    "given their ubiquity in nature , long chain macromolecules have been the subject of considerable study .",
    "whereas there is now a reasonably firm basis for understanding the physical properties of homopolymers@xcite , considerably less is known about the heteropolymers of biological significance . from a biologist s perspective , it is the specific properties of a particular molecule that are of interest .",
    "after all the genetic information is coded by very specific sequences of nucleic acids , which are in turn translated to the chain of amino acids forming a protein@xcite .",
    "the energy of the polymer is determined by the van der waals , hydrogen bonding , hydrophobic / hydrophilic , and coulomb interactions between its constituent amino acids . in accord to these interactions",
    ", the protein folds into a specific shape that is responsible for its activity .",
    "given the large number of monomers making up such chains , and the complexity of their interactions , finding the configuration of a particular molecule is a formidable task .",
    "by contrast , a physicist s approach is to sacrifice the specificity , in the hope of gleaning some more general information from simplified models@xcite .",
    "there are in fact a number of statistical descriptions of _ ensembles _ of molecules composed of a random linear sequence of elements with a variety of interactions that determine their final shapes@xcite .",
    "these simple models of heteropolymers are of additional interest as examples of disordered systems with connections to spin ",
    "glasses @xcite , with the advantage of faster relaxation @xcite .",
    "there are a number of recent experimental studies of solutions@xcite and gels@xcite of polymers that incorporate randomly charged groups .",
    "as statistical approaches only provide general descriptions of such heteropolymers , we focus on simple models which include the essential ingredients .",
    "the overall size and shape of a polymer with charged groups is most likely controlled by the coulomb interactions that are the strongest and with the longest range .",
    "we shall consider the typical properties of a model _ polyampholyte _",
    "( pa)@xcite : a flexible chain in which each of the @xmath5 monomers has a fixed charge @xmath0 selected from a well defined ensemble of quenches .",
    "the polymer has a characteristic microscopic length @xmath6 ( such as range of the excluded ",
    "volume interaction , or nearest neighbor distance along the chain ) . in the numerical studies",
    "we further simplify the model by considering only self  avoiding walk ( saw ) configurations on a cubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath6 .",
    "the long range nature of the coulomb interactions , combined with the randomness of the charge sequence , produces effects quite distinct from systems with short range interactions . in section [ secgend ]",
    "we use the knowledge accumulated in previous studies@xcite to explore the phase diagrams of quenched pas in @xmath7 dimensions . in particular , we show that for @xmath8 , the behavior of pas is similar to that of random chains with short  range interactions , while for @xmath9 the spatial conformations of a pa strongly depend on its excess charge @xmath10 . in every space dimension @xmath9",
    ", there is a critical charge @xmath11 such that pas with @xmath12 can not form a compact state .",
    "the probability of a randomly charged pa to have such an excess charge depends on both @xmath7 and its length . in the @xmath13",
    "limit the excess charge will always ( i.e. with probability 1 ) be `` small '' for @xmath14 and `` big '' for @xmath15 .",
    "thus investigation of the `` borderline '' three  dimensional case provides valuable insight into the behavior of the system in general space dimensions .    in section [ secgen ]",
    "we summarize previous results for pas in @xmath16 : analytical arguments and monte carlo ( mc ) studies indicate that the pa undergoes a transition from a dense ( `` globular '' ) to a strongly stretched configuration as @xmath1 exceeds @xmath17 .",
    "the mc simulations@xcite were performed for polymer sizes up to @xmath18 and in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "they , however , could not provide information on the energy spectrum of pas , and on very low temperature properties . in this work",
    "we undertake a complete enumeration study of pas for all possible quenches up to @xmath19 , and are thus able to present very detailed results regarding energetics and spatial conformations of short pas .",
    "the details of the enumeration procedure are explained in section [ secenum ] , while the results are described in sections [ secenspec ] and [ secshape ] .",
    "the majority of these results add further support to the predictions of mc studies , and provide some details which could not be measured by mc ( e.g. , density of states , condensation energy , and surface tension in the globular phase ) .",
    "we also find some indication that pas with small @xmath1 may undergo a phase transition between two dense states .",
    "no signs of this transition could be detected in the mc studies , because it occurs at temperatures too low for that procedure to equilibrate .",
    "it is helpful to view the problem in the more general context of a variable space dimension @xmath7 .",
    "let us consider a continuum limit in which configurations of the pa are described by a function @xmath20 .",
    "the continuous index @xmath21 is used to label the monomers along the chain , while @xmath22 is the position of the monomer in @xmath7dimensional embedding space .",

    "for each pa , there is a specific ( quenched ) function @xmath27 representing the charges along the chain .",
    "( in this work we set @xmath28 and measure @xmath2 in energy units . )    in the simplest ensemble of quenches , each monomer takes a charge @xmath0 independent of all the others ; i.e. @xmath29 , where the overline indicates averaging over quenches . while the average charge of such pas is zero , a `` typical '' sequence has an excess charge of about @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "this statement , as well as the definition of @xmath32 , are unrelated to the embedding dimension @xmath7 . however",
    ", the importance of charge fluctuations ( both for the overall polymer , or large segments of it ) does depend on the space dimension .",
    "the electrostatic energy of the excess charge , spread over the characteristic size of an ideal polymer ( @xmath33 ) , grows as @xmath34 .",
    "this simple dimensional argument shows that for @xmath8 weak electrostatic interactions are irrelevant .",
    "( the excluded volume effects are also irrelevant in @xmath8 . )",
    "thus , at high temperatures the pa behaves as an ideal polymer with an entropy  dominated free energy of the order of @xmath35 .",
    "however , on lowering temperature it collapses into a dense state , taking advantage of a condensation energy of the order of @xmath36 .",
    "this collapse is similar to the well known @xmath37transition of polymers with short range interactions and will be discussed later in this section .    for @xmath9 ,",
    "electrostatic interactions are relevant and the high temperature phase is no longer a regular self  avoiding walk . at high temperatures the behavior of the polymer can be studied perturbatively . for the above ensemble of uncorrelated charges , the lowest order ( @xmath38 ) correction to the quench  averaged @xmath39 vanishes@xcite .",
    "however , if we restrict the ensemble of quenches to sequences with a fixed overall excess charge of @xmath1 , there is a lowest order correction term proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "thus pas with @xmath1 less than @xmath32 contract while those with larger charges expand .",
    "this trend appears in any space dimension @xmath7 , and is indicated by the vertical line at the top of fig .",
    "it should be noted that restricting the ensemble to yield fixed @xmath1 , slightly modifies the quench  averaged charge  charge correlations . in particular , the two  point correlation function becomes @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "this small ( order of @xmath43 ) correction to the correlation function may cause a significant change in @xmath39 due to the long range nature of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the above discussion can be extended to pas with short  range correlations along the sequence : if neighboring charges satisfy @xmath44@xcite where @xmath45 , with no further restrictions , then @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting ensembles continuously interpolate between the deterministic extremes of an alternating sequence ( @xmath47 ) and a uniformly charged polyelectrolyte ( @xmath48 ) . as in the case of uncorrelated charges",
    ", we can impose an additional constraint on the overall charge , resulting in correlations @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "we note that the variance of @xmath1 in such a correlated sequence also becomes @xmath51 .",
    "thus the proportion of quenches with @xmath1 above or below @xmath52 is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "all the results for uncorrelated sequences remain valid if we substitute @xmath52 for @xmath32 . as @xmath54 , the behavior of the pa crosses over from that of a random sequence to the deterministic ( alternating or homogeneous ) one .",
    "however , the crossover occurs only for @xmath55 .",
    "as typical of the qualitative behavior outside this narrow interval , we concentrate on the uncorrelated case of @xmath56 .",
    "a short distance cutoff @xmath6 , such as the range of the excluded volume interaction , introduces a temperature scale @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath8 the electrostatic interactions in random pas are effectively short  ranged .",
    "previous results on a random short range interaction model@xcite ( rsrim ) in @xmath16 indicate that , as long as the positive and negative charges are approximately balanced , the polymer assumes spatial conformations where the interactions are predominantly attractive . to maximize this attraction ,",
    "the chain undergoes a transition from an expanded to a collapsed ( dense ) state at a @xmath37transition . for truly short range interactions ,",
    "the @xmath37transition disappears only for a rather strong charge imbalance of @xmath58 .",
    "even if as a result of the relevant coulomb interactions in @xmath9 , the high temperature phase of uncorrelated pas turns out to be compact , we can not exclude the possibility of a transition into another dense ( possibly glassy ) state when @xmath2 decreases below a critical @xmath59 .",
    "such a potential `` @xmath59transition '' , indicated by the horizontal dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figa ] , must be different from a regular collapse since the lower density phase is not a self  avoiding walk .",
    "the compact phase can also be destroyed by increasing the net charge as described in the following paragraph .",
    "a dense globular pa droplet of radius @xmath60 has a surface energy of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the surface tension . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "the surface tension keeps the pa in an approximately spherical shape .",
    "however , as shown in appendix  [ secrayleigh ] , at sufficiently large @xmath1 electrostatic forces destabilize the droplet . comparing the electrostatic ( @xmath63 ) and surface energies",
    "indicates that the droplet shape is controlled by the parameter @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the _",
    "rayleigh charge_. for a large enough @xmath66 a spherical shape is unstable ( a charged liquid droplet disintegrates ) .",
    "the rayleigh charge in @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath67 , while for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) it increases faster ( slower ) than @xmath32 .",
    "the solid vertical line at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ figa ] shows the position of this instability in @xmath16 .",
    "clearly , any @xmath59transition ( if at all present ) must also terminate at @xmath11 .",
    "only a negligible fraction of random quenches in @xmath14 have @xmath1 exceeding @xmath11 , and thus a typical pa is a spherical droplet at low @xmath2 .",
    "conversely , in @xmath15 almost all pas have charges larger than @xmath11 and the dense phase does not exist . the borderline case of @xmath16 , where a finite fraction of pas have @xmath1 exceeding @xmath11 , is the most controversial : an analogy with uniformly charged polyelectrolytes@xcite suggests@xcite that the pa is fully stretched ( @xmath68 ) in this case@xcite . by contrast , a debye",
    "hckel inspired theory@xcite predicts that low@xmath2 configurations are compact .",
    "partial resolution of this contradiction comes from the observation@xcite that pas in @xmath16 are extremely sensitive to the excess charge @xmath1 . in the following section we shall briefly review the main features of three  dimensional pas obtained by mc simulations@xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are performed on a discretized version of eq .",
    "( [ continuumh ] ) .",
    "configurations of a polymer are specified by listing the position vectors @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) of its monomers .",
    "the shape and spatial extent of the polymer are then characterized by the tensor , @xmath71 with the greek indices labeling the various components .",
    "thermal averages of the eigenvalues @xmath72 of this tensor ( sometimes referred to as moments of inertia ) are used to describe the mean size and shape ; their sum is the squared radius of gyration , @xmath73 . since we are dealing with sequences of quenched disorder , these quantities must also be averaged over different realizations of @xmath74 . in three dimensions , uniform uncharged polymers in good solvents",
    "are swollen ; their @xmath75 scaling as @xmath76 with @xmath77 as in self  avoiding walks .",
    "polymers in poor solvents are `` compact '' , i.e. described by @xmath78 .",
    "in previous work@xcite we used monte carlo ( mc ) simulations ( along with analytical arguments ) to establish the following properties for pas immersed in a good solvent :    \\(a ) the radius of gyration strongly depends on the total excess charge @xmath1 , and is weakly influenced by other details of the random sequence .",
    "\\(b ) a @xmath38expansion indicates that the size of a pa tends to decrease upon lowering temperature if @xmath1 is less than a critical charge @xmath31 , and increases otherwise .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by mc simulations .",
    "\\(c ) at low temperatures , neutral polymers ( @xmath79 ) are compact in the sense that their spatial extent in any direction grows as @xmath80 , where @xmath6 is a microscopic length scale .",
    "\\(d ) the low@xmath2 size of the pa exhibits a sharp dependence on its charge : @xmath75 is almost independent of @xmath1 for @xmath81 , and grows rapidly beyond this point .",
    "this increase becomes sharper as the temperature is lowered , or as the length of the chain is made longer .",
    "we interpret the low temperature results by an analogy to the behavior of a charged liquid drop . the energy ( or rather the quench averaged free energy ) of the pa is phenomenologically related to its shape by @xmath82 the first term is a condensation energy proportional to the volume ( assumed compact ) , the second term is proportional to the surface area @xmath83 ( with a surface tension @xmath84 ) , while the third term represents the long range part of the electrostatic energy due to an excess charge @xmath1 ( @xmath85 is a dimensionless constant of order unity ) .",
    "the optimal shape is obtained by minimizing the overall energy .",
    "the first term is the same for all compact shapes , while the competition between the surface and electrostatic energies is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath86 here @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the radius and volume of a spherical drop of @xmath5 particles , and we have defined the _",

    "we argued in ref.@xcite that the quenched pa has a similar instability at the vertical line in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ figa ] : charged beyond a critical @xmath66 , the pa splits to form a _ necklace _ of blobs connected by strands . from the definition of @xmath11 it is clear that it is proportional to @xmath32 ; the dimensionless prefactor relating the two depends on @xmath84 and is estimated in this work .",
    "\\(e ) while confirming the general features of fig .",
    "[ figa ] , the mc simulations provide no indication of the suggested @xmath59 transition .",
    "however , these simulations are not reliable at very low temperatures@xcite due to the slowing  down of the equilibration process .",
    "all the above results were obtained by mc simulations for pas of between 16 and 128 monomers . since the mc procedure does not provide good equilibration at low @xmath2 , we could not determine the properties of the ground states ( although some conclusions were drawn from the low@xmath2 data ) .",
    "systems with coulomb interactions are particularly poorly equilibrated , even at densities of only 10% the maximal value . to remedy these difficulties ,",
    "in this work we resorted to complete enumeration of all possible spatial conformations , and all possible quenched charge sequences .",
    "while such an approach enables us to obtain exact results , and detailed information not available in mc studies , the immensity of configuration space restricts the calculation to chains of at most 12 steps ( 13 monomers ) .",
    "we considered self  avoiding walks ( saws ) on a simple cubic lattice of spacing @xmath6 .",
    "an @xmath90step saw has @xmath91 sites ( atoms ) , and the randomly charged polymer is defined by assigning a fixed sequence of charges ( @xmath92 ) to its monomers .",
    "the charge sequence is considered to be quenched , i.e. it remains unchanged when the spatial conformation of the walk changes .",
    "the energy of any particular configuration is given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the position of the @xmath95th atom on the three  dimensional lattice .",
    "thermal averages of various quantities are calculated by summing over all conformations with the boltzmann weights of this energy .",
    "the resulting average is quench specific .",
    "we then obtain quenched averages by summing over all possible realizations of the sequence , possibly with certain restrictions such as on the total excess charge @xmath96 .",
    "our calculation consists of three steps : ( a ) generating lists of all spatial conformations and quench sequences ; ( b ) using the lists to calculate various thermodynamic quantities for each quenched configuration ; ( c ) averaging of results over restricted ensembles of quenches , and analyzing the data . since the calculational procedure is extremely time consuming , we used precalculated lists of all saws , and of all possible sequences of charges along the chains .",
    "other programs then used these two lists as input .",
    "since the first list of all @xmath90step saws with @xmath97 is extremely large , we tried to reduce it by including only `` truly different '' configurations and listing their degeneracies .",
    "as the actual position of a walk in space is not important , we disregard it and only give the _ directions _ of the @xmath90 steps .",
    "as the energy of a configuration is independent of its overall orientation , we assume that the first step is taken in the @xmath98 direction .",
    "the above trivial symmetries are not included in our counting ; e.g. we assign a completely straight line the degeneracy of @xmath99 .",
    "all saws , except for the straight line , have a four fold degeneracy related to rotation around the direction of the initial step .",
    "we shall therefore assume that the first step which is not in @xmath98 direction is taken along the @xmath100 axis , and attribute a degeneracy @xmath101 to all walks which are not straight lines .",
    "every non  planar walk has an additional degeneracy due to reflection in the @xmath102 plane , leading to a total degeneracy of @xmath103 .",
    "thus the list of all 12step saws consists of the directions of 11 successive steps , along with a degeneracy factor .",
    "the total number of 4,162,866 chains consists of one straight line ( @xmath99 ) , 40,616 planar saws ( @xmath101 ) , and 4,122,249 non ",
    "planar saws ( @xmath103 ) . accounting for degeneracies",
    "reduces the length of the list and the time needed to calculate various quantities by almost a factor of eight .",
    "some chains possess additional symmetries ; e.g. , by inverting the sequence of steps we may get some other saw in the list . we did not take advantage of this symmetry because the distribution of quenched charges on the chain is not necessarily symmetric under interchange of its two ends . in any case , we use the end to end exchange symmetry in the listing of all possible quenches .",
    "a second input list contains all possible charge sequences ; each  quench \" for an @xmath90step walk has @xmath91 charges . since the energy is unchanged by reversing the signs of all charges , we considered only configurations in which the total charge is @xmath104 .",
    "this shortens the list by almost a factor of 2 .",
    "the majority of quenches are not symmetric under order reversal , i.e. the sequence does not coincide with itself when listed backwards . since we are exploring all spatial configurations , without accounting for the end ",
    "reversal symmetry mentioned in the previous paragraph , the list can be reduced by almost another factor of 2 by considering only one of each pair of such quenches ( keeping track of the degeneracy ) . after accounting for both charge and sequence reversal symmetries ,",
    "the list for @xmath105 ( @xmath19 ) has only 2080 entries .    for any sequence ,",
    "the number of computer operations required to calculate the energy of a single configuration grows as @xmath106 .",
    "the total number of saws grows as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the effective coordination number for saws on a cubic lattice , and @xmath109 .",
    "the number of  quenches \" grows as @xmath110 .",
    "these factors limit the size of chains which can be investigated to @xmath105 steps . at this @xmath90 we needed 4 weeks of cpu time on a silicon graphics r4000 workstation .",
    "an increase of @xmath90 by a single unit multiplies the calculation time by an order of magnitude .",
    "thus it is impractical to employ our procedure for chains that are much longer than 12 steps .",
    "if , instead of completely enumerating all possible charge configurations we confine ourselves to sampling a few hundred quenches , the calculations can be extended to @xmath111 , but not much further .",
    "the order in which the calculations were performed is as follows : for each saw configuration we calculated the radius of gyration , squared end  to ",
    "end distance , _ and _ the energies of all possible quenched charge configurations along the backbone .",
    "these energies were then used to update histogram tables ( a separate histogram of possible energies for each quench ) . due to the long range nature of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "the allowed energies form almost a continuous spectrum which we discretized in units of @xmath112 .",
    "this discretization was sufficient to accurately reproduce properties of the system on the temperature scales of interest .",
    "( for @xmath113 , we used a finer division of the histograms to verify that the discretization process does not distort calculation of such properties as the specific heat , except at extremely low temperatures . ) in addition to histograms , we also collected data about the energy , the radius of gyration , and the end  to  end distance at the ground state of each quench .",
    "the issue of the multiplicity of the ground state is of much interest , and hotly debated in the context of models of proteins@xcite . in the presence of coulomb interactions , due to the quasi  continuous nature of the energy spectrum , the ground state is almost never degenerate ( except for the trivial degeneracies mentioned above ) .",
    "it is quite likely that , for sufficiently long polymers and specific quenches , there may be exactly degenerate ground states which are not related by symmetry operations .",
    "however , for @xmath114 such cases are extremely rare . moreover , the distance between the ground state and the second  lowest energy state remains of the order of @xmath112 for all @xmath90s in our calculation , even though at higher energies the densities of the states increase very rapidly with @xmath90 .",
    "we used this data to obtain averages over quenches ( with or without a constraint on the net charge ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that creation of histograms , as well as calculation of the thermal averages , required the correct accounting of degeneracies of spatial conformations , while averages over quenches needed proper care of the sequence degeneracies .",
    "for few selected quenches we also performed a calculation of the density of states as a function of two variables , the energy and the squared radius of gyration . due to large amount of data , we could not do such detailed studies for all possible quenches .    fig .",
    "[ figb ] depicts ground states of four cases of quenched charges with different excess charges @xmath1 .",
    "it provides qualitative support for the conclusions previously obtained for mc simulations : fig .",
    "[ figb]a depicts the ground state configuration of an almost neutral pa which is quite compact .",
    "the pa in fig .",
    "[ figb]b has @xmath1 slightly smaller than @xmath32 ; while the configuration is still compact we see the beginning of a stretching . figs .",
    "[ figb]c and [ figb]d show strongly stretched configurations in cases where @xmath1 exceeds @xmath32 . in the following sections we will quantify this qualitative observations .    as a by  product of the above procedure we also obtained similar data for the model with short  range interactions : in the random short range interaction model ( rsrim ) , a quenched sequence of dimensionless charges @xmath115 is defined along the chain . the interaction energy is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 if @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , otherwise .",
    "while we shall compare and contrast several properties of short and long range models in this paper , detailed results for rsrim can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the additional data were gathered without a substantial increase in the total execution time of the programs .",
    "there are a few minor differences in the data collection process in the two models : ( a ) as the energies of the rsrim are naturally discretized , the resulting histograms are exact .",
    "( b ) the ground state of most quenches is highly degenerate .",
    "this required keeping track of the degeneracy , and obtaining the @xmath39 in the ground state as an average lowest energy configurations .",
    "we begin our analysis by testing the validity of eq .",
    "( [ edefenerg ] ) for the ground states of the polymers .",
    "obviously , the exact value of each ground state energy depends on the details of the charge sequence .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ edefenerg ] ) implies that the effect of the overall charge can be ( approximately ) separated ; the remaining parts of the energy depending only weakly on the details of the sequence .",
    "the basic energy unit of our model is @xmath120 , and a useful system for comparison is the regular crystal formed by alternating charges ( the `` sodium chloride '' structure ) .",
    "the condensation energy per atom of such a crystal ( @xmath121 ) is much smaller than the interaction energy per atom between the nearest neighbors ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of the long  range coulomb interaction : although the system is locally neutral , the ground state energy depends on an extended neighborhood .",
    "similarly , the surface tension @xmath123 of the crystal is quite small .",

    "( there is only one quench with @xmath126 . ) while each band has a finite width , we see that the energy of a pa can be determined rather accurately by only specifying its net charge @xmath1 ! _ this is not the case for short  range interactions : _ a comparison of histograms of ground state energies between ( a ) pas and ( b ) rsrim of length @xmath127 in fig .",
    "[ figd ] clearly shows the importance of long range interactions .",
    "there is a rather clear separation of energies into ` bands ' with fixed values of @xmath1 for the pas , which is almost absent in the rsrim .",
    "of course , the finite width of each ` band ' shows that the details of the sequence can not be completely neglected , although their influence on the ground state energy is rather small .    using a debye  hckel approximation@xcite , wittmer _",

    "( [ qqcorr ] ) ) .",
    "they obtain an expression which smoothly interpolates between the free energy densities of a completely random sequence ( @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the debye screening length ) , and non - random alternating sequence ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "( the latter model was also studied in ref.@xcite . )",
    "these results exclude the electrostatic self  interaction energy , which is infinite in the continuum model used in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus the free energy of the alternating chain is roughly 20 times smaller than the random one . while these results can not be directly extended to the ground states , we may attempt to obtain crude estimates by setting @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "however , our results indicate that the ground state energy of alternating polymers ( @xmath133 ) is only smaller by about 16% than the mean condensation energy of unrestricted sequences . such inconsistency",
    "is partially explained by the fact that the alternating pa has negative mean electrostatic energy ( approximately @xmath134 per atom ) even at @xmath135 , while such an energy for a completely random pa ( averaged over all quenches ) vanishes .",
    "thus , only about 1/4 of the ground state energy of an alternating pa is its condensation energy .",
    "( this part of the energy explicitly depends on the discreteness of the chain and is not accounted for in ref.@xcite . )",

    "the condensation energy @xmath144 is surprisingly close to that of a regular crystal ( @xmath121 ) , despite the fact that in a random chain on average one neighbor ( along the chain ) has the `` wrong '' sign ( compared to the alternating arrangement ) , costing an energy of the order of @xmath145 .",
    "this again confirms our contention that the ground state energy is determined by very extended neighborhoods of each particle",
    ". if the ground state configuration has approximately cubic or spherical shape , then @xmath146 , while for the slightly elongated objects that we obtain , @xmath138 can be somewhat larger ( @xmath147 ) .",

    "the error bars indicate our uncertainty in the values of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , and disregard possible systematic errors in attempts to evaluate surface tension from such small clusters . using these numbers we estimate that the rayleigh charge of the model pa is approximately the same as @xmath32 , since @xmath149 ( the relation @xmath150 assumes pas of maximum possible density . ) from fig .",
    "[ fige ] it is not clear that the ( charge unconstrained ) average energies ( indicated by the @xmath151 symbols ) of all quenches , also extrapolate to the same condensation energy of @xmath144 .",
    "this apparent inconsistency can be understood by noting that since the quench averaged @xmath143 is equal to @xmath152 , the last term in eq .",

    "thus , the linear approach ( in the variables used in fig .",
    "[ fige ] ) to asymptotic value ( as @xmath154 ) is replaced by a very small power law .",
    "such a slow decay can not be detected for the small values of @xmath5 used in our enumeration study .",
    "since our model is defined on a discrete lattice , the allowed energies are discrete . however , as the length of the chain increases the separations between the states are reduced .",
    "the density of states becomes quasi  continuous and can be described by a function @xmath155 .",
    "[ figf ] depicts @xmath156 , where the overline denotes averaging over all quenches with a fixed @xmath1 .",

    "not surprisingly , the densities of states for different @xmath1s are shifted with respect to each other . for",
    "every quench the density of states is very high near the middle of the band and decreases towards the edges .",
    "we find that almost all pas have a unique ground state ( up to trivial symmetry transformations ) .",
    "this is not the case for short range interactions@xcite and may be an important clue to the problem of protein folding .",
    "( for ease of calculation , most studies of similar random copolymers have focused on short - range interactions , and typically find highly degenerate ground states . ) furthermore , the gaps to the second lowest energy states typically remain of order of @xmath159 ( up to the studied size of @xmath105 ) , while most interstate separations decrease with @xmath90 . in the @xmath160 limit , the density of lowest energy excitations of our model pas appears to decay faster than a power law .",
    "( of course our lattice model does not include any vibrational modes . )",

    "the solid lines represent the quench averaged heat capacities per degree of freedom @xmath162 , of pas with @xmath79 at low temperatures .",
    "( since the energy fluctuations of a polymer depend only on changes of its shape , and are independent of its overall position and orientation , we assumed that an @xmath5atom pa has @xmath163 degrees of freedom , where @xmath164 represents subtraction of translational and rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "such a choice decreases the bias in the @xmath5dependence of @xmath162 which would appear for very small values of @xmath5 . )",
    "the vanishing heat capacity was _ not _ observed in mc studies@xcite , where poor equilibration at low @xmath2 hinders measurement of @xmath162 .",
    "it is instructive to compare and contrast the behavior of random pas with vanishing excess charge to that of an ordered alternating sequence ; the latter is a highly atypical member of the ensemble with @xmath79 .",
    "numerical investigations of alternating charge sequences by victor and imbert@xcite show that such polymers undergo a collapse transition , similar to saws with _ short range _ attractive interactions .",
    "this is because the exact compensation in the charges of any pair of neighboring monomers leads to large scale properties determined by dipole ",

    "by contrast , even though we consider a sub  ensemble of quenches with @xmath79 , the charge fluctuations can not be neglected in random pas and control the long distance behavior of the chain .",
    "such pas are compact at _ any _ temperature .    the attractive dipole ",
    "dipole interactions eventually cause the collapse of the alternating charge sequence to a compact state at temperatures below a @xmath37point . of course",
    ", the ground state of such a chain is the ordered nacl crystal discussed earlier .",
    "however , it is not clear if the state of the chain immediately below the @xmath37 temperature is the ordered crystal .",
    "another possibility is that the initial collapse is into a  molten globular \" ( liquid like ) state @xcite , which then crystallizes at a lower temperature .",
    "we singled out the alternating pas in our complete ensemble of quenches ; the dashed lines in fig .  [ figg ] depict the heat capacity of this sequence .",
    "the presence of a phase transition manifests itself in the peak in @xmath162 at @xmath165 ( for @xmath166 ) which grows ( and slightly shifts towards higher temperatures ) as @xmath90 increases .",
    "[ figg ] shows that the average heat capacity of random pas with @xmath79 also has a peak at @xmath167 ( for @xmath166 ) .",
    "as the high temperature phase is no longer swollen ( for @xmath79 ) , there are again two possible interpretations of this heat capacity peak .",
    "one is that it represents a crossover remnant of the @xmath37 transition , with an increase in the density of the compact polymer .",
    "indeed , the peak is lower and broader than that of alternating chains .",
    "another possibility is that there is a  glass \" transition in which the  molten globule \" freezes into its ` ground state ' .",
    "the proximity of the peak temperature to the energy gap for the first excited state supports the latter conclusion .",
    "no corresponding anomaly was observed in the mc simulations@xcite . since",
    "finite size effects are extremely important in such small systems , the heat capacity peak should be regarded only as a suggestion for the presence of a  @xmath59transition \" . as indicated by the dashed line in fig",
    ".  [ figa ] , the location of such a transition may depend on @xmath1 , disappearing at @xmath168 , consistent with other features of the phase diagram .",
    "this behavior is analogous to that of the @xmath37point in the rsrim@xcite , although in that case the limiting charge scales linearly with @xmath5 .",
    "additional , studies are needed to establish the @xmath59transition .",
    "the contour plots in fig .",
    "[ figh ] depict the number of states as a function of both @xmath39 and @xmath169 , for three sequences of @xmath127 with charges @xmath124 ( a ) , 5 ( b ) , and 11 ( c ) . at high temperatures",
    "the typical configurations correspond to the highest densities . in all three cases these configurations",
    "are located in the middle of the diagram , and behave essentially as saws . on",
    "lowering temperature the polymer seeks out states of lowest energy which are very different in the three cases .",
    "the approximately neutral chain of fig .",
    "[ figh]a assumes a very compact shape represented by the lower  left corner of the contours .",
    "the presence of a specific heat peak is consistent with the shape of this contour plot .",
    "while @xmath39 increases monotonically with @xmath2 , the chains are too short to permit a quantitative test for the presence of a @xmath59point from the scaling of @xmath39 .",
    "the lowest energy contour of the chain with @xmath170 ( fig .",
    "[ figh]b ) is almost horizontal .",
    "hence , upon lowering temperature the chain will not collapse , maintaining an extended shape .",
    "thus a putative transition must disappear for larger @xmath1 . finally , the fully charged polymer in fig .",
    "[ figh]c expands from a saw to the completely stretched configurations represented by the lower ",
    "right corner of the contour plot .",
    "the low temperature results from mc simulations suggest that @xmath39 of a pa strongly depends on its charge , crossing over from compact configurations at small @xmath1 to extended states for larger @xmath1 .",
    "this is qualitatively supported by the ground state shapes in fig .",
    "[ figb ] , and will be more quantitatively examined here .",
    "[ figi]a depicts the @xmath90dependence of @xmath39 for several choices of @xmath1 .",
    "the vertical axis is scaled so that compact , i.e. fixed density , structures are represented by horizontal lines . since @xmath1 is fixed , the influence of the excess charge diminishes as the length of the polymer is increased , and thus all curves must asymptotically converge to the same horizontal line .",
    "there is some indication of this in fig .",
    "[ figi]a , although the crossover is rather delayed for larger values of @xmath1 . since the unrestricted ensemble ( solid circles ) includes a large range of @xmath1s , it is not surprising that the corresponding averages are not compact .",
    "the chains are too short to extract a meaningful value for the exponent @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , the effective slope of @xmath171 , strongly suggests that the average over an unrestricted ensemble is not compact . by comparison , the corresponding results for the rsrim in fig .",
    "[ figi]b clearly indicate that the averages both at fixed and varying @xmath1 have similar fixed density ground states .    since the quench ",
    "averaged @xmath39 of the unrestricted ensemble scales differently from the sub  ensembles of fixed @xmath1 , the former set must contain a non  negligible portion of non  compact configurations for every @xmath90 .",
    "it is natural to assume that the borderline between compact and stretched states is controlled by @xmath67 . in previous work@xcite",
    "we argued that pas undergo a transition to an expanded state when @xmath1 exceeds @xmath11 ( @xmath172 ) : the transition is more pronounced for larger @xmath90 and lower @xmath2 . in the mc",
    "simulations@xcite we were able to use long pas , but were restricted to finite , albeit small , temperatures which slightly smeared the transition in @xmath75 with increasing @xmath1 . in this study we know the exact ground states but are limited to small @xmath90s where the difference between @xmath75 of compact and stretched states is less visible .",
    "the sum of all eigenvalues of the shape tensor , @xmath39 is somewhat insensitive to an expansion since the increase in the largest eigenvalue is partially compensated by the decrease of the other two eigenvalues .",
    "a clearer view is provided by the ratios of the mean eigenvalues of the shape tensor as depicted in fig .",
    "these ratios for different @xmath90s can be collapsed after scaling the charges by @xmath32 , consistent with the mc simulations .",
    "[ figk ] depicts ( on a logarithmic scale ) the distribution of values of @xmath39 in the ground states of all quenches for @xmath111 .",
    "the distribution is peaked near the smallest possible value of @xmath39 , but has a broad ( possibly power law ) tail .",
    "if the tail falls off sufficiently slowly , it will determine the asymptotic value of the exponent @xmath4 : as @xmath90 increases the very large values of @xmath39 of the ( minority ) stretched configurations will eventually dominate the total average .",
    "we thus expect @xmath173 to increase with @xmath90 , and the value of @xmath173 extracted from the slope of the solid line on fig .",
    "[ figi]a , probably underestimates the true asymptotic value . to get further insight into the behavior for larger @xmath90",
    ", we performed separate averages for the 80% of configurations which have the smallest @xmath39 , and for the remaining top 20% .",
    "these averages are depicted in fig .",
    "the vertical axis is again scaled so that compact structures are represented by horizontal lines .",
    "the bottom 80% indeed scale as compact chains while the top 20% , which stand for the tail of the distribution , have radii that grow with @xmath90 with an effective exponent of @xmath174 .",
    "we thus conclude that the @xmath39 of the unrestricted ensemble increases with @xmath90 at least as fast as a saw .",
    "as a byproduct of our study , since we have access to the complete set of quenches , we can find which particular sequence , restricted only by its net charge , has the lowest energy . as this is the sequence that is selected in a model in which the charges are free to change positions along the chain , we shall refer to the results as describing the ground states of _ annealed pas_. for long chains , neither the sequence , nor its spatial conformation , need to be unique .",
    "however , for the sizes considered here , we always found a single ground state , several of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ figm ] for @xmath111 and different values of @xmath1 .",
    "it appears that the optimal configurations correspond to a uniform distribution of excess charge along the backbone . in particular , for small @xmath1 the preferred arrangement is the alternating sequence which then folds into a nacl structure .",
    "previously@xcite we suggested that annealed pas expel their excess charge ( provided @xmath175 ) into highly charged `` fingers '' . as a result of such `` charge expulsion '' the spanning length of annealed",
    "pas should increase dramatically ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "however , since most of the mass remains in a compact globule , @xmath39 is not substantially modified ( as long as @xmath177 ) .",
    "the chains used in our study are too short to exhibit an increased spanning length with no change in @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , the effects of lattice discreteness are much more pronounced for annealed pas where ground states correspond to a single sequence . in the quenched case , averaging over all sequences partially smoothens out lattice effects . as partial evidence",
    "we note that plots for the charge dependence of ratios of eigenvalues of the shape tensor ( analogous to fig .",
    "[ figj ] ) exhibit better collapse with the variable @xmath178 than with @xmath179 .",
    "however , given the scatter of the few data points , the evidence for the appearance of `` fingers '' is not really any more convincing than any conclusions drawn from inspection of the ground states in fig .",
    "[ figm ] .",
    "as noted earlier , we expect the ground state of a sufficiently long annealed pa with fixed @xmath1 to be the nacl structure . to test the approach to this limit , in fig .",
    "[ fign ] we plot the energies per atom of the ground states . as in the case of",
    "quenched pas ( fig .  [ fige ] ) , we check for finite size corrections proportional to the surface area .",

    "the point of intersection with the @xmath182 axis is close to the known value of the @xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath183 corresponds to a surface tension of @xmath184 which is also consistent with the known value of @xmath185 .",

    "the energy of a charged _ conducting _ ( hyper)sphere of radius @xmath87 with charge @xmath1 is given by @xmath186 where the first term is the surface energy ( @xmath84 is the surface tension , and @xmath187 denotes the @xmath7dimensional solid angle ) , while the second term is the electrostatic energy .",
    "( we have used units such that , in @xmath7 dimensions , the electrostatic potential at a distance @xmath188 from a charge @xmath189 is @xmath190 ; and @xmath191 in @xmath192 . ) for small @xmath1 , the sphere is stable with respect to infinitesimal shape perturbations .",

    "when applied to pas , up to a dimensionless prefactor , @xmath197    we can regard the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eeq ] ) as setting the overall energy scale , while the shape of the drop is determined by the dimensionless ratio @xmath198 while from the above argument we conclude that the spherical shape is ( locally ) unstable for @xmath199 , even for @xmath200 , the energy of the drop can be lowered by splitting into smaller droplets .",
    "in particular , we may split away from the original drop a large number @xmath157 , of small droplets of radius @xmath201 and charge @xmath202 , and remove them to infinity .",
    "it can be directly verified that for @xmath203 , the total electrostatic energy , total surface area of the small droplets , as well as their total volume , vanishes in the @xmath204 limit .",
    "thus the energy of any charged conducting drop can be lowered to that of an uncharged drop by expelling a large number of `` dust particles '' which carry away the entire charge .",
    "( of course this argument neglects the finite size of any particles making up the drop ! )    the globular phase of a quenched random pa is better represented by a drop of immobile charges .",
    "therefore , we next consider a drop in which the charges are _ uniformly _ distributed over the volume .",
    "the sum of the surface and electrostatic energies is now given by @xmath205 for sufficiently large @xmath1 , the drop can lower its energy by splitting into two droplets of equal size .",
