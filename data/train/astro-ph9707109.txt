    "the distribution function of neutral hydrogen masses among galaxies and intergalactic clouds ( the mass function or himf ) , and more generally , the neutral hydrogen density in the nearby universe , @xmath9 , are important inputs into models of cosmology and galaxy evolution .",
    "different attempts have been made to construct an himf by using optically selected galaxies ( rao & briggs 1993 , hereafter rb , solanes , giovanelli & haynes 1996 ) .",
    "these studies are based on the assumption that is always associated with optically bright galaxies .",
    "a major concern is whether the himf is complete when it is computed for these galaxies .",
    "for example , the population of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies might hypothetically constitute a substantial portion of the population of nearby extragalactic objects ( disney 1976 , mcgaugh 1996 , dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 , sprayberry et al .",
    "the lsb population easily escapes detection optically and would not be included in the samples that are commonly used to evaluate the himf .",
    "this would be particularly problematic since lsb galaxies are generally found to be rich in neutral gas ( schombert et al .",
    "1992 , de blok , mcgaugh & van der hulst 1996 ) and could therefore contribute substantially to the neutral gas content .",
    "gas rich dwarf galaxies may also play an important part . for example tyson & scalo ( 1988 ) have argued that the majority of these dwarf galaxies remain undetected because only the small portion that is currently undergoing a rapid phase of star formation is presently observed with optical telescopes .",
    "a final possible population of gas rich systems that would escape inclusion in optical catalogs is a class of intergalactic clouds without stars .",
    "so far , only a few such systems have been discovered , and they are always found to be gravitationally bound to a galaxy or a group of galaxies ( for example the leo ring , schneider 1989 ) .",
    "clearly , the himf and the content of the local universe should be measured directly , in such a way that they suffer no bias against gas rich galaxies or intergalactic clouds which are difficult to detect optically .",
    "this is possible by means of surveys in the line .",
    "several of these surveys have been carried out over the last two decades .",
    "the majority were single dish observations using on / off techniques , since these surveys were done in conjunction with observations targeted on cataloged galaxies ( fisher & tully 1981b , giovanelli & haynes 1985 , 1989 ) .",
    "some surveys were concentrated on groups of galaxies ( haynes & roberts 1979 , lo & sargent 1979 , fisher & tully 1981a , hoffman , lu & salpeter 1992 ) to specifically search for clouds in the vicinity of known galaxies .",
    "other surveys were designed to find signals in voids ( krumm & brosch 1984 , szomoru et al 1996 ) , or to compare voids and superclusters ( weinberg et al .",
    "1991 , szomoru et al .",
    "since these surveys are not pointed at randomly chosen regions of sky , they may not provide fair tests of the shape of the himf or an unbiased measure of the average density .",
    "a few truly blind surveys have been conducted , the first one in driftscan mode ( shostak 1977 ) and one by observing a series of pointings on lines of constant declination ( kerr & henning 1987 , henning 1992 ) .",
    "it is worrisome that this latter survey could not reproduce the himf defined for optically selected galaxies , possibly because the survey was targeted toward large volumes of known voids .",
    "another possibility is that the achieved survey sensitivity is not well understood , leading to an underestimation of the true number density of rich galaxies and intergalactic clouds .",
    "more recently , several surveys have been made using the arecibo telescope ( sorar 1994 , spitzak 1996 , schneider 1997 ) .",
    "surveys are in progress at dwingeloo ( dogs ) and at parkes , where the survey will cover the entire southern sky ( staveley - smith et al . 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the arecibo strip survey ( sorar 1994 ) , a blind survey for extragalactic covering @xmath0 square degrees of sky , out to a redshift of 7400 @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis of the survey results will concentrate specifically on the understanding of the achieved survey sensitivity and the vulnerability to large scale structure .",
    "we describe the details of the survey and the optical and 21 cm follow - up observations in section  [ observations.sect ] .",
    "section  [ sensitivity.sect ] gives a detailed analysis of the achieved survey sensitivity .",
    "we present the himf in section  [ himf.sect ] , the possible influence of large scale structure on the determination of the himf is examined by performing numerical experiments , and the cosmological mass density of at the present time is calculated in this section . in section  [ discussion.sect ]",
    "we compare our findings with previous estimates of the himf based on 21 cm surveys and optically selected galaxy samples and discuss the implications of our results .",
    "section  [ conclusions.sect ] summarizes the results .",
    "the distances used in this paper are based on a hubble constant @xmath10 .",
    "the strip survey was carried out on the arecibo 305 m telescope in the period of august 1993 until february 1994 .",
    "the survey was designed to take advantage of periods of construction when the telescope pointing was immobilized but the receiving systems were still operational .",
    "therefore , the data were taken in driftscan mode and the telescope beam traced strips of constant declination . the same strips were retraced for as many as 30 days in order to obtain very sensitive observations that are capable of detecting of low surface density .",
    "the main survey was divided in two sessions : one survey covering 10.5 hours of ra at @xmath11 , and the second survey covering 9.7 hours of ra at @xmath12 .",
    "all observations were made at night .",
    "the limiting column density was @xmath13 ( at a @xmath4 level ) for gas filling the telescope beam , which subtends 3 @xmath14 kpc at 3 @xmath14 mpc and 70 @xmath14 kpc at 74 @xmath14 mpc .",
    "the total sky coverage was approximately 65 square degrees , with a depth of @xmath1  @xmath2 .",
    "the survey was capable of detecting masses of @xmath15 at 7 @xmath14 mpc and @xmath16 at the full depth of the survey , in the main beam which has a fwhm of 3 arcmin .",
    "the first sidelobe of the telescope beam pattern could detect @xmath17 at the full depth of the survey , which makes the sidelobes effective in detecting high mass galaxies over a 15 arcmin wide strip .",
    "the details of the ahiss and the data reduction are described by sorar ( 1994 ) .",
    "a summary of the reduction path is described by briggs et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the survey yielded a total of 61 detections , of which approximately half could be associated with cataloged galaxies listed in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "five detections have no obvious counterparts on the digitized sky survey ( dss ) although they are more than @xmath18 away from the galactic plane .    fig .",
    "[ slices.fig ] shows slice diagrams of the location of all selected objects compared with galaxies in the cfa catalog ( geller & huchra 1989 ) .",
    "galaxies within a @xmath19 strip centered on the declination of the strip are plotted .",
    "different symbols are used to distinguish between cataloged ( circles ) and uncataloged ( boxes ) galaxies .",
    "the size of the symbols reflects the mass of the galaxies , in the sense that bigger symbols indicate larger masses .",
    "the galactic plane intersects the strips at @xmath20 and @xmath21 as indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "the cfa catalog is obviously incomplete in these regions of the sky due to galactic extinction , whereas the survey suffers no bias against detection in these regions .",
    "it is clear from this figure that selected galaxies generally follow the same structures as the optical galaxies .",
    "in particular , if we only consider those regions of the sky where the cfa catalog is complete , we find that more than 80% of the selected galaxies lie in regions where the average galaxies density is higher than the mean density .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that lsb galaxies and gas - rich dwarfs lie on structures delineated by normal , high surface brightness galaxies ( bothun et al .",
    "1986 , thuan , gott & schneider 1987 , eder et al .",
    "1989 , thuan et al .",
    "1991 , mo , mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ) . furthermore",
    ", none of the selected galaxies in the sections where the cfa is complete are found in regions where the galaxy density is less than one fifth of the cosmic mean .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of szomoru et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and weinberg et al .",
    "( 1991 ) that selected galaxies are not found in selected void fields",
    ". a more detailed analysis of the large scale distribution of the selected galaxies will be presented elsewhere .",
    "= 11.5 cm      follow - up 21 cm synthesis observations on all signals found in this survey have been performed with the nrao very large array ( vla ) in d - configuration .",
    "these follow - up observations are essential for three reasons : + 1 ) as stated before , the survey was capable of detecting signals as far as 7 arcmin from the center of the survey strip .",
    "consequently , the coordinates yielded by the survey have uncertainties on the order of several arcminutes .",
    "the association with a cataloged galaxy or a galaxy on the dss is therefore not always unambiguous , especially in those cases where there are several prominent galaxies visible within a 15 arcmin wide strip .",
    "21 cm observations with spatial resolution of @xmath22 arcmin , are sufficient to obtain unique identifications .",
    "+ 2 ) flux measurements from the ahiss can be poor if a signal is detected at large distance from the center of the beam . in principle , a correction to the flux could be made since the response function of the telescope is known with reasonable accuracy , but this is only possible if the positional accuracy is sufficient .",
    "furthermore , measurements from the survey spectra might underestimate the integral flux if the source is more extended than the primary beam .",
    "thus , a rough measure of the distribution increases confidence in the analysis .",
    "+ 3 ) some signals can be caused by pairs or small groups of galaxies , whose line emission might stack up in the same channels .",
    "it is not obvious from the arecibo survey spectra which signals are caused by more than one galaxy .",
    "in fact , this situation was found by the vla observations to occur in five cases .",
    "short vla observations ( @xmath23 20 min ) of all 61 detected galaxies were performed during the d - configuration sessions in may 1995 and september 1996 .",
    "the signal of three systems fell below the detection limit of the snap - shot observation .",
    "these systems were re - observed in the d - configuration during the second session , but with longer integration times ( @xmath23 3 hours ) , resulting finally in confirmation of all 61 detections at levels consistent with the ahiss sensitivity .",
    "the three weaker signals originated in galaxies whose declinations are at the center of the ahiss .",
    "the vla observations were performed using 63 channels over a 3.125 mhz bandwidth , corresponding to a velocity range of approximately 660 @xmath2 .",
    "on - line hanning smoothing was used , resulting in a velocity resolution of @xmath24 @xmath2 .",
    "phase calibrators were observed once for each source .",
    "only seven different phase calibrators were used .",
    "each time that the phase calibrator was changed , a primary flux calibrator ( 3c48 or 3c286 ) was observed in order to tie the flux scales together .",
    "therefore , the primary calibrators were not observed with the same correlator settings as each galaxy , but only with six correlator settings .",
    "the overhead time due to slewing of the telescopes and observations of primary calibrators is significantly decreased this way .",
    "this technique provided adequate passband calibration for these short observations , where high dynamical range or accurate channel - to - channel flux density calibrations are not needed .",
    "there were no strong continuum sources in these fields .    since the observing conditions were generally quite good , little editing was necessary to remove interference and bad baselines .",
    "continuum was removed from the data in the @xmath25-plane , by making linear fits to the real and imaginary components for each visibility in the line - free channels and subtracting the appropriate values from all channels .",
    "the @xmath25 data were calibrated and transformed to datacubes using natural weighting . using natural weighting rather than uniform weighting results in a slightly lower spatial resolution , but higher sensitivity .",
    "the resolution in the transformed datacubes is @xmath26 .",
    "the final r.m.s noise was approximately 1.2 mjy / beam for each channel ( corresponding to a minimal detectable column density of @xmath27 [ @xmath4 ] ) for the short integrations and 0.8 mjy / beam ( limiting column density @xmath29 [ @xmath4 ] ) for the longer integrations . since the observed galaxies were generally barely resolved , cleaning of the data was not really necessary .",
    "nonetheless , because the synthesized beam of these short observations has strong deviations from a gaussian shape , we chose to clean the datacubes and restore them with a gaussian beam in order to make an effective search for companion objects throughout the primary beam .",
    "total masses were calculated using @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the distance to the source in mpc , and @xmath32 is the flux density in mjy over profile width @xmath33 in @xmath2 .",
    "total maps were constructed by adding the regions in the channel maps that contain line emission .",
    "contour maps of emission and global profiles will be presented in a future paper .",
    "[ compmhi.fig ] shows the masses as measured with the vla plotted against the masses that are derived from the ahiss spectra .",
    "different symbols are used to distinguish between single detections ( filled circles ) and multiple detections ( open circles ) .",
    "arecibo measurements of these multiple detections are of course always unreliable estimates of the real masses .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates the fact that the masses derived from the arecibo spectra generally underestimate the true masses , and that follow - up observations were essential to determine accurate measurements . in the analysis of the ahiss results we will use masses calculated from the vla observations , except for galaxies with integrated vla fluxes less than @xmath34 .",
    "galaxies with these low fluxes are only found at small distances from the center of the arecibo beam , where the normalized response function is close to unity .",
    "arecibo measurements for these galaxies are therefore reliable estimates of their real fluxes .",
    "table  [ tabel ] summarizes the global parameters of the detected galaxies which are derived from the vla observations .",
    "the following information is contained : column 1 : identification number of the arecibo detection .",
    "indices indicate multiple detections .",
    "column 2 : name of galaxy if already cataloged .",
    "columns 3 and 4 : b1950 coordinates .",
    "column 5 : logarithm of mass .",
    "column 6 : heliocentric velocity , calculated by taking the mean of the velocities at 20% of peak flux density .",
    "column 7 : declination offset from center of the survey strip .",
    "column 8 : identification code for multiple detections .",
    "we have also started a program of optical @xmath35-band imaging of the selected galaxies with the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) on la palma . during four observing runs in the period between october 1995 and march 1997",
    "we have been able to obtain images of all target galaxies .",
    "the first noteworthy result of the follow - up optical observations is that _ all _ of the sources more than @xmath18 away from the galactic plane are found to be associated with galaxies in the @xmath35-band images .",
    "we have seen no indication that any of the sources detected in the arecibo survey are anything other than ` ordinary ' galaxies having both gas and stars . put another way ,",
    "we have so far failed to find any sources that are pure clouds without stars .",
    "the analysis of the optical observations will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "the improved coordinates and fluxes derived from the vla observations help to verify the completeness limit of the survey .",
    "the detectability is determined in the following way :    the mass in a detected signal can be expressed as @xmath36 , where @xmath31 is the distance to the source in mpc , and @xmath32 is the flux density in mjy that here is considered to be constant over a rectangular profile of width @xmath33 km / s .",
    "the sensitivity of an observation is optimal when the spectra are smoothed to the velocity width of the source . with optimal smoothing",
    "the noise becomes @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the spectral resolution of the receiving system and @xmath39 is the noise level in the unsmoothed spectra .",
    "the limiting flux density @xmath40 for a @xmath41 detection is then given by @xmath42 .",
    "for the ahiss , the average noise level after coadding spectra taken at different days was 0.75 mjy for a velocity resolution of 16 km / s .",
    "the normalized response function of the survey telescope , @xmath43 , describes the relative response to a source which is detected at an offset @xmath44 from the center of the survey strip .",
    "in other words , @xmath43 is the integral of the flux density sensed by the telescope as a source makes a cut through the beam pattern , missing the center of the beam by angle @xmath44 , normalized in such a way that @xmath45 . for the arecibo telescope",
    "this function falls off to @xmath46 at @xmath47 and reaches a second maximum of @xmath48 at @xmath49 due to the high sidelobe level .",
    "we define a correction factor @xmath50 that accounts for the shape of the response function by @xmath51 . the limiting flux density of a galaxy at an offset @xmath44 from the center of the survey strip",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath52 . in general , an source should be detected by the survey if its flux density exceeds this limiting flux density , that is @xmath53 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath54 where we define @xmath55 as the detectability .",
    "the factor @xmath56 represents the normalized feed gain of the telescope , which is a function of frequency .",
    "@xmath56 can be approximated by an analytical expression of the form @xmath57/w)^2 $ ] , where @xmath58 is the frequency in mhz , @xmath59 is the center of the survey band and @xmath60 is a parameter which determines the width of the band . during the observations at @xmath61 the shape of the normalized feed gain remained unchanged and could be satisfactorily fit by @xmath62  mhz and @xmath63  mhz . during the @xmath64 observations ,",
    "the gain was retuned a few times to the settings : @xmath62  mhz and @xmath65  mhz and @xmath66  mhz and @xmath67  mhz .",
    "the @xmath56 dependence of @xmath55 leads to a ` distance dependence ' for the flux density sensitivity .",
    "the sensitivity can now be verified by plotting the detectability @xmath55 of the objects against declination offset from the center of the survey strip .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ sens.fig ] .",
    "all signals that were detected are shown in this plot .",
    "the horizontal errorbars are the result of a combination of positional accuracy in the vla maps and the spatial extent of the galaxies in the direction orthogonal to the survey strip .",
    "the signals corresponding to pair or group detections are indicated by open circles and letters a to e are used to identify these related or confused signals in table  [ tabel ] . filled circles",
    "mark all single object detections .",
    "the solid line represents @xmath68 , the limit to the detectability . in principle",
    ", all filled circles should lie above the solid line , the area below this line is ` undetectable ' . the line is a satisfactory limit to the data points , especially if we consider the naive character of eq.[detect.eq ] .",
    "that is , this equation assumes that the detected profiles are symmetric and featureless .",
    "since the profiles are generally heavily smoothed , this is a reasonable assumption , but lop - sided profiles or strong double horned profiles might exceed the detection limit while they are formally ` undetectable ' according to eq.[detect.eq ] .",
    "the limiting depth @xmath69 , the maximum distance to which the object could be placed and still remain within the sample , can now be expressed as a function of @xmath70 , @xmath44 and @xmath33 : @xmath71    the variation of feed gain with frequency imposes a minor correction to the limiting depth @xmath69 which can be compensated by solving for @xmath69 in @xmath72 that is , the true flux density @xmath73 of a galaxy located at the distance limit @xmath69 multiplied by the feed gain at a frequency corresponding to that distance has to be equal to the limiting flux density @xmath40 obtained at the center frequency , where the feed gain is optimized and the nominal noise level of the system is normally calculated .    the next step is to calculate the effective search volume of the survey . the volume @xmath74 of a slice of the total survey volume at declination @xmath75 and with length @xmath76 ( the total length of the strips in radians , @xmath77 ) and width @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the limiting depth of the survey imposed by the bandwidth of the receiving system .",
    "the total survey volume that is sensitive to a galaxy with mass @xmath70 and velocity spread @xmath81 can then be calculated by taking the integral over @xmath44 . for galaxies in the flux limited regime , for which @xmath82 for each @xmath44 , this integral simply becomes : @xmath83 for galaxies in the bandwidth limited regime , @xmath84 for @xmath44 smaller than a certain critical value @xmath85 .",
    "the integral must now be split up in separate parts for the flux limited regimes and the band width limited regime : @xmath86 where we made use of the symmetry of the beam shape in the last step .",
    "this effective search volume is still dependent on two variables : @xmath70 and @xmath33 .",
    "the most convenient parameterization of @xmath87 for computing an himf is to express @xmath87 as a function of @xmath70 only .",
    "this can be achieved by adopting a relation between @xmath70 and @xmath33 .",
    "such a relation is known to exist since optical luminosity @xmath88 is related to @xmath33 via the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , and @xmath88 is related to @xmath70 as @xmath89 ( see briggs 1990 ) .",
    "briggs & rao ( 1993 , hereafter br ) determined the @xmath70-@xmath33 relation empirically by plotting @xmath33 against log@xmath70 for 1139 optically selected galaxies from the catalog by fisher & tully ( 1981b ) .",
    "a fit to these points gives @xmath90 .",
    "recently , salpeter & hoffman ( 1996 ) analyzed observations of 70 dwarf galaxies and find a similar trend : @xmath91 .",
    "this relation is therefore valid over a wide range in mass .",
    "our data are also in good agreement with this relation .",
    "note that the velocity widths in these relations are not the inclination corrected maximum rotational velocities , but just the observed velocity spreads .",
    "the effective survey volume @xmath92 can now be calculated by substituting the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath70 found by br and @xmath93 into eq.[volume1.eq ] and eq.[volume2.eq ] .",
    "this volume as a function of @xmath70 is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ volume.fig ] . in the flux",
    "limited regime , for masses @xmath94 , the search volume is @xmath95 .",
    "( a proportionality often used in the literature is @xmath96 [ e.g. , henning 1995 , schneider 1997 ] .",
    "this power 3/2 arises if the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath70 is discarded , effectively assuming that all galaxies have the same profile width . ) in the high mass region ( @xmath97 ) , the limiting depths are no longer determined by the detectability of the signals , but simply by the bandwidth of the receiving system .",
    "therefore , the effective survey volume for high mass systems is not dependent on mass or @xmath33 .",
    "the total survey volume in this regime , is @xmath98 . for",
    "lower masses the volume decreases rapidly and is only @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "the dashed and the dotted line show the effective search volume corresponding to the main beam and the sidelobes , respectively .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the sidelobes do not add much volume in the low mass range , but are very effective in finding large masses .",
    "since the observed velocity width is related to inclination @xmath101 and maximum rotational velocity @xmath102 as @xmath103 , the limiting depth is @xmath104 .",
    "the limiting depth is therefore weakly dependent on inclination , in the sense that low inclined galaxies can be detected to slightly larger distances .",
    "consequently , an survey would in principle preferentially select face - on galaxies . in practice , this effect is negligible , since the expectation for @xmath105 of a randomly oriented sample is close to unity : @xmath106 only the flux limited regime would be hampered by the inclination effect , but most galaxies in this regime are low mass , dwarf galaxies .",
    "the velocity spreads are small for these galaxies , and turbulent motions play an important part at establishing the profile width ( cf . ,",
    "lo , sargent & young 1993 ) .",
    "a potential hazard in radio surveys is the influence of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "rfi can in principle cause false negatives ( miss a significant signal ) in the sample if it affects the spectrum exactly at the frequency of a source , or when a narrow - lined source is mistaken for rfi .",
    "however , the driftscan method that has been used for the ahiss has proven to provide a very good stability for rfi signals ( see briggs et al .",
    "repetitive coverage of the same regions of sky makes the survey immune to rfi and unstable baselines .",
    "this has been demonstrated by the fact that all signals identified in the arecibo survey have been confirmed by the vla follow - up .",
    "the mass function ( himf ) is defined analogously to optical luminosity functions .",
    "the himf @xmath107 gives the total number of galaxies or intergalactic clouds per mpc@xmath108 in the mass interval @xmath109 centered on @xmath110 .",
    "here , we find it convenient in our analysis and figures to plot the himf as the number of galaxies or intergalactic clouds per decade in mass . in order to parameterize the shape of the himf",
    ", we adopt the conventional schechter ( 1976 ) function , @xmath111 with free parameters @xmath112 , the slope of the low - mass end , @xmath113 the characteristic mass that the defines the kink in the function and @xmath114 , a normalization factor .",
    "this function must be integrated over decade bins for comparison with the binned data in the figures .",
    "the classical method ( see e.g. , christensen 1975 , schechter 1976 ) for determining luminosity functions is based on the assumption that galaxies are distributed in a uniform manner .",
    "the luminosity function is determined by dividing the number of galaxies in a bin centered on @xmath115 by @xmath116 , the effective search volume for that particular @xmath115 .",
    "this method is easily applicable to the ahiss .",
    "the search volume can be evaluated with eq.[volume1.eq ] and eq.[volume2.eq ] , using a statistical relation between velocity width and mass .",
    "the advantages of this method are that it is nonparametric and that it is automatically normalized .",
    "the important disadvantage is that it assumes homogeneity and its use might lead to errors in @xmath117 if density fluctuations due to large scale structure occur on distance scales comparable to , or greater than the depth @xmath69 at which @xmath70 can be detected .",
    "a slightly modified form of the ` classical ' method is the @xmath118 method , first used by schmidt ( 1968 ) , which is also applicable to surveys . instead of calculating a mean survey volume for each mass bin , this method consists of summing the reciprocals of the volumes corresponding to the maximum distances to which the objects could be placed and still remain within the sample .",
    "the values of @xmath119 can be calculated directly using eq.[volume1.eq ] and eq.[volume2.eq ] , using now the measured velocity spread instead of the statistical value .",
    "the two procedures give similar results when the number of galaxies per bin is large .",
    "for the less densely populated bins the two procedures can give different results because @xmath119 of a particular galaxy can strongly deviate from the average @xmath87 of the mass bin it falls in .",
    "in section  [ results.sect ] the himf is calculated using schmidt s method . like the classical method , schmidt s method is also vulnerable to errors caused by large scale structure .",

    "we note that in the present analysis the parameterization of the himf in the form of a schechter function is only used to enable comparison with other survey results and results based on the optically selected galaxy population .",
    "the @xmath122 method recovers the shape and amplitude of the himf simultaneously without using a schechter function ( or any other parameterization ) as an assumption about the intrinsic shape of the himf .",

    "this line represents the sensitivity function of the survey to objects of mass @xmath70 , defined as @xmath126 , where @xmath92 is the effective search volume . in the range @xmath127",
    "this function defines an upper limit to the space density of intergalactic clouds without stars .",
    "it also shows that this survey is not capable of measuring the himf directly in the regions @xmath128 and @xmath129 if the extrapolation of the analytical form for @xmath117 holds .",
    "the sensitivity function does allow us to define upper limits in these ranges as indicated by arrows .",
    "the upper limit at @xmath130 is from the complementary survey with the arecibo telescope over the range 19,000 to 28,000 @xmath2 , only sensitive to high mass galaxies ( see sorar ( 1994 ) for details ) .",
    "the slice diagrams in fig  [ slices.fig ] show that the survey strips sample a wide range of large scale structure , as the combined ra range extends nearly 2/3 of the way around the sky . on the other hand , the limited depth of the survey for small masses might cause the low mass end of the himf to be affected by local density fluctuations .",
    "therefore , a major concern in the determination of the mass function following schmidt s method , is whether homogeneity is a fair assumption .",
    "for instance , a local density enhancement would overestimate the number of low mass galaxies or clouds and would give rise to an overestimate of the faint end slope of the mass function .",
    "the biases in the shape of the mass function due to large scale structure can be avoided by making use of a maximum likelihood estimator ( cf . ,",
    "efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 , saunders et al .",
    "if the spatial density distribution of galaxies and intergalactic clouds is given by @xmath131 , then the overall density @xmath132 and the mass function @xmath117 can be separated as @xmath133 .",
    "maximum likelihood estimators can then be used to solve either for @xmath117 without knowledge of @xmath132 or solve for @xmath132 without knowledge of @xmath117 .",
    "although the maximum likelihood method is a powerful procedure for determining optical luminosity functions ( marzke , geller & huchra 1994 , lin et al .",
    "1996 , saunders et al .",
    "1990 ) , we chose not to apply it to the ahiss .",
    "the most important problem is that we have to deal with small number statistics .",
    "especially the faint end slope of the mass function is defined by very few galaxies or clouds per bin . some experimentation with application of the algorithm to small samples such as ours showed that maximum likelihood methods can produce erratic results is these situations .",
    "another complication arises because maximum likelihood methods assume that the shape of the mass function is independent of the space density @xmath132 . in practice",
    ", high mass galaxies will have a higher statistical weight in the determination of @xmath132 since they are simply more numerous in our sample .",
    "it is questionable whether this space density defined by the high mass galaxies is a fair estimate for the galaxies at the faint end side of the mass function , in the region that is dominated by dwarf and lsb galaxies .",
    "although these galaxies are found to follow the same general large scale structures as the normal hsb galaxies , they preferentially avoid the highest density regions ( mo et al .",
    "1994 , taylor 1996 ) . in principle",
    ", the spatial density @xmath134 could be separated into different functions for individual morphological types or different ranges in mass , but the limited number of galaxies in our sample does not allow this differentiation .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of large scale structure we have performed numerical experiments .",
    "these tests consisted of randomly placing artificial galaxies in a volume with weights given by the himf given in eq.[himf.eq ] .",

    "the results are illustrated using the derived himf parameters from fig  [ himfhist.fig ] : @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "a a homogeneous density distribution is assumed .",
    "it is not surprising to see that the input himf and the measured himf agree with high accuracy .",
    "the @xmath139 method should give reliable results in this situation .",
    "it is however apparent that the survey observations have several distance bins that are overdense or underdense compared to the uncertainty band of the ` uniform density ' simulation .",
    "the comparison implies that we may be observing underdensities at @xmath140 mpc and @xmath141 mpc and an overdensity at @xmath142 mpc . to test this hypothesis we constructed catalogs with a density fluctuation as indicated by the top panel in case b.",
    "the precise functional form of this fluctuation is not important , the condition is that is should produce consecutive under and overdensities at @xmath143 30 , 50 and 70 mpc .",
    "the central panel shows that the imposed density fluctuation reproduces the observed redshift distribution satisfactorily .",
    "it is surprising however that if the @xmath144 method is applied to these simulated data the resulting himf is still indistinguishable from the input himf .",
    "in other words , the @xmath139 method appears to be a robust method , and not very sensitive to the effects of large scale structure .",
    "this is even true for case c , where a more severe density fluctuation is imposed , and where the resulting himf is still in good agreement with the input himf",
    ". we can conclude from these simulations that although we see a hint of the effects of large scale structure in our data , the observed deviations from uniformity have no significant influence on our determination of the himf .",
    "the first surveys could only be used to set upper limits to the space density of intergalactic clouds without stars , and did not yield enough detections to allow the determination of the shape of the himf .",
    "shostak ( 1977 ) was to first to define these limits by means of blind driftscan emission and absorption searches in the 21 cm line with the nrao 91 m telescope . due to the relatively poor sensitivity",

    "lo & sargent find four previously uncataloged lsb dwarf galaxies but their upper limits to the space density of unseen objects do not improve shostak s .",
    "fisher & tully used the nrao 91 m telescope to search for invisible galaxies in the m81 group .",
    "their null result allowed them to push the upper limits to the space density 0.6 dex lower those set by shostak .",
    "also krumm & brosch ( 1984 ) find no sources in their driftscan searches of void regions and are only able to define upper limits .",
    "these limits are not very strict since their survey is only sensitive in the redshift range above 5300 @xmath2 , and is consequently only capable of finding masses @xmath148 .",
    "a series of papers by kerr & henning ( 1987 ) and henning ( 1992 , 1995 ) describes blind surveys which consisted of observing a series of pointings along lines of constant declination in the zone of avoidance and at high galactic latitude .",
    "these surveys yielded 39 detections ( of which half were previously unknown ) and were the first to put serious constraints on the shape of the himf . for comparison",
    ", the himf calculated by henning ( 1995 ) is reproduced in fig .",

    "are significantly lower than our measured curve . according to henning s calculations objects with @xmath149",
    "are deficient by a one order of magnitude compared to the ahiss himf .",
    "the presence of the local void in henning s survey could explain a part of this discrepancy , but even if the void is omitted the points are still beneath our himf .",
    "the most reasonable explanation for the discrepancy is that the sensitivity of henning s survey is not well understood , leading to a serious underestimate of the himf .",
    "the most recent determination of the himf is the one by schneider ( 1997 ) who used both the uncorrected arecibo data from sorar s ( 1994 ) survey and the data from spitzak s ( 1996 ) survey with the arecibo telescope .",
    "schneider assessed the completeness limits of the surveys with the use of @xmath150 tests .",
    "he calculated the average value of @xmath150 and scaled that to the correct value of 0.5 by increasing the limiting flux density @xmath151 .",
    "schneider noted the vulnerability of this method to the influence of large scale structure . despite this different approach ,",
    "the resulting himf is in good agreement with our estimate , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ compa.fig ] .",
    "only the low mass end deviates significantly .",
    "the statistics in the bins with @xmath152 are poor , and schneider could not rule out a slope as high as @xmath153 .",
    "the differences in the slopes can be partly explained by the fact that _ uncorrected _ masses are used in schneider s estimate of the himf from sorar s data .",
    "the effect that the flux is underestimated when the arecibo beam misses a galaxy by a certain angle @xmath44 was not taken into account .",
    "the vla masses that are used in our himf are on average 50% higher , leading to a shift of galaxies to higher mass bins . as an alternate approach ,",
    "schneider also applied a maximum likelihood fit to all the signals brighter that @xmath154 .",
    "the resulting himf had a faint end slope @xmath155 .",
    "this result is also drawn in fig .  [ compa.fig ] and is in very good agreement with our function over the whole range in mass .",
    "in addition to making comparisons with surveys that are equally blind as the ahiss , it is also interesting to compare our results with surveys that cover comparable volumes in underdense and overdense regions .",
    "it is noteworthy that the himf determined from hi observations in clusters ( mcmahon 1993 ) , as well as that determined in cosmic voids ( szomoru et al .",
    "1996 ) are both well fit by a schechter function , with approximately the same shape as as our himf .",
    "the scaling @xmath114 , however , differs by a factor of ten or more between these different regions .    since the ahiss crosses the galactic plane twice , and consequently a large fraction of the total survey volume lies in regions which are not complete in optical catalogs , it is difficult to calculate the exact void filling factor of our survey .",
    "if we limit the calculation to the regions where @xmath156 , we estimate that approximately 50% of the survey volume consists of regions where the average galaxy density is less than one third of the cosmic mean , and approximately 10% of the volume consists of structures where the galaxy density takes on more than three times the cosmic mean .",
    "the same percentages are obtained if random slices through the universe are taken .",
    "if voids would be omitted from the survey , the scaling @xmath114 of the himf would increase by a factor of two .",
    "the construction of an himfs from a sample of optically selected galaxies can either be done statistically , by studying optical luminosity functions and the dependence of mass on on optical luminosity , or directly by using 21 cm data of optically selected galaxies .",
    "the first method was used by rb , who reviewed the literature that describes luminosity functions and richness for individual morphological types . combining these data enabled them to construct an himf over three orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "their result is in good agreement with our estimate of the himf in the range of mass where our survey is sensitive .",

    "uncertainties in @xmath70 and velocity width do not influence the search volume in this regime .",

    "( 1993 ) has shown that the gas densities of lsb galaxies are often just below or equal to the critical density for star formation . if the relation between optical surface brightness and gas density extends to still lower surface brightnesses this implies that galaxies that most easily escape detection in optical surveys are also the ones that might be missed in 21 cm surveys .    until recently ,",
    "blind surveys were not able to reach column densities much lower than @xmath186 .",
    "these surveys would therefore still miss low density systems , and would not be capable to set strict constraints on the number density of lsb galaxies .",

    "because we seem to be observing a lower limit to @xmath199 , much higher than our detection limit , it is very unlikely that galaxies with even lower column densities are missed by the ahiss .",
    "theoretical predictions of the ionization of gas layers by the extragalactic uv background ( corbelli & salpeter 1993 , maloney 1993 , charlton , salpeter & linder 1994 ) demonstrate physical mechanisms that can explain the possible non - existence of low column density neutral gas layers .",

    "they define a correction factor @xmath202 which is defined by the corrected flux divided by the measured flux and find a general trend : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is a constant dependent on morphological type .",

    "no correlations are found for morphological types earlier than sa or later than sc , indicating that self absorption is negligible in these types .",
    "higher self absorption in types sb to sc can be explained by the fact that these galaxies generally have the highest surface densities ( cayatte et al .",
    "furthermore , rotation curves of early type spiral galaxies show the strongest deviations from solid body rotation implying large velocity spreads per line of sight , which further decreases self absorption .",
    "mean self absorption factors per morphological type can be obtained by averaging @xmath202 over a random distribution of inclinations .",
    "this yields @xmath205 the mean correction factors then become 1.04 for sa and sab , 1.19 for sb and 1.16 for sbc and sc galaxies .",

    "the correction to @xmath9 due to self absorption will therefore probably not be more than the value of @xmath206 averaged over morphological types sb to sd .",

    "we conclude that the effect on the high mass range will be marginal .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath114 and the value which determines the kink , @xmath113 , will probably increase by no more than 10% .",
    "galaxies that determine the faint end slope @xmath112 are mostly dwarf and lsb galaxies . on the one hand ,",
    "self absorption may be unimportant because the gas density in these galaxies is usually low ( van der hulst 1993 ) and the dust content is presumably low ( mcgaugh 1994 ) which implies scarcity of clumped gas ( haynes & giovanelli 1984 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies often show solid body rotation ( de blok et al .",
    "1996 , swaters 1997 ) which causes a low velocity spread along a line of sight , leading to high fractions of self absorption .",

    "<S> the mass function ( himf ) for galaxies in the local universe is constructed from the results of the arecibo strip survey , a blind extragalactic survey in the 21 cm line . </S>",
    "<S> the survey consists of two strips covering in total @xmath0 square degrees of sky , with a depth of @xmath1  @xmath2 and was optimized to detect column densities of neutral gas @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the survey yielded 66 significant extragalactic signals of which approximately 50% are cataloged galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> no free floating clouds without stars are found . </S>",
    "<S> vla follow - up observations of all signals have been used to obtain better measurements of the positions and fluxes and allow an alternate determination of the achieved survey sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting himf has a shallow faint end slope ( @xmath5 ) , and is consistent with earlier estimates computed for the population of optically selected gas rich galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that there is not a large population of gas rich low luminosity or low surface brightness galaxies that has gone unnoticed by optical surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of large scale structure on the determination of the himf from the arecibo strip survey is tested by numerical experiments and was not found to affect the resulting himf significantly . the cosmological mass density of at the present time determined from the survey , @xmath6 , is in good agreement with earlier estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we determine lower limits to the average column densities @xmath7 of the galaxies detected in the survey and find that none of the galaxies have @xmath8 , although there are no observational selection criteria against finding lower density systems . </S>",
    "<S> eight percent of the signals detected in the original survey originated in groups of galaxies , whose signals chanced to coincide in frequency . </S>"
