    "the second type of plasticity is known as structural plasticity .",
    "structural plasticity deals with anatomical structure of neurons , and connections between neurons .",
    "the anatomical structures of neurons are subject to variation , and new connections between neurons can be established or deleted @xcite in the course of development of neuron net .",
    "structural plasticity as well as synaptic plasticity is a permanent and activity dependent process .",
    "because it is an activity dependent process it can be the basis of learning .",
    "activity - dependent modifications of neural circuits lead to changes in activity pattern of whole network",
    ". the geometrical properties of neurons should be considered in the theoretical investigations of structural plasticity of neural netsworks .",
    "the network must be considered as a system of neurons in three dimensional neuropil where neurons communicate with each other .",
    "the geometrical properties of neurons and the neuropil where neurons are constituent elements of networks .",
    "the neural networks generate activity patterns which depend on the intrinsic state of individual neuron and external influences on the system .",
    "this activity influences structural plasticity process .",
    "an external signal changes the activity pattern and leads to creation of new connections i.e. network will be modified according to external information .    the neurons without connections",
    "can be considered a system of neurons in three dimensional space . at the beginning ,",
    "the neurons interact only by emission of chemicals .",
    "even no connections between neurons exist it may still be considered a system . with time new connections between neurons",
    "appear and the system will possess new properties and neurons can make influence on the activity of each other neurons .    in vivo and in vitro neurons",
    "self - organize into networks @xcite .",
    "mature networks can be considered a result of activity - dependent dynamical wiring process .",
    "single neurons have properties that form the assembly into networks .",
    "calcium plays the most important role in wiring process @xcite .",
    "neuronal activity via voltage - dependent calcium channels provide influx of calcium through membrane .",
    "intracellular calcium activates and regulates different intercellular processes which influences growth cone movement , axon elongation , neurotrophin release , synaptogenesis , among other molecular mechanisms .",
    "the molecular mechanisms of most of these processes remains unclear and are subjects of many experimental studies .",
    "wiring process is controlled by intrinsic neuronal activity and neural activity is caused by sensory experience ( externals signals ) .",
    "external signals regulate neuronal activity and leads formation of the wiring between neurons .",
    "this adaptation leads to different neural activity even under constant sensory input , enabling the building of more complex representation and leading to progressive cognitive development .",
    "three levels of neuronal response to external signals can be considered : ( i ) induced spikes , ( ii ) synaptical plasticity and ( iii ) structural plasticity .",
    "these processes have different time scales namely , spikes  milliseconds , synaptical plasticity  hours , structural plasticity  days . in the present paper",
    "we take into account the first and third levels of consideration . in the future we plan to include in our model the second level .    in this paper",
    "we present a mathematical model of the neural activity , underlying the development of neural networks .",
    "the basis of our diffusion model is the experimental support of physiological and anatomical data .",
    "numerical simulations show the neural network growth , and how neural activity controls this process .",
    "the results may be used for experimental verification of the neural network growth and for conditions of new experiments .",
    "some parameters of our model have no experimental basis ( e.g. dependence of amount of agm released by neurons on activity ) and may needs to be verified in future experiments .",
    "models of axon guidance have been considered in detail by hentschel and van ooyen @xcite .",
    "three types of diffusible molecules have been considered : a chemoattractant released by target cells , a chemoattractant released by the axonal growth cones and chemorepellant released by axonal growth cones .",
    "two cases were considered namely , ( i ) diffusible signals only , and ( ii ) contact interactions with diffusible signals .",
    "it was shown that target - derived chemoattractant controls axon guidance , the axon - derived chemoattractant and chemorepellant control bundling and debundling .",
    "the dynamics of chemicals concentrations are described by standard diffusion equation .",
    "every chemical has its own diffusion constant , the release rate and degradation parameter .",
    "the release rate constants of chemicals has no dependence on the state of the cell which releases them . in the framework of the model the growth cones response to the concentration gradients of chemicals and total response of the growth cone",
    "are the result of two attractive and one repulsive concentration gradient .",
    "our model , in the part concerning agm s diffusion and growth cone movement , is based on the above mentioned models .",
    "for simplicity we consider only one type of chemoattractant .",
    "for description of the movement of growth cone one uses more complicated equations .",
    "the main difference is that , the release of chemoattractant is controlled by activity of the target cells , and the growth rate of the growth cones depends on the activity state of the neuron with growing axon .",
    "our model can be considered as generalization in the point of neuron activity , of the model presented in the @xcite .",
    "some models of activity - dependent neural network development have already been considered .",
    "first of all the model suggested by van ooyen and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the model consists of initially disconnected neurons , modeled as neuritic field , which are organized into a network under influence of their internal activity .",
    "the growth of neurites are connected with ca@xmath0 concentration inside the cell . therefore , the growth of neurites depends on their own level of activity , and the neurons become connected when their fields overlap . according to this model the high level of activity causes neurites to retract , whereas low level allows further outgrowth . from mathematical point of view",
    "they used a system of coupled differential equations for neural activity and connection strength .",
    "they showed , that spatial distribution of the cells can create connectivity patterns in which hysteresis appears and complex periodic behavior takes place @xcite .",
    "the segev with collaborators presented a model that incorporates stationary units representing the cells soma and communicating walkers representing the growth cones .",
    "the dynamics of the walker s internal energy is controlled by the soma , and they migrate in response to chemorepulsive and chemoattractive glues emitted by the soma and communicate with each other and with the soma by means of chemotactic feedback @xcite .",
    "our model is based on axon guidance by extracellular signals released by other neurons .",
    "our consideration is based on the diffusion of the agm .",
    "we already considered this approach before in simple form @xcite with binary neurons and without detail consideration of the process of diffusion . also , the parameters of the model have had no connection with reality and were taken from the mathematical point of view to obtain suitable results .",
    "the main novelty in our approach is that we consider the activity - dependence of the processes underlaying neural network growth in more detail .",
    "axon growth requires the interplay of many processes : producing cytoplasmic and membrane elements , shipping these building blocks to the right compartment and inserting them into the growing axon and coordination of all these processes .    the tips of growing axons equipped by a very specialized structure , called growth cone , which is specialized for generation forward tension on the elongating axon .",
    "growth cone s cytoskeleton consist of microtubules mostly located in central domain of the growth cone ( lamellipodia ) , and actin filaments located in the lamellipodia and finger - like structures ( filopodia ) .",
    "actin monomers in the peripheral domain undergo constitutive filament assembly , elongating the lamellipodia and filopodia and pushing the growth cone membrane in forward direction .",
    "simultaneously actin filaments are dragged back motors into central domain by myosin - like motors where the actin filaments depolymerize .",
    "the advance of peripheral domain of the cone determined by the balance of anterograde polymerization and retrograde retraction of actin . if the balance is shifted toward forward protrusion , the decrease of in retrograde flow of actin filaments is accompanied by microtubule polymerization into the peripheral domain , moving the central domain of the growth cone forward and elongating the axon @xcite .    a great variety of extracellular signals",
    "have been found to regulate axon growth @xcite .",
    "extracellular guidance signals can either attract or repel growth cones , and can operate either at close range or over a distance.in the literature a family of chemicals has been found , which in mammals include nerve growth factor ( ngf ) , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) , neurotrophins , netrins , slits , semaphorins , ephrins @xcite .",
    "diffusible cues are netrins , neurotrophins , ngf , bdnf among others .",
    "the neuronal growth cone uses surface receptors to sense these cues and to transduce guidance information to cellular machinery that mediates growth and turning responses .",
    "these guidance factors we will call axon guidance molecules ( agm ) .",
    "recent studies have shown that electrical activity is required for growing axons to reach their appropriate target area @xcite . in neurons in culture ,",
    "the changes in growth cone motility after electrical stimulation are accompanied by an influx of calcium through voltage - sensitive calcium channels .",
    "the effects of electrical activity and increases in intracellular calcium concentration on growth cone morphology are not the same for all neurons .",
    "some growth cones collapse , some show greater motility and others do not respond at all , depending on the type of neuron , the type of neurite ( axon versus dendrite ) and environmental factors @xcite .",
    "it has been found that there are several different signals and signal transduction mechanisms that ultimately result in alterations of the cytoskeletal structure and growth cone motility .",
    "modern experimental investigations show that essential role in controlling growth cone guidance are ca@xmath0 signals .",
    "the ca@xmath0 concentration in growth cones is controlled by various channels , pumps and buffers .",
    "guidance cues causes the opening of plasma membrane calcium channels .",
    "one of the best studied plasma membrane channel types on growth cones is voltage - operated calcium channels .",
    "guidance of axons to their targets probably involves at least three ca@xmath0  dependent effects on motility in particular , growth promotion , growth inhibition or collapse , and directional steering ( turning ) .",
    "global ca@xmath0 signals can regulate membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal elements to control elongation , whereas localized ca@xmath0 signals can cause asymmetric activation of downstream effector proteins to steer the growth cone .",
    "a small ca@xmath0 gradient produced by modest ca@xmath0 influx or release induces repulsion , whereas a larger ca@xmath0 gradient produced by greater ca@xmath0 influx in combination with release induces attractive turning @xcite .",
    "a set of experimental results leads to `` ca@xmath0 set - point '' hypothesis : normal growth cone motility depends on an optimal range of [ ca@xmath0 ] and neurite growth stops above or below this optimal range @xcite . therefore , ca@xmath0 regulation of growth cone motility depends on both the spatio - temporal patterns of ca@xmath0 signals and the internal state of the neuron , which is modulated by other signals received by the neuron .",
    "thus , a rise in [ ca@xmath0 ] in the growth cone activates numerous target proteins ( cam , camkii , myosin , calpain , calcineurin etc . ) and cellular machinery which regulates actin and microtubule dynamics to provide the growth cone extension and steering @xcite .",
    "when a growth cone guided by agm reaches an appropriate target cell , the synaptogenesis and synapse refinement processes start .",
    "synapse formation is controlled by dynamic interactions between various genes and their encoded proteins and occurs throughout development to generate synapse specificity @xcite .",
    "the modern version of dale s principle suggests that all of a particular neuron s terminals release the same set of neurotransmitters @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that a neuron can store and presumably release the different sets of transmitters from individual axon endings @xcite .",
    "the neurotransmitter choice of the neurons depends on programmed and environmental factors , and this process is neither limited by a critical period nor restricted by their insertion in a network @xcite .",
    "calcium transient patterns plays a key role in the differentiation of neural precursor cells , and their frequency may specify neuronal morphology and acquisition of neurotransmitter phenotype @xcite .",
    "neuronal activity also plays a main role in the neuronal connection establishment @xcite- @xcite and refinement @xcite processes .",
    "the electrical activity of neurons can regulate the choice of neurotransmitter in cultured neurons through calcium influx and can differentially affect the regulation of transmitter expression @xcite .",
    "certain neurons choose the neurotransmitter which they use in an activity - dependent manner , and different trophic factors are involved in this phenotype differentiation during development .",
    "regulation of transmitter expression occurs in a homeostatic manner .",
    "suppression of activity leads to an increased number of neurons expressing excitatory transmitters and a decrease number of neurons expressing inhibitory transmitters and vice verse @xcite .",
    "based on the above discussion we assume that each neuron s axon can release different neurotransmitters and can establish different types of synaptic connections ( inhibitory or excitatory ) . the type of synapse can be determined by state of presynaptic or / and postsynaptic neuron . for simplification we assumed that the type of a synaptic connection between cells depends on the state of postsynaptic cell at synaptogenesis process .",
    "release of some neurotrophic factors can be triggered by external stimulation and neuron s electrical activity @xcite .",
    "the activity dependent release of agm s is a key assumption in our model .",
    "we doubt there is complete proof of activity dependent agm s release and we consider this point a an hypothesis .",
    "let us proceed to description of the model adopted here .",
    "the concentration of agm , @xmath2 , at point @xmath3 in the moment @xmath4 released by the @xmath5-th neuron at point @xmath6 can be found as the solution of the equation @xmath7 here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are agm diffusion and degradation coefficients in the intracellular medium respectively .",
    "the source @xmath10 is amount of the agm per unit time .",
    "it is well - known that the solution of this equation has the following form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is initial distribution of the concentration , @xmath13 is dimension of the problem and the the green function has standard gaussian form @xmath14 we suppose that in the initial time there is no agm and the process is managed by the source @xmath15 which is concentrated at the @xmath5-th neuron .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 describes amount of agm released per unit second .",
    "this quantity means the amount of agm per unit time .",

    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we take the activity @xmath17 is the subject for the equation @xcite @xmath20 where the functional @xmath21 has step form @xmath22 with step function @xmath23 and @xmath24 is amount of neurons . the matrix @xmath25 with elements",
    "@xmath26 describes the influence the @xmath9-th neuron to @xmath5-th neuron ; @xmath27 means excitatory and @xmath28 inhibitory connections , for @xmath29 there is no influence .",
    "the functions @xmath30 describe the external sources which excites @xmath5-th neuron .",
    "now we define the vector @xmath31 which describes the tip of the axon which started to grow from @xmath5-th neuron .",
    "it is subject for equation @xmath32 where functional @xmath33 has the form of the step function , too : @xmath34 the functional @xmath35 , in fact , is smooth function of activity @xmath36 . in our model",
    "we adopt the simplest form of this functional as a step - function by using the threshold parameter .",
    "it means that the axon is quiescent if the activity of its neuron is greater then some threshold value @xmath37 .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 is a coefficient describing axon s sensitivity and motility .    at the initial moment we set matrix @xmath39 which means no connections between neurons .",
    "then we solve the above equations ( [ eqaxon ] ) , ( [ eqactiv ] ) , ( [ eqconc ] ) assuming that some neurons are exited by external force that is assuming that some of @xmath40 are not zero .",
    "we obtain position @xmath41 of the axon s tip at the moment @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5-th axon makes connection with @xmath9-th neuron we set @xmath42 .",
    "in this section we present the result of the numerical simulation of the model considered above .",
    "we simulate two ( @xmath43 neurons ) and three ( @xmath44 neurons ) dimensional realizations of the model . for simplicity",
    "we consider the network of neurons in form of the lattice with increment ( distance between neurons ) @xmath45 .",
    "each neuron has single growth cone , which we consider as its axon .",
    "initially all growth cones are located near its soma , and all synaptic weights are equal to zero ( @xmath46 @xmath47 ) , which means no connections between neurons .",
    "the system of differential equations ( [ eqaxon ] ) , ( [ eqactiv ] ) , ( [ eqconc ] ) were integrated simultaneously by the euler method .",

    "the degradation coefficient @xmath9 may be found , in principal , from specific experiments .",
    "unfortunately , there is no information about this parameter and we put @xmath53 to be in agreement with network growth .",
    "this parameter regulates the rate of the axon s growth . the greater @xmath9 the smaller rate of axon s growth .",
    "there is another threshold parameter of activity which defines sort of connections : @xmath54 or @xmath55 . for homeostasis",
