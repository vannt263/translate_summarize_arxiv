    "recent advances in studying the world - volume theory of m2-branes @xcite have allowed new perspectives on the ads / cft correspondence . indeed , the three - dimensional theory on the m2-branes is now understood as an ordinary gauge theory of chern - simons ( cs ) type @xcite .",
    "the investigation of ads@xmath3/cft@xmath4 subsequently took flight , ever augmenting our arsenal of dual pairs of theories .",
    "one strand of development has been the extension of the elaborate structure of the ads@xmath5/cft@xmath3 situation wherein the d3-brane world - volume gauge theory and the corresponding calabi - yau cone over sasaki - einstein 5-folds have been probed in great detail over the past decade",
    ". of particular interest had been the cases where the calabi - yau threefold admits toric description . there , a rich tapestry , enabled by the abundant techniques of toric geometry , had been woven over such themes as toric duality @xcite , dimer models and brane tilings @xcite .    along this vein , the parallel story for m2-branes probing toric calabi - yau 4-fold singularities met with rapid progress @xcite , addressing such issues as tiling or its 3-dimensional counter - part of crystal models , toric duality , as well as partition functions in the light of the plethystic programme @xcite etc .",
    "thus inspired , especially by the fortitude to attack the general singularity @xcite , it is expedient for us to take a synthetic approach .",
    "the space of toric singularities of calabi - yau 4-folds is largely unchartered ; nevertheless , we can gradually and systematically list , starting from the simplest imaginable , the possible @xmath6-dimensional quiver chern - simons theories .",
    "these theories are , of course , infinite in number ; however , we will see how the number of nodes in the quiver and the number of terms in the superpotential can be used as order parametres to begin a classification . even at low numbers",
    ", we will encounter many highly non - trivial theories .",
    "furthermore , we will establish generating functions which counts the number of inequivalent theories at each level of our enumeration .",
    "remarkably , we can geometrically interpret these functions .",
    "thus , let us we embark on a journey through the complex _ terra incognita _ of new graphs and associated superpotentials , guided by our experience with the techniques of @xmath7-dimensional @xmath8 gauge theory , _ mutatis mutandis _ , and slowly probe the dual pairs of toric geometries and cs theories .",
    "a wealth of interesting properties will be encountered .",
    "our taxonomic study is organised as follows .",
    "we begin , in section [ s : mcs ] , with a brief review of the computation of the moduli space of quiver chern - simons theories in @xmath6-dimensions , culminating in an algorithmic flow - chart which generalises ( and encompasses ) the `` forward - algorithm '' of @xcite to the present case .",
    "next , in section [ s : tax ] , we begin our systematic investigation of what toric chern - simons quiver theories can exist .",
    "we start with two terms in the superpotential satisfying the toric condition and exhaustively present what possibilities could arise , using the number of nodes @xmath9 and the number of fields @xmath10 as order parametres .",
    "we then explicitly show how the moduli spaces of these theories are families of toric calabi - yau 4-folds , indexed by the chern - simons levels .",
    "we find a new manifestation of toric duality . in section [ s : dimer ]",
    ", we show how all these theories admit a dimer - model , or periodic - planar - tiling description , contrary to what one would naively expect . finally ,",
    "stepping back to have a bird s eye view , we find a generating function in section [ s : count ] which counts all the theories encountered . we conclude with prospect in section [ s : conc ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly outline the computation of moduli space of the theories of our interest : @xmath6-dimensional quiver chern - simons theories with @xmath11 supersymmetry .",
    "we point out that henceforth we are interested in the classical mesonic moduli space , which we will denote as @xmath12 .",
    "the theories are with four supersymmetries and the gauge groups have no kinetic terms but instead have cs terms , moreover , they have product gauge groups together with bifundamental and adjoint matter . the computation of @xmath12 is a direct generalisation of the so - called `` * forward algorithm * '' for @xmath7-dimensional @xmath8 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "let the quiver cs theory have gauge group consisting of @xmath9 factors , and a total of @xmath10 fields , we then have the action , written in @xmath11 superspace notation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 indexes the factors in the gauge group , @xmath15 are the superfields accordingly charged , @xmath16 are the gauge multiplets , @xmath17 is the superspace derivative , @xmath18 is the superpotential and @xmath19 are the chern - simons levels which are integers ; an overall trace is implicit since all the fields are matrix - valued .",
    "we take the following two constraints on the cs levels , the reader is referred to @xcite for details : @xmath20 the classical mesonic moduli space @xmath12 is determined by the following equations @xmath21 & = &   4k_a\\sigma_a \\\\ \\label{df } \\sigma_a x_{ab } - x_{ab } \\sigma_b & = & 0 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the scalar component of @xmath16 . indeed , this is in analogy to the f - term and d - term equations of @xmath8 gauge theories in @xmath7-dimensions , with the last equation being a new addition .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case when @xmath12 is a toric variety where the forward algorithm conveniently uses the combinatorial power of lattice geometry and toric cones @xcite .",
    "this is the abelian case where the gauge group is simply @xmath23 .",
    "physically , @xmath12 is a toric calabi - yau 4-fold transverse to an m2-brane on whose world - volume lives the @xmath6-dimensional cs theory . for a stack of @xmath24 parallel , coincident m - branes ,",
    "the moduli space is the @xmath24-th symmetrised product of ( or more precisely the @xmath24-th hilbert scheme of points on ) the 4-fold @xcite .    in this abelian ,",
    "toric case then , the third equation of ( [ df ] ) sets all @xmath22 to a single field , say @xmath25 , on the coherent component of the moduli space .",
    "the second equation causes the d - terms to have fi - parametres @xmath26 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath12 is a symplectic quotient of the space of solutions to the f - terms prescribed by the first equation modulo the gauge conditions prescribed by the d - terms . because of the condition that all @xmath19 sum to 0 imposed in ( [ k - con ] ) there is an overall @xmath27 ( corresponding to the center of mass motion of the m2-brane ) which can be factored out .",
    "furthermore , there is another @xmath27 which can be factored .",
    "this is because the presence of cs couplings induces fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) parameters on the space of d - terms . in a generic @xmath7-dimensional theory",
    "all these fi parameters are arbitrary , but here they are all aligned along a line which is parameterized by @xmath25 and has a direction set by the cs integers .",
    "this picks out a very specific baryonic direction out of all possible directions which are present in @xmath7-dimensions .",
    "this direction becomes mesonic in @xmath6-dimensions and fibers over the calabi - yau 3-fold to give a total space as a calabi - yau 4-fold .",
    "thus , in all , there is a net of @xmath28 d - terms .",
    "the space of solutions of the f - terms is itself a toric variety , of dimension @xmath29 , this is the so - called `` * master space * '' @xmath30 , studied in detail in @xcite . indeed , the @xmath31 d - terms are all the directions which remain baryonic in @xmath6-dimensions and give rise to the master space baryonic directions for a given lagrangian with @xmath9 gauge groups .",
    "this does not imply that all possible baryonic directions of the particular cy4 are given by these @xmath31 directions .",
    "it only provides a lower bound .",
    "there are at least @xmath31 such baryonic directions and a different formulation may give more than this number .",
    "such a situation is evident from the study of models presented in @xcite . ] .",
    "since we are interested in the mesonic moduli space , we impose gauge invariance with respect to all of them . in summary , @xmath32 where we have marked the complex dimensions explicitly as subscripts .",
    "the @xmath31 fi - parametres are shown in @xcite to be in the integer kernel of the matrix @xmath33    to proceed we now recall the essential features in the computation of the 3 + 1 dimensional mesonic moduli space of complex dimension 3 .",
    "computationally , the charges of the fields are given by the so - called * incidence matrix * of the quiver ; this is a @xmath34 matrix .",
    "each column of this matrix representation of the quiver consists of two possible choices ( 1 ) a single pair @xmath35 and @xmath36 denoting an arrow beginning and ending at the appropriate node and zero elsewhere , or ( 2 ) an entire column of zeros , denoting an adjoint field charged only under one single node .",
    "the incidence matrix is customarily denoted as @xmath37 and specifies the d - terms , i.e. , the @xmath27 toric actions .",
    "the crucial property of @xmath37 is that each of its columns sums to 0 ( since each column corresponds to one arrow that necessarily has one head and one tail . ) and that each of its rows also sums to 0 ( this ultimately ensures that the moduli space be calabi - yau ) .",
    "we emphasise the ambiguity for an adjoint : we do not know under which precise node it is charged ; from the point of view of the incidence matrix , there is no way to distinguish .",
    "we will see later how using information from the superpotential one may overcome this ambiguity .    of course , one row of @xmath37 is redundant because of the summation rule , we delete it and customarily call the result @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the f - terms can be solved in terms of a matrix @xmath39 , whose dual cone we call @xmath40 . from these",
    "we can extract so - called @xmath41 and @xmath42 matrices .",
    "we refer the reader to section 2 of @xcite for the details .",
    "schematically we can summarise the procedure of the `` forward algorithm '' , taken from _ cit .",
    "as follows : @xmath43^t   &    & \\longrightarrow    & & ( q_t)_{(c-3 ) \\times c } = \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } ( vu)_{(g-1)\\times c } \\\\",
    "q_{(c - g-2 ) \\times c } \\\\   \\end{array } \\right ) & \\end{array}\\ ] ] we have marked the dimensions of each matrix for clarity .",
    "note that @xmath44 is the number of perfect matching in the dimer model @xcite description of the theory to which we shall later turn .",
    "the key point is that we can combine the matter content ( specified by the incidence matrix ) and the superpotential ( specified by the @xmath39-matrix ) into a single charge matrix @xmath45 ; its kernel , @xmath46 , of dimension @xmath47 , encodes the toric diagram of the calabi - yau threefold moduli space .",
    "refreshed with this recollection let us make one more step before getting back to the main case of interest .",
    "having outlined the computational procedure , let us now proceed with a systematic study of examples .",
    "ideally , one would wish for a classification of all possible theories , their quiver diagrams , interactions and subsequent geometries .",
    "this is a daunting task of organising an infinite number of models .",
    "nevertheless , we can proceed cautiously and modestly : let us start with theories with a single pair of black - white nodes in the dimer picture . these correspond to cases where the superpotential vanishes for a single brane ; this is because the so - called * toric condition * @xcite requires that each field appears exactly twice with opposite signs . in terms of the dimer model @xcite",
    ", this condition is what gives rise to the bi - partite nature of the tiling .",
    "of course , for multiple branes , because the fields become matrix - valued and do not commute necessarily , the superpotential may no longer vanish .",
    "this is familiar to us .",
    "for example , in the 3 + 1 dimensional gauge theory for the conifold 3-fold singularity there is a quartic superpotential which vanishes for a single brane .",
    "we will encounter this situation in detail below .",
    "hence , with a single m2 brane , and with only two terms therein , the superpotential actually vanishes , subsequently , the master space is freely generated by the @xmath10 fields and is simply @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the matter content completely specifies the 4-fold singularity .",
    "the symplectic quotient ( [ symp ] ) and the traditional approach both become relatively simple in this case .",
    "in fact , in ( [ gt ] ) , @xmath58 and the perfect matching matrix @xmath54 is just the identity matrix .",
    "the @xmath53 matrix for the f - terms are not present and we have that : @xmath59 where @xmath60 means @xmath12 has the toric diagram given by @xmath46 of dimensions @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , from ( [ symp ] ) , we see that @xmath62 ; let us hence use @xmath10 as a single order parametre and proceed gradually .",
    "we initiate with the case of two nodes , i.e. , @xmath63 . for each incremental value of @xmath10",
    ", we classify all @xmath37-matrices satisfying the constraints which define the incidence matrix .",
    "indeed , in ( [ symp2 ] ) , @xmath64 has dimensions @xmath65 and its kernel @xmath46 will have columns of length 4 , as is required for a toric diagram of a 4-fold .    in summary , our classification scheme for 2 terms in the superpotential proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "fix @xmath9 , the number of nodes in the quiver .",
    "this also fixes the number of arrows as @xmath62 ; 2 .",
    "find all @xmath66 matrices which are incidence matrices , i.e. , ( a ) each column is one of only zeros ( adjoint ) or consists of a single pair of @xmath35 and @xmath36 and zero otherwise ( bi - fundamental ) , ( b ) each row sums to 0 ( calabi - yau condition ) ; 3 .   identify all loops ( gauge invariant operators ) in the quiver drawn from each incidence matrix and construct possible 2-term superpotentials satisfying ( a ) the toric condition , i.e. , each bi - fundamental field occurs exactly twice and with opposite sign and ( b ) for a single brane when all the fields reduce from matrix - valued to complex numbers , the 2 terms conspire to cancel .",
    "how do we attack step 2 , the most computationally intense one ?",
    "luckily , the algorithms for such a matrix - partitioning problem were implemented in @xcite and we can thus happily proceed with presenting the solutions .",

    "the fact that we have cs constraints , of course , modifies the moduli space from the 3-dimensional conifold to a cy 4-fold .    in model",
    "( 2 ) , there are 2 adjoint fields and 2 bi - fundamentals . where shall we place the 2 non - bi - fundamental fields in model ( 2 ) ?",
    "we can be guided by promoting to @xmath77 number of branes .",

    "calling the two bi - fundamentals @xmath78 and @xmath79 , for both adjoints on the same node , say node 2 without loss of generality , we have 2 gauge invariant terms : @xmath80 and @xmath81 . on the other hand , for one adjoint on each node we have only one possible invariant : @xmath82 ; this is because we need to be careful in matrix composition when we go about the loops in the quiver to construct the gauge invariants .",

    "the two full models are drawn in figure  [ f : e=4full ] .",

    "@xmath87 and there is no symplectic action .",
    "thus the moduli space is simply the master space , viz . , @xmath88 .",
    "the toric diagram is merely 4 corners of a tetrahedron .",
    "we are assured by the fact that these two models have appeared in the literature , model ( 1 ) , in @xcite and model ( 2 ) , in @xcite , in each case from different lines of reasoning .",
    "here we have arrived at these from yet another viewpoint  a systematic scan of theories .",
    "it is perhaps important to emphasize that model ( 2 ) is not considered to be a consistent model in 3 + 1 dimensions even though it does admit a two dimensional tiling @xcite ( here consistent is taken to mean that it leads to a 3 + 1 dimensional scft under the rg flow to the ir , with a known ads dual ) .",
    "the essential feature of model ( 2 ) is node 2 which has 1 flavor ( or taking the sqcd conventions of the number of flavors @xmath89 equal to the number of colors ) .",
    "henceforth we shall call such nodes as `` * one - flavored nodes * '' .",
    "indeed it is a standard lore that such theories develop a scale and confine in 3 + 1 dimensions , thus not leading to scft . on the other hand , such theories in 2 + 1 dimensions",
    "do not necessarily develop a scale @xcite and can perfectly lead to a non - trivial scft under the rg flow .",
    "once we allow for theories with one - flavored nodes , a whole space of opportunities reveals itself and a zoo of new scft s in 2 + 1 dimensions becomes available .",

    "clearly there are infinitely many such cases and it is interesting to study the systematics of this phenomenon .",
    "it is now well - established that the most convenient and elegant way of encoding the @xmath7-dimensional quiver gauge theory of d3-branes probing toric calabi - yau threefold singularities is through the formalism of dimer models , or , equivalently , brane - tilings @xcite .",
    "the afore - mentioned `` toric condition '' @xcite of the superpotential is naturally interpreted as the bi - partite ( 2-colour ) property of the tiling while the calabi - yau condition of the threefold , which compels the toric diagram to be planar , gives the inherent structure of periodic tiling of the 2-dimensional plane .",
    "one question which has emerged is how this would generalise to toric varieties of higher dimension .",
    "indeed , proposals have been made which suggest that a 3-dimensional analogue of the dimer , a so - named `` crystal model '' , should encode the toric calabi - yau 4-fold case @xcite .",
    "is this so for the 4-folds we have encountered in our investigation ?",
    "surprisingly , we find all our above cs theories to afford 2-dimensional tilings , rather than the naively expected crystals which tile 3-dimensions .",
    "let us recall that for the @xmath7-dimensional gauge theories , an important relation exists @xcite : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the number of terms in the superpotential , while @xmath10 and @xmath9 , as above , are the number of fields and gauge group factors .",

    "these are all models which have a single base node , viz . , a single reference node whence loops depart and thence return .",
    "let us consider a chain of closed paths beginning and ending on this same node ( corresponding to a possibly multi - trace gauge invariant operator ) and denote it by a sequence of non - negative integers each entry of which encodes the length of one loop . clearly , this sequence is unordered .",
    "for example , for the simple quiver which has a single node with 3 self - loops attached ( incidentally , this is the quiver of the @xmath137 super - yang - mills theory for d3-branes in flat @xmath138 paradigmatic in the first ads / cft pair ) , we would denote it as 000 , drawn in figure  [ f : c3 ] .",

    "this is model ( 2 ) of figure  [ f : e=4full ] , which has 2 loops of length 0 and 1 loop of length 1 .",
    "note that by length here we mean the number of different nodes traversed before returning .",
    "similarly , 011 and 002 correspond to models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of figure  [ f : e=5full ] respectively .",
    "likewise , we retrieve the 3 aforementioned models for @xmath126 fields corresponding to 111 , 012 and 003 .",
    "the systematics is thus clear . for @xmath10 fields and @xmath139 nodes , we are counting graphs which are in correspondence with unordered partitioning of @xmath140 into 3 parts of non - negative integers .",
    "this is a standard problem , whose solution is simply @xmath141 this function was indeed encountered in @xcite as the generating function for 1 adjoint field with @xmath142 d3 branes .",
    "the above is the generating function such that the coefficient in front of @xmath143 gives the number of quivers of 1 base node with @xmath9 nodes .",
    "these are all quivers with 3 primitive loops .",
    "having addressed one family of quivers transcending across @xmath10 , the family with a single base node , let us move onto 2 base nodes , say 1 and 2 .",
    "now , it is more convenient to count by open paths : we let @xmath144 denote a configuration which has open paths of length @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 respectively starting at node 1 , ending at node 2 , starting at node 2 and ending at node 1 . again , by length we mean distance away from the base pair .",
    "these are all quivers with 4 primitive paths between the 2 base nodes .",
    "specifically , 0000 would correspond to model ( 1 ) of figure  [ f : e=4full ] .",
    "next , taking the base pair to be nodes 3 and 1 , 0001 would denote model ( 1 ) of figure  [ f : e=5full ] . moving on to 4 nodes and 6 fields",
    ", we see that 0002 , 0011 and 0101 denote respectively models ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) of figure  [ f : e=6full ] when taking nodes 4 and 1 and the base pair .",
    "this is analogous to the above , but is the unordered partitioning of @xmath31 into 4 non - negative integers with the extra complication that we must respect the di - hedral symmetry .",
    "specifically , the transpositions @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 generate a dihedral group of order 8 .",
    "orbits under these 8 elements must be quotiented out .",
    "the generating function for this also admits a standard solution by method of molien series @xcite for the dihedral group , in a 4-dimensional representation acting on our 4-vector : @xmath152 here , the coefficient of @xmath153 is the number of models with @xmath154 nodes .    what about triplets or more of base nodes ?",
    "note that our above two have already exhausted all the quivers we have so far explicitly constructed .",
    "could there be more families which one might encounter at higher @xmath10 ?",
    "we now argue that we shall , in fact , not .",
    "first , let us recall that our counting procedure above of course does not include any disconnected graphs and moreover excludes shapes such as model ( 8) of figure  [ f : e=6disconnect ] .",
    "this is a 3-base - node example ; however , we have explicitly shown that the superpotential vanished .",
    "indeed , the cases of base nodes being one or two precisely permitted us to write a commutation relation allowing for the two terms in the superpotential : the case of the 1-base - node achieved with the adjoint and the case of the 2-base - node , with the pair of bi - fundamentals between them .",
    "any other case must either be reducible to these two situations or have vanishing superpotential .",
    "indeed , we can use an additional symmetry to restrict the possible models . consider the number of flavours @xmath155 for a given node @xmath68 : this is either an incoming - outgoing pair of arrows or an adjoint .",
    "the vector @xmath155 for @xmath156 is an additional order parameter . from our examples",
    ", we see that it is 1 for most nodes .",
    "this is the one - flavoured node we discussed earlier .",
    "however , it must be at least 1 for every node since we are not counting disconnected quivers and it must never exceed 3 since there are only @xmath118 number of arrows in total . clearly , the sum of @xmath155 over @xmath68 is equal to @xmath118 . therefore , there are only 2 possibilities for the components of the vector : ( a ) @xmath140 of them being 1 and a single 3 or ( b ) @xmath31 of them being 1 and 2 of them being 2 .    subsequently , this places a significant restriction on the total number of adjoints . since each node must have at least one bi - fundamental , case ( a )",
    "could have up to 2 adjoints on the last node and case ( b ) could have up to a single adjoint on the last two nodes .",
    "hence , in total there could really only be 0 , 1 or 2 adjoints .",
    "now , we see that any node which has no adjoint and only an incoming / outgoing pair of arrows is a descendent of a simpler configuration : namely replace this node , together with its 2 attached arrows , with a single arrow between the 2 nodes from which the said node emanates .",
    "therefore , we need only consider the parent quivers of ( a ) and ( b ) , viz . , a single node with flavour number 3 or two nodes each with flavour number 2 , respectively .",
    "the former is 000 .",
    "the latter has two possibilities : 0000 and a quiver which looks like @xmath157 ; we can easily show that the latter admits no non - vanishing 2-term superpotential . indeed ,",
    "model ( 8) of figure  [ f : e=6disconnect ] discussed above is a descendent thereof and also needs to be eliminated .    in summary",
    ", we only need to consider descendents of the 3-vector 000 and the 4-vector 0000 and no quivers with more than 2 base nodes survive .",
    "hence , @xmath158 and @xmath159 together exhaust all counting . furthermore ,",
    "noticing the shift in power of @xmath159 with respect to @xmath158 , we conclude that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the number of theories of our interest , i.e. , all non - trivial , connected models with 2 terms in a non - vanishing superpotential and @xmath154 nodes , is counted by the coefficient of @xmath160 in the expansion of the generating function _ @xmath161 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      the forms of @xmath158 and @xmath159 are perhaps familiar to the astute reader .",
    "the first , is the hilbert series ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for the weighted projective plane @xmath162}$ ] ( or , alternatively the quotient @xmath163 of the symmetric group on 3 objects ) , and the second , that of the 4-fold quotient singularity @xmath164 , i.e. , the orbifold of @xmath88 by the dihedral group of order 8 ( cf . @xcite for discrete subgroups of @xmath165 ) .",
    "it is quite elegant that these two geometrical spaces should encode the entire space of quivers of our type .",
    "in fact , quivers of the first family , the single - base - node type , obey a simple rule of composition , reflecting the fact that there is an underlying commutative algebra which is freely generated : the zero element is the self - adjoining loop , 1 is the quiver with 2 nodes and a pair of bi - fundamentals in opposite directions between them , and thus generalising to @xmath166 , which is the quiver that is an @xmath166-gon with bi - fundamentals cyclically going around once .",
    "we can create a quiver by selecting any 3 from this list and composition is by pasting the three at a chosen common node : @xmath167 in terms of the 3-vector of integers , we can also see this composition .",
    "for example , 001 + 011 = 012 refers to the following pasting of quivers @xmath168 indeed , we have drawn the result in a suggestive form , so as to indicate that such a composition corresponds to the insertion of nodes .",
    "specifically , adding @xmath169 signifies inserting , after choosing an absolute ordering of the loops , @xmath145 , @xmath148 and @xmath170 nodes into the loops .",
    "in this fashion , we readily see that the quivers @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 generate , by this insertion procedure , all quivers with one base node .",
    "thus , we have an algebra freely generated by the three elements : @xmath174    the second family is a little more involved",
    ". we can define the 0 element as a node with an out - going arrow , 1 as a node with an incoming and an out - going arrow , etc .",
    ": @xmath175 composition is by again pasting , though this time we must first paste to create a pair of base nodes , unto which we may then attach the open arrows of the element @xmath166 .",
    "finally , we must eliminate the redundancies of quivers which obey dihedral symmetry . in terms of the 4-vector",
    ", we now have an algebra generated by 5 elements , 0001 , 0011 , 0101 , 0111 and 1111 : @xmath176 obeying a single relation .",
    "we have thus uncovered an algebraic structure on the space of cs quivers with 2-term superpotentials .",
    "this is expected to persist to higher number of terms and indeed to the space of all quivers ; we have thus found an underlying algebraic variety for the set of chern - simons quivers .",
    "we remark also that taking the plethystic logarithm @xcite of the total @xmath177 reveals that it is a non - terminating series suggesting that the algebraic variety is not a complete intersection .",
    "it is in the form of a set union of the two orbifolds , though there is a degree shift on the second .",
    "in this paper we have started a taxonomic study of quiver chern - simons theories in @xmath6-dimensions .",
    "in particular , we study the theories arising from m2-branes probing toric calabi - yau 4-fold singularities .",
    "our purpose is not to merely provide a catalogue of such theories since there are clearly infinite families thereof , but to study the space of these theories from both a synthetic and an analytic approach , and to uncover interesting physical phenomena as well as mathematical structure .",
    "some of the techniques and concepts can indeed be generalised to quiver theories in arbitrary dimension and with any supersymmetry .",
    "we have first presented , in flow - chart ( [ gt ] ) , a succinct way of a `` forward algorithm '' which takes the quiver and superpotential data as input and the moduli space as an output : the former as a pair of matrices , respectively the incidence and the perfect matching matrices , and the latter , as a matrix representing the integer coordinates of the toric diagram of the calabi - yau 4-fold .",
    "the intermediate computations involve nothing more than matrix multiplications and finding kernels .",
    "indeed , this generalises and significantly improves on the forward - algorithm of the case of @xmath7-dimensional gauge theories of @xcite : we only need to insert a @xmath48-matrix of the chern - simons levels and have obviated the need for finding dual cones .",
    "thus armed , we have commenced the classification of all quiver chern - simons theories .",
    "listing the quivers is matter of combinatorics and for simplicity we have taken the superpotential to have two terms .",
    "it is clearly a pressing problem what happens at an arbitrary number @xmath133 of terms , this we shall leave to forth - coming work .",
    "subsequently our order parametre becomes @xmath9 , the number of nodes and @xmath10 , the number of arrows , is equal to @xmath178 since the master space here is @xmath179 .",
    "in general , we should have 3 order parametres @xmath180 .",
    "we exhaustively list the first members at @xmath181 and find many non - trivial theories , including and extending beyond what has so far emerged in the literature .",
    "because of our forward algorithm , we can readily determine the toric calabi - yau 4-fold moduli spaces for all the theories presented .",
    "these exhibit as many toric varieties , each of which is an infinite family , indexed by the integer chern - simons levels .",
    "remarkably we have once more encountered the phenomenon of `` toric duality '' first noted in @xcite for @xmath7-dimensional gauge theories .",
    "now , it has manifested in perhaps some more striking guises : we find not only theories with the same number of nodes but also those with different number of nodes , fields , as well as chern - simons levels , to flow to the same ir moduli space as toric calabi - yau 4-folds .",
    "it is certainly of importance to study what is precisely happening in the field theory of such pairs .",
    "building upon our host of examples , we have stepped back for a panoramic view of all our theories : connected quiver chern - simons with 2-term toric superpotentials . though the graphs seem unwieldy and growth rapidly in number as we increase the number of nodes , we have found a generating function ( [ gen ] ) which counts the number of inequivalent theories given the number of nodes .",
    "remarkably , this generating function splits conveniently into 2 pieces , each of which is the hilbert series of a precise algebraic variety : the non - abelian quotient space @xmath163 by the symmetric group on 3 objects of order 6 and the abelian quotient @xmath164 by the ordinary dihedral group of order 8 ( i.e. , the symmetry group of the square ) .",
    "could we package the case with arbitrary @xmath182 into a convenient tri - variate generating function and would the result have an interpretation as a hilbert series , whereby suggesting that the space of quiver theories is itself some algebraic variety ? in answering this and many questions raised we are presently engaged .",
    "indeed , we have only tread upon the fringe of a vast and fertile land , into her bountiful bosom we must onwardly march .",
