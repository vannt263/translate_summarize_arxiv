    "thermal and statistical models of hadron production @xcite have become the standard tools to analyze mean multiplicities of the particles produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "they have explained successfully the ags @xcite , sps @xcite , and rhic @xcite data on hadronic abundances . supplemented by the proper definition of the spacetime geometry and hydrodynamic flow at freeze - out , the statistical models allow us to describe the transverse - momentum spectra and other soft - hadronic observables @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the recent lhc data on heavy - ion collisions show that the predictions of two popular versions of the statistical model ( the chemical equilibrium model and the strangeness non - equilibrium model ) give too large values for the kaon to pion ratio , @xmath7 , and , especially , for the ratio of protons to pions @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the recent fit @xcite gives almost three standard deviations higher values for protons and anti - protons compared to the lhc data .",
    "the pions , kaons and protons are the most abundant particles that are produced in heavy - ion collisions , therefore , this discrepancy is very uncomfortable for the thermal interpretation of hadron production . the problem with the correct description of protons is sometimes referred to as the _ proton puzzle _ @xcite .",
    "there have been two solutions to this puzzle proposed up to now .",
    "the first one is to use the urqmd model to calculate the modification factors for each particle and then to use these factors in the equilibrium statistical model to account for possible discrepancies @xcite .",
    "a clear disadvantage of this approach is that adding a hadronic afterburner to a thermal model spoils the natural simplicity of the latter  the main aim of introducing thermal models was to gain a simple description of hadron production which does not refer directly to the aspects of microscopic dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , using the kinetic model one can successfully attribute the modification factors to the baryon - antibaryon annihilation and other microscopic mechanisms which are taken into account by the urqmd simulations .",
    "the second solution to the proton puzzle has been achieved by assuming that statistical hadronization happens out of chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that it continues to use simple concepts of thermal approach not invoking directly to kinetic simulations .",
    "the mean multiplicities are explained by adding only two non - equilibrium parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( the hadron abundances scale with @xmath9 and @xmath10 depending on the number of the constituent light and strange quarks within a hadron ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the chemical non - equilibrium approach offers also a possibility to calculate the modification factors studied within the urqmd approach and to interpret them in terms of the non - equilibrium parameters .",
    "such a calculation may form a link between two alternative explanations of the data .",
    "besides the problems with thermal interpretation of the hadron abundances at the lhc , one encounters also the problems with the hydrodynamic interpretation of the transverse - momentum spectra of pions , kaons and protons , see fig .  1 in ref .",

    "quite a few hydrodynamic models are discussed in @xcite : vish2 + 1 @xcite , hkm @xcite , epos  @xcite and krakow  @xcite  .",
    "all these models exhibit a deficit in the very low-@xmath11 region , with the largest effect of about 2550% for pions in the most central collisions ( ) . in the ultra - peripheral collisions ( ) , the models fail to reproduce the data at both the low and high transverse momenta .",
    "similar features appear in the calculations presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "this situation is quite surprising , as the hydrodynamic models are supposed to work at low momenta , let us say up to @xmath12  gev .    in our earlier paper @xcite , we have shown that one can connect the proton puzzle with the anomalous behavior of the pion @xmath11 spectra and solve the two problems within the chemical non - equilibrium version of the cracow single freeze - out model .",
    "encouraged by the success of our approach , in this paper we extend our study to all measured hadrons including the recently measured strange mesons and baryons .",
    "following the same procedure as in @xcite , we take the values of _ thermodynamic _ parameters from ref .  @xcite and find the model _ geometric _ parameters from the fit to the pion and kaon spectra , only .",
    "in the next step , with the same parameters we determine the spectra of other hadrons . in this work",
    "we show that this strategy leads to an excellent description of the spectra of @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "a satisfactory description is also obtained for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "further improvement of the hyperon spectra may be achieved if we assume that they are emitted from a smaller , internal part of the system but still at the same chemical non - equilibrium thermodynamic conditions .    in @xcite",
    "we analyzed the @xmath11 spectra of pions , kaons and protons in the most central , , and semi - peripheral , , collisions . in this paper",
    "we consider all centrality classes from the most central , , to ultra - peripheral , , collisions and all particles measured by the alice collaboration up to now : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sect : themodel ] we introduce our approach based on the monte - carlo version of the cracow model as implemented in the therminator code @xcite .",

    "the general discussion of our physics results in section  [ sect : discussion ] and the two appendices close the paper .",
    "the starting point for our considerations is the cooper - frye formula .",

    "hence , the freeze - out hypersurface may be conveniently parameterized with the help of three variables . in our case",
    "we use the transverse distance from the collision axis , @xmath23 , the spacetime rapidity , @xmath24 , and the azimuthal angle , @xmath25 . since we consider a boost - invariant system , the integration over the spacetime rapidity @xmath26 in ( [ frye - cooper ] ) stretches from minus to plus infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "the integration over @xmath27 is restricted to the range @xmath28 , where @xmath29 defines the edge of a firecylinder .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath29 are the only two geometric parameters of the cracow model .",
    "the distribution function consists of primordial ( directly produced ) and secondary ( produced by resonance decays ) contributions .",
    "the decays are handled by therminator @xcite and include all particles and well established resonances .",
    "the primordial distribution of the @xmath30th hadron in the local rest frame has the form @xcite @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the degeneracy factor connected with spin , @xmath33 is the mass of the particle , @xmath34 is the particle s fugacity , and @xmath35 is the system s temperature .",
    "the @xmath36 sign corresponds to bosons ( fermions ) .",
    "the integration of the distribution function ( [ fi ] ) over three - momentum gives the hadron density @xmath37 similarly , the integration of the distribution ( [ frye - cooper ] ) over transverse - momentum gives the rapidity distribution @xmath38 . in the appendix [ app:1 ]",
    "we show that the freeze - out geometry of our model implies the relation   denotes the spacetime rapidity in our model , hence , eq .",
    "( [ dndydndeta ] ) means that the _ spacetime rapidity _ distribution is equal to the _ rapidity _ distribution . on the other hand , the _ pseudorapidity _ and _ rapidity _ densities are usually quite different , especially at @xmath39 @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath40 consequently , the knowledge of the thermodynamic parameters together with the rapidity density allows us to determine the system s volume per unit rapidity @xmath41 as we shall see below , an independent experimental estimate of this quantity may serve us to reduce the number of independent geometric parameters of our model from two to just one .",
    "the fugacity factor @xmath34 is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the electric , baryon , and strange chemical potentials in the system , while @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the electric charge , baryon number , and strangeness of the @xmath30th hadron @xcite .",

    ". the @xmath9 and @xmath10 parameters account for deviations from chemical equilibrium and affect the mean multiplicities of the particles with @xmath53 and @xmath54 quarks , respectively . in this work , similarly to our previous paper @xcite , we compare two cases : the non - equilibrium statistical hadronization version of the cracow model ( neq shm ) , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the equilibrium version ( eq shm ) , where @xmath59 .    in typical calculations , the use of the parameter @xmath10 does not lead to substantial modifications of other thermodynamic parameters , like temperature or volume , but helps to describe strange particles .",
    "the appearance of @xmath10 can be explained , for example , in the so called core - corona model @xcite , where a superposition of two sources of particle production is taken into account : single nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions and a fully equilibrated source .",
    "the use of @xmath60 ( to our knowledge , introduced for the first time in @xcite ) makes the freeze - out temperature and/or volume smaller , because it influences the most abundant particles in the medium : pions are multiplied by @xmath61 while protons by @xmath62 .",
    "the temperature found in the recent chemical non - equilibrium calculations @xcite is about @xmath63  mev .",
    "it is lower than the transition temperature obtained by the wuppertal - budapest collaboration , @xmath64 150170 mev .",
    "we note , however , that direct comparisons of the chemical non - equilibrium models ( i.e. , the models with @xmath65 and/or @xmath66 ) with the lattice simulations is inappropriate , since the lattice simulations are done for full chemical equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the temperature of freeze - out may be not connected with the phase transition temperature  we expect only that the latter is higher than the former .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that the case with @xmath57 and @xmath58 is equivalent to the introduction of the non - equilibrium chemical potentials @xmath67 and @xmath68 through the relation @xmath69 from eq .",
    "( [ upsineq2 ] ) one can conclude , for example , that the conditions @xmath70 or @xmath71 mean that the number of quark and anti - quark pairs in this case is larger than the corresponding equilibrium number obtained with the same temperature .",
    "this kind of phenomenon may appear because of fast expansion and cooling of the strongly interacting system .",
    "it can be also a result of the interplay between annihilation and recombination processes and , possibly , qcd mechanisms like the gluon condensation followed by the formation of low momentum @xmath72 pairs which fuse into pions which subsequently condense @xcite , see also @xcite . nevertheless , using eqs .",
    "( [ upsineq1 ] ) and ( [ upsineq2 ] ) we imply that there are only two parameters responsible for deviations from the standard statistical model  the corrections for all particles scale in the way corresponding to their quark content .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath9 used in ref .",
    "@xcite is equivalent to the pion chemical potential @xmath73mev , which is very close to the @xmath74 mass , @xmath75 .",
    "it may suggest that a substantial part of @xmath74 mesons form the condensate . since the prediction of the bose condensation in 1924  @xcite the beauty and simplicity of this phenomenon",
    "have attracted attention of many physicists  @xcite .",
    "however , only recently it has been confirmed experimentally in the system of cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "the high temperature bose condensation on the mev@xmath76k scale is also possible even in very small systems which are created in elementary particle collisions  @xcite .",
    "the bose condensate formed in the ultra - relativistic regime has been considered in refs .",

    "there are also interesting effects that appear inside of the pion condensate , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . besides that",

    "<S> we analyze the transverse - momentum spectra of strange hadrons produced in pb+pb collisions at the collision energy @xmath0  tev . </S>",
    "<S> our approach combines the concept of chemical non - equilibrium with the single - freeze - out scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the two ideas are realized in the framework of the cracow model , whose thermodynamic parameters have been established in earlier studies of the ratios of hadron multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric parameters of the model are obtained from the fit to the spectra of pions and kaons , only . using these parameters , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an excellent description of the spectra of protons and the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> a satisfactory description is also obtained for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons . </S>",
    "<S> further improvement of the hyperon spectra may be achieved if we assume that they are emitted from a smaller , internal part of the system but at the same thermodynamic conditions . </S>",
    "<S> our work not only includes all particle species measured up to now in heavy - ion collisions at the lhc energies but , in addition , discusses the centrality dependence of the particle production . </S>"
