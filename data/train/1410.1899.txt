    "the two constraint conditions in express the absence of electric charges and magnetic monopoles , respectively . if the computational domain @xmath0 is bounded , the system has to be complemented by appropriate boundary conditions",
    ". we will consider different types of conditions that all can be cast in the general abstract form @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the outward directed unit normal vector at the domain boundary .",
    "problems that are described by such a system of equations arise in various applications , for instance , in the modeling of optical wave guides @xcite or in antenna design @xcite . in such cases , boundary conditions of the form",
    "@xmath13 may be used to model various physically relevant situations , e.g. , the presence of perfect electric and magnetic conductors or the action of surface currents describing the emission of energy by an antenna , but also the presence of artificial boundaries resulting from a truncation of the domain @xmath0 which is often introduced to make a simulation feasible . following the physical intuition ,",
    "appropriate boundary conditions at such artificial boundaries should allow waves to leave the domain @xmath0 without significant reflection .",
    "the _ first order absorbing boundary condition _",
    "@xmath14 is widely used for this purpose ; here @xmath15 is the intrinsic impedance of the medium .",
    "this condition mimics the silver - mller radiation condition @xcite , and it is satisfied exactly by plane waves propagating in the outward normal direction .",
    "a brief inspection of the poynting vector @xmath16 reveals that energy is dissipated by transmission through the boundary at every point on the boundary .",
    "we will refer to this condition as _ first - order absorbing _ or _ silver - mller _ condition throughout the paper .",
    "the simple choice can be improved in several ways : in @xcite , a more accurate absorbing boundary condition is formulated that still involves only first order derivatives of the fields ; for a stability analysis , see also @xcite .",
    "other possibilities include the classical bayliss - turkel and enquist - majda conditions  @xcite and  @xcite , which allow to systematically construct conditions for arbitrary order . due to lack of stability",
    ", these are however hardly ever used in practice .",
    "let us also mention more recent approaches developed by warburton , hagstrom , higdon , and others  @xcite , the pole condition for the dirichlet - to - neumann operator , or the use of infinite elements .",
    "another strategy to minimize reflections from the artificial boundaries is to add an exterior absorbing layer , in which the fields decay very fast .",
    "this approach , known as perfectly matched layers , has been used very successfully in practice  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate choice of geometric and physical parameters of the absorbing layer is however not always completely clear in practice , and in some cases it may be necessary to extend the computational domain substantially . in principle , it is also possible to formulate exact boundary conditions , e.g. , by the coupling to a boundary integral formulation for the exterior domain  @xcite .",
    "this treatment leads to boundary conditions that are non - local in space and/or time  @xcite , which complicates numerical realization . for a review and a comparison of various kinds of non - absorbing , transparent , or non - reflecting boundary conditions ,",
    "let us refer to  @xcite and the references given there .    in this paper , we follow a different strategy for devising local transparent boundary conditions .",
    "the intuition behind our approach is the following : motivated by some of the approaches mentioned above , we assume that at any point of the boundary the electromagnetic fields can be expanded into , or at least approximated by , a superposition @xmath17 of plane waves propagating into specific directions @xmath18 .",
    "the three vectors @xmath19,@xmath20 , and @xmath21 are assumed to be normalized and orthogonal .",
    "if the wave is not reflected at the boundary , one would expect that @xmath22 incorporating such a condition in an adequate manner into a numerical scheme should therefore help to suppress non - physical reflections at artificial boundaries .",
    "a similar idea has been used previously in the context of finite difference trefftz schemes  @xcite . to evaluate the stability of such a boundary condition ,",
    "let us again consider the energy flux @xmath23 across the boundary .",
    "note that because of , the summation only runs over indices with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if the wave at the boundary is mainly propagating in one out - going direction , one can argue that the last term is dominated by the first term on the right hand side , and one obtains outflow of energy over the boundary .    in order to incorporate a boundary condition related to into a numerical method",
    ", one has to be able to split the approximation of the electromagnetic field locally into plane waves .",
    "this could be realized within the framework of generalized finite elements  @xcite or via trefftz finite difference approximations  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is provided by the discontinuous galerkin framework @xcite , which allows one to systematically couple almost arbitrary local approximations for the simulation on the global level and to incorporate rather general boundary and interface conditions by some sort of penalization .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a space - time discontinuous galerkin framework for maxwell s equations similar to that introduced in  @xcite , and we utilize polynomial trefftz functions for the local approximation which satisfy - exactly on every element .",
    "this results in a discontinuous galerkin trefftz method that has previously been described in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions  @xcite and later in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions  @xcite ; see also @xcite for a related trefftz method in acoustics .",
    "the numerical approximation of partial differential equations by trefftz functions has been proposed in @xcite and since then been investigated intensively ; see e.g. @xcite . since for the problem under investigation , the trefftz functions depend on space and time ,",
    "we automatically arrive at a space - time method .",
    "let us refer to @xcite for a review on the topic and also to @xcite for wave propagation problems in the frequency domain .",
    "one of the basic building blocks of our method is the explicit construction of a basis for the local trefftz spaces consisting of polynomial plane waves .",
    "this allows us to obtain the required local splitting of the discrete electromagnetic fields into plane waves .",
    "the second step consists in formulating a variational form of the absorbing boundary condition that can be incorporated within the discontinuous galerkin framework .",
    "similar to the realization of other boundary conditions in a discontinuous galerkin method , the condition will be satisfied approximately by some sort of penalization . to illustrate the benefits of our approach , we present numerical tests including a comparison with first order absorbing boundary conditions . in our computations ,",
    "we observe spectral convergence for a model problem , provided that the propagation directions of the polynomial plane wave basis functions are chosen appropriately .",
    "this indicates that the boundary condition may formally be accurate of arbitrary order . with our numerical tests",
    ", we also illustrate energy dissipation and thus stability of the absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] , we introduce the space - time discontinuous galerkin framework which is the basis for our numerical method . in section  [ sec :",
    "basis ] , we then construct the plane wave basis for the local trefftz approximation spaces and we sketch the construction for two - dimensional problems underlying our numerical tests .",
    "the implementation of the new transparent boundary condition is discussed in detail in section  [ sec : boundary ] , and results of numerical tests for two simple test problems are reported in section  [ sec : nr ] . the presentation closes with a short summary .",
    "for the numerical simulation of the initial boundary value problem  , we consider a space - time discontinuous galerkin method .",
    "we utilize trefftz polynomials for the local approximations which , by definition , satisfy maxwell s equations exactly .",
    "an appropriate choice of the basis allows us to expand the numerical solution locally into polynomial plane waves and to apply our new transparent boundary condition . in this section",

    "this will be done in section  [ sec : boundary ] .",
    "before we proceed , let us make some general remarks about this numerical scheme ; see @xcite for details and proofs .",
    "\\(i ) since the approximating functions satisfy maxwell s equations exactly on every element , the formulation only contains spatial and temporal interface terms , which penalize the tangential discontinuity of the fields .",
    "\\(ii ) assume that the true solution @xmath47 of problem  is sufficiently smooth and that the boundary terms are consistently chosen , e.g. , such that @xmath58 holds for every point on the boundary .",
    "under this assumption , the whole method is consistent , i.e. , any smooth solution of the problem  also satisfies the discrete variational principle . to see this ,",
    "let us have a closer look onto the discrete variational problem : by tangential continuity of the fields , the last term in the first line drops out .",
    "due to continuity in time , the first terms of the first and third line cancel , whereas the boundary terms cancel by assumption .",
    "( iii ) under mild conditions on the boundary terms , the discrete variational problem for one time slab can be shown to be well - posed .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the spatial mesh - size , @xmath60 the size of the time step , and @xmath61 the spatial dimension .",
    "then the first two terms , which are symmetric positive definite , scale like @xmath62 while the interface and boundary terms scale like @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the left hand side of the variational principle defines an elliptic bilinear form provided that the time step size is not too large .",
    "the smallness condition on @xmath64 can be dropped , if the boundary terms are dissipative in nature , which is the case for many relevant conditions ; see the remark at the end of ( iv ) .",
    "\\(iv ) the following energy identity holds @xmath65 this can be seen from adding a zero term @xmath66 to the variational principle , testing with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and some elementary algebraic manipulations ; see @xcite for details and proofs .",
    "the boundary term with @xmath69 arises from partial integration of one curl operator .",
    "( v ) assume that @xmath70 , which we call condition ( d ) .",
    "then the discrete variational problem is well - posed without any restriction on the time step size .",
    "condition ( d ) is in fact valid for various types of boundary conditions ; see section  [ sec : boundary ] for details . if additionally @xmath71 , then the discrete electromagnetic energy defined by @xmath72 is monotonically decreasing in time .",
    "we therefore call boundary conditions having the property ( d ) of _ dissipative _ nature . for details and proofs and some further properties of the resulting scheme ,",
    "let us refer to  @xcite ; similar results for related discontinuous galerkin methods based on more standard polynomial spaces can be found in  @xcite .",
    "method  [ meth : stdg ] yields an implicit time stepping scheme . to evolve the discrete solution from time step @xmath73 to time step @xmath74 , one has to solve a linear system corresponding to the discrete variational problem .",

    "also note that up to translation of time , the same basis can be used on every time slab .",
    "therefore , if the size of the time step is kept constant , i.e. , @xmath84 for all @xmath74 with some @xmath85 , then the matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 are independent of @xmath74 .",
    "this situation is particularly convenient from a computational point of view , since a factorization of the matrix @xmath86 may then be computed once _ a - priori _ , and the update of the coefficient vectors @xmath87 from step @xmath73 to @xmath74 only requires one matrix - vector multiplication and a forward - backward substitution .",
    "even if no factorization of @xmath88 is available , the linear system can be solved with acceptable computational effort by some iterative method , as the matrix @xmath88 stems from discretization of a linear hyperbolic problem and therefore usually has a moderate condition number .",
