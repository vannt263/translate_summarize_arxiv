    "various authors , motivated by ideas in parametric statistics @xcite , have discussed the advantages of taking a geometrical perspective on statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the `` distance '' between two probability distributions in parametric statistics can be measured using a geodesic distance which is calculated from the fisher information matrix for the system . in a statistical mechanical context",
    "the probability distributions of interest are gibbs measures @xmath8 where the @xmath9 characterise the state of the system ( e.g. spins ) , the @xmath10 are the various terms in the hamiltonian , the @xmath11 is the normalising partition function and the @xmath12 are the various parameters such as the inverse temperature @xmath0 , the external field @xmath1 , etc .",
    "the manifold @xmath13 of parameters is endowed with a natural riemannian metric , the fisher - rao metric @xcite , which measures the distance between different configurations . for a spin model in field @xmath13 is a two - dimensional manifold parameterised by @xmath14 .",
    "the components of the fisher - rao metric take the simple form @xmath15 in this case , where @xmath16 is the reduced free energy per site and @xmath17 . a natural object to consider in any geometrical approach",
    "is the scalar or gaussian curvature which may be calculated as @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "it is worth remarking that , unlike most standard statistical mechanical observables , the curvature @xmath2 depends on third order derivatives .",
    "nonetheless , a plausible scaling relation has been advanced for @xmath2 in the critical region .",
    "the hypothesis , on dimensional grounds , is that the curvature depends on the correlation volume for a second - order transition @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the correlation length and @xmath22 is the dimension of the system .",
    "this is reasonable since @xmath21 is the only physical scale in the system near criticality .",
    "combined with hyperscaling , @xmath23 , and standard scaling assumptions this leads to @xmath24 in the above @xmath7 is the standard exponent characterising the scaling of the specific heat , so consideration of @xmath2 clearly offers a way of determining critical exponents in a non - standard manner .    analytic determination of @xmath2 in spin models has been limited by the necessity of carrying out calculations in field .",
    "one case where this is possible is the 1d ising model @xcite , where the curvature was calculated to be @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "the 1d ising model can be thought of as having a zero - temperature transition , so looking at @xmath27 , @xmath28 we see that @xmath29 , corresponding to the expected @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , it is possible to obtain an expression for the scalar curvature for the ising model on a bethe lattice @xcite , where the scaling behaviour is also verified .",
    "both of these examples have unsatisfactory aspects  the 1d ising model has no real transition and the bethe lattice ising model is mean field in nature .    given the relative paucity of models which are soluble in field any further explicit calculations would be welcome , particularly in a non - mean - field model with a genuine finite - temperature phase transition . in the sequel",
    "we discuss one such case , the ising model on dynamical planar random graphs .",
    "the solution of the ising model on an ensemble of @xmath31 ( @xmath32-regular ) or @xmath33 ( @xmath34-regular ) planar random graphs was first presented by boulatov and kazakov @xcite , who were motivated by string - theoretic considerations , since the continuum limit of the theory represents matter coupled to 2d quantum gravity .",
    "they considered the partition function for the ising model on a single @xmath35 vertex planar graph with connectivity matrix @xmath36 @xmath37 then summed it over all @xmath35 vertex graphs @xmath38 resulting in @xmath39 before finally forming the grand - canonical sum over graphs with different numbers @xmath35 of vertices @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "this last expression could be calculated exactly as matrix integral over @xmath42 hermitian matrices , @xmath43   \\right ) , \\label{matint}\\ ] ] where the @xmath44 limit is to be taken to pick out the planar diagrams and the potential appropriate for @xmath31 ( 4-regular ) random graphs has been shown .",
    "when the matrix integral is carried out the solution is given in parametric form by @xmath45 where the function @xmath46 is @xmath47 \\label{geq}\\ ] ] and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "in the thermodynamic limit the free energy per site is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the appropriate low- or high - temperature solution of @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath27 this may be solved in closed form , and although the solution is not available explicitly for non - zero @xmath1 it can still be developed as a power series in @xmath1 around the zero - field solutions in order to obtain expressions for quantities such as the energy , specific  heat , magnetization and susceptibility .",
    "it was found that the critical exponents were given by @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , so the transition was _ third _ order with , intriguingly , the same exponents as the 3d spherical model on a regular lattice @xcite .",
    "if we carry out a perturbative expansion for the high - temperature solution , which is symmetric in @xmath1 and hence a series in even powers , we find @xmath55 where the coefficients in the series are most naturally expressed in terms of @xmath56 , as above .",
    "the expected scaling form of the various components of @xmath2 for a generic spin model in field is discussed at some length in @xcite , and we now recapitulate these results briefly for comparison with the specific results for the ising model on planar random graphs in the next section . the starting point is the scaling form of the free energy per spin near the critical point , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the scaling dimensions for the energy and spin operators . for @xmath60 ,",
    "i.e. , in the unbroken high - temperature phase , we can use standard scaling assumptions to write this as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a scaling function and we also define @xmath63 and @xmath64 for later convenience . in terms of the standard critical exponents",

    "@xmath1 will vanish so @xmath73 rather than @xmath74 .",
    "this does not affect the stated scaling relations .",
    "however , one feature of these scaling relations does have an impact on the observed scaling for the ising model .",
    "generically one expects that @xmath75 , which contributes to both the metric and the determinant involved in calculating @xmath2 . if @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 , this naively suggests a vanishing @xmath78 at criticality , which will in general _ not _ be the case .",
    "there would instead be a contribution from a regular term , which would give a constant at the critical point .",
    "having such a constant term modifies the scaling form of @xmath2 in the case @xmath79 , @xmath80 to @xmath81 where we have denoted the constant by @xmath82 . the scaling for @xmath83",
    "is also modified to @xmath84    when expanded the expression for @xmath2 contains two term which now have differing orders in @xmath85 .",
    "the leading term for @xmath76 , the case which we are interested in , is @xmath86 or @xmath87 so the critical exponent @xmath7 no longer appears in the scaling exponent .    by virtue of the boulatov and kazakov solution the ising model on planar random graphs allows us to explicitly confirm these observations , as we see in the next section .",
    "since @xmath88 , we have @xmath89 , @xmath90 and the modified discussion of scaling should apply .",

    "( [ finalscaling ] ) when @xmath99 is set equal to @xmath103 .    in fig .  1 we have plotted @xmath2 close to @xmath94 using a series correct up to @xmath104 terms .",
    "the scaling region in @xmath1 is very narrow , with the approximation to @xmath2 rapidly giving large negative values outside this region due to the increasingly strong divergences in the series coefficients as @xmath105 for increasing order in @xmath1 .",
    "this turnover is just visible on the edges of the plotted surface .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath1 would have to be carefully handled in any numerical investigations of @xmath2 . within the domain of validity of the expansion in @xmath1 it appears that @xmath2 is positive .",
    "it has been remarked @xcite that @xmath2 is positive in the thermodynamic limit for ising models when the parameters take physical values , with the only divergence being at the critical point , and the ising model here provides another example .",
    "this feature is apparently not universal , calculations of @xmath2 for the one - dimensional potts model @xcite and field theories @xcite do not give positive curvatures throughout the physical parameter space .",
    "it has been observed that the line @xmath27 is a geodesic of the metric for the one - dimensional ising and potts models @xcite .",
    "the geodesic equations using co - ordinates @xmath95 are given in general by @xmath106 where @xmath107 parameterises the flow lines , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , the @xmath110 are the christoffel symbols and @xmath111 allows for the possibility of a non - affine parameter choice .",
    "a vector field with a flow line along @xmath27 has @xmath112 , so in this case equs .",
    "( [ geodesic1 ] ) and ( [ geodesic2 ] ) reduce to @xmath113 the first of these equations for @xmath114 always has a solution and the second requires @xmath115 .",
    "this is satisfied for the ising model on planar random graphs because the christoffel symbol @xmath116 vanishes at @xmath27 for the same reason as in the one - dimensional models  the off - diagonal components of the metric @xmath117 are @xmath118 in all cases .",
    "we therefore find that for the ising model on planar random graphs @xmath27 is also a geodesic line in the @xmath95 plane .",
    "we close with a remark on the infinite temperature ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) limit of @xmath2 when @xmath27 . in this limit @xmath2",
    "was found to be 2 for the one - dimensional ising model @xcite and @xmath122 for the ising model on a @xmath123 co - ordinated bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "here we find that @xmath124 , so if we accept the suggestion in @xcite that @xmath125 should be taken as a measure of fluctuations caused by the spin interactions the correct measure of the deviation from ideal paramagnetism for the ising model on planar random graphs is @xmath126 .",
    "we have calculated the scaling behaviour of the scalar curvature of the fisher - rao metric for the ising model on planar random graphs using the exact solution of @xcite combined with a perturbative expansion in the external field @xmath1 .",
    "although @xmath52 for this model , @xmath127 rather than the @xmath128 one might have expected naively from general scaling arguments .",
    "this discrepancy was traced back to the effect that a negative value of @xmath7 had on the scaling of the various components of the metric and the terms which contributed to @xmath2 .    various qualitative features of the calculated @xmath2 tally with earlier observations of one - dimensional and mean - field ising models .",
    "it is positive ( within the domain of applicability of our semi - perturbative calculation ) and diverges only at the critical point .",
    "the zero - field line is seen to be a geodesic , just as for the one - dimensional ising and potts models .",
