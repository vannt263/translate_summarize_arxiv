    "the spin-@xmath9 anisotropic heisenberg model , or the xxz model , is one of the most important quantum spin models , which can be used to explain the quantum essence of many magnetic materials , such as la@xmath10cuo@xmath11 and thin films of @xmath12he@xcite .",
    "recently , for this model , many works have been done on translational symmetric latticespaper2,paper3,paper4,paper5,squre , paper6,paper7 .",
    "for example , f c alcaraz and a l malvezzi studied the xxz chain in the presence of an external field and obtained the phase diagram of this system accurately@xcite .",
    "continentino and sousa , respectively , have investigated the critical properties of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) anisotropic heisenberg modelpaper4,paper5,squre , and found that , in the isotropic heisenberg limit , this system does not exhibit finite temperature phase transition ( i.e. , the critical temperature @xmath13 ) , which is in accordance with the theorem of mermin and wagner@xcite . however , as to this model on the simple cubic lattice @xmath14 no longer equals zero in the isotropic heisenberg limit , which means the existence of finite temperature phase transitionpaper6,paper7,paper9,paper10,paper11 .    on the other hand",
    ", there has been some interest in the critical phenomena of xxz model on fractal lattices , and particularly on the diamond - type hierarchical ( dh ) lattices .",
    "because of the special geometrical and topological property , dh lattices are good candidates to investigate the spin systems in non - integer dimensions , and since they have a much lower symmetry than other fractals , so they may provide insights into other low - symmetry problems such as random magnets , surfaces , and the likekaufman1,paper18 . in these aspects , some theoretical works have been done . in 1983 , using the renormalization group ( rg ) method , caride _",
    "et al _ have investigated the critical behavior of the heisenberg model on the wheatstone - bridge - basis hierarchical lattice .",
    "their results show that in the isotropic heisenberg limit @xmath14 approaches zero as a continuous function of the anisotropic parameter@xcite .",
    "latterly , the phase diagram of this model was obtained by souza on another kind of dh lattice with fractal dimension @xmath15@xcite , and the results agree well with those on the square lattice .",
    "recently , using a real - space rg method , the anisotropic heisenberg spin - glass model on a three - dimensional dh lattice has been studied@xcite .    in the study of the anisotropic heisenberg model ,",
    "many effective approximate methods have been applied . such as the mean - field approximation@xcite ,",
    "series expansion@xcite , rg method @xcite and monte carlo simulation@xcite , etc . among these methods ,",
    "the rg theory has been proved to be very powerful and it has been widely used to investigate the critical behavior of different spin systemspaper2,paper6,paper14,paper15 .    in this paper , using the rg method , we investigate the quantum spin-@xmath9 xxz ferromagnetic model on two kinds of dh lattices with fractal dimensions @xmath16 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "our results show that the systems exhibit finite temperature phase transitions in the isotropic heisenberg limit @xmath17 . besides",
    ", we also investigate the above systems in the range of @xmath5 and find that they exhibit xy - like fixed points .",

    "iv is a discussion about some interesting quantum effects and sec .",
    "v gives a brief conclusion .",
    "some of the more tedious of the formulations in sec .",
    "ii are illustrated in the appendix .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the xxz model can be written as   @xmath18 ,   \\label{eq1}\\]]where @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is the exchange coupling parameter ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic model , respectively ) , @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath24 is the absolute temperature .",
    "@xmath25 @xmath26 are spin pauli operators on the site @xmath27 .",
    "the sum is over all the nearest - neighbor spin pairs @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 $ ] represents the anisotropic parameter .",
    "note that the hamiltonian contains , as particular cases , the ising model @xmath31for @xmath32 , the isotropic heisenberg model @xmath31for @xmath33 and the xy model ( for @xmath34 ) .",
    "the dh lattices are all constructed by an iterative manner .",
    "1@xmath35 illustrates the first three construction stages of dh lattice with fractal dimension @xmath2 ( lattice a , for simplicity ) . as can be seen , the initiator is a two - point lattice joined by a single bond ( construction stage @xmath36 ) . then the initiator is replaced with the generator ( the cluster of @xmath37 stage ) . replacing every single bond on the generator itself , we get the second stage of the lattice .",
    "if this procedure is repeated infinite times , we then construct a dh lattice with self - similar structurepaper16,paper162,paper17,paper18 . using the same procedure as that of lattice a , we can construct another kind of dh lattice ( lattice b , for simplicity ) with fractal dimension @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "1@xmath38 ) .    in this section ,",
    "using the rg method proposed by caride@xcite , we give the main calculation procedure of the xxz ferromagnetic model on lattice a. the case of lattice b can be solved in the same way .    in the next rg procedure , the hamiltonians , except for the ising limit @xmath39 and the high temperature limit @xmath40 , among the neighboring generators do not commute with each other , which leads to the impossible of decoupling the genorator from the whole lattice . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "the noncommutativity among the neighboring generators were neglected .",
    "this method had been used in refs.paper12,paper13,paper19,paper20 and the quantum effects and the approximation of this method had been detailedly discussed in ref.paper20 .    based on the above approximation , we take out the generator from lattice a to perform the rg transformation , which is shown in fig .",
    "2 . as can be seen , after summation of the internal spins @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( decimation ) , the generator ( fig .",

    "the quantum fluctuation of xy - like model ( @xmath141 ) is stronger than the anistropic heisenberg model ( @xmath142 ) at the low - temperature region .",
