    "detectors of chemical substances are usually based on selective adsorption - desorption ( binding - releasing ) of analyzed chemicals by specific adsorbing sites ( receptor molecules ) .",
    "the receptor molecules are attached to an electronic device able to measure the amount of the analyte adsorbed during the binding - releasing process .",
    "the device may be either a mems device , such as quartz crystal microbalance @xcite , or vibrating / bending cantilever @xcite , or field effect transistor @xcite , or other @xcite .",
    "the device with the receptor molecules is called chemical sensor or detector . in order to be useful",
    ", the detector must be able to discriminate between different chemicals , to be selective .",
    "its selectivity is normally the same as that of its receptor molecules ( see eqs.([linprop],[condetsel ] ) ) .",
    "the size of industrial sensors has constant tendency to decrease @xcite .",
    "the power of useful signal produced by a small detector becomes very small . as a result , noise of the detector itself constitutes a substantial portion of its output signal .",
    "depending on its construction , there are several reasons for a small detector to be noisy @xcite .",
    "one type of noise is due to the fact that the adsorption - desorption process is driven by brownian motion , which is stochastic . as a result",
    ", the instantaneous total amount of adsorbed analyte is subjected to irregular fluctuations visible in the output signal .",
    "this noise is called the adsorption - desorption noise @xcite .",
    "it is present in any small detector which is based on binding - releasing of analyte .",
    "the adsorption - desorption noise can dominate over all other types of intrinsic noise @xcite .    in this paper only the adsorption - desorption noise",
    "is taken into account .",
    "the detector is expected to be a threshold detector ( thd ) , fig.[thd ] .",
    "namely , the fluctuating signal characterizing the amount of adsorbed analyte in the primary sensing unit ( psu in fig.[thd ] ) is fed into amplitude discriminator unit ( threshold unit , thu in fig.[thd ] ) .",
    "the threshold unit is characterized by a certain threshold .",
    "it has zero as its output if the adsorbed amount is below the threshold , and it outputs standard dc signal while the adsorbed amount is equal or above the threshold . the output of thu is averaged over a sliding time - window to have final output practically time - independent .",
    "this signal is considered as the output of the thd .    in this paper ,",
    "the temporal properties of the binding - releasing stochastic process are utilized to characterize the outputs of thd if two analytes are separately presented at equal concentrations .",
    "this allows to compare selectivity of thd with that of its receptor molecules .",
    "the main conclusion is that the thd may be much more selective than do its adsorbing sites .",
    "the adsorption - desorption process is described by the following association - dissociation chemical reaction # 1#2 a+r ar , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 denote molecules of analyte , adsorption site or receptor , and analyte - receptor binary complex , respectively . at constant temperature , the rate constants , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are time - independent . they can be determined either from experimental measurements , or estimated theoretically @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 denotes the total number of receptor molecules per detector .",
    "the analyte is presented at concentration @xmath7 .",
    "the probability @xmath8 for any @xmath2 to be bound with @xmath1 is ) is justified . ]",
    "p = k_+ck_+c+k_- .",
    "the mean number of adsorbed molecules , @xmath9 , can be calculated as follows : @xmath10 if two different analytes @xmath11 , @xmath12 are tested at the same concentration , either the eq.([proba1 ] ) , or experimental measurements will give two values , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "we say that the receptor molecule has selectivity with respect to @xmath11 , @xmath12 , if @xmath15 ( expect , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the molecular selectivity , @xmath17 , is defined as than eq.([mudef ] ) should be replaced by @xmath18@xmath19 , the dissociation constant is defined as @xmath20_{1/2}=k_-/k_+.$ ] eq.([proba1 ] ) can be rewritten using the dissociation constant : @xmath21_{1/2}/c).$ ] from this equation it is clear that analytes with different dissociation constants have different binding probabilities and vice versa .",
    "this proves suitability of both descriptions , even if numerical values of selectivity expressed in terms of dissociation constants , say as @xmath22_{1/2}/[a_1]_{1/2}),$ ] will differ from used here .",
    "the @xmath17 values can be expressed in terms of dissociation constants : @xmath23_{1/2})/(c+[a_1]_{1/2})).$ ] the main difference between the @xmath24 and @xmath17 is that the latter depends on concentration .",
    "this is in accordance with situation in natural olfactory systems where discriminating ability usually depends on concentration @xcite . ] = .",
    "the primary signal , @xmath25 in fig.[thd ] , usually increases if the number @xmath26 of adsorbed molecules increases : n > ns_0>s_0 , where the exact dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath26 is determined by the sensor construction and the transduction mechanism it employes . for simplicity , it is expected that in the case of gravimetric sensor , @xmath11 and @xmath12 have equal molecular masses .",
    "define selectivity @xmath28 for a whole detector in terms of final output signal ( @xmath29 in fig.[thd ] ) as follows : = , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the final outputs for analytes @xmath11 , @xmath12 , respectively .    both @xmath25 and @xmath32 are subjected to adsorption - desorption noise . in a detector without the threshold unit ,",
    "the final output signal can be made linearly proportional to the mean number of adsorbed molecules : s_i~p_in , i=1,2 .",
    "this is achieved either by temporal averaging , or by choosing large detector with powerful primary signal in which contribution of adsorption - desorption fluctuations is not visible . substituting ( [ linprop ] ) into ( [ defsel1 ] )",
    "one obtains for selectivity of a conventional detector = = .",
    "thus , selectivity of detector in which the fluctuations are averaged out either immediately after the primary sensing unit , or inside it is equal to that of its individual adsorbing sites .",
    "the threshold unit , thu , rises a threshold which the @xmath27 must overcome in order to make possible further stages of processing . the crossing may happen from time to time thanking to the adsorption - desorption fluctuations .",
    "due to ( [ increasing ] ) , the threshold can be characterized by the number @xmath33 of analyte molecules which must be adsorbed before the nonzero signal appears at the output end of the thu .",
    "it is assumed that the thu is ideal in a sense that the @xmath33 is the exact value which is not subjected to fluctuations . if @xmath33 is achieved , the thu has standard constant signal as its output . the signal does not depend on the exact value of @xmath32 provided it is above or equal to @xmath33 .",
    "denote by @xmath34 the temporal window over which the averaging is made in the tau ( fig.[thd ] ) , and by @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) the total amount of time during which @xmath32 is below or above the threshold , respectively , when @xmath38 .",
    "the final output , @xmath29 in fig.[thd ] , should be linearly proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "this gives for the selectivity of thd : = , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 correspond to @xmath11 , @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "in accordance with ( [ defsel2 ] ) , it is necessary to estimate the total amount of time the @xmath32 spends above the threshold when @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "this can be done by adding together lengths of all separate intervals during which @xmath43 continuously .",
    "denote by @xmath44 the number of those intervals , and by @xmath45 , @xmath46 the length of the @xmath47-th continuous interval .",
    "then @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the length of @xmath47-th continuous interval during which @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath34 together with @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 ensures that @xmath44 is large , then the last expression can be rewritten in the following form t_a = t|t_ac|t_bc+|t_ac , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the mean lengths of the continuous intervals . for the @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath52 the following expressions have been obtained @xcite based on the kolmogoroff ( or backward master ) equation :     analytes , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are considered , then in ( [ bartbc ] ) , ( [ bartac ] ) , @xmath5 and @xmath8 should be replaced with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , respectively . substituting ( [ bartbc ] ) , ( [ bartac ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ tave ] ) one obtains see also @xcite , where equivalent to ( [ taf ] ) conclusion is obtained based on simpler and less rigorous reasoning not using eqs .",

    "this gives = .",
    "the last equation can be replaced by a transparent estimate if one use the following inequality > ( p_1p_2)^nn_0/n - p_11-p_1 , which is proven in @xcite .",
    "substitution of ( [ ineq0 ] ) into eq.([deltafrac ] ) gives > np_0-p_11-p_1,p_0=n_0/n .",
    "taking into account that the total number of adsorbing sites , @xmath6 , as well as @xmath33 can be very large , it is clear from the estimate ( [ ineq1 ] ) that @xmath28 can be much larger than @xmath17 , provided the fraction @xmath56 is not very small .",
    "it must be at least positive , which requires p_0>p_1,p_1n < n_0 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath13 increases with concentration ( see eq.([proba1 ] ) ) , inequality ( [ ineq2 ] ) can be considered as imposing an upper limit for concentration @xmath7 at which the effect of selectivity improvement might be expected based on the estimate ( [ ineq1 ] ) .",
    "it is worth to notice that when condition ( [ ineq2 ] ) holds , the mean amount of adsorbed analyte is below the threshold one , and threshold crossing may happen only due to fluctuations .",
    "as one can conclude from the estimate ( [ ineq1 ] ) , the selectivity improvement is higher for higher @xmath33 . on the other hand , one can not chose the @xmath33 as high as desired because the thu in fig.[thd ] is expected to be ideal .",
    "if one chose @xmath57 then the ideality means that the threshold level in the thu is allowed to have less then 1% jitter .",
    "similarly , if one chose @xmath58 then the threshold level must be kept with better than 0.01% precision .",
    "otherwise , noise in the threshold level should be taken into account in the reasoning of n.[estpar ] , and this will lead to a less promising estimate .    .[rates ] the rate constants used in the examples of table [ table ] and in fig .",

    "concentration dependencies of @xmath17 , @xmath28 , and the estimate ( [ ineq1 ] ) are shown in fig.[graphs ] .",
    "a short segment of the trajectory @xmath32 modelled on pc is shown in fig.[trajec ] .",
    "in this paper , selectivity of chemical sensor is compared with that of its primary receptors ( adsorbing sites ) .",
    "the sensor is expected to be a small one , in which the main source of noise is due to the adsorption - desorption fluctuations . in the sensor",
    "considered , the signal from the primary sensing unit is immediately subjected to the amplitude discrimination defined in the introduction , and obtained piecewise - constant signal ( @xmath59 in fig.[thd ] ) is averaged over a time window . the averaged signal ( @xmath29 in fig.[thd ] ) is taken as the output of whole sensor .",
    "the threshold - crossing statistics derived from the exact description of the adsorption - desorption stochastic process is used for estimating selectivity . as a result",
    ", it is concluded that selectivity of this sensor can be much better than that of its primary receptors .",
    "the effect may be expected in a limited range of concentrations of analytes , which depends on the threshold level . for high concentrations",
    "the selectivity falls to that of the primary receptors ( fig.[graphs ] ) , and for low ones the output signal will be too small even for more affine analyte .",
    "the best situation is expected when the mean number of bound receptors is just below the threshold one , and the threshold is frequently crossed due to the presence of fluctuations .",
    "thus , in practical realization a possibility of tuneable threshold should be considered .",
    "usually , noise in sensory devices is taken as unfavorable factor . in this consideration",
    ", the presence of noise looks like factor improving the sensor performance . but with the ideal threshold unit in hands much can be done even without noise .",
    "expect that the noise is initially averaged out either by spatial averaging ( choosing big primary unit with large @xmath6 ) , or by temporal averaging ( interchanging tau with thu in fig.[thd ] ) .",
    "the averaged signals for the @xmath11 , @xmath12 can be very close ( see eq .",
    "[ linprop ] ) , but the ideal thu with tunable threshold will be able to discriminate perfectly between them .",
    "thus , even if the fluctuations in this sensor are made working , the answer what is better to do first for the practical purposes : the amplitude discrimination , or temporal averaging , depends on physical parameters of the environment in which the sensor operates , and on physical characteristics of the sensor itself , including intensity of noises other than the adsorption - desorption one .",
    "interesting , in natural olfactory systems , a kind of amplitude discrimination is made immediately after the primary reception @xcite .",
    "also in those systems the threshold is tunable due to adaptation of individual neurons .",
