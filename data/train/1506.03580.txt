    "consider a pipeline punctuated by several pumping stations .",
    "suppose the pumping stations are redundant in that , if one of them fails , then its predecessor will be strong enough to pump the fluid past it to the next pumping station .",
    "perhaps each pump will even be able to compensate for the failure of its successor and its successor s successor , but perhaps not for the failure of the first 3 pumping stations in the chain of its succesors . in this case",
    ", the system fails if and only if among the sequence of pumping stations there exists a consecutive run of 3 or more failed pumping stations .",
    "this is an example of what is known as a consecutive-@xmath1-out-@xmath2:f system .",
    "suppose that such a system having @xmath2 nodes fails if and only if @xmath1 consecutive nodes fail , and suppose that any given node in the system works correctly with probability @xmath7 $ ] , independently of the other nodes .",
    "then the probability that any given node fails is @xmath8 .",
    "the _ reliability _ of the system is the probability @xmath9 that the system does not fail",
    ". then @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the probability that the sequence of @xmath2 nodes includes a contiguous interval of @xmath1 or more failed nodes .",
    "here we are using notation as in @xcite .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the concept of the reliability of a consecutive system was introduced to engineering by kontoleon in 1980 @xcite . in the following year chiang and",
    "niu @xcite discussed some applications of consecutive systems .",
    "the concept has been generalised in several directions , for instance to systems deemed to have failed if and only if they include : @xmath1 consecutive failed components _ or _ @xmath12 failed components @xcite ; @xmath1 consecutive components of which at least @xmath13 have failed @xcite ; at least @xmath14 non - overlapping runs of @xmath1 consecutive failed components @xcite . in 2001",
    "chang , cui and hwang published a book on the subject @xcite .",
    "four reviews are also available @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an exact formula for @xmath15 first appeared in @xcite .",
    "de moivre s approach depends on deriving the generating function ( see @xcite ) for @xmath16 .",
    "this work has been rephrased in a modern style in @xcite .",
    "much later a different exact formula for @xmath15 using markov chains was found @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both of these exact formulae for @xmath15 are difficult to use in engineering , where values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 may be very large .",
    "efficient algorithms have been found ( @xcite and @xcite ) but even with modern computing resources , evaluating the formulae takes a lot of time and memory .",
    "this problem has been addressed at length in the study of upper and lower bounds for @xmath15 .",
    "such bounds have been found which are close approximations to the exact value of @xmath15 and which are also much easier to evaluate than the exact value of @xmath15 . in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "the authors compare many such results from the 1980s to the present day .",
    "du and beiu were the first to use de moivre s original formula to derive upper and lower bounds for @xmath15 .",
    "as shown in @xcite this method compares very favourably with the previous upper and lower bounds , especially for small @xmath17 , and also with the exact algorithms given in @xcite and @xcite ( using their bounds is about 100 times faster than the algorithm from @xcite , and 1000 times faster than the algorithm from @xcite ) .",
    "one possible extension to higher dimensions is as follows : given @xmath18 and @xmath19 , suppose that some system is represented by an @xmath20 array of 0s and 1s .",
    "suppose that each node in the array is 0 with probability @xmath21 $ ] and is 1 with probability @xmath8 , independently of the other nodes .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 are given , with @xmath23 for each @xmath13 , and suppose that the system is deemed to have failed if and only if the @xmath0-dimensional array includes a contiguous @xmath24 subarray of 1s .",
    "define the reliability of the system as the probability @xmath25 that the system does not fail , and let @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 is the probability that the array includes a contiguous @xmath24 subarray of 1s .",
    "let us survey in chronological order some recent papers dealing with the higher dimensional case .",
    "in @xcite the 2-dimensional special case @xmath28 is treated .",
    "upper and lower bounds are found by reducing to the 1-dimensional case . using empirical approximations to the exact value",
    ", @xmath28 is plotted as a function of @xmath17 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and for @xmath35 and @xmath36 and 20 .",
    "the authors do not attempt to find an explicit expression for @xmath28 .",
    "in @xcite the 2-dimensional case is considered , for @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "exact formulae are derived by comparison with the 1-dimensional case .",

    "the 2-dimensional case @xmath28 of @xcite is revisited in @xcite . again",
    ", upper and lower bounds are given , but in the more general case where the probabilities of distinct nodes of the system failing are not necessarily equal .",
    "for the general 2-dimensional case @xmath39 , recursive formulae for the exact reliability have been given by yamamoto and miyakawa @xcite and also by noguchi , sasaki , yanagi and yuge @xcite .",
    "the result presented herein is distinct from their work , in that we give a closed - form formula for the exact reliability as a polynomial in @xmath17 , for a general system , of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the 3-dimensional case is treated in @xcite , where exact formulae for the reliability are given in special cases analogous to those studied in @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we derive general closed - form exact formulae for @xmath40 and for @xmath41 , where the dimension @xmath18 is arbitrary . as far as the author knows , no such formulae were known before for @xmath42 , even in the case @xmath43 . indeed ,",
