    "the study of quantum dynamics controlled by an external field has rapidly developed over the past 30 years @xcite . here , the _ quantum control _ objective is typically to design an external electromagnetic field which coherently manipulates a quantum system from an initial state to a desired final state .",

    "while model - based control of low - dimensional systems , such as nuclear spin states , has been performed successfully , limitations in field generation and shaping technology and imperfect knowledge of the system render model - based control of higher - dimensional systems ( for e.g. molecular ro - vibrational states ) more challenging @xcite .",

    "robustness_. control of quantum dynamics that maintains high fidelity in the presence of these types of uncertainty is referred to as robust quantum control @xcite .",
    "various approaches to quantification of robustness have been proposed in the engineering literature @xcite , with the majority being based on leading order taylor expansions of the control performance measure .",
    "robustness of control is generally expressed in terms of moments of the distribution of the performance measure @xmath0 @xcite , or the distance between the nominal performance measure and its worst - case value ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "there are several methods for approximating the latter in the presence of uncertainty @xcite .",

    "for example , one study described how phase noise reduces the control pulse area and , in turn , the population transfer as shifts in the spectral frequency lead to inefficient resonance and lack of constructive pathway interferences @xcite .",
    "another study @xcite examined the inherent degree of robustness in an optimal control field due to the bilinearity of quantum observable expectation values in the evolution operator and its adjoint .",
    "more recent studies on quantum robust control have introduced several types of numerical approximations such as leading order expansions in order to quantify robustness @xcite .    in engineering control , leading order taylor expansions are commonly applied in conjunction with real - time feedback control that corrects for deviations between the desired and actual trajectories . in the absence of real - time feedback ( which is currently impossible for many important quantum systems ) , leading order taylor expansions can be inaccurate in the prediction of the moments of state variables .",

    "in addition , different quantum pathways involved in the controlled dynamics are delineated such that qualitative and quantitative analysis of robustness may be more precisely discussed in terms of the moments of interferences between different order pathways and their contributions to the transition amplitude and probability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ section2 ] describes the theory of quantum control via combination and interference of quantum pathways . in section [ section3 ] , methods for characterization of uncertainty in the system hamiltonian and control field are briefly presented as a starting point in quantum control robustness analysis . the procedure for calculating the robustness criteria",

    "quantum pathway_. prior work has considered the characterization of quantum pathways in the context of quantum control mechanism analysis @xcite . in the context of robustness analysis ,",
    "a quantum pathway is a term in the dyson series expansion written in terms of the products of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( or its log ) denotes either a control variable or a time - independent hamiltonian parameter .",
    "this includes the conventional multiphoton pathways ( or combinations thereof ) as well as other types of pathways as will be described below . like multiphoton pathways",

    "phase pathways will be considered in a separate work .",
    "given the definition of quantum pathways as associated with the control and system parameters , the quantum control robustness can be precisely described .",
    "indeed , the robustness may be defined in terms of how distribution and magnitude of variations in the field s amplitude and phase parameters and system s dipole moments change the trajectory of the quantum pathways and , hence , the transition amplitude and probability . extending from the concepts of @xcite , we can express as robustness criteria the moments of the ( quantum pathway ) interferences and transition amplitude and probability .",

    "the theory and methodologies developed herein are most conveniently applied to disturbances wherein the frequency domain correlation function is a physically natural representation , which is the case for intensity and phase noise in laser control @xcite .",
    "the eventual goal of robustness analysis is to understand how a control field achieves robust transition amplitude and probability when uncertainty is present in the control field or the system parameters .",
    "we consider robustness of the control performance measure ( e.g. , transition probability ) to variations @xmath79 in the parameters . assuming the covariance matrix of parameter estimates is available as in ( [ fisher ] ) , the posterior distribution of @xmath79 is modeled as a multivariate normal distribution , i.e. , @xmath80 . through choice of a confidence level @xmath81",

    ", one can not derive a distribution function for @xmath0 analytically , although various approximate numerical methods have been proposed @xcite .",
    "worst - case robustness analysis can be formulated either in terms of maximization of the magnitude of the performance measure deviation @xmath93 subject to the inequality constraints on @xmath79 in ( [ distrib ] ) , or directly in terms of an approximation to the pdf of @xmath0 .",

    "control system linearization ( as well as associated leading order taylor expansions ) can be inaccurate as a method for prediction of the moments of state variables - and hence robustness of observable quantities to parameter uncertainty and disturbances  since the variance of the state variable deviations increases rapidly with evolution time and the linearized system is no longer an accurate approximation to the true nonlinear system .",
    "methods such as feedforward control are computationally less intensive and quantum feedforward controllers have been proposed based on linearized control systems @xcite .    most quantum robust control strategies typically apply leading order approximations to quantify the robustness of the control fidelity to system parameter uncertainty or field disturbances @xcite . for example , @xcite considered robustness of pulses for quantum gate operations in the presence of hamiltonian parameter uncertainty and input field disturbances using an approach based on second order perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite analyzed the hessian curvature of the quantum control landscape for population transfer at its extrema and its effect on robustness of optimal quantum control to field disturbances .",

    "this approach is more accurate than methods for moment calculations ( like ( [ firsttaylor ] ) ) based on leading order taylor expansions .",
    "in addition , following from the analysis of the schrdinger equation ( [ dysonserparam ] ) and their interpretation as quantum pathways as in ( [ amppath ] ) and ( [ dippath ] ) one can determine how input and system parameter uncertainties explicitly affect the dynamical mechanism of controlled dynamics .",
    "given an accurate description of the parameter distribution , its contribution of to each pathway and subsequently the transition amplitude and probability can be determined asymptotically up to a significant dyson order @xmath95 .",
    "analogous to classical robust control @xcite , given the noisy distribution of the input parameters , a measure of robustness can be expressed in terms of the moments of the quantum control objective ( commonly , first and second ) .    however , unlike in the classical control counterpart , there is an interference phenomenon which is responsible for the observed dynamics in a quantum system , since the total transition probability between an initial state @xmath96 and a final state @xmath97 at time @xmath98 can be expressed as : @xmath99      a controller may choose to either arbitrarily specify the maximum dyson order @xmath95 at first and check its accuracy based on the time order expansion of the schrdinger equation , or choose m based on the upper bounds on moment approximation errors . continuing from ( [ amppath ] ) and",

    "s spectral parameters and system s dipole in the dyson series is described in the next subsection .",
    "convergence analysis of the aforementioned moment expressions will be presented in a separate work .",
    "the different quantum pathways defined by ( [ amppath ] ) and ( [ dippath ] ) can be efficiently computed using a commonly used method in signal processing , referred to as _ fourier encoding / decoding_. in fact , due to the complexity of the explicit expressions ( [ amppath ] ) and ( [ dippath ] ) for the quantum pathways , it is convenient to define these pathways in terms of fourier transforms .",
    "the technique was originally implemented to study the mechanism of controlled quantum dynamics @xcite .    in revealing amplitude pathways , a set of fourier functions",
    "are implemented as _ amplitude encoding _ : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the _ modulating frequency _ specific to the amplitude power @xmath32 associated with a particular pathway ( @xmath143 ) . using the modulation ,",

    "we can thus use ( [ encoded ] ) along with ( [ ampencode ] ) and ( [ decon ] ) to concisely define amplitude pathways @xmath143 in ( [ amppath ] ) .",

    "dipole encoding _ would reveal the contribution of the dipole moments in the transition amplitude .",
    "here , each of the dipole matrix elements is encoded with a fourier function : @xmath152 with @xmath153 .",
    "the encoded and propagated unitary propagator consists of the different order dipole pathways with the encoded total transition amplitude : @xmath154 deconvolution of the total transition amplitude leads to the decoded dipole pathway , i.e. @xmath155 .",
    "we can similarly use ( [ dipdecon ] ) along with ( [ dipencode ] ) and ( [ decon ] ) to define dipole pathways in ( [ dippath ] ) .",
    "now that the contribution of the control and system parameters to the different orders of the dyson terms have been delineated , this information together with moments of parameters , can be used to explicitly calculate the effect of manipulated input or system parameter uncertainties on the quantum interferences and transition probability .",
    "the details of the numerical implementation of the method is discussed in the next section .",
    "as noted above , worst - case robustness analysis can also be carried out based on constrained maximization of the distance between the nominal and worst - case values of the performance measure @xcite .",
    "these approaches are based on leading order taylor expansions .",
    "for example , in a first - order formulation , the problem can be expressed as @xmath156 where @xmath65 was defined in ( [ distrib ] ) and @xmath157 in ( [ gradj ] ) ( assuming @xmath84 ) .",
    "if we let @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , then under this change of variables the constrained maximization problem ( [ deviate ] ) is mapped : @xmath160 this problem has the form of a rayleigh quotient @xcite , which has an analytical solution for @xmath1 and @xmath161 , with @xmath162 written in terms of a singular value decomposition with appropriately chosen sign . however , since the formulation is first order , it is subject to the same issues of accuracy noted above .",
    "future work will compare the accuracy of various approaches to estimation of @xmath1 for quantum control systems .",
    "the key to a successful encoding ( and , therefore , decoding ) of quantum pathways is to ensure that the encoding frequency @xmath150 for each pathway is unique .",
    "hence , the choice of @xmath142 directly depends on the pathway definition as given in ( [ amppath ] ) and ( [ dippath ] ) for amplitude and dipole pathways , respectively . for amplitude encoding , assuming that the significant number of dyson terms is @xmath95 , the encoding frequency corresponding to each amplitude mode must be separated by at least m terms . if @xmath163 is encoded with frequency @xmath164 , @xmath165 must be encoded with @xmath166 , and @xmath129 with @xmath167 .",
    "this is to ensure that each amplitude mode @xmath129 with power up to @xmath95 would not have overlapping encoding frequency with the rest of the amplitude modes @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "as described in the previous section , the same set of encoding frequencies can be employed for the case of dipole pathways . again",
    ", if the quantum dynamics is significant up to a dyson order @xmath95 , each transition between the intermediate states of @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be repeated at the most @xmath95 times , such that the dipole moment @xmath169 would have a maximum power of @xmath95 . using this assumption ,",
    "each @xmath170 $ ] must be separated by m terms .",
    "for instance , if @xmath171 is encoded with @xmath172 , then @xmath173 is encoded with @xmath174 and @xmath175 with @xmath176 for @xmath177 $ ] .",
    "this type of encoding assumes that there is connectivity in all of the states within the quantum system ( i.e. @xmath178 for all @xmath179 $ ] ) . for a sparse dipole matrix , it may be more computationally efficient to start with an evenly spaced encoding frequency and subsequently ensure that none of them overlap during the decoding process .",
    "the decoding procedure begins with deconvolution of encoded transition amplitude via fourier transform .",
    "each deconvoluted term is then assigned to the appropriate pathway based on their respective sum of encoding frequencies . as discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "the encoding frequencies are initially chosen so that the @xmath150 s for each pathway belonging to each order are implicitly known .",
    "this means that any pathways associated with @xmath180 are associated with @xmath181 .",
    "using this information , each sum of encoding frequency @xmath150 is _ factorized _ with respect to @xmath164 to reveal all amplitude pathways of all orders , i.e. @xmath182 . the result is a set of amplitude pathways of up to a maximum order @xmath95 .",

    ", the amplitude robustness analysis showed that there exists a set of pathways which are less affected by implementation inaccuracies and thus , more robust . for this analysis , the standard deviations of the second of the three amplitude modes of the control fields listed in table [ controlparam ] are varied while the rest are fixed at 0.3 .",
    "the robustness analysis shows that some combination of amplitude modes and therefore , pathways are more resistant to implementation uncertainty , which in turn minimizes the effect of parameter distribution on destructive interference ( @xmath188 ) relative to its non - robust counterpart ( @xmath189 and @xmath190 ) ( figure [ robustfieldinterfnoi ] ) . as an illustration , figure [ robustfieldnoi ] shows the plot of relatively robust and non - robust control field ( @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively ) and their corresponding control trajectories under nominal and noisy condition .",
    "moreover , given the multiplicities of quantum control solutions , we investigated how stronger fields which utilize more pathways are affected by implementation uncertainties relative to their weaker counterparts .",
    "as seen in ( [ dysser ] ) , fields with high amplitude and longer duration involve more dyson terms and , as a result , more pathways .",
    "this subsequently poses more entry points for control or system parameter uncertainty to affect the control s optimal state trajectory .",
    "to demonstrate this property , we perform optimization of control fields with variable time duration in order to analyze the optimality and robustness of the control as a function of field strength and number of dyson terms involved in the dynamics . the same algorithmic parameters and decision variables as the ones used to obtain control fields listed in table [ controlparam ] applies in this case , but with the amplitude strength across all three modes varied in a range between 0.05 to 0.15 .",
    "ten optimization runs were performed for each amplitude case and the best one is reported in figure [ complexityvsrobustness ] ( left ) . as shown in the plot , fields with higher amplitude are better at maximizing transition probability under nominal conditions but perform worse when implementation uncertainties are present .",
    "this observation is consistent with the interpretation of the robustness analysis , which is that while stronger fields utilize more quantum pathways and therefore results in greater control , these fields may become more susceptible to implementation errors manifests in more pathways ( figure [ complexityvsrobustness ] ( right ) ) .",

    "these results demonstrate that a ) nominally optimal controls are generally not the most robust and do not provide the highest expectation values of controlled observables ; b ) the mechanistic origin of the reduced robustness of nominally optimal controls lies in their use of higher order pathways and associated quantum interferences , which are sensitive to uncertainty . in this regard",

    "the dynamics of controlled quantum system can be described using dyson expansion .",

    "moreover , since quantum pathways interfere with one another in order to produce the observed dynamics , the moment of interference is an essential robustness criteria in the understanding of quantum control robustness .",
    "the robustness analysis method described herein can be implemented in robust control algorithms in a couple of ways .",
    "first , robustness analysis for time - independent hamiltonian uncertainty can be used to compute model - based robust control solutions in an open - loop setting given hamiltonian parameter estimates .",
    "this can in turn be used in conjunction with deterministic robust control algorithms to achieve robust solutions based on either distributional or worst - case criteria , specifically , taking into account quantum pathway interferences and maximizing the performance measure by minimizing the destructive interference .",
    "future work may also compare the mechanisms by which robustness is achieved using the present methodology with those obtained under leading order approximations , for problems with more general types of correlation in equations ( [ fisher ] ) and ( [ freqcorr ] ) .",
    "second , the asymptotic nature of robustness analysis can be used to help determine the number of observations required to obtain accurate estimates of control robustness using experimental sampling of noisy fields in learning control algorithms . these robust open - loop and learning control methods",
    "could ultimately be combined in model - based quantum adaptive feedback control .",
    "finally , these asymptotic methods are also applicable to robustness analysis of other bilinear systems and may prove useful in robust control of such systems .",
