    "<S> while absorption refrigeration which can use heat for cooling , has been known to work already in the early twentieth century , its efficiency was low , it had moving parts and was noisy . </S>",
    "<S> recently cleuren _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ have presented a solid - state ( mesoscopic ) model for a refrigerator operating between two electronic baths held at two different temperatures @xcite , suggesting the sun as a possibility for the third hot bath supplying the required energy . </S>",
    "<S> ( a different optomechanical model was suggested at the same time in ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> this model may well alleviate some of the problems of the absorption refrigerators . </S>",
    "<S> however , they found that in the low - temperature regime the rate at which heat is pumped from the lower - temperature reservoir scales as that bath s temperature . </S>",
    "<S> two comments @xcite , apparently acquiesced by the authors @xcite , challenged the correctness of this spectacular suggestion . both pointing out that it contradicts the  dynamic version \" of the third law which states that no refrigerator can cool a system to absolute zero during a finite time . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that a correct elementary treatment of a simplified model , which is easily generalised to the model of ref . , removes the problem . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> was fine , but its treatment was flawed .     and @xmath0 , and temperatures , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic transport between the two is accomplished via the two localized levels of energies @xmath3 and @xmath4 that are well - coupled ( elastically ) each to its nearby reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the left reservoir is cooled , i.e. , @xmath5 while the electrochemical potentials are identical . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal reservoir ( held at temperature @xmath6 ) supplies the required energy for the transport . , </S>",
    "<S> width=226 ]    we consider the two - level model of ref . , </S>",
    "<S> depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> has two such two - level pairs , whose effects add in the cooling and subtract in the electrical current . </S>",
    "<S> a boson source at a temperature @xmath6 drives current between the left and the right electronic reservoirs through the levels @xmath3 and @xmath7 on the two  quantum dots \" . as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the bias voltage vanishes , i.e. , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the left reservoir is cooled by moving heat to the right one , so that @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the linear - response regime , where all three temperatures are close to the common temperature @xmath9 of the system , which is taken to be low ( the case when @xmath6 is high will be discussed later ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xcite that the boson - assisted hopping is the strongly dominant electronic transport channel . </S>",
    "<S> an electron current may flow between the left and the right reservoirs , but this is irrelevant since no power is involved .    </S>",
    "<S> an electron that exits the left electronic bath at energy @xmath3 , carries heat @xmath10 . to cool that bath we must take @xmath11 . calculating the electric and heat currents emerging from the left bath by the golden rule @xcite , these currents are proportional to the population of @xmath3 ( see eq . ( 7 ) of @xcite ) , which is _ exponentially small _ for @xmath12 hence , the cooling power is exponentially small at low enough temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous condition holds for the two levels @xcite below the common electrochemical potential @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this resolves the serious problem stemming from the fact that the cooling rate was thought to be proportional to the temperature @xmath9 at low t , which contradicted the dynamic version of the third law @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we could have invoked @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , that energy difference is provided by the bosons coming from the thermal bath ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) , necessitating @xmath15 of the order of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we gave the argument using @xmath10 , because this allows the boson reservoir to be very hot ( e.g. 6000@xmath17c @xcite ) as long as the electrons are kept at their temperatures close to t. we can then have linear transport between the left and the right reservoirs , as long as the boson source does not heat them . </S>"
