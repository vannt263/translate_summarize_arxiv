    "in recent years , several models of mostly analytical nature have addressed the question whether binary systems of massive stars without compact objects are liable to produce high - energy @xmath1-ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "note that the regions where the wind of the b star reaches velocities exceeding its terminal velocity of 4000 km s@xmath165 can be explained by the combined radiative acceleration effect of both stars .",
    "it does not have any direct effect on wcr velocities as radiative acceleration is turned off for temperatures above 10@xmath166k due to the fact that line driving does not affect a fully ionized plasma .",

    "[ hydros](d ) shows the shock velocity which is the component of the wind velocity perpendicular to the shock .",

    "the final cut - off at higher energies is due to synchrotron losses . for protons the energy losses by nucleon - nucleon interaction and coulomb losses",
    "do not suffice to overcome the acceleration .",
    "all the cut - offs are caused by the bohm - limit .",

    "[ props](a ) we see a slow and steady decrease with the distance from the apex .",
    "this decrease is caused by the shape of the wcr .",
    "as it curves around the b star , the velocity component along the shock decreases ( even if the absolute wind velocities still increases ) . for distances from the apex",
    "greater than @xmath441200 r@xmath168 the curvature of the shock is less pronounced .",
    "thus , the shock velocity decreases more slowly until it reaches zero at infinity .",
    "[ props](b ) shows the compression ratio @xmath64 .",
    "as expected for a strong shock it remains fairly constant , ranging from 3.8 to 4 . for compression ratios sufficiently above 1",
    ", the dsa - rate ( @xmath169 ) mainly resembles the behaviour of the shock velocity .",
    "the maximum is located at the apex .",
    "acceleration then continuously decreases until far out in the wings .    as the injection rate of new particles",
    "is assumed to be proportional to the density in the acceleration cells , it decreases quickly with growing distance from the apex .",
    "this is shown in fig . [ props](c ) .",
    "the maximum energy attained by the electrons depends on the various loss terms .",
    "ic scattering on photons in the radiation field of the b star is the dominant loss mechanism but it quickly looses relevance further away from the star . as the losses decrease faster than the dsa rate , fig .",
    "[ props](d ) shows increasing maximum electron energies for increasing distances from the apex .",
    "this trend is broken at @xmath44800 r@xmath168 when the electrons reach the bohm - limit and , thus , can not be accelerated any further .",
    "the slight decrease in maximum energy for even larger distances is due to the limit s proportionality to the magnetic field which is decreasing further out . also shown ( in red ) is the maximum energy of the protons which do not suffer any significant losses and attain their maximum energies close to the apex .",
    "[ [ the - b - side - of - the - shock ] ] * the b side of the shock * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as the curvature of the wcr is larger towards the b star s wind close to the star , the shock velocity drops more quickly than on the wr side .",
    "also it is considerably smaller at the apex due to the lower terminal velocity of the b star s wind .",
    "as the shock front flattens out earlier than on the wr side , a lower rate of decrease in @xmath62 is reached already at @xmath44800 r@xmath168 .",
    "again , the compression ratio remains fairly constant , ranging from 3.4 to 4.2 .",
    "minor fluctuations are expected to disappear with more sophisticated methods to determine the post - shock mass density and higher spatial resolutions .",
    "in general , the low level of variation in compression ratio along both shock fronts serves as confirmation that the generic assumption of fixing the @xmath64 to 4 is warranted for the kind of cwb system investigated .",
    "[ props](c ) shows that the injection rate for the b side of the shock close to the apex is even larger than for the shock towards the high mass - loss wr wind .",
    "this is due to higher densities of the b wind in the proximity of the star .",
    "however , the steeper decrease in density soon overcomes the initially higher value .",
    "further out , the injection ratio in the shock towards the b wind is up to an order of magnitude lower compared to the wr side of the shock .",
    "[ props](d ) reveals that the lower acceleration rate ( due to lower @xmath62 and @xmath64 ) and higher loss rates ( due to the proximity of the b star ) prevent the electrons on the b side of the shock to reach energies up to the bohm limit until far out in the wings .",
    "the protons are again not affected by any significant losses .",
    "having discussed the varying conditions along the shock , we now explore the resulting distribution functions of high - energy particles throughout the computational domain .",
    "we show particle distribution functions in the orbital plane for various energies as well as spectra for several selected positions .      the electron distribution function for 6 different energies from 1 mev to 1 tev in the orbital plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ els ] .",
    "as expected , number densities drop quickly towards higher energies .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the highest energies are to be found in the wings of the wcr , close to the shock towards the wr star .",
    "this can be understood by considering that this is a region where radiative losses are low and the shock is strong , as the component of the wind velocity perpendicular to the wr side of the shock is still significant .",
    "note that electrons at 10 gev and higher can no longer penetrate into the center regions of the wcr due to severe radiation losses .",
    "they are confined to the proximity of the shock fronts .",
    "this behaviour closely resembles the schematic diagrams of the relativistic electron distribution in @xcite .    to allow a deeper understanding of the electron distribution function , fig .",
    "[ elspec ] shows a selection of spectra for different positions .",
    "[ elspec](a ) shows spectra along the apex of the wcr along the x - axis from right to left .",
    "the spectra at the shock fronts ( solid and double - dot  dashed ) are marked in red . as was shown above ,",
    "the compression ratio at the wr side of the shock is close to 4 which yields a power law index of -2 .",
    "therefore , in e@xmath170n scaling , we obtain a nearly flat spectrum with a cut - off where ic and synchrotron losses overcome the acceleration ( red solid line ) . moving further into the wcr along the line connecting both stars we find higher electron densities than at the shock",
    "( black dashed line ) .",
    "this is caused by a pile - up of particles in the area behind the shock front which occurs due to very low fluid velocities in this region . as the spatial convection flux increases with number density ,",
    "the cells behind the shock reach equilibrium between incoming and outgoing particles only at a certain number density which is generally higher than in the shock itself .",
    "further to the center of the wcr ( black dotted line ) , losses by cooling ( which are larger at higher energies ) become important .",
    "the spectra now shows two components , the one stemming from the b side of the shock with energies up to @xmath44 1 gev , the other stemming from the wr side with energies up to @xmath44 10 gev .",
    "still closer to the b shock ( black dash - dotted line ) the latter component is further subdued as cooling and advection in both downstream directions remove more and more particles stemming from the wr side of the shock . at the b shock ( red double dot - dashed line ) , a lower compression ratio ( @xmath171 ) yields a slightly softer spectral index @xmath172 .",
    "radiative losses cause the change of slope and the eventual cut - off which is at a lower energy than on the other side of the wcr due to the increased proximity of the b star .",
    "[ elspec](b ) shows spectra for several regions along the wr side of the shock front .",
    "in contrast to the spectra along the apex , it shows dramatic changes in maximum energy as loss rates decrease significantly with growing distance . whereas it is still the ic losses that produce the cut - off close to the apex ( solid and dashed line ) , the highest energies of the spectra further out are determined by the bohm limit .",
    "however , the influence of the radiative losses can still be seen in the change of slope ( dash - dotted and double - dot dashed line ) , very similar to the cases discussed in section [ cons ] .",
    "a varying compression ratio leads to slight variations of the spectral index .",
    "note that none of the spectra reaches energies @xmath1731 tev .",
    "the spectra corresponding to the b side of the shock are shown in fig .",
    "[ elspec](c ) .",
    "we again see the expected increase in maximum energy as one moves towards the wings of the wcr .",
    "as radiative losses have a stronger impact on the b side of the shock , the bohm limit is not reached except for a distance of @xmath442000 r@xmath168 from the apex .",
    "additional features relate to slight variations in the compression ratio and to the decreasing injection rates as the wind plasma density decreases outwards .    finally , fig .",
    "[ elspec](d ) explores the spectra along the line that is equidistant to the two shock fronts .",
    "it shows a mixture of previously noticed effects .",
    "the absence of electrons above @xmath441 gev is due the fact that particles at those energies are produced at the shock front only at considerable distance from the apex .",
    "they do not have sufficient time to propagate into the center of the wcr before leaving the simulated region .",
    "thus , the majority of the particles in this center region stem from close to the apex of the wcr .",
    "[ prs ] and [ prspec ] are analogous to fig .",
    "[ els ] and [ elspec ] for the case of protons .",
    "radiative losses are hardly significant and thus , the number density of protons depends mostly on the injection rate ( which is proportional to the local wind plasma density ) than on the distance to the stars .",
    "as radiative losses are of lesser importance , protons can reach energies of several tev .",
    "[ prs ] illustrates that , in contrast to electrons , the highest energy protons are to be found near the shock towards the b star where a stronger magnetic field strength shifts the bohm - cut - off towards higher energies .",
    "further details can be seen from the spectra in fig .",
    "[ prspec ] ( a ) to ( d ) . along the apex",
    ", we see again a pile - up behind the shock , as an equilibrium between the particle transport downstream by spatial convection and the flow of new particles from the shock by the diffusion term is not reached until high number densities are attained . further away from the wr shock towards the center of the wcr",
    ", particles are increasingly transported downstream .",
    "the influence of the second shock front towards the b star emerges as the spectral index changes accordingly .",
    "there , a lower compression ratio yields a softer spectrum .    comparing spectra along the both shock fronts ( fig .",
    "[ prspec](b ) and ( c ) ) , one can see various effects : the softening of the spectra with decreasing compression ratio , the decrease of the injection rate with decreasing mass density of the wind , and the slight decrease of the bohm - limit with increasing distance from the apex .",
    "the latter explains why protons above 1 tev are found near the center , but not in the wings of the wcr facing the wr star",
    ". finally , fig .",
    "[ prspec](d ) shows spectra along the center of the wcr which again are determined by the particle densities close to the apex .",
    "in addition to the previous findings discussed above , our simulations show that the orbital motion of a binary system has the potential to significantly alter the distribution of high - energy particles .",
    "as was described in section [ geom ] , our code is capable of moving the stars on a keplerian orbit . in the present study",
    ", we merely investigate the circular case . by including orbital motion into our simulation and letting the system evolve for @xmath441.3 orbital periods , we obtain results as in fig .",
    "[ elsrot ] . for the given stellar masses and their distance",
    ", a keplerian orbit has a period of @xmath44820 days .",
    "the orbital velocity of the stars is @xmath4445 km s@xmath165 which is two orders of magnitude below the terminal velocity of the winds .    with orbital motion ,",
    "the two arms of the wcr develop considerable differences .",
    "the effect becomes most notable at 10  gev , where we see a contrast in differential number densities of @xmath442 orders of magnitude between the leading and trailing arm on the b side of the wcr for electrons .",
    "this is due to the early cut - off of the trailing arm an energy of @xmath4410  gev . only in the leading arm , energies above 100 gev",
    "are reached for the electrons along the shock towards the b star .",
    "for the wr side of the shock , maximum electron energies are reached in the trailing arm .",
    "these differences stem to the greatest part from the deformation of the wcr due to orbital motion .",
    "it is no longer symmetric with respect to the apex .",
    "[ orbitspec](a ) illustrates the effect of these geometrical differences .",
    "the fraction of shock velocity versus absolute wind velocity is shown as a fraction of the distance from the apex along the shock front on the b side of the shock .",
    "the wind velocity component perpendicular to the shock is significantly larger along the forward arm .",
    "the ensuing difference in shock velocity has a significant impact as the acceleration rate is proportional to @xmath174 .",
    "[ orbitspec](b ) shows the electron spectra for two characteristic positions in the forward arm and in the trailing arm of the wcr close to the shock towards the b star . the lower shock velocity in the case of the latter causes a cut - off due to ic losses at @xmath44 10 gev . in case of the forward arm ,",
    "the acceleration is able to compete with the losses up to higher energies .",
    "comparatively larger effects are expected for elliptical orbits in which changing stellar separation causes more severe contrasts in a large number of relevant properties , as plasma density , radiation energy density , shock velocity , etc . in this work",
    ", we do not yet explore the effects of varying stellar separation .",
    "however , the significant differences between forward and trailing arm clearly indicate that orbital motion can have a strong influence in a model of the wcr and the particle transport within .",
    "we have demonstrated the feasibility of numerically solving the time - dependent transport equation of high - energy particles within a 3d hydrodynamic model of the stellar winds and their collision region for a massive star binary system .",
    "this approach provides a more realistic description of the energetic particle spectra compared to analytical models with inherent simplifications regarding the complex structure of the wcr and the dynamics of the wind interaction .    for a typical cwb system of a wr and a b star where the wcr is much closer to the latter ( e.g. , @xmath0=0.1 )",
    ", we simulated the radiatively driven wind plasma and its collision region .",
    "on the basis of the hd description of the wind , the geometry of the wcr and following the propagation of accelerating electrons and protons in the relativistic domain , we derived relevant quantities related to particle acceleration such as shock velocity , compression ratio , maximum possible particle injection rate and maximum attainable energies along the two shock fronts .",
    "all of these exemplify notable differences between the b side and wr side of the shock and also between the inner ( apex ) and outer part ( wings ) of the wcr .",
    "the geometrical structure of the wcr critically influences the shock velocity and , consequently , the maximum energy of electrons accelerated in the shock .",
    "varying wind densities along the shocks affect the highest possible rate of particles injected at the shock .",
    "we find a decrease in the shock velocity with growing distance from the apex that differs corresponding to the dissimilar curvature and wind velocities at both sides of the wcr . by determining the compression ratio at the shock fronts directly from the mass densities provided by the hd simulation , we obtain values around @xmath44 4 .",
    "this corresponds well to the generic assumption of @xmath154 for strong shocks .",
    "particle injection rates are largest close to the apex towards the b star due to its proximity . further away from the apex",
    ", the denser wr wind produces a higher possible injection rate .    by solving a transport equation within the entire computational domain",
    ", we obtained spectra of high - energy particles throughout the wcr . for electrons",
    ", we have shown that maximum energies are attained in the wings of the wcr where losses by ic scattering and synchrotron emission are significantly lower than at the apex due to the distance from the stars .",
    "typically , spectra with indices between 1.9 and 2.2 are obtained .",
    "since protons are less affected by energy loss mechanisms , their spectra show a cut - off determined by the bohm limit .",
    "varying indices and injection rates similarly relate to the wind properties and the geometry of the wcr . by studying spectra of high - energy particles in between the two shock fronts , we also provided insight into the evolution of particles after leaving the shock front on their journey downstream along the wcr .",
    "in addition , we demonstrated the importance of orbital motion which has considerable impact on the high - energy particle spectra .",
    "even slight changes in the geometry of the wcr can cause contrasts in the number density of particles and critically influence their maximum energies .",
    "on the basis of the approach we presented , several applications and future developments become feasible . concerning cwbs , the next consequent step is to derive the photon emission along given line  of  sights on the basis of our electron and nucleon spectra .",
    "the calculation of ( anisotropic ) ic , bremsstrahlung and neutral @xmath175-decay components of the total non - thermal photon flux can be done directly from the simulated particle population and will be presented in a subsequent paper . in addition , we will study the integrated flux value as a function of the stellar separation along the orbital period and as a function of time . the application of this code to specific binary systems ( e.g. wr 140 ) that remain undetected at @xmath1-ray energies can provide limits on the fraction of injected electrons ( which is an important free parameter in respective models ) .",
    "dependencies of the @xmath1-ray emission on other parameters , such as the magnetic field , can also be studied in detail .",
    "future developments of the presented code include the consideration of additional physical processes , e.g. @xmath1-@xmath1 absorption close to the wcr .",
    "the transition from a hd to a mhd description of the wind plasma holds promise to provide a self - consistent magnetic field model at the wcr that only depends on the magnetic field models of the stars .",
    "the consideration of an increasing variety of aspects might eventually provide an explanation , why all cwbs except @xmath0  carinae remain undetected at high - energy @xmath1 rays so far .",
    "one critical factor that is now accessible to simulations is the dependence of particle evolution on the dynamics of the wcr , as it dramatically changes during the orbital period of high - eccentricity binary systems .",
    "close to the periastron passage , especially strong cooling and strong velocity gradients produce very unstable conditions ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that could have a strong influence on the resulting particle distributions and non - thermal emission processes .",
