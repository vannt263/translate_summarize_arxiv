    "considerable evidence points to a universe that is accelerating @xcite .",
    "although the cosmological constant @xmath1 provides conceptually the simplest explanation of cosmic acceleration , its enigmatically small value has led researchers to explore alternative avenues for generating an accelerating universe @xcite . in this paper , we shall confine our attention to brane cosmology described by the fairly general action @xcite @xmath2 + \\int_{\\rm brane } \\left ( m^2 r - 2 \\sigma \\right ) + \\int_{\\rm brane } l \\left ( h_{ab } , \\phi \\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath4 in the five - dimensional bulk , and @xmath5 is the scalar curvature of the induced metric @xmath6 on the brane . the brane is considered to be a boundary of the bulk space , @xmath7 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor of the brane , and @xmath8 denotes the lagrangian density of the four - dimensional matter fields @xmath9 whose dynamics is restricted to the brane . @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote , respectively , the five - dimensional and four - dimensional planck masses , @xmath12 is the five - dimensional ( bulk ) cosmological constant , and @xmath13 is the brane tension .",
    "action ( [ action ] ) leads to the following cosmological evolution equation on the brane @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 if the extra dimension is space - like , and @xmath16 if it is time - like , @xmath17 is an integration constant reflecting the presence of a black hole in the bulk space , the term @xmath18 is usually called ` dark radiation , ' and @xmath19 reflects the spatial curvature of the brane .",
    "several important cosmological scenarios arise as special cases of ( [ cosmo ] ) , including :    1 .",
    "general relativity ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , 2 .   the self - accelerating dvali  gabadadze",
    " porrati ( dgp ) brane @xcite ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , 3 .   the randall  sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite ( @xmath23 ) .    indeed ,",
    "action ( [ action ] ) can result in cosmological models which differ from gr either _ early on _ or at _ late times_. the randall  sundrum model belongs to the former class whereas the dgp brane is a famous example of the latter category .",
    "other interesting properties of models with late - time acceleration include phantom expansion @xcite , loitering @xcite and cosmic mimicry @xcite , all of which shall be briefly discussed in this paper .",
    "an intriguing question faced by cosmologists is why the universe accelerates twice : during inflation and again at the present epoch .",
    "the notion of quintessential inflation  attempting to unify early and late acceleration  was originally suggested in the context of gr by peebles and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "the possibility that braneworld models could provide a more efficient realisation of this scenario was discussed in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath24 in the randall  sundrum model , so that ( [ cosmo ] ) reduces to @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "a scalar field evolving on the brane satisfies the usual equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is given by ( [ eq : brane ] ) , and the energy density and pressure of the scalar field are , respectively , @xmath30 if @xmath31 , then the new term @xmath32 in ( [ eq : brane ] ) _ increases _ the damping experienced by the scalar field as it rolls down its potential , making the inflationary condition @xmath33 easier to achieve .",
    "consequently , inflation can be driven by _ steep potentials _ , such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , which are usually associated with dark energy ( de ) @xcite .",
    "thus the class of potentials giving rise to inflation increases and the possibility of realising inflation becomes easier in brane cosmology @xcite .",
    "brane inflation leaves behind an imprint on the cosmological gravity - wave background by increasing its amplitude and creating a distinct ` blue tilt ' in its spectrum , thereby permitting verification through future lisa - type searches @xcite .",
    "if , in the randall  sundrum model , the extra dimension is _ time - like _ , then the big - bang singularity is completely absent ! to see this , consider equation ( [ cosmo ] ) , this time with @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting braneworld dynamics is described by @xcite @xmath36 where we have ignored the contribution from @xmath1 and dark radiation . since the ` @xmath37 ' sign within the bracket in ( [ cosmo ] ) is replaced by a ` @xmath38 ' sign , this braneworld model can be regarded as dual to the rs model @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath39 when @xmath40 , i.e. , the universe _ bounces _ when the density of matter has reached a sufficiently large value .",
    "note that the singularity - free nature of the early universe is _ generic _ and does not depend upon whether or not matter violates the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "this scenario has also been used to construct cyclic models of the universe @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite dark energy is postulated to be a phantom having @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , its energy density _ grows as the universe expands _",
    ", @xmath42 , while the density of normal matter / radiation decreases .",
    "since @xmath43 grows at small _ as well as _",
    "large values of the expansion factor , the hubble parameter passes through zero twice : ( i ) at early times when the bounce in ( [ eq : bounce ] ) is caused by the large radiation density and ( ii ) during late times , when the large value of the phantom density leads to @xmath44 in ( [ eq : bounce ] ) and initiates the universe s recollapse .",
    "the universe can also recollapse if it is spatially closed or if dark energy falls to negative values , as in the case of de with a cosine potential @xcite . in the braneworld context , such models will also be ` cyclic ' in the sense that they will pass through an infinite number of nonsingular expanding - contracting epochs @xcite .",
    "the previous examples showed how brane cosmology could differ from that in gr at _",
    "early times_. we now demonstrate that the same can happen at late times .",
    "the cosmological equation ( [ cosmo ] ) can be expressed in the following way in a spatially flat braneworld @xcite : [ hubble ] h^2 ( a ) & = & + _ eff , + [ eq : screening ] _ eff & = & ( b + ) , where @xmath45 the two branches of solutions , designated by the @xmath46 sign in ( [ eq : screening ] ) , correspond to two possible ways of embedding the brane in the bulk space @xcite .",
    "consider the branch with the ` @xmath38 ' sign , which we allude to as brane1 .",
    "since , in this case , the second term in ( [ eq : screening ] ) decreases with time , the value of the effective cosmological constant @xmath47 _ increases _ @xcite .",
    "therefore , the braneworld expansion proceeds as that of a universe which is described by general relativity and filled with phantom ( @xmath48 ) , but , unlike phantom , matter on the brane does not violate the weak energy condition @xmath49 .",
    "from ( [ eq : screening ] ) it is also clear that the universe evolves to @xmath1cdm in the future and does not encounter a _ big rip _ singularity peculiar to phantom de @xcite .",
    "the fact that the braneworld model ( [ hubble ] ) , ( [ eq : screening ] ) can give rise to phantom - like behaviour can also be seen if we rewrite it in terms of the cosmological redshift @xmath50 , neglecting the dark - radiation term @xmath51 , so that @xcite [ hubble1 ] = _ m ( 1+z)^3 + _ + 2 _ 2 , where [ omegas ] _",
    "m = , _ = , _ = , _ _ b = - . the current value of the effective equation of state is given by @xcite @xmath52 from which we see that @xmath53 for brane1 , described by the lower sign option in ( [ eq : brane_state ] ) .",
    "( the second choice of embedding , brane2 , gives @xmath54 . )",
    "it is important to note that all brane1 models have @xmath55 and @xmath56 at @xmath57 and successfully cross the ` phantom divide ' at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "note that the de equation of state in modified gravity models is notional and not physical @xcite and for this reason the statefinder and the @xmath59 diagnostic @xcite provide a more comprehensive picture of cosmic acceleration in such models .",
    "a very interesting braneworld model , suggested by dvali , gabadadze and poratti @xcite , is based on action ( [ action ] ) with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the spatially flat _ self - accelerating _ dgp brane without dark radiation is described by [ eq : dgp ] h = +  . in this case",
    ", the universe accelerates because gravity becomes five - dimensional on length scales @xmath60 . comparing ( [ eq : dgp ] ) with the corresponding expression for lcdm [ h - lcdm ] h",
    "=  , we find that the cosmological constant @xmath1 is replaced by a new fundamental constant @xmath10 in the dgp model . however , unlike @xmath1 , the value of @xmath10 is not unnaturally small . indeed",
    ", @xmath61mev can give rise to a universe which accelerates today with @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "while providing an interesting alternative to dark energy , the dgp model does not agree with observations as well as lcdm @xcite .",
    "but the biggest stumbling block for this model appears to be theoretical and has to do with the existence of a ghost on the self - accelerating branch of solutions , which poses grave difficulties for the dgp gravity ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a new feature of brane cosmology described by ( [ hubble1 ] ) is the presence of singularities at which the density , pressure and hubble parameter remain finite while the deceleration parameter diverges @xcite .",
    "then these _ quiescent _ singularities arise when the inequality @xmath63 is satisfied , in which case the expression under the square root of ( [ hubble1 ] ) becomes zero at a suitably late time and the cosmological solution _ can not be extended beyond this point_. ( the quiescent singularity is the result of a singular embedding of the brane in the bulk @xcite . )    the limiting redshift , @xmath64 , at which the braneworld becomes singular is given by @xmath65^{1/3 } - 1 \\ , .\\ ] ] and one easily finds that , while the hubble parameter remains finite , @xmath66 the deceleration parameter becomes singular as @xmath67 is approached .",
    "the difference between the relatively mild _ quiescent _ singularities and the more spectacular _ big rip _ singularities of phantom cosmology @xcite should be noted .",
    "the latter are much more violent since the density , pressure and all derivatives of the hubble parameter diverge at the _ big rip _ ; see also @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath68 in ( [ hubble1 ] ) leads to transient acceleration : the current acceleration of the universe is a _ transient phenomenon _ sandwiched between two matter - dominated regimes @xcite .",
    "the braneworld model in ( [ hubble1 ] ) has yet another remarkable property . for large values of the brane tension @xmath69 and the ( bulk ) cosmological constant @xmath70 , and at redshifts lower than the _ mimicry _ redshift ( 1+z_)^3 = , [ eq : new1 ] the expansion rate ( [ hubble1 ] ) on the brane reduces to that in lcdm @xcite ^lcdm_m ( 1+z)^3 + 1 - ^lcdm_m , [ eq : lcdm ] where [ lcdm ] ^lcdm_m = _ m , = .",
    "@xmath71 \\epsfxsize=3.0 in \\psfig{figure = b1.ps , width=0.45\\textwidth , angle=-90 } & \\epsfxsize=3.0 in \\psfig{figure = b2.ps , width=0.45\\textwidth , angle=-90 } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    this property is dubbed _ cosmic mimicry _ for the following reasons :    * a brane1 model , which at high redshifts expands with density parameter @xmath72 , at lower redshifts _ masquerades as a lcdm universe _ with a _ smaller value _ of the density parameter . in other words , at low redshifts , the brane1 universe expands as the lcdm model ( [ eq : lcdm ] ) with @xmath73 [ where @xmath74 is determined by ( [ lcdm ] ) with the lower ( `` @xmath37 '' ) sign ] . * a brane2 model at low redshifts",
    "also masquerades as lcdm but with a _ larger value _ of the density parameter .",
    "in this case , @xmath75 with @xmath74 being determined by ( [ lcdm ] ) with the upper ( `` @xmath38 '' ) sign .",
    "cosmic mimicry is illustrated in figure  [ fig : mimicry ] .",
    "@xmath76 \\epsfxsize=2.7 in \\epsffile{loiter1.epsi } & \\epsfxsize=2.7 in \\epsffile{loiter2.epsi } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    an interesting aspect of the braneworld models ( [ hubble ] ) , ( [ eq : screening ] ) is that they can _ loiter _ @xcite .",
    "loitering is characterized by the fact that the hubble parameter dips in value over a narrow redshift range referred to as the ` loitering epoch ' @xcite . in the model under consideration , it can occur even in a spatially flat or open universe and is ensured by the presence of the dark - radiation term @xmath51 in ( [ eq : screening ] ) . during loitering ,",
    "density perturbations are expected to grow rapidly and , since the expansion of the universe slows down , its age increases @xcite .",
    "an epoch of loitering may , therefore , be expected to boost the formation of high - redshift gravitationally bound systems including black holes and/or population iii stars ; see figure  [ fig : loiter ] .",
