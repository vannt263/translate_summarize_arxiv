    "one of the major discoveries at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite is that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) behaves like a  perfect liquid \" @xcite , which attracts much theoretical interest in various fields .",
    "hydrodynamic modeling of heavy ion collisions plays an important role in deducing the above fact @xcite .",
    "anisotropy of radial flow , namely elliptic flow @xcite , is found to be large in au+au and cu+cu collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow is quantified by the second harmonics of azimuthal angle distribution , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one reproduces the centrality , pseudorapidity , and transverse momentum dependences of @xmath1 data reasonably well by employing the glauber type initial conditions and implementing hadronic dissipative effects in ideal hydrodynamic models @xcite .",
    "however , when one replaces initial conditions from the glauber model to the ones from a model based on the color glass condensate , elliptic flow coefficients overshoot the experimental data due to eccentricity larger than that from the conventional glauber model calculations @xcite . given a fact that the initial conditions in relativistic heavy ion collisions are not known precisely , the discrepancy strongly suggests effects of viscosities in the qgp phase are required to reproduce the @xmath1 data in this particular case .",
    "even though ideal hydrodynamic models have been successful in reproduction of the @xmath1 data , the next important tasks are to constrain the transport coefficients by comparison of theoretical predictions with the experimental data and to comprehensively understand the transport properties of the qgp .",
    "shear viscosity has already been taken into account in several hydrodynamic simulations to investigate its effect on elliptic flow in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , few studies are done so far to investigate the effect of bulk viscosity in dynamical simulations of relativistic viscous fluids @xcite .",
    "many years ago , it was found that the bulk viscous coefficient @xmath2 has a prominent peak in the vicinity of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transition due to reduction of the sound velocity @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of bulk viscosity is realized again in the context of violation of scale invariance in qcd @xcite . the smallness of the sound velocity is intimately related with violation of scale invariance .",
    "so it would be a universal feature that the bulk viscous coefficient becomes large around the critical region . from a phenomenological point of view , large bulk viscosity could trigger a violation of applicability of hydrodynamic framework around ( pseudo-)critical temperature @xcite and support the success of hybrid approaches @xcite in which the hydrodynamic description of the qgp is followed by the kinetic description of the hadron gas .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the effects of bulk viscosity in the late stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions . to demonstrate them",
    ", we calculate transverse momentum spectra and differential elliptic flow coefficient . in ideal hydrodynamic calculations , the cooper - frye formula @xcite",
    "is conventionally employed to calculate the particle spectra at freezeout . in the hybrid calculations",
    ", it plays a role in transition of description from macroscopic hydrodynamics to microscopic hadronic cascade models . in both cases ,",
    "the cooper - frye formula is indispensable in comparison of hydrodynamic results with experimental data . in dissipative hydrodynamics ,",
    "viscous effects are taken into account in the cooper - frye formula in two ways : one is a variation of flow profile as a matter of viscous correction to the dynamical evolution , the other is distortion of phase space distribution from its equilibrium form . so far , no full three dimensional viscous hydrodynamic simulations are available .",
    "given this situation , we take flow profile from a full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic simulation @xcite assuming variation of it due to viscosity is not significant .",
    "we estimate the correction from bulk viscosity as well as from shear viscosity to the distribution function by matching macroscopic quantities with the ones calculated in the kinetic theory and see how this affects transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) spectra and transverse momentum dependence of elliptic flow coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we give a brief overview on the relativistic kinetic theory by putting emphasizes on subtle issues in its application to relativistic multi - component gases and to the ones with zero ( net - baryon ) number density limit . in sec .  [ sec3 ] , we focus on a hadron resonance gas model , which is widely exploited in hydrodynamic analyses of relativistic heavy ion collisions , and introduce a simple model for shear and bulk viscous coefficients .",
    "we demonstrate the effects of bulk viscosity at freezeout is possibly large by calculating the prefactors in correction of distribution functions . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we calculate @xmath3-spectra and @xmath4 by taking flow profiles from three cases : ( 1 ) bjorken flow , ( 2 ) a blast wave model , and ( 3 ) a full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is devoted to conclusion .",
    "we would like to express viscous corrections to the phase space distribution for a relativistic multi - component gas in terms of macroscopic variables by matching the macroscopic variables with the ones obtained from the kinetic theory .",
    "this is a generalization of the treatment developed by israel and stewart @xcite for a single component system to a multi - component system .",
    "we will see that some non - trivial facts arise when a multi - component gas is considered .",
    "firstly , one usually considers a scalar term , a vector term , and a traceless tensor term for a momentum expansion of the non - equilibrium part of the distribution and assumes that the trace part of the tensor term can be absorbed in the scalar term .",
    "however , this is no longer the case for a multi - component system , because the equivalence of the scalar term and the trace part holds only in a single component gas .",
    "secondly , the number of equations which determines the modification of the distribution does not change upon taking a zero net baryon density limit .",
    "this means we do not have to suffer the loss of conditions to obtain the unique expression of the distortion , nor do we need to resort to the quadratic ansatz @xcite .",
    "consideration of the limit is of practical importance since the limit is often employed in hydrodynamic models of the hot qcd matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "tensor decompositions of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5 and the net baryon number current @xmath6 give the definitions of the macroscopic variables .",
    "the decomposed terms are put into the equilibrium part and the non - equilibrium part : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 the time - like and space - like projection operators are , respectively , defined as @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the minkowski metric @xmath13 .",
    "we also define the dot product as @xmath14 .",
    "the round brackets stand for symmetrization , @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denote the energy density , the hydrostatic pressure , and the charge density , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the energy current , @xmath20 the charge current , @xmath21 the bulk pressure , and @xmath22 t^{\\alpha \\beta } $ ] the shear stress tensor .",
    "generally @xmath23 and @xmath24 would have dissipative counterparts @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but such terms are not considered here because we employ the landau matching conditions which demand @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these conditions are necessary to make the system thermodynamically stable in the first order theory .",
    "we will see the details later . for reviews on relativistic viscous hydrodynamics , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "kinetic theory demands for a system with multi - species particles @xmath29 the label @xmath30 denotes a particle species . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the degeneracy and the baryon number .",
    "we define @xmath33 to be the deviation of the distribution function from its equilibrium form , @xmath34^{-1 } = ( \\exp{y_0 } - \\epsilon ) ^{-1}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath35 for bosons and @xmath36 for fermions . @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the temperature and the baryon chemical potential .",
    "now we expand @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 up to the second order in momentum and estimate viscous corrections to the distribution function in the grad s 14-moment method @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are coefficients of the expansion .",
    "the numbers of unknown variables are 4 and 10 , respectively , because the latter should be symmetric since any anti - symmetric term cancels out upon taking contraction with @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath43 is often considered to be traceless and the scalar term @xmath45 is introduced instead @xcite .",
    "the apparent lack of the scalar term in the expression ( [ eq : df ] ) is due to the fact that we set the tensor term @xmath46 to have a non - zero trace .",
    "the numbers of unknown variables are the same in both cases .",
    "if we consider a single component system such as a pion gas , the trace part of the tensor term is equivalent to a scalar term @xmath45 since the trace part can be separated as @xmath47 and the metric produces a scalar @xmath48 .    however , this is not the case for a multi - component system because all the viscous correction tensors @xmath45 , @xmath49 , and @xmath46 are macroscopic quantities in the sense that they do not depend on any particular particle species . on the other hand ,",
    "the trace part has mass dependence , which means it is particle - species dependent : @xmath50 \\notag \\\\ \\label{eq : scalar_trace } & = & - f_0^i ( 1+\\epsilon f_0^i ) \\bigg [ \\frac{\\mathrm{tr } ( \\varepsilon _ { \\mu \\nu } ) m_i^2 } { 4 } + p_i^\\mu p_i^\\nu \\tilde{\\varepsilon } _ { \\mu \\nu } \\bigg ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 is a traceless tensor .",
    "the equivalence of the scalar term and the trace term holds for a single component system because we can set a variable @xmath52 to be @xmath53 . since the same prescription does not work for a multi - component gas where we have the additional index @xmath30 ,",
    "it is problematic whether to consider a non - zero trace tensor term , or the combination of a scalar term and a traceless tensor term in a system of multi - species particles .",
    "we will see in the next section that only the former is relevant in the case of a 16-component hadron resonance gas .",
    "our aim here is to uniquely determine the explicit forms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", we introduce the landau matching conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which ensure the thermodynamic stability in the first order theory ( see appendix [ lmc ] for further details ) .",

    "( [ eq : energy - momentum ] ) and ( [ eq : number ] ) .    the landau matching condition for the energy - momentum tensor",
    "is simplified by using the expressions defined above : @xmath65 from now on we employ the notations @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the other conditions can be expressed in a similar fashion : @xmath70 the conditions ( [ eq : lce1])-([eq : sc1 ] ) are classified into three independent sets of equations : ( a ) the definition of the bulk pressure and the landau matching conditions for the scalars @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , ( b ) the definitions of the energy current and the charge current for the vectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and ( c ) the definition of the shear stress tensor for the tensor @xmath76 . the equations are immediately solved for each group : @xmath77 where the prefactors @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eqs .",

    "the prefactors are explicitly expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 the prefactor for the shear stress tensor ( [ eq : b2 ] ) has the same form as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas those for the bulk pressure ( [ eq : d0])-([eq : b0tilde ] ) are different from the ones in the reference because the finite trace tensor term is considered instead of the scalar term .",
    "of course , those reduce to the same formulas in a single component gas .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , if we define the heat current @xmath84 as @xmath85 eqs .",
    "( [ d1s ] ) and ( [ b1s ] ) can be expressed as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "some comments are in order here .",
    "firstly , we give a consideration to the special case where the landau frame , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath88 and the zero net baryon density limit @xmath89 are employed .",
    "these are often taken for hydrodynamic analyses of the qgp in relativistic heavy ion collisions because the numbers of baryons and anti - baryons are roughly the same for such events . in our framework , they correspond to estimating only the contributions of the shear viscosity and the bulk viscosity .",
    "apparently the landau condition of the charge current ( [ eq : lcn1 ] ) vanishes upon taking the limit because @xmath64 does .",
    "this could induce an ambiguity because the number of conditions for the determination of the prefactors decreases .",
    "but if we expand @xmath64 around the baryon chemical potential @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 then eq . ( [ eq : lcn1 ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath92 _ { \\mu _ b = 0 } = 0,\\ ] ] which remains finite in the zero baryon density limit .",
    "this enables us to determine the prefactors for the bulk pressure uniquely even after the limit is taken .",
    "secondly , we discuss the validity of the quadratic ansatz in the distortion of the distribution .",
    "if one makes the quadratic ansatz , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath93 @xcite , then it violates the landau conditions because @xmath94 therefore , one should not make the ansatz if one employs the landau matching conditions in hydrodynamic equations . note that , in the quadratic ansatz , @xmath95 s in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lce1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lcn1 ] ) vanish since @xmath46 is perpendicular to @xmath11 in this ansatz .",
    "also the correction from bulk viscosity is naively expected to be smaller than that of shear viscosity , because @xmath96 holds .",
    "thirdly , it is important to explicitly consider a multi - component system for estimations of the viscous corrections eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d0])-([eq : b2 ] ) because the deviation of the distribution for the @xmath30-th particle species @xmath97 generally depends on whether it is the only component or one of the components in a multi - component gas .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath60 s , and thus the prefactors , include information of all particle species like thermodynamic variables .",
    "it should be noted that the difference becomes negligible if one treats the first order theory and assume that the shear viscosity @xmath98 is proportional to the entropy density @xmath99 , because in the boltzmann approximation we have @xmath100 here we used the relation @xmath101 in the boltzmann approximation @xcite .",
    "we see that @xmath102 is a function dependent on the index @xmath30 and the temperature but independent of what other components are in the gas .",
    "following the discussion in the previous section , we estimate the thermodynamic quantities and the prefactors appearing in @xmath56 . as the model of the equation of state",
    ", we consider the 16-component hadron resonance gas , which has mesons and baryons with mass up to @xmath103 .",
    "hereafter we take the landau frame and set the system to be baryon free .",
    "the models for the shear viscosity @xmath98 and the bulk viscosity @xmath2 are taken from refs . @xcite and @xcite : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the sound velocity .",
    "the factor @xmath106 in the bulk viscosity is set to 15 unless there is further notification .",
    "figure [ fig : viscosity ] shows temperature dependence of @xmath107 and @xmath108 for a hadronic resonance gas model . in the temperature range relevant to relativistic heavy ion collisions @xmath109 gev , @xmath108 is several factors smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "so one might expect that the effect of the bulk viscosity is small .",
    "this is not necessarily true since the corrections in @xmath56 appear as a combination of transport coefficients and the prefactors discussed later .",

    "this is because , if we choose the combination of the scalar term and the traceless tensor term , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 diverge due to a change of the sign in the denominator ( [ eq : detj3 ] ) at temperature below 0.2 gev .",

    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : idealhydro ] that _ both _ shear and bulk effects lower the spectrum in the high @xmath3 region .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath4 by the bulk viscosity is due to the decrease in mean @xmath3 of the spectrum as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the non - triviality lies in the correction of the shear viscosity : it lowers the @xmath3-spectrum and still suppresses @xmath4 .",
    "this behavior was also observed for a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic flow @xcite .",
    "the viscous corrections in these calculations may have been overestimated for two reasons .",
    "firstly , we neglected @xmath159 by considering the ideal hydrodynamic flow .",
    "viscosity tends to make the system moderate and consequently thermodynamic forces , in particular , derivatives of the flow are expected to become smaller in the case of viscous hydrodynamic flow .",
    "this would reduce the amount of corrections considered here .",
    "secondly , the bulk pressure and the shear stress tensor are estimated in the first order theory , which naively means that they correspond to asymptotic values at the time much longer than relaxation times in the second order theory .",
    "figure [ fig : quadratic ] shows comparison of @xmath3-spectra and @xmath4 between with and without the quadratic ansatz . neither the amount of the correction nor its @xmath3 dependence seems to be similar to each other .",
    "the quadratic ansatz greatly underestimates the effects of the bulk viscosity .",
    "therefore , the proper procedure to obtain the prefactors in @xmath56 should be made as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] to correctly calculate the distortion of particle spectra due to the bulk viscosity .        finally when _ both _ shear viscosity and bulk viscosity are considered , the slope of the particle spectra becomes steeper but that of @xmath4 becomes moderate compared with that of the ideal distribution .",
    "the reason for the latter would be that the effect of the bulk viscosity and that of the shear viscosity accidentally cancels each other in the low @xmath3 region .",
    "we estimated the viscous corrections on the phase space distribution of a relativistic gas in a multi - component system .",
    "we found that generalization to a multi - component gas involves some subtleties .",
    "firstly , the trace part of the tensor term and the scalar term in the distortion of the distribution function are equivalent for a single component gas , but not for a multi - component one .",
    "numerical calculations suggest that one should have the trace part in the case of the 16-component hadron resonance gas . secondly",
    ", if one take zero net baryon density limit , one also has to take the limit for the landau matching condition for the baryon number current because it does yield a finite relation .",
    "since the number of equations does not change , we can uniquely determine the prefactors for the bulk pressure appearing in the distortion of the distribution .",
    "it is not desirable to introduce an additional ansatz that violates the matching conditions , since such an ansatz makes the system thermodynamically unstable in the first order theory .",
    "thirdly , the deviation of the distribution for the @xmath30-th gas component @xmath97 is generally different depending on whether it is the only component or one of the components .",
    "this comes from the fact that the prefactors in @xmath49 and @xmath46 , like thermodynamic variables , include information of all the components in the gas .    for hydrodynamic models of the qgp created in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the cooper - frye formula is necessary to convert macroscopic variables into microscopic distribution at freezeout .",
    "this enables us to compare the hydrodynamic results with experimental data , or to see further development of the hadronic matter in a cascade model .",
    "non - equilibrium effects are taken into account in the formula via the variation of the flow and the modification of the distribution .",
    "we focused only on the latter and estimated the viscous corrections on the @xmath3-spectra and the elliptic flow @xmath4 following the aforementioned discussion .",
    "profiles of the flow and the freezeout hypersurface are taken from the bjorken model with cylindrical geometry , the blast wave model with azimuthally anisotropic flow , and a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic model for the numerical calculations .",
    "we found that corrections of the bulk viscosity due to the distortion of the distribution have a visible effect on particle spectra and elliptic flow coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "this implies the importance of the bulk viscosity in constraining the transport coefficients with better accuracy from experimental data",
    ".    quantitatively speaking , the viscous effects might have been overestimated because we approximated the shear stress tensor and the bulk pressure as the ones in the first order theory and unlike in the second order theory , no relaxation effects are considered . as for the case of the estimation with an ideal hydrodynamic flow , the viscous corrections might be further exaggerated because the derivatives of the ideal hydrodynamic flow are generally larger than those of real viscous hydrodynamic flow .",
    "considering the fact that the shear viscosity also has non - trivial effects on particle spectra depending on the flow profile , a full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic flow is necessary to see more realistic behavior of @xmath3-spectra and @xmath160 .",

    "<S> we investigate particle spectra and elliptic flow coefficients in relativistic heavy ion collisions by taking into account the distortion of phase space distributions due to bulk viscosity at freezeout . </S>",
    "<S> we first calculate the distortion of phase space distributions in a multi - component system within the grad s fourteen moment method . </S>",
    "<S> we find some subtle issues when one matches macroscopic variables with microscopic momentum distributions in a multi - component system and develop a consistent procedure to uniquely determine the corrections in the phase space distributions . </S>",
    "<S> next , we calculate particle spectra by using the cooper - frye formula to see the effect of the bulk viscosity . in spite of the relative smallness of the bulk viscosity , we find that it is likely to have a visible effect in particle spectra and elliptic flow coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the importance of bulk viscosity together with shear viscosity if one wants to constrain the transport coefficients with better accuracy from experimental data . </S>"
