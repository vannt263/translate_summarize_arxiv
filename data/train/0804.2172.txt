    "belle collaboration has measured reactions producing @xmath2 mesons together with a @xmath5 from @xmath6 collisions @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass distributions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in these reactions peak around 70 mev above threshold .",
    "this observation lead to the claim of new resonances . in a previous paper @xcite belle",
    "has studied the @xmath1 invariant mass distribution in @xmath7 decays ( @xmath8 ) , in this case a peak was observed only a few mev above threshold and it was first suggested that this peak could be indicative of the existence of a new @xmath9 resonance .    this second experiment has been analyzed in several theoretical works . in @xcite it is concluded that the peak seen in @xcite may be caused by the @xmath3 if it is a virtual state .",
    "a latter work @xcite shows that this conclusion may be changed if one takes into account explicitly the @xmath10 width .",
    "a different approach is suggested in @xcite , where the @xmath3 is generated dynamically by the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons with vector ones .",
    "the idea of generating dynamically resonances in order to describe the newly found charmed states is not new and had already been exploited in @xcite .",
    "we have extended the ideas of these works including the hidden charm sector in @xcite .",
    "this work presents the results of @xcite in which the peaks seen in @xcite are interpreted as caused by some of the hidden charm subthreshold resonances dynamically generated in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the @xmath2 mesons in the reaction @xmath11 come from a resonance . in this case",
    "the reaction can be described by the diagram in figure [ fig1 ] and close to the @xmath0 threshold the amplitude depends strongly only on the @xmath0 invariant mass .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] ( -210,40)@xmath12    this amplitude can be written in terms of the @xmath13 propagator with all other parts factorized as a constant @xmath14 :    @xmath15    if we describe the @xmath13 resonance as a breit - wigner type .    the cross section can be calculated from the amplitude by integrating over the phase space of the three particles in the final state .",
    "since @xmath16 depends only on the @xmath0 invariant mass , one can evaluate the differential cross section that takes the form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the center of mass energy of the electron positron pair squared and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given by the relative momentum of the @xmath2 mesons and the relative momentum of the @xmath5 and the @xmath2 meson system in the rest frame of each system respectively .",
    "now we are going to describe the model for generating dynamically the resonances .",
    "first a field is written for all mesons belonging to a 15-plet of @xmath21 , one field , @xmath22 , for the pseudoscalars and another , @xmath23 for the vector mesons .",
    "explicit expressions for these fields can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangians are built by coupling two currents of the meson fields .",
    "the lagrangians built this way are @xmath21 invariant , but since this is not an exact symmetry in nature , one breaks it by suppressing the terms of these lagrangians where the underlying interaction is driven by the exchange of a heavy vector mesons @xcite .",
    "one collects the tree level amplitudes for meson - meson scattering , projected in s - wave , for each couple channel space , into a matrix .",
    "this matrix is used as input to solve the bathe - salpeter equation that in the on - shell formalism of @xcite , assumes an algebraic form :    @xmath24    the loop function , @xmath25 , has its imaginary part fixed in order to ensure unitarity of the t - matrix .",
    "resonances are identified as poles in the second riemann sheet of the t - matrix .    within this model the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath3",
    "are well reproduced .",
    "moreover interesting predictions are a heavy hidden charm scalar with mass around the @xmath0 threshold and an axial state with negative c - parity , almost degenerated in mass with the @xmath3 . also broad open",
    "charm states with exotic quantum numbers appear .",
    "these results are , though , less stable and contrast with previous works done where states with the same quantum numbers are narrower @xcite .",
    "the way we are going to apply this model to describe the reaction of figure [ fig1 ] is to substitute the breit - wigner amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) by the @xmath0 t - matrix calculated from eq .",
    "( [ bseq1 ] ) . for the reaction @xmath28 everything",
    "is done analogously using eq .",
    "( [ bseq2 ] ) for the t - matrix .",
    "the @xmath6 process measured by belle @xcite has a center of mass energy of @xmath29 gev .",
    "the @xmath30 is measured from threshold up to 5.0 gev . since our model is reliable for energies within a few hundreds of mev around the thresholds , we compare our model with belle s data for the points below 4.2 gev .",
    "the invariant mass distributions are measured in counts per bin . to simulate the bins we integrate our theoretical curves in bins of the same size as experiment and",
    "normalize so that the total integral of our curve matches the total number of events in the experiment .",
    "finally we compare the data with our predictions by a standard @xmath31 test .",
    "the model has one free parameter , which is the subtraction constant in the loop function , @xmath32 .",
    "we show results for different values of @xmath32 which correspond to a natural size .",
    "for the case of two @xmath2 mesons in a loop , for example , the value @xmath32=-1.3 correspond to a cut off with @xmath33 850 mev .",
    "we present results for different values of @xmath32 together with the corresponding pole position .    in table [ tab1 ]",
    "we show results , in the scalar sector , for the value of @xmath31 calculated with the data from belle , for all points below 4.2 gev in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 production . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows plots of our theoretical histograms compared with the experimental data @xcite .",
    ".results of @xmath36 and @xmath31 for different values of @xmath32 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have analyzed a recent experiment from belle @xcite where peaks are observed in the @xmath2 meson pair invariant mass suggesting new states with hidden charm .",
    "we have calculated the differential cross sections for these measurements from the point of view that the @xmath2 meson pairs are produced by dynamically generated resonances below threshold .",
    "our theoretical model describes very well the data for the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution as being caused by a dynamically generated scalar resonance below @xmath0 threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath31 values obtained in the fit of our theoretical curves for the @xmath1 invariant mass distribution are too big , favoring thus the interpretation of a new state with mass around 3940 mev .",
    "although we have a good description of the scalar resonance , the large experimental uncertainties do not discard other possibilities .",
    "new experiments to search for this predicted scalar state are most welcome ."
