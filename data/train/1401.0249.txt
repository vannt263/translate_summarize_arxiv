    "the world we live in is not restricted to euclidean geometry like lines , squares , rectangles , circles , semi - circles , spheres , etc only . instead , there are curves twisted so wildly that they occupy plane not a line , there are surfaces folded so badly that they occupy space not a plane , there are objects so stringy or ramified that their constituents are distributed scarcely not uniformly .",
    "indeed , most of the natural objects we see around us are so complex in shape and structure that euclidean geometry is not sufficient to describe them . many of these objects used to be described as geometrically chaotic , since they are not just merely complex but often contain different degrees of complexity . in 1975 mandelbrot introduced the idea of fractal to describe these geometrically chaotic objects and it has revolutionized the notion of geometry forever .",
    "it helps us appreciate the fact that there exists some kind of order even in seemingly disordered and apparently bewildering objects @xcite .",
    "prior to the inception of the idea of fractal , geometry remained one of the main branches of mathematics .",
    "however , soon after its inception , it has attracted mathematicians , physicists , and engineers all alike and hence generated a widespread interest in subjects like physics , chemistry , biology , earth science , economics , etc @xcite . the exact definition of fractal remains elusive even after more than thirty five years .",
    "this is partly because mandelbrot himself was somewhat reluctant to confine it within the boundaries of a mere definition .",
    "he nevertheless proposed that fractal is a geometric object with irregular shape made of parts similar to the whole , in some sense .",
    "the idea of the hausdorff - besicovitch dimension , however , plays a pivotal role in defining fractal .",
    "consider that the measure @xmath1 describes the size of the set of points that constitute an euclidean object .",
    "we can quantify the size of the measure @xmath1 by using a @xmath2-dimensional hyper - cube of linear size @xmath3 as an yardstick .",
    "we can write the measure @xmath1 in terms of the number @xmath4 needed to cover the object as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the test function @xcite .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath4 for euclidean objects always satisfies @xmath7 and hence @xmath4 is a homogeneous function .",
    "one can explicitly prove that only a power - law solution for @xmath4 can satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdim5 ] ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is easy to check that @xmath8 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdim5 ] ) .",
    "it implies the dimension @xmath9 of an object can be defined as the slope of the plot of @xmath4 vs @xmath3 in the @xmath10 scale .",
    "obviously , the slope @xmath9 of such a plot for euclidean objects will always be an integer quantity .",
    "however , there exists another class of natural or man - made objects for which the slope of the same plot may assume a non - integer value which we typically denote by @xmath11 .",
    "we can therefore generalize the solution for @xmath4 upon replacing @xmath9 by an unconstrained exponent @xmath12 . using it in eq .",
    "( [ eq : measure ] ) we find that there exists a critical dimension @xmath13 , known as the hausdorff - besicovitch ( h - b ) dimension , for which the measure @xmath14 neither vanishes nor diverges as @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus , an object is fractal if the h - b dimension @xmath16 assumes a non - integer value and at the same time it is less than the dimension of the space where the object is being embedded .",
    "one of the best known text - book example of fractal is the triadic cantor set .",
    "it starts with an initiator , typically an interval of unit size , and a generator that divides it into three equal parts and remove the middle third .",
    "the generator is then applied at each successive step to all the available smaller intervals over and over again .",
    "the resulting set has a non - integer h - b dimension @xmath17 with numerical value less than that of the space @xmath18 where the set is embedded @xcite .",
    "besides its pedagogical importance , the cantor set problem has also been of theoretical and practical interest @xcite .",
    "however , as far as natural fractals are concerned , the cantor set lacks at least in two ways .",
    "firstly , it does not appear through evolution in time , although fractals in nature do so .",
    "secondly , it is not governed by any sort of randomness throughout its construction process , while natural fractals always occur through some kind of evolution accompanied by some randomness .",
    "note that nature likes freedom not determinism .",
    "indeed , it is well understood that in our world almost nothing is stationary or strictly deterministic .",
    "most natural objects we see around us are seemingly complex in character albeit they are governed by simple rules .",
    "note that it is the simple rules when repeated over and over again that make the resulting system look mighty complex in the end .",
    "motivated by the importance and impact of the cantor set , we investigate here a couple of its interesting variants in which probability , time and randomness are incorporated in a logical progression . to this end",
    ", we first propose dyadic cantor set ( dcs ) which is simpler than the much known triadic cantor set ( tcs ) since dividing into two is undeniably simpler than dividing into three in any sense .",
    "we then introduce the kinetic counterpart of the dcs by applying the generator to only one interval at each step by picking it preferentially with respect to interval size .",
    "the sequential application of the generator immediately introduces time as one parameter in the problem and hence it helps us to understand its impact on the resulting fractal and various other observable quantities .",
    "finally , we introduce spatial randomness by modifying the generator such that it divides an interval randomly into two parts instead of dividing into two equal parts and apply it sequentially like kinetic dcs .",
    "consequently , it now incorporates both time and spatial randomness in the system making it a stochastic counterpart of the dcs .",
    "each variants of the dcs are solved analytically to obtain the fractal dimension and to show self - similarity .",
    "analytic results , especially the self - similar properties , are verified numerically by invoking the idea of data collapse .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we propose the dyadic cantor set and discuss various properties . in section iii , we propose the kinetic counterpart of the dyadic cantor set and solve it exactly to obtain the fractal dimension and various other properties . in section iv",
    ", we investigate the stochastic counterpart of the dyadic cantor set and solve it analytically .",
    "we also propose its exact algorithm to solve it by numerical simulation to verify our analytical results .",
    "we then revisit the kinetic dcs problem in section v with an aim to check whether it also exhibits dynamic scaling or not .",
    "finally , in section vi , we give a general discussion and summary of the work .",
    "in this section , we first define the dyadic cantor set ( dcs ) and then investigate its various aspects .",
    "it starts with an initiator which is typically an interval of unit length @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the generator then divides the initiator into two equal parts and deletes one , say the right half , with probability @xmath0 .",
    "after step one , the system on average will have @xmath20 number of sub - intervals of size @xmath21 , since the right half interval remains there in step one with probability @xmath22 . in the next step ,",
    "the generator is applied to each of the @xmath20 available sub - intervals to divide them into two equal parts and remove the right half from each of the @xmath23 intervals with probability @xmath0 .",
    "the system will then have on average @xmath24 number of intervals of size @xmath25 as @xmath26 number of intervals of size @xmath25 are removed on average .",
    "the process is then continued over and over again by applying the generator on all the available intervals at each successive step recursively .    finding the fractal dimension of the dcs problem is as simple as its definition .",
    "according to the construction of the dcs process , there are @xmath27 intervals in the @xmath28th generation and they are of size @xmath29 . the most convenient yard - stick to measure the size of the set in the @xmath28th step is the mean interval size @xmath29 . expressing @xmath30 in favour of @xmath3 by using @xmath29 , we find @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "note that the exponent @xmath11 is non - integer for all @xmath33 and at the same time it is less than the dimension of the space @xmath18 , where the set is embedded .",
    "it is therefore the fractal dimension of the resulting dcs which does not fill up the unit interval continuously to constitute a line . unlike the triadic cantor set where the cantor dusts are distributed in a strictly self - similar fashion",
    ", the cantor dusts in the dyadic cantor set are distributed in a random fashion , yet it is self - similar in the statistical sense only .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the triadic cantor set is worth mentioning here .",
    "the intervals which are removed from the triadic cantor set are of size @xmath34 etc and if we add them up we get @xmath35 this is the size of the initiator and hence it means that there is nothing left in the triadic cantor set , since the sum of the sizes that are removed equals the size of the initiator .",
    "interestingly , we find that a similar argument holds for dyadic cantor set too .",
    "for instance , on the average in step one the amount of size removed is @xmath36 , in step two the total amount of size removed is @xmath37 , in step three it is @xmath38 , in step four it is @xmath39 and so on .",
    "if we add these intervals we have @xmath40 which is again the size of the initiator .",
    "it means , like in the triadic cantor set , there is hardly anything left in the dcs .",
    "however , we will show later that there are still tons of members in the set .",
    "we now ask : what happens if the generator of the dcs is applied to only one interval at each step instead of applying it to all the available intervals in each successive step ?",
    "clearly , the spatial distribution of the remaining intervals will be very different from the one created by the dcs problem .",
    "yet the question is : will the number @xmath30 needed to cover the set by an yardstick , say the mean interval size @xmath3 , still exhibit a power - law against @xmath3 ?",
    "if yes , will the exponent _ vis - a - vis _ the fractal dimension be the same as that of the dcs ? to find a definite answer to these questions , it is important to appreciate the fact that after step one and beyond the system will have intervals of different sizes and hence it raises a further question : how do we choose one interval when the system has intervals of different sizes ? to this end , we choose the most generic case whereby an interval is picked preferentially with respect to their sizes .    the algorithm of the kinetic dcs problem can be defined as follows .",
    "like dcs it also starts with an initiator of a unit interval @xmath19 $ ] . in the first step the generator divides",
    "the initiator into two sub - intervals of equal size and removes one of the part , say the right half , with probability @xmath0 .",
    "there are now @xmath20 intervals each of size @xmath21 . in the next step",
    "we generate a random number @xmath41 from the open interval @xmath42 and find which of the @xmath20 sub - intervals contains this number @xmath41 in order to ensure that the interval is picked preferentially according to their sizes . if @xmath41 is found within the interval @xmath43 $ ] then we pick it ; else we pick the right interval if it has not already been removed .",
    "say , the left interval contains @xmath41 and hence we pick that and the generator is then applied onto it only . in any case ,",
    "time is increased by one unit even if @xmath41 is found within the interval that has been removed in which case the generator is not applied at all .    in order to study the kinetic dcs problem",
    "analytically , we use the binary fragmentation equation @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of intervals within the size range @xmath46 and @xmath47 at time @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the fragmentation kernel that specifies the rate and the rules of the fragmentation process . the first term on the right hand side of the above equation",
    "describes the loss of interval of size @xmath46 due to its breakup into two smaller intervals , while the second term describes the gain of interval of size @xmath46 due to breakup of an interval of size @xmath50 into two smaller pieces ensuring that one of the two smaller intervals is of size @xmath46 .",
    "the factor @xmath51 in the gain term implies that at each time step two intervals are produced out of one interval .",
    "however , in the context of the present model we need to replace the factor @xmath51 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : binary_frag ] ) by @xmath20 to ensure that on the average at each breaking event @xmath20 number of new intervals are produced .",
    "next , we need to choose the following kernel @xmath52 to ensure that at each breaking event an interval is picked preferentially with respect to interval size and divide it into two equal pieces . using the two facts in eq .",
    "( [ eq : binary_frag ] ) we obtain @xmath53 which is the required fitting equation that describes the kinetic dcs problem .",
    "we now find it convenient to incorporate the definition of the moment @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kdcs ] ) which gives the rate equation for @xmath55 that reads as @xmath56m_{n+1}(t).\\ ] ] this equation reveals that there exists a value of @xmath57 for which the moment @xmath58 is a conserved quantity .",
    "the value of @xmath59 can be found simply by finding the root of the following equation @xmath60 solving it we obtain @xmath61 implying that the moment @xmath62 is a conserved quantity . to verify it",
    "numerically we denote the sizes of all the surviving intervals at the @xmath63th step as @xmath64 starting from the left most till the right most within @xmath19 $ ] in order to avoid the use of @xmath65 in the definition of the moment .",
    "the @xmath59th moment then is @xmath66 which is indeed a conserved quantity according to fig .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the numerical value of the conserved quantity @xmath62 is not the same at every independent realization .",
    "the question remains : why the index of the moment @xmath61 is so special ? to find an answer to this question we invoke the idea of fractal analysis below .",
    "it is expected that the kinetic dcs problem too , like the simple dcs , will generate fractal in the long time limit and hence it must possess self - similarity as it is an essential property of fractal .",
    "that is , the various moments of @xmath65 , which correspond to observable quantities , should exhibit a power - law relation with time , since dimensional functions are always power - law monomial in character .",
    "we therefore can write a tentative solution for the @xmath28th moment as @xmath67 if we insist that it must obey the conservation law , @xmath68 then the exponent @xmath69 must satisfy @xmath70 .",

    "( [ eq : number ] ) . in fractal analysis",
    ", one usually seeks for a power - law relation between the number @xmath4 and a suitable yard - stick size @xmath3 .",
    "the mean interval size @xmath3 is definitely the best choice for the yard - stick . to find the required relation we therefore eliminate @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : number ] ) in favour of @xmath3 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_krdcs ] ) and we immediately find that @xmath30 exhibits the same power - law @xmath84 as we found in the case of dcs including the exponent @xmath85 .",
    "it implies that the value of the index @xmath59 of the conserved quantity is actually the fractal dimension .",
    "one could not help but check about the @xmath11th moment in the dcs case too .",
    "in this case the @xmath11th moment in the @xmath28th step is @xmath86 and hence it is indeed a conserved quantity since all the intervals are of same size regardless of the @xmath28 value .",
    "the same is also true for the triadic cantor set and one can easily verify it by setting @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is surprising in the sense that on one hand the sum of all the intervals which are removed is equal to the size of the initiator revealing there is nothing left in the set . on the other hand , the @xmath11th moment @xmath79 in all cases",

    "the connections between the fractal dimension and the conserved quantity was first reported by ben - naim and krapivsky in the context of the stochastic cantor set @xcite .",

    "it is true that fractal in the dcs has some form of spatial randomness albeit the intervals at any stage of the construction process are of equal size . in contrast ,",
    "intervals in the kinetic dcs are distributed not only randomly but they are also of different size at any given stage .",
    "yet , we find that they share the same fractal dimension owing to the same deterministic rule in the definition of the generator .",
    "nature do not like determinism rather it likes to enjoy some form of freedom in the selection process .",
    "freedom in the present context means the liberty to divide an interval randomly .",
    "we therefore ask : what if we use a generator that divides an interval randomly into two smaller intervals instead of dividing it into two equal intervals ? to this end we propose the following stochastic dyadic cantor .",

    "note that the solution for @xmath55 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment_sdcs ] ) clearly suggests that the dynamics of the stochastic dcs too governed by a conservation law namely the moment of order @xmath96 is a conserved quantity .",

    "we find that the number @xmath4 needed to cover the resulting set scales as @xmath98 with @xmath99 revealing that the index of the conserved quantity is again equal to the fractal dimension ( see fig .",
    "note that the fractal dimension @xmath99 is always less than @xmath100 regardless of the value of @xmath22 .",

    "it seems quite like a rule than otherwise as we have found it to true also in the case of its opposition phenomena namely in aggregation @xcite .",
    "we shall now apply the buckingham @xmath101-theorem to obtain a scaling solution for @xmath65 as it provides a deeper insight into the problem @xcite . note that according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdcs ] ) the governed parameter @xmath102 depends on three parameters @xmath46 , @xmath48 and @xmath22 of which only the former two are dimensional .",
    "however , the knowledge about the decay law for the mean interval size implies that one of the parameter , say @xmath46 , can be expressed in terms of @xmath48 since we find @xmath103 must bear the dimension of the interval size @xmath46 .",

    "( 5 ) ) .",
    "one of the key features of fractal is that it must be self - similar .",
    "in general , by self - similarity we mean that a suitably chosen part of an object represents the whole . the question is : what do we mean by self - similarity in stochastic fractal ?",
    "note that stochastic fractal such as stochastic dcs is not static rather it evolves with time . by self - similarity in such a case , we mean that it is similar with itself at different times .",
    "note that the same system at different times are similar if the numerical values of various dimensional governing parameters are different , however , the numerical values of the corresponding dimensionless quantities must coincide .",
    "indeed , in the case of stochastic dcs the numerical value of the governed parameter @xmath65 for a given value of the governing parameter @xmath46 is different at different time which can easily be seen in fig ( 5 ) .",
    "however , the numerical value of the corresponding dimensionless governed parameter @xmath124 and the dimensionless governing parameter @xmath125 should coincide .",
    "that is , all the distinct sets of curve of @xmath65 as a function of @xmath46 at different times should collapse onto one single curve if we plot @xmath124 as a function of @xmath125 .",

    "( 5 ) and found that the data points of all the three distinct curves of fig ( 5 ) merge superbly onto a single universal curve which is essentially the scaling function @xmath126 .",
    "what about self - similarity in the kinetic dyadic cantor set ? does it also exhibit dynamic scaling ?",
    "a closer look at the solution @xmath127 for the stochastic dcs perhaps can guide us to write the solution of @xmath65 for the kinetic dcs . to this end",

( 6 ) ) and then plot the corresponding dimensionless quantities @xmath131 vs @xmath125 .",
    "we once again find a superb data - collapse which is shown in the inset of the fig ( 6 ) revealing that the fractal generated by kinetic dcs too exhibits a dynamic scaling _ vis - a - vis _ self - similarity .",
    "in this section we attempt to summarize and put all our findings into perspective . in this article we proposed a dyadic cantor set and then its kinetic and stochastic counterpart . in these models we incorporated probability , time and randomness in such a way that a logical flow can easily be appreciated .",
    "firstly , we solved the dcs problem by using probabilistic argument and found that it emerges as a fractal of dimension @xmath80 .",
    "then we solved the kinetic and stochasticc dcs using the rate equation approach and found that the resulting systems emerge as fractal of dimensions @xmath80 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "our studies reveal that the inclusion of kinetics alone does not alter the value of the fractal dimension .",
    "however , inclusion of randomness in the generator of the stochastic dcs does change the value of the fractal dimension and found that it is always smaller than that of the dcs or the kinetic dcs .",
    "besides giving exact analytical expressions for fractal dimensions we have also given solutions for the interval size distribution function @xmath65 for both kinetic and stochastic dcs problem alongside numerical simulations which fully support our solutions .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the distribution function @xmath65 evolves to a state where it exhibits dynamic scaling @xmath127 .",
    "we used the idea of data - collapse to verify it numerically .",
    "for instance , we have drawn @xmath65 vs @xmath46 using data for a fixed time and found a distinct set of curves for every different time of the process . however , these distinct curves collapsed onto a single universal curve when we expressed @xmath65 in unit of @xmath132 and @xmath46 in unit of @xmath133 .",
    "it implies that the system is similar to itself at different time and hence we say that such systems exhibit self - similarity .",
    "it readily implies that the solution is independent of initial condition .",
    "we have shown that the self - similar properties in all three cases are accompanied by conservation laws and interestingly the value of the fractal dimension @xmath11 coincide with the index of the conserved quantity @xmath79 . the numerical value of the conserved quantity @xmath79 , however , is found different at each realization . we have then checked if the @xmath11th moment is also a conserved in the dyadic and traditional triadic cantor set and found that it is obeyed in both the cases as well .",
    "we think it is quite safe to argue that when systems evolve and yet preserve self - similarity then the dynamics of the system must be governed by conservation law .    to explain why the quantity @xmath79 always remains constant we find it useful to consider a simple dimensional analysis . according to eq .",
