    "one of standard ways of quantum magnets modeling is to consider a finite set of @xmath2 nodes carrying spins @xmath3 , @xmath4 , with a spin number @xmath5 . at present such models",
    "are also used to investigate properties of magnetic macromolecules as mn@xmath6acetate @xcite . the so - called _ ising states _ or _ configurations _ , _",
    "i.e. _  tensor products @xmath7 of one - spin states @xmath8 form a natural basis @xmath9 of the quantum space of states @xmath10 with the dimension @xmath11 . in a general case",
    ", however , these states are _ not _ eigenvectors of the heisenberg - like hamiltonians .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to solve an eigenproblem with @xmath12 equations what , even using contemporary computers , is almost impossible for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is especially important when one wants to investigate spin correlations in the ground state and some of the first excited states of antiferromagnetic systems , since many methods allow to determine eigenvalues , but it is much more difficult to find eigenvectors . among others ,",
    "it is caused by the numerical instability of necessary algorithms in the case of a very large number of linear equations @xcite .",
    "the problem is partially solved by taking into account operators commuting with a given hamiltonian : _",
    "e.g. _  the @xmath15-th component of the total spin @xmath16 and irreducible representations of the hamiltonian symmetry group @xcite . if the spin interactions are isotropic , then also the total spin number may be taken into account .",
    "however one has to find solutions of a set of homogeneous linear equations arising from the eigenproblem for @xmath17 ( in finite spin system eigenvalues of @xmath17 are known ) . in many interesting cases , for example investigating the ground state of bipartite antiferromagnets ,",
    "these solutions can be found _ exactly _ if one is able to cope with very large integers .",
    "such tools are provided by multiple ( or arbitrary ) precision libraries like the gnu multiple precision arithmetic library ( gmp or gnu mp in short ) written and developed by t.  granlund @xcite .",
    "however , such procedures work efficiently if the matrix of an operator ( the squared total spin @xmath17 or the hamiltonian @xmath18 in the presented considerations ) are written in the symmetry adapted basis .",
    "the considerations presented are illustrated by examples related with finite spin models , but a similar method can be applied in any case when :    * the space of states @xmath10 is spanned over orthonormal vectors ( [ state ] ) , _ i.e. _  it is the @xmath2th tensor power of the @xmath19-dimensional one - particle space ; * the considered operator @xmath18 , acting in @xmath10 , commutes with a given permutation representation @xmath20 of a group @xmath0 ( the hamiltonian symmetry group ) .",
    "let a given group @xmath0 permutes vectors of a ( finite ) basis @xmath9 of the quantum state space @xmath10 . in the previous paper @xcite general formulas for vectors of the irreducible basis and matrix elements of any operator commuting with all permutation operators",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , have been presented .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the dihedral groups @xmath1 and obtain general analytical expressions in this case .",
    "these groups have been chosen , since they describe symmetry of molecular rings with @xmath2 identical spins @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in fact , these rings are also invariant under the reflection @xmath23 in the horizontal plane , so the groups @xmath24 should be considered .",
    "these groups are important , for example , constructing symmetry coordinates of vibrating molecules or crystals , but in the case of spin models the action of @xmath23 is trivial . considering planar molecules one should introduce groups @xmath25 , which are elementary ` bricks ' for finite space groups @xcite .",
    "however , groups @xmath1 and @xmath25 are isomorphic and the abstract group @xmath1 is considered as a representative of isomorphic groups with the following generation relations @xcite : @xmath26    the dihedral group @xmath1 consists of @xmath27 elements : @xmath2 powers of the @xmath2-fold rotation @xmath28 and perpendicular to it the twofold rotations @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",

    "so the case of @xmath2 even seems to be more important , however the other case ( @xmath2 odd ) is discussed for three , at least , reasons : ( i ) the ground state energy of infinite linear antiferromagnets is approximated from below and above by those obtained in the cases of even- and odd - sized rings , respectively @xcite ; ( ii ) there are still some open problem related with linear ferromagnets ( _ e.g. _ critical exponents near @xmath34k @xcite ) ; in this case the parity of @xmath2 is ( almost ) irrelevant ; ( iii ) the presented considerations and results are more complete . in sec .",

    "only two of them are obtained from @xmath318 under the action of bilinear terms @xmath319 , namely @xmath320 and @xmath321 hence , the non - zero off - diagonal terms in the sixteenth columns are @xmath322 all other elements of operator matrices can be obtained using the following formulas : @xmath323 the matrices of the hamiltonian @xmath259 and the square of total spin @xmath232 are presented in table  [ hs2 ] .",
    "@xmath324    the irrep @xmath71 has not been chosen merely due to the simplest form of the coefficients @xmath325 , but in order to illustrate the other way of determination of matrix elements in this case .",
    "let an orbit @xmath326 consists of @xmath327 elements ( @xmath106 is a stabilizer of the configuration @xmath328\\,\\mu\\rangle$ ] ) .",
    "hence , the fully symmetric state @xmath329 is given as @xmath330 where @xmath331 are representatives of left cosets @xmath332 . since a stabilizer of each element in the orbit",
    "@xmath326 has @xmath333 elements than @xmath334 let @xmath335 denote the off - diagonal part of a hamiltonian @xmath259 , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath336 .",
    "the symmetry operators @xmath21 commute with a hamiltonian @xmath335 , so @xmath337 to simplify the further considerations we limit ourselves to the cases @xmath338 , when @xmath339 , since in the case of larger spin numbers more detailed discussion is necessary . under this assumption ,",
    "each of off - diagonal terms of the bilinear hamiltonian gives the empty sate @xmath340 or one configuration without any coefficients .",
    "let @xmath341 denote a number of configurations obtained from @xmath314 ( by the action of @xmath335 ) and belonging to the orbit @xmath342 .",
    "then @xmath343 contains @xmath344 configurations from the orbit @xmath342 .",
    "since the state @xmath345 are constructed from _ all _ @xmath346 elements of the orbit @xmath342 , then @xmath344 has to be divisible by @xmath346 and each element the orbit @xmath342 appears @xmath347 times in the considered sum @xmath348 vectors @xmath349 . as the result",
    "we obtain @xmath350 in the example presented above @xmath351 and the off - diagonal terms of the hamiltonian give us six configurations belonging to the orbit @xmath352 ( with @xmath353 ) .",
    "the additional terms in @xmath232 operator lead to three configurations in the 6-element orbit @xmath354 .",
    "therefore , @xmath355 what agrees with the previous results .",
    "the further considerations go beyond the scope of this paper , since there are some numerical rather than combinatorial problems .",
    "however , we are very close to the solution of the eigenproblem and it is interesting to calculate the ground state energy . in the case of isotropic hamiltonians , when @xmath236 is a good quantum number , we determine an orthonormal basis for each space @xmath356 solving the eigenproblem @xmath357 for @xmath358 ( @xmath359 may be omitted since there are no states with @xmath360 and @xmath230 ) .",
    "it can be done , for example , using such packages as _ mathematica_@xmath361 or numerical libraries for calculations with an arbitrary precision as gmp @xcite .",
    "then , we transform the hamiltonian to this new basis , what leads to a quasi - diagonal matrix consisting of blocks with dimensions 5 , 1 , 6 , 2 , 3 , 1 for @xmath358 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to solve the eigenproblems for such small blocks and , for example , in the case @xmath362 we obtain five eigenvalues : 8.6174 , 4.7979 , 3.3302 , 0.3391 , 3.0846 , where the first one corresponds to the ground state with energy per spin 1.43624 . in the case of such small eigenproblems",
    "one can also determine eigenstates can be solved exactly in many cases .",
    "this leads to an _ exact _ form of blocks in the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "however , the hamiltonian eigenproblem , except for some special cases , has to be solved numerically with the precision depending on software and hardware used .",
    "therefore , all numbers obtained give only approximate values of energies , correlations , vector coefficients _",
    "etc_. ] and , therefore , it is possible to calculate spin correlations in the ground state .",
    "in this paper we have studied properties of the dihedral groups @xmath1 to obtain analytical formulas for number of double cosets and their elements . these results are necessary to exploit in full symmetry properties of a given spin operator and to obtain its matrix elements in the symmetry adapted basis .",
    "the groups considered are important in investigation of magnetic macromolecules forming rings or other structures with isomorphic symmetry group ( _ e.g. _  crown - like structures ) . in a sense this paper , together with the preceding one @xcite , continues works done for the cyclic groups by t.  lulek and one of the authors ( wf ) @xcite . in those articles the arithmetic structure of a number of nodes @xmath2 was mostly taken into account and some combinatorial object were considered .",
    "the present series of papers is mainly devoted to combinatorial and group - theoretical objects and the most important result is the formula for matrix elements expressed as the sum over representatives of double cosets . in the case of dihedral groups",
    "the approach proposed has two advantages : ( i ) all formulas can be obtained in analytical form and they can be used in computer programmes ; ( ii ) in one dimension a loop over double coset representatives is , in general , shorter than a loop over all off - diagonal elements of bilinear heisenberg hamiltonian , what has been discussed in the previous paper @xcite ; moreover , it is easy to modify hamiltonian introducing , for example , interactions with the next nearest neighbors or alternating exchange integrals .",
    "it should be underlined , however , that the final diagonalization of a given hamiltonian is ( almost ) always done numerically , with all round - off errors caused by the float - point representation of numbers .",
    "secondly , the method proposed only slightly increase the size of system which can be investigated .",
    "the so - called ` combinatorial explosion ' leads to very large eigenproblems for quite small systems : _",
    "e.g. _  a system consisting of twelve spins @xmath363 yields more than 240 millions ising configurations , so there are about ten millions orbits of the dihedral group @xmath364 ; more than 800 thousands orbits correspond to @xmath228 , so this is the approximate of @xmath232 eigenproblem dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "not so much smaller system with @xmath365 leads to about 2,500 orbits with @xmath228 , what can be investigated using modern computers . a number in the same range",
    "is obtained for @xmath366 and @xmath367 , but we hope to determine the ground state energy for the heisenberg antiferromagnetic ring with @xmath368 nodes , where a system of about 50 thousands linear equations has to be solved .",
    "however , if one would like to determine the thermodynamic properties then _ all _ states have to be taken account , among others these with the symmetry @xmath369 , which are double - fold degenerated , so the dimension of @xmath232 eigenproblem is approximately two times larger than that for one - dimensional irreps .",
