    "@xcite for recent reviews and further references ) .",
    "it was studied at length , inspired in particular by some biological molecular motors ( e.g. one - headed kinesins c351 ) @xcite . at the same time , the fascinating topic of anomalous diffusion @xcite and , in particular , subdiffusion , where the position variance grows sublinearly in time , i.e. @xmath9 with @xmath1 , gained dramatically in the importance and interest .",
    "this interest is promoted not in the last line by the emerging evidence for subdiffusion in such complex media as actin filament networks , other protein solutions , interiors of biological cells @xcite , as well as in the conformational dynamics of protein macromolecules @xcite . at the moment ,",
    "subdiffusion is experimentally firmly established in different media with different @xmath4 s in the range of @xmath10 .",
    "it is thus natural that these two paradigms - breaking(-and - forming ) research lines are currently crossing .",
    "whether thermal ratchets based on anomalous subdiffusion are possible or not presents a highly nontrivial challenge , even on the level of basic and somewhat oversimplified models . in particular , a periodically forced continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) subdiffusion and the associated fractional fokker - planck dynamics @xcite turned out to be not sensitive to the action of time - periodic fields in the long time limit with an exception of enhancement of unbiased subdiffusion @xcite .",
    "this fact seems to rule out the very possibility of rocking ( i.e. fluctuating tilt @xcite ) subdiffusive ratchets based on the ctrw mechanism @xcite , and possibly also on the quenched disorder @xcite , leaving , however , a door for the flashing ( i.e. pulsating potential @xcite ) subdiffusive ratchets based on these mechanisms open @xcite .    in biological applications , the subdiffusion scenario based on the alternative to ctrw , fractional",
    "brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite and associated generalized langevin equation ( gle ) descriptions @xcite can , however , be more relevant @xcite , in particular , because of such a subdiffusion is ergodic @xcite .",
    "it does not require a quasi - infinite mean residence time in any tiny spatial domain , or trap @xcite , and in contrast with the ctrw subdiffusion @xcite does not suffer from such non - ergodic features as spontaneous immobilization of some particles for the time of observation @xcite .",
    "given a small number of functionally specific ( sub)diffusing macromolecules , a sudden  non - ergodic  standstill could have fatal consequences for the cell functioning .",
    "however , what is the physical origin of gle subdiffusion ?",
    "in complex environments , such as interior of biological cells densely stuffed with different macromolecules , including actin filaments , either mobile , or building up the cytoskeleton networks , static , as in eucaryots , or dynamically flickering , as in bacteria , it can be due to long range negative correlations in the diffusing particle displacements ( and velocity alternations ) caused by crowding .",
    "a particle moving with an instant velocity @xmath11 in certain direction invokes besides a viscous drag also a quasi - elastic response of environment opposing the motion .",
    "the total dissipative force can be written in linear approximation as @xmath12 with a memory friction kernel @xmath13 .",
    "for an oscillatory motion , @xmath14 , with frequency @xmath15 , the friction force becomes frequency - dependent , with amplitude @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the frequency - dependent friction  , @xmath18 , which was introduced in the theory of viscoelasticity by a. gemant @xcite along with the formalism of fractional derivatives . ] .",
    "the subdiffusive behavior can emerge for some special forms of @xmath13 ( see below ) when this friction diverges at zero - frequency , i.e. @xmath19 , or also on some sufficiently long transient time scale , when @xmath20 is large but finite , which is a more realistic assumption .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) dictates that at thermal equilibrium the corresponding energy loss due to dissipation must always be compensated on average by an energy gain due to unbiased ( on average ) random force of environment @xmath21 . for a particle of mass @xmath22 initially localized ( @xmath23 for @xmath24 )",
    "this leads to gle description @xcite , @xmath25 where the memory kernel and the autocorrelation function of noise are related by the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) @xcite @xmath26 at temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the thermal random force @xmath21 has necessarily gaussian statistics within the _ linear _ friction approximation considered here @xcite , i.e. within _ linear _ fdt , but _ not _ necessarily otherwise @xcite .    in the following , @xmath28 ,",

    "it is modulated in time by an external force @xmath31 . in the numerical simulations below it",

    "apart from above phenomenological justification , the gle description can be derived from the hamiltonian dynamics @xcite , i.e. from the first principles .",
    "all this makes the gle approach to anomalous diffusion and relaxation processes ever more attractive . for spatially and temporally unbiased ( on average )",
    "force fields @xmath35 , a rectification current ( i.e. ratchet effect ) can emerge if only the symmetry of detailed balance is destroyed by an external driving @xcite which provides also an energy supply to drive the rectified dissipative motion in certain direction .    a popular model of viscoelasticity with @xmath36 where @xmath1 ( the factor @xmath37 is to relate our description with others making use of the definition of fractional caputo derivative of the fractional order @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "moreover , such a gle subdiffusion with @xmath68 has been used to mimic @xcite a potential - free single - file subdiffusion of hard core brownian particles due to a geometric crowding effect ( i.e. , a particle can not move farther than some typical distance until another , road - blocking particle moves ) @xcite",
    ". the latter one has been experimentally realized and observed with colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "even if the presence of a biasing force acting on _ all _ particles clearly destroys this correspondence ( since all the particles drift normally in the same direction ) , one can imagine a situation where an external field acts only on _ some _ , e.g. , electrically charged guest particles",
    ". then one can expect that this correspondence might hold further and the behavior of the charged tracer particles ( e.g. a globular proteins in a suspension of neutral colloidal particles confined in a quasi - one - dimensional geometry ) in some electrical potential @xmath69 externally imposed can yet be mimicked by gle in agreement with @xcite .",
    "similar colloidal systems @xcite can be considered as plausible candidates for an experimental realization of subdiffusive ratchets with @xmath68 which we consider in the following for the purpose of illustration .",
    "the qualitatively same effects were also found for @xmath67 and are expected for other values of @xmath4 as well .",
    "the emergence of subdiffusive ratchet effect is highly nontrivial .",
    "it has been recently shown numerically for sinusoidal potential @xcite that such a viscoelastic subdiffusion is asymptotically not sensitive to the amplitude of the periodic potential , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this fact might seem to rule out the very possibility of such a rocking ratchet as well . on the contrary ,",
    "we show in this work that such subdiffusive brownian ratchets are possible and moreover they display a resonance - like dependence on the driving frequency @xmath34 .",
    "the rectification current _ vanishes _ in the limit of adiabatic rocking , in a clear contrast with the normal diffusion rocking ratchets , where it is maximal @xcite .",
    "this behavior somewhat resembles pulsing potential ratchets of normal diffusion .",
    "the physical mechanisms are , however , different .",
    "in particular , our ratchet also exhibits the phenomenon of ( sub)current inversion at sufficiently fast driving , similar to its normal diffusion counterpart @xcite , whereas the subdiffusion coefficient remains rather robust and weakly sensitive to the details of potential and driving , being close to that of free subdiffusion . with a further increase of driving frequency the rectification current gradually vanishes",

    "take a note that the tilt in the opposite direction does not result in a barrierless total potential .",
    "this intuitively selects ( think about an overdamped particle sliding in the tilted potential ) the right direction for the net current in the case of a slow time - periodic forcing , symmetric and unbiased on average . for a smaller rocking force amplitude ,",

    "the cases of linear and parabolic @xmath72 present the only known exceptions @xcite which can not much help in the context of ratchet problem .",
    "this , in particular , makes a rigorous analytical study of subdiffusion in nontrivial potentials a highly notrivial problem without exact analytical solutions .",
    "we approach it numerically by embedding the non - markovian subdiffusive dynamics as a markovian stochastic dynamics into the phase - space of higher dimensionality following to ref .",

    "it is in a sharp contrast with the normal diffusion case .",
    "for this reason , the dependence of the generalized peclet number on frequency just resembles the behavior of the absolute value of subcurrent in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .     and @xmath33 .",
    ", width=302 ]    , @xmath157 .",
    ", width=302 ]    the dependence of rectification current on the driving field amplitude @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath158 and @xmath157 .",
    "it displays the same quadratic nonlinear dependence on driving amplitude for a small driving strength as in normal ratchets @xcite .",
    "indeed , the rectification current can not be present within the linear response ( due to the onsager symmetry of kinetic coefficients ) .",
    "it first emerges as the lowest , second order nonlinear effect which is not forbidden by symmetry considerations .",
    "moreover , beyond perturbation theory the rectification current displays a very broad maximum for @xmath159 , in accord with intuition .",
    "in this work we put forward a model of subdiffusive brownian ratchets within the gle description .",
    "notably , a strict power law kernel is not required to reproduce subdiffusion on a very long time scale ( the theoretical asymptotics of normal diffusion for @xmath160 can not be even reached numerically on the available computers what makes it practically irrelevant in our simulations ) , and the markovian embedding dimension can be surprisingly small , allowing to accurately approximate nonlinear subdiffusive dynamics driven by gaussian @xmath161 noise .",
    "moreover , power law memory kernels with cutoffs are in fact more physical than strict power laws and their expansion over exponentials can reflect the corresponding relaxation spectrum of viscoelastic response of the surrounding medium .    the way we did this markovian embedding , i.e. approximating the fractional gaussian noise by a sum of ornstein - uhlenbeck processes is also insightful . in particular , it allows to justify the view of the escape dynamics out of a potential well as a rate process with non - markovian fluctuating rate , when the potential barrier exceeds @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "such an escape dynamics is asymptotically stretched exponential , but it tends gradually to a single - exponential with the increase of the potential barrier . then the rate fluctuations gradually vanish and for sufficiently high barriers ( exceeding e.g. @xmath88 for @xmath68 , and about @xmath89 for @xmath67 ) the escape dynamics is excellently approximated by the celebrated non - markovian rate expression @xcite , as it was shown by us recently @xcite .",
    "however , even for such high potential barriers , when the escape dynamics out of a potential well becomes practically exponential , the diffusion in a periodic potential is not normal , but anomalously slow .",
    "this is because of viscoelastic subdiffusion is based not on the anomaly of the residence time distributions ( i.e. divergent , or extremally large mean residence time , like in the case of ctrw subdiffusion and akin mechanisms ) , but on the long - time anti - correlations in the particle displacements ( and velocity alternations ) .",
    "this fact in combination with ergodicity makes gle subdiffusion physically much more appealing scenario , especially in biological applications where it can be combined with the quenched disorder due to the medium s inhomogeneity ( not necessarily leading alone to the emergence of subdiffusion ) .",
    "the subdiffusion in periodic potentials is described by some time - dependent @xmath134 which relaxes very slowly to @xmath4 .",
    "the time pace of this relaxation depends very essential on the potential amplitude @xcite , even if asymptotically this subdiffusion is not sensitive to the presence of potential @xcite because of the antipersistent , sluggish nature of this subdiffusion finally wins over thermally assisted hops between potential wells .",
    "the latter ones can take place quite frequently and do not provide a transport limiting step asymptotically ( a huge difference with the ctrw approach ! ) .",
    "this circumstance makes asymptotic ratchet effect impossible in the limit of adiabatically slow driving with vanishing driving frequency , @xmath8 . a somewhat similar suppression of the response to adiabatically slow driving",
    "was observed also in the non - markovian stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "it seems to be a general feature of the non - markovian dynamics with infinite memory which culminates in the death of linear ( and not only ! ) response in the case of subdiffusive ctrw and the associated fractional fokker - planck dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , for a finite @xmath34 the asymptotic anomalous current response of subdiffusive ratchet dynamics is present . in the lowest order of driving strength @xmath33",
    "it emerges as a nonlinear quadratic response to driving which violates the symmetry of thermal detailed balance in the absence of driving , for the unbiased potential .",
    "this is similar to the out of equilibrium physics of normal diffusion ratchets .",
    "the rectification current is optimized not only for a driving strength between two critical values @xmath162 and @xmath136 for the consider potential , but also versus @xmath34 and @xmath71 for the fixed temperature @xmath27 .",
    "this is because of the rectification current vanishes in all these limits : @xmath8 , @xmath128 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "the visual inspection of the single particle trajectories shows that the maximum of subvelocity versus @xmath34 corresponds to an optimal synchronization of the particle motions between potential wells and the potential tilts .",
    "this mechanism is somewhat similar to the current optimization for flashing , or pulsing normal diffusion ratchets @xcite .",
    "however , the physics is different . in our case ,",
    "the effect results because of the potential is not felt strongly by particles traveling large distances between the potential alternations . moreover , for sufficiently large frequencies particles subdiffuse in the counter - intuitive direction , i.e. the anomalous current inversion occurs , cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] . like",
    "in the case of normal diffusion rocking ratchets @xcite , this effect does not have a simple intuitive explanation .    to conclude , this work put forward a generalization of the pioneering contributions @xcite to the realm of subdiffusive brownian ratchets in viscoelastic media rocked by a periodic force .",
    "the author is confident that the bulk of future research on subdiffusive brownian ratchets is ahead because of their surprising and counter - intuitive features which call for experimental verification .",
