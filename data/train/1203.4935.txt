    "in estimating a multivariate normal mean , the usual @xmath0-dimensional @xmath1 confidence set is @xmath2 where we observe @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a random variable with a @xmath0-variate normal distribution with mean  @xmath5 and covariance matrix @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the @xmath9 identity matrix , and @xmath10 is the upper @xmath11 cutoff of a chi - squared distribution , satisfying @xmath12 .",
    "although the above formulation looks somewhat naive , it is very relevant in applications of the linear model , still one of the most widely - used statistical models .",
    "for such models , typical assumptions lead to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the least squares estimator ( and mle under normality ) , @xmath15 is the vector of regression slopes and @xmath16 is a known covariance matrix ( typically depending on the design matrix ) .",
    "the usual confidence set for @xmath15 is @xmath17 letting @xmath18 and @xmath19 reduces ( [ eq : usualregression])to  ( [ eq : usual ] ) .    in theoretical investigations of confidence sets and procedures",
    ", we often first take @xmath20 known .",
    "when @xmath20 is unknown , the usual strategy is to replace it by some usual estimator , such as the sample variance  @xmath21 . under normality , if @xmath21 has @xmath22 degrees of freedom , then @xmath23 , independent of @xmath14 .",
    "for example , the usual  @xmath24 confidence set for the regression parameters based on a linear model can be reduced to @xmath25 with the usual unbiased estimator @xmath21 substituted for @xmath20 .",
    "this is the usual scheff@xmath26 confidence set .",
    "unfortunately , contrary to the point estimation case , there are few theoretical results for unknown @xmath20 . however , there is continued numerical evidence that the usual confidence set can be dominated in the unknown variance case ( see , e.g. , casella and hwang , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , hwang and ullah ( @xcite ) argue that the domination of the alternative fixed radius confidence spheres for the unknown  @xmath20 case , over scheff s set , holds with a larger shrinkage factor .    since we are assuming that @xmath20 is known , we take it equal to @xmath27 and ( [ eq : usual ] ) becomes @xmath28    we now ask the question of whether it is possible to improve on @xmath29 in the sense of finding a confidence set @xmath30 such that , for all @xmath5 and @xmath31 :    @xmath32 ;    @xmath33 ;    with strict inequality holding in either ( i ) or ( ii ) for a set @xmath5 or @xmath31 with positive lebesgue measure .",
    "the answer to this question may be yes for higher dimensional cases , as suggested by the work of stein .",
    "the celebrated work of james and stein ( @xcite ) shows that the estimator @xmath34 dominates @xmath4 with respect to squared error loss if @xmath35 , that is , @xmath36 in practice , this estimator has the deficiency of a  singularity at @xmath37 in that @xmath38 .",
    "this deficiency can be corrected with the positive part estimator ( appearing in baranchik , @xcite , and mentioned as example 1 in baranchik , @xcite ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "this estimator actually improves on @xmath41 and is so good that , even though  it was known to be inadmissible , it took @xmath42 years  to find a dominating estimator ( shao and , @xcite ) .",
    "the removal of the singularity makes  @xmath43 a  more attractive candidate for centering a  confidence set .",
    "a simple proof of ( [ eq : jsdom ] ) can be found in stein ( @xcite ) ; see also lehmann and casella ( @xcite ) , chapter 5 .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to conjecture that we can use a stein estimator to dominate the confidence set @xmath29 .",
    "although this turns out to be the case , it is a very difficult problem .",
    "stein ( @xcite ) gave heuristic arguments argument and the fact that @xmath4 and @xmath44 are orthogonal as @xmath45 . ]",
    "that showed why recentered sets of the form @xmath46 for all  @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "( note that this set has the same volume as @xmath29 , but is recentered @xmath49 .",
    "dominance would thus be established if we can show that @xmath50 has higher coverage probability than @xmath29 . )",
    "stein s argument was heuristic , but brown ( @xcite ) and joshi ( @xcite ) proved the inadmissibility of @xmath51 if @xmath52 ( without giving an explicit dominating procedure ) .",
    "joshi ( @xcite ) also showed that @xmath53 was admissible if @xmath54 .",
    "the existence results of brown and joshi are based on spheres centered at @xmath55 [ compare to ( [ eq : jspos ] ) ] where @xmath56 is made arbitrarily small and @xmath57 is made arbitrarily large .",
    "but these existence results fall short of actually exhibiting a confidence set that dominates @xmath29 .",
    "the first analytical and constructive results were established by ( surprise ! ) hwang and casella ( @xcite ) , who studied the coverage probability of @xmath50 in ( [ eq : pospartset ] ) .",
    "since @xmath58 and @xmath29 have the same volume , domination will be established if it can be shown that @xmath50 has higher coverage probability for every value of @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to establish that :    * @xmath59 is only a function of @xmath60 , the euclidean norm of @xmath5 , and * @xmath61 , the coverage probability of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , to prove the dominance of @xmath50 , it is sufficient to show that the coverage probability is a nonincreasing function of @xmath60 .",
    "hwang and casella ( @xcite ) derived a formula for @xmath62 ( independent of @xmath5 ) such that if @xmath63 , @xmath50 dominates @xmath29 in coverage probability for @xmath64 .",
    "using a slightly different method of proof , hwang and casella ( @xcite ) extended the dominance to cover the case @xmath65 .",
    "this proof is outlined in appendix . the analytic proof was generalized to spherical symmetric distributions by hwang and chen ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is an interesting geometrical oddity associated with the stein recentered confidence set . to see this ,",
    "we first formalize our definitions of confidence sets . note that for any confidence set we can speak of the @xmath31-section and the @xmath5-section .",
    "that is , if we define a _ confidence procedure _ to be a set @xmath66 in the product space @xmath67 , then :    1 .",
    "the @xmath31-section , @xmath68 , is the confidence set .",
    "2 .   the @xmath5-section , @xmath69 , the acceptance region for the test @xmath70 .",
    "we then have the tautology that @xmath71 if and only if @xmath72 and , thus , we can evaluate the coverage probability @xmath73 by computing @xmath74 , which is often a more straightforward calculation .    for the usual confidence set ,",
    "both @xmath29 and @xmath75 are spheres , one centered at @xmath31 and one centered at @xmath5 .",
    "although the confidence set @xmath76 is a sphere , the associated @xmath5-section @xmath77 is not , and has the shape portrayed in figure [ fig : jsset ] . notice the flattening of the set in the side closer to @xmath37 in the direction perpendicular to  @xmath5 , and the slight expansion away from @xmath37 .",
    "stein ( @xcite ) knew of this flattening phenomenon , which he noted can be achieved in any fixed direction .",
    "what is interesting is that this reshaping of the @xmath5-section of the recentered set leads to a set with higher coverage probability than @xmath29 when @xmath78 .     and",
    "@xmath75 for @xmath79 , where @xmath75 is the sphere of radius @xmath80 centered at @xmath5 ( shaded ) .",
    "the set @xmath77 intersects @xmath75 at point @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( details on the points of intersection are in hwang and casella , @xcite ) .",
    "note the flattening of @xmath77 on the side toward the origin and the decrease in volume over @xmath75 . ]",
    "the improved confidence sets that we have discussed thus far have the property that their coverage probability is uniformly greater than that of  @xmath53 , but the infimum of the coverage probability ( the _ confidence coefficient _ ) is equal to that of @xmath53 .",
    "for example , recentered sets such as @xmath83 will present the same volume and confidence coefficient to an experimenter so , in practice , the experimenter has not gained anything .",
    "( this is , of course , a fallacy and a  shortcoming of the frequentist inference , which requires the reporting of the infimum of the coverage probability . )",
    "however , since the coverage probability of @xmath50 is uniformly higher than the infimum @xmath84 , it should be possible to reduce the radius of the recentered set and maintain dominance in coverage probability .",
    "in this section we describe some approaches to constructing improved confidence sets , approaches that not only result in a recentering of the usual set , but also try to reduce the radius ( or , more generally , the volume ) .",
    "some of these constructions are based on variations of bayesian highest posterior density regions , and thus share the problem of trying to describe exactly what the @xmath31-section , the confidence set , looks like .",
    "others are more of an empirical bayes approach , and tend to have more transparent geometry .",
    "the first attempt at constructing confidence sets with reduced volume considered sets with the same coverage probability as @xmath85 , but with uniformly smaller volume .",
    "one of the first attempts was that of faith ( @xcite ) , who considered a bayesian construction based on a two - stage prior where @xmath86 which is similar ( but not equal ) to the prior used by strawderman ( @xcite ) in the point estimation problem ( appendix ) .",
    "the two - stage prior amounts to a proper prior with density @xmath87 the multivariate @xmath88-distribution with @xmath89 degrees of  freedom .",
    "faith then derived the bayes decision against a linear loss , but modified it to the more explicitly defined region @xmath90 where @xmath80 is the radius of @xmath29 .",
    "it may happen that @xmath91 is not convex .",
    "however , if @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the convexity of @xmath91 was established .",
    "unfortunately , little else was established except when @xmath65 or @xmath94 , where for some ranges of @xmath56 and @xmath57 it was shown that @xmath91 has smaller volume and higher coverage probability than @xmath29 .",
    "berger ( @xcite ) took a different approach . using a  generalization of strawderman s prior",
    ", he calculated the posterior mean @xmath95 and posterior covariance matrix @xmath96 and recommended @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the upper @xmath11 cutoff point from a chi - square distribution with @xmath0 degrees of freedom . the posterior coverage probability would be exactly if the posterior distribution were normal , but this is not the case ( and the posterior coverage is not the frequentist coverage ) . however , berger was able to show that his set has very attractive coverage probability and small expected volume based on partly analytical and partly numerical evidence .",
    "a popular construction procedure for finding good point estimators is the empirical bayes approach ( see lehmann and casella , @xcite , section 4.6 , for an introduction ) , and proves to also be a useful tool in set construction .",
    "however , unlike the point estimation problem , where a direct application of empirical bayes arguments led to improved stein - type estimators ( see , e.g. , efron and morris , @xcite ) , in the confidence set problem we find that a straightforward implementation of an empirical bayes argument would not result in a @xmath1 confidence set .",
    "modifications are necessary to achieve dominance of the usual confidence set .",
    "suppose that we begin with a traditional normal prior at the first stage , and have the model @xmath99 which results in the bayesian highest posterior density ( hpd ) region @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the bayes point estimator of @xmath5 .",
    "this follows from the classical bayesian result that @xmath103 .",
    "however , for a fixed value of @xmath104 , the set @xmath105 can not have frequentist coverage probability above @xmath1 for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is easily seen , as the posterior coverage is identically @xmath1 for all @xmath31 , and , hence , the double integral over @xmath31 and @xmath5 is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the frequentist coverage is either equal to @xmath1 for all @xmath5 , or goes above and below @xmath1 . since the former case does not hold ( check @xmath106 and a nonzero value ) , the coverage probability of @xmath105 is not always above @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , if we take a naive approach and replace @xmath107 by a reasonable estimate , an empirical bayes approach , we can not expect that such a set would maintain frequentist coverage above @xmath1 .",
    "this is because such a set would have coverage probabilities converging to those of @xmath105 ( as the sample size increases ) and , hence , such an empirical bayes set would inherit the poor coverage probability of  @xmath105 .",
    "this phenomenon has been documented in casella and hwang ( @xcite ) .    as an alternative to the naive empirical bayes approach ,",
    "consider a decision - theoretic approach with a loss function to measure the loss of estimating the parameter @xmath5 with the set @xmath108 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a constant , @xmath111 is the volume of the set  @xmath108 , and @xmath112 is the indicator function .",
    "starting with a prior distribution @xmath113 , the bayes rule against @xmath114 is the set @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the posterior distribution .",
    "this is a  highest posterior density ( hpd ) region .",
    "the choice of @xmath110 is somewhat critical , and we chose it to coincide with properties of @xmath117 . specifically , if we chose @xmath118 , then @xmath117 is minimax for the loss ( [ eq : loss ] ) .",
    "an alternative explanation of this choice of @xmath110 is based on the reasoning that as @xmath119 , ( [ eq : hdregion ] ) would converge to @xmath117 , which insures that the alternative intervals would not become inferior to @xmath120 for large @xmath107 .",
    "( see he , @xcite ; qiu and hwang , @xcite ; and hwang , qiu and zhao , @xcite . )",
    "applying this choice of @xmath110 with the normal prior @xmath121 yields the bayes set @xmath122\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are as in ( [ eq : hpd ] ) . by estimating the hyperparameters , this is then converted to an empirical bayes set @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the positive part estimator of ( [ eq : jspos ] ) , and @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } \\cdot\\biggl[c^2-p\\log \\biggl(1-\\frac{p-2}{\\max(|x|^2 , c^2)}\\biggr)\\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath129 , a minor condition requiring @xmath130 , @xmath131 \\uparrow c^2 $ ] as @xmath132 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath127 is bounded away from zero .",
    "this is important in maintaining coverage probability .",
    "extensive numerical evidence was given ( casella and hwang , @xcite ) to support the claim that @xmath133 is a  uniform improvement over @xmath134 .",
    "confidence sets with exact @xmath1 coverage probability , with uniformly smaller volume , have also been constructed by tseng and brown ( @xcite ) , adapting results from brown et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these confidence sets are shown , numerically , to typically have smaller volume that those of berger ( @xcite ) .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , working on the problem of bioequivalence , start with the inversion of an @xmath11-level test and derive a @xmath1 confidence interval that minimizes a bayes expected volume , that is , the volume averaged with respect to both @xmath31 and @xmath5 .",
    "tseng and brown ( @xcite ) , using a normal prior @xmath135 , show that the corresponding set of brown et al .",
    "( @xcite ) becomes @xmath136 where @xmath137 is chosen so that @xmath138 has exactly @xmath1 coverage probability for every @xmath5 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the squared term in @xmath138 has a noncentral chi squared distribution , so @xmath137 is the appropriate @xmath11 cutoff point . in doing this ,",
    "tseng and brown avoided the problem of casella and hwang ( @xcite ) , and the radius does not need to be truncated .    of course , to be usable , we must estimate @xmath107",
    ". the typical empirical bayes approach would be to replace @xmath107 with an estimate , a function of @xmath31 .",
    "however , tseng and brown take a different approach and replace @xmath107 with a function of @xmath5 , thereby maintaining the @xmath1 coverage probability .",
    "they argue that @xmath5 is more directly related to @xmath104 than is @xmath31 , and should provide a better `` estimator . ''",
    "examples of this approach are discussed in hwang ( @xcite ) and huwang ( @xcite ) .",
    "the set proposed by tseng and brown is @xmath139 and @xmath140 , and has coverage exactly equal to @xmath1 for every @xmath5 . combining analytical results and numerical calculations ,",
    "these sets are shown to have uniformly smaller volume that @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , tseng and brown also demonstrate volume reductions over the sets of berger ( @xcite ) and casella and hwang ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only quibble with their approach is that the exact form of the set is not explicit , and can only be solved numerically .",
    "the first confidence set analytically proven to have smaller volume and higher coverage than @xmath29 is that of shinozaki ( @xcite ) .",
    "shinozaki worked with the @xmath31-section of the confidence set , starting with the set  @xmath29 .",
    "consider figure [ fig : jsset ] , but drawn as the @xmath31-section centered at @xmath31 . by shrinking @xmath141 toward the origin",
    ", he was able to construct a new set with the same coverage probability as @xmath29 but smaller volume .",
    "these sets can have a substantial improvement over @xmath29 , but smaller improvements compared to berger ( @xcite ) and casella and hwang ( @xcite ) ( especially when @xmath0 is large and @xmath142 is small ) .",
    "moreover , there is no point estimator that is explicitly associated with this set .",
    "samworth ( @xcite ) looked at confidence sets of the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the positive part estimator ( [ eq : jspos ] ) , @xmath145 is the appropriate @xmath11-level cutoff to give the confidence set coverage probability @xmath1 for all @xmath5 , and  @xmath4 has a  spherically symmetric distribution .",
    "he then replaced  @xmath145 by its taylor expansion @xmath146 and , replacing @xmath5 with @xmath31 , arrived at the confidence set @xmath147 samworth noted the importance of the quantity@xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the density of @xmath31 ( the relative increasing rate of @xmath149 at @xmath10 ) .",
    "the radius of the analytic confidence set only depends on the density through @xmath10 and @xmath150 .",
    "this point was previously noted by hwang and chen ( @xcite ) and robert and casella ( @xcite ) .",
    "this confidence set compares favorably with that of casella and hwang ( @xcite ) , having smaller volume especially when @xmath151 is small .",
    "numerical results were given not only for the normal distribution , but also for other spherically symmetric distributions such as the multivariate @xmath88 and the double exponential .",
    "furthermore , a parametric bootstrap confidence set is also proposed , which also performs well .",
    "efron ( @xcite ) studies the problem of confidence set construction with the goal of minimizing volume .",
    "he ultimately shows that seeking to minimize volume may not be the best way to improve inferences , and that relocating the set is more important than shrinking it . using a unique construction based on a polar decomposition of the normal density",
    ", efron derived a `` confidence density '' which he used to construct sets with @xmath1 coverage probability , and ultimately a minimum volume confidence set with @xmath1 posterior probability .    the confidence density , which plays a large part in efron s paper , is used to show the importance of locating the confidence set properly .",
    "the sets of tseng and brown ( @xcite ) and casella and hwang ( @xcite ) perform well on this evaluation .",
    "a minimum volume construction is also derived , and it is shown that the resulting set is not optimal in any inferential sense .",
    "inferential properties , similar to type i and type ii errors , are explored .",
    "it is also seen that as the relocated sets decrease volume of the confidence set , they _ increase _ the acceptance regions .",
    "thus far , we have only addressed the problem of improving confidence regions for the mean .",
    "however , there is also a stein effect for the estimation of the variance , and this can be exploited to produce improved confidence intervals for the variance .",
    "stein ( @xcite ) was the first to notice this ( of course ! ) .",
    "specifically , let @xmath152 be i.i.d .",
    "@xmath153 , univariate , where both @xmath154 and @xmath155 are unknown , and calculate @xmath156 and @xmath157 . against squared error loss , the best estimator of @xmath20 , of the form @xmath158 , has @xmath159 .",
    "this is also the best equivariant estimator [ with the location - scale group and the equivariant loss @xmath160 , and is minimax .",
    "stein showed that the estimator @xmath161 uniformly dominates @xmath162 .",
    "notice that @xmath163 converges to @xmath162 if @xmath164 is big , but shrinks the estimator toward zero if it is small .",
    "stein s proof was quite innovative ( and is reproduced in the review paper by maatta and casella , @xcite ) . the proof is based on looking at the conditional expectation of the risk function , conditioning on @xmath165 , and showing that moving the usual estimator toward zero moves to a lower point on the quadratic risk surface .",
    "this approach was extended by brown ( @xcite ) to establish inadmissibility results , and by brewster and zidek ( @xcite ) , who found the best scale equivariant estimator .",
    "minimax estimators were also found by strawderman ( @xcite ) , using a different technique .    turning to intervals , building on the techniques developed by stein and brown , cohen ( @xcite ) exhibited a confidence interval for the variance that improved on the usual confidence interval .",
    "if @xmath166 is the shortest @xmath1 confidence interval based on @xmath167 ( tate and klett , @xcite ) , cohen ( @xcite ) considered the confidence interval @xmath168 where @xmath112 is the indicator function , @xmath169 , so each piece has the same length , but @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "so if @xmath164 is small , the interval is pulled toward zero , analogous to the behavior of the stein point estimator .",
    "shorrack ( @xcite ) built on this argument , and those of brewster and  zidek ( @xcite ) , to construct a generalized bayes confidence interval that smoothly shifts toward zero , keeping the same length as the usual interval but uniformly increasing coverage probability .",
    "building further on these arguments , goutis and casella ( @xcite ) constructed generalized bayes intervals that smoothly shifted the usual interval toward zero , reducing its length but maintaining the same coverage probability .",
    "for more recent developments on variance estimation see kubokawa and srivastava ( @xcite ) and maruyama and strawderman ( @xcite ) .",
    "in some applications there may be interest in making inference individually for each @xmath172 .",
    "one example is the analysis of microarray data in which the interest is to determine which genes are differentially expressed ( i.e. , having @xmath172 , the difference of the true expression between the treatment group and the control group , different from zero ) .",
    "although the confidence sets of the previous section can be projected to obtain confidence intervals , that will typically lead to wider intervals than a direct construction .    if @xmath173 are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath174 , @xmath175 , the usual one - dimensional interval is @xmath176 where @xmath80 is chosen so that the coverage probability is @xmath1 .",
    "hence , @xmath80 is the @xmath177 upper quantile of a  standard normal .",
    "if a frequentist criterion is used , it is not possible to simultaneously improve on the length and coverage probability of @xmath178 in one dimension .",
    "however , it is possible to do so if an empirical bayes criterion is used .",
    "morris ( @xcite ) defined an empirical bayes confidence region with respect to a class of priors @xmath179 , having confidence coefficient @xmath1 to be a set @xmath180 satisfying @xmath181    note that @xmath182 is the bayes coverage probability in that both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are integrated out . using normal priors with both equal and unequal variance , morris went on to construct @xmath1 empirical bayes confidence intervals that have average ( across @xmath183 ) squared lengths smaller than @xmath184 .",

    "the approach he took is similar to the approach of casella and hwang ( @xcite ) , using a one - dimensional loss function similar to the linear loss ( [ eq : loss ] ) except that @xmath5 is replaced by only the component @xmath172 of interest . as in the discussion following ( [ eq : loss ] ) , @xmath110 and @xmath80 need to be properly linked .",
    "with such a choice of @xmath110 , the decision bayes interval is then approximated by its empirical bayes counterpart : @xmath190 here @xmath191 is the @xmath183th component of the james  stein positive part estimator ( [ eq : jspos ] ) with @xmath192 , @xmath193 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber \\hat m&=&\\max\\biggl\\ { \\biggl(1-\\frac{p-2}{|x|^2}\\biggr)^+,\\frac { 1}{p-1}\\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note the resemblance to ( [ eq : ppv ] ) .",
    "there is also a truncation carried out in the definition of @xmath194 so that @xmath195 is bounded away from zero .",
    "it can be shown that the length of @xmath196 is always smaller than that of @xmath184 for each individual coordinate , @xmath183  as long as @xmath197 , or , equivalently , @xmath198 .",
    "in contrast , in morris ( @xcite ) only the average length across @xmath183 was made smaller .",
    "numerical studies in he ( @xcite ) demonstrated that his interval is an empirical bayes confidence interval with @xmath1 confidence coefficient .",
    "also , on average , it has shorter length than the intervals of morris ( @xcite ) or laird and louis ( @xcite ) when @xmath199 or @xmath200 .",
    "he concluded that his interval is recommended only if @xmath201 .",
    "interestingly , in modern application with the concerns of multiple testings , a small value of @xmath11 is more important .",
    "an important problem in statistics is to address the confidence estimation problem after selecting a  subset of populations from a larger set .",
    "this is especially so if the number @xmath0 of populations is huge and the number of selected populations , @xmath110 , is relatively small , a scenario typical in microarray experiments . for example , ignoring the selection and just estimating the parameters of the selected populations by the sample means would have serious bias , especially if the populations selected are the ones with largest corresponding sample means . in such a  situation , intuition would suggest that some kind of shrinkage approach is very much needed .",

    "in particular , @xmath211 is not necessarily the largest of the @xmath204 s .",
    "it is just that @xmath204 happens to have produced the largest observations among the @xmath173 s .    in the point estimation problem ,",
    "the naive estimator of @xmath211 is @xmath212 , which can be intuitively seen to be an overestimate , especially if all @xmath172 are equal .",
    "a  shrinkage estimator adapted to this situation would seem more reasonable .",
    "hwang ( @xcite ) was able to show that for estimating @xmath211 , a variation of the positive - part estimator ( [ eq : jspos ] ) , with @xmath173 replaced by @xmath213 , has , for every @xmath154 and @xmath107 , smaller bayes risk than @xmath213 with respect to one - dimensional squared error loss",
    ".    for the construction of confidence intervals , qiu and hwang ( @xcite ) adapted the approach of casella and hwang ( @xcite ) and he ( @xcite ) to this problem . for any selection , they constructed @xmath1 empirical bayes confidence intervals for @xmath203 which are shown numerically to have confidence coefficient @xmath1 when @xmath214 is either known or estimable . moreover , the interval is everywhere shorter than even the traditional interval , @xmath215 , which does not maintain @xmath1 coverage in this case .",
    "interestingly , in one microarray data set , qiu and hwang ( @xcite ) found that the normal prior did not fit the data as well as a mixture of a normal prior and a point mass at zero .",
    "for the mixture prior , an empirical bayes confidence interval for @xmath203 was constructed and shown ( numerically and asymptotically as @xmath216 to have empirical bayes confidence coefficient at least @xmath1 .",
    "further , combining @xmath110 empirical bayes @xmath217 confidence intervals for @xmath203 , @xmath218 , where @xmath219 consists of  @xmath110 indices of the selected @xmath203 s , yields a simultaneous confidence set ( rectangle ) that has empirical bayes coverage probability above the nominal @xmath1 level .",
    "furthermore , their sizes could be much smaller than even the naive rectangles ( which ignore selection and hence have poor coverage ) .",
    "this can also lead to a  more powerful test .",
    "thus far , we have only discussed procedures that shrink the sample means , however , confidence sets can also be improved by shrinking variances . in section [ sec : varshrink ] we saw how to construct improved intervals for the variance . in berry ( @xcite ) it was shown that using an improved variance estimator can slightly improve the risk of the stein point estimator ( but not the positive - part ) .",
    "now we will see that we can substantially improve intervals for the mean by using improved variance estimates , when there area  large number of variances involved .",
    "hwang , qiu and zhao ( @xcite ) constructed empirical bayes confidence intervals for @xmath172 where the center and the length of the interval are found by shrinking both the sample means and sample variances .",
    "they took an approach similar to he ( @xcite ) , except that the task is complicated by putting yet another prior on @xmath220 .",
    "the prior assumption is that @xmath221 is distributed according to a normal distribution ( or  @xmath220 has an inverted gamma distribution ) . in both cases ,",
    "their proposed double shrinkage confidence interval maintains empirical bayes coverage probabilities above the nominal level , while the expected length are always smaller than the @xmath88-interval or the interval that only shrinks means .",
    "simulations show that the improvements could be up to 50% .",
    "the confidence intervals constructed are shown to have empirical bayes confidence coefficient close to @xmath1 . in all the numerical studies , including extensive simulation and the application to the data sets , the double shrinkage procedure performed better than the single shrinkage intervals ( intervals that shrink only one of the sample means or sample variances but not both ) and the standard @xmath88 interval ( where there is no shrinkage ) .",
    "the confidence sets that we have discussed broadly fall into two categories : those that are explicitly defined by a center and a radius ( such as berger , @xcite , or casella and hwang , @xcite ) , and those that are implicit ( such as tseng and brown , @xcite ) . for experimenters ,",
    "the explicitly defined intervals may be slightly preferred .",
    "the improved confidence sets typically work because they are able to reduce the volume of the @xmath31-section ( the confidence set ) without reducing the volume of the @xmath5-section ( the acceptance region ) . as the coverage probability results from the @xmath5-section ,",
    "the result is an improved set in terms of volume and coverage .",
    "another point to note is that most of the sets presented are based on shrinking toward zero .",
    "moreover , the improved sets will typically have greatest coverage improvement near zero , that is , near the point to which they are shrinking .",
    "the point zero is , of course , only a convenience , as we can shrink toward any point @xmath222 by translating the problem to @xmath223 and @xmath224 , and then obtain the greatest confidence improvement when @xmath223 is small .",
    "moreover , we can shrink toward any linear subset of the parameter space , for example , the space where the coordinates are all equal , by translating to @xmath225 and @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is a vector of @xmath27s .",
    "this is developed in casella and hwang ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stein effect , which was discovered in point estimation , has had far - reaching influence in confidence set estimation .",
    "it has shown us that by taking into account the structure of a problem , possibly through an empirical bayes model , improved point and set estimators can be constructed .",
    "hwang and casella ( @xcite ) show that @xmath229 is decreasing in @xmath60 , and hence has minimum @xmath1 at @xmath230 .",
    "the proof is somewhat complex , and only holds for @xmath64 .",
    "hwang and casella ( @xcite ) found a simpler approach , which extended the result to @xmath65 .",
    "we outline that approach here .    for the set @xmath231",
    ", the following lemma shows that we do not have to worry about @xmath232 .    for @xmath233 and every @xmath187 and @xmath232 , @xmath234",
    "the assumption @xmath232 implies that @xmath235 , the @xmath236-section ( acceptance region ) .",
    "therefore , by the convexity of @xmath75 , @xmath237 since @xmath238 is a convex combination of @xmath37 and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , since @xmath239 , we then have @xmath240 so @xmath241 and the theorem is proved .",
    "it is interesting that , even though the confidence sets ( the @xmath31-sections ) have exactly the same volume ; for small @xmath5 the @xmath5-section of the @xmath49 procedure contains the @xmath5-section of the usual procedure .",
    "in addition to not needing to worry about @xmath242 , there is a further simplification if @xmath243 . if @xmath243 , the inequality @xmath244 is equivalent to @xmath245 which allows us to drop the `` @xmath246 . ''",
    "note that if @xmath247 and @xmath248 , then @xmath249 .",
    "last , we note that if @xmath250 , then the two procedures are exactly the same and , thus , a sufficient condition for domination of @xmath29 by @xmath251 is to show that @xmath252 for every @xmath79 and @xmath56 in an interval including @xmath37 .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : hcsufficient ] ) was established in hwang and casella ( @xcite ) through the use of the polar transformation @xmath253 , where @xmath254 and latexmath:[$x^\\prime\\theta=     @xmath31 and @xmath5 .",
    "the polar representation of the coverage probability is differentiable in @xmath56 , and the following theorem was established .    for @xmath78 ,",
    "the coverage probability of @xmath50 is higher than that of @xmath29 for every @xmath5 provided @xmath256 , where @xmath257 is the unique solution to @xmath258    solutions to this equation are easily computed , and it turns out that @xmath259 , which does not quite get to the value @xmath260 , the optimal value for @xmath261 and the popular choice for @xmath262 .",
    "however , the coverage probabilities are very close",
    ". moreover , the theorem provides a sufficient condition , and it is no doubt the case that @xmath192 achieves dominance .",
    "the first proper bayes minimax point estimators were found by strawderman ( @xcite ) using a hierarchical prior of the form @xmath263    the bayes estimator for this model is @xmath264x$ ] . the function @xmath265 is a bounded increasing function of @xmath151 , and strawderman was able to show , using an extension of baranchik s ( @xcite ) result , that for @xmath266 the bayes estimator is minimax .",
    "an interesting point about this hierarchy is that the unconditional prior on @xmath5 is approximately @xmath267 and @xmath268 , leading to an unconditional prior on @xmath5 of the form @xmath269 , the multivariate @xmath88 distribution . in his unpublished ph.d .",
    "thesis , faith gave strong evidence that the bayesian posterior credible sets had good coverage properties .",
    "berger ( @xcite ) used a generalization of strawderman s prior , which is more tractable than the @xmath88 prior of faith , to allow for input on the covariance structure .",
