    "a widely accepted mechanism to explain color confinement in @xmath0 yang - mills theories is based on the dual superconductivity picture @xcite , according to which the low energy regime of qcd should be described by an effective abelian theory in the presence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "these monopoles should condense , giving rise to a string formation @xmath2 la abrikosov - nielsen - olesen . as a result , chromoelectric charges are confined .",
    "this mechanism has received many confirmations from the lattice community in the so - called abelian gauges , which are useful in order to isolate the effective relevant degrees of freedom at low energy .    according to the concept of abelian dominance",
    ", the low energy region of qcd can be expressed solely in terms of abelian degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "lattice confirmations of the abelian dominance can be found in @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting abelian gauge is the maximal abelian gauge ( mag ) , introduced in @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "the mag is obtained by minimizing the square of the norm of the fields corresponding to off - diagonal gluons , i.e. the gluons associated with the @xmath3 off - diagonal generators of @xmath0 . doing so , there is a residual @xmath4 abelian gauge freedom corresponding to the cartan subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "the renormalizability in the continuum of this gauge was proven in @xcite , at the cost of introducing a quartic ghost interaction .    to our knowledge",
    ", there is no analytic proof of the abelian dominance .",
    "nevertheless , an argument that can be interpreted as evidence of it , is the fact that the off - diagonal gluons would attain a dynamical mass . at energies below the scale set by this mass",
    ", the off - diagonal gluons should decouple , and in this way one should end up with an abelian theory at low energies .",
    "a lattice study of such an off - diagonal gluon mass reported a value of approximately @xmath5gev @xcite .",
    "more recently , the off - diagonal gluon propagator was investigated numerically in @xcite , reporting a similar result .",
    "there have been several efforts to give an analytic description of the mechanism responsible for the dynamical generation of the off - diagonal gluon mass . in @xcite ,",
    "a certain ghost condensate was used to construct an effective , off - diagonal mass . however , in @xcite it was shown that the obtained mass was a tachyonic one , a fact confirmed later in @xcite .",
    "another condensation , namely that of the mixed gluon - ghost operator @xmath6 , runs only over the @xmath3 off - diagonal generators . ] that could be responsible for the off - diagonal mass , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "that this operator should condense can be expected on the basis of a close analogy existing between the mag and the renormalizable nonlinear curci - ferrari gauge @xcite .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the mixed gluon - ghost operator can be introduced also in the curci - ferrari gauge .",
    "a detailed analysis of its condensation and of the ensuing dynamical mass generation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate explicitly if the mass dimension two operator @xmath6 condenses , so that a dynamical off - diagonal mass is generated in the mag .",
    "the pathway we intend to follow is based on previous research in this direction in other gauges . in @xcite ,",
    "the local composite operator ( lco ) technique was used to construct a renormalizable effective potential for the operator @xmath7 in the landau gauge . as a consequence of @xmath8 , the gauge bosons acquired a mass @xcite .",
    "the fact that gluons in the landau gauge become massive has received confirmations from lattice simulations , see for example @xcite .",
    "recently , the dynamical mass generation in the landau gauge has been investigated within the schwinger - dyson formalism in @xcite .",
    "the condensate @xmath9 has attracted attention from theoretical @xcite as well as from the lattice side @xcite .",
    "it was shown by means of the algebraic renormalization technique @xcite that the lco formalism for the condensate @xmath10 is renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the same formalism was successfully employed to study the condensation of @xmath11 in the curci - ferrari gauge @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that the landau gauge corresponds to @xmath12 .",
    "later on , the condensation of @xmath7 was confirmed in the linear covariant gauges @xcite , which also possess the landau gauge as a special case .",
    "it was proven formally that the vacuum energy does not depend on the gauge parameter .",
    "however , in practice , a problem occurred due to the mixing of different orders of perturbation theory , when solving the gap equation for the condensate .",
    "nevertheless , we have been able to present a way to overcome this problem @xcite . as a result",
    ", it turns out that the non - trivial vacuum energy due to the condensate @xmath9 in the landau gauge coincides with the non - trivial vacuum energy due to the appropriate mass dimension two condensate in the linear covariant gauges , @xmath9 , and the curci - ferrari gauge , @xmath13 , since these two classes of gauges both have the landau gauge , @xmath14 , as a limiting case .",
    "we would also like to underline that the concept of a gluon mass has already been widely used in a more phenomenological context since long ago , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "more recently , a gluon mass of the order of a few hundred mev has been proven to be very useful in describing the radiative decay of heavy quarkonia systems @xcite as well as to derive estimates of the glueball spectrum @xcite .    to make this paper",
    "self - contained , we will explain all necessary steps in the case of the mag , and refer to the previous papers for more details where appropriate . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the mag and discuss its renormalizability when the operator @xmath15 is introduced in the theory .",
    "we briefly review how the effective potential is constructed by means of the lco technique . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the independence of the vacuum energy from the gauge parameter of the mag .",
    "we face the problem of the mixing of different orders in perturbation theory , and we provide a solution of it . in section iv , we construct a generalized renormalizable gauge that interpolates between the mag and the landau gauge .",
    "moreover , we will also show that there exists a generalized renormalizable mass dimension two operator that interpolates between the mass dimension two operators of the mag and of the landau gauge .",
    "this can be used to prove that the vacuum energy obtained in the mag is the same as that of the landau gauge . in section",
    "v , we present explicit results , obtained in the case of @xmath16 and to the one loop approximation .",
    "we end with conclusions in section vi .",
    "let @xmath17 be the lie algebra valued connection for the gauge group @xmath0 , whose generators @xmath18 , satisfying @xmath19 $ ]  @xmath20  @xmath21 , are chosen to be antihermitean and to obey the orthonormality condition @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "one has @xmath24 .",
    "we decompose the gauge field into its off - diagonal and diagonal parts , namely @xmath25 where the indices @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 label the @xmath29 generators of the cartan subalgebra .",
    "the remaining @xmath3 off - diagonal generators will be labelled by the indices @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath28 . for further use",
    ", we recall the jacobi identity @xmath32 from which it can be deduced that @xmath33 the field strength decomposes as @xmath34 with the off - diagonal and diagonal parts given respectively by @xmath35 where the covariant derivative @xmath36 is defined with respect to the diagonal components @xmath37 @xmath38 for the yang - mills action one obtains @xmath39 the so called mag gauge condition amounts to fixing the value of the covariant derivative , @xmath40 , of the off - diagonal components by requiring that the functional @xmath41=(vt)^{-1}\\int d^4x\\left(a_\\mu^a a^{\\mu a}\\right)\\;,\\ ] ] attains a minimum with respect to the local gauge transformations .",
    "this corresponds to imposing @xmath42 however , this condition being non - linear implies a quartic ghost self - interaction term is required for renormalizability purposes .",
    "the corresponding gauge fixing term turns out to be @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mag gauge parameter and @xmath45 denotes the nilpotent brst operator , acting as @xmath46 here @xmath47 are the off - diagonal and the diagonal components of the faddeev - popov ghost field , while @xmath48 are the off - diagonal antighost and lagrange multiplier .",
    "we also observe that the brsttransformations @xmath49 have been obtained by their standard form upon projection on the off - diagonal and diagonal components of the fields .",
    "we remark that the mag ( [ smn ] ) can be written in the form @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the nilpotent anti - brst transformation , acting as @xmath52 it can be checked that @xmath45 and @xmath51 anticommute .",
    "expression @xmath53 is easily worked out and yields @xmath54 we note that @xmath12 does in fact correspond to the `` real '' mag condition , given by eq.([magdiff ] ) .",
    "however , one can not set @xmath12 from the beginning since this would lead to a nonrenormalizable gauge .",
    "some of the terms proportional to @xmath55 would reappear due to radiative corrections , even if @xmath12 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite . for our purposes , this means that we have to keep @xmath55 general throughout and leave to the end the analysis of the limit @xmath56 , to recover condition ( [ magdiff ] ) .",
    "the mag condition allows for a residual local @xmath4 invariance with respect to the diagonal subgroup . in order to have a complete quantization of the theory",
    ", one has to fix this abelian gauge freedom by means of a suitable further gauge condition on the diagonal components @xmath37 of the gauge field .",
    "a common choice for the abelian gauge fixing , also adopted in the lattice papers @xcite , is the landau gauge , given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the diagonal antighost and lagrange multiplier .      in order to write down a suitable set of ward identities , we first introduce external fields",

    "i , the dimension and ghost number of all the fields and sources are listed .",
    ".dimension and ghost number . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we are now ready to write down the ward identities needed to discuss the renormalizability of the model .",

    "use has been made of the jacobi identities ( [ jacobi2 ] ) .",
    "we mention that all the classical ward identities of the previous section can be extended to all orders of perturbation theory without encountering anomalies . in principle ,",
    "this can be proven by means of the algebraic setup of @xcite and of the general results on the brst cohomology of gauge theories @xcite .",
    "it can be understood in a simple way by observing that pure yang - mills theory in the mag can be regularized in a gauge invariant way by employing dimensional regularization .    in order to characterize the most general invariant counterterm which can be freely added to all orders of perturbation theory , we perturb the classical action @xmath74 by adding an arbitrary integrated local polynomial @xmath89 in the fields and external sources of dimension bounded by four and with zero ghost number , and we require that the perturbed action @xmath90 satisfies the same ward identities as @xmath74 to the first order in the perturbation parameter @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 this amounts to imposing the following conditions on @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the nilpotent linearized operator @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 > from the conditions @xmath99 and @xmath100 , it turns out that the most general invariant counterterm can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is an integrated local polynomial with ghost number @xmath103 , given by @xmath104 we see thus that @xmath89 contains six free independent parameters , namely @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "these parameters can be reabsorbed by means of a multiplicative renormalization of the gauge coupling constant @xmath111 , of the gauge and lco parameters @xmath44 , @xmath69 , and of the fields @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and sources @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath62 , @xmath61 , @xmath82 , @xmath122 , according to @xmath123 with @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath132 in particular , from eq.@xmath133,@xmath134 one sees that the renormalization of the source @xmath135 , and thus of the composite operator @xmath84 , can be expressed in terms of the renormalization of gauge coupling constant and of the diagonal ghost .",
    "this property follows from the diagonal ghost equation @xmath136 and from the the integrated @xmath82-equation @xmath137 . in particular , for the anomalous dimension of the gluon - ghost operator @xmath84 , we obtain @xcite @xmath138 with @xmath139      we present here the main steps in the construction of the effective potential for a local composite operator .",
    "a more detailed account of the lco formalism can be found in @xcite .    to obtain the effective potential for the condensate @xmath140",
    ", we set the sources @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 to zero and consider the renormalized generating functional @xmath146\\exp is(j)\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{d2 }      s(j)&=&s_{\\mathrm{ym}}+s_{\\mathrm{mag}}+s_{\\mathrm{diag}}+s_{\\mathrm{count}}+\\int d^{4}x \\left(z_jj\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\widetilde{z}_a a_\\mu^a a^{\\mu a}+z_{\\alpha}\\widetilde{z}_c{\\alpha}{\\overline{c}}^a c^a\\right)+(\\zeta+\\delta\\zeta)\\frac{j^2}{2}\\right)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 denotes the relevant fields and @xmath148 is the usual counterterm contribution , i.e. the part without the composite operator .",
    "the quantity @xmath149 is the counterterm accounting for the divergences proportional to @xmath150 . using dimensional regularization throughout with the convention that @xmath151",
    ", one has the following identification @xmath152 the functional @xmath153 obeys the renormalization group equation ( rge ) @xmath154 where @xmath155 > from eq.([rge5 ] ) , one finds @xmath156 with @xmath157 up to now , the lco parameter @xmath158 is still an arbitrary coupling . as explained in @xcite , simply setting @xmath159 would give rise to an inhomogeneous rge for @xmath153 @xmath160 and a non - linear rge for the associated effective action @xmath161 for the composite operator @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , multiplicative renormalizability is lost and by varying the value of @xmath149 , minima of the effective action can change into maxima or can get lost .",
    "however , @xmath158 can be made such a function of @xmath162 and @xmath55 so that , if @xmath162 runs according to @xmath163 and @xmath55 according to @xmath164 , @xmath165 will run according to its rge ( [ rge6 ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished by setting @xmath158 equal to the solution of the differential equation @xmath166 doing so , @xmath153 obeys the homogeneous renormalization group equation @xmath167 to lighten the notation , we will drop the renormalization factors from now on .",
    "one will notice that there are terms quadratic in the source @xmath135 present in @xmath168 , obscuring the usual energy interpretation .",

    "this could have been established already from the local @xmath4 ward identity ( [ wi ] ) .",
    "we begin this section with a few remarks on the determination of @xmath165 . from explicit calculations in perturbation theory , it will become clear that the rge functions showing up in the differential equation ( [ rge9 ] ) look like @xmath179 as such , eq.([rge9 ] ) can be solved by expanding @xmath165 in a laurent series in @xmath162 , @xmath180 more precisely , for the first coefficients @xmath181 , @xmath182 of the expression ( [ ga2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath183 notice that , in order to construct the @xmath184-loop effective potential , knowledge of the @xmath185-loop rge functions is needed .",
    "the effective potential calculated with the lagrangian ( [ rge12 ] ) will explicitly depend on the gauge parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the question arises concerning the vacuum energy @xmath186 , ( i.e. the effective potential evaluated at its minimum ) ; will it be independent of the choice of @xmath55 ?",
    "also , as it can be seen from the equations ( [ rge21a ] ) , each @xmath187 is determined through a first order differential equation in @xmath55 .",
    "firstly , one has to solve for @xmath188 .",
    "this will introduce one arbitrary integration constant @xmath189 . using the obtained value for @xmath188",
    ", one can consequently solve the first order differential equation for @xmath190 .",
    "this will introduce a second integration constant @xmath191 , etc . in principle , it is possible that these arbitrary constants influence the vacuum energy , which would represent an unpleasant feature .",
    "notice that the differential equations in @xmath55 for the @xmath192 are due to the running of @xmath55 in eq.([rge9 ] ) , encoded in the renormalization group function @xmath164 .",
    "assume that we would have already shown that @xmath186 does not depend on the choice of @xmath55 .",
    "if we then set @xmath193 , with @xmath194 a fixed point of the rge for @xmath55 at the considered order of perturbation theory , then equation ( [ rge9 ] ) determining @xmath158 simplifies to @xmath195 since @xmath196 this will lead to simple algebraic equations for the @xmath197 .",
    "hence , no integration constants will enter the final result for the vacuum energy for @xmath193 , and since @xmath186 does not depend on @xmath55 , @xmath186 will never depend on the integration constants , even when calculated for a general @xmath55 .",
    "hence , we can put them equal to zero from the beginning for simplicity .",
    "summarizing , two questions remain .",
    "firstly , we should prove that the value of @xmath55 will not influence the obtained value for @xmath186 .",
    "secondly , we should show that there exists a fixed point @xmath194 .",
    "we postpone the discussion concerning the second question to the next section , giving a positive answer to the first one . in order to do so ,",
    "let us reconsider the generating functional ( [ rge13 ] ) .",
    "we have the following identification , ignoring the overall normalization factors @xmath198\\exp is_\\sigma(j)=\\frac{1}{n}\\int      [ d\\varphi d\\sigma]\\exp i\\left[s(j)+\\int d^{4}x\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\zeta}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{g}-\\mathcal{o}_{\\mathrm{mag}}-\\zeta j\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are given respectively by eq.([d2 ] ) , and eq.([rge13bis ] ) . obviously , @xmath201\\exp \\left [ i\\int d^{4}x\\left ( -\\frac{1}{2\\zeta } \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma } { g}-\\mathcal{o}_{\\mathrm{mag}}-\\zeta j\\right ) ^{2}\\right ) \\right ] = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha } 1=0\\ ; , \\label{rge35}\\ ] ] so that @xmath202 which follows directly from @xmath203 we see that the first term in the right hand side of ( [ rge37 ] ) is an exact brst variation .",
    "as such , its vacuum expectation value vanishes .",
    "this is the usual argument to prove the gauge parameter independence in the brst framework @xcite .",
    "note that no local operator @xmath204 , with @xmath205 , exists .",
    "furthermore , extending the action of the brst transformation on the @xmath206-field by @xmath207 one can easily check that @xmath208 so that we have a brst invariant @xmath206-action .",
    "thus , when we consider the vacuum , corresponding to @xmath209 , only the brst exact term in eq.([rge36 ] ) survives .",
    "the effective action @xmath161 is related to @xmath168 through a legendre transformation @xmath210 the effective potential @xmath211 is then defined as @xmath212 let @xmath213 be the solution of @xmath214 from @xmath215 it follows that @xmath216 and hence , we derive from eqs.([rge40 ] ) and ( [ rge41 ] ) that @xmath217 thus , due to eq.([rge36 ] ) , @xmath218 we conclude that the vacuum energy @xmath186 should be independent from the gauge parameter @xmath55 .",
    "a completely analogous derivation was obtained in the case of the linear gauge @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of the previous argument , explicit results in that case showed that @xmath186 did depend on @xmath55 .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that this apparent disagreement was due to a mixing of different orders of perturbation theory .",
    "let us explain this with a simple example .",
    "let us first notice that a key argument in the previous analysis is that the source @xmath209 vanishes at the end of the calculations .",
    "in practice , @xmath209 is achieved by solving the gap equation ( [ rge42 ] ) . moreover , in a power series expansion in the coupling constant , the derivative of the effective potential with respect to @xmath206 will look like @xmath219 where we assume that we work up to order @xmath162 .",
    "the corresponding gap equation reads @xmath220 due to eqs.([rge41 ] ) and ( [ rge42bis ] ) , one also has @xmath221 imposing the gap equation ( [ rge47 ] ) leads to @xmath222 however , as it can be immediately checked from expression ( [ rge34 ] ) , there are several terms proportional to @xmath135 in the right - hand side of eq.([rge36 ] ) .",
    "for instance , one of them is given by @xmath223 .",
    "since @xmath224 we find @xmath225 squaring the gap equation ( [ rge47 ] ) , @xmath226 leads to @xmath227 we see that , if one consistently works to the first order , terms such as @xmath223 do not equal zero , although @xmath209 to that order .",
    "terms like those on the right - hand side of eq.([rge52 ] ) are cancelled by terms which are formally of higher order , requiring thus a mixing of different orders of perturbation theory .",
    "of course , this problem would not have occurred if we were be able to compute the effective potential up to infinite order , an evidently hopeless task .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite we succeeded in finding a suitable modification of the lco formalism in order to circumvent this problem and obtaining a well defined gauge independent vacuum energy @xmath186 , without the need of working at infinite order . instead of the action ( [ d2 ] ) ,",

    "one finds @xmath356",
    "the aim of this paper was to give analytic evidence , as expressed by eq.([ex22 ] ) , of the dynamical mass generation for off - diagonal gluons in yang - mills theory quantized in the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "this mass can be seen as support for the abelian dominance @xcite in that gauge .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the lattice version of the mag , were such a mass was also reported @xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal lattice gluon propagator could be fitted by @xmath357 , which is in correspondence with the tree level propagator we find .",
    "we have been able to prove the existence of the off - diagonal mass by investigating the condensation of a mass dimension two operator , namely @xmath15 .",
    "it was shown how a meaningful , renormalizable effective potential for this local composite operator can be constructed . by evaluating this potential explicitly at 1-loop order in the case of @xmath16 , the formation of the condensate is favoured since it lowers the vacuum energy . the latter does not depend on the choice of the gauge parameter @xmath55 , at least if one would work to infinite order in perturbation theory .",
    "we have explained in short the problem at finite order and discussed a way to overcome it .",
    "moreover , we have been able to interpolate between the landau gauge and the mag by unifying them in a larger class of renormalizable gauges .",
    "this observation was used to prove that the vacuum energy of yang - mills theory in the mag due to its mass dimension two condensate should be the same as the vacuum energy of yang - mills theory in the landau gauge with the much explored condensate @xmath9 .",
    "it is worth noticing that all the gauges , where a dimension two condensate provides a dynamical gluon mass parameter , such as the landau gauge @xcite , the curci - ferrari gauges @xcite , the linear gauges @xcite and the mag , can be connected to each other , either directly ( e.g. landau - mag ) or via the landau gauge ( e.g. mag and linear gauges ) .",
    "this also implies that , if @xmath358 in the landau gauge , the analogous condensates in the other gauges can not vanish either .",
    "then the question arises if this correspondence between different gauges could be stretched further to for instance the coulomb gauge , where the possibility of a condensate @xmath359 was already advocated some time ago in @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth remarking that this might be a more complicated task , since the coulomb gauge is not a covariant gauge fixing , and as such its analysis within the algebraic remormalization framework @xcite is not straightforward .    needless to say , the present work is far from being complete .",
    "first of all , an explicit calculation at two loop order and for general gauge group @xmath0 would be interesting .",
    "we also limited our computations to the tree level order . in principle",
    ", one should evaluate the off - diagonal gluon polarization in order to get further information on the structure of the propagator . a first step in this direction",
    "was taken in the case of the landau gauge in @xcite .",
    "it is unknown what will happen at higher orders in the mag , but it is likely that the external momentum @xmath360 will enter through loop corrections and influence the possible position of a pole in the propagator .",
    "the ghost condensation , that was first investigated in @xcite as a possible mechanism behind the off - diagonal mass , and later on was shown to be tachyonic @xcite , could enter this polarization too .",
    "this would require a more complete treatment of the ghost condensation in the mag , along the lines of @xcite , where these condensates were considered in more detail in the case of the curci - ferrari and landau gauge .",
    "another issue which deserves attention is the behaviour of the diagonal gluon . in @xcite",
    ", it was found that the diagonal gluon propagator also contain a mass parameters , with @xmath361 , while in @xcite the diagonal gluon was reported to behave like a light or massless particle . for completeness",
    ", we remind that these lattice simulations were both performed in the case of @xmath16 .",
    "we want to remark that a condensation of the composite diagonal operator @xmath362 can not occur within our approach , since this is forbidden by the diagonal local @xmath4 ward identity ( [ wi ] ) . in principle",
    ", one could add an extra source term like @xmath363 , but it does not seem possible to prove the renormalizability of this operator in the mag",
    ". this might be consistent with the result of @xcite , since the diagonal gluon propagator could _ not _ be fitted with a yukawa propagator @xmath357 , in contrast with the off - diagonal gluon propagator which could be fitted with @xmath357 .",
    "this could mean that the diagonal mass parameter is of a different nature compared to the off - diagonal one .",
    "a possible speculation is that it might have to do with gribov copies , since a fit @xmath364 did work for the diagonal propagator @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the mag condensate was also restricted to the purely perturbative level .",
    "one could imagine calculating in a certain non - trivial background .",
    "the vacuum energy calculated in one gauge should still be the same as the one calculated in the other gauge . in this context , and keeping in mind that monopole condensation is an essential ingredient of the dual superconductor picture , it might be worth noticing that the role of @xmath10 as an order parameter for monopole condensation was investigated in the landau gauge by the authors of @xcite , based on a similar observation in compact qed @xcite .",
    "we note that an off - diagonal gluon mass can serve as a starting point to derive low energy ( dual ) abelian models for yang - mills theories , see for example @xcite .",
    "let us conclude with a few considerations on the issues of the degrees of freedom and of the unitarity when the gluons attain a dynamical mass , as a consequence of a nonvanishing dimension two condensate @xmath365 .",
    "one possible way to look at the degrees of freedom associated to a given field is through its propagator . from the pole of the propagator one gets information about the mass of the field , while from its residue",
    "one learns about polarization states .",
    "however , the propagation of the field has to occur in some vacuum . in other words , the kind of vacuum in which the field propagates has to be supplemented . in our case",
    ", this task is achieved by the lcolagrangian , eq.([rge12 ] ) , i.e. @xmath366 which allows one to take into account the effects related to having a nontrivial vacuum corresponding to the nonvanishing dimension two condensate @xmath367 , as expressed by the identity @xmath368 that this is the preferred vacuum follows from the observation that the vacuum energy is lowered by the condensate @xmath174 .",
    "expanding thus around @xmath369 , a dynamical tree level mass @xmath370 for the off - diagonal gluons is generated in the gauge fixed lagrangian ( [ f1 ] ) , namely @xmath371 therefore , in the condensed vacuum , @xmath372 , the lagrangian ( [ f1 ] ) accounts for off - diagonal massive gluons .",
    "however , we emphasize that this dynamical mass parameter occurs as the result of a particular condensate .",
    "it is not a free parameter of the gauge fixed theory , its value being determined by a gap equation .",
    "concerning now the unitarity of the resulting theory , it should be remarked that , due to confinement , gluons and quarks are only to be called physical at a very high energy scale @xmath360 , where they behave almost freely and asymptotic states can be related to them , thanks to asymptotic freedom . at very high energies ,",
    "our dynamically massive action might be unitary : a renormalization group improvement could induce quantum corrections such that the mass parameter runs to zero for @xmath373",
    ". otherwise said , the corrections induced by this dynamical mass on the scattering amplitudes are expected to become less and less important as the energy of the process increases , so that the amplitudes of the massless case are in fact recovered .",
    "such a scenario would be analogous to the behaviour of the dynamical mass parameter discussed by cornwall in @xcite .",
    "for very high @xmath360 , one does indeed expect that perturbative yang - mills theory with massless gluons , having two physical degrees of freedom , describes the physical spectrum and that non - perturbative corrections are absent .    to decide if our resulting theory is unitary at smaller @xmath360 , one should know how to take into account the effects of confinement , which now can not be neglected",
    ". this would amount to knowing how to construct out of our lagrangian ( [ f1 ] ) the low energy spectrum of the theory , which is believed to be given by colorless bound states of gluons and quarks as , for instance , mesons , baryons and glueballs .",
    "this task is far beyond our capabilities . at intermediate @xmath360 ,",
    "what we can state is that this dynamical mass parametrizes the behaviour of the greens function of the gluon . as a result of quantum effects",
    ", i.e. the condensation of the mass dimension two operator , a pole appears in the off - diagonal gluon propagator at the tree level . including higher order effects",
    "will alter the propagators behaviour as well as the location of the pole at physical @xmath360 ( i.e. @xmath374 ) . in the case of the landau gauge",
    ", higher order calculations showed that the condensate remains stable , and hence a nonzero mass parameter will remain , see @xcite .",
    "this mass parameter will describe the behaviour of the greens function at euclidean @xmath360 .",
    "the presence of a mass parameter does however not necessarily entail the presence of a pole in the propagator at physical @xmath360 .",
    "using lattice simulations of the euclidean propagator , a mass parameter is found also by fitting at euclidean @xmath375 , but no pole and related massive particle is implied .",
    "analogously , one should not conclude from our calculations that the gluon is a massive , physical particle and that unitarity is violated .",
