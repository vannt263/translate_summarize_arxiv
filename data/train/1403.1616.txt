    "a natural question to ask here is : is @xmath9 properly included in a class of @xmath10-colorable graphs for a constant @xmath10 ?",
    "the following theorem shows that this is not the case .",
    "[ thm - r3-c - colorable ] the class @xmath9 is not included in a class of @xmath10-colorable graphs for some constant  @xmath10 .",
    "suppose that any graph in class @xmath9 is @xmath10-colorable for some constant @xmath10 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath198 since @xmath84 being @xmath26-colorable belongs to @xmath9 by theorem  [ thm : example ] .",
    "consider the triangular prism @xmath199 to the left in figure  [ modules - business ] , which is also @xmath26-colorable and , by theorem  [ pr3-thm ] , belongs to @xmath9 .",
    "replace the vertex @xmath25 in @xmath199 with a module @xmath200 , the complete graph on @xmath201 vertices ( see section  [ modules - subsec ] for the notion of a module ) as shown for the case of @xmath202 in figure  [ modules - business ] .",
    "denote the obtained graph by @xmath203 . since @xmath204 , by theorem  [ module - thm ] , @xmath205 .",
    "however , @xmath203 is not @xmath10-colorable since it contains a clique of size @xmath201 ( @xmath203 is @xmath206-colorable ) .",
    "we obtain a contradiction with our assumption .",
    "we note that an alternative way to obtain a contradiction in the proof of theorem  [ thm - r3-c - colorable ] is to consider the triangular prism @xmath199 ( which is in @xmath9 ) , the complete graph @xmath200 ( which is in @xmath15 ) , and either to connect these graphs by an edge , or glue these graphs in a vertex .",
    "then by theorem  [ connect - glue - thm ] , the obtained graph will be in @xmath9 , but it is @xmath206-colorable .    from considerations in this section",
    "it follows that , in particular , the classes @xmath9 and @xmath26-colorable graphs ( that are word - representable by theorem  [ obs:3col ] ) are not comparable in the sense that none of these classes is included in the other one . however , this section does not answer the following question .",
    "[ problem0 ] can each bipartite ( that is , @xmath11-colorable ) graph be @xmath26-word - represented ?",
    "namely , does each bipartite graph belong to the union of the sets @xmath207 ?",
    "we suspect the answer to the question in problem  [ problem0 ] to be negative . a good candidate for a counterexample should be the crown graph @xmath81 for @xmath208 ;",
    "see section  [ crown - graphs - sec ] and , in particular , problem  [ problem2 ] .",
    "the _ ladder graph _ @xmath209 with @xmath210 vertices and @xmath211 edges is presented in figure  [ ladder - pic ] .",
    "it follows from the proof of theorem  [ every - prism-3-repr ] in @xcite that @xmath209 is 3-word - representable . in the following theorem",
    ", we will show that @xmath209 is actually 2-word - representable for @xmath212 ( it is clearly @xmath25-word - representable for @xmath213 ) .",
    "we prove the statement by induction on @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath215 can be 2-represented by the word @xmath216 that has the factor @xmath217 .",
    "substituting the factor @xmath217 in @xmath36 by @xmath218 and reversing the entire word , we obtain the word @xmath219 that contains the factor @xmath220 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath37 represents @xmath221 since one only needs to check the alternation properties of the just added letters @xmath11 and  @xmath123 .    more generally , given a @xmath11-representation @xmath96 of @xmath222 containing the factor @xmath223",
    ", we substitute @xmath223 in @xmath96 by @xmath224 and reverse the entire word to obtain the word @xmath225 containing the factor @xmath226 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath225 represents @xmath227 since the only thing that needs to be checked is the right alternation properties of the just added letters @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "we are done .",
    "consider the cycle graph @xmath232 on five edges .",
    "@xmath232 is in @xmath16 ( it is 2-word - representable , but not 1-word - representable ) , but it is not a comparability graph and thus , by theorem  [ comparability - graphs ] , @xmath232 is not permutationally representable . on the other hand , the crown graphs @xmath233 and @xmath234 , being @xmath11-comparability graphs , belong to @xmath16 .",
    "also , @xmath85 , being a @xmath26-comparability graph , belongs to @xmath16 , since @xmath85 is the cycle graph @xmath235 .",
    "moreover , @xmath236 , being a 4-comparability graph , belongs to @xmath237 , which follows from the fact that @xmath236 is the prism @xmath238 ( the @xmath26-dimensional cube ) and theorem  [ prn - repr - num-3-thm ] can be applied .",
    "crown graphs , being bipartite graphs , and thus comparability graphs , provide an interesting case study of relations between @xmath7-comparability graphs and @xmath7-word - representable graphs . while each @xmath7-comparability graph is necessarily @xmath7-word - representable , in some cases such",
    "a graph is also @xmath59-word - representable , and , in fact , it is in @xmath239 in the known to us situations .",
    "thus , it seems like giving up permutational representability , we should be able to come up with a shorter representation of a given comparability graph . however , we do not know whether this is essentially always the case ( except for some particular cases like the graphs @xmath233 and @xmath234 ) .",
    "thus we state the following open problem .",
    "[ problem1 ] characterize @xmath7-comparability graphs that belong to @xmath240 for a fixed @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , characterize those @xmath7-comparability graphs that belong to @xmath239 . is the set of @xmath7-comparability graphs that belong to @xmath240 ( non-)empty for a fixed @xmath241 ?      [ problem2 ] characterize those @xmath81 that belong to @xmath240 for a fixed @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , characterize those @xmath81 that belong to @xmath239 . is the set of crown graphs @xmath81 that belong to @xmath240 ( non-)empty for a fixed @xmath241 ?    we suspect that each @xmath81 belongs to @xmath239 for @xmath242 .",
    "even if we would manage to prove this statement for a single @xmath208 , we would answer at once ( negatively ) the question in problem  [ problem0 ] .",
    "a step towards solving problem  [ problem2 ] can be the following observation : take the concatenation of the permutations representing @xmath81 discussed above and remove the leftmost @xmath243 letters @xmath244 and the rightmost @xmath243 letters @xmath245 .",
    "the remaining word will still represent @xmath81 , which is not difficult to see .",
    "one would then need to remove from the word two more letters , one copy of @xmath7 and one copy of @xmath109 , then possibly do some rearrangements of the remaining letters with a hope to obtain a word that would @xmath59-word - represent @xmath81 .",
    "for example , for @xmath246 , we begin with the word representing @xmath85 in table  [ ex - k - repr - hkk ] , and remove its first two , and its last two letters to obtain the following representation of @xmath85 : @xmath247 now , remove the leftmost 3 and the leftmost @xmath109 , make the last letter 1 to be the first letter 1 ( that is , make the cyclic one - position shift to the right ) , and , finally , replace the six rightmost letters in the obtained word by the word obtained by listing these letters in the reverse order to obtain a @xmath11-word - representation of @xmath85 ( this is the same representation as one would obtain for the cycle @xmath235 if to follow the strategy described in @xcite ) : @xmath248 .",
    "unfortunately , similar steps do not work for @xmath26-word - representing @xmath236 , and it is not so clear which copies of unwanted letters 4 and @xmath109 one should remove before conducting further rearrangements . in either case , even if one could demonstrate how to obtain a @xmath59-word - representation of @xmath81 for some @xmath208 , it is not so clear what generic argument would show that no @xmath249-word - representation exists , if this would be the case .",
