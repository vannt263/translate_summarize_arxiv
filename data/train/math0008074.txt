    "in 1996 , l.  h.  kauffman introduced the notion of a virtual knot , which is motivated by study of knots in a thickened surface and abstract gauss codes , cf .",
    "m.  goussarov , m.  polyak , and o.  viro @xcite proved that the natural map from the category of classical knots to the category of virtual knots is injective ; namely , if two classical knot diagrams are equivalent as virtual knots , then they are equivalent as classical knots . thus , virtual knot theory is a generalization of knot theory .",
    "it is also found in their paper @xcite that the notion of a virtual knot is helpful to study of finite type invariants .",
    "kauffman defined the jones polynomial of a virtual knot , which is also called the normalized bracket polynomial or the @xmath0-polynomial ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", according to @xcite , we call it the @xmath0-polynomial instead of the jones polynomial , since the definition is different from jones in @xcite .",
    "finite type invariants derived from the @xmath0-polynomials are studied in @xcite , and it is proved that a certain property of them ( corollary  14 of @xcite ) is hold in the category of virtual knots .",
    "the @xmath0-polynomial ( jones polynomial ) of a virtual link is quite different from @xmath0-polynomials of classical links . for a laurent polynomial @xmath0 on valuable @xmath1",
    ", we denote by @xmath2 the set of integers appearing as exponents of @xmath0 .",

    "however , this is not true for a virtual knot / link in general . in this paper",
    "we introduce the notion of _ checkerboard coloring _ of a virtual link diagram as a generalization of checkerboard coloring of a classical link diagram .",

    "then @xmath7 if @xmath6 is odd , and @xmath8 if @xmath6 is even .    by this corollary , we see that the virtual knot represented by figure  [ fig : example1 ] ( b ) is not equivalent to an alternating diagram .",
