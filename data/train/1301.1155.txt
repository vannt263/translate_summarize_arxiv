    "microtubules ( mts ) are long and stiff filamentous proteins , which assemble and disassemble from tubulin dimers and serve various functions in the cytoskeleton : mt stiffness plays an important role in cytoskeletal mechanics but they also serve as `` tracks '' for intracellular transport by molecular motors . finally , mts exhibit an unusual polymerization dynamics , which is essential for spatial organization and remodelling processes in the cytoskeleton @xcite .",
    "polymerizing mts can also generate pushing forces within the cell , because mts grow by tubulin insertion also in the presence of an obstacle which exerts an opposing force on tubulin dimers inserted at the growing mt tip .",
    "the opposing force is transmitted onto the mt , as has been demonstrated in single - mt buckling experiments in front of a solid wall @xcite .",
    "the force slows down further mt growth because monomer insertion against a force involves additional mechanical work .",
    "growth finally terminates under a maximal polymerization force , which is typically in the pn range @xcite .",
    "an important and unique feature of the mt polymerization dynamics is their so - called _ dynamic instability_. the dynamic instability gives rise to phases of fast shrinking , which stochastically interrupt polymerization phases @xcite .",
    "each phase of of fast shrinking is initiated by a catastrophe event and terminated by a rescue event .",
    "this complex dynamic behavior is central to rapid remodelling in the cytoskeleton but also affects the polymerization force .",
    "catastrophe and rescue events of mts are associated with guanosine triphosphate ( gtp ) hydrolysis within the mt @xcite .",
    "each tubulin dimer consists of an @xmath1- and @xmath2-tubulin and contains two gtp binding sites .",
    "tubulin dimers assemble into polar mts with a fast - growing plus end .",
    "gtp - tubulin dimers attach to the plus end with both binding sites containing gtp .",
    "the gtp in the @xmath1-tubulin is hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate ( gdp ) within the mt .",
    "this process leads to the formation of a gtp cap at the growing plus end , whereas the remaining mt consists of gdp - tubulin .",
    "the size of the gtp cap fluctuates in time and depends on the interplay of gtp - tubulin on - rate and hydrolysis rates within the mt .",
    "the gtp cap stabilizes the mt structure mechanically , and catastrophes are triggered by the loss of the gtp cap .",
    "the catastrophe rate therefore is related to the hydrolysis dynamics within the mt and given by the first passage rate to a state with vanishing gtp cap .",
    "there are different models describing this process @xcite , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_catmodels ] in more detail .",
    "the dynamic instability also limits the ability of mts to generate polymerization forces @xcite .    in a living cell ,",
    "mts often cooperate in order to generate higher forces .",
    "cooperative mt polymerization forces play an important role during mitosis in generating forces necessary for chromosome separation @xcite .",
    "a strong cooperativity in the dynamics of mts is also relevant in processes regulating the cell length , as has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for animal cells .",
    "mts also cooperate in the formation of cell protrusions , for example , in neuronal growth @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to develop models and a theoretical framework for the dynamics of mt ensembles under force , which can describe cooperative effects in the polymerization dynamics and quantify the cooperatively generated mt forces .    only recently , has it become possible to study force generation by mt ensembles _ in vitro _ using mt bundles growing against an elastic force , which was realized by an optical trap @xcite .",
    "experimental conditions were such that no rescue events occurred .",
    "the experiments showed _ collective catastrophes _ of the whole mt bundle : before a collective catastrophe , a large fraction of the mt ensemble is growing cooperatively against the elastic force ; growth often terminates in a catastrophe of the whole bundle where all pushing mts nearly simultaneously undergo a catastrophe . in the experiments in ref .",

    "@xcite , the experimentally observed collective catastrophes , and the linear @xmath0 dependence , could be reproduced in simulations , where polymerizing mts grow against an elastic force and interact by force sharing . a theory explaining the characteristic linear dependence of the maximal polymerization force on the number @xmath0 of mts is , however , lacking .",
    "the simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite included renucleation of mts after complete depolymerization , which led to oscillations in the growth dynamics of the mt ensemble .",
    "the simulations did not include rescue events , which can be relevant _ in vivo_.    in the present article , we will use a model for the collective dynamics of @xmath0 mts growing against an elastic barrier which is very similar to the model that has been used in the simulations in ref .",

    "@xcite , the ensemble of mts grow against an elastic force , which models the optical traps used in the experiments or the elastic cell cortex _ in vivo_. as in ref .",

    "@xcite , we will not consider renucleation of shrinking mts but include rescue events into the model , which are an essential part of mt dynamics , and study their influence on the cooperative mt dynamics .",

    "it allows us to extract the relevant control parameters , such as tubulin on - rate , rescue rate , and mt number , and to investigate their influence on dynamics and force generation .",
    "it is shown that , apart from collective catastrophes , also collective rescue events emerge if rescue events are taken into account in the single - mt dynamics .",
    "the resulting interplay between collective catastrophes and collective rescue events gives rise to an oscillatory growth dynamics of the entire mt ensemble .",
    "the dynamical mean - field theory successfully describes this oscillatory dynamics as a robust limit cycle .",
    "the dynamical mean field theory allows us to calculate the cooperative polymerization force generated by the mt ensemble and its dependence on the mt number @xmath0 , the stiffness of the barrier , and the mt growth parameters .",
    "furthermore , we use the dynamical mean field theory to investigate the robustness of our results against variations of the catastrophe model .",
    "this is an important question as at least two different catastrophe models have been put forward in the literature and have been shown to describe experimentally available data on single - mt catastrophe rates .",
    "robustness of our results show that details of the catastrophe models are not essential for force generation by ensembles of mts but only rather general features , such as the exponential increase of the catastrophe rate with force , are relevant .",
