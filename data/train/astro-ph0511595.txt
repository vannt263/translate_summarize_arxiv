    "the absolute value of neutrino masses are very difficult to measure experimentally . on the other hand , mass differences between the light neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath0 ,",
    "can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",

    "in the simplest case where neutrino masses are hierarchical these results suggest that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . if the hierarchy is inverted one instead finds @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . however , it is also possible that neutrino masses are degenerate , @xmath11 , in which case oscillation experiments are not useful for determining the absolute mass scale .",
    "experiments which rely on kinematical effects of the neutrino mass offer the strongest probe of this overall mass scale .",
    "tritium decay measurements have been able to put an upper limit on the electron neutrino mass of 2.3 ev ( 95% conf . )",
    "@xcite . however , cosmology at present yields an much stronger limit which is also based on the kinematics of neutrino mass .",
    "very interestingly there is also a claim of direct detection of neutrinoless double beta decay in the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite , corresponding to an effective neutrino mass in the @xmath12 ev range .",
    "if this result is confirmed then it shows that neutrino masses are almost degenerate and well within reach of cosmological detection in the near future .",
    "another important question which can be answered by cosmological observations is how large the total neutrino energy density is .",
    "apart from the standard model prediction of three light neutrinos , such energy density can be either in the form of additional , sterile neutrino degrees of freedom , or a non - zero neutrino chemical potential .",
    "in section 2 i review the present cosmological data which can be used for analysis of neutrino physics . in section 3",

    "the matrix elements for all relevant processes can for instance be found in ref .  @xcite . if maxwell - boltzmann statistics is used for all particles , and neutrinos are assumed to be in complete scattering equilbrium so that they can be represented by a single temperature , then the collision integral can be integrated to yield the average annihilation rate for a neutrino @xmath36 where @xmath37    this rate",
    "can then be compared with the hubble expansion rate @xmath38    to find the decoupling temperature from the criterion @xmath39 . from this one",
    "finds that @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 mev , when @xmath42 , as is the case in the standard model .",
    "this means that neutrinos decouple at a temperature which is significantly higher than the electron mass .",
    "when @xmath43 annihilation occurs around @xmath44 , the neutrino temperature is unaffected whereas the photon temperature is heated by a factor @xmath45 .",
    "the relation @xmath46 holds to a precision of roughly one percent .",
    "the main correction comes from a slight heating of neutrinos by @xmath43 annihilation , as well as finite temperature qed effects on the photon propagator @xcite .      shortly after neutrino decoupling",
    "the weak interactions which keep neutrons and protons in statistical equilibrium freeze out .",
    "again the criterion @xmath47 can be applied to find that @xmath48 mev @xcite .",
    "eventually , at a temperature of roughly 0.2 mev deuterium starts to form , and very quickly all free neutrons are processed into @xmath49he .",

    "one customary method for doing this has been to use measurements of primordial deuterium to infer @xmath55 and from that calculate a bound on @xmath53 .",
    "usually such bounds are expressed in terms of the equivalent number of neutrino species , @xmath56 , instead of @xmath53 .",
    "the exact value of the bound is quite uncertain because there are different and inconsistent measurements of the primordial helium abundance ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this issue ) .",
    "the most recent analyses are @xcite where a value of @xmath57 ( 95% c.l . )",
    "was found , @xcite which found @xmath58 , and @xcite which found that @xmath59 at 68% c.l .",
    "the difference in these results can be attributed to different assumptions about uncertainties in the primordial helium abundance .",
    "another interesting parameter which can be constrained by the same argument is the neutrino chemical potential , @xmath60 @xcite . at first sight",
    "this looks like it is completely equivalent to constraining @xmath61 .",
    "however , this is not true because a chemical potential for electron neutrinos directly influences the @xmath62 conversion rate .",
    "therefore the bound on @xmath63 from bbn alone is relatively stringent ( @xmath64 @xcite ) compared to that for muon and tau neutrinos ( @xmath65 @xcite ) .",
    "however , as will be seen in the next section , neutrino oscillations have the effect of almost equilibrating the neutrino chemical potentials prior to bbn , completely changing this conclusion .",
    "the bbn bound on the number of neutrino species presented in the previous section can be complemented by a similar bound from observations of the cmb and large scale structure .",
    "the cmb depends on @xmath61 mainly because of the early integrated sachs wolfe effect which increases fluctuation power at scales slightly larger than the first acoustic peak .",
    "the large scale structure spectrum depends on @xmath61 because the scale of matter - radiation equality is changed by varying @xmath61 .",
    "many recent papers have used cmb , lss , and sni - a data to calculate bounds bounds on @xmath61 @xcite , and some of the bounds are listed in table [ table : nnu ] .",
    "recent analyses combining bbn , cmb , and large scale structure data can be found in @xcite , and these results are also listed in table [ table : nnu ] .",
    "common for all the bounds is that @xmath66 is ruled out by both bbn and cmb / lss .",
    "this has the important consequence that the cosmological neutrino background has been positively detected , not only during the bbn epoch , but also much later , during structure formation .",
    "the most recent bound which uses the sni - a `` gold '' data set , as well as the new boomerang cmb data finds a limit of @xmath67 at 95% c.l .",
    "the bound from late - time observations is now as good as that from bbn , and the two derived value are mutually consistent given the systematic uncertainties in the primordial helium value .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the currently allowed region for @xmath55 and @xmath61 ( taken from @xcite ) .    .various recent limits on the effective number of neutrino species , as well as the data used . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : nnu ]      in the previous section the one - particle distribution function , @xmath68 , was used to describe neutrino evolution . however , for neutrinos the mass eigenstates are not equivalent to the flavour eigenstates because neutrinos are mixed .",
    "therefore the evolution of the neutrino ensemble is not in general described by the three scalar functions , @xmath69 , but rather by the evolution of the neutrino density matrix , @xmath70 , the diagonal elements of which correspond to @xmath69 .    for three - neutrino oscillations",
    "the formalism is quite complicated .",
    "however , the difference in @xmath71 and @xmath72 , as well as the fact that @xmath73 means that the problem effectively reduces to a @xmath74 oscillation problem in the standard model .",
    "a detailed account of the physics of neutrino oscillations in the early universe is outside the scope of the present paper , however an excellent and very thorough review can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite    without oscillations it is possible to compensate a very large chemical potential for muon and/or tau neutrinos with a small , negative electron neutrino chemical potential @xcite .",
    "however , since neutrinos are almost maximally mixed a chemical potential in one flavour can be shared with other flavours , and the end result is that during bbn all three flavours have almost equal chemical potential .",
    "this in turn means that the bound on @xmath75 applies to all species so that @xcite .",
    "@xmath76    for @xmath77 .    in models",
    "where sterile neutrinos are present even more remarkable oscillation phenomena can occur .",
    "however , i do not discuss this possibility further , except for the possibility of sterile neutrino warm dark matter , and instead refer to the review @xcite .",
    "in most models of inflation the universe enters the normal , radiation dominated epoch at a reheating temperature , @xmath78 , which is of order the electroweak scale or higher .",
    "however , in principle it is possible that this reheating temperature is much lower , of order mev .",
    "this possibility has been studied many times in the literature , and a very general bound of @xmath79 mev has been found @xcite    this very conservative bound comes from the fact that the light element abundances produced by big bang nucleosynthesis disagree with observations if the universe if matter dominated during bbn .",
    "however , a somewhat more stringent bound can be obtained by looking at neutrino thermalization during reheating .",
    "if a scalar particle is responsible for reheating then direct decay to neutrinos is suppressed because of the necessary helicity flip .",
    "this means that if the reheating temperature is too low neutrinos never thermalize .",
    "if this is the case then bbn predicts the wrong light element abundances .",
    "however , even if the heavy particle has a significant branching ratio into neutrinos there are problems with bbn .",
    "the reason is that neutrinos produced in decays are born with energies which are much higher than thermal .",
    "if the reheating temperature is too low then a population of high energy neutrinos will remain and also lead to conflict with observed light element abundances .",
    "a recent analysis showed that in general the reheating temperature can not be below roughly 4 mev @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are a source of dark matter in the present day universe simply because they contribute to @xmath80 .",
    "the present temperature of massless standard model neutrinos is @xmath81 ev , and any neutrino with @xmath82 behaves like a standard non - relativistic dark matter particle .",
    "the present contribution to the matter density of @xmath61 neutrino species with standard weak interactions is given by @xmath83 just from demanding that @xmath84 one finds the bound @xcite @xmath85      if neutrinos are the main source of dark matter , then they must also make up most of the galactic dark matter .",
    "however , neutrinos can only cluster in galaxies via energy loss due to gravitational relaxation since they do not suffer inelastic collisions . in distribution function language",
    "this corresponds to phase mixing of the distribution function @xcite . by using the theorem that the phase - mixed or coarse grained distribution function must explicitly take values smaller than the maximum of the original distribution function one arrives at the condition @xmath86 because of this upper bound",
    "it is impossible to squeeze neutrino dark matter beyond a certain limit @xcite . for the milky way",
    "this means that the neutrino mass must be larger than roughly 25 ev _ if _ neutrinos make up the dark matter . for irregular dwarf galaxies",
    "this limit increases to 100 - 300 ev @xcite , and means that standard model neutrinos can not make up a dominant fraction of the dark matter .",
    "this bound is generally known as the tremaine - gunn bound .",
    "note that this phase space argument is a purely classical argument , it is not related to the pauli blocking principle for fermions ( although , by using the pauli principle @xmath87 one would arrive at a similar , but slightly weaker limit for neutrinos ) .",
    "in fact the tremaine - gunn bound works even for bosons if applied in a statistical sense @xcite , because even though there is no upper bound on the fine grained distribution function , only a very small number of particles reside at low momenta ( unless there is a condensate ) .",
    "therefore , although the exact value of the limit is model dependent , limit applies to any species that was once in thermal equilibrium .",
    "a notable counterexample is non - thermal axion dark matter which is produced directly into a condensate .      a much stronger upper bound on the neutrino mass than the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mnu ] ) can be derived by noticing that the thermal history of neutrinos is very different from that of a wimp because the neutrino only becomes non - relativistic very late .    in an inhomogeneous universe",

    "therefore the _ relative _ suppression of power is proportional to the ratio of neutrino energy density to the overall matter density .",

    "this effect is shown for different neutrino masses in fig .",
    "[ fig : nutrans ] .",
    "the effect of massive neutrinos on structure formation only applies to the scales below the free - streaming length .",
    "for neutrinos with masses of several ev the free - streaming scale is smaller than the scales which can be probed using present cmb data and therefore the power spectrum suppression can be seen only in large scale structure data . on the other hand , neutrinos of sub - ev mass behave almost like a relativistic neutrino species for cmb considerations .",
    "the main effect of a small neutrino mass on the cmb is that it leads to an enhanced early isw effect .",
    "the reason is that the ratio of radiation to matter at recombination becomes larger because a sub - ev neutrino is still relativistic or semi - relativistic at recombination . with the wmap data",
    "alone it is very difficult to constrain the neutrino mass , and to achieve a constraint which is competitive with current experimental bounds it is necessary to include lss data from 2df or sdss . when this is done the bound becomes very strong , somewhere in the range of 1 - 1.5 ev for the sum of neutrino masses , depending on assumptions about priors @xcite    the bound can be strengthened even further by including data from the lyman-@xmath134 forest , measured at large redshifts .",

    "one caveat of most cosmological parameter analyses used to probe particle physics is that they are done with the minimal cosmological standard model . in principle",
    "there could easily be additional parameters which are important .",
    "one such example was described in @xcite , where it was shown that there is an almost perfect degeneracy between the neutrino mass and the equation of state of the dark energy , @xmath135 .",

    "the reason for the degeneracy is that when @xmath133 is increased , @xmath80 must be increased correspondingly in order to produce the same power spectrum .",
    "however , when @xmath137 an increasing @xmath80 quickly becomes incompatible with the supernova data .",

    "models with massive neutrinos have suppressed power at small scale , with suppression proportional to @xmath141 .",

    "while cdm is defined as consisting of non - interacting particles which have essentially no free - streaming on any astronomically relevant scale , and hdm is defined by consisting of particles which become non - relativistic around matter radiation equality or later , warm dark matter is an intermediate .",
    "one of the simplest production mechanisms for warm dark matter is active - sterile neutrino oscillations in the early universe @xcite .",
    "one possible benefit of warm dark matter is that it does have some free - streaming so that structure formation is suppressed on very small scales .",
    "this has been proposed as an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between observations of galaxies and numerical cdm structure formation simulations . in general simulations",

    "neither of these characteristics are seen in observations and the explanation for this discrepancy remains an open question . if dark matter is warm instead of cold , with a free - streaming scale comparable to the size of a typical galaxy subhalo then the amount of substructure is suppressed , and possibly the central density profile is also flattened @xcite . in both cases the mass of the dark matter particle should be around 1 kev @xcite , assuming that it is thermally produced in the early universe .    on the other hand , from measurements of the lyman-@xmath134 forest flux power spectrum it has been possible to reconstruct the matter power spectrum on relatively small scales at high redshift .",
    "this spectrum does not show any evidence for suppression at sub - galaxy scales and has been used to put a lower bound on the mass of warm dark matter particles of roughly 500 ev @xcite .",
    "an even more severe problem lies in the fact that star formation occurs relatively late in warm dark matter models because small scale structure is suppressed",
    ". this may be in conflict with the low-@xmath146 cmb temperature - polarization cross correlation measurement by wmap which indicates very early reionization and therefore also early star formation .",
    "one recent investigation of this found warm dark matter to be inconsistent with wmap for masses as high as 10 kev @xcite .",
    "the case for warm dark matter therefore seems quite marginal , although at present it is not definitively ruled out by any observations .",
    "here i have reviewed some of the basics of neutrino cosmology with particular emphasis on the role that neutrinos play in cosmological structure formation .",
    "exactly because neutrinos play such a crucial role in cosmology it is possible to use cosmological observations to probe fundamental properties of neutrinos which are not easily accessible in lab experiments .",
    "particularly the measurement of absolute neutrino masses from cmb and large scale structure data has received significant attention over the past few years .",
    "another cornerstone of neutrino cosmology is the measurement of the total energy density in non - electromagnetically interacting particles . for many years",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis was the only probe of relativistic energy density , but with the advent of precision cmb and lss data it has been possible to complement the bbn measurement . at present the cosmic neutrino background is seen in both bbn , cmb and lss data at high significance .",
    "in the coming years the steady stream of new observational data will continue , and the cosmological bounds on neutrino will improve accordingly .",
    "for instance , it has been estimated that with data from the upcoming planck satellite it could be possible to measure neutrino masses as low as 0.1 ev , and possibly even lower than that if data from future cluster surveys is used .",
