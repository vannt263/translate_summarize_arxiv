    "before we can address these issues we need to introduce basic concepts in quantum mechanics and quantum information .",
    "we will also mention how ideas in the foundations of quantum mechanics have inspired new applications of quantum theory , with a particular focus on the bell inequality @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce quantum mechanics and discuss the concept of entanglement @xcite .",
    "einstein , podolsky and rosen used entanglement to argue that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory @xcite .",

    "we finish by discussing possible connections between bell inequalities and measurement - based quantum computing @xcite ; the latter utilises entangled states to perform computational tasks .",
    "all of the work in this chapter is introductory and does not consist of new results produced by the author of this thesis .      in this section ,",
    "we give a brief overview of the postulates of quantum mechanics .",
    "we also look at one of the consequences of these postulates : entanglement .",
    "there are very many clear and excellent pedagogical introductions to the quantum formalism ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we base our introduction on that of nielsen and chuang @xcite .",
    "the more relevant aspects of quantum theory will be emphasized , especially with regards to measurements .",
    "quantum mechanics is a mathematical framework for making predictions of outcomes of experiments .",
    "the problem of how this framework relates to a picture of physical reality is still open .",
    "an interesting research direction is to recover the quantum formalism from a set of axioms rooted in less mathematical , or more physical principles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this subject will not be addressed in this thesis as it would be too much of a diversion from our discussion .",
    "although , the issue of realism in a limited form will be encountered in section [ sec21 ] .      in this subsection , we assume familiarity with linear algebra , complex vector spaces and dirac notation ( @xcite is an excellent reference for these subjects ) .",
    "physical systems described by quantum mechanics are associated with a complex inner product vector space , or hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "this idea can be formalised in the following postulate taken verbatim from @xcite .",
    "* postulate 1 * @xcite .",
    "_ associated to any isolated physical system is a complex vector space with inner product ( that is , a hilbert space ) known as the state space of the system .",
    "the system is completely described by its state vector , which is a unit vector in the system s state space .",
    "_    a unit vector @xmath1 in this hilbert space @xmath0 must satisfy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dual vector to @xmath1 in the dual hilbert space @xmath4 . for two - dimensional hilbert spaces ,",
    "all unit vectors are called `` qubits '' ( quantum bits ) and can be written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are complex numbers satisfying @xmath8 . by convention",
    "we choose the basis states in a @xmath9-dimensional hilbert space @xmath0 ( where @xmath9 is finite ) to be @xmath10 where @xmath11 can be described in terms of the cyclic group @xmath12 . ] .",
    "more generally , quantum states can be associated with `` density matrices '' @xmath13 , or an element of the space @xmath14 of linear operators on @xmath0 .",
    "we may need to consider density matrices for physical systems that are not isolated or when an experimenter is not sure which state @xmath1 a system is in ; they assign probabilities to the possibilities .",
    "these density matrices represent statistical ensembles of the unit vectors described by postulate 1 .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath1 are associated with `` pure states '' that are the density matrices @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath13 is a statistical ensemble of pure states @xmath16 then it can be represented as @xmath17 where @xmath18 labels all possible pure states in an ensemble .",
    "the probabilities @xmath19 are associated with each pure state @xmath16 where @xmath20 and all @xmath21 .    for density matrices ,",
    "the inner product is generalised to the operator trace @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , due to the cyclicity of trace .",
    "this is one of the conditions that a density matrix must satisfy along with the positivity condition @xmath24 .",
    "this second condition is satisfied for any arbitrary state @xmath25 as @xmath26 due to @xmath27 .",
    "the second postulate describes how quantum states can be transformed over time . again this and",
    "all postulates are reproduced verbatim from @xcite .",
    "* postulate 2 * @xcite . _ the evolution of a closed system is described by a unitary transformation .",
    "that is , the state _",
    "@xmath1 _ of the system at time _",
    "@xmath28 _ is related to the state _",
    "@xmath29 _ of the system at time _",
    "@xmath30 _ by a unitary operator _",
    "@xmath31 _ which depends only on the times _ @xmath28 _ and _ @xmath30 , @xmath32    we immediately see that a unitary operator preserves normalisation of a state as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the adjoint of @xmath31 so that @xmath35 , the identity matrix .",
    "unitary operators can also be applied to a density matrix as @xmath36 for open systems ( i.e. systems that are not closed ) we can generalise the unitary operator to a linear operator that must be completely positive and not increase the trace of @xmath13 .",
    "the next postulate of quantum mechanics relates to measurements which are a form of completely positive and non - trace - increasing linear operator .    *",
    "postulate 3 * @xcite .",
    "_ quantum measurements are described by the collection _",
    "@xmath37 _ of measurement operators .",
    "these are operators acting on the state space of the system being measured .",

    "@xmath1 _ immediately before the measurement then the probability that result @xmath38 occurs is given by _",
    "@xmath39 _ and the state of the system after the measurement is _",
    "@xmath40 _ the measurement operators satisfy the completeness equation , _",
    "@xmath41 again , the above postulate can be extended to density matrices @xmath13 where @xmath42 becomes @xmath43 and the state of the system after measurement is now @xmath44 therefore measurement operators @xmath45 act on density matrices in an analogous fashion to unitary operators . in calculating the probabilities of particular outcomes and satisfying the completeness relation , @xmath46 and @xmath45 always appear together . for probabilities of measurement outcomes",
    "we rewrite @xmath47 as an operator @xmath48 associated with a measurement outcome @xmath38 .",
    "the operator @xmath48 is called an `` element '' of a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) and is a positive operator , @xmath49 is a probability by definition , so @xmath48 is a positive operator . ]",
    "such that @xmath50 with probabilities @xmath51 .",
    "the set of operators @xmath52 is then a povm .",
    "a special case of all possible measurements is the von neumann projective measurement ( pvm ) .",
    "this is the set @xmath53 where each element @xmath54 is a projector associated with a measurement outcome @xmath38 .",
    "these projectors satisfy an orthogonality constraint @xmath55 and for an arbitrary pure state @xmath1 , the state after a pvm is @xmath56 .",
    "then , to satisfy the orthogonality constraint , we need @xmath57 orthogonal vectors @xmath58 to describe the projectors @xmath59 , where @xmath57 is the number of possible outcomes @xmath38 of a measurement .",
    "a pvm can be associated with an `` observable '' which matches each projector @xmath54 of a pvm with a real eigenvalue @xmath60 .",
    "this observable @xmath61 can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath60 is an observed outcome .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath60 corresponds to a system being projected into the eigenstate @xmath63 associated with @xmath54 . ] .",
    "for example , for a two - dimensional hilbert space , we can have observables with eigenvalues @xmath64 associated with two - dimensional vectors @xmath63 where @xmath38 takes two possible values .",
    "there is a beautiful result due to naimark that shows that any povm on a quantum state can be associated with a pvm @xcite .",
    "that is , every povm acting on a hilbert space @xmath0 can be implemented with a pvm on a larger hilbert space @xmath65 .",
    "we can obtain some auxiliary ( often referred to as an ancilla ) system and take the composite of this system and our original hilbert space @xmath0 and perform a pvm on this new space . in order to consider composite systems we need to introduce the next postulate .",
    "* postulate 4 * @xcite . _",
    "the state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component physical systems .",
    "moreover , if we have systems numbered @xmath66 through @xmath67 , and system number @xmath68 is prepared in the state @xmath69 , then the joint state of the total system is @xmath70 .",
    "_    we can replace pure states @xmath69 in this postulate with density matrices @xmath71 .",
    "composite systems can be represented by density matrices as linear operators on a tensor product hilbert space , i.e. @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the hilbert space of each @xmath68th system . while in the postulate",
    ", we mention one pure state , @xmath74 , in particular , this is not the most general pure state in a composite hilbert space @xmath75 .",
    "the state @xmath76 is a `` product state '' , but pure states that can not be expressed in this form are said to be `` entangled '' .",
    "this property will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we have given a brief overview of the mathematical construction of quantum mechanics .",
    "in this thesis , we will be utilising the definition of a measurement and the description of composite systems .",
    "if a composite system consists of two space - like separated systems @xmath77 and @xmath78 , then experimenters in each of these space - like separated systems can perform measurements on each of their respective subsystems .",
    "this way measurements can be written as a tensor product of these localised measurements , i.e. @xmath79 where @xmath80 , a linear operator on @xmath73 .",
    "assume that one can prepare all possible states ( by whatever means ) on the composite system , i.e. @xmath81 . if the measurements are performed on _ entangled _ states then the statistics produced by this total system do not always factorise , i.e. @xmath82 as @xmath13 is not necessarily equal to @xmath83 where @xmath84 corresponds to a pure state of the @xmath68th system in the @xmath18th term of the decomposition of @xmath13 .",
    "this inability for the statistics of space - like separated measurements to be factorised will be central to the discussion of quantum correlations in this thesis .",
    "entanglement is central to this subject . in the next subsection",
    "we will briefly discuss entanglement and how it can be quantified .",
    "schrdinger first introduced the term `` entanglement '' @xcite .",
    "this concept has become formalised for all possible density matrices @xmath13 .",
    "first we describe systems in a bipartite scenario , that is where the hilbert space of the system in question is the tensor product of two hilbert spaces .",
    "an entangled state represented by a density matrix @xmath13 * can not * be expressed as @xmath85 the pure state @xmath86 is the @xmath18th party s state for the @xmath68th pure state in the probabilistic ensemble of @xmath13 .",
    "there may be multiple , even infinite possible decompositions of @xmath13 into a convex combination of pure states @xmath87 .",
    "for example , the density matrix @xmath88 in a composite hilbert space of two , two - dimensional hilbert spaces can be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 becomes @xmath92 . ] .",
    "this multiplicity of decomposition makes it difficult to ascertain whether an arbitrary density matrix is entangled or otherwise .",
    "if a density matrix is a bipartite pure state , then there is a definite method to detect whether this state is entangled or not @xcite .",
    "this method of detection also can quantify the _ amount of entanglement_. for mixed states , this detection is a hard problem to compute @xcite .",
    "the method of detecting entanglement for bipartite pure states involves finding the `` entropy of entanglement '' @xcite . to calculate this quantity ,",
    "first one needs to find the reduced density matrix of @xmath93 and @xmath94 corresponding to party @xmath66 and @xmath95 .",
    "the reduced density matrix is calculated from the partial trace of @xmath13 , where we only take a trace over one party s system instead of the whole composite system .",
    "the partial trace of @xmath13 over system @xmath66 of two systems is written as @xmath96 and is calculated as @xmath97 where @xmath98 are basis states on system @xmath66 . without loss of generality , we assume that all subsystems have the same dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we then calculate the von neumann entropy @xmath99 @xcite of this reduced density matrix @xmath93 : @xmath100 if @xmath101 , then the reduced state @xmath93 is a pure state and so @xmath102 with both @xmath103 being pure states .",
    "importantly if @xmath104 then the pure state @xmath13 is entangled . for @xmath105 , then @xmath106 .",
    "the state @xmath13 that results in @xmath105 is the `` maximally entangled state '' of two qubits , as it gives the maximum value of @xmath99 for two qubits .",
    "the maximally entangled state @xmath107 of two @xmath9-dimensional systems can be written as @xmath108 if we take the partial trace over system @xmath66 , then @xmath109 in the case of two qubits we retrieve the value of entropy mentioned above , but in general , for these states @xmath110 .",
    "we have only discussed the bipartite case . in this thesis",
    ", we will also be interested in multipartite quantum systems .",
    "the definition of an entangled multipartite state is now where an entangled state can not be written as but with @xmath87 now replaced with @xmath111 .",
    "entanglement of multipartite systems is relatively less well - studied but there do exist measures of entanglement in this scenario @xcite .",
    "there is also not one particular maximally entangled state for the multipartite setting like there is for the bipartite setting .",
    "so far entanglement has been discussed as a mathematical construct and we have not discussed its physical consequences . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the impact of entanglement upon the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "that is , it causes a tension between quantum physics and a classical physics view of the world @xcite .",
    "if quantum mechanics describes what is actually happening in the world then we need to accept some behaviour that is potentially incompatible with everyday intuition .",
    "we will make these issues more rigorous in the next section .",
    "albert einstein played a crucial role in the development of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "however , upon being developed formally , he was famously dissatisfied with it .",
    "at its core , quantum mechanics predicts probabilities , and does not always make deterministic predictions does not throw dice . ''",
    "it could be argued that this probabilistic feature convinced einstein that quantum mechanics was a statistical theory akin to classical statistical , or liouvillian mechanics @xcite . in liouvillian mechanics objects have defined positions and momentum , but we may not have complete knowledge of these properties .",
    "therefore , a probability distribution is assigned over a space of potential properties of a system .",
    "the state @xmath1 could also resemble a probability distribution over some underlying reality describing a system . for more discussion of einstein s potential view of quantum physics , see work by harrigan and spekkens @xcite .",
    "a particular focus for einstein s criticism of quantum mechanics became the issue of `` locality '' .",
    "locality has many different guises but we heuristically use it here in the sense that events in space - time can only `` affect '' each other if they are within each other s light - cone .",
    "it has been suggested by bacciagaluppi and valentini that einstein had an argument against quantum theory based on a violation of locality at the 1927 solvay conference @xcite .",
    "this discussion is beyond the scope of this thesis but we only mention it as a prelude to the argument presented by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite , often called the `` epr paradox '' .      in the original epr paper , they argued that if one can predict a physical property , or quantity , with certainty then we associate that quantity with an `` element of reality '' @xcite . if by the definition of epr , a theory is `` complete '' then the properties that are found with certainty must be incorporated into the theory describing the system .",
    "take two observables @xmath112 and @xmath113 that do not commute , i.e. @xmath114\\neq 0 $ ] , and a state @xmath1 being an eigenstate of @xmath112 ( with eigenvalue @xmath115 ) .",
    "if we make the constraint that the two observables do not share eigenstates nor are any of the eigenstates of one observable orthogonal to eigenstates of the other .",
    "we can predict the outcome @xmath115 of observable @xmath112 with certainty , but can not predict the outcome of @xmath113 with certainty on @xmath1 , we obtain @xmath115 so that the projection @xmath116 has been performed on @xmath1 , giving the probability @xmath117 .",
    "however , @xmath113 consists of projectors @xmath118 where @xmath119 so for @xmath113 @xmath120 . ] .",
    "this means that we can only associate the observable @xmath112 with an element of reality but not both observables .",
    "the following contradiction emerges if one asserts that elements of reality can only be associated with commuting observables .",
    "we follow bohm s version of the epr argument @xcite .",
    "imagine that two parties share the entangled state ( that is equivalent to the maximally entangled state such that @xmath121 to both qubits . ] ) : @xmath122 such that one party has access to one of the two - dimensional subsystems , or qubit , and the other party has access to the other qubit .",
    "we have put no constraint on the distance between the two parties , and in fact we make them space - like separated .",
    "the first party makes measurements of the observables @xmath123 or @xmath124 . each observable",
    "is associated with outcomes , or eigenvalues @xmath125 and projectors @xmath54 associated with this eigenvalue . according to epr",
    "because the parties are space - like separated they can no longer `` interact '' , and regardless of the observable performed by the first party , we must assign the same elements of reality to the second party @xcite .",
    "if party @xmath66 measures @xmath126 and gets @xmath127 or @xmath128 then the second party s state will be @xmath129 or @xmath130 respectively with certainty ( upto a global phase ) .",
    "since we can predict the second party s state with certainty we must assign this property with an element of reality .",
    "if , on the other hand , party @xmath66 measures @xmath131 then for outcomes @xmath127 or @xmath128 the second party s state will be @xmath132 or @xmath133 respectively ( upto a global phase ) . again , we can assign an element of reality since after the measurement , the first party knows the second party s state with certainty .    to summarise ,",
    "if party @xmath66 measures @xmath126 , then we can assign an element of reality with the second party s observable @xmath126 .",
    "when party @xmath66 measures @xmath131 , we assign an element of reality with the second party s observable @xmath131 .",
    "since the measurements performed by party @xmath66 are space - like separated from party @xmath95 , the elements of reality for party @xmath95 should not be affected by the first party s measurements .",
    "this is the locality argument in the epr paradox .",
    "however , @xmath126 and @xmath131 do not commute , so we can not assign an element of reality to each observable arriving at a contradiction .",
    "epr reasoned that this contradiction means that quantum mechanics does not result in a complete picture of reality @xcite .",
    "john bell formalised the language of the epr paradox away from the discussion of `` incompleteness '' and `` elements of reality '' into more mathematically rigorous concepts @xcite .",
    "he showed that the assumption upon which the epr paradox is based is that all physical systems obey `` local realism '' @xcite .",
    "local realism combines two separate assumptions invoking locality and realism and can be seen to limit the statistics of space - like separated measurements . in the following subsection",
    "we will briefly review local realism and show that it puts constraints on these statistics .",
    "we will describe local realism mathematically in section [ sec21 ] of the next chapter but for now , we review the work of clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) @xcite .",
    "the seminal work of bell @xcite led to the formulation of the bell inequality .",
    "this work was developed by chsh into a mathematical expression that can be experimentally testable : the chsh inequality .",
    "we now describe the bell - chsh scenario , or `` test '' @xcite .",
    "there are two parties and each party chooses between two measurements .",
    "the choice of measurement is a completely random , free choice of the parties .",
    "this is a key assumption in the construction of bell inequalities @xcite ( for consequences of dropping this assumption see @xcite ) .",
    "each measurement has two possible outcomes @xmath125 .",
    "the measurements that the @xmath18th party chooses from are @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "these measurements can be described by an arbitrary theory and not just quantum theory .",
    "the statistics in this experiment that will be of interest to us are the correlations of the form @xmath136 the expectation values of the joint outcome of both parties measurements for choices @xmath137 , @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the probability of getting the joint measurement outcome @xmath125 .",
    "there is actually a class of chsh inequalities for this scenario @xcite , but we just pick out one particular expression @xmath140 where the upper bound of @xmath95 is satisfied for all physical systems that satisfy local realism @xcite .",
    "local realism means outcomes of @xmath141 are only dependent on some set of objective properties of each party s system . secondly , these properties ( which can be seen as elements of reality ) are localised to each space - like separated region .",
    "whilst they may have been shared properties when parties were not separated in the past , they are not affected by anything outside of their region .",
    "a locally realistic property for measurement @xmath142 is then @xmath143 , so we can write the left - hand - side of as @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a probability distribution over all possible assignments of @xmath146 to measurements such that @xmath147 and @xmath148 . by convexity",
    "we can upper bound the right - hand - side of by just considering the maximum value of @xmath149 .",
    "if @xmath150 is non - zero then @xmath151 will be zero , resulting in @xmath152 this expression then gives exactly the same right - hand - side of .",
    "this result is interesting as we can derive a consequence of a theory with very few prior assumptions .",

    "also we will comment on the hardness of finding the bell inequalities that define the polytope of locally realistic correlations .",
    "the convex geometric approach has also been extended to the study of correlations that satisfy only a form of locality : space - like separated measurements that do not allow instantaneous communication @xcite .",
    "these issues will be discussed in section [ sec23 ] .",
    "testing whether quantum mechanics violates a bell inequality in the laboratory is a difficult task .",
    "firstly , measurements have to be space - like separated but transporting fragile quantum states over large distances can be hard . states may interact with the environment and become mixed states that are no longer entangled . secondly , apparatus in the lab is not perfect and detectors may not always perfectly detect a measurement outcome .",
    "these difficulties can lead to `` loopholes '' ( as we shall discuss in section [ sec41 ] of chapter [ chap4 ] ) whereby locally realistic theories are no longer constrained by the bell inequality being tested @xcite .",
    "if we do not have space - like separated measurements then the local aspect of locally realistic theories is not constrained and we have the `` locality loophole '' . for imperfect detection , the associated `` detection loophole '' is more subtle as it allows the possibility that the objective properties of a system can describe the statistics of detection @xcite . if we make the extra assumption that properties of the system we are observing are independent of the detection system , often called the `` fair - sampling assumption '' @xcite , then violations of a bell inequality have been observed in photonic systems @xcite . without this extra assumption ,",
    "then ion - based systems have got around the detection loophole but suffer from the locality loophole @xcite . at the time of writing this thesis , completely loophole - free bell inequality violations have not been observed .",

    "bell s theorem can be proven using the now - famous bell inequality .",
    "did we need to construct this expression",
    "? there have been several arguments which have shown that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local realism but without use of a bell inequality . for example , in 1983 , heywood and redhead @xcite developed a proof that local realism can not be compatible with the statistics of two space - like separated , yet entangled spin-@xmath66 systems .",
    "this proof relied on an argument of determinism , in the spirit of the original epr argument @xcite . later in 1989 , greenberger , horne , and zeilinger ( ghz ) developed a proof of bell s theorem without inequalities for three space - like separated parties @xcite .",
    "the ghz argument has subsequently been developed by mermin @xcite .",
    "another notable example of bell s theorem without the inequality is `` hardy s paradox '' which can be seen as a `` possibilistic '' proof , i.e. some things are possible in quantum mechanics that are not possible with locally realistic theories @xcite .",
    "we now present the ghz argument , or `` ghz paradox '' to which it is often referred , as a simple and beautiful proof of bell s theorem .",
    "we have three , space - like separated parties who ( like in the chsh construction ) each have a completely free choice of measurement from a set of two measurements .",
    "we label the two measurements for the @xmath18th site @xmath134 and @xmath135 and each measurement takes one of two possible outcomes @xmath125 . as with the chsh construction , each outcome is then a result of some objective property of each party s local system ( which may have been shared in the past ) .",
    "therefore , each measurement @xmath141 again is assigned the value @xmath164 .",

    "@xmath175 satisfy correlations in , , and .",
    "however , @xmath176 thus contradicting .",
    "these quantum correlations have deterministically shown that local realism is inconsistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "mermin showed that we can still construct a bell inequality from the correlations of the ghz argument @xcite .",
    "we construct the following inequality @xmath177 which the correlations in , , and satisfy .",
    "mermin showed that this inequality is satisfied for all locally realistic theories @xcite , but the quantum mechanical correlations described above give a value of @xmath178 for the left - hand - side of .",
    "we will show in section [ sec14 ] that the ghz - mermin argument against local realism in quantum physics will be relevant to discussion about quantum information .",
    "the chsh inequality and the ghz argument are ways of putting constraints on what is possible in a classical , or more generally , a locally realistic theory .",
    "the fact that quantum mechanics predicts contradictions to both constraints gives a remarkable departure from a classical view of the world .",
    "it indicates that when we are utilising the quantum mechanical formalism we can produce non - classical phenomena .",
    "one of the most enticing prospects for quantum mechanics is to use non - classical behaviour to perform some useful task that we could not achieve with classical resources .",

    "holevo s theorem is one of the most significant results in information theory applied to quantum systems and quantum `` channels '' . ] .",
    "the idea of a `` quantum computer '' , or some quantum system capable of performing computations was first suggested by richard feynman in 1982 @xcite ; the work of david deutsch later formalised this concept @xcite .",
    "wootters and zurek showed that unknown quantum information can not be copied , called the `` no - cloning '' theorem @xcite . in the light of all of this work ,",
    "we begin our discussion in the next subsection in 1984 , with the seminal work by bennett and brassard ( bb ) on quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "this work by bb brought together the ideas of the no - cloning theorem and conjugate cloning in a simple yet powerful way .",
    "two parties , referred to as alice and bob want to communicate to each other without fear of eavesdroppers intercepting their messages .",
    "alice encodes her message into another message or `` ciphertext '' with a `` key '' that bob knows but no - one else does .",
    "bob can use the `` key '' to unlock alice s message from the ciphertext .",
    "an eavesdropper can try and guess or calculate the key , but if it is random and alice applies the `` one - time pad '' , then a message can be made perfectly secure as defined by shannon @xcite .",
    "the one - time pad consists of one bit of a message @xmath179 being added ( modulo @xmath95 ) to a random bit @xmath180 giving @xmath181 , i.e. @xmath182 where @xmath183 represents modulo @xmath95 addition .",

    "shannon showed that this makes the ciphertext secure if an eavesdropper can not obtain all values of @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "how does alice share the key consisting of the values of @xmath185 to bob ?",
    "since their goal was to communicate securely in the first place , they must find a secure way so that each party can communicate the random key . in 1984",
    ", bb showed that the combination of publicly communicating quantum states @xmath1 from alice to bob and publicly communicating classical information about these states between alice and bob , secure values of @xmath185 can be generated @xcite .",
    "an eavesdropper can not perfectly copy the state that is publicly communicated by the no - cloning theorem , so must make a measurement to learn @xmath1 .",
    "the security is partly based on the fact that when an eavesdropper makes a measurement on the quantum state that is sent from alice to bob , they project the state into another state which may be different from @xmath1 .",
    "if the eavesdropper projects into a different state , alice and bob can compare measurement outcomes on the state to detect this .",
    "if alice and bob proceed with a particular protocol , with public quantum and classical communication , they can generate a secure random key .",
    "we then describe this as a method of `` quantum key distribution '' ( qkd ) .    in 1991 , artur ekert developed another method of qkd that utilised entanglement @xcite .",
    "this result alongside the discovery of `` quantum teleportation '' @xcite based upon sharing entanglement and classical communication led , in earnest , to entanglement being investigated as a resource for quantum information processing .",
    "ekert based his protocol on a modified version of the chsh bell inequality test where alice and bob each receive one - half of the bipartite entangled state @xmath154 .",
    "the intuition behind the protocol is that a key is revealed by the act of space - like separated measurements on this entangled state ; if a key existed before measurement it would be an `` element of reality '' and so incompatible with an entangled state .    for a given choice of measurements as discussed in the epr paradox , outcomes are perfectly correlated generating a shared random bit .",
    "alice and bob randomly choose measurements and announce the choice after receiving measurement outcomes .",
    "an eavesdropper can intercept the quantum state before it reaches either alice or bob and make a measurement , but this interception leaves the state in a separable state .",
    "they use the chsh inequality to confirm that the state is entangled when they make measurements on it .",
    "therefore , the protocol requires that the state is entangled and the chsh inequality just confirms this , the security of the original 1991 protocol does not hinge directly on the incompatibility with local realism .",
    "remarkably , in the spirit of ekert s intuition , barrett , hardy and kent designed a protocol whereby security was guaranteed by a bell inequality violation @xcite .",

    "we say a convex polytope is bounded if it can be contained in a ball of finite radius and unbounded otherwise .",
    "we impose the extra constraints that there are a finite number of inequalities that form a bounded polytope @xcite .",
    "the linear inequalities in the above definition are `` facet - defining '' which we define formally later on but can be informally seen as the boundary of the convex polytope @xmath260 .",
    "if we return to the example of @xmath259 as the space of all possible conditional probabilities @xmath266 then the linear inequalities defining @xmath259 are the positivity and normalisation constraints .",
    "as mentioned , dual to the half - space representation , the vertex representation of a convex polytope describes the polytope in terms of all points , or vectors in the polytope :    [ defn212 ] _",
    "( vertex representation ) _ : * convex polytope * @xmath260 in a real space @xmath261 of dimension @xmath209 is the convex hull of @xmath267 extreme points , or vectors @xmath268 for @xmath269 .",
    "the convex polytope @xmath260 then is the set of vectors that can be written as a convex combination of @xmath267 vectors in the @xmath209-dimensional real space .",
    "for example , the polytope @xmath259 can then be written in terms of the convex combination of @xmath267 vectors @xmath251 which we call @xmath270 for @xmath269 with probability distribution @xmath271 over each @xmath270 .",
    "these vectors have the elements @xmath270 that are the _ deterministic _ probabilities @xmath272 .",
    "for these deterministic probabilities we associate values @xmath273 with each map @xmath274 .",
    "this way the probabilities can be written as @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the image of @xmath227 under @xmath277 and @xmath278 is a probability distribution over all maps @xmath277 .",
    "one can make extra assumptions upon the statistical data obtained from space - like separated sites : each measurement site can not communicate with each other outside each other s light - cone .",

    "each of these conditions forms a hyperplane in @xmath255 and then the intersection of hyperplanes is the space of correlations that satisfies the no - signalling condition .",
    "or just as before , one can reduce the dimensionality of the space of statistics by imposing these equalities and then define inequalities on the reduced space .",
    "therefore one can construct another convex polytope called @xmath283 which is the intersection of half - spaces defined by inequalities resulting from the normalisation , positivity and no - signalling conditions @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the polytope @xmath283 in section [ sec23 ] of this chapter .",
    "now we consider the correlations that satisfy local realism , or local hidden variable theories .",
    "a bell test is an experiment that aims to test whether the statistics produced by boxes can be satisfied by a theory that obeys _",
    "local realism_. systems that satisfy local realism satisfy two conditions ( covered thoroughly in @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "realism : there are objective properties of a system that are elements , or `` hidden '' variables @xmath284 in a ( generally continuously defined ) space of hidden variables @xmath285 .",
    "these variables have a pre - existing value before the measurement is made and can influence measurement outcomes ; 2 .",
    "locality : the variables @xmath115 possessed by a party at any site are not affected by events that occur outside of the light - cone of the measurement made at this site .",
    "these variables are called _ local hidden variables _ ( lhv ) .",
    "each party s measurement is influenced by @xmath115 and the measurement choice made at that party s site . in an lhv theory , space - like separated parties can not communicate their measurement information to each other via the lhv , or any other means , due to locality .",
    "measurement outcomes are then influenced by @xmath220 and @xmath115 alone .    to be more precise ,",
    "there is a probability distribution @xmath286 over @xmath285 such that @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "this can occur , for example , if the parties have some shared source of randomness over the variables @xmath115 .",
    "therefore each set of measurement outcomes conditioned upon measurement settings can be written in the following form @xcite , @xmath289 this expression can be written in terms of a convex combination of deterministic maps @xmath290 at each site .",
    "the single site probabilities are then written as a convex combination over all deterministic maps , i.e. @xmath291 where @xmath292 are the single site maps with @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",

    "we can demonstrate this schematically in figure [ fig : space ] where we show that a facet bell inequality picks out the surface of the lhv polytope , whereas the inequalities in might just bound the lhv polytope .",
    "we will make these ideas concrete in chapter [ chap3 ] .",
    "the problem of finding the facets of a polytope given the vertices is known as the _ facet enumeration problem _ @xcite and software does exist that performs this task ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , it is currently in general both theoretically and practically hard to find these inequalities as we shall discuss in the subsequent sub - section .",

    "these ideas were also extended to the multipartite scenario @xcite .",
    "it could be argued that the result of theorem [ thm342 ] complements the idea that quantum mechanics can not simulate all non - signalling probability distributions because information processing would be rendered `` too easy '' .    in this section",

    "he established that if quantum mechanics is to be re - imagined as a local hidden variable theory , then a great deal of the theory s predictions would have to be `` thrown out '' .",
    "classical physics can be conceived as a local hidden theory , so there is an incompatibility between classical physics and quantum physics .",
    "this incompatibility is `` witnessed '' by a bell inequality : a violation indicates incompatibility .",

    "it could be argued that it was inevitable that this tool for disambiguation between classical and non - classical would be used to show that quantum correlations can perform some tasks that classical correlations can not . with the development of quantum information theory ,",

    "for example , the application of bell tests to cryptography @xcite and random number generation @xcite has been successful .",
    "quantum computation could produce an advantage over classical computers @xcite .",
    "the proof that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers would have an immense impact on the study of classical computational complexity as it would provide a separation in a conjectured hierarchy of computational models @xcite .",
    "since the bell test produces a clear cut distinction between quantum and classical , it could be considered a useful tool for proving this separation in computational models .",
    "the difficulty lies in communication , a resource not allowed in bell tests , but not prohibited in most models of computation .",
    "immediately one can suggest that we study models of computation that do not require or even limit communication .",
    "communication complexity is a model of computation that limits communication @xcite , and non - local games do not allow communication between players but to the referee @xcite .",
    "connections have been made to the latter with multi - prover interative proof systems , a model of computing based on the exchange of messages between parties in order to ascertain whether a potential solution to a problem is correct @xcite .",
    "interactive proof systems have been shown to be extremely powerful , potentially far more powerful than computations in np depending on the model @xcite . if we want to say something about classical and quantum computers , then in these `` simpler '' models we will still want to place restrictions on communication .",
    "this motivates our study of mbqc circuits where the only communication allowed is between a classical computer and measurement sties , sites can not communicate with each other and there is a single - round of measurements .    in this chapter , we began by discussing the space of lhv correlators in terms of the facet bell inequalities .",
    "finding facet bell inequalities is hard and in practice we could only find them for a limited number of @xmath573 scenarios .",
    "this motivated us to find a set of non - trivial bell inequalities .",
    "these non - trivial inequalities were motivated by our computational insight into the space of lhv correlators , and were shown to be relevant for the study of non - local games ( nlg ) .",
    "finally , our restricted class of mbqc computations was shown to be cast as an nlg , and again made relevant to non - trivial bell inequalities . using the tools from the study of bell inequalities , we showed that this restricted class of mbqc computations is not universal for quantum computing .",
    "however , in this model , due to the very nature of the bell inequality , we showed that quantum resources can do something that classical resources can not .",
    "we have shown that there are concrete connections between bell tests and some models of computing .",
    "on the other hand , we have also shown that communication in the form of adaptivity is vital for mbqc . in the next chapter",
    ", we will indicate how to simulate communication in computations within the framework of a bell test .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , this communication simulation still allows the possibility for disambiguating quantum and classical resources .",
    "the bell test has been around formally for decades .",
    "a natural question is ` can we go beyond this formulation ? ' of course , situations altering the number of parties , inputs and outputs have been studied . despite these generalizations ,",
    "the core of the gedankenexperiment still involves space - like separated parties making their measurements and then sending their data to be turned into statistics .",
    "however , in reality , data does not always emerge perfectly from experiments , and often it needs to be discarded .",
    "chsh took this imperfection into account and added an extra assumption to the construction of bell tests beyond bell s formulation : the `` fair - sampling assumption '' @xcite .",
    "this assumption essentially states that the experimental errors in performing a bell test are independent of the choice of measurement at each site . in the history of experimental tests of bell inequalities ,",
    "this assumption has featured strongly , especially in optical tests @xcite .    whilst the fair - sampling assumption may be rooted in common sense , we can not assume , in general , that it is true . however , if we relax it then the discarding of data can be problematic . in particular , it can lead to the `` detection loophole '' @xcite as it is now often referred .",
    "a `` loophole '' emerges when some imperfection in the experiment can allow lhv correlations to simulate quantum correlations .",
    "there a several sources of loopholes in experimental bell tests , some more subtle that others .    two central constraints on the construction of bell tests are measurement choice independence and space - like separation .",
    "if the latter is not respected in an experiment , then parties can communicate and from this communication , simulate whichever correlations they wish .",
    "bell has emphasized himself how important that choice of measurement be completely random and independent of the parties systems @xcite .",
    "barrett and gisin have directly related the lack of measurement choice independence to simulating communication between parties .",
    "these central stipulations of the bell test must be upheld if we want to restrict what is possible with lhv correlations .",
    "modern , photonic - based bell tests allow for space - like separated measurements @xcite .",
    "the issue of freedom of measurement choice can tend towards philosophy , and the concept of `` free will '' .",
    "these discussions are well beyond the scope of this thesis .",
    "it could be argued though that photon bell tests can also address the need for random choice of measurements @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec14 ] of chapter [ chap1 ] , random numbers can be generated by quantum processes , potentially in a device independent manner @xcite .",
    "experimental groups have exploited this source of randomness to produce random measurements @xcite .",
    "the issues raised by more systematic failures to implement bell tests are problematic .",
    "the detection loophole is a more subtle source of problems .",
    "it can be seen to result from a form of `` post - selection '' .",
    "here we use the term post - selection as a means of accepting measurement data if it satisfies particular criteria . in the case of imperfect detection",
    "where our measurement devices ( detectors ) may or may not receive a measurement outcome ( detection event ) , we can only calculate correlations for all parties if all parties have made a successful measurement .",
    "therefore , we accept or post - select on measurement data if all sites successfully detected a measurement outcome . in the first section of this chapter",
    ", we will formalise these ideas in the @xmath574 scenario .",
    "this chapter concerns itself more generally with data post - selection in bell tests .",
    "in particular , we introduce two forms of post - selection and associate a loophole with each form of post - selection . in section [ sec41 ] of this chapter , we discuss the form of post - selection in the presence of imperfect detection , whereas in section [ sec42 ] we consider post - selection in _ perfect _ bell tests . by the latter ,",
    "we mean that we have perfect detection , space - like separation and freedom of measurement choice ( the original gedankenexperiment ) but introduce a form of post - selection on accepting measurement data .",
    "whilst the post - selection in section [ sec41 ] is experimentally motivated , the post - selection in section [ sec42 ] is very much conceptually motivated . despite their differing motivation",
    "there is an overlap in the language we use to describe the loopholes .",
    "this language is rooted in our _ computational _ insight into lhv correlators .",
    "interestingly , whilst post - selection on successful detection can lead to the detection loophole ( as we shall show ) , the post - selection in section [ sec42 ] can be described as `` loophole - free '' . as well as the latter constraining lhv correlators in the presence of post - selection , it can also _ enlarge _ the space of quantum correlators .",
    "we also indicate that connections can be made between mbqc and our new form of data post - selection .",
    "finally in section [ sec43 ] , we give some indications that generalising the results of section [ sec42 ] to different @xmath573 scenarios may become problematic , and no longer loophole - free .    the original work in this chapter was developed in collaboration with dan browne .",

    "the issue of imperfect detection , culminating in the detection loophole is a subtle issue @xcite . in a full treatment of a bell test ,",
    "a non - detection of an event is in itself an event .",

    ". we can not rule out the possibility that an lhv theory can produce all @xmath846 outcomes .",
    "the fair - sampling assumption aims to exclude this possibility by saying that the non - detection event is independent of our choice of measurement @xcite .",
    "this assumption can not itself be tested .",
    "for example , we construct an explicit lhv model that violates the fair - sampling assumption but the statistics of detection are random at each site",
    ". we can not extract the dependence on @xmath227 from the statistics alone .",
    "we do not therefore impose the fair - sampling assumption in our discussion .",
    "having imperfect detectors does not necessarily mean that lhv correlators can completely simulate quantum correlators . recall that this simulation is how we describe a loophole , but we shall make this notion more rigorous in subsequent discussion . work by pearle @xcite which was then developed by garg and mermin @xcite showed that if the detector efficiency ( the ratio of successful detection to all incoming events ) at each site is above some threshold , then a loophole can be ruled out .",
    "this detection efficiency threshold has been subsequently lowered by further research @xcite .",
    "a final , somewhat more applied , motivation for considering the detection loophole comes from quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "we discussed device - independent quantum key distribution @xcite in section [ sec14 ] of the first chapter . recall that the security of device - independent quantum key distribution can be ensured by the violation of a bell inequality .",
    "the intuition is as follows : an adversary trying to learn the generated secret key ( thus able to decode any secret message ) can learn it if the key is described by an lhv . the secret information is contained in some `` local '' information at each site which can be `` extracted '' by said adversary .",
    "if the secret information is generated by some correlations incompatible with an lhv theory , then an adversary can not localise it and obtain it .",
    "the detection loophole allows an adversary to learn a secret key that can be generated by lhv resources via the loophole @xcite .",
    "we structure this section so that we introduce and describe the detection loophole .",
    "our novel insight into this loophole is to use the language of computational expressiveness to describe what lhv correlators can do in the presence of imperfect detection .",

    "we use this discussion to derive the gm threshold detector efficiency , but also to generalise their result to @xmath67 parties .",
    "we show that this threshold can be lowered by going from @xmath95 to @xmath67 parties .",
    "a previous reduction in the threshold detector efficiency for @xmath634 have resulted from considering the full probability distribution and not correlators @xcite .    in this section and the next , we will restrict ourselves to the study of bell tests in the @xmath574 scenario .",

    "how do we incorporate the issue of a non - detection event into an @xmath574 bell test ?",

    "can we still talk in terms of boolean functions if the number of outcomes at each site is ternary ? is a loophole is caused by de facto moving out of the scope of boolean functions ?",
    "we can resolve this discussion by redescribing the scenario only in terms of bit - strings .",

    "another way of asking this is to write the chsh inequalities in terms correlators @xmath861 , @xmath863 if this inequality can be violated by correlators in @xmath860 then the space @xmath860 is no longer the convex hull of linear boolean functions .",
    "we then associate this violation by lhv correlators ( in the presence of imperfect detection ) with a loophole in a bell test .",

    "the loophole means that @xmath864 could now be in the space @xmath860 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath864 could be outside of @xmath860 , but the facet bell inequalities for @xmath434 are possibly no longer relevant for informing us either way .",

    "we show that it is possible that @xmath860 can no longer be confined to the convex hull of linear boolean functions .",

    "the @xmath865 sites for @xmath866 have perfect detectors whereas the first site has an imperfect detector .",

    "the variable @xmath872 is shared by all parties , and the second party s measurement outcome @xmath873 . if for all @xmath865 sites where @xmath874 , the parties measurement outcomes upon successful detection are @xmath875 , then when @xmath853 , @xmath876 .",
    "the resulting correlator is then @xmath877 , which is a vertex outside of the convex hull of linear boolean functions .",
    "@xmath163    this demonstrates how post - selection can be problematic in bell tests .",
    "a drawback of the proof of the above result is the asymmetry in the detectors between the first detector and the rest .",
    "if we were to switch the detectors in the experiment and still got the same imperfect detection at site @xmath66 then the rate of detection must be independent of the detector .",
    "the measure of detection is the detection efficiency @xmath878 which is the quotient of number of successful detections to the number of events incoming to the detector .",
    "we can obtain the efficiency of a detector if two sites each make measurements , and then condition the statistics of the detector upon the other detecting an event so that @xmath879 we assume that the detector efficiency @xmath878 is the same for all @xmath67 sites . situations with non - uniform @xmath878 amongst parties have been investigated ( e.g. @xcite ) but is beyond the scope of our discussion here .",
    "in the early literature discussing the detection loophole ( e.g. @xcite ) , the probabilities in are calculated from the number @xmath880 of events where @xmath852 occured .",
    "it is assumed that the number of events where @xmath881 is unobservable as they are non - events .",
    "probabilities then become normalised relative to this inability to detect when @xmath881 and @xmath882 then for the above discussion about @xmath878 for @xmath95 parties , @xmath880 being the number of events where @xmath883 occurs , the total number of events is @xmath884 .",

    "this is not as strong as the fair - sampling assumption and we can experimentally test whether single - site detection statistics are independent of @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "this reinforces the intuition that the properties of a detector such as @xmath878 should be independent of whatever measurement we make .    in line with previous research such as in @xcite",

    "the space @xmath898 is a sub - space of @xmath900 which is now the space of all possible vectors of expectation values @xmath894 .",
    "we now address the @xmath634 scenario and use it to give an upper bound on the detection efficiency @xmath878 required in order to demonstrate a violation of the chsh inequality in the presence of imperfect detectors .",
    "this upper bound was derived by gm @xcite and has since been improved upon by eberhard @xcite in the clauser - horne inequality setting @xcite . as an aside , it has been suggested that if we consider different bell test settings , we can lower the detection efficiency required to violate any bell inequality @xcite .",
    "we will use our computational interpretation of correlators to rederive the gm upper bound on the threshold detection efficiency @xmath878 . in order to do this ,",

    "we can maintain the same probability @xmath921 while making the detection efficiency the same for both sides if both parties share a random bit @xmath922 .",
    "when @xmath923 , @xmath924 and @xmath869 , and when @xmath925 , @xmath870 and @xmath926 .",

    "we have taken the convex combination with positive coefficients @xmath936 , @xmath937 such that @xmath938 .",

    "we now describe how we can achieve the vertex @xmath857 of @xmath854 corresponding to the function @xmath952 with lhv correlators .",
    "we do this by simulating the above communication protocol using detection post - selection .",
    "we call this post - selection protocol the `` mermin - klyshko post - selection '' ( mkp ) protocol : each @xmath137th party for @xmath956 produces the map @xmath957 where all @xmath67 parties share the @xmath865 bit - values @xmath958",

    "that is , even if we imbue lhv correlators with more computational power ( as with ai ) , quantum correlators can still have more computational expressiveness .",
    "it would be an interesting avenue of research to consider how quantum correlators are affected by non - loophole - free post - selection and whether their power can always be `` boosted '' by this post - selection .",
    "the practical motivations of implementing bell tests in the laboratory have motivated the study of loopholes and how they emerge when we have to reject `` imperfect '' measurement data @xcite . in this chapter",
    "we have used the insight from considering bell tests from a computational point - of - view to say how and why loopholes emerge . by post - selecting on measurement data only when we have successful detection",
    ", we establish a relationship between the inputs and local hidden variables .",
    "this relationship allows other parties to indirectly learn the inputs of other sites via this shared data . by modelling this behaviour we retrieved the gm @xcite bound on the necessary detection efficiency required to establish a loophole - free violation of a bell inequality .",
    "we then subsequently improved upon their bound by considering more parties .",
    "our improvement on the gm bound is not as impressive as the improvement attained by eberhard @xcite in the clauser - horne inequality setting .",
    "eberhard s bound of @xmath1176 has been improved upon further @xcite , this was a result of considering more measurement settings at each site .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the bell inequalities on the full probability distribution for @xmath574 for @xmath464 , and whether the detection efficiency can be lowered further in analogy to our results .    despite the issues associated with post - selection ,",
    "there is a scenario where if we have perfect detections but the experimenter post - selects on measurement data by choice , we do not introduce loopholes .",
    "we associate lhv correlators with a limited computational expressiveness in the @xmath574 scenario : only linear boolean functions can be achieved .",
    "if we post - select on data but only in a way that does not introduce non - linear boolean functions , we avoid loopholes and still allow the possibility for a violation of a bell inequality .",
    "in fact , we can increase the amount of quantum violation for particular bell inequalities if we utilise post - selection .",
    "however , we have also shown that the @xmath574 scenario is unique in the respect of not introducing loopholes ; if we allow a greater number of inputs and outputs at each site , loopholes can again emerge . for @xmath1177 ,",
    "lhv correlators can produce powers of its input , and this inherent multiplication can be used to simulate all possible correlators . the ability to produce addition and multiplication modulo @xmath9 for @xmath9 being prime can be enough to produce any function @xmath1178 .",
    "this has highlighted both how fragile bell tests are in establishing a distinction between quantum and lhv correlators , and also how much descriptive power is accumulated by considering bell tests from the computational point - of - view . since we have shown the intimate link between correlators and functions on digit - strings , discussing functions has allowed to capture part of the picture of loopholes in bell tests .",
    "interestingly , the models of post - selection we have discussed for @xmath574 involve the same level of data processing involved in mbqc .",
    "with lio post - selection , we can simulate time - like separated processes such as adaptive mbqc circuits without introducing loopholes .",
    "modelling signalling processes within bell tests could lead to an insight into why we obtain improvements in information processing for quantum resources .",
    "we will summarise and consider some of these ideas in the final chapter .",
    "the bell inequalities have dictated and continue to dictate much of the discussion about the nature of quantum mechanics . in this thesis",
    "we have suggested that a general framework for bell tests has a computational aspect .",
    "this both allows us to use methods and ideas in computer science to say something about bell tests and methods developed in bell tests to say something about computation .",
    "this collaboration between applied and fundamental science is what drives a large part of quantum information science @xcite .",
    "the diversity of connections addressed in this thesis have been made between the cglmp - type bell tests and basic number theory ( in the form of functions on cyclic groups ) ; loopholes , post - selection and quantum computing ; we also connected quantum computing to non - local games and ww bell tests .    in chapter [ chap2 ]",
    ", we outlined our approach to bell tests , in particular looking at correlators : the expectation value of joint measurements .",
    "we showed that correlators can be associated with a notion of computation , that is functions on inputs .",
    "the calculation of a correlator maps raw statistical data into a stochastic map from inputs to a single output .",
    "this operational description allows to then think about information processing",
    ". this framework and description also has something to say about non - signalling theories and svetlichny s model of correlations .",
    "the discussion of correlators in chapter [ chap2 ] was mostly in terms of the vertex description of convex polytopes . in chapter [ chap3 ]",
    ", we shifted to discussing the bell inequality as defining the convex polytope of lhv correlators .",
    "we used the vertex description from chapter [ chap2 ] to numerically calculate the linear inequalities , or facet bell inequalities that define this polytope .",
    "however , it was only computationally feasible to find these inequalities for a relatively small number of settings .",
    "given the hardness of the computational problem , we then just discussed non - trivial bell inequalities , relaxing the need for the inequality to be facet - defining , but still potentially be violated .",
    "these non - trivial expressions then necessarily bound the space of lhv correlators to be smaller than the space of all possible correlators .",
    "non - trivial bell inequalities are not only useful for bounding classical correlations , they have a natural interpretation in terms of non - local games .",
    "we looked at these non - local games in the many party , two - input , two - output scenario and showed that they have a concrete connection to measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc ) .",
    "in particular , nmbqc , the class of non - adaptive circuits in the raussendorf and briegel model of mbqc can be shown to be inequivalent to a full quantum computer . however , within this nmbqc structure we still obtain natural generalisations of both the ghz paradox and pr non - local box .",
    "an interesting aspect of the nmbqc model is that data processing by a classical computer does not imbue lhv theories with any more computational power . in chapter [ chap4 ]",
    ", we applied this insight to data post - selection in bell tests .",
    "we showed that post - selection in bell tests , such as post - selecting on detecting outcomes in imperfect experiments , is problematic and introduces `` loopholes '' .",
    "we used the computational insight from the rest of the thesis to show how the detection loophole can emerge and then rederived the garg - mermin bound on detection efficiency @xcite . throughout this discussion",
    "our computational perspective drove the understanding of loopholes .    after showing how in imperfect experimental bell tests , loopholes can emerge",
    ", we turned to a different framework for data post - selection .",
    "we assume that we have perfect detection and data collection , but we post - select on inputs satisfying certain constraints .",
    "we showed that lhv correlators are unaffected in their computational expressiveness by this post - selection .",
    "we associate this conservation of computational power with the post - selection being `` loophole - free '' .",
    "the notion of a loophole in both frameworks for post - selection is heuristically connected as allowing lhv correlators to have more computational expressiveness than just the linear boolean functions .",
    "the post - selection in the second framework is loophole - free if we constrain its form .",
    "these constraints however can still allow the post - selection to simulate the processing a classical computer imposes on data sent to measurement sites in mbqc .",
    "also we can simulate signalling processes with this post - selection .",
    "this offers a potentially fruitful way of viewing quantum protocols and processes that have time - like separated elements into a framework where processes are now in the context of space - like separated parties .",
    "all of these results were developed in the @xmath574 scenario , and we showed that generalisations of these methods to other scenarios is problematic , thus highlighting the uniqueness of lhv expressed in terms of linear boolean functions .",
    "the work in this thesis is by no means a complete analysis of the role of computation in bell tests , but perhaps strengthens the study of the relationship between the two .",
    "there is much work to be done still in understanding quantum correlations and whilst we have discovered new phenomena , the characterisation of quantum correlations remains broadly ill - understood .",
    "we have conjectured that all quantum correlators for the bipartite scenario can be captured by a particular set of quantum operators in the navacus - pironio - acn hierarchy .",
    "it would be of great interest if this were true and if a similar behaviour occurred in the multipartite setting .",
    "this is an immediate problem raised by work in this thesis and worth pursuing as a continuation .    in recent years , a significant amount of effort into classifying the geometric nature of non - signalling correlations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that some of the extremal structure of the polytope of non - signalling theories can be revealed by the extremal structure of correlators .",
    "it would be interesting to see if there is a connection between correlators and the rest of the vertices of the non - signalling polytope .",
    "this picture is not clear as some of the non - lhv vertices of the non - signalling polytope for @xmath625 do not violate any of the facet bell inequalities for correlators in this setting .",
    "however , the generality of the correlator description in terms of computations could give a handle on some of these ideas .",
    "continuing with the theme of characterising the full probability distribution instead of correlators , it would be interesting to study the effect of data post - selection on non - signalling resources .",
    "the difficulty in relating the inputs of parties to each other as we have done can allow lhv resources to achieve correlations that violate locality .",
    "since in the correlator framework all single - site maps get mapped to a single output , this violation of locality has little or no effect",
    ". it would be interesting to allow resources that exploit `` non - locality '' in this way but still can not produce something that quantum mechanics can produce .",
    "this is akin to the detector loophole where the lhv region is enlarged by post - selection , but below a threshold detection efficiency , still is not large enough to simulate quantum correlators .",
    "can our approach to correlators in terms of functions to applied to other issues in the study of bell tests ?",
    "an interesting potential avenue for further research could be the `` monogamy of bell correlations '' @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the `` monogamy of entanglement '' where we have three parties and if two parties are maximally entangled then the third party can not be entangled with either of these two parties .",
    "it has been shown that bell correlations behave in an analogous fashion where if two parties out of three violate a bipartite bell inequality , then the correlations between either of these two parties and a third party can not achieve a violation of the same inequality .",
    "this has been generalised to many parties with these parties divided into two overlapping sets @xcite .",
    "can the language of functions , or computations explain that if one set of parties is trying to perform a computation , then by a satisfiability argument , the other set can not produce this same function ?    finally ,",
    "since we have established a connection between mbqc and bell tests , it would be interesting to simulate quantum computations such as , say , shor s algorithm @xcite and see if it violates a bell inequality .",
    "in some sense then it could be seen that this computation can not be resolved with a classical picture of the world , or it would highlight the non - classical aspects of this algorithm .",
    "post - selection and quantum computation have been studied before by scott aaronson @xcite , in a different format to our own framework .",
    "it was shown by aaronson that quantum computation with post - selection of a different kind to ours is incredibly powerful .",
    "speculatively , there may be some connection between our work and ideas in computational complexity .",
    "we have already made the connection to the class iqp @xcite , this class may be amenable to the study of our bell tests with post - selection .",
    "we hope to address the issues raised by this thesis in further research .",
    "we also hope that the work presented has produced the motivation to consider `` device - independent '' computing .",
    "this would be the ability to confirm that we have built something that uses quantum mechanics to compute but without knowing anything about the device .",
    "we have shown that the bell inequality is a useful metric for quantum behaviour , in particular with regards to computation .",
    "more importantly , we hope that the work in this thesis can lead to new approaches of thinking about bell tests , perhaps motivated by computation .",
    "n. david mermin once quoted a `` distinguished princeton physicist '' as saying @xcite,``anybody who s not bothered by bell s theorem has to have rocks in his head . ''",
    "the bell inequality has been a profound addition to science and we hope that the work in this thesis contributes to new aspects of its study .",

    "<S> the predictions of quantum mechanics can not be resolved with a completely classical view of the world . in particular , the statistics of space - like separated measurements on entangled quantum systems violate a bell inequality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we put forward a computational perspective on a broad class of bell tests that study correlators , or the statistics of joint measurement outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> we associate particular maps , or functions to particular theories . </S>",
    "<S> the violation of a bell inequality then implies the ability to perform some functions , or computations that classical , or more generally , local hidden variable ( lhv ) theories can not .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive an infinite class of bell inequalities that establish a link to so - called `` non - local games '' </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then make the connection between raussendorf and briegel s formulation of measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc ) @xcite , and these non - local games . not only </S>",
    "<S> can we show that a quantum violation implies a computational advantage in this model , we show that adaptive measurements are required to perform all quantum computations .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explore post - selection of data in bell tests from both a practical and conceptual point - of - view , with particular consideration to so - called `` loopholes '' . </S>",
    "<S> loopholes allow lhv theories to simulate quantum correlations through post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> we give a computational description of how loopholes can emerge in different post - selection scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to find a form of post - selection that does not lead to loopholes . </S>",
    "<S> central again to this discussion is the description of lhv theories in terms of computations .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , quantum correlators can be made more `` non - classical '' with this loophole - free post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> this method of post - selection also can simulate information processing tasks , such as mbqc , that have time - like separated components . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up new avenues for the study of time - like tasks studied within the space - like separated scenario of the bell test . </S>"
