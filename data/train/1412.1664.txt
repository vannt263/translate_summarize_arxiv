    "the centers occupied by single spin - polarized electrons act as a spin filter @xcite and block the free electrons of the same spin polarization from escaping from the conduction band . as a result the spin polarization of free photoelectrons generated by circularly polarized optical excitation ( as well as that of bound electrons ) can be enhanced up to @xmath6100% .",

    "in addition , strong nuclear polarization effects , due to a combination of the spin - dependent recombination and hyperfine coupling , have been reported and discussed in refs .",
    "particularly , the dynamically polarized nuclei create an effective magnetic field ( the overhauser field ) acting on the spins of localized electrons ; this field is added to the external magnetic field and shifts the ` electron polarization vs. field ' curve , with the shift changing the sign under reversal of the circular polarization of the exciting light @xcite .",
