    "<S> we investigate the implication of different elastic spin - dependent ( sd ) operators on both the direct and indirect detections of the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) . </S>",
    "<S> six representative building blocks of sd operators , together with their counterparts with a massless mediator , are considered to interpret the direct detection experiments  ( xenon100 , simple , and coupp ) in a comprehensive way . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the solar capture and annihilation of wimps with these effective sd operators and place the constraints on the relevant annihilation rate from neutrino detection experiments super - kamionkande and icecube . </S>",
    "<S> upper limits on the wimp - nucleon couplings drawn from direct detections are also projected to the annihilation rate for contrast and complementarity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the efficiency of these mentioned detection strategies depends specifically on the six sd operators , while the neutrino - based detections are more effective in exploring the parameter space for the massless mediator scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been well confirmed through decades of endeavor in cosmological observation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the nature of the dm still remains a challenging problem for particle physics . among those mechanisms and dm candidates , the </S>",
    "<S> weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is one of the most promising . in this picture , the wimps interact with the standard model particles through weak interactions and naturally result in the thermal relic density consistent with the observation , called the `` wimp miracle . '' </S>",
    "<S> both theoretical and experimental attempts have been made to account for and search for such particles . </S>",
    "<S> many direct detection groups have reported their results based on the conventional elastic spin - independent ( si ) or spin - dependent ( sd ) effective operator that is proportional to a constant , @xmath0 , or to the dot product between the spins of the wimp and quark , @xmath1 . however , </S>",
    "<S> if we broaden our study to more general dm scenarios such as isospin - violating dm  @xcite , long - range force dm  @xcite , inelastic dm  @xcite , and form factor dm  @xcite , the interpretation of the experimental results may turn out to be quite different . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility has been used in attempts to alleviate the conflicts between different direct detection experiments  @xcite .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , several groups began to systematically study the dm direct detection in terms of the nonrelativistic ( nr ) effective field theory  @xcite , in which a given lorentz - invariant interaction is expanded with a complete set of nr effective operators at the nucleon level , along with the corresponding galilean and rotational invariant coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have further calculated the relevant nuclear form factors associated with different effective operators beyond the simplest si and sd case , for the elements common in the present - day detectors . besides </S>",
    "<S> , a state - of - the - art large - scale nuclear structure calculation for different operators has also been planned in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further knowledge about the nuclear form factors is important for us to interpret the detection results in a more comprehensive way .    besides direct detection efforts </S>",
    "<S> , some indirect approaches are also expected to be effective in constraining the coupling strength between the wimp and nucleon  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one may regard the solar neutrinos that are detected by the neutrino detectors ( e.g. , super - kamionkande  @xcite or icecube  @xcite ) as the possible annihilation products of the trapped wimps residing in the center region of the sun , so as to impose upper limits on the wimp - nucleus coupling coefficients , which is relevant to the wimp capture rate and thus to the neutrino flux , if an equilibrium between capture and annihilation is assumed .    the implications of a wide variety of elastic si interactions on both the direct and indirect detection experiments have been studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which the direct detections are proved to be more effective in constraining the wimp - nucleon interaction couplings with a sensitivity @xmath2 orders of magnitude greater than the neutrino - based approach . </S>",
    "<S> however , given that the upper limit on the elastic sd wimp - nucleon cross section is far above that of the si interaction , one would expect the neutrino - based detection to compete with or even exceed the direct detections in sensitivity for effective sd operators </S>",
    "<S> . we will study in this paper the direct detection of the wimps with a set of effective elastic sd operators , as well as the relevant indirect detection in a similar way with @xcite and compare them with each other in sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> we organize these discussions as follows : in sec . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effective sd operators in a systematic manner and the relevant consequences for various wimp direct detection experiments . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> we study the solar capture of the wimp in detail and calculate the bounds on the capture rate @xmath3 , and the annihilation rate @xmath4 , imposed by both the direct detection experiments and the neutrino detectors super - kamionkande and icecube , for the purpose of comparison and complementarity . </S>",
