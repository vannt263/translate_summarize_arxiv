    "some typical examples are presented in  @xcite .",

    "the aim of this article is to explain a transform on dolbeault cohomology for double fibrations of this type and then execute the transform in this particular case .",
    "then , since the bott - borel - weil theorem  @xcite computes the dolbeault cohomology of @xmath30 with coefficients in any homogeneous vector bundle , we may draw conclusions concerning the cohomology of various elliptic complexes on  @xmath31 .",

    "there is a better established double fibration transform defined for @xmath32 in which all manifolds are complex and both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are holomorphic .",
    "classical twistor theory , for example , is concerned with the holomorphic correspondence @xmath35 the penrose transform in this setting is explained in  @xcite and generalised to arbitrary holomorphic correspondences between complex flag manifolds in  @xcite .",
    "another vast generalisation is concerned with the holomorphic correspondences arising from the cycle spaces of general flag domains as in  @xcite .    on the face of it , the double fibration ( [ balanced ] )",
    "is of a different nature since @xmath31 is only to be considered as a smooth manifold .",
    "in fact , a link will emerge with the complex correspondences and this will ease some of the computations involved . for the moment , however , let us develop some general machinery applicable to this _ smooth _ setting .",
    "this machinery is a generalisation of the penrose transform for a single fibration  ( [ twistorfibration ] ) , which goes as follows .",
    "the only requirements on ( [ twistorfibration ] ) are that @xmath5 should be a smooth submersion from a complex manifold @xmath3 to a smooth manifold @xmath1 and that the fibres of @xmath5 should be compact complex submanifolds of  @xmath3 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath36 the bundle of @xmath37-forms on  @xmath3 and by @xmath38 the @xmath39-operator on @xmath3 so that @xmath40 is the dolbeault cohomology of  @xmath3 .",

    "an immediate consequence is that the bundle @xmath45 acquires a holomorphic structure along the fibres of  @xmath5 . to see this by hand ,",
    "one notes that the composition @xmath50 vanishes by dint of the definition ( [ bizarre ] ) of @xmath45 and the commutative diagram  ( [ acquired ] ) whence the short exact sequence @xmath51\\to \\lambda_\\tau^{0,1}\\otimes\\lambda_\\mu^{1,0}\\to 0\\ ] ] induced by ( [ bizarre ] ) implies that @xmath52 induces an operator @xmath53 as required . to see this ( and much more ) by machinery ,",
    "one employs the spectral sequence of the filtered complex  @xmath54 , arriving at the @xmath55-level @xmath56 and , in particular , the differential @xmath57 . this spectral sequence for @xmath58 , at the @xmath59-level , reads @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath62 direct image of the vector bundle @xmath63 with respect to its holomorphic structure in the fibre directions .",

    "let us define a bundle @xmath69 on @xmath70 by means of the short exact sequence @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the bundle of complex - valued @xmath41-forms on  @xmath70 .",

    "@xcite on  @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , there is an induced complex of differential operators @xmath73 comparing ( [ involutive ] ) with the bundle @xmath74 of @xmath41-forms along the fibres of @xmath27 defined by the short exact sequence @xmath75 we see that there is a short exact sequence @xmath76 the complex @xmath77 thereby acquires a filtration , the spectral sequence for which reads at the @xmath55-level @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the exterior derivative along the fibres of @xmath27 coupled with the pullback bundle @xmath80 .",
    "notice that such a coupling @xmath81 is valid for any smooth vector bundle @xmath8 on @xmath3 because the pullback @xmath82 may be defined by transition functions that are constant along the fibres , hence annihilated by  @xmath83 .",

    ".    nevertheless , we may deal with the fibration @xmath89 exactly as in our proof of theorem  [ basic ] .",
    "specifically , we define a bundle @xmath45 on @xmath70 by the exact sequence @xmath90 and employ the spectral sequence of the corresponding filtered complex @xmath91 to conclude that the following theorem holds .    [",

    "another thing we need in order to apply theorem  [ advanced ] is a computation of the direct images @xmath61 as homogeneous bundles on  @xmath31 .",

    "hence it splits as @xmath106 in line with the complex structure on the ambient double fibration . for any double fibration",

    "finally , it is left to the reader also to check that the holomorphic structure for the bundle @xmath45 on @xmath70 along the fibres of  @xmath5 coincides with the standard holomorphic structure along the fibres of @xmath33 for the bundle @xmath45 on @xmath103 when restricted to @xmath117 .    in summary , for a double fibration of the form  ( [ smoothdoublefibration ] )",

    "the author suspects that the holomorphic tangent bundle @xmath217 will give rise to an especially interesting complex ( since @xmath218 parameterises the infinitesimal deformations of  @xmath3 as a complex manifold ) .",
    "unfortunately , he has not yet been able to complete the calculation in this case .",
    "this section is concerned with an instance of the holomorphic double fibration transform as formulated in general in  @xcite .",
    "specifically , let us consider the complex flag manifold @xmath30 under the action of @xmath219 .",
    "there are three open orbits for this action , easily described in terms of geometry in  @xmath31 .",
    "the orbits of @xmath219 acting on @xmath31 are the open ball @xmath220 , its boundary , and the complement of its closure . as in  [ intro ] and   [ particular ] , an element @xmath221 in @xmath3 may be viewed as a point on a hyperplane in  @xmath31 .",
    "the three open orbits are given by the following restrictions .",
    "* the point @xmath17 lies in the ball  @xmath220 , * the hyperplane @xmath124 lies outside the ball @xmath220 , * the point @xmath17 lies outside @xmath220 but the hyperplane @xmath124 intersects  @xmath220 .",
    "the set of hyperplanes lying outside @xmath220 defines an open subset in the dual projective space  @xmath222 , which we may identify with  @xmath223 , i.e.  the ball @xmath220 with its conjugate complex structure .",
    "let us consider the third of the options above for the open orbits of @xmath219 acting on @xmath3 and call it  @xmath224 . by definition",
    "flag domain_. following the notation of  @xcite , its _ cycle space _",
    "@xmath225 is @xmath226 inside @xmath227 and the correspondence space @xmath228 is exactly @xmath229 for the complexified correspondence of   [ particular ] .",
    "thus , we have an open inclusion @xmath230{${\\mathbb{m}}$ } } \\put(25,30){\\vector(-1,-1){18 } } \\put(35,30){\\vector(1,-1){18 } } \\put(12,24){\\makebox(0,0){$\\mu$ } } \\put(48,24){\\makebox(0,0){$\\nu$ } } \\end{picture}}\\ ] ] and , in particular , the fibres of @xmath34 over @xmath225 coincide with the fibres of @xmath231 restricted to  @xmath225 .",
    "the spectral sequence  @xcite for the resulting double fibration transform starting with a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath232 on @xmath224 reads @xmath233 under the assumptions that @xmath225 is stein and that @xmath234 has contractible fibres , both of which are true for any flag domain  @xcite and directly seen to be the case here .",
    "observe that the terms in this spectral sequence ( when @xmath232 is trivial ) are almost the same as in  ( [ ss ] ) .",
    "certainly , the direct image bundles may be obtained by working on the homogeneous correspondence  ( [ homogeneous ] ) and then restricting to  @xmath225 . as our final example , let us carry this out for @xmath120 and for @xmath232 being the canonical bundle on  @xmath224 .",
    "this is precisely the restriction to @xmath224 of the homogeneous line bundle @xmath235 on  @xmath3 . following exactly the procedures of   [ particular ] we find the following homogeneous bundles for @xmath236.@xmath237 \\oplus ( 2\\,\\|\\,2\\,|\\,{-1}\\,|\\,{-3})\\\\ \\hline p=3&\\hspace{-5pt}\\begin{array}{c } ( -1\\,\\|\\,2\\,|\\,1\\,|\\,{-2})+(-1\\,\\|\\,3\\,|\\,0\\,|\\,{-2})\\\\ \\oplus\\\\ ( 1\\,\\|\\,2\\,|\\,{-1}\\,|\\,{-2})+(1\\,\\|\\,2\\,|\\,0\\,|\\,{-3})\\hspace{5pt } \\end{array}\\\\ \\hline p=4&(0\\,\\|\\,2\\,|\\,0\\,|\\,{-2 } ) \\end{array}\\]]using the bott - borel - weil theorem , as formulated in  @xcite",
