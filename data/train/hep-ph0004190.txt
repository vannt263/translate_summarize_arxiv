    "the search for flavour - changing neutral ( fcn ) current processes both at high and low energies is one of the major tools to test the standard model ( sm ) , with the potential for either discovering or putting stringent limits on new physics . in the sm",
    ", there are no gauge fcn couplings at tree level due to the gim mechanism , and scalar couplings are also automatically flavour - diagonal provided only one higgs doublet is introduced . however , there is no fundamental reason for having only one higgs doublet , and for two or more scalar doublets fcn couplings are generated at tree level unless an _",
    "ad hoc _ discrete symmetry is imposed @xcite .",
    "there are stringent limits on the fcn couplings between light quarks arising from the smallness of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 mass differences @xcite , as well as from the cp violation parameter @xmath6 of the neutral kaon system . if there is no suppression of scalar fcn couplings , the masses of the neutral higgs bosons have to be of the order of 1 tev .",
    "however , if fcn couplings between light quarks are suppressed , being for instance proportional to the quark masses @xcite or to some combination of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing angles @xcite , the lightest neutral higgs may have a mass @xmath7 of around 100 gev . in this case , the effects of scalar fcn currents involving the top quark can be quite sizeable .",
    "the interactions among the top , a light quark @xmath8 and a higgs boson @xmath9 will be described by the effective lagrangian @xmath10 the axial and vector parts of the coupling are normalized to @xmath11 .",
    "the natural size of @xmath12 in a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) is @xmath13 , leading to large fcn current effects observable at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the natural size of @xmath14 ranges from 0.012 to 0.025 , depending on the model considered .",
    "this is too small to be observed , but if this coupling is enhanced by a factor @xmath15 , it could also be detected .",
    "models with new heavy exotic quarks can also have large tree level @xmath16 couplings , with the particularity that they are proportional to the fcn @xmath17 couplings @xcite .",
    "present limits on the latter @xcite allow for @xmath18 or @xmath19 , both observable at lhc .",
    "the large top quark mass opens the possibility of having relatively large effective vertices @xmath16 induced at one loop by new physics . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) there are large regions of the parameter space where one can have @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "is much smaller in principle . ]",
    "in contrast , in the sm the effective @xmath21 vertex is very small , @xmath22 due to a strong gim cancellation @xcite .",
    "the large top quark mass also suggests that the top quark could play a fundamental rle in the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite and in this case top fcn scalar couplings would be large , @xmath23 @xcite or @xmath24 @xcite , depending on the model considered .",
    "hence the importance of measuring its couplings , in particular to the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "present experimental bounds on top fcn scalar ( and gauge ) couplings are very weak .",
    "some processes have been proposed to measure the @xmath16 vertices , for instance @xmath25 and @xmath26 production at a linear collider with a center of mass ( cm ) energy of @xmath27 tev @xcite and @xmath28 production at a muon collider @xcite or at hadron colliders via gluon fusion @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "these processes can probe the fcn couplings of the heavier mass eigenstates , but do not provide useful limits for the light scalars . in this letter",
    "we will show that top decays @xmath30 at lhc provide the best limits on the couplings of a light scalar of a mass slightly above 100 gev .",
    "the importance of this mass range stems from the fact that global fits to electroweak observables in the sm @xcite seem to prefer @xmath31 gev , as well as the mssm prediction that the mass of the lightest scalar has to be less than 130 gev @xcite . on the other hand , direct searches at the cern @xmath32 collider lep at cm energies up to 202 gev",
    "imply the bound @xmath33 gev for the mass of a sm higgs , with a 95% confidence level ( cl ) @xcite .",
    "for the lightest higgs of the mssm the bounds depend on the choice of parameters and typically are reduced to @xmath34 gev .    in the following",
    "we will perform a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the lhc to fcn scalar couplings in top decays @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we will also study @xmath35 production , which also serves to constrain the @xmath16 vertex @xcite .",
    "however , the bounds obtained from this process are much less restrictive .",
    "finally , we will comment on the potential of the lhc to discover these signals at the rates predicted by some models .",
    "to obtain constraints on the coupling @xmath36 we will first consider @xmath37 production , with the top quark decaying to @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the antitop decaying to @xmath40 . with a good @xmath41 identification the decays @xmath42 can be included , improving the statistical significance of the signal .",
    "the decay mode of the higgs boson depends strongly on its mass . for our evaluation",
    ", we take @xmath43 gev , well above the lep limits , and decaying into @xmath44 pairs . in principle , there is no reason to assume that the @xmath45 coupling is suppressed . in a general 2hdm , both doublets couple to the @xmath46 quark and , unless some fine - tuned cancellation occurs , the coupling of the physical light higgs to the @xmath46 quark is proportional to the @xmath46 mass , which we take @xmath47 gev at the scale @xmath48 . to be conservative , we assume that the higgs couplings to the gauge bosons are not suppressed and are the same as in the sm .",
    "thus for @xmath49 gev @xmath9 decays predominantly into @xmath44 pairs , with a branching ratio of @xmath50 . for @xmath51 gev , the @xmath52 decay mode , with one of the @xmath53 s off - shell , begins to dominate .",
    "is a pseudoscalar , the signal will get an enhancement factor of roughly @xmath54 and the @xmath44 decay mode will dominate also for larger values of @xmath7 . ]",
    "the signal is then @xmath55 , with three @xmath46 quarks in the final state .",
    "clearly , @xmath46 tagging is crucial to separate the signal from the backgrounds .",
    "we assume a @xmath46 tagging efficiency of 50% , and a mistag rate of 1% , similar to the values recently achieved at sld @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the signal using the full @xmath56 matrix elements with all intermediate particles off - shell .",
    "we calculate the matrix elements using helas @xcite code generated by madgraph @xcite and modified to include the decay chain . for definiteness",
    "we assume @xmath57 , @xmath58 , but we check that the difference when using other combinations is below @xmath59 .",
    "we normalize the cross section with a @xmath60 factor of 2.0 @xcite .",
    "the main background to this signal comes from @xmath61 production with standard top and antitop decays , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "this process mimics the signal if one of the jets resulting from the @xmath64 decay is mistagged as a @xmath46 jet .",
    "the matrix elements for this process are calculated with helas and madgraph in the same way as the signal , taking again @xmath65 .",
    "another background to be considered is @xmath66 production , for which we use vecbos @xcite modified to include energy smearing and trigger and kinematical cuts . for this process",
    "we take @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "@xmath68 production is negligible after using @xmath46 tagging . for the phase space integration we use mrst structure functions",
    "set a @xcite with @xmath69 .",
    "after generating signals and backgrounds , we simulate the detector resolution effects with a gaussian smearing of the energies of jets @xmath70 and charged leptons @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 where the energies are in gev and the two terms are added in quadrature .",
    "we then apply detector cuts on transverse momenta @xmath73 , pseudorapidities @xmath74 and distances in @xmath75 space @xmath76 : @xmath77 @xmath78 for the events to be triggered , we require both the signal and background to fulfill at least one of the trigger conditions @xcite .",
    "these conditions are different in the low 10 fb@xmath79  ( l ) and high 100 fb@xmath79  ( h ) luminosity runs . for our processes ,",
    "the relevant conditions are    * one jet with @xmath80 gev ( l ) / 290 gev ( h ) , * three jets with @xmath81 gev ( l ) / 130 gev ( h ) , * one charged lepton with @xmath82 gev ( l ) / 30 gev ( h ) , * missing energy @xmath83 gev ( l ) / 100 gev ( h ) and one jet with @xmath84 gev ( l ) / 100 gev ( h ) .    we reconstruct the signal as follows .",
    "there are three tagged @xmath46 jets @xmath85 in the final state and a non-@xmath46 jet @xmath70 .",
    "there are three possible pairs @xmath86 , with invariant masses @xmath87 , one of which results from the decay of the higgs boson and has an invariant mass close to @xmath7 .",
    "the invariant mass of this pair and the jet @xmath70 , @xmath88 , is also close to the top mass .",
    "hence we choose the pair @xmath89 which minimizes @xmath90 , defining the higgs reconstructed mass as @xmath91 and the antitop reconstructed mass as @xmath92 . in figs",
    "[ fig:1 ] ,  [ fig:2 ] we plot the kinematical distributions of these variables for the signal and for the @xmath61 background .",
    "the @xmath93 distribution is slightly broader for @xmath61 due to the signal reconstruction method .",
    "the remaining jet @xmath94 and the charged lepton result from the decay of the top quark . to reconstruct its mass",
    ", we make the hypothesis that all missing energy comes from a single neutrino with @xmath95 , and @xmath96 the missing transverse momentum . using @xmath97",
    "we find two solutions for @xmath98 , and we choose that one making the reconstructed top mass @xmath99 closest to @xmath100 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we plot the kinematical distribution of this variable for the signal and @xmath61 background .",
    "the reconstruction of the signal and the requirement @xmath101 , @xmath102 are sufficient to eliminate the @xmath103 background , but hardly affect @xmath61 , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig:1][fig:3 ] . to improve the signal to background ratio we reject events when one pair of jets , @xmath104 or @xmath105 , seems to be the product of the hadronic decay of a @xmath53 boson , as happens for the @xmath61 background .",
    "we define the reconstructed @xmath53 mass as the invariant mass @xmath106 , @xmath107 closest to @xmath108 ( see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) and impose a veto cut on events with @xmath109 .",
    "the limits obtained for different values of @xmath7 are very similar . for a lighter higgs ,",
    "the larger phase space ( in the case of top decays ) or the larger structure functions ( in @xmath35 production ) increase the signal cross section and hence allow a better determination of @xmath36 .",
    "this improvement disappears when expressing the limit in terms of a branching ratio . after repeating the analysis using @xmath111 , @xmath112",
    ", we find limits @xmath113 smaller from top decays and @xmath114 smaller from @xmath35 production .",
    "a heavier higgs has the opposite behaviour , with the disadvantage of a smaller branching ratio @xmath115 . with @xmath116 , @xmath117",
    "the limits from top decays and @xmath35 production are 1.5 and 1.3 times larger , respectively .",
    "let us turn now to the possibility of observing these anomalous decays .",
    "the most common criterion to estimate the discovery potential is to use the discovery significance defined as the ratio of the expected signal divided by the expected background fluctuation , @xmath118 .",
    "this is adequate when @xmath119 and the poisson distribution of the background can be approximated by a gaussian with standard deviation @xmath120 .",
    "one has `` evidence '' ( @xmath121 ) when @xmath122 , and `` discovery '' ( @xmath123 ) occurs with @xmath124 .    in a general 2hdm , the most common _ ansatz _ for the fcn couplings is to assume that they scale with the quark masses . under this assumption ,",
    "the expected size of these couplings is @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "an @xmath21 coupling of this size ( leading to @xmath127 ) will easily be detected and precisely measured . in top decays , at run h we have @xmath128 using standard cuts and @xmath129 using the network cut .",
    "the benefit of the ann is clear : the luminosity required to discover a signal is reduced to one half . in @xmath35 production ,",
    "the significance is much smaller , @xmath130 . the minimum coupling which can be discovered with @xmath123 is @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) , and the minimum coupling which can be seen with @xmath121 is @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "an @xmath135 coupling @xmath136 is too small to be seen , because in top decays we have only @xmath137 , and in @xmath35 production @xmath138 .",
    "note that for a 2hdm this _ ansatz _ implies that there are other interesting fcn current processes , for instance @xmath139 at a muon collider @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to consider that the fcn couplings between two quarks are proportional to some ckm mixing angles involving these quarks .",
    "rephasing invariance implies that these couplings are of the form @xmath140 , with @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "choosing @xmath142 , the hierarchy among the mixing angles guarantees a small value for @xmath143 . with @xmath144",
    "we recover the values of @xmath145 and @xmath12 of the previous _ ansatz _ , but @xmath14 is a factor of two larger , @xmath146 .",
    "an htu coupling of this size is now near the detectable level : @xmath147 in top decays and in @xmath148 in @xmath35 production , and if it is enhanced by a factor @xmath15 it would also be detected .    in models with exotic quarks the top fcn",
    "scalar couplings can be large , @xmath149 or @xmath150 ( but not both simultaneously ) .",
    "these are the only models where the top can naturally have a large mixing with the up quark .",
    "however , the effects of top mixing in these models are most clearly seen with the appearance of tree level @xmath17 couplings , leading to top anomalous decays @xmath151 @xcite and @xmath152 production @xcite .",
    "if these processes are not observed at lhc , the @xmath16 couplings ( proportional to the fcn @xmath17 couplings ) must be small , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , below the detectable level .",
    "to analyze the case of top decays @xmath30 in the mssm it is necessary to recalculate the signal and backgrounds and train again the ann with the new data .",
    "the reason is that in the region of parameters of interest the higgs width is much larger due to the enhanced @xmath45 coupling , and the @xmath155 distribution is broader in principle . for consistency we will use the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath156 , a pseudoscalar mass @xmath157 gev and @xmath158 . with these parameters ,",
    "the higgs mass is in the interval @xmath159 gev @xcite .",
    "the kinematics is fairly independent of the particular value of @xmath7 used , as we have shown above , the only difference being the higgs decay rate to @xmath160 which varies slightly in this mass range . for our analysis",
    "we take @xmath161 gev , @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "our limits on @xmath163 are proportional to @xmath164 .",
    "to separate signal from background we select events with network output @xmath165 .",
    "there are large regions in the mssm parameter space where @xmath166 is greater than @xmath167 and even reaches @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "these decays can be discovered at lhc run h with @xmath169 .",
    "also , a rate @xmath170 is observable with @xmath121 .",
    "the decays @xmath171 have a too small rate to be seen .",
    "on the other hand , if no signal is observed we obtain a limit @xmath172 at run l and @xmath173 at run h. note that although these limits seem better than those obtained for @xmath49 , when translated into branching ratios they give very similar bounds , @xmath174 at run l and @xmath175 at run h.    we are indebted to j. guasch for discussions and for providing us with data for the mssm higgs analysis .",
