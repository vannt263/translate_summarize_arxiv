    "during the last few years , a considerable amount of work has been dedicated to the possibility of generating a sizeable baryon asymmetry on the electro - weak phase transition ( see for example @xcite ) . for an excess of baryons to develop in an universe which initially has zero baryon number ,",
    "the already well known following conditions , first enunciated by sakharov , must be met : 1 ) some interaction of elementary particles must violate baryon number .",
    "2 ) c and cp must be violated in order that there is not a perfect equality between rates of @xmath6 processes , since otherwise no asymmetry could evolve from an initially symmetric state .",
    "3 ) a departure from thermal equilibrium must play an essential role , since otherwise cpt would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number .",
    "remarkably , the standard model of weak interactions may provide all these conditions .",
    "in particular the third one can be met if the weak phase transition is at least weakly first order .    in a first order phase transition ,",
    "the conversion from one phase to the other occurs trough nucleation .",
    "this happens when the system is either supercooled or superheated .",
    "bubbles of the  true  phase ( with an expectation value of some higgs field @xmath7 ) expand rapidly absorbing the region of the  false  phase ( @xmath8 ) . at the bubble surface",
    "there is a region or  wall  , in principle of microscopic dimensions , which separates the phases .",
    "the speed regime of the expanding bubble walls is poorly understood in the theory .",
    "after an acceleration period , the final stationary speed of the expanding bubble walls could be anywhere in the range @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "lattice and numerical simulations indicate that @xmath10 can be reached in circumstances of high latent heat and high surface tension which could be achieved in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) for realistic higgs masses @xmath11 . for having even higher wall speed @xmath12 ,",
    "it is necessary some fine tuning ( a extremely low value for the friction parameter , see @xcite ) . at later stages of the bubble evolution",
    "an oscillatory regime with successive periods of expansion and contraction is naturally expected @xcite .",
    "particles in the  false  ( higher temperature ) phase are reflected off the advancing bubble walls , while most particles in the low temperature phase are unable to catch up with the receding walls , and can not equilibrate across the phase boundary . thus one has a departure from equilibrium and a baryon asymmetry can be generated .    in the physical conditions of the early universe",
    "the fermions moving through the bubble wall will interact also with the particles in the surrounding plasma , a full transport problem must be considered .",
    "a useful simplifying assumption is to decompose the process into two steps , one describing the production of the cp asymmetry on the transmission / reflection coefficients when the quarks / antiquarks are scattered on the wall , the second describing the transport and the eventual transformation of the cp asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry via the baryon number anomaly .    assuming that the scattering from the wall is little affected by diffusion corrections , the effects of the surrounding plasma can be partially incorporated by introducing a higgs field effective potential which takes into account finite temperature corrections to the tree - level potential .",
    "the structure and profile of the wall depends on this effective potential on a complicated way .",
    "fermions passing through the domain wall acquire a mass which is proportional to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field , which is determined from the equations of motion of the finite temperature effective action of the bubble .",
    "the problem of computation of transmission coefficients reduces to the solution of a dirac equation with a space dependent mass term .",
    "exact solutions has been obtained only for two simple cases : for a wall profile approximated by a step function @xcite and for an average higgs field profile of the  kink ansatz \" type @xcite(with z , a coordinate perpendicular to the wall ) : @xmath13 where the width of the wall is given essentially by the inverse of the higgs mass : @xmath14    in this ansatz there is not variation of the complex phase of the higgs field through the wall .",
    "it has been examined in @xcite the effect of introducing a small cp - violating imaginary part in eq.([e1001 ] ) as a perturbative effect .",
    "numerical solutions have been obtained for some more complicated profiles which incorporate locally dependent complex phases and which are considered to be ",
    "reasonable  enough although not neccesarily solution of any equation of motion ( for example in @xcite ) .",
    "the object of this work is the computation of transmission coefficients of a fermion in a certain fixed higgs field background with an arbitrary , possibly high , complex phase . with them",
    "we will be able to estimate the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "consider a langrangian for the fermion @xmath15 in the background of a complex scalar with a yukawa coupling .",
    "for the scalar to have a nonzero complex vacuum expectation value , we can assume it is a part of an extended higgs sector such as mssm or a more general two higgs - doublets model . the fermionic part of the lagrangian important to us is @xmath16 with yukawa coupling constant h. @xmath15 acquires a position dependent mass , which , in a appropriate reference frame is a function only of one coordinate , @xmath17 . from @xmath18",
    "the equations of motion are obtained    @xmath19    it is possible to absorb a constant phase in @xmath20 with a redefinition of one of the chiral fields .",
    "one needs only the plane wave solution of the dirac equation for particles moving along the normal to the wall profile ( considered microscopically flat ) . for any other incoming direction ,",
    "the problem can be reduced to the latter performing a lorentz boost . reordering the spinorial components , the dirac operator given by eqs.([e2003 ] ) can be factorized into @xmath21 blocks . for solutions with positive energy e",
    ", we can make the ansatz : @xmath22    where @xmath23 , is the projection onto the x - y plane . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are eigenspinors of the chirality operator , @xmath26 , for the eigenvalue @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 . going through an intermediate lorentz transformation",
    "we obtain finally the two equations @xmath30 with @xmath31    we will deal in this work with the particular case given by the function @xmath32 the constants @xmath33 are real ; @xmath34 ; @xmath35 can be also set to real without loss of generality .",
    "this function represents a linear phase variation with a global difference of @xmath36 over a distance of the order of the wall thickness defined by @xmath37 . in specific models",
    "@xmath1 can be related to the quantity of cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "the position dependent complex phase can be considered as an additional source of effective cp - violating phenomena .",
    "the profile of the wall given by @xmath20 can not be derived from any classical field equations in presence of an effective higgs potential with up to quartic terms as it is usually considered .",
    "it can be trivially seen however that such a wall profile corresponds to an energy density of the wall per unit area of the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 of the same order of magnitude as the energy density of the  kink  ansatz ( [ e2001 ] ) .",
    "some indication can be obtained from the previous formula . as the nucleation temperature @xmath40",
    "( see eq.(13 ) in @xcite ) and according to table ( 1 ) in @xcite which relates nucleation rates and wall speed , a high value for @xmath1 would favor generically a lower value for the wall speed . in this work",
    "we will see ( fig.(6)(c - d ) ) that , for small wall speed , a high value for @xmath1 is equally acceptable as a lower one in order to obtain a reasonable @xmath41 ratio .",
    "it would be possible to solve eqs.([e1102]-[e1101 ] ) with the function given by eq.([e1103 ] ) , reducing them to a bessel - like differential equation .",
    "it is possible and advantageous however to use perturbation theory to compute the evolution operator of the system .",
    "the summation to all orders of the perturbation expansion is possible thanks to the special form of @xmath42 .",
    "there are two main advantages in doing so : the first one is that the procedure is easily generalizable to any number of dimensions ( for example to incorporate mixing between generations ) , the second one is that the evolution operator is computed directly and the reflection coefficients are easily given in terms of its components . a similar technique has been used already in @xcite to compute the neutrino oscillation probabilities in solar matter .    the evolution operator of the differential system ( [ e1102 ] ) is given by the path - ordered integral @xmath43 in this work we are concerned with an operator @xmath44 of the form @xmath45 with @xmath46    @xmath47 real , @xmath48 complex in general .",
    "the real part of @xmath48 is greater than zero .",
    "it will be set @xmath49 without loss of generality .",
    "formally , it is possible to solve eq.([e102 ] ) by successive iterations :    @xmath50    @xmath51 is the well - known integral @xmath52    the domain of integration is defined by @xmath53    following the same arguments as in @xcite one can show that it is enough to compute u in the @xmath54 limit .",
    "the evolution for finite @xmath55 can be deduced from the expression for this limit .",
    "trough elementary manipulations of eq.([e101 ] ) , we get the elements of @xmath51 in a basis of eigenvectors of @xmath56 : @xmath57 with @xmath58 . @xmath59 one of the two eigenvalues of @xmath56 .    due to the dimensionality of the problem and the special form for v , the summatory in eq.([e1107 ] ) either is zero or reduces to only one term depending on whether n is odd or even and on the states @xmath60 . for diagonal terms ( @xmath61 )",
    "the product of @xmath62 is always zero when n is odd .",
    "when n is even there is a single surviving term . for non - diagonal terms ,",
    "the situation is reversed : the only one surviving term appears for n odd .",
    "this single remaining term is always of the alternating form @xmath63 .",
    "so , @xmath64    all the functions appearing in the integral @xmath65 are of exponential type , the following equality @xcite can be applied : @xmath66    in our case the sums in the denominator of eq.([e612 ] ) are of the form    @xmath67    @xmath68 can take only the values @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 is @xmath48 or @xmath71 .",
    "one have for the integers @xmath72 : @xmath73 @xmath74 or @xmath75 ; they are equal or differ in one unit .    for the diagonal terms , @xmath61 , @xmath76 even ( writing @xmath77 ) : @xmath78 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\exp z_0 ( n/2)(s+s^\\ast ) } { ( s+s^\\ast)^{n/2 } \\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right ) !",

    "the special case @xmath95 will be important later . in this case",
    "@xmath93 become dependent only on @xmath35 and have the explicit simple form : @xmath96    to obtain @xmath97 , evolution operator for the eq.([e1101 ] ) , one must make the change @xmath98 .",
    "the matrix become @xmath99 with @xmath100    see appendix a for some new formulas for the absolute values of generalized hypergeometric functions which can be obtained from the general properties of @xmath101 .",
    "following the same reasoning used in @xcite , using the general properties of the evolution operator , the evolution for any finite z is given by the matrix @xmath102 in this work , we will make use only of the infinite @xmath55 limit .",
    "we will follow the same procedure as in @xcite for defining the reflection coefficient . as it can be seen directly from eqs.([e2120],[e2122 ] ) , in the region @xmath103 we have the following asymptotic behavior    @xmath104    in this region , the eigenspinors @xmath105 correspond to , vanishing mass , left - moving particles of opposite chirality and similarly @xmath106 to right moving particles .",
    "for left - moving particles incident from the symmetric phase two components coexist at @xmath103 , the incident particle itself and the reflected one by the domain wall .",
    "we define asymptotic reflection coefficients @xmath107 as @xmath108    the momentum eigenstates for @xmath109 are obtained diagonalizing the constant matrix @xmath110 . the eigenvectors @xmath111 correspond to right moving ( + ) and left moving particles ( - ) with respective eigenvalues .    imposing the boundary condition",
    "that at @xmath109 only a left - moving particle with momentum @xmath112 propagates , the wave function at infinite is : @xmath113    the reflection coefficient r is given explicitly by the expression @xmath114 and similarly for @xmath115 .",
    "we are interested in the asymmetry between the reflection probabilities : @xmath116 . in the ultrarelativistic limit ( @xmath117 ) , @xmath118 . in the limit @xmath119 @xmath120 , both reflection coefficients @xmath121 and the asymmetry @xmath122 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that in the case we had supposed from the beginning a complex constant mass @xmath35 , the quantities @xmath107 would remain independent of the phase of @xmath35 taking into account the formula ( [ e2129 ] ) .    in fig.([f1 ] ) the asymmetry a is plotted as a function of the dimensionless quantity @xmath123 and some fixed values of @xmath1 . for @xmath124 ( plot b )",
    "the results obtained here coincide with the numerical result obtained in @xcite ( fig .",

    "the asymmetry a is non - neglible for a large @xmath129 range . in general a is negligible for fermion masses corresponding to @xmath130 which can be translated to the condition @xmath131 for not so heavy higgs masses .",
    "as the phase difference @xmath36 increases , the height of the peaks keeps roughly unaltered but their position moves : @xmath132    for large differences @xmath133 , @xmath115 becomes neglible and the asymmetry @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath115 is non - neglible only for @xmath129 and @xmath1 small enough , such that the imaginary part of the first parameter of the hypergeometric function in eqs.([e6024 ] ) approaches zero .    for higher values of @xmath1",
    "some resonant effect becomes apparent , the peaks get sharper and the asymmetry is only non - negligible around them .",
    "this is particularly evident in the last plot ( d ) .",
    "this effect could lead to an essentially monochromatic asymmetry in scenarios with highly oscillatory or random phase differences .",
    "for high @xmath1 , the asymmetry quantity can be approximated by the expression @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a delta - like peaked function and @xmath137 , the value of a at peak , is easily computable from eqs.([e1028 ] ) , it is of interest only its general behavior : @xmath138    the resonant behavior is again evident in fig.([f2 ] ) where we plot a as a function of the parameter @xmath1 for various @xmath128 as before .",
    "the peaks in the asymmetry function appear for values such that @xmath139 .",
    "the chiral charge flux in front of the wall in the symmetric phase and in the wall frame is given by @xcite :    @xmath140    a is the asymptotic asymmetry defined in the previous section and the thermal equilibrium fermion flux densities @xmath141 in the symmetric and broken phases respectively ( neglecting fermi blocking factors ) are :    @xmath142    the wall velocity in the fluid frame is given by u ; @xmath143 ; @xmath144 are the longitudinal and transverse momentum of the fermion with respect to the wall .",
    "t is the equilibrium temperature .",
    "the use of asymptotic expressions for @xmath145 and @xmath146 is questionable , the position dependent mass implies the existence of a density gradient even at thermal equilibrium .",
    "the formula ( [ e1037 ] ) would be valid at far distances from the wall and in absence of inter - particle collisions .",
    "we can expect that the formula is reasonable valid as long as the wall width is small compared to the mean free path in the plasma , so effects inside the wall do not play an important role .    defining dimensionless momentum and wall width @xmath147 , defining also @xmath148 and integrating with respect @xmath149",
    ", we arrive to the expression :    @xmath150    where @xmath151 is the function defined by the integral : @xmath152    the dependence with the cp violating phase @xmath1 is fully contained in the asymmetry @xmath153 .",
    "the integrand in eq.([e1043b ] ) is defined positive if @xmath154 . for negative @xmath155 ( as it could happen in late wall contraction phases ) its sign changes at a certain @xmath156 . for large @xmath157 the integrand multiplying a in eq.([e1043b ] ) approaches zero exponentially for any value of the parameters , the most important contribution to the integral comes from the values of @xmath158 with @xmath157 relatively small .",
    "this implies that in the case @xmath151 might become negative , its absolute value would be relatively small .",
    "it is expected that the resonance observed in the previous section tends to be washed out due to this behavior : the resonance in a appears at large x , just when the rest of the integrand is exponentially smaller .",
    "the resonance in a could have a more significant effect in non - equilibrium cases : for flux densities @xmath141 with large tails at large momentum .",
    "we plot in fig.([f3 ] ) the chiral flux divided by the cubic temperature given by the eqs.([e1042]-[e1043b ] ) as a function of u. @xmath159 is rather independent of u and @xmath1 in the logarithmic scale of the figure , except for @xmath160 .",

    "although interesting qualitatively , it is clear from a numerical point of view that the maximum variation , a factor 4 from @xmath203 to @xmath204 , is still small in comparison with all the other incertitudes appearing in the present knowledge , observational and theoretical , of @xmath3 . an important conclusion from fig.([f6 ] ) is that , although decreasing , @xmath3 still keeps the right order of magnitude even for very large @xmath1 .",
    "as conclusion , we were able to solve the dirac equation with a space dependent complex mass term which , although not a solution of the equations of motion , reproduces the expected variation in module and in complex phase of the average higgs field across the wall . from the solution of the dirac equation the particle - antiparticle transmission asymmetry is computed .",

    "the resulting baryon asymmetry for contracting walls has been estimated for the first time to our knowledge .",
    "the main uncertainties come from the rate of anomalous baryon number violation at high temperature and from the method itself . in view of the dependence on @xmath198 and @xmath1 ,",
    "it is clear that the plausibility of this model depends only on the existence of a massive fermion ( as the top quark ) and is rather independent of the values of the higgs mass and the critical temperature of the weak transition as long as they keep in a reasonable range .",
