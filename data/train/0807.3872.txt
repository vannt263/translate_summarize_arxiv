    "gravitational lensing is a well - established research subject treating the bending of light trajectories by gravitational fields .",
    "its methodology is traditionally developed within the weak field approximation of general relativity , which describes photon trajectories through the geodesics equation . in this context , the true position of a source in the sky and its apparent position after deflection of the light by a massive body are related by the so - called lens equation @xcite ( for textbook reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "this relation and its mathematical properties have been extensively studied for generic lens models and represents the basis of the whole gravitational lensing theory .",
    "the lens equation is typically established in the small angle approximation , in conjunction with the weak deflection hypothesis . in more recent years",
    ", there has been a renewed interest in astrophysical situations in which the deflection angle is not small .",
    "for example , if the bending of light emitted by sources near a black hole is considered , the deflection angle may reach arbitrary large values @xcite .",
    "for such gravitational lenses the old small angles lens equation must be obviously revised .",
    "several proposals for generalized lens equations have then appeared in the literature and have been applied to specific cases @xcite .",
    "such lens equations principally differ among each other for what concerns the variables in which they are expressed .",
    "however they also lie at different approximation levels below the full general relativistic description of the photon motion .    in this work ,",
    "we review all these lens equations for spherically symmetric bodies appeared in the literature and introduce a new lens equation that fills a gap in the present taxonomy .",
    "we also present a detailed discussion of the order of magnitude of the errors committed in the use of different lens equations , giving a complete interpretation for their origin .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a critical review of the approximations leading to the weak deflection lens equation has recently appeared @xcite .",
    "the present work shares the same spirit by testing different approximations leading to large deflection lens equations , instead .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we establish the notations by describing the basic geometric configuration for gravitational lensing . in section iii , we review the exact lens equation by frittelli , kling and newman , derived in a fully general relativistic context . in section iv , we discuss the asymptotic approximation and all lens equations making use of this approximation .",
    "we also introduce our new proposal for an improved lens equation . in section v we present a numerical example about a realistic gravitational lensing situation , in order to compare the different approximations in the lens equations previously discussed .",
    "section vi contains a discussion about the precision needed in gravitational lensing observations and the conclusions of the work .",
    "let us consider a spherically symmetric spacetime , whose metric is @xmath0    let us put a static source at radial coordinate @xmath1 and a static observer at radial coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "the orientation of the polar coordinates is chosen in such a way that both the source and the observer lie on the equatorial plane @xmath3 . as a consequence of the spherical symmetry",
    ", the whole photon motion takes place on this plane .",
    "we also assume that the metric is asymptotically flat , so that the coordinates @xmath4 become minkowski polar coordinates very far from the center ( we neglect any effects due to cosmological expansion in our discussion ) .",
    "a very useful structure for understanding several lens equations proposed in the literature is the minkowski space associated with ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "this structure can be introduced by assuming that the metric depends on one or more parameters continuously so that , once we tune these parameters to zero , the metric becomes minkowski and the coordinates @xmath4 become minkowski polar coordinates on the whole spacetime .",
    "the parameters of the metric may be the mass of the lens , the electric charge , the scalar charge or any other parameter dictated by any kind of gravitational theory .",
    "many definitions need to be given by referring to this associated minkowski space obtained by tuning all these parameters to zero . of course",
    ", the original curved spacetime and the associated minkowski space coincide in the asymptotically flat region .",
    "a typical geometric configuration of gravitational lensing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , with a photon emitted by a source @xmath5 , curved by the gravitational field generated by the lens @xmath6 and detected by the observer in @xmath7 .",
    "the observer sees the photon at an angle @xmath8 with respect to the optical axis @xmath9 , whereas , if there were no lens , he would directly observe the source at an angle @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath10 is thus the first quantity that is well - defined only in the associated minkowski space , as we must tune the mass of the lens to zero to define it .",
    "the emission direction of the photon is @xmath11 , whereas the detection direction is @xmath12 . in the associated minkowski space",
    ", we can also measure the angle between these two directions and define it as the deflection angle @xmath13 ( we can not compare directions from different points in a curved space ) .",
    "it is common practice to define the lens plane and the source plane as those planes orthogonal to the optical axis passing through the lens and the source , respectively .",
    "of course , also these definitions can be given in the associated minkowski space and then extended to the original curved space .",
    "then , one can define the distances from the observer to the lens plane as @xmath14 , the distance between the lens plane and the source plane as @xmath15 and the distance between the observer and the source plane as @xmath16 .",
    "the usual relation @xmath17 holds .",
    "these distances between planes are obviously different from the distances between the points @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have already defined @xmath2 and @xmath1 as the radial coordinates of observer and source in the original curved metric .",
    "once we report these coordinates in the associated minkowski space , they coincide with the proper distances of the observer and the source from the lens .",
    "then , in this space , we can establish simple geometrical relations with the distances between planes .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath18    of course , if the source is very close to the optical axis , @xmath10 and @xmath19 are small and the differences between the uppercase distances and the lowercase distances is of second order in the angles . therefore , in the classical weak deflection paradigm ,",
    "the two notions are confused without consequences . here",
    ", we must keep them distinct in order to avoid confusion .",
    "the lens equation is a relation among the source and observer coordinates and the angle @xmath8 at which the observer detects an image of the source @xmath5 .",
    "remaining in a fully general relativistic context , it is possible to write down the exact equations governing the photon motion and consequently write an exact lens equation .",
    "this approach has been proposed by frittelli and newman in ref .",
    "@xcite and then applied to the schwarzschild lens in ref .",
    "later on , it has been generalized to all spherically symmetric spacetimes in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a photon emitted from a source , deflected by the lens and detected by the observer experiences a change in the azimuthal coordinate given by @xmath20 \\frac{\\sqrt{b(r)}j}{c(r)\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a(r)}-\\frac{j^2}{c(r)}}}dr , \\label{phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the specific angular momentum of the photon , which is a constant of motion , and @xmath22 is the distance of closest approach to the lens .",
    "these two quantities are related by @xmath23    the specific angular momentum is also related to the angle @xmath8 at which the observer detects the photon . defining the angle by using the scalar product between the arrival direction and the direction specified by the optical axis @xmath24",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , we find @xmath25    if the observer is very far from the lens , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , so that one recovers the relation @xmath28 which allows to identify @xmath21 with the impact parameter @xmath29 of the light ray trajectory ( except for a speed of light factor ) . in general , however , this identification is only approximate ( see next section ) .",
    "the exact lens equation can finally be written by noting that the change in the azimuthal coordinate must be equal to the difference between the azimuthal coordinates of the observer and the source . replacing all occurrences of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in terms of @xmath8 by eqs .",
    "( [ jr0 ] ) and ( [ thetaj ] ) , we get @xcite @xmath30    this equation is the exact general relativistic relation between the angle at which the image appears in the observer s sky and the relative positions of source , observer and lens .",
    "all other lens equations represent approximate forms of this equation .",
    "of course , most lens equations are derived under assumptions that are largely satisfied in realistic situations .",
    "therefore , their simplifications are absolutely welcome , if the induced errors are below observational sensitivity or other sources of noise . in the following sections we will introduce some lens equations , describing their approximations .",
    "the most popular approximation is what can be called as asymptotic approximation , which amounts to saying that the source and the observer are in the asymptotic flat region of the spacetime .",
    "quantitatively , this is expressed by requiring @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the gravitational radius of the lens , i.e. the typical scale in the curved spacetime metric controlling the range of the gravitational field ( it is @xmath33 in the schwarzschild metric ) . as a first consequence , eq .",
    "( [ thetajapp ] ) holds , so that the angular momentum of the photon @xmath21 can be identified with the impact parameter @xmath34 of the initial trajectory and the impact parameter @xmath29 of the final trajectory , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig ] . as a second consequence",
    ", the deflection angle can be calculated as @xmath35 which is the azimuthal shift of a photon incoming from infinity with impact parameter @xmath21 and escaping to infinity .    once this approximation is accepted , it is possible to establish a relation among @xmath8 and the relative positions of source , lens and observer using pure euclidean geometry .",
    "in fact , all distances are defined in the asymptotic spacetime and the only input from general relativity is the precise expression of the deflection angle as a function of the impact parameter @xmath29 .",
    "note that the asymptotic approximation does not necessary imply the small angle approximation .",
    "in fact , it just assumes that the source and the observer distances are much larger than the gravitational radius of the lens .",
    "this does not prevent the impact parameter to be very large .    in the following subsections",
    ", we will introduce several approximate lens equations appeared in the literature , expressed in terms of different quantities .",
    "the first lens equation we introduce is due to ohanian @xcite , who proposed it in a study of gravitational lensing by a schwarzschild black hole for arbitrary deflection angles .",
    "thanks to the asymptotic approximation , we can use euclidean geometry to relate the various quantities and store all the relativistic input in the angle @xmath13 .",
    "let us define the angle @xmath36 .",
    "considering the triangles @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we can write down the relations @xmath39 summing up these two equalities , we obtain @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath40    the angle @xmath41 can be expressed in terms of @xmath8 recalling that the impact parameter of the incoming trajectory @xmath34 is equal to the impact parameter of the outgoing trajectory @xmath29 ( in the asymptotic approximation )",
    ". therefore @xmath42 once eq .",
    "( [ bartheta ] ) is used in eq .",
    "[ lensoha ] , we obtain the lens equation as a relation involving the detection angle @xmath8 , the distance between the observer and the lens @xmath2 , the distance of the lens to the source @xmath1 , the source position angle @xmath19 and the deflection angle @xmath13 , which is a function of @xmath8 through @xmath43 .    the original form proposed by ohanian @xcite",
    "was actually written by replacing @xmath8 and @xmath41 by their small angle approximations @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "this is an additional approximation , with respect to the asymptotic approximation , which we will not consider here .",
    "another very simple expression for the lens equation was proposed by virbhadra , narasimha and chitre ( vnc ) in a paper studying the role of the scalar field in gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "it is just the result of the sine theorem applied to the triangle @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the distance between the source @xmath5 and the intersection point @xmath49 between the incoming and outgoing trajectories .",
    "( [ lensvnc ] ) is valid for arbitrary deflections and impact parameters . as for the ohanian lens equation",
    ", its only approximation with respect to the exact lens equation ( [ lensfkn ] ) is the asymptotic approximation , which is necessary to express the deflection angle @xmath13 .",
    "however , the lens equation ( [ lensvnc ] ) is not a closed relation among the detection angle @xmath8 and the relative positions of observer , lens and source .",
    "in fact , it is expressed in terms of the position of point @xmath49 , which is unknown a priori and needs to be estimated in some way .",
    "one possibility is to approximate @xmath48 by @xmath1 , which is reasonable if the source is at distances much larger than the impact parameter .",
    "however , this additional approximation would spoil the effectiveness of the lens equation in its original form .",
    "therefore , the vnc lens equation is difficult to use in practical applications , since it demands an independent knowledge or at least an estimate of the position of the point @xmath49 .      with their outbreaking paper about the possibility of observing higher order images around the black hole at the center of our galaxy @xcite , virbhadra and ellis",
    "have attracted a great attention on gravitational lensing beyond the weak deflection approximation , inspiring new vitality in black hole gravitational lensing .",
    "they have also proposed a new lens equation that has become very popular in the scientific literature .",
    "their equation is written in terms of the distances between source , lens and observer planes .",

    "the proposal by virbhadra and ellis is to assume that @xmath49 lies on the lens plane , so that @xmath54",

    "we will discuss the error introduced by this approximation in section [ sec num ] , while in section [ sec boz ] we will present an improvement of this equation which avoids this approximation and makes it equivalent to the ohanian lens equation .      in a paper studying gravitational lensing by boson stars",
    "@xcite , dabrwoski and schunck realized the difficulties of using the vnc lens equation ( [ lensvnc ] ) and derived the alternative lens equation    @xmath56 \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left[\\tan\\theta+\\tan(\\alpha-\\theta ) \\right ] .",
    "\\label{lensds}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this can be obtained from the virbhadra and ellis lens equation ( [ lensve ] ) replacing the distances between planes @xmath16 and @xmath15 by the distances between objects using eqs .",
    "( [ dd1 ] ) and ( [ dd2 ] ) and noting that @xmath57 in the associated minkowski space .    in practice , the equation ( [ lensds ] ) by dabrwoski and schunck is the same as eq .",
    "( [ lensve ] ) by virbhadra and ellis but expressed in terms of distances between objects instead of distances between planes .",
    "of course , like the former equation , it contains the additional approximation that @xmath49 lies on the lens plane .",
    "the ohanian lens equation ( [ lensoha ] ) has the advantage of being very simple and being the closest relative of the exact lens equation , since it only contains the asymptotic approximation and makes no additional assumptions . however , in several astrophysical applications one may prefer to have a lens equation directly written in terms of the angle @xmath10 rather than @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , @xmath10 is an angle with vertex in the observer and thus directly connected to coordinates in the observer s sky , whereas @xmath19 is an angle with vertex in the lens , thus being less close to observables .",
    "the relation between the two angles is given by eq .",
    "( [ gammabeta ] ) . therefore ,",
    "if we take the sine of equation ( [ lensoha ] ) , using eq .",
    "( [ bartheta ] ) and re - ordering terms we get @xmath58 which first appeared in ref . @xcite .",
    "though being more complicated than eq .",
    "( [ lensoha ] ) , this lens equation has the advantage of being directly expressed in terms of the angle @xmath10 and thus preferable for applications in which this angle is directly involved .",
    "otherwise , it is completely equivalent to the ohanian lens equation .",
    "note that the distances involved in this equation are distances between the objects and not between their geometrical planes , as in the lens equations of sections [ sec ve ] and [ sec boz ] .",
    "one may note that this lens equation is expressed in terms of the same variables appearing in the equation by dabrwoski and schunck ( [ lensds ] ) .",
    "however the two equations look different . apart from the ordering of the terms , eq .",
    "( [ lensds ] ) contains the additional approximation that @xmath49 lies on the lens plane , whereas eq .",
    "( [ lensbs ] ) does not .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ lensbs ] ) represents an improved version of eq .",
    "( [ lensds ] ) .",
    "the same difference will arise in the new equation to be presented in the next section and the equation by virbhadra and ellis .",
    "( [ lensve ] ) represents a very useful lens equation expressed in terms of distances between the observer , lens and source planes .",
    "as we have explained in section [ sec ve ] , it is derived under the additional assumption that the intersection point @xmath49 between the incoming and outgoing ray trajectories lies on the lens plane .",
    "it would be desirable to have a lens equation expressed in terms of the same quantities without this additional assumption .",
    "starting again from the ohanian lens equation ( [ lensoha ] ) , we can solve it in terms of @xmath41 and plug it in eq .",
    "( [ bartheta ] ) .",
    "recalling eq .",
    "( [ dd1 ] ) and the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath10 ( [ gammabeta ] ) , we can put the lens equation in the form @xmath59 which represents the improved version of eq .",
    "( [ lensve ] ) by virbhadra and ellis , in the same sense as eq .",
    "( [ lensbs ] ) by bozza and sereno represents the improved version of eq .",
    "( [ lensds ] ) by dabrowski and schunck . in section v we make a thorough discussion and comparison of the two equations .",
    "we finally recall the classical lens equation obtained in the hypothesis of small angles @xmath60 .",
    "this hypothesis has nothing to do with the weak deflection approximation , since the deflection angle is typically expressed in powers of @xmath61 , whereas the corrections to the small angles approximation are expressed in powers of @xmath62 .",
    "so it makes sense to consider an exact deflection angle while performing the small angles approximation in all trigonometric functions .",
    "the small angles lens equation can be obtained from any of the equations ( [ lensve ] ) , ( [ lensds ] ) , ( [ lensbs ] ) or ( [ lenseq ] ) .",
    "the well - known result @xcite is @xmath63    the small angles approximation is the most rude approximation that can be done on the lens equation . nevertheless , it is a useful reference approximate equation lying on the other extremum of the approximation ladder with respect to the exact lens equation ( [ lensfkn ] ) , with all other lens equations staying in the middle steps between the two equations .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar equation can be deduced when the deflection angle is very close to multiples of @xmath64 .",
    "this case corresponds to higher order images generated by photons performing one or more loops around the lens before emerging .",
    "the only difference is that the deflection angle @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ lenssa ] ) must be replaced by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of loops .      to summarize this section",
    ", we can say that the asymptotic approximation allows the use of the relations of euclidean geometry , confining general relativity to the derivation of the precise expression of the deflection angle in terms of the impact parameter .    in order to write the lens equation in terms of @xmath8 , @xmath13 and the relative positions of observer , source and lens",
    ", an additional relation is needed between the incoming and the outgoing branches of the photon trajectory .",
    "the lens equation by ohanian ( [ lensoha ] ) , and the related equations ( [ lensbs ] ) by bozza and sereno and ( [ lenseq ] ) presented in this paper , use the equality of the impact parameters of the incoming and outgoing trajectories , expressed by eq .",
    "( [ bartheta ] ) .",
    "this equality descends from the time - reversal symmetry of the photon geodesic in general relativity along with the asymptotic approximation .",
    "on the other hand , the lens equations by virbhadra and ellis ( [ lensve ] ) and dabrowski and schunck ( [ lensds ] ) use an alternative relation between the incoming and outgoing trajectories by imposing that the intersection point @xmath49 lies on the lens plane . in the next section we will quantify the accuracy of these lens equations in a realistic astrophysical situation .",
    "as explained in the previous section , in the treatment of gravitational lensing by spherically symmetric lenses with arbitrary deflection angles , we can distinguish an exact lens equation ( [ lensfkn ] ) , a family of lens equations with the asymptotic approximation only ( [ lensoha ] ) , ( [ lensbs ] ) and ( [ lenseq ] ) , and a family of lens equations with the additional geometrical approximation that the intersection point @xmath49 lies on the lens plane ( [ lensve ] ) and ( [ lensds ] ) . for simplicity , we shall refer to these two families of approximate lens equations as the ohanian family and the virbhadra and ellis family , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we have the small angles lens equation , in which all trigonometric functions are approximated by their first order expansions . finally , we can also consider the effect of the weak deflection approximation on the deflection angle , by retaining only the lowest order term in the weak deflection expansion .",
    "we will not consider here the vnc lens equation ( [ lensvnc ] ) since it is not expressed in terms of the relative configuration of source , lens and observer but demands additional information on the position of point @xmath49 .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the best candidate for the observation of gravitational lensing in the regime of large deflections is the black hole at the center of our galaxy , named sgr a*. its mass is estimated to @xmath67 @xmath68 and its distance is @xmath69 kpc @xcite .",
    "the schwarzschild radius is therefore @xmath70    in order to test the accuracy of the different lens equations , we consider the source plane to be at distance @xmath71 from the black hole . at this distance ,",
    "the source is just at the margin of the accretion disk of the black hole , so it may be a star spiralling towards the black hole ( the star s2 is known to reach a distance of 1700@xmath32 at its periapse @xcite ) or a bright spot of hot material rotating around the black hole .",
    "apart from the physical meaning of a source at such distance , this choice has been made with the aim of putting in better numerical evidence the differences in the performances of the lens equations , since the expected order of magnitude of the errors scales with powers of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we are going to study the position of the images as a function of the position of the source , keeping the distance to the source plane @xmath16 fixed .",
    "therefore , we will compare the results of the exact lens equation ( [ lensfkn ] ) with the results of the virbhadra and ellis ( ve ) lens equation ( [ lensve ] ) , the improved lens equation ( [ lenseq ] ) , which is equivalent to ohanian lens equation ( we shall refer to it as the ob lens equation ) , and the small angles lens equation ( [ lenssa ] ) . the last three equations are already expressed in terms of @xmath10 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whereas the exact lens equation ( [ lensfkn ] ) is expressed in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath1 .",

    ", we obtain some terms that reproduce the power expansions of the geometrical terms @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which are explicitly present in the ohanian lens equation ( [ lensoha ] ) and finally , the first term that is not present in the ohanian lens equation is @xmath106 . \\label{asym}\\ ] ]    taking this term to the right hand side of the ohanian lens equation , we can interpret it as an effective change in @xmath19 .",
    "then we can estimate the corresponding change in @xmath8 simply by @xmath107    evaluating the derivative of @xmath8 numerically , and taking for @xmath108 the expression in eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) , we exactly reproduce the error @xmath109 in the ob lens equation , as can be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ fig int ] . in this figure",
    "we have also shown the ve error , already presented in fig .",
    "[ fig eps ] , together with the error deriving from the approximation that @xmath49 lies on the lens plane .",
    "this error can be simply calculated by taking the differences of the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ lensve ] ) and ( [ lenseq ] ) @xmath110.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can explicitly see that the error due to the approximation that @xmath49 lies on the lens plane dominates the error due to the asymptotic approximation in the calculation of the secondary image ( @xmath101 ) and for the primary image up to moderately large @xmath10 . for @xmath111 , the error due to",
    "the asymptotic approximation becomes more relevant than the error due to the position of the intersection point .",
    "however , as already mentioned before , the last regime is the least important for gravitational lensing .",
    "the error induced by the small angles approximation can be obtained by considering the next - to - leading order in the power expansions of the trigonometric functions present in eq .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) .",
    "it amounts to @xmath112    to conclude this subsection , it is interesting to give approximate estimates of the order of magnitude of the errors in terms of the geometric distances involved in the problem in different limits .",
    "for example , we can consider the two limits @xmath111 ( primary image ) and @xmath113 ( secondary image ) .",
    "in the first case we have @xmath80 , in the second case @xmath114 from the weak deflection approximation .",
    "taking also @xmath115 , we have the simple estimates @xmath116 which reproduce the curves in figs .",
    "[ fig eps ] and [ fig int ] fairly well outside the lensing zone and are useful to realize the order of magnitude of the errors .",
    "in particular , we can appreciate that the error due to the position of the intersection point has opposite sign with respect to the others .",
    "finally , a very interesting limit is the case @xmath85 , corresponding to a source perfectly aligned with the black hole and the two images merged into an einstein ring of radius @xmath8 .",
    "the errors in the estimate of the radius of the einstein ring are @xmath117 where the error due to the weak deflection approximation comes from the first term neglected in the weak deflection expansion ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these relations are very useful to understand the accuracy of the various lens equations in the most interesting regime , that is when the gravitational lensing images are most prominent and eventually form an einstein ring .",
    "the weak deflection lens equation has an error of the order @xmath118 . in the case under examination",
    ", this would translate into an error of 6.6 @xmath84as in the radius of the einstein ring , which is @xmath86 @xmath84as in the situation imagined in this calculation .",
    "the small angles lens equation employed with the exact deflection angle has an error of order @xmath119 , which would amount to 0.07 @xmath84as .",
    "the ve lens equation has an error of the same order of magnitude , but with a slightly larger numerical coefficient , thus leading to an error of 0.2 @xmath84as .",
    "finally , the ob lens equation has an error of order @xmath120 , which amounts to @xmath121 @xmath84as .",
    "an analysis similar to section [ sec prisec ] can be repeated for the higher order images , whose position and magnification has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the black hole in the center of our galaxy , and then revisited in many papers with different methods . the first pair of higher order images can be found in the interval @xmath122 , corresponding to photons performing one loop before reaching an observer on the other side of the lens with respect to the source .",
    "since these images appear very close to the shadow border @xmath81 , we think it is more instructive to discuss the fractional displacement of the image from the shadow border , defined as @xmath123 this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig hig ] for the geometric configuration examined in this paper .",
    "the plot has been calculated using the exact lens equation ( [ lensfkn ] ) . for @xmath124",
    "the curve represents the fractional displacement of the positive parity image on the same side of the source and for @xmath101 the curve represents the fractional displacement of the negative parity image on the opposite side . for @xmath85",
    ", we obtain the displacement of the first order einstein ring @xmath125 from the shadow border .    in order to compare the performances of the different lens equations , in fig .",
    "[ fig higdelta ] we plot the relative error in this fractional displacement with respect to the exact lens equation @xmath126 the sa lens equation , in this case , is eq .",
    "( [ lenssa ] ) with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath127 , as explained in section [ sec sa ] .",
    "again we see that the ob lens equation has much lower errors in the estimate of the position of the images than any other lens equations .",
    "the ve lens equation performs slightly better than the small angles equation for @xmath128 , whereas the opposite occurs in the good alignment regime @xmath129 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a value for @xmath10 such that @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in this particular point , all lens equations are equivalent and are affected by the same small error , determined by the asymptotic approximation .    similarly to the case of the primary and secondary images , we can make analytical estimates of the errors in the positions of the higher order images .",
    "we follow the same procedure described in the previous subsection and use the analytical approximation @xmath132 derived in the strong deflection limit @xcite , in order to have fully analytical results . then",
    ", the errors in the displacement of the first order einstein ring are @xmath133    again the error in the ve lens equation is of the same order as the error in the small angles lens equation with a slightly larger numerical coefficient .      in the previous subsections",
    "we have compared the images obtained by solving different lens equations .",
    "the relative error has proved to be quite small , particularly for the ob lens equation , whose error goes down to @xmath134 in some plots . in order to investigate such tiny differences",
    ", we must push the numerical precision of our calculations sufficiently far .    the crucial step in the computations",
    "is represented by the evaluation of the integral ( [ phi ] ) , which contains an integrable singularity at @xmath22 .",
    "we have used the nintegrate routine by mathematica with the default method ( adaptive gaussian quadratures with error estimation based on kronrod points @xcite ) . in order to reduce the errors ,",
    "we have worked with the variable @xmath135 , defined by @xmath136 @xmath135 ranges from 0 to 1 as @xmath137 ranges from @xmath22 to @xmath138 . in the schwarzschild metric , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) expressed in terms of @xmath135 becomes @xmath139    we have checked that increasing the precision goal and the working precision makes the numerical results converge to an asymptotic limit , with a controllable precision ( we have reached a @xmath140 precision ) .",
    "furthermore , we have also re - written the integral as an ordinary differential equation to be solved by the ndsolve routine , which switches between a non - stiff adams method and a stiff gear backward differentiation formula method . solving the differential equation",
    ", we get the primitive function , which can be evaluated at both ends of the domain . in this way",
    ", we have double - checked our results obtained by nintegrate finding that the two methods converge to the same result . in particular",
    ", we find that the differential equation method converges more slowly than the numerical integration with the gaussian quadratures , as the precision goal is increased .",
    "for this reason we tend to give a preference to the nintegrate routine .",
    "the results presented in the plots are calculated with a @xmath141 precision .    the accuracy in the numerical calculation is finally confirmed by the very good agreement with the analytical estimates for the errors at leading order .",
    "of course , an approximation can be valid or not depending on the precision of the observational instrumentation , the level of environmental noise and the accuracy needed for the extraction of the interesting information .",
    "the best resolution we can expect to reach in a reasonably near future is that of the maxim project ( http://maxim.gsfc.nasa.gov ) , which amounts to a fraction of @xmath84as .",
    "then , in the example considered in this section , the weak deflection lens equation would not be able to ensure such a precision .",
    "the ve and the small angles lens equations would be marginally adequate , whereas the ohanian lens equation would be largely sufficient , without need to resort to the exact lens equation .",
    "so , in order to exploit the resolution of future instruments , it might be necessary to use the ohanian lens equation or one of its variants .",
    "environmental noise can be provided by scattering and absorption processes affecting the photons involved in gravitational lensing .",
    "such processes should be very effective in the environment of the supermassive black hole at the galactic center .",
    "however , they act in a statistical way and a good average process should be able to restore the original information regarding gravitational lensing .",
    "more subtle are the effects that introduce unwanted systematics , such as gravitational lensing by secondary objects .",
    "however , the gravitational lensing optical depth towards the center of the bulge is of the order @xmath142 @xcite , which indicates that lensing or microlensing effects by stars or other compact objects on the line of sight is absolutely negligible ( see also @xcite ) . in the absence of relevant systematics ,",
    "the position of the centroids of the images can be used for a clean reconstruction of the gravitational lensing event at the angular resolution level reached by the instruments .",
    "finally , we note that there are many theoretical reasons to require a reconstruction of a gravitational lensing event as precise as possible .",
    "as anticipated , the study of higher order terms in the deflection angle requires a precision better than @xmath118 at second ppn order and @xmath119 at third ppn order .",
    "therefore , if one wants to compare the results of ppn formalism with different black hole metrics , it is mandatory to use a lens equation that guarantees the necessary accuracy . in this respect",
    "the ve lens equation does not represent an improvement with respect to the small angles approximation , as it is affected by an error of the same order of magnitude .    in this work",
    "we have compared the level of accuracy of several lens equations , keeping the exact general relativistic lens equation introduced by frittelli , kling and newman @xcite as the reference equation .",
    "we have shown that the ohanian lens equation @xcite and its close relatives @xcite are the best approximations of the exact lens equation , in that they adopt the asymptotic approximation only .",
    "other lens equations are not expressed in terms of relative positions of source , lens and observer @xcite or introduce additional approximations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have presented a new formulation of the ohanian lens equation in terms of the distances between the observer , lens and source planes , which fills a gap in the lens equation zoo . as shown by a numerical example describing a realistic gravitational lensing event by the black hole at the center of our galaxy , such an equation represents a noteworthy improvement with respect to previous commonly used lens equations expressed in terms of the same quantities .",
