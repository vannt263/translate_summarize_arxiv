    "in a recent paper  @xcite , geometric probability techniques were developed to calculate the probability density functions ( pdfs ) which describe the probability density of finding a distance @xmath3 separating two points distributed in a uniform @xmath4-dimensional sphere and in a uniform ellipsoid .",
    "our focus in the present paper will be on the probability density functions @xmath0 for an @xmath1-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath2 characterized by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the corresponding cartesian coordinates .",

    "@xcite to the case of an arbitrarily non - uniform density distribution by using our method . as an application of these results we will consider the neutrino - exchange contribution to the self - energy of a neutron star modeled as series of concentric shells of different constant density .",
    "other applications will also be discussed .    in this paper",
    "we present a new technique for obtaining the analytical probability density function @xmath0 for a sphere of @xmath1 dimensions having an arbitrary density distribution . to illustrate this technique ,",
    "we begin by deriving the pdf , @xmath0 , for an @xmath1-dimensional uniform sphere of radius @xmath2 , and compare our results to those obtained earlier by other means  @xcite .",
    "we then extend this technique to an @xmath1-dimensional sphere with a non - uniform but spherically symmetric density distribution .",
    "we explicitly evaluate the analytical probability density functions for certain specific density distributions , and then use numerical monte carlo simulations to verify the analytical results .",
    "finally our formalism is generalized to an @xmath1-dimensional sphere with an arbitrary density distribution , and leads to a general - purpose master formula .",
    "this formula allows one to evaluate the pdf for a sphere in @xmath1 dimensions with an arbitrary density distribution . after verifying that the master formula reproduces the results for uniform and spherically symmetric density distributions , we analytically evaluate the probability density functions , for 2 , 3 , and 4-dimensional spheres having non - uniform density distributions .",

    "in this section we illustrate our formalism by deriving the pdf for a circle of radius @xmath2 having a spatially uniform density distribution characterized by @xmath12 constant . for two points randomly sampled inside the circle located at @xmath13 and @xmath14 measured from the center , define @xmath15 and @xmath16 . to simplify the discussion , we translate the center of the circle to the origin so that the equation for the circle is @xmath17 .",

    "<S> a new formalism is presented for analytically obtaining the probability density function , @xmath0 , for the distance between two random points in an @xmath1-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism allows @xmath0 to be calculated for a sphere having an arbitrary density distribution , and reproduces the well - known results for the case of a sphere with uniform density . </S>",
    "<S> the results find applications in stochastic geometry , probability distribution theory , astrophysics , nuclear physics , and elementary particle physics . </S>"
