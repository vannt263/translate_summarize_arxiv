    "one of the most important processes in living cells is the _ translation _ in which the ribosome catalyses the synthesis of proteins from aminoacyl transfer rna ( trna ) , using messenger rna ( mrna ) as the template . in the `` initiation '' state ,",
    "the two subunits of the ribosome join together near the 5 end of the mrna . following this state",
    ", the ribosome slides along the mrna and translates its genetic information into an amino acid chain . in this process the transfer rnas ( trnas ) have been used as adaptors for adding a right amino acid to the end of the polypeptide chain .",
    "the `` elongation '' process is followed by the `` termination '' state at the stop codon , where the ribosome finishes the protein synthesizes and the two ribosomal subunits separate @xcite .",
    "crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy experiments have revealed the structure of the ribosome in the atomistic level @xcite .",
    "the mrna lies in the cleft of the small ribosomal subunit in such a way that its codons may interact with the anticodons of trna in three distinct binding sites , called the `` a '' , `` p '' and `` e '' sites . at the a - site",
    "an incoming trna that carrying the next amino acid , binds to the associated codon in mrna .",
    "the polypeptide chain is attached to the trna , which is located at the p - site .",
    "the deacylated trna leaves the ribosome at the exit or `` e '' site .",
    "we are investigating the generation of force during translocation with high - resolution optical traps .",
    "additionally , we are also interested in how the ribosome uses force to overcome translational barriers such as secondary structure .    since the ribosome is a huge complex catalytic machine with about 50 ribosomal proteins and several rnas and",
    "also has several degrees of motional freedom , it is very difficult to monitor the translation process in experiments .",
    "however the possible mechanisms for ribosomal translocation have been developed in the recent years , taking different approaches that include molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and stochastic models @xcite .",
    "in addition the overall sliding of the ribosome along the rna have been examined using the normal mode analysis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the optical tweezers techniques , now it is possible to study the force generation during the translation process , and the effect of the barriers like secondary structure of mrna on ribosome translocation @xcite .",
    "it is still a question how the chemical catalysis in the ribosome is coupled to its mechanical translocation .",
    "there are two basic schemes @xcite : the brownian ratchet ( br ) and the power stroke ( ps ) mechanisms .",
    "the problem would be more complex when the ribosome encounters to a pseudo - knot of a folded rna .",
    "there is another important question regarding the mechanism of unwrapping of the rna double stranded region .",
    "the recent experiments study the ribosomal translocation through a hairpin structure of a mrna .",
    "the results suggest that the hairpin can be unwound due to either the thermal fluctuations or the pushing past by the ribosome @xcite .",
    "to address to mentioned questions , we attempt to propose a stochastic model to account for some observations for the movement of the ribosome on mrna . according to the experimental observation , the elongation cycle of the ribosomal translation consists of many steps ( more than 10 steps , see appendix a for details ) @xcite .",
    "for the first step it is a good idea to reduce its complexity as much as possible and express its activity in a few main states for further investigations .",
    "the result of our simplification is shown in the schematic picture of a ribosome with its subunits and the mentioned sites in fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic - ribosome ] .",
    "we describe the translation process with six key steps according to the recent experimental data ( reviewed in @xcite ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - model ] .",
    "at the beginning of the elongation cycle , `` state 0 '' , the a site is empty .",
    "the aa - trnas can bind to the vacant site a with a rate of @xmath0 .",
    "this bound aa - trna is in a turnery complex with an elongation factor ef - tu and a gtp .",
    "if the bound aa - trna is matched to the mrna codon at the a site , the transition from state 0 to sate 1 is occurred @xcite .",
    "the gtp hydrolysis and the release of ef - tu - gdp , promote a transition from state 1 to state 2 , called the `` accommodation state '' . in the accommodation state ,",
    "the trna at the p site is joint to the trna at the a site through a peptidyl bond . in this state",
    "the trna of the a site is twisted and as a result the anticodon and the associated mrna is displaced by 9 @xmath1 into the entry channel of the ribosome @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the polypeptide chain in this state is still attached to the trna at the p site . through the state 2 to the state 3 ,",
    "the stress is released by transferring of the polypeptide chain to the trna of the a site , and the two trnas of the p and a sites are detached from each other @xcite .",
    "the free trna at the p site has an affinity to the 50s e site , whereas at the same time the 50s p site has a specific interaction with the peptidyle trna .",
    "the mentioned interactions make the state 3 unstable and drive a ratchet like transition from the state 3 to the state 4 or `` the hybrid state '' @xcite .",
    "we note that in the state 4 , binding of an elongation factor , ef - g - gtp , stabilizes the hybrid state .",
    "the hydrolyses of gtp changes the conformation of the factor of ef - g and opens the mrna channel . as the result",
    ", the 30s subunit is displaced by one codon toward to the downstream of the mrna . at the same time",
    "both trnas that are bound to the mrna , keep their position on the mrna substrate ( state 5 ) @xcite . by dissociation of the tef - g - gdp ,",
    "the a site becomes empty and the two ribosomal subunits are aligned , whereas the ribosome goes from state 5 to state 0 @xcite .    : an ef - tu - dependent aa - trna binds to the a - site of the ribosome .",
    "step @xmath2 : the gtp hydrolyzes , the ef - tu is deformed and released , and as a result a peptidyl bond is formed between the trnas of the a- and p - sites .",
    "@xmath3 : the polypeptide chain is transferred to the trna of the a - site .",
    "@xmath4 : the elongation factor ef - g binds to the ribosome and promotes a ratchet like transition between state ( 3 ) and state ( 4 ) .",
    "@xmath5 : the gtp hydrolysis changes the conformation of the factor ef - g and drives the unlocking of the mrna channel and followed by mrna movement .",
    "@xmath6 : the ef - g is released and the mrna channel is relocked .",
    "the main elements of the translation process are shown in the last line . ]    to model the dynamics of the ribosome , consider the one - dimensional lattice with 6 different sites as described in fig .",

    "for example the external force as well as the concentration of the gtp can affect the free energy . in this paper for the sake of simplicity",
    "we ignore the effect of the mrna sequence of nucleotides on the dynamics of the motor ( i.e. , no n - dependence of the rates ) . in order to understand the effects of the gtp concentration and the external force on the behavior of the ribosome",
    ", we use the idea that the possible reaction at each state proceeds through an activated state with a higher energy @xcite .",

    "@xmath26 is the term that does not depend on the external force .",
    "in the following we study the behavior of the ribosome in three biological relevant situations : ( 1 ) in the presence of external force , ( 2 ) translation through the rnads ( rna double stranded ) region in the absence of the external force , and ( 3 ) translation through the rnads region in the presence of an external force .",

    "this deformation pulls the mrna into the mrna channel by @xmath28 .",
    "after that peptidyl transferring relaxes the stretched mrna . since there are some displacement in the mentioned processes , the external force can influence the transition rates correspondingly .",
