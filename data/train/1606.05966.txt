    "take any loop @xmath317 in @xmath318 , @xmath319 where the loop @xmath320 is in @xmath321 @xmath322",

    "@xmath330 we note that @xmath331 for every @xmath332 .",
    "so we have @xmath333 then , by @xmath334 , the margulis invariant @xmath335 is equal to : @xmath336    consider the first terms @xmath337 .",
    "we find these two unit vectors to satisfy lemma [ angle lemma ] , since , in @xmath47 , @xmath338 acts onto the a side of @xmath300 from @xmath299 .",
