    "although cosmic rays ( cr s ) were first discovered at the beginning of 20th century , they are still today a subject of intense study since we miss a complete understanding of their origin , composition and acceleration mechanisms .",
    "their energies extend from mev values ( with a flux of more than 1000 particles per second per square meter ) to more than @xmath0 gev ( less than one particle per km@xmath1 per century ) .",
    "in particular , unlike charged cosmic rays which are deflected by electromagnetic fields , photons and neutrinos travel almost unimpeded from their sources to earth ; therefore , their observation is very promising for unveil the details on production and acceleration mechanisms of cr s . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on very high energy ( vhe ) cr s in the energy range 100 gev @xmath2 100 eev ( 1 eev = @xmath3 ev ) ; in this energy region , due to the smallness of the flux , small detectors on balloons or in outer space are not adequate , and the atmosphere is usually employed as a big calorimeter to detect primary particles through the secondaries ( charged particles , fluorescence and cherenkov light ) that they produce hitting on air molecules . since , on one side , the dynamic energy range of a detector is limited to 2 - 3 orders of magnitude , and we are still considering , on the other side , an energy range of more than 10 orders of magnitude , we can expect that different techniques are used at different energies ; due to space limits , we will give details only on some representative experiment , both at low and high energy .",
    "in the low energy range ( @xmath4 tev ) , two different type of detectors are used both in @xmath5-ray astronomy and/or charged cr s detection : imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) or extensive air shower ( eas ) arrays . both of these techniques take advantage of the fact that , when a primary cr interacts with the atmosphere , it produces a shower of relativistic secondary particles which can be all collected or only sampled by an array of ground detectors in an eas configuration : the shower relativistic particles emit also cherenkov light , that can be focused by a mirror to a photomultiplier  camera \" of a iact detector .    in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite a list of iact experiments is given .",
    "an advantage of this approach over the satellite - based one is the collection area ( typically @xmath6 m@xmath1 , increasing with energy ) , almost five orders of magnitude larger than in the case of space detectors . on the other side ,",
    "iact technique differs from the other ground - based approaches in the better angular resolution , typically @xmath7 , which is the best of any astronomical technique above 0.1 mev , and the lower energy threshold , @xmath8 20 - 50 gev , almost bridging the gap with space - borne @xmath5 experiments , which are limited to @xmath9 few gev .",
    "iact instruments have also a superior instantaneous sensitivity , defined as the minimum flux ( in % of that of the crab nebula ) for which a source is detectable at a 5@xmath10 significance in 50 hours of observation .",
    "the advantages of stereoscopic measurements was firstly showed by the hegra collaboration @xcite : these allow a better reconstruction of direction and energy and the shower core location can be better established with improved resolution .",
    "a possible limit of iact detectors is the restricted field of view ( fov ) , @xmath11 : a consequence of this is , for example , that in a gamma ray burst ( grb ) observation these detectors can only be operated in  follow up \" mode , requiring a time of the order of minutes for pointing the object ( as an example , the magic @xcite telescopes have a slewing speed of @xmath12 s@xmath13 , about 3 times faster than hess s @xcite ones ) .",
    "moreover , a @xmath14 duty cycle is due to the need of astronomical darkness .    with a large fov ( @xmath82 sr ) and a duty cycle of almost 100% , eas arrays are a complementary technique to iact s for the detection of cr s . unlike the experiments of the first generation ( cignus @xcite , casa @xcite ) , where the instrumented area was @xmath8 1% of the total one , implying high energy thresholds , the new generation of experiments ( see table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of them ) used two different approaches to lower the energy threshold : to instrument a larger fraction of the total area , in such a way to raise the number of particles arriving to earth which are detected , and/or locate the detectors at higher altitude , where it is possible to detect the shower maxima of low energy showers .",
    "the observations coming from iact and eas experiments allow us to shed light on phenomena taking place in several galactic and extragalactic sources of cr : pulsars , binary systems , supernovae remnants , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , grb . in the following ,",
    "we will report some example for the two experiments magic @xcite and argo - ybj @xcite .",
    "the two magic iacts , spaced away at a distance of 85 m , are among the biggest instruments of this kind in operation and are located on la palma ( canary islands ) .",
    "the magic threshold for @xmath5-rays is 50 gev ( but it goes down to 25 gev when the so - called sum trigger system is employed ) and the energy resolution is @xmath8 25% above 200 gev . in recent years magic gave several contributions to galactic and extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "one example is the observation of the emission of the supernova remnant ic-443 , at a distance of 1.5 kpc ( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : it appears not coincident with the center of the snr shell , but is correlated with a maser emission .",
    "a possible source of this vhe radiation is @xmath15 decay coming from cr accelerated in the dense molecular cloud .",
    "the second example ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the measure of the @xmath5-ray flux of the x - ray binary system lsi + 61 303 , which clearly shows the periodic nature of the emission .",
    "very interesting is the regular monitoring campaign of the giant elliptical radio galaxy m87 , made together with hess @xcite and veritas @xcite . on february 1 , 2008 ,",
    "magic detected a flare which reached a maximum of 15% of the crab nebula flux ( see fig .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "argo - ybj @xcite is a collaboration between italy and china located in tibet .",
    "the detector consists of modules of 12 rpcs , to form an inner area of 5600 m@xmath1 , surrounded by 23 additional clusters (  guard ring \" ) .",
    "the array works in two independent data acquisition modes :  scaler \" and  shower \" mode . in scaler mode",
    ", each module counts the rates of events with a total number of hits @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 every 0.5 s , without any direction information ( grb searches ) . in shower mode ,",
    "a valid event requires at least 20 particles registered within 420 ns , with an angular resolution of 0.2@xmath20 for a primary above 10 tev and 2.5@xmath20 at @xmath8 100 gev .",
    "figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows the sky map for events with @xmath21 , corresponding to 424 days of data taking , after correcting for excesses in cr flux from the galactic anticentre .",
    "the crab nebula and mrk 421 are detected with statistical significance 7.0 and 8.0 , respectively . in fig .",
    "5 ( left ) of ref .",
    "@xcite it is reported the distribution of statistical significance of 26 grb detected by satellites in the period july 2006 - july 2007 and november 2007 - january 2009 , showing no excess neither as prompt nor prior / delayed emission .",
    "an important contribution of this experiment was also the measure of the production cross - section of protons and air nuclei @xcite , which follows from the angular distribution of showers .",
    "gamma ray astronomy at high energies has to face the problem of the photon pair production over the infrared and microwave backgrounds , which restricts the distances over which gamma rays can travel without attenuation .",
    "neutrinos would be the best messenger particles , if not for their very small cross - section with matter , which is an obstacle for their efficient detection .",
    "high energy experiments usually rely on charged cr detection .",
    "the biggest challenge of cr observations at high energy lies in the fact that the flux of particles is very small , implying the need of enormous exposures .",
    "two detector techniques are used in this range of energy : surface detector arrays on the ground ( as haverah park or agasa @xcite ) , or air fluorescence detectors ( as hires @xcite ) , which collect the fluorescence light emitted by nitrogen molecules hit by the secondary particles of an atmospheric shower . while in the first case the experiment samples only the lateral distribution of particles at a given atmospheric depth , relying on simulations for the determination of mass and energy of the primary particle , in the second case one can infer the longitudinal evolution of the shower in atmosphere , using the known proportionality between air fluorescence and charged particle energy loss . in particular , stereo configurations of fluorescence telescopes can be used , allowing an angular resolution of less than 1@xmath20 @xcite . however , while a surface array operates continuously , a drawback of the fluorescence technique is the low duty cycle of @xmath8 10% , due to the fact that one needs dark , moonless nights with good atmospheric conditions .",
    "the two types of detection techniques are complementary and the new generation of experiments ( pierre auger observatory @xcite , ta&tale @xcite ) uses both of them to check systematic errors .    at @xmath22 ev pion photoproduction of protons over the microwave background radiation gives a suppression of the cr flux ( nuclei photodisintegration and gamma ray pair production are the corresponding processes for the other cr components ) : this is the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect @xcite .",
    "other physics highlights for uhe crs are : their mass composition , the identification of their sources , the presence of photons or neutrinos together with charged crs .",
    "recent observations coming from new experiments allowed us to shed light on these topics . in the following , for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will only report some results of the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) experiment .",
    "18 countries cooperate in the pao experiment @xcite for building two cr observatories , one in the southern hemisphere , at malarge in argentina , completed in june 2008 , and one in the northern hemisphere , in colorado , under development .",
    "auger south consists of a surface detector ( sd ) array of 1600 water cherenkov , covering an area of about 3000 km@xmath1 on a triangular grid with 1.5 km spacing , and a fluorescence detector ( fd ) made by 24 optical telescopes in 4 buildings at four peripheral sites .",
    "figure 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows the energy spectrum of uhe crs derived from the combination , with a maximum likelihood method , of two kind of data : hybrid data , that is events detected with both the fd and the sd , which have a more accurate reconstructed energy ( data were collected between november 2005 and may 2008 ) and sd data ( until december 2008 ) .",
    "while the two sets have the same systematic uncertainty in the energy , the normalization uncertainties are additional constraints in the combination .",
    "the comparison with hires data shows some discrepancy , which can be partly reconciled by an energy shift of the energy scale of the two experiments .",
    "results single out the break in the power law of the cr spectrum called  ankle \" at log@xmath23 ( @xmath24/ev ) = 18.61@xmath250.01 and give indication of the gzk suppression at log@xmath23 ( @xmath24/ev ) = 19.61@xmath250.03 with more than 20@xmath10 statistical significance .",
    "the mass composition of cr at different energies can be inferred by the so - called  elongation rate \" , that is the change of the average depth of the shower maximum , @xmath26 , as a function of the energy .",
    "this is shown in fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( left plot ) , together with its shower - to - shower fluctuation , rms(@xmath27 ) ( right plot ) , a measure which is possible only thanks to the excellent resolution of fd ( @xmath8 20 g / cm@xmath1 ) .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath29 and rms(@xmath27 ) give indication of an increasing average mass of the primary particles with energy , somehow in contradiction with corresponding data from hires @xcite .",
    "some explanation was proposed for solving the puzzle , for example the unexpected changes of the depth of first interaction due to a rapid increase of cross section and/or increase of inelasticity above @xmath30 ev , which enhance the role of biases due to small statistics @xcite .",
    "finally , we briefly mention the pao results on the arrival directions of crs , referring for details the interested reader to the published papers @xcite .",
    "table i of ref .",
    "@xcite summarizes the results of the scan on the high energy events ( @xmath31 eev ) detected by the auger experiment in the period 1 january , 2004 through 26 may , 2006 ( exploratory period or period i ) and 27 may , 2006 through 31 march , 2009 ( periods ii and iii ) .",
    "a correlation over angular scales of less than 6@xmath20 with directions towards nearby agns , listed in the vron - cetty and vron catalog , is established , even if its degree seems to be weaker than suggested by earliest data ( period ii ) . while a clear interpretation of this signal has to wait for more data , remarkable features are that the values of the parameters that characterize the correlation are stable with time and , in particular , the threshold energy which maximizes it coincides with the gzk suppression one .",
    "iact technique is very promising for future experiments , since it has the potential for large improvements , like the increase of flux sensitivity , at the level of @xmath32 the crab nebula flux , by increasing the collection area from 0.1 km@xmath1 to @xmath33 1 km@xmath1 with the concept of large arrays of iacts .",
    "this enhancement , together with its good angular resolution , will allow joint studies with satellite experiments , like fermi - lat @xcite , which will help , for example , in breaking the degeneracy of leptonic and hadronic emission models .",
    "however , @xmath5-ray astronomy requires also new advanced eas array experiments , like hawc @xcite , since these can view continuously a large region of the sky .    at higher energies ,",
    "some enhancements are proposed for existing experiments , like areas of denser detector arrays , called  infill \" , for surface detectors , or extra fluorescence telescopes for enlarging the field of view of fluorescence detectors , both at the aim of going to lower energies , or / and the use of radio - detection technique .",
    "these will be very helpful in answering to some of the unknown questions about crs .",
    "in fact , we can be confident in some physical results indicated by experiments , like the existence of the gzk suppression at energies @xmath34 ev and the correlation between event directions and the super galactic plane .",
    "however , several questions remain still uncertain , like the mass composition at high energy or the identity of objects with which cr events correlate , which we trust will be addressed by the near future uhe cosmic - ray experiments ."
