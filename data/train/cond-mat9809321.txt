    "a large body of experimental evidence suggests that several high@xmath5 cuprate superconductors exhibit a pairing state of @xmath6 symmetry @xcite . in combination with the large superconducting transition temperature of these materials ,",
    "this suggests a superconducting pairing mechanism of predominantly electronic origin . in particular anti ",
    "ferromagnetic ( af ) spin fluctuation ( sf ) exchange has been proposed as a possible electronic candidate mechanism @xcite which would tend to give rise to @xmath6 pairing symmetry .",
    "however , except near certain `` optimal '' doping concentrations , many cuprates exhibit a quite noticeable doping dependent isotope effect@xcite and other pronounced , superconductivity - related lattice effects @xcite .",
    "this indicates that electron ",
    "phonon ( ep ) interactions could be important and should be included in the theory.@xcite    in the past decade , conserving self - consistent field ( scf ) methods@xcite and related diagrammatic approaches , such as the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite have been used to study af sf exchange within the framework of microscopic correlated electron models .",
    "most of the flex - based scf studies so far have been limited to hubbard - type models with instantaneous , local coulomb interactions in simple tight  binding models , and some extensions to long - range coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "for these types of model systems , both numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite and fast fourier transform ( fft)@xcite methods have been developed and successfully applied to solve the flex equations efficiently on large space - time lattices in the physically relevant low - temperature regime .",
    "the numerical solution of the flex equations is greatly simplified in instantaneous interaction models , due to the fact that the bare electron - electron interaction potential is frequency independent .    when ep interactions are introduced into the model ,",
    "already the bare electron - electron potential becomes explicitly frequency dependent , due the retarded nature of the phonon - mediated interaction .",
    "in that case , the solution of the flex equations requires the inversion of certain , large fermion frequency matrices which , in a brute force approach , would increase the demands on cpu time and memory consumption by several orders of magnitude , relative to the purely electronic models studied so far .",
    "also , neither fft approaches @xcite nor the original form of the nrg method @xcite can be used here to reduce the numerical effort to manageable proportions .",
    "previous scf studies of strongly correlated electron models with ep coupling @xcite have included renormalization of the coulomb and phonon - mediated potential at the level of an rpa particle - hole bubble . in this much simpler approach , one neglects the electron  electron exchange scattering which arises in the full flex approximation , due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this simpler rpa - based approximation @xcite then avoids the frequency matrix inversion problem , since the latter arises only from the exchange ladder diagrams .",
    "this may be a good approximation when the coulomb repulsion is strongly screened and the phonon frequency is small . these are , essentially , the conditions under which migdal s theorem is valid @xcite and the eliashberg theory @xcite of phonon - mediated conventional superconductivity is applicable . in general , these conditions may not be satisfied in correlated electron systems and it may be necessary to include both coulomb and ep contributions to the electron exchange vertex .    in the present paper",
    ", we describe an extension of the nrg approach which will allow us to incorporate ep interactions into a hubbard - type correlated electron model and handle the resulting frequency matrix inversions in the flex equations efficiently . an efficient algorithm to solve",
    "this matrix inversion problem in the present context is also an important first step towards studying the next level of scf theory , such as , for example , the parquet theory @xcite .",
    "our present treatment is limited to the case of the so  called holstein - hubbard model @xcite where the phonon - mediated electron - electron potential is without momentum dependence .",
    "however , when combined with recently developed real - space basis representation approaches,@xcite our basic method to the frequency matrix inversion problem will also become applicable to bare potentials which are frequency _ and _ momentum dependent .",
    "preliminary results obtained with our present frequency matrix nrg technique for the @xmath3-wave instability of the holstein - hubbard model have been reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a first detailed account of the technique itself , to present results for the @xmath2-wave instability and for the competition between @xmath3- and @xmath2-wave pairing in their respective parameter regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we summarize the flex approximation for the holstein  hubbard model and define the notations used in the paper . in section iii , we describe our fermion frequency matrix nrg technique in detail . in section iv , we present our results obtained with the nrg approach for the holstein  hubbard model .",
    "they include a comparison of results for one  particle correlation functions obtained with the nrg and , respectively , by the brute force approach ; and some applications to the superconducting instabilities and the isotope effect of the holstein  hubbard model .",
