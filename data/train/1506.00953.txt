    "the magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) are widely used in physical experiments , medicine ( magnetocardiographs and magnetoencephalographs ) , geophysics ( underground radars ) , electronic manufacturing ( squid microscopes ) .",
    "the sensitivity of squids and their quantum analogues , squbids , has practically reached the quantum limitation @xcite . however , with increase of the quantizing loop inductance up to @xmath1 , the thermodynamic fluctuations lead to expressed degradation of the energy resolution .    as shown earlier @xcite ,",
    "the sensitivity of the magnetometers can be considerably enhanced in this case by using the stochastic resonance ( sr ) effect .",
    "the sr phenomenon discovered in the early 1980s @xcite manifests itself in a non - monotonic rise of a nonlinear ( often bi - stable ) system response to a weak periodic signal which peaks at a certain intensity of the noise added ( or inherent ) to the system .",
    "owing to extensive studies during the last two decades , the stochastic resonance effect has been revealed in a variety of natural and artificial systems , both classical and quantum ones . analytical approaches and quantifying criteria for estimation of the noise - induced ordering were determined and then summarized in the reviews @xcite .",
    "for example , the gain of 40 db was experimentally demonstrated @xcite for a weak harmonic signal due to sr in a squid with the tunnel ( sis ) josephson junction . for an under - optimal noise intensity ,",
    "the signal gain in sr squids can be nevertheless maximized with the stochastic - parametric resonance ( spr ) effect @xcite emerging when the system is affected by the weak signal , the noise and an additional high - frequency electromagnetic field simultaneously .",
    "not so long ago , researchers paid their attention to clean small - sized superconducting contacts of `` constriction '' ( scs ) type called the `` atomic - size contacts '' , ascs @xcite .",
    "they have only a few quantum conductive channels in their cross section so they often referred to as the `` quantum point contacts '' , qpcs @xcite .",
    "the critical current @xmath2 of such contacts may take discrete values .",
    "the interest to the qpcs is roused by studies of the channel quantum conductivity and building superconducting qubits with large energy level splitting @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the current - phase relation ( the supercurrent @xmath4 as a function of the order parameter phase difference @xmath5 ) in the clean scs contacts with ballistic electron transit at low temperatures ( @xmath6 ) @xcite substantially differs from the classical josephson current - phase relation for a sis junction @xmath7 and features a `` saw - like '' shape with discontinuities at @xmath8 .",
    "the coupling energies for sis and scs obtained by integrating the current - phase relations therefore differ , too .",
    "if the sis junction is incorporated into a superconducting loop and an external magnetic flux @xmath9 is applied ( @xmath10 is the magnetic flux quantum ) , its current - phase relation forms the symmetric two - well potential of the loop , which is needed for sr , only at sufficiently large loop inductances and/or the junction critical current , namely , when @xmath11 .",
    "unlikely , the potential energy @xmath12 of the superconducting loop with a qpc has a `` sharp '' barrier with the singularity in its top separated two metastable current - carrying states of the loop with different intrinsic magnetic flux @xmath13 for any @xmath14 including @xmath15 .    in classical case for the zero - temperature limit ,",
    "the stochastic dynamics of the magnetic flux in a superconducting loop with the josephson scs contact ( scs squid ) substantially differs from that for sis squid studied earlier @xcite . taking into account the quantum fluctuations at finite temperatures @xmath0 changes the current - phase relation for the scs contact and smoothes the potential barrier in the loop with scs contact @xcite . in this work",
    "we analyze the stochastic amplification of weak low - frequency harmonic signals in a superconducting loop interrupted by josephson scs contact , at finite temperatures and various @xmath16 .",
    "the results are compared with the stochastic dynamics of a sis squid .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of the magnetic flux inside an rf squid loop ( inset in fig.[fig01 ] ) is studied by numerical solving the motion equation ( langevin equation ) in the model of resistively shunted junction ( rsj model ) :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the capacitance , @xmath19 and @xmath2 are the normal shunt resistance and the critical current of the josephson junction , respectively , @xmath20 is the magnetic flux inside loop , @xmath21 is the loop potential energy of the which is the sum of the loop magnetic energy @xmath22 and the josephson junction coupling energy @xmath23 .",
    "the time - dependent external magnetic flux @xmath24 applied to the loop contains the fixed and the varying components including the noise one .",
    "the junction coupling energy @xmath25 is type - determined ( for sis , scs , sns , etc . ) .",
    "the potential energy of a loop with the `` traditional '' tunnel ( sis ) junction is equal to @xcite    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is maximal coupling energy of the tunnel josephson junction .",
    "we consider the dynamics of the magnetic flux in the rf squid loop incorporating the clean scs contact with ballistic electron transit @xcite .    for classical @xcite and quantum @xcite scs contacts with the critical current @xmath2 the current - phase relation in the zero - temperature limit @xmath28    @xmath29    has the `` saw - like '' shape with discontinuities at @xmath30 .",
    "correspondingly , the potential energy of the superconducting loop with scs contact is    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the maximal coupling energy of the josephson scs contact .",
    "@xmath33 has singularities in tops of the barriers separating the adjacent local minima which correspond to the loop metastable current states .    introducing the dimensionless parameter of non - linearity    @xmath34    and reducing the fluxes by the",
    "flux quantum @xmath35 : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the potential energy by @xmath38 , expressions ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) can be rewritten , correspondingly , as    @xmath39    and    @xmath40    the potential energy @xmath41 of the loop with a tunnel junction has two or more local minima only at @xmath42 .",
    "it can be symmetrized by applying fixed magnetic field @xmath43 .",
    "fig.[fig01 ] shows potential energy of the loops with sis and scs contacts as a function of internal magnetic field at large @xmath44 for better visibility .",
    "the distinctive feature of the potential energy @xmath45 of an rf squid loop with the scs contact is the finite height of the `` sharp '' barrier between adjacent states for any vanishingly small @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath46 and/or @xmath2 ( at zero temperature ) .",
    "fig.[fig02 ] displays potential energies of the rf squids with sis or scs contact at several small @xmath16 .",
    "it is obvious from fig.[fig02 ] that the barrier separating the two metastable current - carrying states vanishes at @xmath47 in the sis squid while stays finite in the scs squid .",
    "the noise of thermal or any other origin causes switching between the metastable states corresponding to the minima of @xmath48 .",
    "the switching rate for the white gaussian noise with intensity ( variance ) @xmath49 for parabolic wells and @xmath50 is given by the kramers formula @xcite :    @xmath51    in the case of thermal noise for @xmath28 , @xmath52 .",
    "in this work we do not focus on any specific nature of the noise .",
    "the only requirement imposed to ensure the adiabatic mode of the squid switching is the limitation of the noise frequency band by a frequency not exceeding the reciprocal relaxation time for the internal flux in the squid loop @xmath53 .",
    "although the pre - exponential factor @xmath54 is different for the `` smooth '' potential of the sis squid and `` sharp '' potential of the scs squid ( details can be found in @xcite ) , the exponent factor dominates anyway . adding a small periodic signal with frequency @xmath55 to the external flux @xmath56 results in the stochastic - resonance system motion in the noise - driven bistable potential at    @xmath57    taking typical experimental figures @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , we found the mccamber parameter describing the effect of capacitance @xmath62 .",
    "this case corresponds to the viscous , non - oscillatory , motion and therefore the term with the second derivative in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "low signal frequency @xmath63 and noise cut - off frequency @xmath64 makes the problem adiabatic .",
    "this allows us the time dependence of the external flux consider as the time - dependent potential energy thus writing the motion equation in the form    @xmath65    with ( [ 6 ] ) for the sis junction , the eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) reads as    @xmath66 , \\ ] ]    and with ( [ 7 ] ) for the scs contact , as    @xmath67.\\ ] ]    the external flux @xmath68 is the sum of the fixed bias flux @xmath69 , the useful signal @xmath70 and the noise flux @xmath71 . in the theory ,",
    "the noise is often treated as the @xmath72-correlated white , gaussian - distributed noise : @xmath73 , @xmath74 . during the numerical simulation",
    ", it is modeled by the quasi - random number generator giving gaussian - distributed values with variance @xmath75 and the repetition period of about @xmath76 .",
    "the sampling rate is @xmath77 when solving the equation by finite differences technique that corresponds to the equivalent noise frequency band 32 khz .",
    "so , the noise can be considered as quasi - white for the stochastic amplification of the signal with frequency @xmath78 .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) were solved by the heun method modified for the stochastic equations @xcite .",
    "each run gave an 8-s - long time series with its individual noise realization and then were subjected to fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "the obtained output spectral densities @xmath79 of the internal flux were averaged over 30 runs .",
    "the spectral amplitude gain of the weak periodic signal was determined as the ration of spectral densities of the input ( external ) and output ( internal ) magnetic fluxes :    @xmath80",
    "the current - phase relation for the scs contact at a non - zero temperature @xmath81 @xcite    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the contact supercurrent , @xmath84 is the contact critical current , @xmath85 is the superconductor energy gap ( order parameter ) , @xmath5 is the order parameter phase difference over the contact , @xmath86 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath87 is the electron charge , @xmath19 is the contact normal resistance , smoothes , tending , as approaching the superconductor critical temperature @xmath88 , to the sine law that describes the sis junction .",
    "consequently , the ( reduced ) potential energy of the loop with scs contact    @xmath89    where @xmath90 , also becomes closer in its shape to the sis squid potential energy .",
    "the singularity in the barrier top disappears , while the barrier height decreases with the temperature rise .",
    "fig.[fig03 ] illustrates the temperature evolution of scs squid potential energy .",
    "the sis squid potential energy is also given in the figure for the comparison sake .",
    "in contrary to the zero - temperature case , the potential barrier vanishes at a certain reduced temperature even for @xmath91 ( at @xmath92 for the chosen @xmath93 ) the inter - minima spacing decreases , too .",
    "the barrier heights for the scs- and sis - squids become equal at a certain temperature ( at @xmath94 for the given case ) .    by substituting ( [ 15 ] ) in([10 ] ) , we get the motion equation for the reduced flux in scs squid at finite temperatures @xmath81 , @xmath95 , similar to eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) for the case @xmath28 .",
    "the solution of this equation at various noise intensities with further fft as described above gives the spectral gain of a weak signal as a function of the noise intensity , i.e. the sr curves .",
    "fig.[fig04 ] shows the sr curves in the scs squid calculated for several reduced temperatures and @xmath96 . strictly saying , @xmath14 parameter is indicated for @xmath28 , since it renormalizes as the temperature rises . for the comparison , the sr curve in a sis squid loop",
    "is displayed in the figure for the same @xmath16 .",
    "one can see that , with the temperature rise , the maximal gain in scs squid increases due to lowering of the barrier .",
    "this is much like a sis squid behavior when @xmath14 reduces down to the unity @xcite , so we consider the situation as a `` renormalization '' of @xmath16 in scs squids .",
    "when the barriers in the scs and sis squids are of the same height ( @xmath94 , see fig.[fig03 ] ) , the maximal gain is observed at equal noise intensities for both squids while the maximal gain values are different because of difference in the potential shapes and inter - minima spacings @xmath97 @xcite .    according to the two - state theory for linear response @xcite which does not accounts for inter - well dynamics , the weak - signal gain is determined by the spacing @xmath97 between the adjacent local minima of the system potential energy .",
    "taking the sr curves in fig.[fig04 ] for scs and sis squids with almost equal maximal gain ( @xmath98 for scs squid ) and looking up corresponding potential energies in fig.[fig04 ] , we can see that @xmath97 values are somewhat different .",
    "this implies that the exact shapes of the potential profile should be involved in accurate theoretical calculation .",
    "nevertheless , it can be generally stated that the stochastic amplification of an informational signal in scs squids with small @xmath14 will reveal its specific features at ultra - low temperatures .",
    "the calculation shows the potential barrier in scs squid with @xmath99 vanishes at @xmath100 , that for niobium with its critical temperature @xmath101 corresponds to a millikelvin temperature range . at such low temperatures",
    ", quantum effects will give a dominant contribution in switching rate @xcite .",
    "moreover , the `` sharp '' potential of a superconducting loop with scs contact makes quantum tunneling between separated wells much faster as compared to a `` common '' sis circuit .",
    "this feature allowed authors of @xcite to propose a superconducting qutrit - detector with tunneling rate of 20 - 30 ghz ( which was important there for large energy level splitting ) .",
    "thus , an interesting situation could emerge in scs squids at ultra - low temperatures when two characteristic time scales would occur in the context of stochastic resonance , one for classical hops over the barrier and other for quantum tunneling through it .",
    "the calculation of amplification of a weak harmonic signal on a noisy background due to the stochastic resonance in an rf squid loop with a clean scs contact in the zero - temperature limit shows that the sr in scs squid is possible at any vanishingly small @xmath102 because of unusual `` sharp '' potential barrier between metastable states whose height is always finite at @xmath28 .    with the scs squid temperature rise , the top of the barrier smoothes",
    ", its height gradually vanishes to zero , and the potential of the scs squid becomes much like that of `` common '' sis squid .",
    "thus , the substantial difference in classic stochastic dynamics of magnetic flux of scs and sis squids emerge at ultra - low temperatures",
    ". the difference will become more distinctive if quantum tunneling contribution is taken into account .",
    "these distinctions should be considered , as useful or `` parasitic '' effect , in designing deep - cooled devices involving superconducting loops with incorporated josephson junctions , such as squids and qubits .",
