    "starbursts are short - lived episodes of intense star - formation that usually occur in the ` circum - nuclear ' ( kpc - scale ) regions of galaxies , and dominate the integrated emission from the ` host ' galaxy ( leitherer _ et al .",
    "starbursts are major components of the local universe ( e.g. gallego _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; soifer _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) , and are the sites of @xmath3 25% of the total ( high - mass ) star - formation in the local universe ( heckman 1997 ) .",
    "the cosmological relevance of starbursts has been dramatically underscored by the spectacular discovery of populations of high - redshift ( @xmath4 2 ) star - forming field galaxies selected by their rest - frame ultra - violet continuum emission ( steidel _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; lowenthal _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , rest - frame far - infrared emission ( e.g. hughes _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; barger , cowie , & richards 1999 ; cowie , this conference ) , ly@xmath5 emission ( hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ) , and h@xmath5 emission ( teplitz , malkan , & mclean 1998 ; mannucci _ et al .",
    "the co - moving space density and luminosity of these galaxies imply that they almost certainly represent precursors of typical present - day galaxies and are responsible for the production of a significant fraction of the stars and heavy elements in the present - day universe ( e.g. madau _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; blain _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; calzetti & heckman 1998 ) .",
    "starbursts may also play a vital energetic or evolutionary role in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "there have been recurring suggestions to this effect in the seyfert galaxy phenomenon ( e.g. weedman 1983 ; perry & dyson 1985 ; terlevich & melnick 1985 ; norman & scoville 1988 ; cid fernandez & terlevich 1995 ) . on a more global scale , the rough proportionality between the mass of a supermassive black hole and that of the stellar spheroid in which it now resides ( magorrian _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; van der marel 1999 ) strongly suggests that the quasar phenomenon is an intimate part of the formation or early evolution of massive ellipticals and bulges .    in this contribution i will therefore discuss the relevance of local starbursts to understanding the high - redshift universe and its major baryonic components : star - forming galaxies , agn , and the inter - galactic medium . in  2",
    "i will argue that starbursts are the only local analogues to the star - forming galaxies observed at high - redshift , and will summarize some of inferences that follow . in  3",
    "i will describe the systematic properties of starburst - driven galactic superwinds and summarize the cosmological implications of these outflows . in  4",
    "i will present a status report on efforts to understand the energetic / evolutionary significance of young stars in / near the nuclei of seyfert galaxies . then , in  5 i will report new results on the properties of the host galaxies of high - redshift radio - quiet quasars , and compare these to theoretical expectations .",
    "starburst galaxies are the only plausible local analogues to the population of star - forming galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that local starbursts and high - redshift lyman - break galaxies have similar rest - frame uv surface brightnesses and uv colors . using the empirical correlation between uv color and extinction for local starbursts ,",
    "the implied bolometric surface - brightnesses of the high - z galaxies are thus also very similar to local starbursts : typically @xmath3 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 l@xmath8 kpc@xmath9 .",
    "the high - redshift lyman - break galaxies appear to be ` scaled - up ' ( larger and more luminous ) versions of local starbursts .",
    "the intrinsic uv surface brightnesses are roughly three orders - of - magnitude higher than the disks of normal spirals , and indeed normal spirals at @xmath1 3 ( if they exist ) would be virtually undetectable in @xmath10 rest - uv images due to their low surface- brightness ( e.g. hibbard & vacca 1997 ; lanzetta _ et al . _ 1999 ) .",
    "the similarity in the surface - brightnesses of local starbursts and lyman - break galaxies immediately implies that there are also strong similarities in their basic physical properties .",
    "a high uv surface - brightness implies a high star - formation rate per unit area ( @xmath11 ) and thus high surface - mass - densities in the stars ( @xmath12 ) and the interstellar gas ( @xmath13 ) that fuels the star - formation .",
    "a typical case would have @xmath14 10 m@xmath8 year@xmath0 kpc@xmath9 and @xmath15 10@xmath16 m@xmath8 kpc@xmath9 .",
    "these are roughly 10@xmath17 ( @xmath11 ) , 10@xmath18 ( @xmath13 ) and 10@xmath19 ( @xmath12 ) times larger than the corresponding values in the disks of normal galaxies .    the basic physical and dynamical properties of starbursts and the lyman - break objects follow directly from the above .",
    "a gas surface - mass - density of 10@xmath16 m@xmath8 kpc@xmath9 corresponds to an extinction of @xmath20 10@xmath18 for a milky way dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the characteristic dynamical time in the star - forming region will be short : @xmath21 @xmath3 @xmath22 @xmath3 @xmath23 @xmath3 few myr , where @xmath24 10@xmath18 pc is the thickness of the disk .",
    "a surface - brightness of a few @xmath25 10@xmath6 l@xmath8 kpc@xmath9 corresponds to a radiant energy density inside the star - forming region that is roughly 10@xmath17 times the value in the ism of the milky way .",
    "finally , simple considerations of hydrostatic equilibrium imply correspondingly high total pressures in the ism : @xmath26 few @xmath25 10@xmath27 dyne cm@xmath9 ( p / k @xmath3 few @xmath25 10@xmath29 k @xmath30 , or several thousand times the value in the local ism in the milky way ) . the rate of mechanical energy deposition ( supernova heating ) per unit volume is also 10@xmath17 or 10@xmath31 times higher than in the ism of our galaxy .",
    "to summarize , the strong empirical similarity between local starbursts and the high - z lyman break galaxies implies strong similarity in their basic physical properties .",
    "the conclusion seems inescapable : _ if we want to understand the lyman break galaxies in the early universe , we need to understand local starbursts . _    as discussed by heckman _",
    "( 1998 ) , local starbursts occupy a very small fractional volume in the multi- dimensional manifold defined by such fundamental parameters as the extinction , metallicity , and vacuum - uv line strengths ( both stellar and interstellar ) of the starburst and the rotation speed ( mass ) and absolute magnitude of the starburst s ` host ' galaxy .",
    "in particular , more massive galaxies host more luminous , more metal - rich , and dustier ( more heavily - extincted ) starbursts .",
    "there are simple physical explanations for these trends .",
    "firstly , simple considerations of causality for a self - gravitating system with a gas mass @xmath32 imply that the maximum possible star - formation rate is given by the conversion of all the gas into stars in one crossing time : @xmath33 .",
    "thus , more massive galaxies ( with larger velocity dispersions @xmath34 ) can sustain bursts with higher star - formation rates and therefore larger luminosities .",
    "the physical basis for the strong observed correlation between galaxy mass and metallicity will be discussed in  3 below . finally , the trend for more metal - rich starbursts to be more heavily extincted follows provided that neither the gas column density towards the starburst , nor the fraction of interstellar metals locked into dust grains are strong inverse functions of metallicity .",
    "the result of these correlations is that an ultraviolet census of the local universe would not only underestimate the true star - formation - rate , it would systematically under - represent the most powerful , most metal - rich starbursts occurring in the most massive galaxies .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in the recent comparison of the vacuum - uv and far - ir galaxy luminosity functions at low - redshift by buat & burgarella ( 1998 ) .",
    "estimates of star - formation rates at high - redshift based on rest - frame vacuum - uv sample selection probably suffer the same bias , and thus may under- represent the ultra - luminous progenitors of the most massive present - day spheroids .",
    "it is tempting to speculate ( based on the empirical properties of local starbursts ) that the @xmath35 far - ir - selected sources at high - z may represent just such objects .",
    "this speculation is consistent with the relative space densities of the most luminous lyman - break galaxies and the @xmath35 sources ( meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1999 ) .",
    "_ clearly , we can not understand the cosmic evolution of the star - formation rate and the formation and evolution of galaxies without a panchromatic approach . _",
    "over the last few years , observations have provided convincing evidence of the existence ( and even the ubiquity ) of ` superwinds ' - galactic - scale outflows of gas driven by the collective effect of multiple supernovae and stellar winds in a starburst ( e.g. lehnert & heckman 1996 ; dahlem , weaver , & heckman 1999 ; martin 1999 ) .    in this section",
    "i will summarize the systematic properties of superwinds as gleaned from the analysis of their x - ray emission and the uv / optical absorption - lines .",
    "the x - ray data have proven particularly important since they are the only direct probe of the energetically - dominant ` piston ' of hot gas that drives the flow .",
    "the interstellar absorption - lines trace cooler and denser gas that has probably been entrained into the outflowing hot gas ( e.g. suchkov _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) , and supply crucial complementary data .",
    "they provide unambiguous information about the magnitude and _ sign _ of the radial velocities of the gas , more fully sample the whole range of gas densities in the outflow ( rather than being strongly weighted in favor of the densest material which may contain relatively little mass ) , and can be used to study outflows in high - redshift galaxies where the associated x - ray or optical _ emission _ may be undetectably faint ( franx _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; pettini _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "( 350,500 ) ( -30,-80 )    martin ( 1999 ) has empirically quantified the global effects of intense star - formation on the interstellar medium by estimating the outflow rates and velocities for a local sample of starburst and related galaxies .",
    "i will follow her approach , but update it by adding new x - ray results on additional galaxies , and improve upon it by including results from our ( heckman _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 - hlsa ) analysis of the interstellar absorption- lines in starbursts ( a data type not considered by martin ) .",
    "the principal results are as follows :    * _ the outflow speeds are typically 400 to 800 km s@xmath0 independent of the rotation speed of the ` host ' galaxy . _ this result is shown in figure 1 .",
    "hlsa show that the absorbing gas typically spans a velocity range from close to the galaxy systemic velocity up to some maximum blueshift .",
    "they argued that this can be understood if the hot outflow is ablating material off of cold dense clouds and then accelerating it up to some terminal velocity .",
    "it is these inferred terminal velocities that are plotted in figure 1 . in the case of the x - ray data ,",
    "outflow velocities can not be directly observed .",
    "instead , we have estimated the outflow speed from the observed gas temperature following chevalier & clegg s ( 1985 ) solution for an adiabatic wind fed by gas at a temperature t : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mean mass per particle .",
    "this is a conservative approach as it ignores any kinetic energy the x - ray - emitting gas may already have .",
    "it is encouraging that the overall agreement between the two data sets is satisfactory . * _ the implied outflow rates of metal - enriched material probably exceed the star - formation rate .",
    "_ i have calculated star - formation rates for a large sample of starburst galaxies for which mass outflow rates can be estimated from either interstellar absorption - lines , x - ray emission , or h@xmath5 emission - line kinematics .",
    "the star formation rates assume a salpeter initial mass function extending from 0.3 to 100 @xmath38 .",
    "for the outflow rates based on the absorption - line data , i follow hlsa and set these equal to @xmath39 m@xmath8/yr , where @xmath40 is the radius of the region of mass - injection ( the starburst ) , @xmath41 is the total column density in the absorbing material , @xmath42 is the mean outflow velocity , and @xmath43 is the solid angle filled by the outflow .",
    "i adopted the values measured or estimated for these parameters by hlsa , lehnert & heckman ( 1995 ) , and armus , heckman , & miley ( 1990 ) .",
    "for the outflow rates derived from the x - ray data , i have simply taken the inferred mass of hot gas ( assuming a volume filling factor of unity ) and divided it by the outflow time ( @xmath3 sound - crossing time ) for the x - ray emitting region .",
    "i also include the estimates for the outflow rates in the warm ionized gas from martin ( 1999 ) , which are based on the observed velocities in the h@xmath5-emitting gas and the masses derived by assuming that this gas is in pressure balance with the ram pressure of the superwind ( see martin 1999 for details ) . while each method is crude , and makes simplifying assumptions that may be unwarranted , it is gratifying that the three methods yield similar results : the median value for @xmath44 = 1.4 for the absorption - line data , 2.8 for the x - ray data , and 1.6 for the h@xmath5 data .",
    "in fact , since these three methods measure different gas phases , the _ total _ outflow rate could be approximated as the sum of the three rates .",
    "thus , gas is being expelled from starbursts at a rate in excess of the rate that gas is being processed into stars . * _ the implied outflow rates of kinetic / thermal energy are a significant fraction of the total injection rate by supernovae and stellar winds . _",
    "the rate at which superwinds carry energy is uncertain .",
    "simple estimates can be made from the x - ray data by calculating the thermal energy content in the hot gas ( assuming unit volume filling factor ) and dividing this by the dynamical time for the x - ray - emitting region . as emphasized by strickland ( 1998 ) ,",
    "this ignores the effects of clumping ( which will reduce the thermal energy ) and of the supersonic flow speeds ( which represent significant kinetic energy ) .",
    "energy ( more properly momentum ) outflow rates can also be deduced from the radial pressure gradients observed via standard optical emission - line diagnostics , assuming that these trace the sum of the ram- and thermal pressure in the outflow ( e.g. heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "both techniques suggest that the majority of the kinetic / thermal energy supplied by the supernovae and stellar winds is being carried out in the flow ( and has not been radiated away ) .",
    "the key seems to be that the porosity of the starburst ism is high , so that most supernovae detonate in a rarefied pre - heated medium ( e.g. heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ; marlowe _ et al .",
    "* _ the outflows are apparently quite dusty , with inferred reddenings of @xmath45 1 over regions of a - few - to - ten kpc in size .",
    "_ hlsa mapped the na-@xmath46 interstellar absorption - line over regions with sizes of a few to ten kpc in a sample of 18 starbursts .",
    "figure 2 shows the strong correlation they found between the depth of the absorption - line profile ( roughly proportional to the fraction of the emitting region covered by absorbing gas ) and the line - of - sight reddening towards the emitting region . the observed reddening is substantial , with @xmath45 0.9@xmath470.4 ( corresponding to @xmath48 several @xmath25 10@xmath49 cm@xmath9 for normal galactic dust ) .",
    "this generalizes phillips s ( 1993 ) discovery of a spectacularly dusty few - kpc - scale outflow in the halo of the starburst galaxy ngc1808 .",
    "( 350,500 ) ( -30,-80 )    the three results above have a variety of important implications .",
    "the independence of the outflow speed on the galaxy rotation speed strongly suggests that the outflows selectively escape the potential wells of the less massive galaxies , carrying metals with them .",
    "this process plausibly accounts for the strong mass - metallicity relation in ellipticals and bulges .",
    "lynden - bell ( 1992 ) has proposed an appealingly simple model in which the fraction of starburst - produced metals that are retained by a galaxy experiencing an outflow is proportional to the galaxy potential - well depth for galaxies with @xmath50 , and asymtotes to full retention for the most massive galaxies ( @xmath51 ) . for @xmath52 in the range we measure ( figure 1 ) , such a simple prescription can reproduce the observed mass - metallicity relation for spheroids ( lynden - bell 1992 ) .    at the same time , superwinds could deposit the required amount of observed metals in the intra - cluster medium ( e.g. gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky 1997 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy carried out by superwinds at high redshift could be the agent that ` preheated ' the proto - intracluster medium prior to the collapse / formation of rich clusters ( ponman , cannon , & navarro 1999 ; evrard , this volume ) .",
    "if the ratio of ejected metals to stellar spheroid mass is the same globally as in clusters of galaxies , the present - day mass - weighted metallicity of a general intergalactic medium with @xmath53 = 0.015 will be @xmath3 1/6 solar ( see also renzini 1997 ) .",
    "these intergalactic metals could reconcile the apparent deficit in the inventory of metals contained by stars in the present universe compared to the expectations based on the integrated amount of high - mass star - formation over cosmic time ( e.g. aguirre 1999 ) .",
    "pettini ( this volume ) notes a similar problem with ` missing metals ' at high - z .",
    "highly - ionized superwind ejecta may be a plausible place to hide them .",
    "superwinds may also help alleviate the problems with understanding the apparently wide distribution of metals in the ly-@xmath5 forest ( pettini , this volume ; efstathiou , this volume ) .",
    "more speculatively , _ if _ the outflowing dust survives its journey , the cumulative effect of dusty superwinds could lead to a cosmologically - significant amount of intergalactic dust ( @xmath54 = few @xmath25 10@xmath55 ) , which would seriously affect the hubble diagram for type ia supernovae ( aguirre 1999 ; aguirre & haiman 1999 ) . finally , kronberg , lesch , & hopp ( 1999 ) have argued that a substantial fraction of the inter - galactic medium at high - redshift can be permeated with magnetic fields carried out of the first generation of galaxies by early superwinds .",
    "there have been many observational investigations into the possible presence of starbursts in seyfert nuclei , and it is beyond the scope of this contribution to review this literature .",
    "instead , i want to briefly report on efforts by our group to make direct spectroscopic detections of hot , massive stars in a large , unbiased sample of seyfert nuclei .    according to the standard ` unified ' picture for radio - quiet agn",
    "the principal building blocks for a seyfert nucleus are : 1 . a supermassive black hole and its associated accretion disk ( the primary source of x - ray through optical continuum emission ) 2 . an optically- and geometrically - thick circum - nuclear torus of dust and gas , with an inner radius of a few pc and an ill - defined outer radius ( of - order 10@xmath18 pc ) .",
    "it is viewed close to its equatorial plane ( polar axis ) in type 2 ( type 1 ) seyferts .",
    "3 . a ` mirror ' of dust and/or warm electrons located along the polar axis of the torus . thus , the optimal targets in which to search for hot stars are the type 2 seyfert nuclei , in which the torus providentially blocks out the blinding glare from a hidden type 1 seyfert nucleus .",
    "indeed , type 2 seyfert nuclei have long been known to exhibit a ` featureless continuum ' ( ` @xmath56 ' ) that produces most of the uv light and typically 10% to 30% of the visible / nir light ( the rest appears to be light from an ordinary old population of stars ) . until recently , it was thought that the optical / uv @xmath56 was mostly light from the hidden type 1 seyfert nucleus that had been reflected into our line - of - sight by the mirror .    instead ,",
    "if at least part of the @xmath56 is produced by a population of hot stars , it should not actually be featureless !",
    "instead , spectroscopy in the blue and near - uv should show the high - order balmer lines in absorption ( unlike h@xmath5 and h@xmath57 , which are dominated by nebular emission ) and weak hei stellar photospheric lines ( gonzalez - delgado _ et al .",
    "spectra in the vacuum - uv should reveal strong stellar wind lines and weaker stellar photospheric lines ( cf",
    ". de mello , leitherer , & heckman 1999 ) . to test this possibility ,",
    "we have therefore undertaken a program to obtain high - resolution vacuum - uv images and spectra ( with @xmath10 ) and near - uv spectra ( with ground - based telescopes ) of a representative sample of the brightest type 2 seyfert nuclei .",
    "the first results have been presented in detail in heckman _",
    "( 1997 ) and gonzalez - delgado _ et al . _",
    "@xmath10 imaging shows that the uv continuum source in every case is spatially - resolved ( scale size few hundred pc or greater ) . in some cases",
    "the morphology is strikingly reminiscent of uv images of starbursts . in other cases , a component of the uv continuum",
    "is roughly aligned with the inferred polar axis of the obscuring torus ( as expected for reflected and/or reprocessed light from the central engine ) .",
    "of the original sample of 13 type 2 seyfert with @xmath10 vacuum - uv images , only four were bright enough for us to obtain spectra of adequate quality in the crucial uv spectral window from about 1200 to 1600   .",
    "however , these spectra are decisive : all four show the clear spectroscopic signature of a starburst population that dominates the uv continuum .",
    "in addition to classic strong stellar wind features ( nv@xmath581240 , siiv@xmath581400 , and civ@xmath581550 ) , we can also detect weaker and much narrower absorption features from highly - excited transitions ( which are therefore indisputably of stellar origin ) .",
    "in each of the four cases , if we use the empirical ` starburst attenuation law ' ( calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ; meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1999 ) to correct the observed uv continuum for dust extinction , we find that the bolometric luminosity of the nuclear ( 10@xmath59-pc - scale ) starburst is comparable to the estimated bolometric luminosity of the ` hidden ' type 1 seyfert nucleus ( of - order 10@xmath6 l@xmath8 ) .",
    "large - aperture uv spectra with @xmath60 imply the existence of a surrounding larger - scale ( few kpc ) and more powerful ( few @xmath25 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 l@xmath8 ) dusty starburst that is energetically capable of powering the bulk of the observed far - ir emission from the galaxy .",
    "thus , starbursts are an energetically significant ( or even dominant ) component of at least _ some _ seyfert galaxies",
    ".    however , we have @xmath10 spectra of only four type 2 seyferts , and these are strongly biased in favor of cases with high uv surface- brightness .",
    "can we say anything more general ? to address this , we have embarked on a program to obtain spectra from about 3500 to 9000    of a complete sample of the 25 brightest type 2 seyfert nuclei in the local universe .",
    "these objects are selected from extensive lists of known seyfert galaxies on the basis of the flux of either the nebular line - emission from the narrow line region ( the [ oiii]@xmath585007 line ) or of the nuclear radio source ( whittle 1992 ) .",
    "we are still analyzing these spectra , but even a cursory inspection of the near uv region ( below 4000   ) shows that about half have pronounced balmer absorption - lines whose strength is consistent with a population of late o or early b stars . in several cases",
    "we can also detect those photospheric hei absorption - lines ( @xmath584921 , @xmath584387 , @xmath583819 ) that are not filled in by nebular emission . in most of the remainder of the sample ,",
    "the @xmath56 is so weak relative to the light from a normal old - bulge stellar population that its origin is still not clear .",
    "recent work in a related vein has been undertaken by cid fernandes , storchi - bergmann , & schmitt ( 1998 ) and schmitt , storchi - bergmann , & cid fernandes ( 1999 ) .",
    "their results agree at least qualitatively with ours : they find that most of the optical and near - uv @xmath56 in type 2 seyfert nuclei is produced by young and intermediate age stars ( age @xmath61 100 myr ) .",
    "thus , it is clear that massive stars and starbursts play an important energetic role in a significant fraction of seyfert nuclei .",
    "what is not yet clear is whether starbursts are an _ essential _ component of the seyfert phenomenon and what ( if any ) the causal or evolutionary connection might be . perhaps - as cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1995 ) suggested - the starburst is an inevitable byproduct of the dense molecular torus that is now believed to be a fundamental part of the inner machinery of agn ( both obscuring the ` central engine ' and serving as its fuel source ) .",
    "if true , this would have major implications for the relationship between quasars and galaxy formation .",
    "the cosmic evolution of the population of powerful radio galaxies has been well - documented over the past decade ( see the volume edited by rottgering , best , & lehnert 1999 )",
    ". the uniformity of the k - band hubble diagram out to @xmath62 and the evolution of the red - envelope in the visible and near - ir colors are consistent with a large redshift of formation and the subsequent passive evolution of the progenitors of ( some ) present - day giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. lilly 1989 ; eales & rawlings 1996 ; mccarthy 1999 ) .",
    "much less is known about the evolution of the population of the hosts of radio - loud quasars , but the available data paint a broadly similar picture ( e.g. lehnert _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; ridgway & stockton 1997 ; mclure _ et al .",
    "this is consisent with the standard ` unified model ' in which radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies are drawn from the same parent population , but the quasars ( radio galaxies ) are viewed roughly along ( perpendicular to ) the polar axis of a dusty torus ( barthel 1989 ) .    while the notion of the `` monolithic '' formation of apparently - massive elliptical galaxies at high redshifts does not fit comfortably into the standard cdm picture of hierarchical assembly at late times , powerful radio galaxies are exceedingly rare objects . for h@xmath63",

    "these values can be compared to the present - day space - density of first - ranked cluster galaxies ( roughly 5000 gpc@xmath68 - bahcall & cen 1993 ) . even allowing for a short lifetime for the radio galaxy phase , the evolved descendants of _ powerful",
    "_ radio galaxies would account for only a small minority of the first - ranked cluster elliptical galaxies .",
    "in contrast , radio - quiet quasars are far more common , and therefore more likely to be progenitors of typical present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "radio - quiet quasars with @xmath69 -23 have co - moving space densities at z@xmath32 of @xmath32@xmath25 10@xmath31 gpc@xmath68 ( hartwick & schade 1990 ) .",
    "now , for a quasar lifetime of - order the eddington growth - time ( a few % of the hubble time at z = 2 ) , the implied space density of the present - day descendants is of - order 10@xmath70 gpc@xmath68 , which is comparable to the space density of @xmath2 e s and s0 s ( e.g. fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "this identification is quite consistent with the correlation between the masses of supermassive black hole and the spheroids in which they live today .",
    "a quasar with @xmath71 = -24 powered by accretion at the eddington rate requires @xmath72 2 @xmath25 10@xmath73 @xmath38 , and this supermassive black hole would live today in spheroid with a mass of @xmath74 5 @xmath25 10@xmath6 @xmath38 and v - band luminosity of about 1.5 @xmath25 10@xmath6 @xmath75 @xmath3 0.4 @xmath2 ( magorrian _ et al .",

    "1999 - rhcl ) have imaged 5 faint ( m@xmath78 -23 ) radio - quiet quasars , complementing the analysis reported by rix _",
    "et al . _ 1999 ) of six luminous ( @xmath79 -26 ) gravitationally - lensed cases .",
    "some examples of the underlying hosts galaxies in the rhcl sample are shown in figure 3 .",

    "_ 1999 ) :    * typical radio - quiet quasars at @xmath1 2 are hosted by galaxies with rest - frame absolute visual magnitudes similar to present - day @xmath2 galaxies ( @xmath80 = -20 to -23 = @xmath811.5 mag ) .",
    "* as such , they are much fainter than radio galaxies at the same redshift ( typically by @xmath3 2 magnitudes ) .",
    "* these host galaxies are -if anything- _ less _ luminous than the hosts of similarly - powerful low - z radio - quiet quasars .",
    "since the luminosity - weighted mean age of the stellar population in the high - z hosts is almost certainly younger than that of the low - z hosts , the difference in stellar _ mass _ will be even more pronounced . *",
    "the rest - frame - visual luminosities and sizes of the radio - quiet quasar hosts are roughly similar to those of the lyman - break galaxies .",
    "thus , the lyman - break population _ might _ represent the parent population of typical radio - quiet quasars .",
    "our cycle 8 hst program will determine whether this similarity extends into the rest - frame uv .",
    "the potential implications of these results are quite tantalizing .",
    "first , they imply that the well - studied cosmic evolution of the hosts of the very - radio - loud agn population is evidently _ not _ representative of the much more numerous radio - quiet population .",
    "second , if we make the simplifying assumptions that the ratio of @xmath82 is roughly independent of redshift and that @xmath83 , then it follows that supermassive black holes form well before their host galaxies are fully assembled .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the idea of the hierarchical assembly of massive galaxies at late epochs . indeed , as already pointed out by rix _",
    "( 1999 ) and rhcl , the observations ( figure 4 ) agree rather well with the recent theoretical predictions of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 1999 ) .",
    "if the reader takes away only four ideas from my contribution , i hope they are the following : + 1 .",
    "starburst galaxies are good analogues ( in fact , the only plausible local analogues ) to the known population of star - forming galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "integrated over cosmic time , supernova - driven galactic - winds ( ` superwinds ' ) play an essential role in the evolution of galaxies and the inter - galactic medium .",
    "circumnuclear starbursts are an energetically - significant component of the seyfert phenomenon .",
    "the evolution of the population of the host galaxies of radio - quiet quasars is significantly different than that of powerful radio galaxies , and is at least qualitatively consistent with the standard picture of the hierarchical assembly of massive galaxies at relatively late times .",
