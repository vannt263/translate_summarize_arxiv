    "it is suggested that the light mesons could be grouped into the following regge trajectories@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lowest - lying meson mass , @xmath33 is the radial quantum number , and @xmath34 is the slope parameter of the corresponding trajectory . in fig .",

    "if one accepts that the @xmath29 , @xmath27 , and @xmath1 belong to the @xmath4 meson nonet , the nearly degenerate masses of the @xmath27 and the @xmath29 would imply that the @xmath27 is mainly @xmath40 .",
    "no observation of the @xmath27 state in the @xmath41 process  @xcite favors this argument .",
