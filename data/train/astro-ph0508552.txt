    "the shape of the stellar velocity ellipsoid , defined by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , provides key insights into the dynamical state of a galactic disk : @xmath7:@xmath5 provides a measure of disk heating and @xmath6:@xmath5 yields a check on the validity of the epicycle approximation ( ea ) .",
    "additionally , @xmath5 is a key component in measuring the stability criterion and in correcting rotation curves for asymmetric drift ( ad ) , while @xmath7 is required for measuring the disk mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the latter is where the diskmass survey focuses ( verheijen et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) ; however , in anything but face - on systems , @xmath7 must be extracted via decomposition of the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity dispersion .",
    "below , we present such a decomposition for two galaxies in the diskmass sample : ngc 3949 and ngc 3982 .    previous long - slit studies ( e.g. , shapiro et al . 2003 and references therein ) acquired observations along the major and minor axes and performed the decomposition via the ea and ad equations ; using both dynamical equations overspecifies the problem such that ad is often used as a consistency check .",
    "here , use of the sparsepak ( bershady et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) integral field unit ( ifu ) automatically provides multiple position angles , thereby increasing observing efficiency and ensuring signal extraction along the desired kinematic axes .",
    "long - slit studies have also used functional forms to reduce the sensitivity of the above decomposition method to noise . here , only measures of the los velocity dispersions within a 40@xmath0 wedge about the major axis are used to perform the decomposition by incorporating both the ea and ad equations under some simplifying assumptions .",
    "velocities and radii within the wedge are projected onto the major axis according to derived disk inclinations , @xmath8 , and assuming near circular motion . in the end",
    ", our method requires neither fitted forms nor error - prone interpolation between the major and minor axes . future work will compare this decomposition method with the multi - axis long - slit method and investigate effects due to use of points off the kinematic axes .",
    "following derivations in binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) and assuming ( 1 ) ea holds , ( 2 ) the velocity ellipsoid shape and orientation is independent of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , ( 3 ) both the space density , @xmath11 , and @xmath5 have an exponential fall off radially with scale lengths of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and ( 4 ) the circular velocity is well - represented by the gaseous velocity , @xmath14 , the equation for the ad of the stars becomes @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean stellar rotation velocity ; hence , @xmath5 is the only unknown .",
    "the third assumption requires mass to follow light , @xmath17 , and constant velocity ellipsoid axis ratios with radius ; @xmath18 is the surface density .",
    "the major - axis dispersion is geometrically given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is constant with radius .",
    "finally , ea , @xmath21 , completes a full set of equations for decomposition of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "data for testing of the above formalism was obtained during sparsepak commissioning ( bershady et al .",
    "2005 , see table 1 ) .",
    "both ngc 3949 and ngc 3982 were observed for @xmath22s at one ifu position with @xmath23 nm and @xmath24 or 26 km s@xmath25 .",
    "the velocity distribution function ( vdf ) of both gas and stars is parameterized by a gaussian function . in each fiber with sufficient signal - to - noise",
    ", the gaseous vdf is extracted using fits to the [ oiii ] emission line ; the stellar vdf is extracted using a modified cross - correlation method ( tonry & davis 1979 ; statler 1995 ) with hr 7615 ( k0iii ) as the template ( westfall et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the pointing of the ifu on the galaxy is determined _ post factum _ to better than 1 \" by minimizing the @xmath26 difference between the fiber continuum flux and the surface brightness profile .",
    "subsequent galactic coordinates have been deprojected according to the kinematic @xmath8 and position angle .",
    "figure 1 shows los dispersions for both the gas , @xmath27 , and stars , @xmath28 ; data points are given across the full field of the ifu with points along the major and minor axes and in between having different symbols ( see caption ) . from this figure note ( 1 )",
    "there is no significant difference in @xmath29 along the major and minor axes for ngc 3949 and ( 2 ) the large gas dispersion within @xmath30 \" for ngc 3982 is a result of poor single gaussian fits to the multiple dynamical components of its liner nucleus .",
    "figure 2 gives the folded gaseous and stellar rotation curves and compares the measured @xmath1 from figure 1 with that calculated using the formalism from  1 .",
    "the value of @xmath31 used in figure 2 provides the minimum difference between the two sets of data ( as measured by @xmath32 ; see figure 3a ) .",
    "we find @xmath33 and @xmath34 for ngc 3949 and ngc 3982 , respectively ; errors are given by 68% confidence limits .",
    "a comparison of these values to the summary in shapiro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is shown in figure 3b .",
    "the disk of ngc 3982 is similar to other sb types studied ; however , ngc 3949 seems to have an inordinately hot disk .",
    "the latter , while peculiar , is also supported by the indifference between its major and minor axis @xmath29 from figure 1 and the same indifference seen in the caii data presented by bershady et al .",
    "our streamlined velocity - ellipsoid decomposition method appears accurate , as seen by comparison with ( 1 ) galaxies of a similar type for ngc 3982 , and ( 2 ) data in a different spectral region for ngc 3949",
