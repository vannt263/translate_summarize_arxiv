    "the deep implication of a remarkable @xmath11 experiment by cplear collaboration on @xmath12 system in 1998 @xcite is not easy to explore either .",
    "we discuss these two papers in parallel in section ii before we will be able to extract some new conception about the antiparticle s wavefunction ( @xmath13 ) and momentum - energy operators .",
    "then in section iii the klein - gordon ( @xmath9 ) equation is highlighted to become a self - consistent theory in @xmath1 based on two sets of wavefunctions ( @xmath10 ) and momentum - energy operators for particle and antiparticle respectively together with a symmetry under the ( newly defined ) space - time inversion @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) or mass inversion ( @xmath14 ) which is inspired by the feshbach - villars dissociation of kg equation ( 1958 , @xcite ) .",
    "the above symmetry is further discussed and is identified with the `` strong reflection '' invariance invented by lders and pauli in their proof of the @xmath0 theorem ( 1954 - 1957 , @xcite ) in qft as well as the new definition ( @xmath6 ) for particle - antiparticle transformation proposed by lee and wu ( 1965 , @xcite ) .",
    "all discussions are combined to become a renamed symmetry for the @xmath0 invariance as @xmath3 . in section iv , the dirac equation is discussed . in section",
    "v , we discuss @xmath2 .",
    "section vi is a brief summary and discussion .",
    "the klein paradox is solved in the appendix for both @xmath9 equation and dirac equation without resorting to the `` hole theory '' .",
    "0.1 cm    to our knowledge , beginning from bohm @xcite and bell @xcite , physicists gradually turned their research of epr paradox onto the entangled state composed of electrons , especially photons with spin and achieved fruitful results .",
    "however , as pointed out by guan ( 1935 - 2007 ) , epr s paper @xcite is focused on two spinless particles and guan found that there is a commutation relation hiding in such a system as follows @xcite : + consider two particles in one dimensional space with positions @xmath16 and momentum operators @xmath17",
    ". then a commutation relation arises as @xmath18=0\\ ] ] according to qm s principle , there may be a kind of common eigenstate having eigenvalues of these two commutative ( _ i.e. _ , compatible)observables like : @xmath19 with @xmath20 being their distance .",
    "the existence of such kind of eigenstate described by eq.([2 ] ) puzzled guan , he asked : `` how can such kind of quantum state be realized ? '' a discussion between guan and one of present authors ( ni ) in 1998 led to a paper @xcite .",
    "+ here we are going to discuss further , showing that the correlation experiment on a @xmath15 system ( which just realized an entangled state composed of two spinless particles ) in 1998 by cplear collaboration @xcite actually revealed some important features of qm and then answered the puzzle raised by epr in a surprising way .",
    "first , besides eq.([1 ] ) , let us consider another three commutation relations simultaneously : @xmath21=0\\ ] ]    @xmath22 = 0\\ ] ]    @xmath23=0\\ ] ]    ( @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the time during which the",
    "_ i_th particle is detected ) . in accordance with ref.@xcite",
    ", we also focus on back - to - back events .",
    "the evolution of @xmath15 s wavefunction ( wf ) will be considered in three inertial frames : the center - of - mass system @xmath26 is at rest in laboratory with its origin @xmath27 located at the apparatus center , where the antiprotons beam is stopped inside a hydrogen gas target to create @xmath15 pairs by @xmath28 annihilation .",
    "the @xmath15 pairs are detected by a cylindrical tracking detector located inside a solenoid providing a magnetic field parallel to the antiprotons beam . for back - to - back events ,",
    "the space - time coordinates in eqs.([1])-([5 ] ) refer to particles moving to the right ( @xmath29 ) and left ( @xmath30 ) respectively .",
    "second , we take an inertial system @xmath31 with its origin located at particle 1 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath32 ) .",
    "@xmath31 is moving in a uniform velocity @xmath33 with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "( for kaon s momentum of @xmath34 ) .",
    "another @xmath35 system is chosen with its origin located at particle 2 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "@xmath35 is moving in a velocity ( @xmath37 ) with respect to @xmath26 .",

    "+ what we learn from ref.@xcite in combination with eqs.([1])-([5 ] ) are as follows : + ( a )  because only back - to - back events are involved in the @xmath26 system , we denote three commutative operators as : the `` distance '' operator @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) read @xmath66=0,\\;[\\hat{d},\\hat{b}]=0,\\;[\\hat{a},\\hat{b}]=0\\ ] ] so they may have a kind of common eigenstate during the measurement composed of @xmath50 and projected from the symmetric state shown by eq.([10 ] ) .",
    "it is assigned by a continuous eigenvalue @xmath67 ( with continuous index @xmath68 ) of operator @xmath69 acting on the wf , @xmath70 , as @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    where the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath74 is @xmath75 , and that of @xmath76 is @xmath77 respectively .",
    "these eigenstates of like - strangeness events predicted by eq.([10 ] ) are really observed in the experiment @xcite ( these eigenstates of @xmath50 were overlooked in the ref.@xcite ) .",
    "+ ( b )  the more interesting case occurs for @xmath15 pair created in the antisymmetric state with intensity given by eq.([9 ] ) being a function of @xmath78 ( not @xmath79 as shown by eq.(12 ) for symmetric states ) which is proportional to @xmath80 in the @xmath26 system . in the epr limit @xmath81 ,",
    "@xmath15 events dominate whereas like - strangeness events are strongly suppressed as shown by eq.([8 ] ) ( see fig.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "so the experimental facts remind us of the possibility that @xmath15 events may be related to common lowest ( zero ) eigenvalues of some commutative operators ( just like what happened in eqs.([14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) for operators @xmath74 and @xmath76 ( which are applied to symmetric states ( due to @xmath63 ) but are not suitable for antisymmetric states ) , there are another three operators shown by eqs.([4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) being : the operator of `` flight - path difference '' @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 with commutation relations as : @xmath85=0,\\;[\\hat{f},\\hat{g}]=0,\\;[\\hat{m},\\hat{g}]=0\\ ] ] which are just suitable for antisymmetric states . for @xmath15",
    "back - to - back events , assume that one of two particles , say 2 , is an antiparticle with its momentum and energy operators being @xmath86 ( the superscript @xmath87 means `` antiparticle '' ) just opposite in the sign to that for a particle .",
    "for instance , a freely moving particle s wf reads : @xmath88\\ ] ] whereas @xmath89\\ ] ] for its antiparticle with @xmath90 and @xmath91 being momentum and energy of the antiparticle in accordance with eq.([17 ] ) .",
    "if using eqs.([17])-([19 ] ) , we find @xmath92 with continuous index @xmath93 referring to continuous eigenvalues @xmath94 . here , the wf in space - time of this system during measurement reads approximately : @xmath95 with antiparticle 2 moving opposite to particle 1 and @xmath96 .",
    "now we use @xmath97 on @xmath15 system , yielding @xmath98    similarly , we have @xmath99 and find @xmath100 hence we see that once eqs.([17 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) are accepted , the wfs @xmath101 show up in experiments as the only wfs with strongest intensity at the epr limit ( @xmath81 ) corresponding to their three eigenvalues being all zero : @xmath102 and they wo nt change even when accelerator s energies are going up .",
    "+ if using eq.([17 ] ) , the eigenvalues of @xmath74 and @xmath76 for the wf @xmath101 are @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively , while that of @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the wf @xmath107 are @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , those eigenvalues are much higher than zero and going up with the accelerator s energy .",
    "something is very interesting here : if we deny eq.([17 ] ) but insist on unified operators @xmath110 and @xmath111 for both particle and antiparticle , there would be no difference in eigenvalues between like - strangeness events and unlike - strangeness ones .",
    "for example , the @xmath112 and @xmath113 would be @xmath114 and @xmath115 too ( instead of `` 0 '' as in eqs.([22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) ) .",
    "this would mean that three commutative operators @xmath116 and @xmath106 are not enough to distinguish the wf @xmath101 from the wf @xmath107 even they behave so differently as shown by eqs.([8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) ) , especially at the epr limit ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "+ eq.([17 ] ) together with the identification of wf @xmath101 by three zero eigenvalues implies that the difference of a particle from its antiparticle is not something hiding in the `` intrinsic space '' like opposite charge ( for electron and positron ) or opposite strangeness ( for @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) but can be displayed in their wfs evolving in space - time at the level of qm .",
    "+ to our knowledge , eq.([17 ] ) can be found at a page note of a paper by konopinski and mahmaud in 1953 @xcite , also appears in refs.@xcite .",
    "0.1 cm    let us begin with the energy conservation law for a particle in classical mechanics : @xmath119 consider the rule promoting observables into operators : @xmath120 and let eq.([44 ] ) act on a wavefunction ( wf ) @xmath121 , the schrdinger equation @xmath122 follows immediately .",
    "in mid 1920 s , considering the kinematical relation for a particle in the theory of special relativity ( sr ) : @xmath123 and using eq.([45 ] ) again , the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation was established as : @xmath124 for a free kg particle , its plane - wave solution reads : @xmath125\\ ] ] however , two difficulties arose :    \\(a ) the energy @xmath126 in eq.([49 ] ) has two eigenvalues : @xmath127 what the `` negative energy '' means ?    ( b)the continuity equation is derived from eq.([48 ] ) as @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the `` probability density '' and `` probability current density '' respectively . while the latter is the same as that derived from eq.([46 ] ) , eq.([52 ] ) seems not positive definite and dramatically different from @xmath131 in eq.([46 ] ) .    in 1958 ,",
    "feshbach and villars @xcite recast eq.([48 ] ) into two coupled schrdinger - like equations as : @xmath132      \\left(i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}-v\\right)\\chi =- mc^2\\chi+\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2(\\phi+\\chi )    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath133     \\\\[4 mm ]      \\chi=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(1+\\dfrac{1}{mc^2}v\\right)\\psi-\\dfrac{i\\hbar}{mc^2}\\dot{\\psi}\\right ]    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "interestingly , while @xmath135 , the `` probability density '' , eq.([52 ] ) can be recast into a difference between two positive - definite densities @xcite : @xmath136 for simplicity , consider a free kg particle ( @xmath137 ) with wf eq.([49 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath138 so @xmath139 and @xmath140 for @xmath141 case .",
    "but for a negative - energy ( @xmath142 ) particle , we would have @xmath143 .",
    "thus we see that the difficulty of negative probability density is intimately related to that of negative - energy .",
    "the later difficulty is actually solved in the last section by regarding the negative - energy wf of a particle directly as the positive - energy wf of its antiparticle and introducing operators as @xmath144 when these two operators act on the antiparticle s wf @xmath145,\\quad ( e_c>0)\\ ] ] the antiparticle s energy @xmath146 and momentum @xmath147 will be picked up .",
    "if substituting @xmath148 , eq.([3 - 16 ] ) , into eq.([55 ] ) to replace @xmath149 , we obtain ( after adding subscript `` c '' for antiparticle , @xmath150 and @xmath137 again ) @xmath151 now @xmath152 . to set a positive - definite probability density @xmath153 for describing the antiparticle , we need @xmath154 instead of eq.([56 ] ) for particle",
    ". however , if we directly add eq.([3 - 18 ] ) for antiparticle , this would not be a good theory .",
    "so we should have a unified prescription to get everything right for kg equation .",
    "inspecting eq.([54 ] ) carefully , we do find that it is invariant under a ( newly defined ) space - time inversion ( @xmath155 ) , _ i.e. _ , there is a hidden symmetry as follows : @xmath156 for example , space - time inversion will bring eq.([45 ] ) for particle into eq.([3 - 15 ] ) for antiparticle .",
    "meanwhile , performing eq.([3 - 19 ] ) on eq.([55 ] ) , we find @xmath157 satisfying the same equation of @xmath158 , eq.([54 ] ) , and they read : @xmath159\\\\[4 mm ] \\phi_c=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{mc^2}v\\right)\\psi_c+\\dfrac{i\\hbar}{mc^2}\\dot{\\psi}_c\\right ] \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] which is in conformity with the transformation of @xmath160 , eq.([52 ] ) , as expected : @xmath161 similarly , we have @xmath162 which , for @xmath137 case , means @xmath163 with @xmath164 along the direction of @xmath147 as expected . eq.([51 ] ) remains valid after the above transformation too .",
    "thus we see that both the `` probability density '' @xmath160 for a particle and @xmath153 for an antiparticle are positive definite before they can be normalized as expected : @xmath165 hence we see that the space - time inversion eq.([3 - 19 ] ) reflects the underlying symmetry between particle and antiparticle and overcomes two difficulties of kg equation simultaneously in an elegant way .    here , we would like to introduce a `` mass inversion '' which can realize the same symmetry of eq.([3 - 18])as follows : @xmath166 notice that , when @xmath14 , we have @xmath167 and @xmath168 for a free particle transforming into its antiparticle because the momentum and energy in their wfs are proportional to the mass in sr .",
    "the reason why @xmath169 in the space - time inversion eq.([3 - 19 ] ) whereas @xmath170 in the mass inversion eq.([3 - 25 ] ) can be seen from the classical equation : the lorentz force @xmath171 on a particle exerted by an external potential @xmath172 reads : @xmath173 .",
    "as the acceleration @xmath174 of particle will change to @xmath175 for its antiparticle , there are two alternative explanations : either due to the inversion of charge @xmath176 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath169 but keeping @xmath177 unchanged ) or due to the inversion of mass @xmath14 ( but keeping @xmath178 unchanged ) .    the reason why feshbach - villars dissociation of kg equation , eq.([54 ] ) , is so important is because they unveiled a new point of view for us to see a particle as follows :    for a free kg particle ( say , @xmath179 meson ) moving at a high speed @xmath33 , its wf @xmath180 is always composed of two fields , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , in confrontation as shown by eqs.([54 ] ) and ( [ 55 ] ) .",
    "calculations ( as can be seen from eq.([3 - 14 ] ) ) show that : as long as @xmath141 , then @xmath139 and @xmath140 , so @xmath181 dominates @xmath182 and @xmath179 remains as a particle .",
    "however , the amplitude of @xmath182 increases with the increase of particle s energy @xmath126 : when @xmath183 , but when @xmath184 , the ratio between them reads : @xmath185/[1+(1-v^2/c^2)^{1/2}]$ ] .",
    "what does this mean ?",
    "it seems to us that while @xmath181 ( hidden in @xmath149 ) characterizes the particle s property , @xmath182 represents the hidden `` antiparticle ( say , @xmath186 ) field '' in the wf of this @xmath179 particle .",
    "indeed , in eqs.([49 ] ) and ( [ 3 - 16 ] ) , the wfs of particle ( dominated by @xmath181 ) and antiparticle ( dominated by @xmath187 ) , their phase variations with respect to space - time ( keeping the same values of momentum and energy ) are just in opposite directions , meaning that the intrinsic tendencies of space - time evolution of @xmath181 and @xmath182 are also in opposite directions essentially ( see eq.([54 ] ) with @xmath137 ) . hence , even the @xmath182 is in a subordinate position in a particle , it still strives to display itself as follows : on one hand , @xmath182 holds @xmath181 back from going forward in space , so the particle s velocity @xmath33 has an upper limit value @xmath87 when @xmath188 approaches @xmath189 . and during the `` boosting '' process of a particle s wave - packet , it shows the lorentz contraction due to the entanglement between @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( see calculation shown in fig.9.5.1 of ref.@xcite ) . on the other hand , a clock attached to the particle",
    "will show the time dilatation effect in sr with the increase of velocity @xmath33 .",
    "this is because , in some sense , the `` intrinsic clock '' of @xmath190 is running clockwise ( anticlockwise ) . with the enhancement of @xmath182 , the particle s clock ,",
    "though still runs clockwise , tends to stop .",
    "therefore , it seems to us that all sr effects of a particle could be calculated and understood by the existence and enhancement of `` hidden antiparticle field '' @xmath182 inside ( for detail , please see @xcite ) .",
    "now we are going to prove that in rqm the antiparticle s wf @xmath148 obtained from the ( newly defined ) space - time inversion is coinciding with the cpt transformation of particle s wf @xmath149 , but not that from @xmath191 .",
    "as is well known , these three discrete transformations of @xmath192 and @xmath193 in rqm were defined for spinless particles separately as follows :    \\(a ) space - inversion ( @xmath194 ) :    the sign change of space coordinates ( @xmath195 ) in the wave function ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath196 may lead to two eigenstates : @xmath197 with eigenvalues @xmath198 or @xmath199 being the even or odd parity .",
    "\\(b ) time reversal ( @xmath193 ) :    the so - called @xmath193 transformation is actually not a `` time reversal '' but a `` reversal of motion '' @xcite , which implies an antiunitary operator acting on the wf : @xmath200 ( c ) charge conjugation transformation(@xmath201 ) :    the @xmath201 transformation brings a particle ( with charge @xmath202 ) into its antiparticle ( with charge @xmath203 ) and implies a complex conjugation on the @xmath13 : @xmath204 note that the @xmath13 @xmath205 implies a negative - energy particle .",
    "usually , one has to resort to so - called `` hole theory '' for electron  the vacuum is fully filled with infinite negative - energy electrons and a `` hole '' created in the `` sea '' would correspond to a positron@xcite . but how could the `` hole theory '' be applied to the boson particle ?",
    "no one knows .",
    "fortunately , at the level of rqm , if one performs the product operator cpt on a particle s wf @xmath121 , two operations of complex conjugation in the c and t will cancel each other , yielding @xcite @xmath206 on the right - side - hand ( rhs ) , the @xmath207 is just the antiparticle s wf obtained from the ( newly defined ) space - time inversion ( @xmath208 ) , eq.([3 - 16 ] ) .",
    "one may ask : is the @xmath209 in eq.([25 ] ) gives the same space - time evolution behavior of eq.([3 - 29 ] ) or eq.([3 - 16 ] ) ?",
    "the answer is `` yes '' and `` no '' .",
    "we say `` yes '' because it seems formally correct but `` no '' because it is essentially incorrect  given one set of operators like eq.([45 ] ) for both @xmath149 and @xmath209 , then the @xmath191 is a negative energy wf , which can not be accepted in physics .",
    "moreover , as we will see in the next section , for dirac equation , while the particle s wf @xmath121 and its antiparticle s @xmath210 describes the same energy and momentum , they must have opposite helicities .",
    "given the definition of c , @xmath209 is bound to fail in this aspect too .",
    "above discussions are strictly at the level of rqm .",
    "we have shown that the kg equation is really a self - sufficient and simplest model in rqm as long as the ( newly defined ) space - time inversion is introduced . as we will continue to do so in next sections ,",
    "let us write down it in a compact equation as a renamed cpt invariance : @xmath211 here , @xmath4 represent ( @xmath212 ) , _ i.e. _ , the `` strong reflection '' invented by lders and pauli ( 1954 - 1957 ) in their proof of cpt theorem at the level of qft , and @xmath6 , the newly defined particle - antiparticle transformation operator , whose definition is precisely contained in eq.([3 - 30 ] ) .    in 1965 , lee and wu proposed that@xcite : @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 represent a particle and its antiparticle . to our understanding , the physical essence of eq .",

    "dirac equation is usually written in a covariant form as ( pauli metric is used : @xmath246 , see @xcite ) : @xmath247 under a space - time ( or mass ) inversion , it turns into an equation for antiparticle : @xmath248 with an example of @xmath249 shown in eq.([73 ] ) .",
    "let us perform a representation transformation : @xmath250 and arrive at @xmath251 due to @xmath252 .",
    "since @xmath148 and @xmath249 are essentially the same in physics , ( this is obviously seen from its resolved form , eq.([68 ] ) ) , it is merely a trivial thing to change the position of @xmath187 in the 4-component spinor ( lower in eq.([79 ] ) and upper in eq.([73 ] ) ) . what important is @xmath253 for characterizing an antiparticle versus @xmath139 for a particle",
    "therefore , if a particle with energy @xmath126 runs into a potential barrier @xmath254 , its kinetic energy becomes negative , and its wf s third component in eq.([72 ] ) suddenly turns into @xmath255 , whose absolute magnitude is larger than that of the first component .",
    "this means that it is an antiparticle s wf satisfying eq.([80 ] ) ( with @xmath256 and @xmath253 ) and will be crucial for the explanation of klein paradox in dirac equation as shown in the appendix a. however , we need to discuss the `` probability density '' @xmath160 and `` probability current density '' @xmath257 for a dirac particle versus @xmath153 and @xmath164 for its antiparticle .",
    "different from that in kg equation , now we have @xmath258 which is positive definite for either particle or antiparticle . on the other hand , we have @xmath259 ( we prefer to keep @xmath223 rather than @xmath242 for antiparticle ) .",
    "for eqs.([72 ] ) , ( [ 73 ] ) and ( [ 79 ] ) , we find ( @xmath260 ) @xmath261 which means that the probability current is always along the momentum s direction for either a particle or antiparticle .    above discussions at rqm level",
    "may be summarized as follows : the first symptom for the appearance of an antiparticle is : if we perform an energy operator ( @xmath262 ) on a wf and find a negative energy ( @xmath142 ) or a negative kinetic energy ( @xmath263 ) , we d better to doubt the wf being a description of antiparticle and use the operators for antiparticle , eq.([3 - 15 ] )",
    ". then for further confirmation , two more criterions for @xmath160 and @xmath257 are needed ( see appendix ) .    in hindsight , for a linear equation in rqm , either kg or dirac equation , the emergence of both positive and negative energy ( @xmath126 ) wfs is inevitable and natural . from mathematical point of view , the set of wfs can not be complete if without taking the negative energy solutions into account . and",
    "physicists believe that these negative - energy solutions might be relevant to antiparticles . however , we physicists admit that both a rest particle s energy @xmath264 and a rest antiparticle s energy @xmath265 are positive , as verified by the experiments of pair - creation process @xmath266 .",
    "the above contradiction constructs so - called `` negative - energy paradox '' in rqm . for dirac particle ,",
    "majority ( not all ) of physicists accept the `` hole theory '' to explain the `` paradox '' . but for kg particle , no such kind of `` hole theory '' can be acceptable .",
    "it was this `` negative - energy paradox '' and `` klein paradox '' as well as the four `` commutation relations '' , eqs.([1])-([5 ] ) , hidden in the two - particle system discussed by epr @xcite gradually prompted us to realize that the root cause of difficulty in rqm lies in an a priori notion  only one kind of wf with one set of operators ( like eq.([45 ] ) ) can be acceptable in qm , either for nrqm or rqm .",
    "once getting rid of the constraint in the above notion and introducing two sets of wfs and operators for particle and antiparticle respectively , we are able to see that many difficulties in rqm disappear immediately . what we emphasize in section iii and iv is : the cpt invariance in rqm , _",
    "i.e. _ , the invariance of ( newly defined ) space - time inversion eq.([3 - 30 ] ) ( which dictates eq.([3 - 15 ] ) , @xmath153 and @xmath164 for antiparticle ) is capable of helping the rqm to become complete and more useful in applications ( see appendix a ) .",
    "0.1 cm    in qft , lders and pauli proved the cpt theorem ( refs.@xcite ) , claiming that `` a wide class of qfts which are invariant under the proper lorentz group is also invariant with respect to the product of @xmath267 and @xmath194 '' .",
    "the proof of cpt theorem contains a crucial step being the construction of so - called `` strong reflection '' , consisting in a reflection of space and time about some arbitrarily chosen origin , _ i.e. _ , @xmath268 .",
    "pauli first proposed and explained the strong reflection in @xcite as follows : when the space - time coordinates change their sign , every particle transforms into its antiparticle simultaneously .",
    "the physical sense of the strong reflection is the substitution of every emission ( absorption ) operator of a particle by the corresponding absorption ( emission ) operator of its antiparticle . and",
    "there is no need to reverse the sign of the electric charge when the sign of space - time coordinates is reversed .    after combining with other necessary postulates ,",
    "lders and pauli proved that the hamiltonian density of qft ( constructed from fields of spin zero , one - half and one by local interactions which are invariant under the proper lorentz group ) is invariant with respect to the strong reflection , @xmath269 . the strong reflection , after combining with the hermitian conjugation ( h.c . ) , turns to be identical with the product of @xmath270 and @xmath194 operations in qft , thus completing the proof of cpt theorem @xcite .",
    "hence we can rename the cpt invariance and write down eq.([3 - 30 ] ) again , but at the level of qft : @xmath271 it s time to look at the cpt theorem upside down as follows :    for a theorem , either in mathematics or in physics , its consequences are already hidden in its premises ( which are essentially beyond the proof of theorem itself ) . evidently , the premise of cpt theorem is qft , but the premise of qft had not been unveiled explicitly until 1954 - 1957 .",
    "the great merit of lders and pauli is : they discovered the premise of qft is just the invariance of the `` strong reflection''(in combination with the h.c . ) , or equivalently , the cpt invariance .",
    "in other words , why cpt theorem looks so unique is just because its consequence proves its premise exactly .",
    "we are encouraged to say so because the validity of cpt invariance , _",
    "i.e. _ , the `` strong reflection '' , has also been proved at the level of rqm in last two sections .",
    "below , we highlight pauli - lders idea to show that the `` field operator '' in qft is defined precisely in accordance with the cpt invariance , _",
    "i.e. _ , eq.([5 - 1 ] ) . what we need is some supplement added in the fock space according to pauli s idea :    let us look at the free `` field operator '' of charged scalar boson field , _ i.e. _ , the complex kg field and its hermitian conjugate being defined as ( @xmath272 ) @xmath273 + \\hat{b}^\\dag_{\\bf p}\\exp[-i({\\bf p}\\cdot{\\bf x}-et)]\\right\\}\\\\[4 mm ]     \\hat{\\psi}^\\dag({\\bf x},t)=\\sum\\limits_{\\bf p}\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2v\\omega_{\\bf p}}}\\left\\{\\hat{a}^\\dag_{\\bf p}\\exp[-i({\\bf p}\\cdot{\\bf x}-et ) ] + \\hat{b}_{\\bf p}\\exp[i({\\bf p}\\cdot{\\bf x}-et)]\\right\\ }    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] as eq.([5 - 1 ] ) works at the level of qft , we expect that eq.([5 - 2 ] ) remains invariant under the operation @xmath3 in the sense of @xmath274 indeed , it does , as long as a transformation of operators in fock space is expressed by @xcite : @xmath275 simultaneously together with the inversion of space - time coordinates ( @xmath208 ) in c - numbers wfs in eq.([5 - 2 ] ) .",
    "eqs.([5 - 2])-([5 - 4 ] ) imply that under the space - time inversion , the process of a particle s annihilation transformations into that of its antiparticle s creation ( or vice versa ) , an ansatz could be understood as a necessary implementation of eq.([5 - 1 ] ) at the level of qft and further reflects pauli s idea that the space - time inversion is indivisible from the transformation between particle and antiparticle .",
    "the commutation relation between @xmath276 and @xmath277 is assumed as usual : @xmath278=\\delta_{\\bf pp'},\\quad",
    "[ \\hat{a}_{\\bf p},\\hat{b}_{\\bf p'}]=0\\ ] ] then , performing eq.([5 - 1 ] ) on eq.([5 - 5 ] ) , we arrive at : @xmath279=\\delta_{\\bf pp'},\\quad [ \\hat{a}^\\dag_{\\bf p},\\hat{b}^\\dag_{\\bf p'}]=0\\ ] ] where eq.([5 - 4 ] ) has been used and one more rule is added as follows@xcite : the order of an operator product in fock space has to be reversed under the space - time inversion , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath280 . so is the order of a process occurred in a many - particle system under the operation eq.([5 - 1 ] ) .",
    "this is a necessary postulate ( together with the hermiticity of the hamiltonian density ) for qft being capable of dealing with real problems successfully .",
    "as qft is such a successful theory , we may expect that the wfs for a particle and its antiparticle derived from the qft will also be identified with that in the rqm .    in qft , the wf of a single particle should be defined rigorously as the nondiagonal matrix element of the relevant field operator between the vacuum state and one - particle state . for instance , assume eq.([5 - 2 ] ) to be the `` field operator of @xmath179 meson field '' , then the wf of a freely moving @xmath179 meson ( with momentum @xmath281 ) is given by @xmath282 whereas the hermitian ( _ i.e. _ , complex ) conjugation of a @xmath186 meson s wf is given by @xmath283 which leads to @xmath186 s wf being @xmath284 as expected .    similarly , the `` field operator '' for dirac field is constructed in the following form [ see @xcite .",

    "different from that for kg field , now the operators @xmath291 and @xmath300 _ etc._are assumed to obey anticommutation relations : @xmath301 which , like eqs.([5 - 5])-([5 - 6 ] ) for kg field , remain invariant under the operation of eq.([5 - 1 ] ) .",
    "however , for dirac field operator , we should define : @xmath302 \\hat{\\psi}^\\dag({\\bf x},t)\\to { \\cal p}{\\cal t}\\hat{\\psi}^\\dag({\\bf x},t)({\\cal p}{\\cal t})^{-1}=\\hat{\\psi}^\\dag(-{\\bf x},-t)(-\\gamma_5)=\\hat{\\psi}^\\dag({\\bf x},t ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] for keeping their invariance in the 4-component spinor form rigorously .",
    "thus @xmath303 which are useful for proving the `` spin - statistics connection '' by @xmath4 invariance .",
    "another rule is : one should always take the normal ordering when dealing with quadratic forms like @xmath304 _ etc . _    now , like eqs.([5 - 7])-([5 - 9 ] ) for kg particles wfs , for dirac field , we have the wf of an electron being @xmath305 but the hermitian conjugate of a positron s wf is given by @xmath306 which leads to positron s wf being @xmath307 as expected . to our surprise , we could nt find such simple derivations like eqs.([5 - 7])-([5 - 9 ] ) and eqs.([5 - 17])-([5 - 19 ] ) in existing textbooks .",
    "hence the historical merit of pauli and lders could be highlighted as follows : on one hand , what they did is actually to correct a systematic error ( `` only one set of wf and operators is allowed '' ) in rqm via the approach of qft . on the other hand , they unveiled the underlying symmetry of qft being the invariance of the hamiltonian density @xmath308 under an operation of `` strong reflection '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath309 as well as that under a h.c . :",
    "@xmath310 the validity of both eqs.([5 - 23 ] ) and ( [ 5 - 24 ] ) has been verified experimentally since the discovery of parity violation and the establishment ( and development ) of standard model in particle physics till today .",
    "0.1 cm    \\1 .",
    "since the cpt theorem was proved in the framework of qft , the cpt invariance was often discussed at the level of qft . by contrast , its discussion at the level of rqm was , to our knowledge , rarely seen .",
    "the reason might be as follows : after performing the cpt transformation on a particle s wf as eq.([3 - 29 ] ) at the level rqm , one encountered a wf with `` negative energy '' inevitably . and together with the `` negative probability density ''",
    ", no concensus could be reached on its explanation within the physics community . in our opinion ,",
    "the rqm can not be considered complete until two sets of wfs and operators are introduced for particle versus antiparticle respectively and they are linked with the ( newly defined ) space - time inversion , eq.([3 - 19 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the symmetry between particle and antiparticle can also be realized by the mass inversion ( @xmath311 ) as shown in eq.([3 - 25 ] ) at the level of rqm ( but not for qft ) .",
    "the fact that the symmetry @xmath3 exists in both rqm and qft strongly hints that it is a basic postulate in physics rather than merely a consequence of the cpt theorem .",
    "\\2 . evidently , the renamed cpt invariance , eq.([5 - 1 ] ) , discovered by lders and pauli is already there in the present framework of qft .",
    "however , one thing is important here : we should assign the helicity ( @xmath286 ) rather than the spin projection ( in space ) ( @xmath285 ) to particle s state in the expansion of field operator , eq.([5 - 10 ] ) , as required by the eq.([5 - 1 ] ) with eq.([516 ] ) .",
    "the helicity of a particle is just opposite to that of its antiparticle after the operation eq.([5 - 1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the experimental tests for the cpt invariance should include not only the equal mass and lifetime of particle versus antiparticle , but also the following fact : a particle and its antiparticle with opposite helicities must coexist in nature with no exception .",
    "a prominent example is the neutrino  a neutrino @xmath312 ( antineutrino @xmath313 ) is permanently left - handed ( right - handed ) polarized whereas the fact that no @xmath314 exists in nature must means no @xmath315 as well ( as verified by the ggs experiment @xcite ) .",
    "despite of eqs.([3 - 30 ] ) and ( [ 5 - 1 ] ) being always valid , we wish to stress that all discussions about c , p , cp and t symmetries remain meaningful regardless of being conserved or not . in particular , t always means the `` reversal of motion '' at the level of either qm or qft even though it is always an antiunitary operator .",
    "\\4 . in hindsight , after learning feshbach - villars dissociation of kg equation eqs.([54])-([55 ] ) , we realized that the postulate , _",
    "i.e. _ , the renamed cpt invariance eqs.([3 - 30 ] ) and ( [ 5 - 1 ] ) could reflect some intrinsic property of the theory of sr established by einstein in 1905 .",
    "actually , there are two lorentz invariants in the kinematics of sr : @xmath316 @xmath317 it seems quite clear that eq.([6 - 1 ] ) is invariant under the space - time inversion ( @xmath212 ) and eq.([6 - 2 ] ) remains invariant under the mass inversion ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we believe that these two discrete symmetries are deeply rooted at the sr s dynamics via its combination with qm and developing into rqm and qft  the particle and its antiparticle are treated on equal footing and linked by the symmetry @xmath3 essentially .",
    "hence , the invariance of a theory ( either in rqm or in classical physics ) under the space - time inversion or the mass inversion in one coordinate frame could be used as a tool to find or test a new equation for it being relativistic or not@xcite .",

    "unlike eq.(a.8 ) for kg equation , the probability density for dirac wf @xmath325 is positive definite ( see eq.([81 ] ) ) @xmath365 hence we will rely on two criterions : first , the probability current density and momentum must be in the same direction for either a particle or antiparticle . for @xmath366 and @xmath324 ,",

    "<S> the @xmath0 invariance has been firmly established via experimental tests . </S>",
    "<S> its theoretical implication and derivation at two levels of both relativistic quantum mechanics ( @xmath1 ) and quantum field theory ( @xmath2 ) are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> being a basic symmetry , the @xmath0 invariance can be expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represent the `` strong reflection '' , _ i.e. _ , the ( newly defined ) space - time inversion ( @xmath5 ) , invented by lders and pauli in the proof of the @xmath0 theorem and @xmath6 the new particle - antiparticle transformation proposed by lee and wu . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the renamed @xmath0 invariance , @xmath3 , could be viewed as a basic postulate being injected implicitly into the theory since the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics ( @xmath7 ) was combined with the theory of special relativity ( @xmath8 ) to become @xmath1 and then the @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the klein - gordon ( @xmath9 ) equation is highlighted to become a self - consistent theory in @xmath1 , based on two sets of wavefunctions ( @xmath10 ) and momentum - energy operators for particle and antiparticle respectively , together with the above postulate . </S>",
    "<S> hence the klein paradox for both @xmath9 equation and dirac equation can be solved without resorting to the `` hole theory '' . </S>",
