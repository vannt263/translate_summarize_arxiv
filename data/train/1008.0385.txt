    "numerous articles have been published since the early sixties concerning the problem of developing finite - time singularities by solutions of nonlinear parabolic equations ( see the survey papers of levine @xcite and of bandle and brunner @xcite ) .",
    "such problems arise in various applied fields such as combustion theory , the theory of phase separation in binary alloys , population dynamics and incompressible fluid flow .    whether or not there is a finite  time singularity , such as @xmath8 as @xmath9 , is strongly affected by the nonlinearity in the pde .",
    "for example , consider the semilinear heat equation on the line : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is real  valued . if @xmath12 then a solution of an initial value problem exists for all time .",
    "if @xmath13 , then any non - trivial solution blows up in finite time .",
    "if @xmath14 then some initial data yield solutions that exist for all time and other initial data result in solutions that have finite  time singularities .",
    "the manner in which solutions blow up is well understood computationally and analytically .",
    "the blow up is of a focussing type : there are isolated points in space around which the graph of the solution narrows and becomes taller as @xmath15 , converging to delta functions centered at the blow  up points . as @xmath15 , the behaviour of the solution near the blow  up",
    "point(s ) becomes more and more self ",
    "proving this convergence to a self  similar solution uses the maximum principle , which does nt hold for fourth  order equations like the one we study in this article .",
    "we study the longwave - unstable generalized thin film equation , @xmath16 where @xmath2 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is real valued .",
    "perturbing a constant steady state slightly , @xmath19 , and linearizing the equation about @xmath20 , the small perturbation @xmath21 will ( approximately ) satisfy @xmath22 .",
    "hence the constant steady state is linearly unstable to long wave perturbations : @xmath23    such equations arise in the modelling of fluids and materials .",
    "for example , equation ( [ a.gen.thin-film ] ) with @xmath24 describes a thin jet in a hele - shaw cell @xcite where @xmath18 represents the thickness of the jet and @xmath25 is the axial direction ; if @xmath26 and @xmath27 equation ( [ a.gen.thin-film ] ) describes van der waals driven rupture of thin films @xcite where @xmath18 represents the thickness of the film ; if @xmath28 the equation models fluid droplets hanging from a ceiling @xcite with @xmath18 representing the thickness of the film , and finally if @xmath29 and @xmath30 the equation is a modified kuramoto - sivashinsky equation and describes the solidification of a hyper - cooled melt @xcite where @xmath18 desribes the deviation from flatness of a near planar interface .",
    "we note that in the first three cases the solution @xmath18 must be nonnegative for the model to make physical sense .",
    "hocherman and rosenau @xcite considered whether or not equation ( [ a.gen.thin-film ] ) could have solutions that blow up in finite time .",
    "they conjectured that if @xmath31 then solutions might blow up in finite time but if @xmath32 they would exist for all time . indeed , this conjecture is natural if one considers the linear stability of a constant steady state @xmath20 : if @xmath33 the unstable band ( [ unstable_band ] ) grows as @xmath34 suggesting that @xmath35 is critical .",

    "specifically , they proved that given positive initial data , @xmath45 , there is a nonnegative weak solution of ( [ a.gen.thin-film ] ) that exists for all time if @xmath46 . by restricting @xmath47 further to @xmath48 they can consider nonnegative initial data , @xmath49 .",
    "they prove that there a nonnegative weak solution that exists for all time and also prove the local entropy bound needed for the finite speed of propagation proof for @xmath4 . for the critical ( @xmath50 ) regime , they prove that the above results will hold if the mass @xmath51 is sufficiently small . also , they provided numerical simulations suggesting that other initial data can result in solutions that blow up in finite time and conjectured that this is also true for the supercritical ( @xmath52 ) regime .    in @xcite , they considered equation ( [ a.gen.thin-film ] ) on the line and found some analytical results for the critical and supercritical ( @xmath53 ) regimes in the special case of @xmath54 .",
    "they introduced a large class of `` negative energy '' initial data and proved that given initial data @xmath55 with compact support and negative energy there is a nonnegative weak solution @xmath18 that blows up in finite time : there is a time @xmath56 such that the weak solution @xmath57 exists on @xmath58 and @xmath59 the blow ",
    "up time @xmath60 depends only on @xmath61 and @xmath62-norm of the initial data .",
    "we note that uniqueness of nonnegative weak solutions of ( [ a.gen.thin-film ] ) is an open problem .",
    "indeed , there are simple counterexamples to uniqueness for the simplest equation @xmath63 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) although it is hypothesized that solutions are unique if one considers the question within a sufficiently restrictive class of weak solutions .",
    "for this reason , one can not exclude the possibility that the initial data @xmath55 might also be achieved by a different weak solution , one that exists for all time .",
    "their proof relied on a second moment argument , found formally by bernoff @xcite : if @xmath18 is a smooth compactly - supported solution of ( [ a.gen.thin-film ] ) on @xmath58 then the second moment of @xmath18 satisfies @xmath64 holds for all @xmath65 . here",

    "hand side of ( [ second_moment_n1 ] ) would always be nonnegative but the right  hand side would become negative in finite time .",
    "( this argument is strictly formal because , to date , no - one has constructed nonnegative , compactly - supported , _ smooth _ solutions on the line . ) the blow - up result is found by first proving the short - time existence of a nonnegative , compactly - supported , weak solution : it exists on @xmath68 $ ] where the larger @xmath69 is , the smaller @xmath70 will be .",

    "it then follows immediately that @xmath60 must be finite and therefore the @xmath74 must be infinite .",
    "the main results of this paper are : short - time existence of nonnegative strong solutions on @xmath75 $ ] given nonnegative initial data , finite speed of propagation for these solutions if their initial data had compact support within @xmath76 , and finite - time blow - up for solutions of the cauchy problem that have initial data with negative energy .",
    "first , we consider equation ( [ a.gen.thin-film ] ) on a bounded interval @xmath75 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions",

    "additional regularity is proven in theorem [ c : th2 ] : there is a second type of entropy such that if this `` @xmath79-entropy '' is also finite for the initial data then there is a `` strong solution '' which satisfies theorem [ c : th1 ] and also has some additional regularity .",
