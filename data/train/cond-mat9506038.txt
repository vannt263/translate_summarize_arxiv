    "the electron - vibron coupled problem in c@xmath8 ions is affected by a berry phase@xcite , which is intriguing and interesting _ per se_. we have shown@xcite that the presence of a berry phase implies a number of signatures :    1 .   a @xmath9 ( @xmath6 ) ground state for c@xmath4 with odd @xmath10 , and with even @xmath10 and high spin ( @xmath11 ) , against an @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) ground state for even @xmath10 and @xmath14 ; [ gs : point ] 2 .",

    "for c@xmath1 one would also obtain in this way a clear indication of whether the ground state is @xmath11 or @xmath14 , since the spectra are very different in the two cases .",

    "this hamiltonian is derived on the basis on the icosahedral symmetry of the buckyball .",
    "the icosahedral group @xmath32 is a subgroup of the full rotation group in three dimensions @xmath33 : when reducing the symmetry from @xmath33 to @xmath32 , the representations @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 go into @xmath37 , @xmath2 and @xmath38 respectively , unsplit .",

    "linear jt coupling hides a higher - than - icosahedral symmetry , and yields states with degeneracies characteristic of the spherical group .",
    "higher order terms ( indicated with dots in eq .",
    "[ ev_hamiltonian ] : we neglect them in the present treatment ) would split these degeneracies into the appropriate @xmath32 representations . for this reason",
    ", we use a hybrid notation , and label states with icosahedral or spherical representations , according to convenience",
    ".    the unperturbed frequencies @xmath39 of the eight @xmath3 modes of neutral c@xmath8 are experimentally well - known ( see table i ) .",
    "@xmath12 modes do not split the @xmath2 level , and are not included in this calculation .",

    "if needed , corrections can be made using , e.g. , the shifted frequencies calculated in solid state a@xmath40c@xmath8 by andreoni and collaborators@xcite . the dimensionless jt coupling parameters @xmath41 are more uncertain .",
    "here we shall adopt the recent values empirically extracted by gunnarsson@xcite by fitting photoemission spectra of c@xmath42 in gas phase .    in an earlier work@xcite , we diagonalized hamiltonian ( [ ev_hamiltonian ] ) both approximately , using perturbation theory ( where all modes can be superposed linearly ) , and numerically , including however a single vibrational mode .",
    "subsequently gunnarsson calculated the ground state energy accurately , including all modes@xcite .    here , aiming at gas phase spectroscopy , we shall diagonalize ( [ ev_hamiltonian ] ) accurately , including all modes , and we shall obtain in addition the lowest excitation spectrum as well , for @xmath10=1 and 2 electrons .",

    "[ state ] extends to states with any number of vibrons , but a linear e - v coupling implies decay as @xmath46 of components with @xmath47-vibron states , for large enough @xmath47 .",
    "for this reason , a truncated basis set including all states up to @xmath47 vibrons gives a variational estimate of the lowest eigenvalues , with hopefully good convergence with increasing @xmath47 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the hamiltonian matrix elements on the truncated basis .",
    "this matrix is sparse , involving nonzero terms only between states whose numbers of vibrons differ by exactly one .",
    "as mentioned above , the approximate hamiltonian ( [ ev_hamiltonian ] ) has full rotational symmetry .",

    ", we list the size @xmath53 of the truncated hilbert space at different values of @xmath47 , for @xmath50 .",
    "the structure of the problem is suitable for a lanczos algorithm .",
    "our computational resources allow us to solve such a problem for @xmath54 , thus including up to @xmath55 vibrons .",

    "we have restricted this calculation to the lowest 5 - 6 eigenvalues , covering excitation energies only up to 400 - 500 @xmath57 .",
    "this is the region where the results are more reliable , within the limits imposed by the residual uncertainties in the coupling constants @xmath41 . at higher excitation energies ,",
    "multi - mode combinations make the spectrum increasingly dense , and unreliable .",
    "moreover , the lanczos algorithm , as implemented , is unsuitable for computing accurately a large number of excited levels .",
    "the predicted excitation spectrum of gas phase @xmath15c@xmath42 and @xmath16c@xmath1 within the linear coupling spherical approximation ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ( a ) , and is reported in table ii .",
    "the four lowest excitations are essentially derived from the @xmath58 mode at 270@xmath57 , which is split in a qualitatively similar manner as predicted by perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "the numerical value of the splitting which we find here is rather large , and should be readily observable in future raman or eels spectroscopy , if feasible , in gas phase .",
    "the lowest excitation is confirmed to be the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) doublet near 200 @xmath57 .",
    "as discussed above this doublet will in reality be split by higher order , nonspherical terms , absent in the hamiltonian ( [ ev_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "however , we expect that the nonspherical splitting should be rather small relative to that to the next @xmath59 state ( @xmath60 70 @xmath57 ) . experimental confirmation of the overall `` @xmath18 '' nature of the lowest excitation doublet would provide an interesting check for the berry phase in c@xmath42 .",
    "below 300 @xmath57 the remaining excitations ( @xmath59 , @xmath9 ) retain a prevalent @xmath61 character .    above the @xmath61-derived multiplet , the next @xmath18 excitation , near 357 @xmath57 , has largely @xmath62 character , but there is also admixture with @xmath63 components .",
    "we note that there are no low - lying @xmath13 states .",
    "it is interesting that among all @xmath47-vibron states , only those which involve _ different _ @xmath3 modes can give rise to an overall @xmath13 state .",
    "the lowest @xmath13 state is expected to originate from the coupling with states belonging to @xmath64 , while none is originated from a pure overtone , such as @xmath63 .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "since the bare electronic state is @xmath6 , we need another @xmath6 ( of vibrational nature ) to get an overall @xmath13 . in the combinations of two different @xmath7 vibrons ,",
    "@xmath65 states are generated , and these contain an @xmath6 ( @xmath66 ) state . for two ( or more ) _ identical _ vibrons , however , only @xmath67 are generated , the odd states vanishing due to permutation symmetry .",
    "hence , there is no @xmath6 in the overtones , and no overall @xmath13 .",
    "we expect , accordingly , the lowest @xmath13 state at @xmath60700 @xmath57 , close to the c@xmath8 @xmath68 origin . in the icosahedral group , however this kind of state will have @xmath69 symmetry .",
    "conversely , @xmath12 states can only be generated by involving `` @xmath70 '' vibrons .",
    "but these are linearly uncoupled to the electronic state , and thus very hard to excite .",
    "thus it is confirmed that an approaching s - wave electron can not efficiently attach to the c@xmath8 molecule and end up ( at least for the @xmath2 orbital ) in a global @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) state@xcite .    the predicted low - lying excitation spectrum of a hypothetical gas phase @xmath20c@xmath1 is given in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ( b ) , and in table iii .",
    "convergence is in this case much more problematic than for @xmath22 , or @xmath23 , @xmath11 .",
    "there is a new feature , consisting in a crossing of levels ( of different symmetry ) , upon increasing @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ convergence ] ( b ) ) . for these reasons , error - bars on the extrapolated values",
    "are larger , probably exceeding 10 @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath22 case discussed above , for @xmath23 , @xmath14 not all the lowest excitations can be classified as derived mainly from the lowest vibrational mode @xmath58 .",
    "the 6 two - electron @xmath14 states with no vibrons are split by e - v coupling into @xmath71 vibronic states .",
    "the singlet ground state is @xmath72 , and the @xmath73 state is left as a low - lying excitation . in the weak coupling limit",
    "its energy goes to zero as @xmath74 ( see fig.5 in ref.@xcite ) . for finite coupling ,",
    "contributions to this excitation wave function come simultaneously from all @xmath3 modes , and are not dominated by lowest mode @xmath75 , unlike , e.g. , the lowest @xmath18 excitation of @xmath16c@xmath1 . if @xmath58 were the only mode coupled to the @xmath2 orbital , then the predicted excitation energy for this lowest @xmath7 state , would be 69.9 @xmath57 .",
    "the energy we find when all the modes are included ( table iii ) is significantly smaller , approximately 40@xmath57 , confirming the participation of all modes .",
    "the next higher excitations are an @xmath76 state ( unsplit doublet @xmath77 ) , followed by an @xmath78 , @xmath7 and @xmath18 , all essentially of @xmath58 origin .",
    "this sequence constitutes a clear remnant of the para - hydrogen - like series @xmath79 predicted semiclassically when the berry phase cancels , as in this case .",
    "the first level originating from @xmath80 is , as expected , a state of symmetry @xmath76 around 330 @xmath57 above the ground state , identically beginning another series @xmath81 .",
    "it should be noted here that icosahedral splittings ( not included ) are probably larger in this case relative to @xmath22 .",
    "the pure jt energetics ( see table ii and iii ) indicates the spin singlet configuration as the preferred ground state of c@xmath1 .",
    "however our calculation does not include coulomb e - e repulsion , which is not negligible in this state .",
    "there is in fact some experimental evidence@xcite that c@xmath1 ions in a matrix may prefer an @xmath11 configuration , as expected from hund s rule . the reduction of screening in vacuum could imply an even stronger coulomb repulsion , further favoring an @xmath11 ground state .",
    "it should be noted however that large @xmath82 hubbard models , as well as ppp calculations appear to favor a singlet ground state for @xmath23 , even without jt effect@xcite . on the other hand , the dynamical jt effect of the ion when in a matrix is likely to be quenched ( by crystal fields or by polarization of the surrounding medium ) to a static jt distorsion , which gains considerably less energy than the dynamic jt effect considered here@xcite .",
    "this leaves open a residual chance of a @xmath20c@xmath1 ground state in gas phase .",
    "we stress here finally , that our spectra have been computed neglecting spin - orbit effects .",
    "since the intra - carbon spin - orbit coupling is @xmath83 @xmath57@xcite , it can be expected to yield additional splittings , both in the ground state and the low lying excitations , of comparable magnitude .",
    "splittings of 30 and 75 @xmath57 reported in the near ir spectrum of c@xmath42 in solid ar have in fact been attributed to spin - orbit@xcite .",
    "interpretation of the actual spectra of c@xmath42 and c@xmath1 will have to include consideration of spin - orbit effects , to be calculated in the future .",
    "we have calculated the lowest excitation spectrum , derived by jt coupling of the @xmath3 modes for c@xmath42 and c@xmath1 in gas phase .",
    "the calculation involves neglecting nonspherical and nonlinear effects , as well as spin - orbit coupling , but is otherwise fully quantitative .",
    "common characters of these spectra are sizable splittings , in the order of several tens of @xmath57 , and a substantial lowering of the transition energy to the lowest mode , in comparison with the lowest @xmath3 mode of neutral c@xmath8 .",
    "the symmetry of this lowest excitation , in particular , should be revealing in connection with the berry phase which affects this jahn - teller problem@xcite .",
    "gas phase vibron spectroscopy of these negative ions will be very important in the future , to check these predictions .",
