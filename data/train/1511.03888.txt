    "the frequencies of the cs clock and the sr lattice clock have been compared via femtosecond - frequency combs ( fs in fig .",
    "[ fig : network ] ) . a continuously operated , high - performance hydrogen maser ( vremya - ch vch-1003 m ) used as a flywheel is connected to both clocks , e.g. for the generation of a time - scale steered by either the cs fountain clock ( ts(cs ) , @xcite ) or the lattice clock ( ts(sr ) ) . during the measurement campaign , the lattice clock was operated over a total up - time of @xmath12  s ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( b ) ) , together with the almost continuously running fountain clock ( availability @xmath13 ) .    from this simultaneous comparison of the cs and the sr clock with the maser , the lattice clock s frequency can be calculated in the si unit hertz as realized by the cs fountain clock . for white frequency noise , which is the dominating noise type in atomic frequency standards , the statistical clock uncertainty for a given averaging time @xmath8 is equal to the allan deviation @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "thus , the fountain clock s instability @xmath15/@xmath7 clearly dominates the statistical uncertainty of the measurement given by @xmath16 .",
    "however , using only the joint up - times of both clocks does not make any use of the information available from the maser : its frequency is more stable than the fountain s for periods of up to @xmath17  s and can be measured accurately even during short up - times of the lattice clock .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to take the maser frequency value measured with the sr clock as representative for longer intervals to improve @xmath18 .    in general ,",
    "due to the maser instability there is a potential difference between the maser frequency averaged over time @xmath19 and an extended time @xmath20 .",

    "this situation is not particular to optical clocks @xcite , but nowadays prevalent when time - scales are established in metrology institutes or contributing to utc @xcite . in the following",
    ", we consider the combination of the sr lattice clock and the continuously running maser flywheel to constitute a time - scale based on an optical clock .",
    "the main difference to the absolute frequency measurement is that now we are not free to chose the extended time interval @xmath20 since it is determined by the time - scale s origin and the duration for which the time - scale has to be provided . for convenience",
    ", we will discuss an optical time - scale that covers the 12 days of our flywheel - assisted absolute frequency measurement campaign .",
    "the predictability of a time - scale is quantified by its uncertainty : the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : stab ] ( a ) shows the frequency uncertainty @xmath31 of an ensemble of masers  all having the same instability like our maser  whose frequencies are extrapolated from @xmath19 to a period @xmath20 ( red line ) .",
    "the curve can be related to an accumulated time - scale uncertainty via @xmath32 when realizing a time - scale by correcting such maser s frequency by interrupted measurements with our optical clock . to yield the overall optical time - scale uncertainty",
    ", this contribution has to be added in quadrature to the accumulated time uncertainty of the sr clock s scale unit , which is at least an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "we choose a numerical approach in order to demonstrate the potential performance of a real - time steered time - scale ts(sr ) during the measurement interval of interest since an experimental characterization would suffer from the instability of available reference time - scales .",
    "ts(sr ) is compared to the uncertainty of a theoretical time - scale ts(cs ) based on a cs reference with 100  % up - time ( assuming the parameters of ptb s fountain clock csf2 ) . in order to provide time whenever needed we choose a real - time implementation even though it bears tougher constraints , which can result in a degraded instability compared to a post - processing approach . in general , the steering algorithm can be optimized with respect to a stable scale unit and a good long - term performance .",
    "both design goals coincide for 100  % clock up - time but they diverge the longer the clock down - times are that must be bridged with a less stable flywheel . for ts(sr ) we focus on a low statistical uncertainty for long averaging times to reach the clock s systematics as quickly as possible .    to estimate the error of ts(sr ) , we numerically generate frequency data traces on a 10  s grid for the maser flywheel and the sr clock using the time intervals of fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( c ) . while the clock trace accounts for the statistical noise @xmath33 , the maser trace reflects the noise and drift characteristics of our maser model ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : meth ] ) .",
    "this data is used to simulate a time - scale ts(sr ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stab ]  ( d ) , starting with the first corrected period ) . at the beginning of the measurement interval",
    "( @xmath34 corresponds to the modified julian date ( mjd ) @xmath35 ) , the time error @xmath36 between the time - scale and an ideal one is set to zero .",
    "the steering algorithm works as follows : the average maser frequency is calculated regularly using the frequency information available up to that point from the sr clock .",
    "this regular period is chosen to one hour .",
    "the average @xmath37 is used as estimate for the maser frequency @xmath38 over the full elapsed time @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding time error is applied to the phase stepper in fig .",
    "[ fig : network ] to correct the time - scale from the maser as @xmath40 . to attain a complete picture",
    ", one also has to account for the sr clock s systematics @xmath10 .",
    "this is achieved by setting off the fractional clock frequency from its ideal value by @xmath41 , which results in a minor time error of about 15  ps over the 12 days .",
    "we observe a very stable behaviour of ts(sr ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( d ) ) ; it is rather smooth and no excursions larger than 150  ps are observed .",
    "the initial transient response at day 2 is an artefact of the initialization of the real - time time - scale and could be reduced considerably in post - processing . between day 6 and 9 , when no data from the lattice clock is available , ts(sr ) starts to deviate according to the free - running maser instability , but once there is new optical data available ( @xmath42  days ) the time offset does not increase further and is even reduced due to a improved estimate of the past maser average frequency .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( d ) shows uncertainty bands of independent time - scale realizations of ts(sr ) and ts(cs ) as shaded areas including statistical and systematic contributions . in case of ts(sr ) , the statistical uncertainty connected to the interrupted optical clock operation @xmath43 is calculated by the method described above , applying a weighting function that reflects the elapsed time and up - time of the optical clock . in this case",
    ", @xmath43 is not insensitive to a linear drift of the flywheel for all times and thus an uncertainty contribution considering this fact is added in quadrature . however , in a real operation scenario the drift is usually known , e.g. from long - term comparisons against utc , and can easily be corrected . for the considered 12-days period , the uncertainty of ts(sr ) is below 200  ps at all times . while the overall uncertainty of ts(cs ) is dominated by the reference clock s systematics , that of ts(sr ) is dominated by @xmath43 .",
    "thus , with increasing optical clock availability the uncertainty of ts(sr ) would be further reduced . yet , even with the optical clock operation periods at hand , which can be considerably increased for the realization of a time - scale , the uncertainty of ts(sr ) is clearly below that of the traditional time - scale at all relevant times .",
    "moreover , the uncertainty of ts(cs ) is increasing much faster .",
    "the formalism presented here is applicable to arbitrary flywheel - assisted clock measurement scenarios .",
    "therefore , it allows assessing the scaling of the time errors for longer measurements .",
    "for example , when hypothetically providing ts(sr ) for a longer interval by repeating the measurement campaign illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ]  ( c ) in a similar way , both campaigns can be considered statistically independent and , thus , the overall time error essentially increases with the square - root of the combined campaigns total duration @xmath44 and correspondingly the statistical extrapolation uncertainty of the average frequency scales with @xmath45 .",
    "this paper demonstrates that optical frequency standards and in particular strontium lattice clocks have reached a maturity that they now can be used in combination with a high - quality commercially available flywheel oscillator to generate a time - scale that shows beyond state - of - the - art performance .",
    "this is essential for actual optical clock applications and a redefinition of the si - unit second .",
    "the measurement presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ]  ( b ) did not explicitly aim for maximum up - time and can therefore be regarded a lower limit of capability of our apparatus . yet , fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( d ) shows that a time error of below 200  ps was achieved for a measurement interval of 12  days .",
    "continuation of the campaign would have led to a time error of about 300  ps over 30  days , the typical comparison duration to establish utc .",
    "this is a remarkably low value in view of the deviations in the ns - range between the best time - scales reported in the monthly circular - t @xcite , which , however , includes an additional time link error of about @xmath46  ns .",
    "concerning the flywheel oscillator , several choices are available besides the h - maser used here to achieve lower scale unit distortions for certain gap durations .",
    "cryogenic sapphire microwave oscillators @xcite , cryogenic optical reference resonators @xcite , and lasers stabilized by the method of spectral hole burning @xcite show excellent mid- and long - term stability and could serve this purpose .",
    "even an optical clock that is optimized for reliability instead of accuracy can be envisaged .",
    "ultimately , an ensemble of flywheels is conceivable providing lowest instability for all occurring gap durations .    today",
    "s satellite - based comparison techniques can readily provide time - scale comparisons with uncertainties below 1  ns @xcite .",
    "thus , having averaged for a year or more , the well - established satellite network would allow the intercontinental comparison of flywheel - assisted optical clocks in the low @xmath47 regime .",
    "even further , esa s future space mission atomic clock ensemble in space ( aces ) will provide enhanced frequency comparison capabilities over intercontinental distances @xcite , such that flywheel - supported optical clock comparisons will no longer be limited by the satellite link between them .",
    "thus , intercontinental clock comparisons with uncertainty in the @xmath48 regime after averaging over a month is within reach .",
    "the current optical clocks can be developed towards mostly autonomous systems that will increase the average availabilities @xcite .",
    "for example , a clock availability of 70  % would immediately improve the time - scale uncertainty further to below 50  ps over 30  days assuming our system and a worst - case - scenario of a single 7  h interruption per day , which corresponds to a frequency uncertainty of @xmath49 .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> optical clocks are not only powerful tools for prime fundamental research , but are also deemed for the re - definition of the si base unit second as they surpass the performance of caesium atomic clocks in both accuracy and stability by more than an order of magnitude . however , an important obstacle in this transition has so far been the limited reliability of the optical clocks that made a continuous realization of a time - scale impractical . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate how this dilemma can be resolved and that a time - scale based on an optical clock can be established that is superior to one based on even the best caesium fountain clocks . </S>",
    "<S> the paper also gives further proof of the international consistency of strontium lattice clocks on the @xmath0 accuracy level , which is another prerequisite for a change in the definition of the second .    </S>",
    "<S> the international system of units ( si ) is the universal base for all measurements and thus constitutes the backbone of natural sciences and engineering . </S>",
    "<S> the definitions themselves and their realizations have been adapted over the years to profit from state - of - the - art research results . </S>",
    "<S> important modifications are at hand for the electrical units and the mass , which will be defined through agreed - upon values of fundamental constants @xcite . due to their impressive progress @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , optical clocks surpass caesium fountain clocks , which currently realize the si - second with lowest uncertainty , in terms of stability and accuracy of the frequency realizations of the unperturbed atomic transition . </S>",
    "<S> this has caused discussion about the need for a re - definition of this unit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a first step has been the acknowledgement of suitable optical transitions in neutral atoms and ions as secondary representations of the si unit `` second '' by the commit international des poids et mesures ( cipm ) @xcite .    given the outstanding role of the si , it is of paramount importance that adaptations must be prepared carefully . </S>",
    "<S> hence , changes will be acceptable only if @xcite    * an obvious candidate is identified , * the transition is smooth , and * the new approach is practical .    </S>",
    "<S> while the first point stimulates ongoing research , the second point has already been addressed satisfactorily for strontium optical lattice clocks @xcite by measurements of the strontium clock transition frequency with today s best possible accuracy ; the results in this paper confirm the previous measurement results . </S>",
    "<S> the latter prerequisite , however , has not been achieved so far for the candidate systems as existing optical clocks have generally been considered less reliable and thus less suitable for the actual implementation of a practical time - scale , which continuously accumulates the atomic seconds .     </S>",
    "<S> is used to correct the classical time - scale ts(cs ) generated from the maser utilizing a phase stepper ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> an equivalent scheme is applicable when referencing the time - scale ts(sr ) to an optical frequency standard . </S>",
    "<S> for that purpose , the clock laser light is down - converted to the microwave regime using a femtosecond frequency comb ( fs ) before comparing against the flywheel . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , both maser offsets can be analysed to yield the sr clock frequency in si units . ]    </S>",
    "<S> time - scales provide us with coordinates for the position of events in time , much like a coordinate system does for the positioning in space . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it needs to be realized without interruption to provide a continuous coordinate or to measure time intervals and to synchronize distant events . </S>",
    "<S> today , the universal coordinated time - scale utc is post - processed from a weighted monthly average of the time kept by some 400 microwave atomic clocks around the world that are intercompared via satellite links . to obtain time whenever needed , </S>",
    "<S> the time labs generate local time - scales in real - time typically by steering the output frequency of a continuously running flywheel oscillator ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : network ] ) , e.g. a hydrogen maser , on a monthly period to stay synchronized with the utc clock ensemble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some time labs synchronize their flywheel oscillators on an even shorter period to match the frequency of a local primary cs clock @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the time error of such real - time time - scales with respect to an ideal time - scale is twofold : first , the accuracy of the local scale unit is limited by imperfections of the atomic reference(s ) . even for the best caesium fountain clocks this error can integrate to about 1  ns after one month . </S>",
    "<S> second , missing information from utc or down - times of the local atomic reference clock introduce a time error depending on the instability of the flywheel oscillator .    due to the averaging , utc is more stable than most local time - scales . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in practice the quality of a local time - scale is typically assessed by comparing to utc , which , however , is not an ideal reference . </S>",
    "<S> due to its construction , a deviation between the rate of utc and the second of the local fountains can be as large as 0.1  ns / day , which accumulates to a time error of about 3  ns at the end of the month .    </S>",
    "<S> optical clocks are expected to be capable of reducing the time error of a likewise realized local time - scale by more than one order of magnitude ( time @xmath2  ps after a month )  provided the time error arising from their down - times is limited to an acceptable level  and thus significantly improve the time - scale s predictability . </S>",
    "<S> together with improved time link technologies @xcite , a network of optical atomic clocks will allow the generation of a much more stable utc and thus labelling events in time all over the world more precisely . </S>",
    "<S> this would be beneficial for global navigation systems , astro- and fundamental physics .    in this article , we demonstrate how ptb s strontium lattice clock is now able to maintain a local time - scale with a time error of less than 200  ps compared to an ideal reference over about 12 days , or @xmath3 in fractional units . over this period </S>",
    "<S> , the optical clock is allowed to operate with long interruptions ( overall clock availability : @xmath4 ) , and down - times are bridged by a hydrogen maser flywheel . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion of the scale unit due to the use of the flywheel while the clock is offline causes the dominant contribution to the achieved residual time error . yet </S>",
    "<S> , this shows for the first time that already today optical frequency standards with limited availability can actually serve as atomic references to support a local time - scale over extended periods , yielding a long - term performance better than of the ones referenced to the best current microwave clocks even if they are operated free of interruptions . </S>",
    "<S> further improvements of the time - scale based on an optical clock are at hand by ever higher availability of the optical clock </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the maser - flywheel - assisted sr data together with data from one of our cs fountains acquired in parallel enabled us to measure the sr clock transition frequency with minimum uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> so far this could only be achieved by operating the clocks for long times and/or by averaging over several of the best fountain clocks @xcite . </S>"
