    "stochastic equations of motion and theirs generalizations are extensively used in different contexts , e.g. in classical statistical mechanics to study systems with dissipation and noise , to determine how order parameters equilibrate , in critical phenomena dynamics , among many other problems @xcite .",
    "the simplest case of a stochastic equation of motion is the phenomenological langevin equation describing e.g. the brownian motion .",
    "it consists of local ( markovian ) dissipation and noise terms , which are related to each other through the classical fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "memory effects are then neglected . however ,",
    "in real systems scattering events responsible to dissipation and fluctuations proceed through finite time intervals , which , consequently , result in finite memory effects for these quantities .",
    "the typical equations of motion describing real physical systems are then expected to be nonlocal ( i.e. , non - markovian ) ones with memory effects .",
    "an equation of this type is given by a generalized langevin equation ( gle ) of motion of the form ( for a general reviews , see e.g. ref .",

    "( [ genlangevin ] ) are also known as caldeira - leggett type of models @xcite .",
    "applications making use of equations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ genlangevin ] ) must be able to properly deal with the memory kernel . in some restrict cases , like in the most common forms of non - markovian kernels used in the literature ,",
    "e.g. when the dissipation kernel @xmath3 , describes an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process  @xcite or in the case of the exponential damped harmonic ( edh ) kernel  @xcite , it is possible to reduce the non - markovian equation into a set of markovian ones with white noise properties . in other generic cases , however , this may not always be possible ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on the different colored noises and associated equations used in the literature ) . in these and any other cases dealing for example , with nonlinear equations",
    ", we must resort to numerical methods .",
    "though there are some specific numerical methods that may be applicable for general cases @xcite , we still would like to be able to solve equations like eq .",
    "( [ genlangevin ] ) through standard methods , which are less numerically expensive than other alternatives . analytically , if the equation is linear , then it is , in principle , possible to solve equations like eq .",
    "( [ genlangevin ] ) through a laplace transform , since the dissipation integral term in eq .",
    "( [ genlangevin ] ) is just in the form of a convolution .",
    "even so , in these cases we can only look at averaged ( over the noise ) quantities .",
    "in addition , if it is nonlinear , i.e. , when the potential term @xmath2 is a polynomial form of order larger than two in @xmath1 , then we must resort to numerical methods in order to solve the differential stochastic equation of motion . in the cases",
    "it can be reduced to a set of local differential equations with white noise , like in the ou and edh cases mentioned above , the most natural way for solving the system of differential equations would be e.g. , through a standard runge - kutta method , which is both easy to implement and usually produces results with good accuracy . however , since the standard runge - kutta method is basically a deterministic algorithm , when applied to a stochastic differential equation with white noise , it becomes not well defined , since the white noise term has infinite variance and , therefore , can not be generated . in order to deal with this problem ,",
    "stochastic runge - kutta routines have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "an issue related to applying such techniques to solve systems of differential equations is that not all equations may be stochastic , but only a sub - set of them . in cases like these",
    ", those algorithms may not be suitable or appropriate .    in this work",
    "our objective is to investigate both analytically and numerically the solutions of non - markovian linear equations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ genlangevin ] ) and then compare their results . in doing so , we are able to gauge the reliability and precision of numerically solving the stochastic non - markovian equations by standard numerical codes , e.g. , runge - kutta codes for solving differential equations . for this",
    ", we use the most common forms for the dissipation kernel @xmath3 given by the ou and edh forms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the solution of the linear gle through laplace transform . in section 3",
    ", we show the transformation of the gles of motion with ou and edh kernels in systems of markovian time differential equations with white noise . in section 4 ,",
    "we show the comparison of the results obtained for the analytical solutions for the linear equations with those obtained numerically within our prescription to make then local , from a standard fourth - order runge - kutta code .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present our conclusions and final comments about the precision of numerically solving the equations with standard numerical methods .",
    "since non - markovian equations like eq .",
    "( [ genlangevin ] ) have nonlocal kernel terms in the form of a convolution , they become suitable to be solved by laplace transform .",

    "we here have used the _ maple _ software to numerically evaluate for @xmath21 . it should be noted that in the ou and edh cases the explicit forms for the solutions can be obtained by _ maple _ , but they are too complicated and long solutions , so we refrain ourselves here to write them down explicitly .",

    "( [ setou ] ) and ( [ setedh2 ] ) , and they produce identical results . the main difference between the two prescriptions being the fact that the latter requires some extra care in its numerical implementation . since the function @xmath55 , as defined by eq .",

    "( [ avphi2 ] ) , with the numerical results for this same quantity .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the ou ( left panel ) and edh ( right panel ) cases , respectively .    from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we again see an excellent agreement between the results obtained for @xmath61 analytically and numerically .",
    "how good is this agreement between analytical and numerical results in both cases can also be better assessed by defining the difference between them , i.e. ,    @xmath62    the results for the differences @xmath63 and @xmath64 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , respectively , for the ou and edh cases .",
    "we note from the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] that the differences are allways smaller than about @xmath65 and oscillates around zero in a noisy way .",
    "in fact we have checked that most of this difference is purely due to noise and can be decreased by increasing the number of realizations over the noise .",
    "this certifies that the solution from the standard fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm for the system of differential equations ( [ setou ] ) and ( [ setedh ] ) is reproducing quite well the analytical results , despite the initial non - deterministic character of the gle .",
    "the agreement is seen both at short times , where the memory effects dominate , but also at long times , where it becomes sub - dominant and where the local approximation with dissipation eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) can better represent the dynamics @xcite .",
    "we think that the overall error observed between the analytical and numerical results can probably be made even smaller with an improved code , like for example by using a stochastic runge - kutta one [ 8 ] . however , we were not able to fully verify it for the particular cases of stochastic differential equations studied here , since its use would mean solving all equations in ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) , or ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) , the same form , which seems not appropriate , since they are not all stochastic .",
    "we hope to better discriminate this problem in a future work , where a variation of the runge - kutta code is in test to be used in situations like these .",
    "in this work we have studied the reliability of using standard numerical codes to solve generalized langevin equations . in this study",
    "we have used a standard fourth - order runge - kutta routine to solve for the generated system of local first - order differential equations .",
    "we have shown that the solution for the linear equation of motion obtained from the use of a laplace transform , when contrasted with the numerical solution are in very good agreement and the use of these standard numerical methods can lead to a reliable description of the stochastic dynamics , independent of the form of the prescription used to transform the original generalized langevin equation in a system of local differential equations .",
    "we have studied the two most used cases of dissipation / noise kernels , the ou and edh cases .",
    "we have observed that the results between the analytical and numerical ones agree with each other with very good numerical precision .",
    "we expect that the numerical precision can be made even better by using variations of a stochastic rung - kutta code , appropriately tailored to deal with systems of local differential equations like the ones we here have studied .",
    "work in this direction is in progress and we hope to report on the results in a future publication .",
    "though we have studied in this work only the ou and edh non - markovian cases , our results are expected to be of importance for the practical study of other different generalized langevin equations through numerical methods , which is the case in most situations , like when including nonlinear effects in the equations . in those cases ,",
    "once a proper prescription is used to transform these equations , our results show that standard numerical methods for solving differential equations can be applied to obtain reliable results for the dynamics at both short and long times",
