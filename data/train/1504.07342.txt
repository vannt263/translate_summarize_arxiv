    "game theory , the science of strategic decision making pioneered by john von neumann ( see von neumann , j. & morgenstern , o. , 1953 ) , has wide real - world applications in many fields , including economics , biology , computer science and engineering . the nash equilibrium , named after john forbes nash , jr , is a fundamental concept in game theory .",
    "the existence and computing of nash equilibria are two central problems in the theory of games . for two - player zero - sum games ,",
    "von neumann proved the existence of mixed - strategy equilibria using brouwer fixed point theorem .",
    "nash proved that if mixed strategies are allowed , then every game with a finite number of players and strategies has at least one nash equilibrium ( nash , 1951 ) .",
    "although pure strategies are conceptually simpler than mixed strategies , it is usually difficult to guarantee the existence of a pure - strategy equilibrium . however , it is shown that every finite potential game possesses a pure - strategy nash equilibrium ( monderer & shapley , 1996 ) .",
    "the concept of potential game was proposed by rosenthal(1973 ) .",
    "a game is said to be a potential game if it admits a potential function .",
    "the incentive of all players to change their strategy can be expressed by the difference in values of the potential function .",
    "for a potential game , the set of pure - strategy nash equilibria can be found by searching the maximal values of the potential function .",
    "an important problem is how to check whether a game is a potential game .",
    "monderer and shapley ( 1996 ) first proposed necessary and sufficient conditions for potential games .",
    "but it is required to verify all the simple closed paths with length @xmath0 for any pair of players .",
    "then hino ( 2011 ) gave an improved condition for detecting potential games , which has a lower complexity than that of monderer and shapley ( 1996 ) due to that only the adjacent pairs of strategies of two players need to check .",
    "in ui ( 2000 ) , it is proved that a game is potential if and only if the payoff functions coincide with the shapley value of a particular class of cooperative games indexed by the set of strategy profiles .",
    "game decomposition is an important method for potential games ( candogan , menache , ozdaglar , & parrilo , 2011 ; hwang , & rey - bellet 2011 ; sandholm , 2010 ) and some new necessary and sufficient conditions for detecting potential games are obtained .",
    "sandholm ( 2010 ) established connections between his results and that in ui ( 2000 ) .",
    "but the number of the obtained verification equations is not the minimum . in sandholm ( 2010 ) , it is proved that a finite game is a potential game if and only if , in each of the component games , all active players have identical payoff functions , and that in this case , the potential function can be constructed .",
    "recently , cheng ( 2014 ) developed a novel method , based on the semi - tensor product of matrices , to deal with games including potential games , networked games and evolutionary games ( cheng , 2014 ; cheng , xu & qi , 2014 ; cheng , xu , he , qi , 2014 ; cheng , he , qi , & xu , 2015 ; guo , wang , & li , 2013 ) . in cheng ( 2014 ) , a linear system , called potential equation , is proposed , and then it is proved that the game is potential if and only if the potential equation is solvable . with a solution of the potential equation , the potential function can be directly calculated .",
    "a natural question is how to establish the connection between the potential equation and the other criteria of potential games .",
    "moreover , an interesting problem is how to get the verification equations with the minimum number . in this paper",
    ", we further investigate the solvability of the potential equation .",
    "an equivalence transformation is constructed to convert the augmented matrix of the potential equation into the reduced row echelon form .",
    "based on this technique , some new necessary and sufficient conditions for potential games are obtained . for potential games , a new formula to calculate the potential functions is proposed .",
    "based on the obtained results , it is revealed the connection between the potential equation and the results in hino ( 2011 ) and sandholm ( 2010 ) .    throughout the paper ,",
