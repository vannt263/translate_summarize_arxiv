    "the spectrum of cosmic matter fluctuations is an important constraint on theoretical models of structure formation ( e.g.  press & schechter 1974 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ; bower 1991 ; kauffmann & white 1993 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) . the amplitude of the power spectrum is parametrized as @xmath1 , the linear - theory value of the rms fractional fluctuations in density averaged in spheres of @xmath4 radius at @xmath5 .",
    "several methods have been used to estimate @xmath1 : measurement of the abundance of galaxy clusters ( eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; borgani et al.2001 ; reiprich & bhringer 2001 ; seljak 2001 ; allen et al .",

    "2002 ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) studies ( sievers et al.2002 ; bond et al .",
    "2002 ) , combined analysis of galaxy redshift survey and cmb data ( lahav et al .",
    "current estimates of @xmath1 range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , with claimed statistical uncertainties in the range @xmath80.15 .",
    "overall , the situation is characterized by a lack of agreement between the results from different methods , or the same methods used on different samples , suggesting that systematic uncertainties probably lie at the heart of the current disagreement over the value of @xmath1 .    in this letter",
    "we investigate systematic biases in the use of cluster abundances to measure @xmath1 . in principal the mass function of galaxy clusters , @xmath9 , should yield a direct constraint on @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is not currently possible to measure cluster masses with the precision and in the numbers required to construct a robust cluster mass function from direct measurement .",
    "the local cluster x - ray temperature function , @xmath10 , has proved more accessible ( e.g.  edge et al .",
    "1990 ; henry & arnaud 1991 ; markevitch 1998 ; blanchard et al .",
    "2000 ; pierpaoli et al .",
    "2000 ; ikebe et al.2002 ) .",
    "the x - ray temperature function in conjunction with a robust mass - temperature calibration therefore offers an opportunity to constrain @xmath1 .",
    "observational attempts to calibrate the mass - temperature relation typically rely on x - ray observations of clusters ( e.g.  markevitch 1998 ; nevalainen , markevitch & forman 2000 ; finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer 2001 ; allen , schmidt & fabian 2001 , hereafter asf ; reiprich & bhringer 2002 ) .",
    "despite the progress made by allen ( 1998 ) in understanding x - ray based cluster mass measurements , x - ray techniques continue to assume that all clusters are symmetric , equilibrium systems .",
    "this is a major concern , because @xmath1170% of galaxy clusters appear to be dynamically immature ( e.g.  mohr et al .",
    "1995 ; buote & tsai 1996 ; ota & mitsuda 2002 ; smith et al .",
    "2003 , in prep .",
    ", hereafter s03 ) , and this immaturity has a measurable systematic impact on the normalization of the cluster mass - temperature and mass - luminosity relations ( ota & mitsuda 2002 ; s03 ; see also randall et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , mass estimates based on gravitational lensing are insensitive to the physical nature and state of the cluster mass .",
    "cluster lensing studies are therefore free from the symmetry and equilibrium assumptions that plague the x - ray studies .",
    "attempts to use lensing to calibrate the cluster mass - temperature relation have so far relied on previously published and/or crude cluster mass estimates ( hjorth et al .  1998 ; asf ; viana , nichol & liddle 2002 ) .",
    "a major improvement on these pioneering studies would come from a precise and uniform analysis of a large objectively selected cluster sample for which high resolution space - based optical and x - ray data were available . in anticipation of such a program we conduct a pilot study using s03 s _ hubble space telescope ( hst)/chandra _ gravitational lensing survey of ten x - ray luminous galaxy clusters at @xmath0 .",
    "s03 made precise cluster mass and temperature measurements and thus constrained the high - mass end of the cluster mass - temperature relation .",
    "they also studied the dependence of this normalization on cluster substructure , concluding that unrelaxed clusters are , on average , @xmath12 hotter than relaxed clusters .",
    "s03 s results therefore offer a unique opportunity to study the impact of cluster substructure on estimates of @xmath1 .",
    "we summarize s03 s results in  2 , describe our modeling and results in  3 and summarize our conclusions in  4 .",
    "we express the hubble parameter in terms of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "we also adopt @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "s03 studied a representative sample of ten of the most x - ray luminous clusters ( @xmath17 , 0.12.4kev ) in a narrow redshift slice at @xmath18 , with line - of - sight reddening of @xmath19 from the xbacs sample ( ebeling et al .",
    "each cluster was typically observed for 3 orbits ( i.e.  7.5ks ) through the f702w filter using the wfpc2 camera onboard _",
    "s03 used these data in conjunction with ground - based optical and near - infrared data ( smith et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) , and the lenstool software ( kneib 1993 ; kneib et al .  1996",
    "; smith 2002 ) to construct a detailed gravitational lens model of each cluster .",
    "armed with these models , s03 measured @xmath20 , the total projected cluster mass within @xmath21 , i.e.  the radius at which the density of matter in the clusters falls to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the critical density required to close the universe .",
    ", @xmath21 corresponds to the edge of the _ hst_/wfpc2 field of view for the most massive clusters in s03 s sample . ]",
    "s03 also used the models to divide their sample into relaxed ( @xmath24 ) and unrelaxed ( @xmath25 ) clusters where @xmath26 is the total projected mass of the cluster within @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the projected mass of the cluster within the same radius that is not associated with the main centrally - located dark matter halo and cluster central galaxy .",
    "a complementary analysis of archival and _ asca _ observations of eight and one of these clusters respectively also provided accurate measurements of the temperature of each cluster ( @xmath29 ) within a projected radius of @xmath30 .",
    "we refer the reader to s03 for further details of the modeling and analysis of these clusters .",
    "we plot s03 s mass and temperature measurements in fig .  1 .",
    "the open symbols show the individual clusters , and the filled symbols indicate the properties of the mean relaxed and unrelaxed cluster sub - samples .",
    "the mean temperatures of the relaxed and unrelaxed clusters , are @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , where the error bars are the uncertainties on the means and are the estimated from bootstrap re - sampling each sub - sample of clusters ; we therefore expect these error bars to be over - estimates .",
    "the unrelaxed clusters appear to be systematically hotter than the relaxed clusters .",
    "two of s03 s sample ( a383  smith et al .",
    "2001 ; a1835  e.g.schmidt et al .",
    "2001 ) have central cooling timescales of @xmath33 .",
    "this is in line with expectations from other representative samples of x - ray luminous clusters ( peres et al.1998 ) .",
    "s03 therefore recalculated all of the cluster temperatures using an @xmath34 annulus ( i.e. excluding the cold core of the two extreme `` cooling flow '' systems ) .",
    "they found that , while the temperature difference is slightly reduced ( @xmath35 ) , it is robust to the exclusion of the central @xmath36 of each cluster from the temperature calculations .",
    "the @xmath12 temperature difference therefore does reflect a bona fide difference between the ambient temperatures of relaxed and unrelaxed clusters .",
    "we note that this affect is similar to a substructure - related bias found by ota & mitsuda ( 2002 ) in the cluster mass - luminosity relation .",
    " @xmath20 , the projected mass within @xmath21 , versus the temperature of the intra - cluster medium for s03 s sample of x - ray luminous clusters .",
    "the unrelaxed clusters are on average @xmath12 hotter than the relaxed clusters , causing a previously unquantified structural bias in the normalization of the cluster mass - temperature relation .",
    "we also plot s03 s and asf s mass - temperature relations , assuming a canonical logarithmic slope of @xmath37 for the s03 relation .",
    "the asf relation agrees with the two cooling flow clusters in s03 s sample ( a383 and a1835 are the two open circles that lie within 1@xmath38 of the line ) .",
    "we construct a simple model to investigate the impact of s03 s results on estimates of @xmath1 .",
    "we begin by parameterizing the cluster mass - temperature relation : @xmath39 where @xmath29 and @xmath20 are as defined in  2 , and @xmath40 are the normalization and logarithmic slope respectively .",
    "we first convert the jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) mass function to a temperature function .",
    "this conversion includes the following elements : a mass - dependent concentration index ( eke , navarro & steinmetz 2001 ) , conversion of three - dimensional masses from the simulations to projected two - dimensional masses ( hjorth et al .",
    "1998 ) and an observational mass - temperature normalization ( s03 , asf ) .",
    "we then fit this model temperature function to the observed temperature function ( edge et al .",
    "1990 ) using a single free parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "our model also contains the following parameters : \\{@xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 } where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the matter and vacuum energy densities of the universe at @xmath5 , @xmath43 is the spectral shape parameter for the power spectrum and @xmath44 is the scatter in @xmath45 ) .",
    "we focus our attention on the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath46 and to a lesser extent on @xmath44 ; we therefore adopt `` concordance '' values for the remaining parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath47 ( e.g.  efstathiou et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath37 ( e.g.  asf ) .",
    "we stress that we adopt a fixed value of @xmath15 , and therefore do not investigate the @xmath1@xmath41 degeneracy .",
    "we use two independent mass - temperature calibrations to normalize our models .",
    "we begin with s03 s normalization , and adopt the values of @xmath46 and @xmath44 relevant to their entire sample : @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( see solid line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "we compute a model temperature function and fit it to the observed temperature function ( edge et al .",
    "1990 ) , obtaining a best - fit of @xmath50 where the uncertainty is the statistical uncertainty on the fit .",
    "we plot this best - fit model and the observed temperature function in fig .",
    ", we turn to asf s cooling flow mass - temperature relation .",
    "these authors observed a sample of seven cooling flow clusters with _",
    "chandra _ , and used these data to normalize the mass - temperature relation .",
    "we convert asf s cooling flow mass - temperature relation into the form required for our model : @xmath51 , @xmath52 . using these values ,",
    "we construct a model temperature function and fit it to the observed function , obtaining @xmath53 .",
    "this model ( fig .",
    "2 ) fits the data less well than the s03-based model , with the largest residuals occurring at high temperatures .",
    " we plot the edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) cluster temperature function for both all clusters and cooling flow clusters ( defined as containing a line - emitting central galaxy ) , together with the best - fit model temperature functions that are normalized with the s03 and asf mass - temperature relations . when a cooling flow cluster based normalization is applied to a representative sample of clusters",
    ", @xmath1 is over - estimated by @xmath54 . however , when the cluster selection function is accounted for properly in both the model normalization and the observed temperature function , consistent values of @xmath1 are obtained .",
    "a simple interpretation of these two models is that it is important to understand the cluster selection function when using cluster abundances to measure @xmath1 . specifically , using a cooling - flow cluster mass - temperature normalization",
    "when studying the temperature function of a representative sample of clusters may cause @xmath1 to be over - estimated by approximately @xmath55 .",
    "we test this interpretation by fitting the cooling flow normalized model to a temperature function that describes just cooling flow clusters .",
    "we first use the observed correlation between line emission from cluster central galaxies and short cooling timescales ( @xmath56 years  edge et al .",
    "1992 ; peres et al .",
    "1998 ; crawford et al .  1999 ) to construct a `` cooling flow only '' temperature function from the edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) sample .",
    "we then fit the cooling flow model to the cooling flow data and obtain a best - fit value of @xmath57 , which agrees with the value obtained from the original model that was normalized with s03 s results .",
    "we plot this best - fit model and the relevant data in fig .",
    "2 . this model confirms our interpretation that cluster substructure is an important and previously unidentified systematic effect at the @xmath55 level when using cluster abundances to constrain @xmath1 .",
    "the low value of @xmath1 obtained in  3.2 is similar to a number of other recent results that favor @xmath20.8 ( e.g.  seljak 2001 ; reiprich & bhringer 2001 ; borgani et al .  2001 ;",
    "allen et al .  2002 ;",
    "viana , nichol & liddle 2002 ; lahav et al .",
    "2002 ; brown et al .  2002 ; jarvis et al .",
    "however , several other uncertainties need to be investigated before a reliable conclusion on the value of @xmath1 from cluster abundance determinations can be drawn .",
    "firstly , we highlight the extrapolation of s03 s lens models from @xmath21 ( i.e.  approximately the edge of the _ hst_/wfpc2 field of view at @xmath58 ) to the cluster virial radii as a key systematic uncertainty in our analysis .",
    "bardeau et al .",
    "( in prep . ) investigate this effect in detail through their weak - shear analysis of panoramic ( @xmath59 ) cfh12k @xmath60band imaging of the s03 cluster sample .",
    "prior to the completion of this wide - field analysis , we note that weak lensing analyses of individual clusters ( e.g.  king , clowe & schneider 2002 ) are unable to discriminate between isothermal ( @xmath61 ) and navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) ( @xmath62 ) profiles on large scales .",
    "we therefore exploit this lack of discriminatory power to make a conservative estimate of this systematic uncertainty .",
    "we integrate both profiles over the radial range @xmath63 ( i.e.  the dynamic range over which we are extrapolating ) , and estimate that the uncertainty in profile shape introduces an uncertainty in the virial mass estimate for an individual cluster of @xmath64 , which translates into an uncertainty in cluster temperature ( assuming @xmath65 ) of @xmath54 .",
    "this equates to a @xmath66 `` extrapolation '' systematic uncertainty in @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , we identify the projection of three - dimensional cluster masses from numerical simulations to observed two - dimensional masses (  3.1 ) as a further source of systematic uncertainty . as hjorth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss , the magnitude of this uncertainty depends on the slope of the cluster density profile at small radii .",
    "recent observational results ( smith et al .  2001 ; sand , treu & ellis 2002 ; dahle , hannestad & sommer - larsen 2002 ) indicate that there may be substantial intrinsic scatter in this slope , appearing to contradict theoretical claims for a universal profile ( e.g.  navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) . given these complications ,",
    "we conservatively adopt a further @xmath67 `` projection '' systematic uncertainty in @xmath1 .    in summary , although s03 s detailed lens models allow the `` substructure '' systematic to be accounted for properly and ( to first order ) eliminated from our analysis , `` extrapolation '' and `` projection '' uncertainties combine to produce a @xmath54 systematic that we are unable to control with the current dataset .",
    "we have used s03 s substructure - dependent cluster mass - temperature normalization to investigate the impact of cluster substructure on estimates of @xmath1 .",
    "we find that when a cooling flow cluster mass - temperature normalization is applied to the general cluster population , @xmath1 is over - estimated by @xmath55 .",
    "a clear understanding of the cluster selection function is therefore fundamental to attempts to constrain @xmath1 with cluster abundances .",
    "the simple x - ray luminosity - limited selection of s03 s sample (  2 ) enable us to account for this `` substructure '' systematic from our analysis and thus to estimate that @xmath68 .",
    "however , before we conclude that @xmath69 , we highlight two further systematic effects which may bias our analysis : extrapolation of s03 s small field - of - view lens models out to the cluster virial radii , and uncertainties in the relationship between three - dimensional mass information contained in numerical simulations and the two - dimensional mass information that is available from observations .",
    "we estimate conservatively that these effects combine to produce a further @xmath55 systematic uncertainty , and therefore we conclude from the present data that @xmath3 .",
    "we also note that the recently reported discrepancies between _ xmm_- and _ chandra_-based cluster temperature measurements ( schmidt et al.2001 ; majerowicz et al .",
    "2002 ; markevitch 2002 ) may introduce further uncertainty into cluster abundance determinations of @xmath1 .",
    "our 20% `` substructure '' systematic is similar to the discrepancy between the canonical value of @xmath701 ( e.g.  eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; pierpaoli et al .",
    "2001 ; bacon et al .  2002",
    "; bond et al.2002 ; hoekstra et al .  2002",
    "; refregier et al .  2002 ; van waerbeke et al .  2002 ) and recent claims for @xmath20.8 ( seljak 2001 ; reiprich & bhringer 2001 ; borgani et al .  2001 ; allen et al.2002 ; brown et al .  2002 ; jarvis et al .  2002 ; lahav et al .  2002 ; schuecker et al .",
    "2002 ; viana , nichol & liddle 2002 ) .",
    "our results therefore offer a physically motivated explanation for some of this discrepancy .",
    "independent confirmation of this comes from randall et al.s ( 2002 ) semi - analytic study of the effect of cluster mergers on the observed luminosity and temperature functions , and thus on the inferred cluster mass function .",
    "randall et al .  predict that cluster mergers boost the observed temperature function and can cause @xmath1 to be over - estimated by @xmath55 if hydrostatic equilibrium is assumed for non - equilibrium clusters , in agreement with our observational results .",
    "all three systematics discussed in this letter ( substructure , extrapolation and projection ) affect the ability of cluster abundance techniques to measure @xmath1 accurately , regardless of whether gravitational lensing or x - ray techniques are used to measure the cluster masses .",
    "however , the insensitivity of gravitational lensing to the physical nature and state of the cluster matter means that a combined strong- and weak - lensing study of a large , objectively selected sample of clusters should be the tool of choice for future cluster abundance studies .",

    "<S> this helps to explain the wide range in @xmath1 derived from different techniques , @xmath21 , and offers a physically motivated explanation for some of the discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify two further systematics in our analysis : ( i ) extrapolation of small field - of - view mass measurements to the cluster virial radius and ( ii ) projection of 3dimensional masses contained in numerical simulations to the 2dimensional information that is available from observations . </S>",
    "<S> we combine quantitative estimates of these two effects with our model fitting to estimate from the current data that @xmath3 , where the systematic error reflects the extrapolation and projection uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> all three systematics ( substructure , extrapolation and projection ) are fundamental to future cluster - based measurements of @xmath1 regardless of the techniques employed . however , we identify gravitational lensing as the tool of choice for such studies , because a combination of strong- and weak - lensing offers the most direct route to control the systematics and thus achieve an unbiased comparison between observation and theory .    </S>",
