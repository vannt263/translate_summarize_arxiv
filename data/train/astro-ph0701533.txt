    "synthetic evolutionary models play an important role in the study of tp - agb stars .",
    "the synthetic approach allows the computation of evolutionary grids covering wide age and metallicity intervals , and the easy testing of different input prescriptions ( like the mass loss rates and dredge - up efficiency ) so as to reproduce basic observational constraints .",
    "due to these characteristics , they are suitable for population synthesis of galaxies , i.e. to the modelling of their resolved stars , and of their integrated light .    since the work by groenewegen & de jong ( 1993 ) , the carbon star luminosity functions ( cslfs ) in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) have been used to calibrate the onset and efficiency of third dredge - up events in synthetic tp - agb models . nowadays",
    ", many more observables potentially useful to the calibration process of synthetic models can be individuated .",
    "suffice it to recall that for a few regions of the mcs , we dispose of optical plus near - ir photometry of all stars above the rgb - tip ( ogle , denis , 2mass ) , spectroscopic c / m classification , variability data ( eros , ogle , macho ) , mid - ir photometry and spectra ( iso , spitzer ) , a good hint of their star formation history from deep hst data , plus the [ fe / h ] distribution of red giants from ground - based spectroscopy . the simulation of such observables starting from grids of agb tracks  and taking into account biases , errors , incompleteness , etc .",
    " should allow us to make many specific tests on their processes of nuclear burning , mixing , mass - loss and pulsation , and test correlations between quantities ( e.g. @xmath0 , @xmath1 , surface c / o ratio , mass loss rates , periods , etc . ) that are expected to be closely interrelated .",
    "therefore , we aim at a more complete testing and exploitation of tp - agb evolutionary tracks , by means of comparisons of mock catalogues with real data for local group galaxies . to this aim , the trilegal code has been adapted to deal with sophisticated tp - agb tracks ( sect .  [ sec_tracks ] ) and to simulate more observables in addition to the photometry  including the spectral classification , mass loss rates , and pulsational properties of agb stars ( sect .",
    "[ sec_adapt ] ) .",
    "a few preliminary applications are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec_results ]",
    "the trilegal code ( groenewegen et al .  2002 ; girardi et al .  2005 ;",
    "vanhollebeke et al . , this meeting ) is a complex tool to produce mock catalogues for both the milky way and external galaxies .",
    "it stands on a series of routines that efficiently construct sample of stars by interpolating within grids of evolutionary models , and then it attributes a photometry to each star by consulting into tables of bolometric corrections .",
    "presently , there is a quite good calibration for the milky way geometry in trilegal , and external galaxies like the mcs can be easily simulated for a fixed distance and foreground reddening .",
    "an interactive web interface to trilegal is available at http://trilegal.ster.kuleuven.be .",
    "trilegal uses the low- and intermediate - mass stellar tracks by girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) up to the end of the early - agb .",
    "these are complemented with synthetic tp - agb tracks from various sources : ( i ) the same ones as described in girardi & bertelli ( 1998 ) , relying on an extremely simplified formalism , without any dredge up and hot - bottom burning ; this naive approach was justified as initial applications of trilegal were not dealing with agb stars .",
    "( ii ) marigo et al .  ( 1999 ) tracks calibrated on the cslfs in the mcs , computed with  as so far standard in the field of stellar evolution  the erroneous approximation of solar - scaled opacities ; the corresponding isochrones were published by marigo & girardi ( 2001 ) .",
    "( iii ) tracks computed for studying the sfh in the magellanic clouds ( cioni et al .",
    "2006ab ) , now adopting consistent low - temperature opacities for c - rich mixtures ( the so - called @xmath2-var case in marigo 2002 ) .",
    "( iv ) finally , a newly computed set of @xmath2-var tracks ( marigo & girardi , in prep . ) calibrated not only on the cslfs but also on the lifetimes derived from the c- and m - star counts in mc star clusters ( girardi & marigo 2006 ) .",
    "some of these isochrone sets are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_isoc ] ( and are available in http://pleiadi.oapd.inaf.it ) . the procedure for changing",
    "the set of tp - agb tracks is straightforward so that any future set of tracks can be immediately included and tested .",
    "notice that the isochrones of fig .",
    "[ fig_isoc ] have been constructed using the quiescent stages of h - burning along the tp - agb .",
    "this simplification is necessary to speed up the interpolations inside grids of tp - agb tracks .",
    "individual tracks instead have been computed with a detailed description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 variations during thermal pulse cycles .",
    "a few features have been added to trilegal , in order to face the challenges posed by agb populations :    first of all , in producing mock catalogues we re - introduce the @xmath0 and @xmath1 variations driven by thermal pulses in agb stars .",
    "this is performed by generating a random phase of the pulse cycle for each simulated star , then computing the @xmath3 variation with wagenhuber & groenewegen s ( 1998 ) formulas , and then converting it into a @xmath4 by using the slopes in the hr diagram previously derived from envelope integrations .",
    "this is performed separately for c- and m - type stars , which present very different @xmath5 slopes .",
    "second , we properly derive quantities such as the mass loss rates , pulsation modes and periods for the interpolated stars .",
    "our experience is that this can not be simply performed by interpolating between the tracks , due to the recurrent switch of pulsation mode along the pulse cycles .",
    "these quantities , instead , have to be re - derived from other ones such as the stellar mass , radius , c / o ratio , etc .",
    ", which are now included into the tracks and isochrone tables .",
    "third , we need to properly deal with bolometric corrections for c - stars , and for all agb stars with dusty envelopes .",
    "this step is presently under development . at the stage of this writing",
    ", we are using empirical bolometric corrections and @xmath1-colour relations for c - stars ( cf .",
    "marigo et al .",
    "marigo et al .  ( 2003 ) already used some of these adaptations of trilegal to demonstrate that tp - agb models with variable molecular opacities do naturally produce the `` red tail '' of c - stars observed in @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 diagrams of the mcs .",
    "moreover , cioni et al .",
    "( 2006ab , and this meeting ) , used it to map variations of mean metallicity and age across the mcs .",
    "figure  [ fig_mloss ] and [ fig_periods ] present additional simulations for the stellar populations in the mcs and in the milky way disk , that mostly regard the mass loss rates and pulsation periods .",
    "figure  [ fig_mloss ] shows the predicted distribution of mass - loss rates for galactic m- and c - type miras , as compared to observations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dispersion of @xmath8 at given period in this diagram is a consequence of using bowen & willson s ( 1991 ) and wachter et al.s ( 2002 ) prescriptions for the mass loss ( for m- and c - type stars , respectively ) , and it would be absent if we were using simple fits to the empirical data , like the relation provided by vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) . on the other hand , tracks computed with reimers ( 1975 ) mass loss formula would fail to reproduce the observed values at the high end . with this kind of simulations , one can really test whether present - day prescriptions for mass loss ( either theoretical or empirical ) are consistent with the observed distributions , taking into account also the completeness of observed samples .",
    "figure  [ fig_periods ] compares observed and simulated p ",
    "l sequences of lpvs .",
    "so far , we have included just the first overtone and fundamental modes of lpvs , that correspond to the b and c sequences observed in microlensing surveys of the magellanic clouds .",
    "we plot only the stars falling inside the lpv instability strips ( gautschy 1999 ) . comparing with the data compiled by groenewegen ( 2004 ) , we are able to reproduce some of the observed features , such as the slopes of the sequences , the trend of c stars being more luminous than m ones in sequences b and c , and the higher fraction of c stars in sequence c ( fundamental mode ) than in b ( first overtone ) . however , first overtone periods are smaller than observed in sequence b , and the detailed number counts in both sequences suggest us that a small upward shift is needed to the `` critical luminosities '' that define the transition from first overtone to fundamental mode .",
    "adjustments made to fix these problems would have a moderate impact on the mass loss rates used in the models , that on the other hand would affect properties like lifetimes and star counts .",
    "it becomes then clear that more detailed comparisons of this kind are worth being pursued .    in summary",
    ", we are ready to make statistically significant comparisons between predictions of tp - agb models , and observations of agb star samples in local group galaxies . these comparisons are no longer limited to just the photometry , but now include other crucial properties such as the mass loss rates , surface chemical composition , and pulsation periods .",
