    "the scheme of the unified compositeness of leptons , quarks and higgs bosons , with constituents in common , provides one of the promising ways to go beyond the standard model ( sm ) ( for a short review , see  @xcite ) . treating the sm higgs doublet as goldstone boson in the scheme",
    ", one can solve , in particular , the naturalness problem of the higgs sector in the sm without supersymmetry .",
    "a nonlinear model was investigated in the lines described above by one of the present authors ( yu.f.p . ) in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the sm is to be considered just a renormalizable part of the `` low energy '' effective field theory caused by the unified compositeness .",
    "the effective `` low energy '' theory of the unified compositeness is based on some rather general assumptions about symmetry properties .",
    "let the hypothetical hyperstrong interactions responsible for the internal binding of the sm composite particles posses a global chiral symmetry @xmath11 .",
    "under the hyperstrong confinement , the symmetry @xmath11 breakes down to some of its subgroup @xmath12 at the scale @xmath13 . in this , the true goldstone bosons appear which are ultimately identified , in particular , as the higgs doublet .",
    "the unbroken symmetry @xmath14 must contain the sm symmetry @xmath15 .",
    "thus at the first stage , the electroweak symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "ultimate taking into account the gauge quantum corrections , corresponding to some extended electroweak symmetry @xmath16 , results in the sm electroweak symmetry breaking at the fermi scale @xmath17 .",
    "if this breaking happens only under two - loop corrections , the naturalness relation between the scales @xmath18 and @xmath13 takes place : @xmath19 .",
    "so @xmath13 is expected to lie naturally in the deca - tev region : @xmath20tev ) .",
    "the minimal extension of the sm symmetry to implement such a scenario is given by the choice @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the intrinsic local subgroup being @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding nonlinear model @xmath24 may be called the minimal nonlinear standard model ( mnsm ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we describe in short the linearization of the model via the phenomenon of the hidden local symmetry",
    ". then we present the crucial phenomenological consequences of the unified compositeness at the future 4 tev @xmath25 collider ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "as the nonlinear model , the mnsm is built on the nonlinear realization of @xmath11 that becomes linear when restricted to @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "such a model is equivalent , at least at the classical level , to the model with linearly realized symmetry @xmath26  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath27 is the hidden local symmetry with the appropriate auxiliary gauge bosons . in the context of the mnsm",
    "the phenomenon of the hidden local symmetry was studied in ref .",
    "the essence of the latter one is as follows .    in the linear model ,",
    "the field variable is the element of the whole group @xmath11 which can be parametrized as : @xmath28 and @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the higgs - goldstone doublet , @xmath31 is the goldstone boson corresponding to the broken hypercharge @xmath32 , with @xmath13 and @xmath33 being the symmetry breaking mass scales .",
    "the following transformation law under @xmath34 takes place : @xmath35 the linear model describes spontaneous / dynamical symmetry breaking @xmath36 , with the total local symmetry being broken as @xmath37 .    to construct the lagrangian of the linear model one has to introduce the modified differential 1-form @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the derivative covariant both under the intrinsic gauge symmetry @xmath40 and the hidden local symmetry @xmath27 .",
    "let us divide @xmath41 into two parts : @xmath42 which is parallel to @xmath24 and @xmath43 orthogonal to it . under @xmath26",
    "the parallel part @xmath42 transforms homogeneously as in the original nonlinear model , and so does now the orthogonal part @xmath43 .",
    "it is precisely introducing the auxiliary vector fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 , corresponding to @xmath27 , that makes the transformation of @xmath46 homogeneous . in the unitary under @xmath27 gauge ,",
    "i.e. , at @xmath47 in eq .  1 , the modified 1-form looks like @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the 1-form present in the original mnsm , @xmath50 and @xmath51 being some new strong coupling constants ( expectedly , @xmath52 and similarly for @xmath51 ) .    in the lagrangian of the linear model , the new terms appear .",
    "they are related with the orthogonal part of the modified 1-form . here",
    "are some of the appropriate terms in the gauge sector : @xmath53 and for fermions they are @xmath54 here @xmath55 s and @xmath56 s are free parameters .",
    "it s to be noted that the matter fields @xmath57 transform now only under @xmath27 .",
    "the modified covariant derivative for them contains only the composite @xmath58 and @xmath45 , but not the elementary @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the latter ones entering only through the nonminimal interactions .",
    "introducing the vector fields in such a way without kinetic terms is just a formal procedure .",
    "but we believe that the required kinetic terms are developed by the quantum effects , and the new composite vector bosons become physical .",
    "this takes place , e.g. , in 2- and 3-dimensional nonlinear @xmath61-models  @xcite , as well as in the hadron physics as accomplished fact .",
    "from the lagrangian of the linear model , one can read off the lagrangian terms of the vector boson - current interactions : @xmath62 here @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the usual sm isotriplet currents , with @xmath65 being the sm covariant derivative . to these isospin terms",
    ", one has to add the similar hypercharge isosinglet terms .",
    "impose now the natural requirement that all the composite particles @xmath30 and @xmath57 interact directly only with the composite vector bosons @xmath66 and @xmath67 , but not with the elementary ones @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in other words , this is the well - known hypothesis of the vector boson dominance ( vbd ) .",
    "this requirement allows one to fix the free parameters : @xmath70 , @xmath71 and similarly for the isosinglet parameters .",
    "the terms @xmath72 and @xmath73 describe the mass mixing of the elementary and composite gauge bosons , namely , @xmath68 with @xmath66 and @xmath69 with @xmath67 . diagonalizing these terms",
    "one gets two sets of physical vector bosons : the massless isotriplet and isosinglet physical bosons @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as well as the massive ones @xmath76 and @xmath77 with masses of order @xmath13 . due to the heavy physical vector boson exchange , the new low energy effective",
    "current - current interactions appear in addition to that of the sm : @xmath78 here @xmath79 is a free parameter , related to the original mnsm . note that the vbd does not affect the low energy higgs boson self - interactions , the latter ones being determined by the original mnsm alone : @xmath80 ( up to the fiertz rearrangement ) .",
    "all these expressions are valid only at energies @xmath81 .    to resume , the unified compositeness plus the vbd prescribe the two - parameter set of the universal residual fermion - fermion , fermion - boson and boson - boson interactions , with their space - time and internal structure being fixed , sign including .",
    "the unified compositeness scale @xmath13 is expected to lie in the deca - tev region .",
    "hence the tev energies are required to probe these new contact interactions .",
    "in a series of papers we have investigated the possibility to test the hypothesis of the vbd of electroweak interaction at the future 2  tev @xmath83 linear collider via the processes @xmath84 , where @xmath85  @xcite , @xmath86 , @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath87  @xcite . in this report",
    "we have reconsidered the results for the future @xmath1 collider with the total energy 4  tev and the integrated luminocity 10@xmath88  @xcite , and found that this collider could present the definite answer about the existence ( or opposite ) of the deca - tev unified compositeness .    to illustrate the dependence of the observables on the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath13 , we present in what follow the simple approximate formulas for differential cross - sections for some of the processes .",
    "@xmath89 : @xmath90 here and in what follows @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the effective weak mixing angle and @xmath94 is the effective fine structure constant at energies under consideration .",
    "scattering angle @xmath95 is that between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 : @xmath99 here @xmath95 is the scattering angle between @xmath100 and @xmath97 and @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 are the usual invariant kinematical variables .",
    "@xmath4 : @xmath104 @xmath95 is the scattering angle between @xmath105 and @xmath97 and @xmath106 is the c.m.@xmath105 boson energy .",
    "the structure of these expressions is rather simple , namely , the appropriate sm contributions to the cross - sections are rescaled by factors @xmath107 all these expressions are valid in the kinematical region @xmath108 and are obtained in the high energy limit by neglecting the terms @xmath109 relative to these @xmath110 coupling ( @xmath111 ) in the total cross - sections of the processes @xmath4 and @xmath87 proved to be numerically negligible at the energy under consideration . ] .",
    "all the leading terms in this limit come from the lagrangian of eq .",
    "8 , i.e. , from the vbd interactions .",
    "note that the cross - sections for all the processes @xmath112 ( except for @xmath113 ) have the same structure as that for @xmath114 ( eq .",
    "10 ) with the same rescaling factors .",
    "similarly for the process @xmath115 relative to that @xmath4 , but here @xmath116 in eq .",
    "12 should be replaced by a more complicated function of kinematical variables .",
    "the differential cross - section is the most sensitive observable for detecting any kind of contact interactions via the deviation from the sm .",
    "but the parameter dependence of the angular distributions is quite involved . to unravel it without calculating a lot of angular distributions we chose as more illuminative a set of integral characteristics .",
    "they are : the relative deviation in the total cross - sections from the sm values @xmath117 with @xmath118 being the polarized cross - section @xmath119 , the forward - backward charge asymmetry @xmath120 the left - right polarization asymmetry @xmath121 and the polarized charge asymmetry @xmath122    we have calculated these observables ( if not trivial ) for the processes @xmath114 , @xmath1 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath98 , @xmath127 , @xmath87 as functions of the parameter @xmath79 for the various values of @xmath13 . under `` jets '' we mean only these of the light and charmed hadrons . fig .",
    "1 is a typical example of such a calculation for the process @xmath128 .",
    "note that all the numerical results have been obtained using the exact born expressions for differential cross - sections .",
    "nevertheless eqs .",
    "1012 give good approximations for both the qualitative and quantitative conclusions .",
    "for all the processes ( exept for @xmath129 and the @xmath68 pair production ) all the asymmetries have the similar behaviour .",
    "first of all , there exists a particular value of @xmath130 when all the rescaling factors coincide with each other @xmath131 and thus all the asymmetries coincide with those of the sm .",
    "the only way to unravel the contact interactions in this particular case is to study directly the total cross - sections .",
    "but there should be strong natural reasons for this exceptional case to be realized .",
    "another particular value of @xmath132 provides the best case for studying the contact interactions , when all the asymmetries in all the processes saturate their maximal values .",
    "it is of no importance whether muon beam is polarized or not in the case of fermion pair production .",
    "but it is not so for the processes @xmath98 , @xmath127 and @xmath87 . in all the cases of bosons",
    "production one has @xmath133 .",
    "hence one is lead to conclude that it is preferable to work with the maximally right - handedly polarized muons to observe as large deviations in the total cross - sections from the sm as possible .",
    "2 presents the deviations in the total cross - sections for the unpolarized muons , as well as for the right - handed muons with @xmath134 . here",
    "the higgs boson mass is taken to be @xmath135gev .",
    "the results are quite insensitive to it for the light and intermidiate higgs boson .",
    "one can see that the deviations for the right - handed polarizations are at least three times as large as these for the unpolarized muon beam .    to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed deviations consider , e.g. , the total cross - sections",
    ". taking into account only statistical errors , let us introduce the quantity @xmath136 that shows the number of the standard deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "we take the integrated luminocity @xmath137 expectedly to be 10@xmath88  @xcite .",
    "fig .  3 and fig .  4 present the reach for the scale @xmath13 at @xmath138 statistical level ( 95% c.l .",
    ") via the total cross - sections in the various channels .",
    "note that the calculation for the @xmath5 pair production has been made supposing the instrumental cut - off @xmath139 . in the cases of both the @xmath98 and @xmath129 optimal values of cut - offs , equal to @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively , have been chosen at the given instrumental ones . here",
    "the reach is maximal due to the maximal supression of the @xmath102 channel peak , at the statistics being still high enough .",
    "we see that the vbd can be tested for the unified substructure scale @xmath13 up to @xmath3tev ) in the processes @xmath2 , up to @xmath142tev ) in the @xmath1 annihilation into boson pairs and up to @xmath143tev ) in the process @xmath7 ( with the right - handedly polarized muon beam ) . for comparison",
    "we present also the reach for the scale @xmath13 at the @xmath144 statistical level ( 99% c.l . ) .",
    "we see that it is not much lower , except for the channel @xmath4 with the unpolarized muon beam   effect could overwhelm an induced reduction in luminocity . ] .",
    "one can estimate the energy and luminocity dependence of the attainable scale @xmath13 by equating the statistical uncertainty in the event number @xmath145 and the expected number of additional events due to the contact interactions @xmath146 .",
    "this gives @xmath147{s\\int{\\cal l}\\,dt}$ ] .",
    "thus the decrease of energy down to 2  tev at the fixed luminocity would result in @xmath148 decrease in the attainable scale @xmath13 .",
    "hence 2  tev collider is able to unravel the deca - tev substructure , too .",

    "in particular , the exotic triple gauge interactions ( tgi )  @xcite are conceivable too and can contribute to the @xmath5 pair production .",
    "the question arises as to what extent the two types of new interactions could imitate each other .",
    "the anomalous tgi should originate from a kind of the sm extension . here , the sm symmetry @xmath15 could be realized either linearly or nonlinearly . in the case of the nonlinear realization ( being still linear on the unbroken @xmath149 subgroup )",
    ", the nonlinearity scale @xmath150 is just the sm v.e.v",
    ".  @xmath18 .",
    "thus this kind of extension , in general , has nothing to do with the unified compositeness we consider . on the other hand , for the linear sm symmetry realization",
    "the scale @xmath150 is not directly related with @xmath18 and could be as high as desired .",
    "thus we chose it to be the unified compositeness scale @xmath20tev ) .",
    "all the conceivable linearly realized residual interactions are described by the @xmath15 invariant operators built of the sm fields  @xcite .",
    "all the operators which are relevant to the anomalous tgi vertices are naturally expected to be @xmath151 or less in the gauge couplings , but one exception @xmath152 .",
    "the latter stems from the nonlinear generalization of the field strengths in the nmsm .",
    "the similar gauge kinetic terms of the isotriplet @xmath68 and isosinglet @xmath69 bosons have no gauge couplings .",
    "so the same must naturally happen for @xmath152 , for its origin is of the same nature .",
    "thus we have retained the @xmath152 operator alone and have chosen the proper effective lagrangian to be @xmath153 where @xmath154 . with account for all the contributions from this operator we have found that the deviations from the sm predictions even in this most enhanced tgi case are much smaller then these in the vbd case .",
    "so the vbd is in fact dominant .",
    "the main results of our study are as follows :    * vbd of the sm gauge interactions is expected to be the universal dominant low energy feature of the unified compositeness of leptons , quarks and higgs bosons .",
    "* vbd of the sm electroweak interactions can be tested at the 4  tev @xmath1 collider for the unified compositeness scale @xmath13 up to @xmath3tev ) in @xmath155 , up to @xmath142tev ) in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and up to @xmath143tev ) in the process @xmath7 .",
    "* processes @xmath2 with various final fermions and @xmath156 , @xmath127 , @xmath87 are mutually complimentary .",
    "i.e. , at any values of compositeness scale @xmath13 and parameter @xmath79 ( but for @xmath157 ) one can choose the environments where the deviations from the sm are not zero .",
    "more than that , these deviations are tightly correlated . * for @xmath98 , @xmath127 and @xmath87",
