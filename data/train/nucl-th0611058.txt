    "the pion electromagnetic form factor , @xmath4 in vacuum shows that the physical @xmath0 meson is not a pure isospin eigenstate and it can mix with the @xmath1 meson @xcite . in vacuum",
    "this mixing amplitude can be determined by measuring @xmath5 which , although dominated by the @xmath6 pole , shows a kink near the @xmath1 meson mass . such mixing ( after electromagnetic correction ) implies that the charge symmetry is broken at the most fundamental level in strong interaction through the small mass difference between up and down quarks in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "consequently , the physical @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons that we deal with are admixtures of the corresponding isospin eigenstates . at the hadronic level this mixing can be understood in terms of neutron - proton mass difference in effective models @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-@xmath1 mixing has important and interesting consequences .",
    "it plays a crucial role in generating contributions to few body charge symmetry violating observables @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing amplitude is determined from @xmath7 by measuring the pion form factor in the interference region @xcite . with the extracted value of the mixing amplitude one",
    "is able to explain a number of observables namely , the non - coulombic binding energy difference ( nolen schiffer anomaly  @xcite ) of @xmath8 ( mirror ) nuclei , significant contributions to the @xmath9 asymmetry at 183 mev and non - negligible contributions to the difference of @xmath10 and @xmath11 scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "the mixing of different isospin states will be modified in matter .",
    "such medium effects have recently been investigated by several authors  @xcite . unlike neutron - proton mass difference , which is responsible for @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing in free space , the mixing in matter",
    "can be induced if the neutron - proton densities are different .",
    "this happens even if the hamiltonian preserves the isospin symmetry _",
    "i. e. _ , if @xmath12 , akin to the ` spontaneous symmetry breaking ' driven by the @xmath13 asymmetric ground state .",
    "it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the density dependent mixing is of similar magnitude as the usual vacuum mixing at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "subsequently , broniowski and florkowski , showed that the mixing could be significantly large in @xmath14 like nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these studies were limited to hadronic models .",
    "in contrast , such density dependent @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing was studied within the framework of qcd sum - rule in ref .",
    "@xcite with similar results and conclusions .",
    "the sum rule calculation has recently been improved and extended to study the density dependent @xmath0-@xmath1 amplitude and its observable implications in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we revisit the problem within the framework of walecka model @xcite .",
    "we discuss the possible consequences in presence of a scalar mean field , an effective way to incorporate nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "moreover , as in dense matter with large neutron - proton density asymmetry , the mixing angle could be quite high , we present results valid for arbitrary mixing angles .",
    "as an application , the possible modification of pion form factor in anm and the @xmath15 annihilation cross section at various densities and asymmetries have also been discussed .",
    "this is relevant for the dilepton production in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "therefore , the present investigation has direct relevance for the study of compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) expected to be produced in heavy ion collisions at gsi energies  @xcite .    apart from @xmath16 mixing in asymmetric matter @xmath0",
    "can also mix with the @xmath17 in the same way as @xmath18 mixing  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed such a possibility in appendix i where it is argued that for matter with small neutron - proton asymmetry such possibilities could be ignored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the formalism is set forth . in section 3",
    "the relations between dilepton production cross section and form factor with mixing has been presented .",
    "results are discussed in section 4 while section 5 is devoted to summary .",
    "mathematical expressions relevant for the calculation of pion form factor with matter induced mixing and @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson self energies in dense nuclear matter are relegated to the appendix .",
    "the lagrangian describing @xmath0 - @xmath1 meson - nucleon interaction is given by ,    & = & |(_a_a , ^_a)+|(_,^ ) , + _ v,&=&g_v . here",
    "@xmath19 where the subscript @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) stands for proton ( neutron ) .",
    "clearly , due to the pauli matrix @xmath22 , @xmath0 meson couples to neutron with a negative sign in contrast to the @xmath1 meson while with proton both couple with the same sign .",
    "this gives rise to mixing that vanishes in the limit , @xmath12 which is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "0.5 cm    here the mixing is generated by @xmath23 loop .",
    "the vacuum @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing in this approach was first calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we calculate similar mixing in anm which , besides @xmath21-@xmath20 mass difference , would also depend both on baryon density @xmath24 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath25 .    to determine the density and asymmetry dependent mixing amplitude we evaluate these loops at finite density which are characterized by the following density dependent polarization functions : @xmath26\\ ] ] where , @xmath27 @xmath28\\ ] ] @xmath29\\ ] ] here @xmath30 denotes free nucleon propagator while @xmath31 represents the density dependent part which forbids on mass shell nucleon propagation in matter due to pauli blocking @xcite . as the propagator",
    "now explicitly involves the fermi momentum , contributions will be different for the neutron and proton loops if their densities ( and hence fermi momenta ) are different .",
    "it is to be noted that the polarization function or the mixing amplitude will have two parts , one is like the polarization tensor with the free nucleon mass replaced by its effective mass called the free part representing nucleon - antinucleon excitations ( dirac sea ) and the other one is density dependent part relevant for the scattering from the fermi sphere .",
    "we discuss them separately .      the density dependent piece of the mixed polarization ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) due to @xmath20-@xmath20 or @xmath21-@xmath21 excitations is generically given by @xmath32\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 represents relevant traces as in ref.@xcite .",

    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 modes are constructed as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where the meson momentum @xmath51 ( see appendix for details ) .",

    "l , t^(k_f^n , m_n^*,q_0,|q| ) .",
    "the negative sign arises because of the @xmath22 in the @xmath0-@xmath53 interaction .",
    "the pure part of the polarization can be obtained by taking appropriate vertex factor like @xmath54 or @xmath55 for both the vertices .",
    "accordingly , the total is given by a _ sum _ over the neutron and proton loops instead of the _",
    "difference_. ^_l , t= _",
    "l , t^(k_f^p , m_p^*,q_0,|q|)+ _",
    "l , t^(k_f^n , m_n^*,q_0,|q| ) and similarly @xmath56 gives results for the @xmath1 meson polarization function .",
    "we take @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60  @xcite in numerical computations",
    ".      the vacuum part will also give rise to mixing which is same as ref.@xcite with @xmath21 and @xmath20 mass @xmath61 replaced by the in - medium masses , @xmath62 .",
    "in walecka model this is determined from the following self - consistent condition @xcite , m_n , p^*=m_n , p- ( _ p^s + _ n^s ) , [ mstar ] where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) represent scalar densities given by ^s_i= . [ emass ]    the free part of the polarization tensor can be written as , _",
    "f^ = ( -g^+q^ q^/q^2)_f(q^2 ) .",
    "the mixing contributions to @xmath65 are given by : _",
    "f , vv^ & = & q^2 _ 0 ^ 1dzz(1-z ) ,    _ f , vt^ & = & q^2 .    the pure @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) meson self - energies for the vector - vector , vector - tensor and tensor - tensor parts are given by  @xcite _ f^ ( ) & = & q^2_i = p , n , where i_1^(i)=_0 ^ 1dzz(1-z ) , i_2^(i)=_0 ^ 1dz .",
    "it is to be noted that the free part @xmath66 vanishes in the limit @xmath67 .",
    "we extract the real part of the vacuum mixing amplitude ( with free nucleon mass ) to be @xmath68mev@xmath69 at the omega pole and this is consistent with that of ref .",
    "when in - medium nucleon masses are included @xmath70 is equal to @xmath71 mev@xmath69 and @xmath72 mev@xmath69 at @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the @xmath0-dominated ( unmixed ) pion electromagnetic form factor is given by : f_(q^2)=1 - in the first form of vmd  @xcite .",
    "in presence of mixing , the above expression for pion form factor should be replaced by ( see appendix for detailed derivation ) @xmath76 here @xmath77 with @xmath78 . here the coupling of the physical @xmath0 and @xmath1 states to the photon is considered . in this form",
    "the @xmath79 decay is understood to proceed exactly like the @xmath0 but modified by the mixing factor @xmath80 and @xmath81 as appears in the denominator .    in the small mixing limit the term quadratic in @xmath82 in eq .",
    "[ fpi2 ] can be dropped and @xmath83 .",
    "thus , to lowest order in the mixing parameter @xmath84 , the above expression takes the form  @xcite    f_(q^2)=1 - g _ -g _ [ fpi1 ]    the coupling constants used are @xmath85 , @xmath86  @xcite and    & = & + & = & 3.5 0.18 .    in matter , the value of @xmath87 can acquire a density dependence due to the coupling with the @xmath88 excitation as discussed in  @xcite in the leading density approximation .",
    "it was shown that the coupling could increase by @xmath89 % near the @xmath0-pole at nuclear saturation density for finite width of the @xmath88 .",
    "in the zero width approximation it could be as large as double near the @xmath0-pole at saturation density .",
    "however , as far as our results are concerned there will be no appreciable change in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the problem of density dependence of the vertex function is an interesting problem by itself and a systematic approach would be to evaluate the full @xmath0-spectral function in the presence of mixing . for the present purpose",
    "we ignore such effects in order to bring out the effect of mixed polarization tensor into clearer focus .",
    "the cross section for dilepton production from pion annihilation is intimately connected to the density dependent pion form factor which is given by , ( q_0,|q|,_b,)= |f_(q_0,|q|)|^2 .",
    "it is to be noted that unlike in vacuum , the pion form factor in nuclear medium depends both on @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the dilepton emission rate in terms of the above cross section is given by = m^4 t k_1(m / t ) ( 1- ) where @xmath92 is the modified bessel function of second kind .",
    "it should be mentioned that in deriving the expression for in - medium @xmath5 ( eq.20 ) , the pions have been considered to be on shell . in relatrivistic heavy ion collisions the main contribution to dilepton production comes from pion annihilation where the pions are generally assumed to be on their mass shells . however , in a medium the pion dispersion relation is different from that of vacuum due its interaction .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the above calculation to incorporate this feature .",
    "this however , goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in fig .  [ fig2 ] , the in - medium pion form factor for @xmath93 mev together with its vacuum counterpart is shown . in matter the pole position shifts towards lower invariant mass indicating the decrease of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson masses in matter .",
    "it might be mentioned that in medium , the mass modification is caused by two different mechanisms , _ viz . _ the scattering from fermi sphere and excitation of the dirac vacuum . while the former gives rise to an increase of their masses , the latter dominates resulting in an overall reduction . near the pole , the mixing amplitude increases by large factors depending upon the value of the asymmetry parameter @xmath94 .",
    "clearly the density and asymmetry parameter dependent mixing is much larger than the mixing due to @xmath21-@xmath20 mass difference alone . in ref .  @xcite",
    "no significant effect of matter induced mixing on @xmath95 was observed .",
    "however , in the present model this is found to be substantial which can be attributed to the tensor interaction .",
    "moreover , we clearly show that the small angle approximation are not a good assumption in calculating pion form factor even for asymmetry relevant for heavy nuclei like @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows results for @xmath96 mev .",
    "though the qualitative features remain similar , one can see that the mixing amplitude depends strongly on the three momentum of the moving meson .",
    "in fact , the mixing is stronger for a slower vector meson .",
    "1.5 cm in fig .  4",
    ", we show the strong asymmetry dependence of the mixing which shifts the pole of the pion form factor towards lower invariant mass region .",
    "moreover , we also find that the results are quite sensitive to the asymmetry parameter ( @xmath94 ) .    as an application of the density and asymmetry parameter dependent pion form factor",
    ", we calculate the pion annihilation cross section in nuclear matter .",
    "the dilepton production cross section is directly proportional to the square of the pion form factor and bears similar qualitative features .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig5 ] . for completeness",
    ", we also present results for the dilepton production rates for various combinations of density and asymmetry parameter at @xmath97 mev in fig .",
    "evidently the medium modified pion form factor leads to enhanced production of dileptons in the low invariant mass region .    1.5 cm",
    "in the present paper we have calculated pion form factor in asymmetric nuclear matter within the framework of relativistic mean field theory valid for arbitrarily large mixing angle .",
    "it is known that the vacuum pion form factor shows a shoulder like behaviour near the @xmath0 meson pole due to its admixture with the isoscalar @xmath1 meson indicating isospin symmetry violation . in this paper , we have discussed the possible enhancement of such mixing in asymmetric nuclear matter where unlike the vacuum case , this symmetry breaking is driven by the ground state due to the difference of neutron and proton densities .",
    "automatically this would modify the pion form factor as we have shown .",
    "another interesting aspect is the shift of pole position .",
    "this is related to the presence of scalar mean field leading to the reduced nucleon mass in matter . in - medium pion form factor",
    "naturally influences the pion annililation cross section which proceeds through an intermediate @xmath0 meson .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collisions at gsi energies offers the unique opportunity to probe the in - medium pion form factor through dilepton measurements .",
    "hence we have also calculated dilepton production rate due to pion annihilation in matter . in the low mass region",
    "the dilepton yield is enhanced due to dropping of vector meson mass as well as @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing .",
    "we conclude with the comment that density and asymmetry dependent @xmath16 mixing is an interesting problem related to charge symmetry violation in matter and it could be worthwhile to extend the formalism developed in the present work to other approaches such as chiral perturbation theory and njl model which have explicit chiral symmetry .",
    "* expressions for mixing angles and pion form factor *    in this section we derive the expression for mixing angle and pion form factor for arbitrary mixing . in @xmath98 model because of the possibility of scalar - vector mixing the mixed polarization tensor has the following form in anm , @xmath99 the propagator in the presence of mixining is the solution of @xmath100 where @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "the polarization functions in @xmath105 correspond to the mixing of the pure isospin eigenstates , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this matrix can be expressed in terms of the propagators of the physical @xmath108 and @xmath17 fields which is an admixture of the pure states .",
    "this is achieved by appropriate field rotation involving various mixing angles in isospin space : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is @xmath111 mixing matrix involving density dependent mixing angles .",
    "let us first compare the polarization tensors @xmath112 and @xmath113 which have the same three momentum dependence .",
    "now since @xmath112 is a function of sum of the proton and neutron densities and @xmath113 is that of the difference , thus @xmath114 for small values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath94 .",
    "taking @xmath115 the propagator matrix takes the form :        now it is also known that the scalar - vector mixing vanishes in the limit of vanishing 3-momentum and is very small for low momentum .",
    "however , @xmath118 remains non - zero even for @xmath119 .",
    "it is also to be noted that medium dependent mixing effects are dominant only in the low momentum region which allows us to put @xmath120 in this limit  @xcite . under these assumptions",
    ", @xmath105 reduces to block diagonal form in which @xmath17 decouples from @xmath0 and @xmath1 so that we have ,          we henceforth work in the @xmath123 subspace of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i. e. we use : @xmath124 the mixing angle can be deduced by diagonalising the vector meson propagator  @xcite : @xmath125 from which we obtain @xmath126 in the small mixing angle limit the above equation reduces to @xmath127 for the derivation of pion form factor for arbitrary mixing angle we need to evaluate the matrix element for the process @xmath128 , which can be written as @xmath129 where it is assumed that @xmath130 .",
    "the physical amplitudes can be obtained from the above equation which are as follows : @xmath131    thus the amplitude for @xmath128 can be written as @xmath132 with these it is very easy to read out pion electromagnetic form factor from fig.([app_fig1 ] ) , @xmath133 which in the small angle limit reduces to eq.(20 ) .",
