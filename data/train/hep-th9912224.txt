    "this contribution deals with the `` explanation '' of the quantum properties of black holes ( and , in particular , the statistical meaning of black hole entropy ) hopefully provided by string theory .",
    "most of the stringy literature has concentrated ( for reasons recalled below ) on some special , supersymmetric extreme black holes ( bps black holes ) .",
    "[ these black holes carry special ( ramond - ramond ) charges and their microscopic structure seem to be describable in terms of dirichlet - branes . ] by contrast , we consider here the simplest , schwarzschild black holes ( in any space dimension @xmath3 ) .",

    "however , the lack of supersymmetry means that it becomes essential to deal with self - gravity effects .    to start with ,",
    "let us recall that thirty years ago the study of the spectrum of string theory revealed @xcite a huge degeneracy of states growing as an exponential of the mass .",
    "a few years later bekenstein @xcite proposed that the entropy of a black hole should be proportional to the area of its horizon in planck units , and hawking @xcite fixed the constant of proportionality after discovering that black holes do emit thermal radiation at a temperature @xmath4 .    when string and black hole entropies",
    "are compared one immediately notices a striking difference : string entropy , as the logarithm of the number of states within the band @xmath5 . ]",
    "is proportional to the first power of mass in any number of spatial dimensions @xmath3 , while black hole entropy is proportional to a @xmath3-dependent power of the mass , always larger than @xmath6 . in formulae : @xmath7 where , as usual , @xmath8 is the inverse of the classical string tension , @xmath9 is the quantum length associated with it , but , in this section , we neglect factors of order unity . ] , @xmath10 is the corresponding string mass scale , @xmath11 is the schwarzschild radius associated with @xmath0 : @xmath12 and we have used that , at least at sufficiently small coupling , the newton constant and @xmath8 are related via the string coupling by @xmath13 ( more geometrically , @xmath14 ) .    given their different mass dependence , it is obvious that , for a given set of the fundamental constants @xmath15 , @xmath16 at sufficiently small @xmath0 , while the opposite is true at sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , there has to be a critical value of @xmath0 , @xmath17 , at which @xmath18 .",
    "this observation led bowick et al .",
    "@xcite to conjecture that large black holes end up their hawking - evaporation process when @xmath19 , and then transform into a higher - entropy string state without ever reaching the singular zero - mass limit .",
    "this reasoning is confirmed @xcite by the observation that , in string theory , the fundamental string length @xmath20 should set a minimal value for the schwarzschild radius of any black hole ( and thus a maximal value for its hawking temperature ) .",
    "it was also noticed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that , precisely at @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the hawking temperature equals the hagedorn temperature of string theory . for any @xmath3",
    ", the value of @xmath17 is given by : @xmath23    susskind and collaborators , @xcite went a step further and proposed that the spectrum of black holes and the spectrum of single string states be `` identical '' , in the sense that there be a one to one correspondence between ( uncharged ) fundamental string states and ( uncharged ) black hole states .",
    "such a `` correspondence principle '' has been generalized by horowitz and polchinski @xcite to a wide range of charged black hole states ( in any dimension ) . instead of keeping fixed the fundamental constants and letting @xmath0",
    "evolve by evaporation , as considered above , one can ( equivalently ) describe the physics of this conjectured correspondence by following a narrow band of states , on both sides of and through , the string @xmath24 black hole transition , by keeping fixed the entropy , the entropy of the black hole @xmath25 stays constant .",

    "the correspondence principle then means that if one increases @xmath28 each ( quantum ) string state should turn into a ( quantum ) black hole state at sufficiently strong coupling , while , conversely , if @xmath28 is decreased , each black hole state should `` decollapse '' and transform into a string state at sufficiently weak coupling .",
    "for all the reasons mentioned above , it is very natural to expect that , when starting from a black hole state , the critical value of @xmath28 at which a black hole should turn into a string is given , in clear relation to ( [ eq1.2 ] ) , by @xmath30 and is related to the common value of string and black - hole entropy via @xmath31 note that @xmath32 for the very massive states ( @xmath33 ) that we consider .",
    "this justifies our use of the perturbative relation between @xmath34 and @xmath8 .    in the case of extremal bps , and nearly extremal , black holes the conjectured correspondence",
    "was dramatically confirmed through the work of strominger and vafa @xcite and others @xcite leading to a statistical mechanics interpretation of black - hole entropy in terms of the number of microscopic states sharing the same macroscopic quantum numbers .",

    "in fact , the process in which one starts from a string state in flat space and increases @xmath28 poses a serious puzzle @xcite .",
    "indeed , the radius of a typical excited string state of mass @xmath0 is generally thought of being of order @xmath36 as if a highly excited string state were a random walk made of @xmath37 segments of length @xmath20 @xcite . [",

    "the `` random walk '' radius ( [ eq1.5 ] ) is much larger than the schwarzschild radius for all couplings @xmath38 , or , equivalently , the ratio of self - gravitational binding energy to mass ( in @xmath3 spatial dimensions ) @xmath39 remains much smaller than one ( when @xmath40 , to which we restrict ourselves ) up to , and including , the transition point . in view of ( [ eq1.6 ] )",
    "it does not seem natural to expect that a string state will `` collapse '' to a black hole when @xmath28 reaches the value ( [ eq1.2 ] ) .",

    "their results suggest a resolution of the puzzle when @xmath43 ( four - dimensional spacetime ) , but lead to a rather complicated behaviour when @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , even in the simple @xmath43 case , the formal nature of the auxiliary `` thermal scalar '' renders unclear ( at least to me ) the physical interpretation of their analysis .    here",

    "confirm and clarify the main idea of a correspondence between string states and black hole states @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and suggest that the transition between these states is rather smooth , with no apparent hysteresis , and with continuity in entropy , mass , typical size , and luminosity .",

    "<S> i review some recent work ( done in collaboration with g.  veneziano ) which clarifies the existence of a correspondence between self - gravitating fundamental string states and schwarzschild black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is a detailed calculation showing that self - gravity causes a typical string state of mass @xmath0 to shrink , as the string coupling @xmath1 increases , down to a compact string state whose mass , size , entropy and luminosity match ( for the critical value @xmath2 ) those of a schwarzschild black hole . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the idea that the entropy of black holes can be accounted for by counting string states , and suggests that the level spacing of the quantum states of schwarzschild black holes is exponentially small , and very much blurred by radiative effects . </S>"
