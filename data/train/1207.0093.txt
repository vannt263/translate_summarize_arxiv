    "star formation is the fundamental process that shapes galaxies into different classes .",
    "although the majority of stars in the local universe are found in spheroidal systems , most of the star formation is contributed by disc galaxies of the later types ( beyond sb ) .",
    "the key ingredient for star formation is cold ( _ star - forming _ ) gas , which is present almost exclusively in disc galaxies .",
    "however , the amount of cold gas currently available in galaxy discs appears rather scant .",
    "@xcite estimated that disc galaxies have current star formation rates ranging from a few to about @xmath4 .",
    "thus , considering a typical gaseous mass of a few @xmath5 , the gas consumption time scale ( i.e.  the time needed to exhaust the gas fuel with a constant star formation rate ) is always of the order of a few gigayears .",
    "this result , known as the gas - consumption dilemma @xcite , suggests the need for continuous accretion of cold gas onto galaxy discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several pieces of evidence show that disc galaxies should collect fresh gas from the environment in order to sustain their star formation . in the milky way",
    ", the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the solar neighbourhood appears to have remained rather constant in the last @xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting a continuous replenishment of the gas supply .",
    "simple ( closed - box ) models of chemical evolution for our galaxy predict too few metal deficient _ g - dwarf _ stars than observed .",
    "these observations are easily explained by accounting for infall of fresh unpolluted gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of damped lyman alpha systems show almost no evolution in the neutral gas content of structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that this constancy of gas density can be explained assuming a rate of gas replenishment proportional to the universal sfr density .",
    "@xcite converged to a similar result when comparing the evolution of the molecular gas depletion rate with that of the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "finally , the derivations of sfhs for galaxies with different stellar masses consistently show that late type systems do have a rather constant sfr throughout the whole hubble time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these findings , other than being the signature of _ downsizing _ in cosmic structures , point at a continuous infall of gas onto galaxies of late hubble types .    the way gas accretion into galaxies takes place is still a matter of debate . the classical picture states that thermal instabilities should cause the cooling of the hot coronae that surround disc galaxies and be the source of cold gas infall .",
    "however , recent studies have shown that , due to a combination of buoyancy and thermal conduction , hot coronae turn out to be remarkably stable and thermal instability does not appear to be a viable mechanism for gas accretion @xcite . on the other hand , accretion may take place in the form of cold flows but the importance of this process is expected to drop significantly for redshift @xmath7 .",
    "observations of local gas accretion at 21-cm emission seem to show too little gas around galaxies in the form of hi  ( high - velocity ) clouds to justify an efficient feeding of the disc star formation @xcite . however , uv absorption towards quasars and halo stars point to the possibility that ionised gas at temperatures between a few 10@xmath8 and a few @xmath9 could fill the gap between expectations and data .    in this paper , we estimate gas accretion in galactic discs indirectly by comparing basic physical properties of galaxies today .",
    "our model relies on the existence of a law relating the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) and the gas surface density ( @xmath10 ) holding at every redshift , i.e.  the kennicutt - schmidt ( k - s ) law @xcite .",
    "this approach has similarities with the model of that we describe in detail in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "the evolution of gas and stellar densities ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) in a galactic disc as a function of the lookback time @xmath12 is described by the following equations @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the star formation rate density , @xmath15 is the contribution from stellar feedback and @xmath16 is the inflow / outflow rate from / to the external environment .",
    "@xmath14 gives the rate at which stars are formed or , with a sign inversion , the rate at which gas is consumed , whilst @xmath15 represents the gas density per unit time returned by stellar evolution to the gas reservoir in the disc .",
    "we treat the stellar feedback with the instantaneous recycling approximation ( i.r.a . ) , meaning that the fractional mass that stars return to the ism at each time is assumed to be constant and equal to the return factor @xmath17 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : tinsley1])-([eq : tinsley2 ] ) modify as follows : @xmath18 in section [ sec : nonira ] we discuss the effect of a delayed return .    the parameter @xmath17 in eqs .",

    "low - mass stars are assumed to leave remnants with masses between @xmath24 and @xmath25 m@xmath22 , with a linear dependency from the initial mass ( see chapter 2 of * ? ? ? * for details ) . assuming a salpeter imf , our fiducial value for the recycling parameter is @xmath26 .",
    "assuming kroupa @xcite or chabrier @xcite imfs would make little difference , giving @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 for a flatter high - mass slope ) respectively . with this value",
    "the gas consumption timescales are extended by a factor @xmath30 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the third term on the rhs of eq .  ( [ eq : tinsley2 ] ) is the inflow / outflow term . the combination of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tinsley1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tinsley2 ] ) leads to an expression for this term : @xmath31 in the following we often refer to this term as the accretion ( or infall ) rate .",
    "equations ( [ eq : tinsley1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tinsley2 ] ) can be applied to a galactic disc assuming that they are valid at each radius , i.e.  that the disc can be divided into annuli that evolve independently .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to say that stars that form at a certain radius remain at that radius for the lifetime of the galactic disc . in section [ sec : migration ]",

( [ eq : tinsley1 ] ) from @xmath32 ( the lookback time at the disc formation ) to @xmath33 to get the current stellar surface density .",
    "clearly , in order to solve the above system one needs the @xmath14 as a function of lookback time and radius , i.e.  the sfh as a function of radius . in the milky way , the sfh is known with fairly good precision only in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", a precise determination of @xmath34 is beyond the capability of the current data .",
    "therefore , for the time being , we must content ourselves with using simple parametrisations for the shape of the sfh . in the following section",
    "we describe how we estimate the trend of the sfh at each radius in a galactic disc .",
    "we consider only the disc , leaving aside the bulge / bar , which may have formed and evolved differently as it shows a markedly different sfh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the sfh in a galaxy disc can be described by a dimensionless and positive function @xmath35 .",

    "a value of @xmath40 equal to unity represents a constant sfr over the disc lifetime , @xmath42 describes a sfr that increases ( decreases ) with increasing lookback time . would imply a lower formation time at that radius ; this occurance does not arise with our choice of parameters . ]",
    "the dependence of @xmath43 on the radius @xmath44 allows us to describe different shapes of sfh within the disc . in section [ sec : fs ] we discuss the effect of taking different forms for @xmath38 , we anticipate that our main results remain unchanged .",

    "@xmath43 for a galactic disc as : @xmath45 where the integration is performed out to the maximum radius @xmath46 ; the denominator is just the current sfr of the disc .",

    "this fit shows that the sfr density of the universe as a whole is described by a value of @xmath43 much larger than unity , as expected given that the sfr density in the past was much higher than now .",
    "the shape of the universal sfr density is produced by the combined contribution of galaxies with very different sfhs .",
    "massive red - sequence galaxies dominate the overall sfr at high - z , whilst late - type galaxies become relatively more and more important as time passes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although our parametrisation is only suitable for galaxies with non - negligible current sfr , taking @xmath43 as the ratio of @xmath52 , clearly red sequence galaxies must have @xmath53 .    the above assumptions for the sfrd ( eqs .",

    "[ eq : gammar ] reveals that our parameter @xmath40 is ultimately a ratio between the stellar density and the current sfrd , given a certain formation time for the disc , which is of the order of the hubble time and can be assumed roughly equal for all discs .",

    "integrating @xmath40 over the disc and making used of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammadef ] ) we find an expression for the global @xmath43 as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are respectively the current stellar mass and star formation rate of the entire disc .",
    "clearly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , one can also describe @xmath43 as proportional to the ratio between the average past sfr and the current sfr .",
    "this latter is the inverse of the so - called scalo @xmath59-parameter @xcite to which @xmath43 is closely related ( see section [ sec : things ] ) .",
    "we also note that any modification of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f1 ] ) with power law terms of @xmath60 would produce the same dependencies for @xmath43 as eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammar ] ) .",
    "we discuss these points further in section [ sec : fs ] .",
    "the main ingredient of our model is the relation between the rate of star formation and the gas density .",
    "the empirical star formation law is broadly accepted to be a power - law relation between the `` cold '' gas density and the star formation rate density @xcite .",
    "this relation has been tested on global ( i.e. averaging gas and star formation on the whole disc ) and local scales @xcite considering the molecular gas or the sum of atomic and molecular gas .",
    "remarkably , it appears to hold across various orders of magnitudes , from quiescent discs to star - busting galaxies @xcite .",
    "the dependence on gas metallicity is difficult to investigate due to the related dependency of the x@xmath61 factor @xcite .",
    "however , the compilation of azimuthal averages of sfrd and @xmath10 presented by @xcite for the things sample , which includes galaxies with very different masses and presumably different metallicities , seems to show that the effect is limited ( see * ? ? ? * and section [ sec : others ] ) .",
    "thus , in the following we assume the following star formation law : @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 if @xmath10 is measured in @xmath65 and sfrd in @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "note that the above value of @xmath67 takes into account the correction for the presence of helium ( a factor 1.36 in mass ) , not applied in @xcite .",
    "deviations from the above relation are observed at column densities lower than @xmath68 , referred to as the density threshold .",
    "below these densities the law steepens and the scatter increases making it more difficult to describe @xcite . in the context of this paper",
    ", it may have an effect in the outer parts of the discs ( see sections [ sec : mw ] and [ sec : others ] ) .",
    "@xcite have recently pointed out that the star formation law expressed in terms of volume density is more general than the one expressed in terms of surface density .",
    "this is very relevant to understand the physical origin of the law and to perform numerical simulations .",
    "however , for our investigation a surface - density law is far more practical . clearly , the choices are equivalent if in the region of interest , i.e.  within the star forming disc , the scale - height of the gaseous disc does not change much as a function of radius . the validity of this condition ( within a factor 2 ) is well established in our galaxy , as the disc appears to be flaring significantly only beyond @xmath69 .",

    "( [ eq : garf1_1 ] ) or ( [ eq : garf1_2 ] ) over the disc out to our maximum radius @xmath46 .",
    "it is evident that the global accretion rate will have dependencies similar to those of the local one and the above considerations apply . in particular , for galaxies with @xmath43 of order unity , the global infall rate closely follows the @xmath82 at every time @xmath83 .",

    "we have tried to quantify the above effect by assuming a different star formation law for low density environments . to this aim , we broke the star formation law into two parts : we assumed that the standard k - s is valid only down to a break surface density of 10 @xmath65 in hydrogen , below which the law takes a different form .",
    "we took this form from the work of @xcite who studied a compilation of extremely faint ( and presumably metal poor ) dwarf galaxies and found that a normalization of @xmath180 and a slope of @xmath181 are suitable for these low density environments .",

    "the main difference is the evolution of the stellar - disc scalelength , which evolves qualitatively in the same way but quantitatively much less in our treatment , i.e.  our disc has initially @xmath191 as opposed to @xmath192 in their model ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "the sfrs in the solar neighbourhood are slightly different but both comparable with the determination of @xcite .",

    "our treatment does not include metallicity information but it is clear that the infalling gas is bound to be at low metallicity .",
    "the need for metal - deficient accretion has been shown and confirmed throughout the last decades starting from pioneering works such as and @xcite .",
    "more recently it has become clear that one needs two epochs of gas infall : one at the early epochs and one slower and still ongoing , which is the one we are describing here @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of this gas should be fairly low , of order @xmath194 or less ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of this accretion is still matter of debate and it is beyond the scope of this paper . as mentioned , several numerical investigations show that cooling of the hot corona may provide a reasonable amount of gas accretion onto the milky - way disc , although at a relative low rate @xcite .",
    "these simulations roughly reproduce also the kinematics of this gas @xcite and the radial distribution of the accretion @xcite .",
    "however , the whole mechanism of direct cooling via thermal instability has been recently challenged both by analytical analyses @xcite and by recent grid - based simulations @xcite and the matter is still not settled .",
    "our accretion is smooth but this is obviously an artifact of our assumptions . in principle",
    "the main contribution to gas infall could be minor mergers with gas rich satellites , which would give presumably a more bursty sfh . in this sense ,",
    "our analysis is still applicable if one averages all quantities over a time larger than the typical starburst timescale .",
    "current hi  observations seem to show that the amount of gas that can be realistically brought into large galaxies by gaseous satellites in the local universe is rather low @xcite .",
    "however , these estimates are still uncertain and only future hi  surveys will allow us to determine the accretion from mergers with the required accuracy .",
    "a recent analysis of the contribution of satellites to the gas accretion in the milky way shows that they would also not reproduce the distribution of sfr observed today @xcite .",
    "finally , we found that accretion and star formation proceed together .",

    "this finding may just highlight the obvious point that the more a galaxy accretes gas the more stars it forms .",
    "however , the regularity of this link seems to point at a more fundamental interplay between star formation and accretion ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "in a series of papers it has been suggested that gas accretion in discs is fundamentally related to star formation because it is produced by supernova ( _ positive _ ) feedback .",
    "supernovae eject ( high - metallicity ) gas clouds out of galactic discs mixing it with the surrounding hot corona and causing prompt cooling of the latter .",
    "this implies an accretion that follows closely the star formation in the disc and proceeds from inside out given the distribution of cloud orbits .",
    "@xcite applied this model to the milky way and found a global accretion rate of @xmath195 .",
    "they also found that the current accretion profile is an increasing function of the radius out to a peak at @xmath196 followed by a sudden drop further out . in this paper , we found a similar shape but with a peak located closer in , see fig .",
    "[ fig : peak ] .",
    "however , as mentioned , our approach traces the location where the new gas forms stars .",
    "so it is conceivable that the infall took place at slightly larger radii , and then it flowed quiescently in .",
    "it is compelling that two completely independent methods as these produce such similar accretion patterns and global gas accretion rates .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a simple method to derive the amount of gas needed for the star formation to proceed in a galactic disc , using the kennicutt - schmidt law .",
    "we found that in typical disc galaxies ( sb or later types ) most star - forming gas is not in place in the disc at the time of formation but needs to be slowly acquired from the surrounding environment .",
    "we derived the gas accretion rate as a function of time for the milky way and other 21 disc galaxies from the things sample .",
    "we parametrized the sfh with a simple polynomial function with a parameter ( @xmath43 ) that defines the slope of the sfh , @xmath197 stands for a flat sfh .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    1 .   the disc of the milky way as a whole ( not only the solar neighborhood ) formed stars in the past a rate that was @xmath198 times larger than now ; 2 .",
    "the steepness of the sfh is a function of galaxy mass and hubble type , with late type galaxies having nearly flat or inverted sfh ; 3 .",
    "gas accretion is tightly linked to star formation , a constant ratio between the two is maintained for a large fraction of the life of a galaxy , pointing at a reciprocal interplay ; 4 .",
    "galaxy discs must have experienced accretion of large fraction of their mass ( in gaseous form ) after @xmath1 , unless the k - s law had a strong evolution with @xmath199 ; 5 .",
    "gas accretion progressively moves from the inner to the outer regions of galaxy discs , as a consequence star formation also proceeds inside - out ; 6 .",
    "the efficiency of gas accretion is less than 1 and decreases with time in all galaxies expect some late - type dwarfs , as a consequence the gas consumed by star formation is not completely replenished and the galaxy eventually stops forming stars ; 7 .",

    "<S> we show how the existence of a relation between the star formation rate and the gas density , i.e.  the kennicutt - schmidt law , implies a continuous accretion of fresh gas from the environment into the discs of spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we present a method to derive the gas infall rate in a galaxy disc as a function of time and radius , and we apply it to the disc of the milky way and 21 galaxies from the things sample . for the milky way , we found that the ratio between the past and current star formation rates is about @xmath0 , averaged over the disc , but it varies substantially with radius . in the other disc galaxies there is a clear dependency of this ratio with galaxy stellar mass and hubble type , with more constant star formation histories for small galaxies of later type . </S>",
    "<S> the gas accretion rate follows very closely the sfr for every galaxy and it dominates the evolution of these systems . </S>",
    "<S> the milky way has formed two thirds of its stars after @xmath1 , whilst the mass of cold gas in the disc has remained fairly constant with time . in general , all discs have accreted a significant fraction of their gas after @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> accretion moves from the inner regions of the disc to the outer parts , and as a consequence star formation moves inside - out as well . at @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> the peak of gas accretion in the galaxy is at about @xmath3 from the centre .    </S>",
