    "one of the most significant topics of research is x - rays emission in the galactic center ( gc ) region , particularly the k - shell emission lines of neutral iron ( hereafter , the -k lines ) from the giant molecular clouds ( mcs : @xcite ) in sagittarius b ( sgr b ) , located at @xmath2   on the galactic plane .",
    "x - rays and the  k lines from sgr b were first detected by the @xmath3/art - p telescope ( @xcite ) and the asca satellite ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the mcs are extremely cold , and hence can not self - excite neutral irons to a higher level in order to emit the -k lines . the origin of -k lines has been a mystery . from laboratory experiments ,",
    "two plausible origins have been proposed : the fluorescence after inner - shell ionization by the injection of electrons or emission of x - rays with energies greater than 7.1 kev ( the minimum ionization energy of ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the mcs , which show a strong absorption edge at 7.1 kev together with intense -k@xmath4 ( l- to k - shell transition ) and -k@xmath5 ( m- to k - shell transition ) lines , support the x - ray origin rather than the electron origin ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray origin was established by the recent discovery of rapid ( order of several years ) time - variability of -k lines @xcite , and from the fact that only photons can produce such rapid variability in the mcs with size of the order of 10 light - years .",
    "increase in the rapid time variability of the -k lines from other mcs near the gc has been discovered @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the mcs have only been illuminated by an external x - ray source .",
    "furthermore , time variability in the continuum x - ray was found by muno et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in the x - ray fluorescent origin , thomson scattered x - rays",
    "are also predicted in the hard x - ray band .",
    "in fact , the x - rays detected by @xcite were the thomson scattered component .",
    "@xcite discovered time variable hard x - rays ( 2060 kev ) originating from the sgr  b2 region .",
    "in addition , muno et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found flickering continuum x - ray emissions from small clouds near the gc .",
    "accordingly , x - rays from the clouds may be called  x - ray echoes . ",
    "-k lines and hard continuum x - rays are due to fluorescence and the thomson scattering of external x - rays , respectively @xcite .",
    "the  x - ray echoes  can easily produce apparent superluminal propagation , as ponti et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found in the mcs near the gc ( sunyaev & churazov 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of these clouds is @xmath6  erg  s@xmath1 , and hence an illuminating object should be much brighter ( @xmath7  erg  s@xmath1 ; sunyaev & churazov 1998 ; murakami et al .",
    "one proposed scenario is that sgr a * , the super - massive black hole with around four million solar masses in the gc located at a distance of several hundred light - years from the mcs @xcite , was bright several hundred years ago with an x - ray luminosity millions times higher than the present luminosity of 10@xmath810@xmath9  erg  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the increase and decrease in the x - ray emission from the mcs may suggest intermittent activities of sgr  a * several hundred years ago ( inui et al . 2009 ; ponti et al . 2010 ) .",
    "however , because the required luminosity of the external x - ray source depends on the distance to the mcs , the duration of x - ray irradiation , and the size and density of the mcs , the currently available data does not exclude the possibility of intense x - ray flares from near - by transient sources .",
    "recently , ponti et al . (",
    "2010 ) discovered superluminal motion in the -k emission from the mcs near the gc @xmath10 and estimated that a large luminosity of @xmath11  erg  s@xmath1 , which is almost equal to the eddington luminosity for a stellar mass object was required for illumination .",
    "they concluded that the past flare of sgr a * had illuminated the mcs .",
    "however , for other mcs emitting  k , particularly , those in sgr  b , there is no clear evidence that sgr a * was the only candidate for their illumination source .",
    "this paper provides clear evidence for the scenario of a past large - flare of sgr a*.    the errors in the estimation in this paper are at the 1@xmath12 confidence level .",
    "the distance to the gc is assumed to be the canonical value of 26,000 light - years ( @xcite ) . because we use the galactic coordinate system , we define  east  and  west  as the positive and negative galactic longitude sides , respectively .",
    "to identify the external x - ray source for the  x - ray echo , ",
    "sgr b2 would be the best target because ( i ) it is one of the brightest x - ray echo sources , ( ii ) its three - dimensional position is well determined @xcite , and ( iii ) the galactic center diffuse x - ray emission ( gcdx : @xcite ) is relatively small and uniform .",
    "therefore , possible contamination from the gcdx can be reliably subtracted .",
    "we observed the sgr b region with the x - ray ccd cameras the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) aboard the suzaku satellite @xcite . to examine time variability ,",
    "the observations were performed twice in october 2005 and september 2009 , at identical pointing positions within 4 .",
    "the sequence numbers for the two observations are 100037060 and 504004020 .",
    "the effective exposure times in 2005 and 2009 were 21.3  h and 56.1  h , respectively .",
    "four xis ( xis0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) and three xis ( xis0 , 1 , and 3 ) cameras were available in 2005 and 2009 , respectively .",
    "we discarded the data obtained in a one - fourth field ( segment a ) of xis0 for both observations because it has become nonfunctional since june 2008 .",
    "although the effective energy range of xis is 0.210 kev , we used the 410 kev band data for the spectral analysis .",
    "this is because soft x - rays from the target ( sgr  b ) are absorbed by the interstellar medium toward the gc region .",
    "we obtained the data for non - x - ray background ( nxb ) caused by the cosmic - rays using _ xisnxbgen _",
    "( @xcite ) and then subtracted the nxb from the observed data .",
    "we then corrected the local differences of the effective area for the data analysis ( the vignetting correction ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : image]a shows the x - ray images for the -k@xmath4 ( 6.4 kev ) line of the sgr b region in 2005 , where bright diffuse sources are clearly detected @xcite .",
    "according to a previous work @xcite , we hereafter refer to the two sources as sgr  b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 .",
    "figure  [ fig : image]b shows the same image taken four years later in 2009 . comparing the two images , we observe that the two bright sources have darkened in the four years , whereas there is no significant change in the brightness of the surrounding region .    in addition , figure  1c and 1d show the hard x - ray images of the sgr b region in the 810  kev band for the 2005 and 2009 observations , respectively . as shown in figure  [ fig : image]c , hard x - ray excesses at the positions of sgr b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 in 2005",
    "are observed .",
    "this is the first resolved hard x - ray image of sgr b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 , although in the past x - ray observation , the hard x - ray excess near sgr b2 has been found with an insufficient special resolution of 12  @xcite . on the other hand , the hard x - ray fluxes from these mcs",
    "are almost comparable to those of the surrounding areas and hence no significant hard x - ray excesses are found in the 2009 data ( figure  [ fig : image]d ) .",
    "the significance levels of the hard x - rays from sgr  b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 with respect to the background region shown by the white dashed line are 5 and 4@xmath12 in 2005 and @xmath14 in 2009 , respectively .",
    "these facts suggest that the hard x - rays from sgr b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 decreased from 2005 to 2009 in correlation with the decrease in the -k fluxes .",
    "we investigate the x - ray spectra to study the time variability more quantitatively .",
    "the regions selected for the sgr  b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 spectra are indicated with the white solid lines in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the background region is also shown with white dashed lines , where the dashed small circle in which an mc might be emitting faint -k is excluded .",
    "figures  [ fig : spec]a and [ fig : spec]b are the background - subtracted spectra of sgr b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 , respectively .",
    "the spectra in 2005 and 2009 are shown by black and red crosses , respectively . as seen in both spectra ,",
    "the fluxes of the -k@xmath4 lines and the hard continuum have simultaneously decreased from 2005 to 2009 .",
    "we fit the spectra with a phenomenological model of an absorbed power - law and the -k@xmath4 and -k@xmath5 lines at 6.4 kev and 7.06 kev , respectively .",
    "a supernova remnants candidate g0.61 + 0.01 @xcite is located 4  away from sgr b2 and may slightly contaminate the sgr b2 spectrum .",
    "therefore , we consider the contamination of the thermal plasma of g0.61 + 0.01 by adding a plasma model @xcite with a fixed temperature of 37 million k and an iron abundance of @xmath15@xmath165.1 solar @xcite",
    ". the contamination is then found to be less than 10% , and hence the error due to the possible uncertainty of flux contamination can be neglected .",
    "the four spectra ( sgr b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 for 2005 and 2009 ) are simultaneously fitted with the free parameters of the absorption column density @xmath17 , the iron abundance @xmath15 , the photon index @xmath18 , and the fluxes of the continuum and the -k lines . among them , only @xmath15  and @xmath18  are set to be common for all spectra .",
    "the fit is acceptable with chi@xmath19/d.o.f . of 216/217 ( null hypothesis probability @xmath20 ) .",
    "the best - fit common parameters of @xmath15  and @xmath18  are 1.3@xmath210.3 solar and 2.5@xmath210.6 solar , respectively , and those of the other free parameters are listed in table  [ tab : ana1 ] .",
    "we find that the fluxes of the -k@xmath4 lines and the hard continuum band for sgr  b2 decrease by a factor of 0.39@xmath210.04 and 0.49@xmath210.09 from 2005 to 2009 , respectively .",
    "these variation factors are consistent within the 1@xmath12 confidence level with the mean value of 0.41@xmath210.04 .",
    "the variation factors of 0.53@xmath210.07 ( -k@xmath4 lines ) and 0.53@xmath210.13 ( continuum band ) for m0.74@xmath130.09 are also consistent with the mean value of 0.53@xmath210.06 .",

    "on the basis of the 2005 data , we confirmed that the two mcs ( sgr  b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 ) exhibit intense -k lines .",
    "in addition , we resolved the hard continuum emission from sgr b2 detected by @xmath3 and integral @xcite into emissions from two mcs .",
    "the most important discovery is that the correlated decrease in the four years between the -k lines and the hard continuum is synchronized in the two mcs , although @xcite reported a correlated decrease in the entire sgr  b region . because the data for these results are obtained with the same instrument ( _ suzaku_/xis ) and an identical pointing field , the possible systematic errors are minimized .",
    "the correlation of the variability between the two mcs and the two components ( -k lines and hard continuum ) indicate that they are of common origin .",
    "as we have already discussed , the origin is likely to be x - ray irradiation by an external source (  x - ray echo  ) .",
    "then , the equivalent width of the -k@xmath4 lines ( ew@xmath27 ) is expressed as 1.0@xmath28(@xmath15/1 solar )  kev @xcite . as",
    "the observed ew@xmath27 is 1.01.5 kev , we derive the iron abundance as @xmath15@xmath161.01.5  solar .",
    "the absorption column density @xmath17  of about 10@xmath29 @xmath23 is significantly larger than the value of 10@xmath30  @xmath23 for typical sources in the gc @xcite , and hence , the major fraction would be owing to the absorption in the mcs .",
    "the iron absorption edge depth at 7.1  kev gives the iron abundance in the mcs of @xmath15@xmath31 solar , which is consistent with that derived from ew@xmath27 .",
    "these facts firmly support the  x - ray echo  for the x - ray emission from sgr b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 : the fluorescent -k line and the thomson - scattered hard - continuum .",
    "we found that the fluxes of sgr b2 and m0.74@xmath130.09 had reduced by factors of 0.41@xmath210.4 and 0.53@xmath210.6 during the four years , respectively .",
    "this result shows that the decrease in -k emission from 2000 to 2005 found by previous works @xcite had continued at least until 2009 .",
    "@xcite reported that the decrease rate of the -k emission is @xmath320.6 in five years ( 20002005 ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray fluxes had decreased by a factor of @xmath33 during the decade .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed a decay of up to 0.4 in a hard x - ray flux from 2003 to 2009 , which is almost consistent with our result for the hard continuum .",
    "the schematic view of the `` x - ray echo '' scenario is shown in figure  [ fig : time - delay ] .",
    "as the incident x - ray flare moves at light speed in the mcs , the echo spot also moves at light speed .",
    "because the density of the mcs is not uniform , the brightness of the x - ray echoes would be higher in high - density regions than in low - density regions .",
    "the x - ray echoes in 2005 was produced in high - density regions and then moved into low - density regions in 2009 .",
    "@xcite proposed that the flare lasted for a large duration of @xmath34  years ( long flare ) . in the long flare scenario ,",
    "is was suggested that the mcs in the sgr b2 region were illuminated by x - rays at the end of the long flare . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite indicated that a single shorter flare can explain the x - ray light curve of sgr b2 .",
    "we do not yet have enough data to determine the probable scenario .    the required luminosity ( @xmath35 ) of the x - ray flare to produce the  x - ray echo  of the mcs depends on the time duration ( @xmath36 ) of the flare , the distances ( @xmath37 ) to the mcs , and the optical depths ( @xmath38 ) along the x - ray pass band in the mcs .",
    "in particular , @xmath35  also depends on the density profiles and the sizes of mcs .",
    "the mc sizes may be @xmath3210 light years , almost equal to those in the selected regions shown in figure  [ fig : image ] . using the observed @xmath17  of about 10@xmath29  @xmath23",
    ", @xmath38 is estimated to be about 0.1 .",
    "then , for the two cases of long flare @xmath39  years and short flare @xmath40  years , we can estimate @xmath35  from @xcite as follows : @xmath41    using radio observations , @xcite indicated that the x - ray peak shifted from the mc core to the east direction by @xmath42 ; therefore , the x - ray flare source should be located on the west side of sgr b2 .",
    "moreover , the minimum value of the required luminosity is given when the flare - source is near the west - rim of sgr b2 .",
    "in this case , the distance @xmath37 to the other mc , m0.74@xmath130.09 is about 0.1or 50 light - years ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "the minimum value of the required luminosity is @xmath35@xmath43  erg  s@xmath1 . as equation  ( [ eq : reqiredlumin ] )",
    "is derived from simple assumptions and approximations , some uncertainties exist in @xmath35@xmath44  erg  s@xmath1 , but the errors should not be larger than one order of magnitude .",
    "the most conservative value of @xmath35  is @xmath45  erg  s@xmath1 , which is almost equal to that of the brightest x - ray sources in our galaxy . because we did not find such stable sources in the gc , one possible candidate is a transient x - ray binary system .",
    "x - ray monitoring in the gc has been conducted since almost 10 years with the _ integral _ satellite @xcite .",
    "all bright transient sources exhibited peak luminosities lower than a few times of 10@xmath46  erg  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the flare durations ( @xmath36 ) are shorter than 0.1 years @xcite .",
    "the average luminosity of the transient sources over 10 years is a few times of @xmath47  erg  s@xmath1 , which is 10 times lower than the minimum required luminosity by the most conservative estimation .",
    "these facts indicate that the transient binary system is an unlikely candidate for the irradiation source .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the large - flare of sgr a * , the super - massive black hole , is the irradiation source .",
    "the large flare with a luminosity of more than @xmath48  erg  s@xmath1 might have occurred a few hundred years ago . at present , the x - ray luminosity of sgr a * is about @xmath49  erg  s@xmath1 and it exhibits numerous flares .",
    "however , the flare scales are relatively small and their luminosity can at most reach 180 times that of the quiescent level @xcite . the large flare predicted in this study , which is more than 10@xmath50 times",
    "the largest flare observed until now , would be new evidence for past high activity of the super - massive black hole at the center of our galaxy .",
