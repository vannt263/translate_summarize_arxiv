    "note that @xmath174 must have at least two leaves , since otherwise , the unique leaf would be labeled @xmath36 , and there is no smaller @xmath193 that also contains @xmath36 .",
    "hence we can split @xmath174 into two subsets @xmath194 and @xmath195 satisfying @xmath196 , i.e.  @xmath197 .",
    "let us first consider the case when @xmath173 contains at least two elements . since the split @xmath173 is bicolored , @xmath173 contains both marked and unmarked leaves . in this case",
    "we swap subtrees of @xmath120 in the following way to obtain @xmath187 .",
    "we replace the split @xmath198 in @xmath120 by the split @xmath199 to obtain a new tree @xmath187 .",
    "the split @xmath200 is not in the tree @xmath192 because @xmath189 . by our assumption",
    "we know that @xmath201 contains both marked and unmarked ends .",
    "as @xmath63 is marked and @xmath36 is unmarked and in @xmath195 , @xmath202 contains both marked and unmarked ends , too .",
    "as all other splits of @xmath187 are splits of @xmath120 , too , we conclude @xmath185 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath203 , because @xmath204 .    now let us consider the case when @xmath173 contains exactly one element .",
    "then @xmath120 has the form :        where @xmath205 have the same color , and @xmath206 either contains a leaf of different color or a single leaf @xmath207 of the same color . in the first case",
    ", we swap the split @xmath208 with @xmath209 . in the latter case",
    ", we swap @xmath208 with @xmath210 .",
    "this new tree @xmath187 is smaller than @xmath120 .",
    "note that @xmath211 may be @xmath96 .",
    "however , we can not have the following configuration because there is no smaller tree @xmath212 that agrees with @xmath120 above and to the right of the vertex @xmath13 :        we want to prove that @xmath192 can not contain the edge label @xmath213 .",
    "assume it does .",
    "as @xmath214 , @xmath215 .",
    "thus @xmath216 can only consist of a subset of @xmath217 .",
    "but as all @xmath218 have the same color , @xmath216 can contain at most one to be a bicolored split .",
    "thus @xmath219\\setminus\\{1,m_i\\}$ ] for some @xmath220 .",
    "but as @xmath221 , @xmath219\\setminus\\{1,m_i\\}>[n]\\setminus    \\{1,m_0\\}$ ] which is a contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath222 and we choose @xmath223 .    in @xcite , it was shown that @xmath224 is shellable for all @xmath1 and a shelling order called `` snake ordering '' is given .",

    "in this section , we will use the shelling to compute the homology . we have to count those trees",
    "@xmath225 which `` close a loop , '' i.e.  for each @xmath226 there exists @xmath227 , @xmath184 such that @xmath228 . in the proof of corollary 5 of @xcite , it was shown that a tree with an internal left edge does not satisfy this condition , so all left edges must be leaves .",

    "however , not all of them contribute to the homology because the existence of a tree @xmath184 with @xmath229 does not guarantee that @xmath227 .    let @xmath120 be a @xmath37-valent tree and @xmath13 be an internal vertex , such that the two children of @xmath13 are the end @xmath230 and a bounded edge leading to a vertex @xmath231 which has the end @xmath232 as child .",

    "we have to show that for those combs we can find @xmath192 for each edge label @xmath240 .",
    "there are two cases : either @xmath240 is an edge between two marked ( unmarked ) ends @xmath237 and @xmath238 with @xmath241 , or @xmath237 is marked and @xmath242 unmarked ( respectively , the other way round ) . in the first case , we just swap @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "the new tree @xmath192 is still in @xmath22 .",
    "it contains all edge labels of @xmath120 besides the edge label @xmath243 . instead of @xmath240",

    "the edge label @xmath245 is replaced by @xmath246 .",
    "all other edge labels remain . of course , @xmath227 .",

    "it follows from the previous lemma that the rank of the top homology is the number of ways to simultaneously partition an @xmath249-element set and a @xmath250-element set into the same number of nonempty ordered parts .",
