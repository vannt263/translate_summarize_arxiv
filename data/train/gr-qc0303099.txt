    "the idea of a totally collapsed gravitational source , from which nothing  not even light  can escape , is an old one , dating back at least to the work of laplace ( and others ) in the eighteenth century @xcite .",
    "since those original considerations , research has uncovered a wealth of understanding regarding the physics of black holes . in general , the work has followed two major routes , with an ever - narrowing gap between the approaches . along one direction ,",
    "black holes are studied as mathematical solutions in a given theory of gravity including newtonian theory , post - newtonian metric theories of gravity , einsteinian gravity , as well as semi - classical and ( more recently ) various attempts at full quantum theories of gravity .",
    "the second direction considers black holes in the astrophysical and astronomical contexts .",
    "both fields of research have seen increasing activity over the years and have made startling discoveries concerning the physics of black holes ; including the gravitational collapse theory of oppenheimer and snyder @xcite , proofs of uniqueness and stability of black holes in einstein s general relativity @xcite , thermodynamic properties of black holes including the three laws of black hole mechanics @xcite and mechanisms for black hole radiation and evaporation @xcite , discovery of critical phenomena in black hole formation @xcite , experimental identification of both astrophysical black hole sources themselves @xcite and their event horizons @xcite , experimental signatures for super - massive black holes in galactic centers @xcite , and experimental bounds on the distribution and spectrum of black hole sources and collisions @xcite .",
    "numerical relativity , which addresses computational solution of einstein s equation @xcite , is an active participant in both the mathematical and the astrophysical programmes of research . with the advent of the laser interferometric gravitational observatory and other similar efforts ,",
    "considerable attention has focused on the generic binary black hole coalescence ( bbhc ) problem , expected as the strongest sources for gravitational waves @xcite . as discussed in @xcite , this is a very difficult and interesting problem that can only successfully be addressed in the computational domain .",
    "consequently , the binary black hole coalescence problem has become an active subject of numerical relativity .",
    "one particular problem in the computational domain is the computational definition , detection and tracking of the black hole event horizon itself @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the present work completely solves the problem of numerically tracking black hole event horizons .",
    "the solution is complete in the sense that a single method is presented such that any one implementation of the method can generically detect arbitrary numbers of black hole event horizons undergoing arbitrarily strong gravitational interactions .",
    "for example , using a single computational code of our method we analyse both single black holes and black holes undergoing merger ; and no special modifications of our code are required to handle these distinct dynamics .",
    "the present article , describing our generic method for tracking black hole event horizons , is divided as follows . in section",
    "ii the eikonal equation , the foundation of our method , is described in sufficient detail to be employed in an event horizon tracker . in particular , we focus on the signature behavior of a black hole event horizon in solutions of the eikonal equation . as usual in numerical work",
    ", there are a variety of possible implementations of the approach . in section iii ,",
    "several closely related systems of equations are presented and one particular system is singled out for consideration .",
    "the system chosen makes use of an explicit second order diffusion , or viscosity , term and we show in section iii the relationship between solutions of the diffusive equations of motion and the continuum eikonal equation of interest .",
    "section iv details extraction of the two dimensional sections of the event horizon for each time level of a numerical evolution .",
    "such extraction is crucial for carrying out area , mass , and spin calculations .",
    "section iv also shows the accuracy of our implementation by considering a parameter space survey of single kerr black holes .",
    "sections v - x describe in detail the first three dimensional application of our ( or any ) method to the numerical analysis of the asymmetric binary black hole coalescence problem .",
    "in particular we search for evidence of any nontrivial topology of the horizon immediately following merger . in distinction to the prediction of @xcite we find a topologically spherical horizon to within the accuracy of our three dimensional mesh .",
    "further , area analysis of the candidate numerical event horizon is carried out in conjunction with analysis of the black hole apparent horizons , which reveals both a time of merger much earlier then estimated using apparent horizons and mass energy estimates much larger those found using apparent horizon tracking methods .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section xi .",
    "to begin , since the lagrangian @xmath0 of null geodesic motion has only kinetic terms it is equal to the associated hamiltonian ; mid - latin indices denote spatial components @xmath1 . ] .",
    "legendre transformation @xmath2 where @xmath3 sets @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian equations are @xmath5 @xmath6    it is generic that the spacetime metric is independent of the affine parameter @xmath7 .",
    "there is thus a first integral associated to geodesic motion . making use of this property permits elimination of the affine parameter in favor of coordinate time @xmath8 . to see this , it is convenient to adopt the adm variables @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the inverse spatial metric .",
    "substituting the adm variables directly into the hamiltonian gives @xmath11 since the hamiltonian is not explicitly @xmath7 dependent there is a constant of the motion @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15 the motion is said to be timelike , null , or spacelike . without loss of generality , assuming null geodesic motion , solution of ( [ geodesics ] ) by ordinary algebra yields : @xmath16 with this result , the hamiltonian can be explicitly factored : @xmath17 where @xmath18 in the case of either root hamilton s canonical equations become @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 according to equation ( [ teq ] ) , @xmath7 can be eliminated in favor of @xmath8 .",
    "the system of equations becomes simply the equations ( [ 2eq ] ) and ( [ 4eq ] ) with @xmath8 written in place of @xmath7 and the factor @xmath23 cancelled everywhere on the right hand side .",
    "explicitly , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the eikonal , corresponding to the hamiltonian of equation ( [ 6eq ] ) , @xmath26 can be factored similarly .",
    "to do so it is a simple matter of making the replacements @xmath27 , @xmath28 in ( [ p ] ) to find the following symmetric hyberbolic partial differential equation @xmath29 note that a bar is introduced here to distinguish the hamiltonian used here from the hamiltonian used in ( [ 6eq ] ) .",
    "this equation is also used in the method of @xcite , although in that work the equation is further reduced to consider the case of a single null surface .",
    "the right hand side of this result is homogeneous of degree one in @xmath30 .",
    "the characteristic curves along which the level sets @xmath31 of @xmath32 are propagated , are then @xmath33 @xmath34 which are the null geodesics of equations ( [ null1 ] ) and ( [ null2 ] ) . immediately , the integral curves of the gradients of @xmath32 and @xmath31 are also the null geodesics : @xmath35    hereafter , the bar on @xmath36 is dropped with the understanding that the hamiltonian considered is that of equation ( [ pde ] ) .",
    "this result establishes that the eikonal is technically a riemann invariant of the null geodesics , a fact that proves useful in establishing the signature of a black hole event horizon in solutions of the eikonal equation .",
    "more specifically , since the eikonal is the canonical generator of null geodesics , it can be employed in analysis of black hole event horizons , which are by definition generated by null geodesics having no future end points . to proceed in this manner the equation ( [ pde ] )",
    "is employed in an initial value problem and then surveyed for signature features of black hole event horizons .",
    "a black hole event horizon is generated by a congruence of outgoing  but future asymptotically nonexpanding  null geodesics .",
    "the scope of the surveys of the eikonal equation that are required to identify a black hole event horizon is then restricted to the space of all outgoing null surfaces .",
    "these surveys are greatly reduced by the fact that solutions of the eikonal are categorized by topologically equivalent solutions . to see this , note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 by homogeneity of the right hand side of ( [ pde ] ) , if @xmath32 is a solution then @xmath39 is also solution .",
    "thus smoothly related initial data @xmath40 have smoothly related solutions .",
    "this feature alleviates the need for surveying over smoothly related initial data .",
    "a further reduction of the scope of solution surveys is provided by the equivalence of ingoing and outgoing solutions under time reversal .",
    "propagation of data for @xmath32 describing an ingoing or outgoing null surface is accomplished by specification of : 1 . a definition of the direction of time , 2 . a choice of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and 3 . a choice of the root .",
    "with these choices specified , data is then uniquely partitioned into an ingoing type and an outgoing type with the distinction being the gradient of @xmath32 .    with the dynamics of any outgoing null surface ( including the event horizon ) specified by ( [ pde ] ) , and the scope of solution surveys categorized into topological classes ,",
    "the task remains of identifying the event horizon within this restricted space of outgoing null surfaces .",
    "to do so , the results and approach of @xcite are adopted here and modified to include the eikonal equation as discussed above .",
    "the result of this approach is a signature feature of black hole event horizons in the eikonal equation .",
    "an event horizon of a black hole is by definition a critical outgoing surface when tracked into the future .",
    "let @xmath43 be a point interior to the horizon and @xmath44 be a point exterior to the horizon such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 lie on characteristic curves of the eikonal @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "at arbitrarily early times let @xmath45 and @xmath46 pass arbitrarily closely to a point @xmath47 that lies on the horizon @xmath31 . since @xmath32 is a riemann invariant , at arbitrarily early times the jump of the eikonal at @xmath47 becomes @xmath48\\right ] \\equiv",
    "s_{-}\\left(\\mathcal{h}\\right ) - s_{+}\\left(\\mathcal{h}\\right ) \\approx",
    "s\\left(\\mathcal{p}\\right ) - s\\left(\\mathcal{q}\\right ) \\neq 0 $ ] . in the computational domain , where the resolution is finite",
    ", this discontinuity will appear generically in finite time .",
    "as such , an approximation of the event horizon will appear numerically as the formation of a jump discontinuity in the eikonal for outgoing data that is propagated into the past .",
    "this is the numerical signature of black hole event horizons in the eikonal s solutions .",
    "analysis of the continuum properties of the eikonal equation as a hamilton jacobi equation identifies three closely related approaches to tracking black hole event horizons :    * system i : the null geodesic equations @xmath49 where the integral is evaluated along the solutions of @xmath50 * system ii : the eikonal @xmath51 * system iii : the flux conservative form @xmath52",
    "@xmath53    in each of the above three systems of equations the hamiltonian is given by ( [ pde ] ) .",
    "in each of the above cases , the structure of the dynamical equations provide certain advantages .",
    "for example , in each case the symplectic structure can be employed to identify numerical loss of accuracy in a similar manner to some modern numerical schemes used in hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "further , as a flux conservative system , high resolution methods from computational fluid dynamics can be applied directly to the third system . in following sections of this article ,",
    "the second system is considered since this system of equations yields an expedient implementation that is sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "singular behavior on the eikonal is not specific to only the event horizon and instead , as described in detail by arnold and newman @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the eikonal is known to generically break down on caustic and other sets .",
    "special numerical methods are then required to handle the generic singular behavior of the eikonal ; we make use of an explicit viscosity term . in the continuum ,",
    "addition of our form of numerical viscosity at the level of the finite difference approximation corresponds to replacing the evolution of @xmath54 with evolution of the equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a small quantity which we call the viscosity and @xmath57 denotes any second order , linear derivative operator . there is a well defined sense in which the solutions @xmath32 relate to the solutions @xmath58 ; it is simply given ( when the solutions @xmath32 exist ) by the wkb transformation @xmath59 to see the explicit relationship between the solutions @xmath58 and the solutions @xmath32 note that @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 assuming that the hamiltonian is homogeneous of degree one in momentum , and making use of perturbation theory : @xmath63 substituting these results into ( [ wkb ] ) and cancelling an overall factor of @xmath64 gives at lowest , and first order : @xmath65 @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the first order linear hamiltonian obtained from perturbation theory . at zeroth order",
    ", @xmath32 then satisfies the eikonal equation , while the first order correction is the linear result of first order perturbation theory and expresses the evolution of @xmath68 .",
    "higher order results can be found similarly .",
    "again , these results hold only where solutions of @xmath32 exist ; that is , away from discontinuities or other solution singularities in @xmath32 and its derivatives .",
    "the above analysis is a slight modification of usual wkb expansion and expresses the solutions @xmath58 in terms of the solutions @xmath32 .",
    "such solutions can be inverted using the conventional method of series inversion . to invert the wkb expression , and express the solutions of the eikonal in terms of the solution of the parabolic equation , assume first that the solution of the parabolic equation ( [ wkb ] ) is given as @xmath58 ( numerically or otherwise ) .",
    "writing @xmath69 the procedure is then analogous to that of the wkb expansion : @xmath70 is constructed as an asymptotic power series with coefficients depending on @xmath58 alone .",
    "the result of such an analysis is simply : @xmath71 where the integral is evaluated along @xmath72 and @xmath58 is provided independently by ( numerical ) solution of @xmath73    one advantage of an explicit second order viscosity term is a simple procedure for reducing the error of viscosity solutions by one order of the viscosity @xmath56 .",
    "the limit @xmath74 corresponds to a continuous family of zeroth order solutions @xmath75 ; where @xmath76 and @xmath77 . note that each solution @xmath75 is obtained from an analysis similar to that following equation ( [ spsi ] ) , although obtained by neglecting the logarithm .",
    "given two viscosity solutions @xmath75 and @xmath78 it is then possible to construct a third improved viscosity solution @xmath79 that is accurate to @xmath80 .",
    "to see this , consider the combination @xmath81 @xmath79 is accurate to @xmath80 since @xmath82    to make use of these improved viscosity solutions let @xmath83 denote the resolution of the numerical mesh .",
    "any second order finite difference approximation will have then @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the continuum solution and @xmath86 denotes its finite difference approximation.[we will use a hat throughout the paper to denote the discrete approximation to a continuum object . ] similarly , @xmath87 using @xmath88 gives @xmath89",
    "of crucial interest in the binary black hole coalescence problem are the areas of sections of the black hole event horizon . to find these sections , at any given time level",
    "any of the level sets , say @xmath90 , can be extracted to obtain the surface @xmath31 , a two dimensional section of the corresponding null surface .",
    "this problem of extraction is an inverse problem , since it requires that points @xmath91 are found such that @xmath92 . to accomplish this inversion ,",
    "we find that an ordinary bisection method is sufficient for use with an ordinary second order interpolation scheme . in this method",
    "it is assumed that the surface @xmath31 can be expressed in spherical coordinates @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the surface function for a given center @xmath95 contained within the surface @xmath31 .",
    "given a choice for the center , the radial function for @xmath96 can then be approximated via the interpolation and bisection .    to establish the accuracy of our implementation , including the routines that accomplish extraction of the level sets and the accuracy of the viscosity term",
    ", we consider stationary , spinning black holes .",
    "this case is completely described by the kerr - newmann family of axisymmetric solutions of einstein s equation .",
    "it is convenient to make use of the kerr - schild form for the metric @xcite since this form is used in our binary black hole evolution code as well as in our solution of the initial value problem for setting initial data for the evolution .",
    "specifically , the metric in the kerr - schild form is @xmath97 here @xmath98 is minkowski s metric , @xmath99 is a space time scalar , and @xmath100 is an ingoing null vector with respect to both the minkowski and full metric .",
    "the kerr solution is the two parameter family of solutions such that @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 finally , the event horizon for the kerr black hole is located on the ellipsoid @xmath108 where @xmath109    in figures ( [ verrora:1 ] ) -([vsrmse:1 ] ) we show the evolution backward in time of the eikonal equation ( followed by extraction of the @xmath110 surface ) . errors can arise both in the evolution and in the extraction of the surface .",
    "figure ( [ verrora:1 ] ) shows the percent errors in the extracted areas for a nonspinning black holes with mass @xmath111 , @xmath112 in a survey over the viscosity parameter .",
    "figure ( [ vrmse:1 ] ) shows a similar study but for the l2 norm of the truncation error in the function @xmath113 .",
    "note that the function @xmath113 is defined for every point of the horizon in the continuum @xmath114 . in the computational domain @xmath113 then takes a discrete form @xmath115 , where the integers @xmath116 span the numerical mesh .",
    "the truncation error @xmath117 is then @xmath118 where is it understood that both @xmath113 and @xmath119 are evaluated at the same point .",
    "bith figures([verrora:1 ] ) and ( [ vrmse:1])show that viscosity parameter @xmath120 adequately captures the horizon location . while not perfect , it will suffice for the short term horizon tracking reported here .",
    "however these results also suggest that in vanishing viscosity the percentage error in the calculated area is reduced toward a bias .",
    "this bias is partly associated to the finite resolution of the computational mesh and partly to accuracy of the extraction routine .",
    "these figures were generated using a three dimensional computational domain of @xmath121 points with @xmath122 .",
    "the outer boundaries are located at @xmath123 $ ] in the @xmath124 directions .",
    "the resolution of the finite difference mesh for these results is then @xmath125 .",
    "also , a courant - friedrichs - lewy factor of @xmath126 with an iterated crank nicholson scheme @xcite was used as the finite difference approximation of the evolution of the eikonal equation ( [ pde ] ) .",
    "neumann boundary conditions @xmath127 on the outer boundary are found to be generically sufficient conditions for stability of the method .",
    "the philosophy here is that the primary interest is deep within the bulk of the computational domain where the event horizon of the black hole is located .",
    "the outer boundary is then treated only to the degree that the evolution of the interior region remains stable .",
    "further , the interior of the black hole is excised from the computational domain in a sphere of radius @xmath128 , where @xmath129 denotes the radius of the kerr - newman ring curvature singularity .",
    "finally , the discrete surface @xmath130 was constructed using @xmath131 points with @xmath132 . at such a resolution of the extracted surface any errors in the area must be attributed to all of : the viscosity parameter , the extraction routine , and the resolution of the underlying three dimensional grid .",
    "figures ( [ vserrora:1 ] ) and ( [ vsrmse:1 ] ) show the percent errors in the extracted areas as well as the l2 norm of the truncation error in the function @xmath113 in a survey over the angular momentum parameter @xmath133 . here",
    "the viscosity is @xmath134 .",
    "these figures both show the evolution from a single null sphere that is completely exterior to the horizon and propagated into the past .",
    "since the event horizon of a spinning black hole is elliptical in its geometry , the spherical data we have chosen for @xmath135 corresponds to a percent error in the area and @xmath113 that varies with the spin parameter @xmath136 at @xmath135 , explaining why the curves do not intersect at @xmath135 .",
    "( where appropriate we append a @xmath137 to @xmath8 , thus : @xmath138 , indicating evolution into the past ; we also sometimes use @xmath139 to emphasize that we mean the forward evolving , usual , time @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath135 corresponds to the late time at which we begin to integrate into the past . )",
    "however , the errors should converge to a constant , which is evident in each of the curves with @xmath140 in figures ( [ vserrora:1 ] ) and ( [ vsrmse:1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath141 the curve does not converge , and we expect that different choice of initial data _ will _ exhibit convergence .",
    "according to these results , the viscosity level set method does indeed accurately and robustly detect the distorted outermost event horizons of spinning black holes at least when @xmath140 .",
    "note that we study both the accuracy of @xmath113 and the accuracy of the calculated areas since the calculations seperately and together establish the accuracy of our area calculation and of our detection of the event horizon .",
    "analysis of the event horizon for the binary black hole coalescence problem in the case of head on collision has been considered in detail in @xcite . the problem of the event horizon for asymmetric , that is off axis",
    ", collision has only been considered analytically @xcite and prior to this work no results for numerically generated sources have been analyzed . numerical evolution and analysis of an asymmetric binary black hole system",
    "was studied in @xcite , but at that time the question of the event horizon was not considered .    in this section the results of the previous sections are applied to the first completely numerical analysis of the event horizon for the case of asymmetric collision .    to begin , consider two black holes of mass @xmath142 with aligned spins in the positive @xmath143 direction of @xmath144 .",
    "the computational domain is a grid of @xmath121 points with @xmath122 .",
    "the outer boundary is located at @xmath145 and the holes are initially positioned at @xmath146 , and @xmath147 . this computational domain is identical to the mesh used in the previous section to analyze the percent error in area calculations of surfaces extracted from the level set method . the percent error in the calculation of the area of sections of the horizon",
    "should have a magnitude of about @xmath148 .",
    "further , as an order of magnitude estimate , in a flat spatial geometry ; e.g. , in a newtonian spacetime , the initial separation @xmath149 of the black hole centers would be @xmath150 . this would seem to be an ample initial separation to guarantee that the initial data corresponds to two distinct black holes .",
    "however , in the case that the holes are nonspinning , each will have a spherical event horizon of radius @xmath151 . assuming only marginal distortion of the nonspinning event horizons due to spin effects , which is an approximation that is justified by the properties of spin @xmath152 black holes , the nearest separation between the two sections of the black hole event horizon is then approximately @xmath153 .",
    "again , this approximation assumes a flat underlying geometry ; and so can be considered only as an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "these initial data then appear to correspond to a separation of approximately two nonspinning black hole diameters between the surfaces of section of the black holes .    the holes are boosted along the @xmath154 direction with speeds of @xmath155 .",
    "this boost lengthens the nearest separation @xmath156 of the holes due to lorentz contraction of the horizons.[in this coordinate system the horizons undergo contraction in the direction of motion . for a single hole ,",
    "the area of the horizon does not change under this boost . ] the nearest coordinate separation @xmath156 between the holes is then expected to lie in the range @xmath157 .",
    "the numerical evolution of this collision process is carried out for approximately @xmath158 of run time with a courant factor of @xmath159 .",
    "the code is the texas black hole evolution code , a derivative of the agave code @xcite .",
    "apparent horizon finders @xcite locate two distinct apparent horizons of area @xmath160 for the initial data and continue to do so until @xmath161 , when only a single apparent horizon of area @xmath162 can be located .",
    "this single apparent horizon persists until approximately @xmath158 , beyond which instability effects , stemming from the outer boundary and the excision boundary , swamp the solution .",
    "while the run length of this asymmetric collision data is relatively small in units of the black hole masses , the problem of detecting the associated black hole event horizon , or horizons , is not a small computational problem .",
    "for example , to analyze this data requires analysis of the lapse @xmath41 , the shift vector @xmath42 , and the three metric @xmath10 . by symmetry of the metric , @xmath163",
    ", there are only 6 independent components .",
    "tracking the event horizon of the associated data then requires analysis of 10 grid functions , where each grid function consists of @xmath164 of data .",
    "that is , tracking the associated event horizon requires analysis of approximately @xmath165 of data .    a more serious difficulty associated to this data set is the relaxation time , @xmath166 , that is typically required for outgoing data to converge onto the event horizon when followed into the past .",
    "assuming that the collision time is ( as suggested by the apparent horizon solvers ) near @xmath167 , perturbation theory implies that the resulting horizon should undergo quasi normal ringing for another @xmath168 from that time .",
    "that is , at the time level @xmath169 , where the event horizon tracker will begin tracking into the past , it is expected that the event horizon remains highly distorted and far from its stationary regime .",
    "the problem is to determine good data for the eikonal at the time level @xmath169 , which can then be propagated into the past .",
    "in contrast , in analysis of the event horizon for the case of head on collision , researchers made use of approximately @xmath170 of data @xcite , and assumed that the final state at @xmath171 was a stationary or quasi stationary black hole .",
    "in such a circumstance using spherically symmetric data at @xmath171 for an event horizon tracking method should prove sufficient .",
    "the difficulty with a data set only of length @xmath169 is that using spherically symmetric data for the eikonal at the time level @xmath169 does not accurately approximate sections of the event horizon at that time .    to accommodate data of this @xmath158 length and to generate sufficient data for the eikonal at the time level @xmath169 , a method for finding a candidate section of the event horizon at @xmath172",
    "is proposed here and applied to the problem .",
    "this method makes use of the analytic properties of apparent and event horizons .    to motivate the method ,",
    "note that if the event horizon were stationary at @xmath169 then the expansion of the surface would be vanishing there : @xmath173 in such a circumstance the apparent horizon could be used as initial data for the eikonal , which could then be propagated into the past .",
    "however , according to the second law of black hole mechanics , in the case that the horizon is nonstationary , which is the situation expected for this asymmetric problem , at @xmath169 the horizon will satisfy @xmath174 in the forward time direction . in the backwards time direction",
    "these dynamics correspond to @xmath175 at @xmath169 . as such",
    ", the taylor series of any compact null surface , including the critical surface of the event horizon , is at least of the form @xmath176 and probably can not be truncated to below @xmath177 the apparent horizon is then a poor estimate for the the event horizon at @xmath169 . the objective is to use this behavior ( [ adot ] ) in combination with the property that outgoing null data followed into the past converges to the event horizon .",
    "the hope is to establish a better approximation for the structure of the section of the event horizon at @xmath169 , which can then be used in an event horizon tracking method .    to proceed , consider three compact null surfaces of outgoing data : one completely interior to the horizon @xmath178 , one completely exterior to the horizon @xmath179 , and one that is a surface of section of the event horizon @xmath180 .",
    "let @xmath181 denote propagation into the past",
    ". by the property that outgoing data numerically converges to the horizon when propagated into the past , @xmath182 .",
    "thus in most cases , if the surface @xmath183 is pulled back to the time level @xmath138 and compared to the surface @xmath184 it will be completely exterior to @xmath184 . similarly , if the surface @xmath185 is pulled back to the time level @xmath138 it will be completely interior to the surface @xmath186 .",
    "that is , by iteratively pulling the surfaces back to a single time level , spherically symmetric data will approach the numerical event horizon .",
    "exceptions to this general behavior stem from the presence of caustics in the spacetime , where null surfaces intersect , and in neighborhoods of the event horizon .",
    "in particular , as discussed above , the horizon of this asymmetric collision data is expected to satisfy @xmath187 .",

    "this approach is similar to treating the event horizon as if it were an apparent horizon , although modified to account for this nonstationary regime .",

    "as shown in figure ( [ m:4 ] ) the viscosity solutions of the eikonal equation do continuously monitor a change in topology . in the case of asymmetric binary black hole coalescence",
    "it is conjectured that the level set @xmath31 , which corresponds to a section of the event horizon , must take a higher genus topology at merger . to investigate this possibility , figure ( [ m:10 ] )",

    "it is apparent that the throat function of the topological transition is elliptical in geometry .",
    "studies indicate that this elliptical throat function persists for all null surfaces ( i.e. those slightly inside or slightly outside our candidate event horizon ) undergoing the topological transition .",
    "further , for all of our computed transitions of the null surfaces , no higher genus topology is exhibited ; instead , the elliptical geometry of the throat persists to the transition .",
    "these results suggest that if there is a non trivial topology in the sections of the event horizon as a consequence of the asymmetry of the merger , then that topology change is bounded to occur when the minor axis of the ellipse is within one of our computational zones , or @xmath231 .",
    "figure ( [ n:1 ] ) shows an area versus time plot for this asymmetric collision .",
    "the curve with the lowest area is the result of a viscosity solution with @xmath232 .",
    "the curve with the second lowest area is the result of a viscosity solution with @xmath134 , while the topmost curve is an improved viscosity solution composed of the two higher viscosity solutions .",
    "according to these results it is immediately apparent that the viscosity solutions of higher viscosity show a merger time that is later in @xmath139 ( and therefore prior in @xmath138 ) then the merger time found with solutions constructed in the limit of vanishing viscosity .",
    "these results then indicate that the error ( or bias ) in the merger time of the viscosity solutions is directly related to the magnitude of the viscosity .",
    "more precisely , for the continuum merger time of @xmath233 and an approximate merger time of @xmath234 , constructed using a viscosity solution of viscosity parameter @xmath56 , the function @xmath235 is increasing in @xmath56 .",
    "( here all surface areas are calculated with @xmath131 points where @xmath236 . )",
    "figure ( [ n:2 ] ) shows several area versus time curves for initial data of the form @xmath237 where the data @xmath221 is that obtained using the method of section vii . from top to bottom , the curves show areas for @xmath238 and with a viscosity parameter of @xmath210 .",
    "recall that studies of the apparent horizons found that the true event horizon is contained in the domain @xmath239 .",
    "this survey over @xmath240 is conducted in search for the convergence signature associated to event horizons . due to the time scale of this data ,",
    "the time scale of the dynamics , and the relaxation time scale of the event horizon tracking method , the signature is not clearly apparent .",
    "however , this study of the area curves does show convergence of the areas , which is expected for null data approaching the horizon when propagated into the past .",
    "the curve with @xmath241 shows behavior suggestive of an event horizon since the @xmath242 curves all approach that of @xmath243 .",
    "the @xmath243 curve is therefore considered the best candidate for the numerical event horizon of this study .",
    "note that the sections of this event horizon completely contain the correct apparent horizons for all @xmath244 .",
    "further , these @xmath241 data show a bifurcation time at @xmath245 , which corresponds to a merger time of about @xmath246 . this bifurcation time",
    "is detected by an algorithm that searches for any points @xmath247 of the surface such that @xmath248 . in the circumstance",
    "that a point is found such that @xmath249 , the bifurcation is expected to occur in a few more @xmath250 in the @xmath138 direction .",
    "a few time levels prior to this bifurcation time in @xmath138 ( i.e. just after the bifurcation in @xmath8 ) , the single merged horizon component has an area ( the area of the level set ) computed to be @xmath251 . based on analysis of area computations for exact solutions ( figure([vserrora:1 ] ) , we anticipate an error in the horizon area of several percent .",
    "we conservatively assign an @xmath252 error to the areas . just prior",
    "( in @xmath8 ) to merger the area of each black hole is then @xmath253 .",
    "these individual areas correspond to a schwarzschild mass of about @xmath254 .",
    "this result is a substantially larger mass for each hole then determined by the apparent horizon finders at the time level @xmath255 .",
    "interestingly , studies have found that apparent horizons separated by about @xmath158 show an increase in their mass due to the effects of binding energy@xcite .",
    "individual masses of about @xmath256 are then only a slight departure from studies that account for the binding energy of the holes .",
    "further , at the time of merger the holes have undergone @xmath257 of evolution , during which the holes could accrete any surrounding gravitational radiation present in the initial data .",
    "the presence of such radiation would lead to larger masses then those found using apparent horizon finders at @xmath255 .",
    "however , it is important to note that due to the viscosity in the solution the result @xmath256 can only properly be considered as a lower bound on the calculated masses .",
    "the most significant contribution to any error in this result must stem from the relatively small time scale of this asymmetric collision data and coupling of that time scale to the @xmath258folding time scale of this event horizon detection method .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated a relatively simple yet robust and ( most importantly ) generic solution to the problem of numerically tracking black hole event horizons .",
    "an implementation of our method made use of an explicit second order diffusion term to regulate the solution singularities associated to caustics . as demonstrated by analysis of analytic sources , this term does introduce numerical error although we demonstrate our control over these effects and the resulting accuracy .",
    "but , the use of a second order diffusion term is not required by our method per se ; and a variety of other approaches can be employed .",
    "examples of other methods for controlling breakdown of the numerical solution include those classes of high resolution shock capturing numerical schemes that are used extensively in computational fluid dynamics for hyperbolic problems similar to the eikonal equation .",
    "the application of our new method for event horizon tracking method considered the asymmetric binary black hole coalescence problem , including a detailed analysis of areas of the surfaces of sections , the collision time , associated apparent horizons , and the topology of the horizon . due to the relatively short time scale of the collision data ,",
    "our method was unable to demonstrate the signature of the black hole event horizon .",
    "we believe that this problem is due to the data itself and not due to our method .",
    "we anticipate much more accurate and convincing results as more accurate computational simulations of black hole interactions become available ."
