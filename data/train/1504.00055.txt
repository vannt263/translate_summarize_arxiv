    "in 1965 , e. calabi stated in @xcite the following conjecture , ( also known as the first calabi s conjecture \" ) : _ prove that a complete minimal hypersurface in @xmath5 must be unbounded_. this conjecture turned to be false when we consider _ immersed _ hypersurfaces : in the paper @xcite , n. nadirashvili constructed a complete immersion of a minimal disk into the unit ball in @xmath6 .",
    "nadirashvili s complete immersion is not proper , so it is natural to wonder about the rle of properness in relation with the first calabi s conjecture .",
    "in fact , in the paper @xcite , t. h. colding and w. p. minicozzi studied the following question ( also known as the calabi - yau conjecture ) : _ prove that every complete embedded minimal surface in @xmath6 is proper . _    in @xcite the authors proved that a complete embedded minimal disk in @xmath6 must be proper , so the first calabi s conjecture is true for embedded minimal disks .",
    "moreover they proved that a complete embedded minimal surface with finite topology , ( namely , homeomorphic to a compact @xmath3-dimensional manifold , from which it has been removed a finite number of points , which corresponds to the number of _ ends _ of the surface ) , is properly immersed in @xmath6 .    on the other hand ,",
    "w. h. meeks and h. rosenberg proved in the paper @xcite that a complete embedded minimal surface with positive injectivity radius in @xmath6 must be proper .",
    "this result includes coldings - minicozzi result because they proved too in this paper that every complete embedded minimal surface with finite topology in @xmath6 has positive injectivity radius .",
    "we shall extract the intrinsic aspects of this proof ( see lemma [ meeksrosenberg ] ) to show our theorem [ mainth1 ] .",
    "more recently , calabi - yau s conjecture has been explored in broader contexts , namely , w. h. meeks , j. perez and a. ros have proved , ( see @xcite ) , that calabi - yau conjecture is true when we consider embedded minimal surfaces with finite genus and countable number of ends in @xmath6 . on the other hand , b. coskunuzer , w. h. meeks and g. tinaglia proved that calabi - yau conjecture is not true in @xmath7",
    ": there exists a non properly embedded minimal plane ( genus zero , one end ) in @xmath7 , ( see @xcite ) . in this way ,",
    "m. rodriguez and g. tinaglia have constructed a family of non - proper complete minimal disks with finite total curvature in the quotient of @xmath8 by the discrete group of isometries generated by vertical translations and screw motions , which are embedded in @xmath8 , ( see the paper @xcite ) .",
    "taking as a starting point all these results , several questions arises in a natural way , e.g. , what happens when we consider non minimal surfaces ( or submanifolds ) immersed in a more general ambient space ? . or , could the embeddedness of the immersion be replaced by another hypothesis related with the volume or the metric ? .",
    "summarizing : what can be said about geometric conditions describing the properness of an immersion in a broader context ?",
    "looking for these geometric conditions and given an isometric immersion @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are complete riemannian manifolds , a quite natural assumption to be considered is following @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the geodesic @xmath14-ball in the ambient manifold @xmath15 .",
    "the domains @xmath16 are known as the _ extrinsic _ @xmath14-balls .",
    "in fact , when the ambient manifold is complete , inequality ( [ hypovol ] ) is a necessary condition for properness .",
    "however , it is not a sufficient condition : consider e. g. a negatively curved and non - compact surface with finite volume which can be immersed ( via nash immersion theorem ) in a metric ball in @xmath17 for large @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand there are immediate examples of proper non - embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath6 , such as enneper s surface or proper minimal surfaces with infinite topology , such the @xmath18-periodic scherk s surface which in its turn satisfies inequality ( [ hypovol ] ) .",
    "we can find in the very recent literature , ( see remark 4 in @xcite ) , the proof that inequality ( [ hypovol ] ) satisfied by the extrinsic balls @xmath19 of a minimal immersion @xmath20 in a cartan - hadamard manifold @xmath11 with sectional curvatures bounded from above @xmath21 implies the properness of @xmath10 .",
    "an older reference of the same result , but for minimal surfaces in @xmath6 with finite topology can be found in theorem 3 in @xcite .    concerning the techniques used , the proof in @xcite is based in the intrinsic monotonicity property satisfied by the ( intrinsic ) volume growth @xmath22 of such immersions . here",

    ", we can find also in lemma 4 in @xcite an extrinsic approach to the use of the monotonicity formula of the extrinsic volume growth @xmath26 to prove that a minimal hypersurface @xmath27 is proper when the extrinsic volume growth is finite , ( a more restrictive hypothesis than our condition ( [ hypovol ] ) ) .",
    "this approach inspires the interplay between the intrinsic and the extrinsic distances used in @xcite to prove the properness of a minimal immersion in a cartan - hadamard manifold as well as our own way to prove theorem [ mainth0 ] , where we obtain a characterization of properness for non - minimal immersions in a broader family of ambient riemannian manifolds , namely , the riemannian manifolds with _ bounded geometry_.    recall that a complete and non - compact riemannian manifold @xmath15 is a manifold with _ bounded geometry _ if its sectional curvatures @xmath28 are bounded from above , @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 ) , and its injectivity radius @xmath31 is positive @xmath32 . we must remark that cartan - hadamard manifolds are simply connected riemannian manifolds with bounded geometry , being @xmath33 and @xmath34 in this case .    in fact , we have used a comparison for the volume of geodesic balls in a submanifold with controlled @xmath1 norm of its mean curvature immersed in such ambient manifolds , stablished by m.p .",
    "cavalcante , h. mirandola and f. vitorio in @xcite as a part of the proof of their theorem b. we follow a similar vein of reasoning that these authors , but for different purposes : while they prove that the volume of the ends of the submanifold is infinite , we characterize the properness of the immersion ( see remarks [ infinite1 ] and [ infinite2 ] where we try to relate both facts ) .    in this regard , we have obtained the following theorem for submanifolds with bounded @xmath1-norm of their mean curvature vector , immersed in a riemannian manifold with bounded geometry .",
