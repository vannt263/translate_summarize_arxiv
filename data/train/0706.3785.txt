    "simple models of evolution may sometimes lead to complicated and unexpected behavior , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite . we consider the following elementary problem .",
    "let us choose a finite set of @xmath0 points @xmath1  distributed arbitrarily ( in particular randomly ) on the plane .",
    "let us further label these points in a unique but otherwise quite arbitrary way:@xmath2of course , given any set one has @xmath3 different ways of labelling its elements .",
    "we can further treat these points as two - dimensional sequence of vectors attached to the origin of the cartesian coordinates .",
    "define next the following `` cyclic '' sequence of vector differences and denote them @xmath4:@xmath5it represents a sequence of @xmath6 new vectors which , after appropriate shifting , may also be attached to the origin of coordinates .",
    "we can consider these points as the next phase of some discrete time evolution and repeat the process iteratively many times .",
    "note that this process is strictly deterministic , that is , once chosen the initial points and their labelling , the rest of the discrete evolution is fully determined regardless of how many steps has been performed .",
    "the only chaotic element in this process is included in the initial distribution , unless this distribution is deliberately chosen as regular .",
    "each transition @xmath7 in this discrete evolution can be written using more suggestive matrix notation as:@xmath8for the @xmath9 coordinate and similarly for the @xmath10 coordinate , where @xmath11 consequently , starting from the initial configuration , after @xmath12 evolution steps , we get:@xmath13where the power is understood as matrix power , of course .",
    "( matrix which appears in ( [ matrix ] ) and ( [ matrixn ] ) is a special case of so - called circulant matrix , cf .",
    "@xcite , for pedagogical review see gray . )",
    "using different , perhaps less evocative notation , this algorithm can also be written in coordinate representation as:@xmath14equations ( [ forwardn ] ) coincide with with the higher order differences @xcite .    in the final section complete analytical solution to this problem",
    "will be given using discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this problem may easily be investigated numerically . the experiments starting from many different random initial distributions give surprising and decidedly counter - intuitive results .",
    "naively , one would expect that this algorithm , when starting from purely random distributions , would just produce more random distributions .",
    "however , it turns out that the final configuration depends simply on whether @xmath6 is even or odd . in case of @xmath6 even , after roughly @xmath6 steps of discrete evolution , we get exactly two different separate loops of points .",
    "one of these loops contains points with odd labels whereas the other contains points with even labels . on the other hand , in case of @xmath6 odd we get a single loop of points .",
    "all configurations are asymptotically point symmetrical with respect to the origin .",
    "( in other words , the center of mass of the system is in the center of coordinates . )",
    "these results may be qualitatively understood .",
    "the crucial thing here is that the number of points @xmath6  is finite and they follow a cyclical pattern . since the @xmath12-th order forward derivatives ( [ forwardn ] ) involve @xmath15 terms , when @xmath12 exceeds  @xmath6 some numbers @xmath16 appear more than once .",
    "when @xmath17 then each @xmath16 appears many times in a linear yet complicated combination .",
    "all figures below were made using _ mathematica _ ( cf .",
    "we also made some animated gifs which illustrate this phenomenon and are available from the authors .",
    "the statement of the problem was given by the first author .",
    "he also performed the numerical experiments described above . the complete analytical solution which we shall present below was given by the second author .",
    "we may consider the coordinates separately .",
    "the calculations below concern the @xmath9 coordinate but may be applied to @xmath10 ( as well as to other possible coordinates in higher dimensions ) .",
    "let us denote initial values of coordinates by @xmath18recall that the discrete time evolution is described by the equations:@xmath19the evolution is linear , therefore it may be diagonalized using discrete fourier transform @xmath20where @xmath21 .",
    "fourier transform of the eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) reads @xmath22the general formula is @xmath23the inverse fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ gf ] ) is @xmath24from this point we will write equations for two coordinates .    in the case of odd @xmath6 ,",
    "absolute value of @xmath25 reaches maximum of @xmath26 for @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "hence for large @xmath12 we have the following approximation @xmath29@xmath30where @xmath31 are numerical coefficients : @xmath32we note that the following relations hold@xmath33we have in this case@xmath34where@xmath35hence for large @xmath12 and @xmath36 , the points @xmath37 lie on an ellipse @xmath38    in the case of even @xmath6 , absolute value of @xmath25 reaches maximum value equal @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 / hence for large @xmath12 we have an approximate relation @xmath42where @xmath43    more detailed investigations , when higher eingenvalue is taken into account , give the following asymptotics:@xmath44 , \\qquad \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi \\left ( l+\\frac{t}{2}\\right ) } { n}\\]]where @xmath45  and @xmath46 are defined similarly to ( [ abcd ] ) with @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 .",
    "the process presented in this paper may easily be generalized to more spatial dimensions .",
    "the method described in the previous section applies also in this case . just as in the 2d case",
    "the final configuration depends solely on whether @xmath6 is odd or even ( cf . fig .",
    "4 ) .    let us finally note that this example of discrete time evolution leading from random to ordered distribution complies with several informal requirements formulated by some distinguished mathematicians when they spoke about aesthetics or even beauty of their discipline .",
    "namely , given result should be easily stated , yet counter - intuitive , deeply non - obvious , surprising .",
    "it should have rigorous and elegant proof .",
