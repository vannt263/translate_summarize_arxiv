    "sen s conjectures on tachyon condensation @xcite have contributed immensely to the development of study of non - perturbative features in string theories .",
    "the conjectures are basically composed of three parts : ( a ) the potential height of the tachyon potential exactly cancels the tension of the original unstable d - brane . ( b ) at the stable true vacuum , the original d - brane disappears and closed string theory is realized .",
    "( c ) the kink - type tachyon condensations correspond to lower dimensional d - branes and organize `` descent relations '' between stable and unstable d - branes ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "these conjectures have been examined from various viewpoints in string / m theory , such as boundary string field theories ( bsft ) @xcite , cubic / vacuum string field theory ( c / vsft ) , k - theory , and non - commutative solitons .",
    "the conjecture ( a ) was verified @xcite in the bsft , while the conjecture ( b ) has been challenged by the c / vsft approach .",
    "the conjecture ( c ) has been supported from the success of the k - theory , and the non - commutative solitons gave a partial evidence also for ( c ) .",
    "[ fig - dis ]    figure 1 : the descent relations for the tachyon condensations .",
    "we omit the horizontal arrows which relate type iia with type iib , since they only denote the truncation of the fields .",
    "all of the above conjectures are involved with non - perturbative phenomena in string / m theory , thus non - perturbative analyses , such as string field theories treating all the massive modes at once , are necessary .",
    "however , we understand that the history of the development of string theory in these six years tells us that the low energy effective theory approach is powerful and promising .",
    "this approach is closely related to the bsft in which one turns on only certain profiles of string excitation modes . since the study of ( b ) requires @xmath3 channel duality , this needs all the massive modes of open string excitation .",
    "however , the conjecture ( c ) is in our reach even by the low energy effective field theory approach , if we appropriately incorporate some of the bsft results on the exact tachyon potentials .",
    "the field theory models proposed by j.  minahan and b.  zwiebach ( we call mz models ) @xcite gave a verification of a part of the descent relations ( the arrow ( 3 ) in fig .  1 and the descent relations among bosonic branes ) , at the level of low energy effective field theories ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the mz models include a tachyon field , and were proposed as a toy model of the tachyon condensation .",
    "they have kink solutions corresponding to co - dimension one bps d - branes , and the fluctuations around the solutions are exactly solvable .",
    "the resultant fluctuation spectra have equal mass - squared spacing , which resembles to the spectra of the bps d - brane .",
    "in fact , it turned out @xcite that the mz model is actually a two - derivative truncation of the bsft action of a non - bps d - brane in type ii string theories .",
    "this consistency provided a further support to the verification by the mz model .    in this paper , we investigate the descent relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fig .  1 ,",
    "by use of low energy effective field theories .",
    "both arrows have their starting point at the d@xmath0 system , therefore we use effective actions for the d@xmath0 which are basically derivative truncation of the bsft results @xcite .",
    "the tachyon condensation ( 1 ) is the process of creating a co - dimension one defect , therefore we study a kink solution in the d@xmath0 effective action .",
    "the kink represents the non - bps d(@xmath4)-brane . performing the fluctuation analysis around this kink",
    ", we obtain an effective action describing the kink , and we show that it coincides with the mz model action which was the starting point of the arrow ( 3 ) in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the process ( 2 ) is the creation of a co - dimension two defect , a vortex , which represents a bps d(@xmath5)-brane .",
    "although derrick s theorem prevents us from obtaining naive co - dimension two solution , we consider higher derivative terms and obtain a nonsingular vortex solution .",
    "we perform the fluctuation spectra and obtain the massless spectra of the bps brane , and show that those modes obey dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action which is a correct low energy effective action of the bps brane .",
    "one should note that the arrow ( 2 ) is different from the naive successive analyses ( 1 ) + ( 3 ) , since the classical solution in ( 3 ) is not exactly marginal in ( 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we can show the universality that our results do not depend on the particular form of the action at the starting point . requiring the properties followed from the bsft",
    ", we write a rather general action and reproduce most of the results above under a few assumptions .",
    "we believe that our analysis provides a strong evidence for sen s conjecture at the effective theory level .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .  2 , after reviewing the minahan - zwiebach model",
    ", we show the descent relation from d9@xmath69 system to the non - bps d8-brane in type iib string theory concerning the tachyon condensation ( 1 ) by examining the fluctuations around the kink solution of the d9@xmath69 effective action . in sec .  3 , we show the descent relation ( 2 ) which is the tachyon condensation from the d9@xmath69 system to the bps d7-brane . the universality in each case is shown in the respective sections .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussions in sec .",
    "the appendix is concerning the construction of bound states of d - branes in tachyon condensation .",
    "in this section , we derive the minahan - zwiebach ( mz ) model ( which is a low - energy effective description of a non - bps d8-brane ) from a tachyon kink solution in a d9@xmath79 system .",
    "this verifies a part of sen s descent relation , the arrow ( 1 ) in fig .  1 , at the level of effective field theories .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath8 for the rest of this paper , and generalization to the other dimensions is straightforward .",
    "the minahan - zwiebach models @xcite are low energy effective models which embody the tachyon dynamics for unstable d - branes in ( super)string theories .",
    "although the models were first proposed as a toy model capturing desirable properties of string theories , it turned out @xcite that one of the models is a derivative truncation of the bsft action of the non - bps branes .    since we shall use some of the techniques developed by minahan and zwiebach , in this subsection we review their methods .",
    "the `` superstring '' model which is related to the bsft is described by the action @xmath9 this action is the two - derivative truncation of the tachyon action of the bsft . here",
    "@xmath10 is the tension of the non - bps d8-brane , and the dimensionality of the numerical parameter @xmath11 is retained , we have @xmath12 . ] by @xmath13 .",
    "the equation of motion is solved by a linear tachyon profile @xmath14 which interpolates two vacua of the theory , @xmath15 .",
    "the center of the kink sits at @xmath16 , which can be viewed from the fact that the perturbative unstable vacuum is at @xmath17 .",
    "let us consider the fluctuation @xmath18 around the kink solution , @xmath19 substituting this into the action ( [ mzaction ] ) , we have @xmath20 after a partial integration and the field redefinition @xmath21 we obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 runs over all the directions except for @xmath24 which is the direction transverse to the brane . from the above expression ,",
    "the @xmath24 dependence of the fluctuation @xmath25 obeys a schrdinger equation of a harmonic oscillator , thus the mass squared for the fluctuation is equally spaced and specified by an integer @xmath26 , @xmath27 there is no tachyonic fluctuation , the mass tower starts from a massless state and has the equal spacing .",
    "this result is consistent with the identification of this kink as a bps d7-brane .",
    "furthermore , the mass squared of the original tachyon field is @xmath28 , therefore the spacing of mass levels is twice the value of @xmath29 , as is also consistent with string theory .",
    "if we include a gauge field in the original model , then we can get even the gauge modes on the resultant kink bps d7-brane .",
    "observation in the bsft tells us that the coupling between the gauge field and the tachyon potential on the non - bps d8-brane is provided through the born - infeld action as @xcite @xmath30 a sigma - model analysis shows that the parameter @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "we are working in the approximation of the two - derivative truncation , @xmath33 the classical solution for the action is @xmath14 , @xmath34 .",
    "the gauge fluctuation around this solution is subject to the following second order action @xmath35 where we have chosen the axial gauge condition @xmath36 .",
    "after the field redefinition @xmath37 , the action ( [ acga ] ) is rewritten as @xmath38 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the mass spectrum of the gauge fluctuation starts from massless gauge modes and is equally spaced , @xmath39 this result is also consistent with the expectation from the spectra on the bps d7-brane .",
    "the minahan - zwiebach `` superstring '' model provides a suitable example realizing various aspects of the tachyon condensation on non - bps branes , in particular a part of the descent relations .",
    "the background consistency with the bsft ensures this success , and we employ this philosophy to check the other part of the descent relations in the rest of this paper .",
    "the other important part in sen s descent relations is the relation between the d9@xmath40 and a non - bps d8-brane .",
    "the latter is conjectured to be a kink solution of the former . in order to show this conjecture at the effective theory level , first we follow the procedures of the analysis reviewed in the previous subsection .",
    "the effective action of the d9@xmath40 system in the two derivative truncation is written as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a complex tachyon charged under the gauge field @xmath43 , @xmath44 the fields @xmath45 are the linear combinations of the gauge fields on the brane and the antibrane , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are dimensionful numerical constant which can be determined by the bsft analysis , string sigma model calculation , or string scattering amplitude . and @xmath48 , as mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "note that the value of @xmath11 depends on the renormalization scheme in the bsft and the sigma model approach @xcite . ]",
    "the equations of motion for this action are @xmath49 -d_\\mu d_\\mu { \\bar{t}}=0 , \\\\ & & { \\partial}_{\\nu}(e^{-|t|^2/a } f_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}^{(+)})=0 , \\\\ & & ie^{-|t|^2/a}(td_{\\mu}{\\bar{t}}- { \\bar{t}}d_{\\mu}t ) + b{\\partial}_{\\nu}(e^{-|t|^2/a } f_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}^{(-)})=0 . \\label{third}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that putting @xmath50 makes the action and equations of motion reduce to those of the mz model .",
    "in particular , the third equation ( [ third ] ) which came from the differentiation with respect to @xmath51 is trivially satisfied by this condition .",
    "therefore , the kink solution of the mz model is inherited to our situation .",
    "the desired solution is @xmath52    let us consider the fluctuation around this kink solution . as is obvious , the fluctuation spectra for the fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 are precisely the same as in the previous subsection ,",
    "thus we obtain @xmath55 here we denote the fluctuation of @xmath53 as @xmath56 .",
    "the lowest modes of these fluctuations are zero modes , and especially the @xmath56 zero mode corresponds to the scalar field on the non - bps d8-brane , representing the transverse displacement of the brane .",
    "this must have appeared by the nambu - goldstone theorem , since the translational invariance along @xmath57 direction is broken by the kink solution .",
    "another notable point about the zero modes is the @xmath57 dependence . since we solved the harmonic oscillator problem for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the ground state s wave functions are gaussian : @xmath60 } =   e^{-\\frac{x_9 ^ 2}{a}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , turning back to the field redefinition ( [ redeft ] )",
    ", we can show that the zero modes of @xmath61 are independent of @xmath57 .",
    "this kind of the property of the lowest fluctuation was observed first in the bosonic d - brane system @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation analysis for the other fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be performed in the same manner .",
    "first , we consider the fluctuation of @xmath62 around the classical solution which is written as @xmath64 substituting this into the action ( [ 98-ac ] ) and picking up the second order terms , we obtain @xmath65 after the same redefinition @xmath66 , the fluctuation action is written as @xmath67 therefore the series of the mass squared begins with the negative mass squared , which is expected to exist as a tachyonic mode of the non - bps d8-brane , @xmath68 the mass squared spacing is the same as that of @xmath56 fluctuations . again",
    ", the lowest mode is independent of @xmath57 .",
    "since there should be a single massless gauge field on the resultant non - bps d8-brane , the fluctuation of another gauge field @xmath43 must be massive .",
    "we shall see this below .",
    "the fluctuation we consider here is @xmath69 following the same procedures with the field redefinition @xmath70 we have @xmath71 { \\hat{a}}_{{{\\hat{\\mu}}}}^{(- ) } \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath72 run over @xmath73 , and the gauge fixing condition @xmath74 has been used .",
    "the mass squared is given as @xmath75 the lowest mode of these fluctuations is massive , as expected .",
    "it does not appear in the low energy effective theory of the kink .",
    "we have seen that @xmath76 still has a massless mode while @xmath51 becomes massive .",
    "one of the physical explanation is as follows .",
    "the tachyon field couples only to @xmath51 , thus if the tachyon condenses , the gauge field @xmath51 is higgsed and becomes massive .",
    "vanishes at @xmath77 .",
    "this is against our expectation and too naive , thus we have needed the precise fluctuation analysis ( [ fluctuationa- ] ) . ] on the other hand , @xmath78 is neutral under @xmath76 , thus @xmath76 stays massless after the tachyon condensation .",
    "one can see this in another way .",
    "the gauge field @xmath76 is responsible for the lower - dimensional d - brane charges , as seen in app .",
    "a as an example .",
    "therefore @xmath76 should remain massless on the kink ( or also on the vortex as we shall see in the next section ) .    in the end",
    ", we summarize this subsection by writing the total effective action obtained from the above fluctuation analysis .",
    "the gauge field @xmath51 does not appear in the low energy region .",
    "we substitute the lowest fluctuation modes into the action ( [ 98-ac ] ) and obtain @xmath79 in the second equality , we have used the fact that @xmath80 and @xmath54 are independent of @xmath57 .",
    "the third equality is obtained by the integration over the transverse direction . due to the gaussian factor",
    ", we can say that the defect described by the action ( [ effec ] ) is located at @xmath81 .",
    "this action ( [ effec ] ) is precisely identical with the effective action of a non - bps d8-brane .",
    "the difference from the action of the mz model ( [ mzaction ] ) is that now it is generalized to incorporate the transverse scalar field on the non - bps brane .",
    "the way it is included in is just the same as the two - derivative truncation of the bsft action for the non - bps d8-brane .",
    "thus , we have shown the decent relation from d9@xmath79 system to the non - bps d8-brane by directly examining the fluctuations around the kink solution of the d9@xmath79 effective action .",
    "although the results obtained in the previous subsection are desirable , they may depend on the choice of the effective theories . in this subsection , we show that the results of the previous subsection are in fact quite general , in the sense that the results do not depend on the specific form of the lagrangian .",
    "if we remember that the preferable properties of the mz model are intrinsically due to its relation to the bsft , the general lagrangian should be constrained by some results of the bsft . here",
    "we respect the properties of the bsft action derived for linear tachyon profiles . since in the bsft",
    "it is difficult to treat @xmath51 generically , we neglect this gauge field in this general approach .",
    "the symmetries which the model should have are ( i ) lorentz invariance , ( ii ) gauge invariance with respect to @xmath76 , and ( iii ) the global gauge invariance associated originally with @xmath51 , @xmath82 employing the bsft and the sigma - model result , the coupling between the gauge field @xmath76 and the tachyon is determined ( under the assumption that we consider the constant gauge field strength and neglect the tachyon higher derivatives @xmath83 ) as @xmath84 in the above expression the invariants @xmath85 and @xmath86 are defined as @xmath87 and the metric @xmath88 is in the well - known form , @xmath89 we omit the upper case @xmath90 here and in the rest of this subsection .    in order for the fluctuation analysis to be performed",
    ", we require that a classical solution of the above system should be a linear profile of the tachyon : @xmath91 then the equations of motion become a constraint on the unknown function @xmath92 : @xmath93_{x = q^2 , y = q^4}=0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    first let us carry out the @xmath53 fluctuation . substituting @xmath94 and @xmath34 into the action ( [ geneac ] ) and picking up the quadratic terms",
    ", we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath96_{x = q^2 , y = q^4}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that we use the equation of motion ( [ sft - eq3 ] ) here .",
    "then the mass squared is @xmath97 therefore there is a massless mode which corresponds to the transverse scalar field on the non - bps d8-brane , that is the same as in the derivative truncated case .",
    "it is straightforward to check that this is also the case for the @xmath62 fluctuation .",
    "substituting @xmath98 into the action , we have @xmath99_{\\!\\ !    \\begin{array}{l } \\mbox{\\scriptsize $ x = q^2 $ } \\\\[-2 mm ]   \\mbox{\\scriptsize $ y = q^4 $ }    \\end{array } } \\!\\ !",

    "the analysis for the gauge fluctuations gives the following quadratic action , @xmath101 the remarkable point is the vanishing of the @xmath102 terms , therefore we have no massive tower , as opposed to the case of the two - derivative truncation .",
    "we have only the massless gauge mode localized on the kink solution .",
    "note that , as for the gauge field , our general analysis does not include the action ( [ 98-ac ] ) of the previous subsection , because we have another contribution for @xmath103 from the metric @xmath104 .",
    "the lowest modes for the tachyon fluctuations @xmath56 and @xmath105 are independent of @xmath57 , as before . on the other hand ,",
    "as seen above , the gauge fluctuation has no tower and hence no information on its @xmath57 dependence , thus we can not include the gauge fluctuation in obtaining the effective action of the kink in the same manner as ( [ effec ] ) .",
    "however , in the expression ( [ gaugeflu ] ) the gaussian factor in front of the field strength behave as a space - dependent dielectric constant @xcite , thus the massless gauge field is localized on the kink .",
    "we conclude that we have obtained the precise field content on the non - bps d8-brane by the fluctuation analysis in the general action ( [ geneac ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , how the stable bps branes appear in the tachyon condensation of the brane antibrane system is the basis of the k - theory argument .",
    "after the development of the techniques to deal with the tachyon condensation such as the bsft , we can now closely look at the nucleation of the lower dimensional bps d - branes after the tachyon condenses . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the creation of a bps d7-brane as a vortex solution , ) `` vortex '' . ] from the tachyon condensation of the d9@xmath79 system . after constructing the solution",
    ", we perform the fluctuation analysis and then see if the precise worldvolume field content appears on the vortex d7-brane .",
    "we will see that the general analysis independent of the form of the action , studied in sec .",
    "2.3 , can be applied also here .",
    "finally we derive the dbi action as an effective field theory of the fluctuation modes .      since the inclusion of the gauge fields is accompanied by some complication which we shall see in sec .",
    "3.3 , first we consider a simple situation where we treat only the complex tachyon field .",
    "the action in the two derivative truncation is written as @xmath106 although the d7-brane should be realized as a co - dimension two vortex solution of the tachyon system , the well - known derrick s theorem @xcite prohibit us from proceeding .",
    "let us recall how derrick s theorem applies to our situation with the action ( [ trun2 ] ) .",
    "make the tachyon profile to depend only on two coordinates among the worldvolume directions , and suppose that we have a finite energy solution @xmath107 .",
    "then , the rescaling @xmath108 changes the energy ( action ) to @xmath109 where @xmath110 . since @xmath111 with @xmath112 should minimizes the energy @xmath113 , we obtain @xmath114 which tells us that the tachyon solution should sit at the potential minimum everywhere , @xmath115 this shows that there exists no vortex solution as far as we employ the action ( [ trun2 ] ) . to avoid this no - go theorem",
    ", we have to include terms supplying negative powers in @xmath116 to stabilize the system against the rescaling , such as tachyon higher derivative terms or gauge field kinetic terms . in this and",
    "the next subsections , we adopt the first approach . for the latter approach ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "let us consider an action of the four derivative truncation .",
    "the form of the additional terms respects the bsft results@xcite , @xmath117 new coefficients @xmath118 and @xmath119 are some numerical constant .",

    "assuming that the tachyon solution is linear , the equations of motion for this action ( [ 4d - ac ] ) reduce to @xmath127 -t ( { \\partial}_\\mu { \\bar{t}})^2 \\left [ 1 + 2(p_1 + p_2)|{\\partial}_\\nu t|^2 \\right ] = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a linear vortex solution is found as @xmath128 where the real parameter @xmath129 satisfies @xmath130 .",

    "let us consider @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) linear in @xmath198 .",

    "finally we have obtained the dbi action as an effective action of the vortex solution .",

    "we should make comments about the assumptions we made in this paper and their validity . throughout the paper we studied fluctuation spectra for field by field , however generically there are mixing terms even at the quadratic level .",
    "it seems very difficult to diagonalize the total system , and thus we neglected these cross terms naively , then the mass squared of the fluctuations are given correctly .",

    "one can show that the lowest modes of @xmath56 and @xmath105 obtained there satisfy also the total equations of motion of them with mixings , hence this mixing seems irrelevant .",

    "the only salvation is that in the general treatment of sec .",
    "3.3 , the mixing terms for @xmath76 vanish generically .",
