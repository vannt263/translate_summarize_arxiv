    "the issue of the non - perturbative renormalization of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interactions in chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) has been intensively investigated by many authors ( for detailed reviews , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , generating a great deal of discussion and debate regarding the consistency of the approach originally proposed by weinberg @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure for the non - perturbative renormalization of @xmath0 interactions in the context of weinberg s approach to cheft can be divided in two steps @xcite . in the first step",
    ", one has to solve a regularized lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation for the scattering amplitude by iterating the effective @xmath0 potential truncated at a given order in the chiral expansion , which includes long - range contributions from pion exchange interactions and short - range contributions parametrized by nucleon contact interactions .",
    "the most common scheme used to regularize the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in the ls equation is to introduce a sharp or smooth momentum cutoff regularizing function @xcite that suppresses the contributions from the potential matrix elements for momenta larger than a given momentum cutoff scale ( multi - pion exchange interactions also involve uv divergent loop integrals which must be consistently regularized and renormalized ) . in the second step",
    ", one has to determine the strengths of the contact interactions , the so called low - energy constants ( lec s ) , by fitting a set of low - energy scattering data .",
    "once the lec s are fixed at a given momentum cutoff scale , the ls equation can be solved to evaluate other observables .",
    "the @xmath0 interactions can be considered properly renormalized when the predicted observables are ( approximately ) independent of the momentum cutoff scale within the range of validity of cheft @xcite .",
    "the state of the art chiral @xmath0 potentials available to date , constructed within the framework of weinberg s approach to cheft , are the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading - order ( @xmath3 ) potentials of epelbaum , glckle and meissner @xcite and of entem and machleidt @xcite .",
    "both these potentials provide a very accurate description of @xmath0 scattering data below laboratory energies @xmath4 , with a @xmath5 comparable to that obtained by high - precision phenomenological potentials such as the nijmegen ii @xcite and the argonne v18 @xcite , and have been successfully applied in many nuclear structure and reaction calculations .",
    "furthermore , the leading chiral three - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) forces at @xmath1 have been derived @xcite and applied with fair success in calculations of few - nucleon reactions , light and medium nuclei , and infinite nuclear and neutron matter .",
    "subleading chiral @xmath6 forces at @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite have been recently worked out and are expected to resolve some challenging nuclear structure and reaction problems that remain open . for a review and a comprehensive list of references on the applications of cheft to few- and many - nucleon systems , see e.g. @xcite .    in spite of its remarkable phenomenological success ,",
    "the theoretical basis of weinberg s approach has been criticized . in particular ,",
    "conceptual questions have been raised regarding the formal inconsistency between weinberg s power counting scheme ( based on naive dimensional analysis ) and the non - perturbative renormalization of the @xmath0 interactions @xcite .",
    "such inconsistency arises from the non - renormalizability of cheft , which is a consequence of the highly singular nature of the interactions in the chiral expansion of the @xmath0 potential at short distances .",
    "the iteration of the @xmath0 potential truncated at a given order in the chiral expansion ( using the ls or the schrdinger equation ) generates higher - order uv divergences , and hence strong regularization scale dependencies , which can not be absorbed by the contact interactions ( counterterms ) included in the potential at that same order .",
    "thus , upon momentum cutoff regularization , the limit of infinite cutoff can not be taken while keeping the amplitudes finite and cutoff - independent , i.e. renormalization group invariant .",
    "so far , the issue of proper non - perturbative renormalization of chiral @xmath0 interactions remains controversial .",
    "from one side , in the successful cheft calculations based on weinberg s approach , implemented by using the chiral @xmath3 potentials mentioned above , finite cutoffs are typically chosen in the range @xmath8 and nearly cutoff - independent stable results are obtained provided the cutoff is varied only over a narrow window @xcite .",
    "a justification for such a setup with basis on lepage s view of renormalization in cutoff eft @xcite has been presented in the works of epelbaum and meissner @xcite and epelbaum and gegelia @xcite .",
    "still within the framework of finite cutoff calculations , it has been shown that the explicit inclusion of @xmath9 degrees of freedom in cheft improves the convergence of the chiral expansion for the @xmath0 interactions as compared to the theory with only pion and nucleon degrees of freedom @xcite . from the other side , the criticism to the consistency of weinberg s approach , and in particular to the narrow range of cutoffs for which it can provide renormalization group invariant results , led to the proposal of alternative renormalization approaches and power counting schemes such as those by kaplan , savage an wise @xcite , van kolck @xcite , nogga et al .",
    "@xcite , birse @xcite , valderrama @xcite , beane et al .",
    "@xcite and long et al .",
    "@xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "methods based on wilson s renormalization group @xcite have been successfully applied to analyze the scale dependence of chiral @xmath0 potentials , both in momentum space @xcite and in coordinate space @xcite , providing a better understanding of the interplay between the power counting and the non - perturbative renormalization in cheft .",
    "although much progress has been made in this direction , the construction of a consistent framework for the non - perturbative renormalization of @xmath0 interactions still remains an open problem @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the non - perturbative renormalization of @xmath0 interactions that has also been explored is the subtracted kernel method ( skm ) @xcite in which , instead of using a momentum cutoff regularizing function , the ls equation is regularized by performing multiple subtractions in the kernel at a given energy scale .",
    "a closely related subtractive renormalization approach is described in refs .",
    "@xcite , although in that case a sharp momentum cutoff is also introduced . in this work",
    "we apply the skm approach to the chiral @xmath0 interactions up to next - to - next - to - leading - order ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we consider the scattering of two nucleons in the @xmath2 channel and analyze the errors in the phase - shifts calculated at each order in weinberg s power counting scheme ( wpc ) and in a modified power counting scheme ( mpc ) based on the promotion of contact interactions which yields a systematic order - by - order power - law improvement .",
    "we also show , by explicit numerical calculations , that the skm procedure is renormalization group invariant under the change of the subtraction scale , provided the renormalized interactions are evolved through a non - relativistic callan - symanzik ( nrcs ) flow equation @xcite .",
    "we start by considering the chiral expansion for the effective @xmath0 potential in weinberg s power counting scheme ( wpc ) @xcite . in a partial - wave relative momentum space basis ,",

    "furthermore , as a consequence of the wigner causality bound @xcite we find that by taking a subtraction scale @xmath33 larger than @xmath114 it becomes impossible to fit the inverse on - shell @xmath52-matrix evaluated from the nijmegen - ii potential to within an acceptable accuracy while keeping the @xmath1 driving term @xmath75 hermitian ( i.e. , with the renormalized strengths @xmath79 taking only real values ) , such that the unitarity of the scattering amplitude is preserved .",
    "this is illustrated by the results obtained for @xmath115 , which can not reproduce well the nijmegen - ii phase - shifts even at very low energies , and so clearly indicate the breakdown of the fitting procedure .",

    "the wigner causality bound is a general result , originally derived by wigner @xcite assuming only the physical principles of causality and unitarity , which shows that for a hermitian potential that vanishes beyond some range @xmath121 there is a lower bound on the derivative of the phase - shifts @xmath122 with respect to the on - shell momentum @xmath80 , @xmath123 an alternative derivation was presented later by phillips and cohen @xcite , who have shown that wigner s bound yields a constraint on the effective range @xmath88 , given by @xmath124 where @xmath87 is the scattering length .",

    "thus , in both cases the renormalized potential must become non - hermitian in order to match the renormalization conditions , such that the unitarity of the scattering amplitude is violated ( nevertheless , the corresponding phase - shifts remain real ) .",
    "these results are similar to those we have obtained in our calculations for chiral @xmath0 interactions in the @xmath2 channel at @xmath64 and @xmath1 within the framework of the skm approach .",
    "the rather smaller value for the maximum subtraction scale @xmath138 we have found in the skm approach as compared to @xmath139 found in the cutoff renormalization scheme is a consequence of the highly non - trivial energy , momentum and subtraction scale dependence of the scattering amplitude @xmath140 obtained from the solution of the @xmath31-fold subtracted ls equation , eq .",
    "( [ subkn ] ) , which yields a very different running of the renormalized strengths of the contact interactions @xmath79 with the subtraction scale @xmath33 as determined by the renormalization conditions .",
    "it is important to emphasize that both in the cutoff renormalization scheme and the skm approach , wigner s bound arises from the non - linear structure of the renormalization conditions relating the strengths of the contact interactions @xmath12 to the ere parameters ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath141 , etc ) used as physical input @xcite .",
    "therefore , the constraint on the maximum value of the regularizing scale for which one can fit the experimental values of the ere parameters ( beyond zeroth order ) with a hermitian potential ( i.e. , with the strengths of the contact interactions @xmath12 taking only real values ) applies regardless of the particular procedure used to implement the fitting .",
    "as pointed before , the multiple subtractions performed in the skm procedure introduce a form factor in the kernel of the ls equation which acts like a regularizing function , such that the subtraction scale @xmath33 ends up playing a role similar to that of a smooth momentum cutoff scale .",
    "but the subtraction scale @xmath33 is arbitrary , and so the scattering observables calculated from the solution of the subtracted ls equation for the scattering amplitude should not depend on its particular choice . by requiring the fully off - shell @xmath52-matrix with @xmath31 subtractions to be invariant under the change of the subtraction scale @xmath33 , a renormalization group ( rg ) equation",
    "can be derived for the driving term @xmath34 in the form of a non - relativistic callan - symanzik ( nrcs ) flow equation @xcite , which is given in operator form by @xmath142 with the boundary condition @xmath143 imposed at some reference subtraction scale @xmath144 where the renormalized strengths of the contact interactions @xmath79 are fixed to fit low - energy observables used as physical input .",
    "the nrcs flow equation for the driving term @xmath60 is similar to the rg equation for the @xmath0 potential derived by birse in the context of cutoff eft @xcite , which is also obtained from the invariance of the off - shell @xmath52-matrix .",
    "another similar rg equation is that derived by bogner et al . in the @xmath145 approach @xcite , which is based on the invariance of the half - on - shell @xmath21-matrix such that it also involves the iteration of the scattering amplitude .                in order to explicitly demonstrate the renormalization group invariance in the skm approach , we consider the evolution through the nrcs flow equation of the @xmath10 channel driving term at @xmath1 in the mpc scheme . in a partial - wave relative momentum space basis ,",
    "the nrcs flow equation for the matrix - elements of the driving term @xmath60 in uncoupled channels is given by @xmath146\\nonumber \\\\&\\times & v^{(n)}_{\\mu}(p , q;k^2)~v^{(n)}_{\\mu}(q , p';k^2 ) \\ ; .",
    "\\label{csenpw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we solve eq .",
    "( [ csenpw ] ) numerically for @xmath93 , obtaining an exact ( non - perturbative ) solution for the evolved @xmath10 channel driving term @xmath75 .",
    "the relative momentum space is discretized on a grid of @xmath147 gaussian integration points , leading to a system of @xmath148 non - linear first - order coupled differential equations which is solved using an adaptative fifth - order runge - kutta algorithm . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the evolution of the diagonal matrix - elements ( top panels ) and the off - diagonal matrix - elements ( bottom panels ) of the @xmath10 channel driving term @xmath75 from a reference subtraction scale @xmath149 to @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 for several values of @xmath90 .",
    "one should note that the solution of the nrcs flow equation leads to a non - trivial evolution of the driving term @xmath75 with the sliding subtraction scale @xmath33 .",
    "the change in the form of the driving term is not only due to the running of the renormalized strengths of the contact interactions @xmath79 but also due to the new operators that are generated by the nrcs flow .",
    "channel obtained with the driving term @xmath75 at @xmath1 in the mpc scheme evolved through the nrcs equation . for comparison , we also show the phase - shifts obtained with the driving term @xmath153 computed at the reference scale @xmath154 ( solid line ) . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the evolution of the @xmath10 channel driving term @xmath75 through the nrcs equation ensures that the phase - shifts calculated from the solution of the ls equation for the @xmath155-fold subtracted @xmath52-matrix remain invariant ( except for relative differences smaller than @xmath156 due to numerical errors ) .",
    "remarkably , this result still holds even when the driving term is evolved to subtraction scales @xmath33 which are beyond the limit imposed by the wigner causality bound ( such as @xmath157 ) .",
    "this can be understood in the following way . as pointed before ,",
    "the input physical information ( e.g. the experimental values of the ere parameters @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath141 , etc ) is encoded in the initial driving term @xmath158 , which is determined by fixing the renormalized strengths @xmath159 of the contact interactions at the reference subtraction scale @xmath160 to fit data and sets the boundary condition for the nrcs evolution .",
    "thus , once the constraint imposed by wigner s bound is fulfilled at the boundary condition , provided one chooses a reference scale @xmath161 ( which in this case is @xmath162 ) , the nrcs flow equation , eq .",
    "( [ csenpw ] ) , can be solved to evolve the driving term to any subtraction scale @xmath33 while keeping it hermitian .",
    "these results clearly show that the sliding subtraction scale @xmath33 vanishes as a physical parameter , the only relevant scale being the reference scale @xmath160 where the boundary condition for the nrcs evolution is determined .",
    "the subtracted kernel method ( skm ) approach presented in this work provides a powerful renormalization group invariant method to renormalize singular two - body interactions .",
    "the iterative procedure involving recursive multiple subtractions performed in the kernel of the scattering equation allows for a systematic treatment of chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) potentials up to higher - orders in the chiral expansion , which include pion - exchange and contact interactions that present increasingly strong singularities at short - distances .",
    "this also makes the skm approach a convenient tool to implement power - counting schemes in which higher - order contact interactions are promoted to lower - order , since ultraviolet ( uv ) power divergences of any order can be properly handled by performing a number of subtractions enough to render a finite amplitude .",
    "a disadvantage of the skm formalism is that the computational load increases as more subtractions are performed : in order to compute the @xmath31-fold subtracted amplitude , the iterative procedure requires @xmath31 matrix inversions .",
    "we have shown that a modified power counting scheme ( mpc ) based on the promotion of contact interactions , such that at each order in the chiral expansion one new contact interaction is included in the effective @xmath0 potential , yields a systematic order - by - order power - law improvement in the @xmath10 channel phase - shifts calculated up to next - to - next - to - leading - order ( @xmath1 ) , that is lacking in weinberg s power counting scheme ( wpc ) .",
    "our results show that the scaling of the relative errors at low - energies is nearly dominated by the tuning of the renormalized strengths of the contact interactions , and so suggest that the short - range contact interactions are relatively more important than the long - range pion - exchange interactions .",
    "an essential ingredient in our calculations is the procedure employed to fix the renormalized strengths of the contact interactions , based on the fitting of  data \" generated from the nijmegen ii potential for a spread of very low on - shell momenta , which allows for a clear analysis of the error scaling of predicted phase - shifts , and hence of the power counting , using  lepage plots \" .",
    "such a procedure is equivalent to a fitting of the experimental values of the effective range expansion ( ere ) parameters ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath141 , etc ) to a given order in @xmath85 , where @xmath80 is the on - shell momentum in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "one should note that we are not analyzing the power counting at the level of the chiral expansion for the @xmath0 potential , but  a posteriori \" at the level of the observables , i.e. after iterating the potential in the subtracted lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation .",
    "the lack of power - law improvement in the @xmath10 channel phase - shifts we have observed at @xmath1 in the wpc scheme shows that the corresponding subtracted amplitude do not follow the power counting of the chiral @xmath0 potential , which is the motivation for our mpc scheme . as pointed out by several works @xcite , a consequence of the singular nature of the chiral @xmath0 interactions at short - distances",
    "is that the full iteration of the potential in the scattering equation can change the scaling behavior of each of the interactions included , and hence their relative importance to the amplitude , thus leading to modifications of the power counting at the level of the observables .",
    "we have also demonstrated by explicit numerical calculations for the scattering of two - nucleons in the @xmath10 channel that the skm procedure applied to the chiral @xmath0 interactions up to @xmath1 is renormalization group invariant under the change of the subtraction scale .",
    "once the renormalized strengths of the contact interactions are fixed at a reference scale to fit low - energy scattering observables , the subtraction scale can be changed by evolving the driving term of the subtracted ls equation through a non - relativistic callan - symanzik ( nrcs ) flow equation , such that the results for the calculated phase - shifts remain invariant . moreover ,",
    "the sliding subtraction scale to which the driving term can be evolved is not constrained by the wigner causality bound . in this way",
    ", the sliding subtraction scale vanishes as a physical parameter .",
    "the relevant scale parameter left in the theory is the reference scale where the boundary condition of the nrcs flow equation is determined through the input of physical information , which can then be regarded as a renormalization scale .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in order to properly assess the effectiveness of the mpc scheme we have described in this work , as well as the renormalization group invariance in the skm approach , it is necessary to carry out the calculations up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading - order ( @xmath3 ) and perform a comprehensive analysis for all partial - wave channels relevant at low - energies ( e.g. for total angular momentum @xmath163 ) . in particular , the calculations for the lower partial - waves would be essential to address the consequences of our results for applications of cheft to few- and many - nucleon systems ( e.g. light - nuclei , and nuclear and neutron matter ) .",
    "if we do find , for all relevant partial - wave channels and up to @xmath3 , that a systematic order - by - order power - law improvement can be achieved through the mpc scheme and the @xmath0 phase - shifts remain invariant under the change of the subtraction scale through the nrcs flow equation , then it would be reasonable to expect that similar results may also be obtained when applying the skm approach to few- and many - nucleon systems . of course this",
    "must be verified through explicit calculations , which would require the extension of the skm approach to solve dynamical equations pertinent to nuclear few- and many - body problems ( e.g. the faddeev - yakubovsky equations @xcite and the bethe - brueckner - goldstone equations @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , due to its sensitivity to the short - range contributions to the chiral @xmath0 potential @xcite , the @xmath10 channel provides a good starting point to investigate the interplay between the pion - exchange and the contact interactions in the non - perturbative renormalization of @xmath0 interactions in cheft .    in forthcoming works",
    ", we will extend the calculations presented here to other partial - wave channels and up to @xmath3 , aiming to perform a systematic analysis of the power counting and the renormalization group invariance in the skm approach for chiral @xmath0 interactions .",
    "in particular , we will investigate in detail the impact of the long - range pion - exchange interactions and their interplay with the short - range contact interactions .",
    "we also intend to compare the evolution of chiral @xmath0 interactions through the nrcs equation in the skm approach with the evolution through birse s renormalization group ( rg ) equation in cutoff eft , both in a perturbative and in a non - perturbative renormalization framework .",
    "furthermore , we want to investigate the possibility of generalizing the skm approach to renormalize cheft potentials including three- and four - nucleon interactions .",
    "we believe that this generalization can be worked out by using techniques similar to those developed in the context of eft for three - body systems with contact interactions @xcite , which allow to obtain renormalized amplitudes by performing subtractions in the three - body scattering equations . by accomplishing such a generalization",
    ", we expect to be able to apply the skm approach in sensible calculations of few- and many - nucleon systems ."
