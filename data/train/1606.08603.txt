    "<S> we establish a quantum version of the classical isoperimetric inequality relating the fisher information and the entropy power of a quantum state . the key tool is a fisher information inequality for a state which results from a certain convolution operation : the latter maps a classical probability distribution on phase space and a quantum state to a quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this inequality also gives rise to several related inequalities whose counterparts are well - known in the classical setting : in particular , it implies an entropy power inequality for the mentioned convolution operation as well as the isoperimetric inequality , and establishes concavity of the entropy power along trajectories of the quantum heat diffusion semigroup . as an application , we derive a log - sobolev inequality for the quantum ornstein - uhlenbeck semigroup , and argue that it implies fast convergence towards the fixed point for a large class of initial states . </S>"
