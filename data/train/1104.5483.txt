    "galaxy merging is both predicted and observed to play an important role in galaxy growth and evolution , a number of groups studying the high - redshift universe have found that the early type galaxy population is growing in stellar mass over time @xcite , especially at very high ( @xmath9 ) redshift @xcite , although it appears to be growing mainly at luminosities around @xmath10 and below @xcite .",
    "these red galaxies show low levels of star formation , so star formation is unlikely to provide the growth .",
    "the number density of massive blue galaxies is far lower than that of red galaxies , so transformations of massive blue galaxies is unlikely to provide the growth either .    in the cdm paradigm for structure formation , galaxies reside in mass concentrations that are built from the merging and accretion of smaller concentrations over cosmic time .",
    "some recent merger rates have been predicted in theories of galaxy formation in a cosmological context @xcite .",
    "there are many galaxy  galaxy merger rate estimates in the literature .",
    "some involve identifying a class of premerger close pairs @xcite .",
    "one makes use of a class of postmerger galaxies based on star formation indicators @xcite .",
    "another relies on finding merging sources based on disturbed or merging morphologies @xcite . in each case , the estimate of the merger rate proceeds by estimating the abundance of the class and some time interval over which they remain identifiably part of that class .",
    "we have found previously that luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) are growing on average by less than 2 @xmath7 , from merger activity at redshifts @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "galaxies are found to separate into two distinct regions in color - magnitude space : the red sequence and the blue cloud @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider galaxies on both sides of this divide .",
    "we estimate the merger rate with close pairs by cross - correlating two different galaxy sets : galaxies from nyu vagc spectroscopic sample and galaxies from sdss imaging sample .",
    "our technique for measuring the close pairs builds on our previous work @xcite . with this technique ,",
    "we can measure projected correlation functions on extremely small scales ( kpc to mpc scales ) without the need for complete spectroscopic samples , and we can also go to much fainter sources in the imaging sample than we could if we required spectra for everything .",
    "furthermore , our results will not be affected by projection effects , because cross - correlation removes by - chance interlopers naturally .",
    "we go beyond our previous work by considering a range of galaxy masses and colors that is far broader than just the lrg sample . in this paper",
    ", we measure the correlation functions and growth rates for galaxies of the full range of properties to which the sdss main sample @xcite is sensitive .",
    "the primary uncertainty in turning a deprojected three - dimensional cross - correlation function at small scales into a merger rate is in estimating the mean time for two galaxies to merge as a function of galaxy masses and separation .",
    "there are different estimates of merger timescale : free - fall time , orbital time , and dynamical friction time ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we will use an approximation to the dynamical friction time as our standard estimate .",
    "in addition , we will use an orbital time for comparison .",
    "even the ( longer ) dynamical friction time is likely to be an under - estimate of the mean merger time , because some close pairs will not merge at all .",
    "any under - estimate of the merger time leads to an over - estimate of the growth rate .    throughout this paper , all magnitudes are ab ,",
    "all masses are stellar masses @xmath12 , all velocities are @xmath13 , all error bars showed in our figures are from the the jackknife error covariance matrix only , and all volumes and distances are comoving , calculated for a cosmological world model with @xmath14 and hubble constant @xmath15 .",
    "we use the nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( vagc ) v7.2 data @xcite , which is built from sdss data , as our source of spectroscopic data .",
    "we use all the sdss imaging data as our source for cross - correlation samples .",
    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of about @xmath16 square degrees @xcite .",
    "we use a spectroscopic sample drawn from nyu vagc v7.2 data .",
    "it contains about @xmath17 main galaxies , of which about @xmath2 sdss main samples galaxies @xcite are in the redshift range @xmath18 ( see figure  [ fig : decvsra ] ) .",
    "we use the code sdss_kcorrect @xcite to calculate the @xmath19-corrected absolute magnitude at @xmath20 and stellar mass for each .",
    "we cut this sample into 10 subsamples by stellar mass and make sure that in each subsamples the number of galaxies is the same .",
    "after that , we cut them into red and blue using the cut @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the stellar mass .",
    "these cut the spectroscopic sample into 20 spectroscopic subsamples ; we call these subsamples @xmath23 ( see figure  [ fig : colorvsmass ] ) . for",
    "the red spectroscopic subsamples , we name the smallest stellar - mass subsample ` red0 ' , then name the second smallest stellar - mass subsample ` red1 ' , and so on , so the largest stellar - mass subsample is named ` red9 ' , and the same for the blue spectroscopic subsamples .",
    "figures  [ fig : densityred ] and [ fig : densityblue ] show the number density of galaxies of the 18 spectroscopic subsamples as a function of redshift .",
    "the red0 and blue0 subsamples are low in number density , and highly affected by survey selection effects , so we do not use them further .",
    "we can see that blue8 , blue9 and red9 appear to rise in number density with redshift , this is because we removed galaxies with @xmath24 .    in the sdss",
    ", spectroscopic targets were assigned to spectroscopic fiber plug plates with a tiling algorithm that ensures nearly complete samples @xcite .",
    "the angular completeness is characterized for each unique region of overlapping spectroscopic plates ( sector ) on the sky .",
    "an operational constraint of the sdss spectrographs , however , is that the physical size of the fiber coupling restricts the angular separations of targets on any individual spectroscopic plate to be larger than 55 arcsec .",
    "this fiber collision constraint causes about 9 percent of target galaxies not to have measured redshifts . because this project involves cross - correlating spectroscopic and imaging objects , this fiber collision limit only comes into our analysis in our weighting scheme to account for incompleteness ; it does not affect our pair counts directly , unless the unmeasured galaxies have very different cross - correlation amplitude with fainter galaxies than the measured galaxies ( this is not likely ) .    for each galaxy @xmath25 in the spectroscopic subsample we compute a weight @xmath26 that accounts statistically for the spectroscopic incompleteness coming from fiber collisions .",
    "we calculate this weight by running a two - dimensional friends - of - friends grouping algorithm on the sdss target parent sample in the nyu vagc v7.2 , with a 55-arcsec linking length .",
    "this procedure emulates the sdss tiling algorithm @xcite . within each collision group made by the friends - of - friends algorithm",
    ", we find the number of objects with measured spectroscopic redshifts and divide by the total number .",
    "the inverse of this ratio is a weight @xmath26 assigned to each spectroscopic galaxies to account for survey incompleteness .",
    "all @xmath27 .",
    "we have created large catalogs of randomly distributed points for each of the spectroscopic subsamples based on the sdss subsample angular and radial ( redshift distribution ) models .",
    "these catalogs match the redshift distribution of the corresponding spectroscopic subsample and are isotropic within the survey region . in order to exactly match the redshift distribution",
    ", for each galaxy in each spectroscopic subsample , we created 10 galaxies with the exactly same redshift but angular position taken from the random sample .",
    "thus each spectroscopic subsample @xmath23 obtains a random catalog which is 10 times as large as @xmath23 .",
    "these catalogs provide a homogeneous baseline ( expected numbers ) for the tests that follow .",
    "we call them @xmath28 .    for each random point @xmath25",
    "we compute a weight @xmath29 that accounts for the incompleteness of the spectroscopic survey in that point s region of the sky _ not _ due to fiber collision but due to all the other selection effects in the survey .",
    "the nyu vagc v7.2 provides the angular geometry of the spectroscopic survey expressed in terms of spherical polygons .",
    "the geometry is complicated : the spectroscopic plates are circular and overlap , while the imaging is in long strips on the sky , and there are overlap regions for some plates that have not yet been observed .",
    "the resulting spherical polygons track all these effects @xcite and characterize the geometry in terms of sectors , each being a unique region of overlapping spectroscopic plates . in each sector",
    ", we count the number of possible targets ( lrg , main , and quasar ) , excluding those missed because of fiber collisions , and the number of these whose redshifts were determined .",

    "each time we consider a pair of galaxies , one from the spectroscopic subsample and one from the imaging subsample , we assign the spectroscopic redshift to the galaxy from the imaging sample .",
    "this allows us to calculate for each galaxy from the imaging sample in each spectroscopic  imaging pair a temporary @xmath19-corrected stellar mass and [ @xmath38 color for the purposes of that pair .",
    "we discard these values and compute new ones when the galaxy from the imaging sample is used in another pair with another galaxy from the spectroscopic sample .    to save time",

    "the mass growth rates shown in the solid lines in figure  [ fig : growth1 ] are upper limits on the true fractional mass growth .",
    "there are two reasons : _ ( 1 ) _",
    "we assume @xmath230 for every pair .",
    "however it is not true for close pairs in high velocity - dispersion environments , and the chandrasekhar formula may be an overestimate @xcite when the pairs are bound , _ ( 2 ) _",
    "we assume that the stellar mass growth of the central galaxies from the spectroscopic sample is equal to the stellar mass of the galaxy from the imaging sample , see equation ( [ eq : growth ] ) .",
    "however @xcite found that up to @xmath231 percent of the stars in the galaxies from the imaging sample could be stripped off before the merger with lrgs is complete .",
    "so our mass growth rate under dynamical friction assumption is an upper limit on the growth by merging .",
    "we find that the accretion onto red and massive blue galaxies is dominated by mergers with red companions , and that onto small - mass blue galaxies , red and blue companions make comparable contributions , this is shown by table [ tab : data1 ] and figures  [ fig : growthred ] and [ fig : growthblue ] .",
    "so , most of the mass brought into red galaxies by merging is brought by red companions or `` dry mergers '' @xcite , and most of it brought into very massive galaxies ( lrgs ) is brought by galaxies near ( or above ) @xmath232 .",
    "we find that all the contributions to growth decrease with decreasing stellar mass at the small - mass end for all of 18 spectroscopic subsamples . the contribution to growth decreases with decreasing @xmath166 since @xmath233 .",
    "for all 18 subsamples , the curves essentially decrease to zero by @xmath234 for @xmath235 and by @xmath236 for @xmath237 , so calculation of the total amount of mass brought in by merger activities does not require consideration of galaxies from the imaging sample with @xmath234 .",
    "the principal limitation of the imaging sample arises from the lack of spectroscopic information on the galaxies from the imaging sample .",
    "however , for galaxies from imaging sample with stellar masses @xmath175 , we estimate the real - space number densities @xmath93 from equation ( [ eq : wpwithoutni ] ) .",
    "so we measured @xmath93 , @xmath186 and @xmath80 separately .",
    "but at stellar masses @xmath174 , it is impossible to precisely measure the real - space number densities @xmath93 , so that we can not disentangle the clustering power from the number density for these small - mass galaxies from the imaging sample , and we only measure the products @xmath131 and @xmath129 but not either @xmath93 , @xmath186 or @xmath80 separately .",
    "figures  [ fig : nwpredwithred ] through [ fig : nwpbluewithblue ] show the results of our measurements of @xmath129",
    ". the sharp break at at @xmath238 and the less - sharp transition at @xmath239 , which can also be observed in figure  [ fig : zehavi_wp ] , can be explained in the context of the `` halo occupation '' picture of galaxy clustering @xcite , and these two transitions are clearer in figure  [ fig : nwpredwithred ] of mergers between two red galaxies than that in the other three figures .",
    "the mergers at @xmath240 are the one - halo mergers ( both of the two merging galaxies are inside one halo ) , and the mergers at @xmath241 are the two - halo mergers ( the two merging galaxies are separately inside two nearby halos ) , and the mergers at @xmath242 are the mixed - halo mergers ( some of the mergers are the one - halo mergers , the others are the two - halo mergers ) .",
    "so at @xmath239 the mergers trasfer from the one - halo mergers to the mixed - halo mergers , and at @xmath238 the mergers trasfer from the mixed - halo mergers to the two - halo mergers .",
