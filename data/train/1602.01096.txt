    "constraining the dust content of galaxies is vital to improving our knowledge of star formation histories and galaxy evolution .",

    "correcting for these effects is necessary to understand the intrinsic properties of a galaxy . for nearby galaxies ,",
    "spectroscopy provides insight into these effects .",
    "however , because spectroscopy requires significantly more telescope time and brighter targets than photometry , photometry is a better choice for large , deep samples .    beyond the local universe , galactic properties",
    "are often determined by fitting stellar population synthesis models to a handful of photometric points , then assigning redshifts , ages , metallicities , masses , etc . to the galaxy based on the best fitting sed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the use of medium band near - ir filters in the newfirm medium band survey ( nmbs ; * ? ? ? * ) and the fourstar evolution survey ( zfourge ; * ? ? ? * submitted ) has enabled more accurate photometric redshift ( @xmath9 ) measurements of large numbers of galaxies , on the order of @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 ) when compared to higher quality redshifts from grism @xcite and spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "these surveys also cover legacy fields which have extensive photometric observations from the rest - frame uv to the near - ir .",
    "the combination of greater photometric sampling and near - ir filters which identify the 4000 @xmath12 break allow for a more constrained sed fit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this makes these surveys prime datasets for the development of multi - wavelength composite seds .",
    "if one can determine which galaxies have intrinsically similar seds , then by de - redshifting and scaling photometry for galaxies at several redshifts one can generate a well - sampled composite sed . over the last few years",

    "this allows us to build composite seds from galaxies at higher redshifts and lower masses than previous studies while still maintaining precision in our @xmath9 measurements .",
    "the optical to near - infrared ( ir ) sed characterizes the properties of the stellar populations . to better track total star formation , rest - frame mid - far ir observations , which indicate the amount of dust heated by young , massive stars , are essential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) flux more directly traces these stars , and the ratio of these two components , the infrared excess ( irx ) , is a tracer of dust attenuation in the uv .",
    "the uv slope ( @xmath4 ) is also sensitive to the effects of dust @xcite , and it can be compared to the irx to determine how dust attenuation affects the light of star - forming galaxies .",
    "this irx@xmath5 relation has been fit for various samples in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and in some cases compared to samples at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "notably , @xcite found that ( u)lirgs in the local universe do show significant scatter about irx@xmath5 relations , largely due to variations in ir flux .",
    "the resulting relations have also been used to derive properties such as continuum reddening @xcite and distributions of dust in dust - obscured galaxies ( dogs ) @xcite .",
    "several of these works found discrepancies between high-@xmath14 dusty star - forming galaxies and local irx@xmath5 relations .",
    "many of these studies estimate ir fluxes from a single photometric point , usually a _ spitzer_/mips 24 @xmath3 flux .",

    "we use photometric data from the deep near - ir zfourge survey ( * ? ? ? * submitted ) , covering the cdfs @xcite , cosmos @xcite , and uds @xcite fields , as well as archival data to obtain photometric coverage over observed wavelengths ranging from 0.3 @xmath3 to 8 @xmath3 .",
    "the near - ir filters of zfourge split the traditional @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands into 3 and 2 medium - band filters , respectively .",

    "note that the errorbars on the composite sed points are @xmath30 errors on the medians and do not represent the errors in the photometry of the analogs .",
    "in addition , a number of galaxies have negative flux measurements in the ir because their photometry is dominated by noise in the background - subtracted images ; these are plotted as downward arrows in figure [ fig : composites ] .",

    "we fit the scaled rest - frame uv data from our composite seds with a power law of the form @xmath33 . in this work we use photometry with rest - frame wavelengths in the range @xmath34 to fit the uv slope , similar to the range of the @xcite fitting windows , and mask points within 175 @xmath12 of the 2175 @xmath12 feature @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the composite seds most discrepant from the @xcite relation are those with the highest average ir flux among their analogs , in agreement with @xcite ( @xmath46 and @xcite ( @xmath47 ) . however , many of these studies used uv- or ir - selected samples , whereas our work uses the largest sample yet of mass - selected galaxies at @xmath47 .",
    "more recently , @xcite analyzed the @xmath48 relation using high - redshift uv spectra of 62 ir - detected galaxies at @xmath6 , obtaining a much flatter fit than previous work , although still broadly consistent with predictions based on the calzetti attenuation law .",
    "our work , utilizing photometry only , includes a much larger sample , suggesting that previous works making use of local irx@xmath5 relations incorrectly estimate the extinction of the uv continuum for high redshift dust - obscured samples .",
    "this offset implies that the dust attenuation at redshifts @xmath49 is different from that in local galaxies ; specifically , the steeper slope of our @xmath50 relation means that dusty star - forming galaxies in our sample s redshift range have more uv attenuation due to dust than would be assumed from local calibrations .",
    "this amounts to a 0.5 magnitude underestimate of 1600 @xmath12 attenuation for galaxies with @xmath51 , increasing towards @xmath52 , and becoming consistent with the m99 relation for @xmath53 .",

    "while the irx trend more or less parallels the distribution of the star - forming composite seds , it is apparent that the @xmath54 vector on the _ uvj _ diagram does not parallel the color evolution of star - forming galaxies as @xmath32 does @xcite .",
