    "frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) systems with guard - time interval or cyclic prefix can prevent inter - symbol interference ( isi ) .",
    "ofdm has overlapping spectra and rectangular impulse responses .",
    "consequently , each ofdm sub - channel exhibits a sinc - shape frequency response .",
    "therefore , the time variations of the channel during one ofdm symbol duration destroy the orthogonality of different subcarriers , and result in power leakage among subcarriers , known as inter - carrier interference ( ici ) , which causes degradation in system performance . in order to overcome the above drawbacks of ofdm system , several pulse - shaping ofdm systems were proposed @xcite .",
    "it is shown that signal transmission through a rectangular lattice is suboptimal for doubly dispersive ( dd ) channel @xcite . by using results from sphere covering theory , the authors have demonstrated that hexagonal multi - carrier transmission ( hmct ) system obtains lower energy perturbation than ofdm system , hence providing better performance against isi / ici @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two types of hmct systems , ( 1 ) : hmct system with orthogonal prototype pulse@xcite , named as lattice ofdm ( lofdm ) system , which confines the transmission pulses to a set of orthogonal ones .",
    "( 2 ) : hmct system with nonorthogonal prototype pulse@xcite , named as hexagonal multicarrier transmission ( hmt ) system , which abandons the orthogonality condition of the modulated pulses and obtains the high robustness performance on combating the dispersion of dd propagation channel in both time and frequency domain .    to optimally combat the impact of the dd propagation channels , the lattice parameters in the time - frequency ( t - f ) plane and the pulse shape of modulation waveform of hmct system are jointly optimized to adapt to the channel scattering function .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the hmct system outperforms ofdm system from the robustness against channel dispersion point of view .",
    "the basic mathematical operation of the received signal performed by the demodulator is a projection onto an identically structured function set generated by the prototype pulse function @xcite , i.e. an optimal match filter . in hmct system , there is no cyclic prefix and data symbols of hmct signal are transmitted on hexagonal lattice points in the t - f plane .",
    "traditional timing and frequency synchronization schemes can not be applied to hmct system directly . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "signal to interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) of hmct system over dd channel is analyzed and the max - sinr based timing synchronization scheme is proposed .    in this paper ,",
    "a novel preamble structure and two carrier frequency offset estimation algorithms , named as phase differential algorithm and least squares algorithm , for hmct system are proposed .",
    "after detailed derivation , the close form performance lower bound of the proposed carrier frequency offset estimation algorithm is given .",
    "theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed carrier frequency estimation approach for hmct system obtains an approximation to the lower bound mean square error ( mse ) performance over dd channel .",
    "in hmct systems , the transmitted baseband signal can be expressed as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the lattice parameters , which can be viewed as the symbol period and the subcarrier separation , respectively ; @xmath3 denotes the transmitted data symbol , which is assumed to be taken from a specific signal constellation and independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with zero mean and average power @xmath4 ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the position indices in the t - f plane ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the sets from which @xmath9 can be taken , with cardinalities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the transmitted pulses generated by the prototype pulse @xmath14 . the ambiguity function of the prototype pulse is defined as @xmath15",
