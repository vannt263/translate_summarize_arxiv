    "the optical properties of bulk si and ge are rather mediocre because the light emission in the bulk si and ge is a phonon - assisted indirect process . therefore , to improve on the light emission feature in si - based materials",
    "is a challenge for both the technological and the fundamental research .",
    "the luminescence is a result of a significant overlap in electron and hole wave functions as the strength of the luminescence ( _ i.e. _ the emission rate and quantum efficiency ) depends on the extent of this overlap and the transition probability .",
    "possible means to increase this overlap for the si - based materials may be accomplished through , for example , alloying to change the band structure , impurities to produce the intermediate state through which the electron can recombine with the hole , or zone folding to yield the desired quasi - direct transition @xcite .",
    "however , the most important breakthrough in this issue is the observation of the visible photoluminescence ( pl ) from porous si @xcite and si quantum dots @xcite which opens new possibility for fabricating visible light emitting device from si - based materials .",
    "structural analysis of porous si is quite difficult .",
    "but several measurements have confirmed that the principal feature of porous si consists of extremely fine structures which are small enough to exhibit quantum confinement effects @xcite .",
    "various theoretical works have been reported on si nanowires @xcite and si clusters @xcite .",
    "they clarified that the quantum confinement effects give rise to the change in the electronic structure and the optical properties and are the principle mechanism of the blueshift pl in porous si and si quantum dots .",
    "there were experimental reports indicating that ge quantum dots embedded in sio@xmath3 glassy matrices @xcite or in porous si @xcite show a strong room temperature luminescence .",
    "theoretical studies on the structure and stability of ge clusters @xcite , the polarizabilities of small ge clusters @xcite , and the quantum confinement effect on excitons in ge quantum dots @xcite have also been reported .",
    "since ge has smaller electron and hole effective masses and a larger dielectric constant than the corresponding quantities for si , the effective bohr radius of the exciton in ge is larger than that in si , and the quantum confinement effect appears more pronounced in ge than in si @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that si@xmath0ge@xmath1 nanoclusters could be possible candidates to be used as components for nanoscale functional optical devices . in order to understand the physics of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters",
    ", we performed an _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulation for si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters of an intermediate size , and systematically studied their electronic and optical properties .",
    "there is no doubt that the mismatch effect dominating the electronic and optical properties in si@xmath4ge@xmath5 alloys may introduce interesting optical features in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters .",
    "but one has to keep in mind that the surface distortion associated with the stabilizing of the si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters will also play an important role .",
    "therefore the competition between the lattice mismatch and the surface distortion is the basic issue in our investigation . for this purpose",
    ", we studied si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters of an intermediate size with / without the hydrogen passivation . by comparing our results between the two sets of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters , we found that the surface distortion plays an important role in the intermediate size of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters but the mismatch effect dominates when si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters of the intermediate size are passivated by hydrogen atoms to eliminate the dangling bonds so as to lessen the effect of the surface distortion .",
    "we also found that the latter shows an enhancement of radiative transition and a blueshift in pl .",
    "it should be noted that our simulations of the si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters without hydrogen passivation will lead only to one of the more stable configurations among a large number of structural isomers .",
    "hence its resulting structural and electronic properties may not exactly represent the corresponding properties of the true ground state configuration of the si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters .",
    "however this caveat does not affect the main conclusions of our study , including the role played by the lattice mismatch and the surface relaxation in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters with / without hydrogen passivation , and the enhanced radiative transition in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters .",
    "we considered 71-atom si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters , with @xmath6 taking on the values 0 , 18 , 35 , 53 , and 71 , respectively .",
    "the initial configurations for the five clusters were generated randomly on a regular tetrahedral network .",
    "they were then relaxed by the _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics scheme developed by sankey and co - workers ( the fireball scheme ) @xcite .",
    "this scheme is based on the density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lda ) , where a local basis set is used to construct the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "the basis functions are slightly excited pseudo - atomic orbitals ( pao ) .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals are calculated self - consistently using the hamann - schlter - chiang pseudo - potential @xcite and the ceperley - alder form of the exchange - correlation potential as parameterized by perdew and zunger @xcite .",
    "we have tested this method in the study of the strain relaxation of si@xmath4ge@xmath5 alloys and the results are in good agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "+ in our simulation , @xmath7-type paos were used with confinement radii of 5.0 @xmath8 , 5.2 @xmath8 , and 3.6 @xmath8 for si , ge , and h atoms , respectively . a cubic cell with a lattice constant 50 @xmath9 was chosen as the unit cell .",
    "this cell size is sufficiently large to ensure that spurious interactions between clusters will vanish . to obtain the stable configuration of a si@xmath0ge@xmath1 or a si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 cluster",
    ", molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the clusters , starting from the initial random configuration , at a temperature of 10@xmath11 k for about 20 ps until the network was equilibrated .",
    "the network was then slowly cooled to 300 k for 5 ps , and the dynamical quenching was finally performed to fully relax the system to zero k. charge transfer was calculated self - consistently in the simulations , which is important in modeling clusters .",
    "+ after performing the molecular dynamical simulations , we obtained stable configurations , five each for si@xmath0ge@xmath1 and si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters , with the ratio @xmath12 = 0.0 , 0.25 , 0.51 , 0.75 , and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) shows the stabilized configuration of the si@xmath13ge@xmath14 cluster . apparently , there is strong surface distortion in this case and the stabilized structure is a compact network in a more oblate structure",
    "this kind of structure has also been found to be more stable for the intermediate - size of si clusters from other theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "it is found that the surface distortion leads to local bonding configurations with more than four bonds , in particular in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "further structural analysis shows that the average bond lengths of si - si ( b@xmath15 ) , si - ge ( b@xmath16 ) , and ge - ge ( b@xmath17 ) of the si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters are expanded relative to the bulk , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "but they still maintain the relationship of @xmath18 and are almost independent of the ratio of @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    "( b ) , the average angles @xmath19 , which shows the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath21 atoms , are less than the tetrahedral angle , except @xmath22 in si@xmath23ge@xmath24 cluster .",
    "the large fluctuation of the average angles @xmath19 as a function of the ratio of @xmath12 indicates that the clusters have lost their initial tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "this means that the surface distortion strongly dominates in the intermediate size si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters , whatever the ratio of si / ge .    when the initial configurations were passivated with 84 h atoms to terminate the dangling bonds on the surface atoms , all the relaxed si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters still maintain a tetrahedral symmetry in the interior , with only a minor distortion on the surface .",
    "such features can be seen , for example , from the relaxed structure of si@xmath13ge@xmath14h@xmath10 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the average bond lengths b@xmath15 , b@xmath16 , and b@xmath17 of the cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) ) and the average angles @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( d ) ) are quite close to the corresponding features in si@xmath4ge@xmath5 alloys ( comparing figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) to figs . 3 and 7 in ref .",
    "this is an indication that the surface distortion in hydrogen - passivated clusters is weak even for si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath25 clusters of an intermediate size . on the other hand ,",
    "the mismatch effect becomes the dominating factor in hydrogenated si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters , similar to the situation exhibited in si@xmath4ge@xmath5 alloys @xcite .",
    "the lda calculation is known to underestimate the energy gap in the single - particle energy spectrum of semiconductor clusters .",
    "corrections to the underestimated energy gap can be calculated using the gw approach @xcite . however , gw calculations are expensive , even for clusters of an intermediate size considered in this work ( i.e. , si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters with @xmath2 ) .",
    "our main interest in this study is to provide an understanding of the trend of change in the electronic structure and optical properties of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters of a given size as the concentration of the ge component varies .",
    "the lda approach is expected to be sufficiently accurate to provide a qualitative description of this trend of change .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the electronic density of states ( edos ) of the relaxed si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters , using the same dft / lda scheme as that in the structural determination .",
    "the edoss of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 and si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters at the five ratios of @xmath12 described previously are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , many defect states associated with the surface distortion were seen in the homo - lumo energy gap region of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters .",
    "these defect states were cleared up when the surface was passivated by h atoms ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "3 ) because h atoms terminate the dangling bonds of the surface atoms , resulting in the clusters keeping the basic tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "even though the energy spectrum of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 and that of si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters are quite different , the general feature of the energy spectrum in both cases was found to be rather insensitive to the ratio of @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) illustrate the homo - lumo energy gap of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 and si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters as a function of the ratio of @xmath12 , respectively . because of the existence of the defect states in the energy gap region , the homo - lumo gap of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters is small ( only 0.4 - 0.5 ev ) and does not show any dependence on the ratio of si to ge .",
    "but the homo - lumo gap of the hydrogenated si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters is opened up to several ev ( 3.5 - 4.0 ev ) and shows a linear dependence on the ratio of si to ge which reflects the mismatch effect similar to that for the corresponding alloys @xcite .",
    "specifically , experimental observation @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite indicate that the lattice mismatch associated with alloying in si@xmath4ge@xmath5 alloys induces a change of the conduction band , in particular , the lowest energy in the conduction band ( lumo ) changes from the @xmath26 point near x point for si - rich alloys to the l point for ge - rich alloys @xcite , leading to a nearly linear decrease of the indirect band gap . in the case of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters passivated by hydrogen ,",
    "the dominating factor is again the lattice mismatch .",
    "this similar effect is observed from the homo - lumo gap as shown in fig .",
    "the existence of such large energy gap for si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters of this size ( with @xmath2 ) can be attributed to the effect of quantum confinement and is consistent with the scenario of a blueshift in pl .",
    "it is well known that an accurate calculation of the band gap is important for the determination of the optical polarizability of semiconductors and insulators .",
    "many efforts have been focused on the correction to the `` too - small '' band gap obtained by dft / lda calculations for the purpose of accurately predicting the optical response of these systems .",
    "another key factor for determining the optical properties of these systems is a proper description of interacting electron - hole pairs ( excitons ) .",
    "while calculations using the green s function based on the gw approach have led to quite accurate prediction of the energy of low - lying excitations and the oscillator strength for small clusters @xcite , the application of this method to clusters of intermediate sizes is still computationally too expensive .",
    "most recently , a method based on the linear - response theory within the frame work of the time - dependent ( td ) dft / lda had been applied to calculate the optical spectra of clusters @xcite with results in general agreement with experimental results as well as more complicated theoretical methods ( e.g. , gw approach ) . however , at present , the application of the method is still limited to clusters of radius less than 1 @xmath27 .",
    "the study of the dielectric function via the optical transition matrix elements allows us to obtain information directly on absorption and photoluminescence spectra .",
    "it can also allow us to obtain information indirectly on the relevant radiative pl processes .",
    "the imaginary part of the dielectric function can be calculated by @xcite    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the polarization vector of the light , @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 refers to the ground state , @xmath32 the excited state , and @xmath33 the excitation angular frequency .",
    "the excited state can be expanded in electron - hole pair configuration such that    @xmath34    the coupling coefficient @xmath35 can be calculated within the framework of the two - particle green s function by solving the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "a reasonable approximation leads to the determination of @xmath36 as the positive solutions to the eigenvalue equation @xcite .    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the single - electron energy in the conduction band , @xmath39 the single - electron energy in the valence band , and @xmath40 the electron - hole interaction kernel .",
    "the most computationally intensive part in the calculation is the evaluation of the electron - hole interaction kernel @xmath40 .",
    "this bottleneck is one of the main culprits that limits the application of the gw approach to only very small clusters and that of the tdlad to clusters with the radius less than 1 @xmath27 .    using eq .",

    "the changing composition is expected to affect more on the transition matrix elements @xmath42 than on the coupling coefficient @xmath35 because of the insensitivity of the edoss to the change in configuration ( see eq .",

    "to set up a benchmark for the analysis of the trend of the the optical features of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters of a given size but varying compositions within the framework considered in this work , we have calculated the imaginary part of the dielectric function without the electron - hole interaction .",

    "the spectral peaks of hydrogenated si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters are sharp with no tail at the edge of the optical spectra .",

    "the large optical gaps in si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters indicate the possibility of optical applications .",
    "since the luminescence is a result of significant overlap in electron and hole wave functions , and the strength of the luminescence depends on the extent of this overlap and the transition probability , we investigated the radiative transition probabilities of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 and si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters .",

    ", the dependence of the dipole matrix element on @xmath12 shows a more complicated pattern ( see table ii ) .",
    "for example , @xmath82 for si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath10 clusters shows a dramatic increase of two orders of magnitude once ge atoms are incorporated into the si cluster .",
    "it peaks at the equal composition of si and ge atoms , and then reduces to a smaller but same order of magnitude for the pure ge cluster .",
    "since the range of variation for @xmath83 ( over two orders of magnitude ) far surpasses that for @xmath70 ( less than one order of magnitude ) , it must be the behavior of @xmath83 that determines the pattern of behavior for @xmath62 .",

    "once ge atoms are incorporated into the hydrogen - passivated si clusters , we express the dipole matrix element in terms of the pseudo - atomic orbitals within the fireball scheme @xcite , namely ,    @xmath85    where @xmath86 denotes the coefficient of expansion of the wave function @xmath87 in the pseudo - atomic orbital @xmath88 at the site @xmath89 .",

    "however , there is a striking difference between the patterns exhibited by the lumo states of the two clusters . in the case of the pure si cluster , the expansion coefficients of the @xmath98-orbital",
    "give the major contribution to the lumo states .",
    "on the other hand , two outstanding features differentiate the pattern of the lumo state of the pure ge cluster from that of the pure si cluster : ( 1 ) the expansion coefficients of the @xmath99-orbital give the major contribution to the lumo state .",
    "( 2 ) the magnitude of the coefficients of the @xmath99-orbital is greater than those of the @xmath98-orbital for the pure si cluster by a factor of 2 to 3 .",
    "an examination of other figures in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that the lumo state possesses the same two features as long as the cluster has a ge content and these features appear mostly at the ge sites .",
    "the overlap between a @xmath99-orbital and neighboring orbitals is far less restrictive as compared to that between a @xmath100 orbital with its neighboring orbitals .",
    "this fact , together with the more pronounced strength of the coefficients for the @xmath99-orbital in the lumo state of ge - containing clusters , leads to a stronger overlap between the lumo and homo states of ge - containing clusters , thus explaining the correlation between the appearance of these two features and the sudden and dramatic increase in the value of @xmath83 once ge atoms are incorporated into the hydrogen - passivated si clusters .",
    "this correlation also indicates that these two features are mainly responsible for the sudden and dramatic increase in @xmath62 once the hydrogen - passivated si cluster possesses a ge content .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the properties of the homo state are closely related to the effective mass of heavy holes while those of the lumo state to the average effective mass of electrons .",
    "the mass of the heavy hole for bulk si is reasonably close to that for bulk ge . on the other hand ,",
    "the average effective mass of electrons for bulk ge is a factor of 2 smaller than that for bulk si .",
    "it is therefore tempting to speculate that the behavior patterns of homo and lumo states are related to the sameness of the mass of heavy hole and the difference in the effective mass of electron for si and ge , respectively .",
    "one may also add that the fact that the effective mass of ge is two times smaller than that of si could be the contributing factor for the dominant contribution of the @xmath99-orbital in the lumo state for clusters with a ge content .",
    "the findings of our systematic study of the structural , electronic , and optical properties of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 cluster with / without hydrogen passivation include : ( 1 ) there is only a weak surface distortion in hydrogen - passivated clusters si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath25 of intermediate sizes .",
    "the mismatch effect is then the dominating factor in determining properties of those clusters .",
    "( 2 ) the homo - lumo gap for si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath25 clusters of intermediate sizes opens up to several evs , consistent with a blueshift in pl .",
    "it shows a linear dependence on the ratio @xmath101 ( @xmath102 constant ) similar to the pattern exhibited by si@xmath4ge@xmath5 alloys @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the homo - lumo spontaneous emission probability @xmath62 of si@xmath0ge@xmath1h@xmath25 clusters is very sensitive to the ge content in the cluster .",
    "once ge atoms are incorporated into the cluster , it can bring about a two - order of magnitude increase in @xmath62 .",
    "our analysis attributes this dramatic increase to the strong overlap between homo and lumo states around ge atoms .",
    "our findings therefore suggest that hydrogen - passivated si@xmath0ge@xmath1 clusters may be a viable candidate as components in optical devices .",
