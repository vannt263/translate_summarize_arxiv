    "in the framework of higher dimensional complex algebraic geometry , rational homogeneous manifolds constitute one of the most important classes of examples of fano manifolds .",
    "their geometric properties may be written in the language of representation theory of complex reductive lie groups , which makes this class one of the best understood .",
    "one of the most important questions in this context was inspired by mori and posed by campana and peternell : can rational homogeneity be described , within the class of fano varieties , in terms of positivity properties of the tangent bundle ?",
    "namely , does the nefness of @xmath0 imply that a fano manifold @xmath1 is homogeneous ?",
    "the strategy towards a solution of the campana - peternell problem that we have been considering recently ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) is based on reconstructing the rational homogeneous structure upon families of minimal rational curves contained in the manifold @xmath1 .",
    "philosophically speaking , rational curves on fano manifolds play a role as central as the one of @xmath2 in the representation theory of reductive groups , and this analogy should become obvious in our candidates to be rational homogeneous manifolds .",
    "one of the fundamental problems in this approach is to understand how nefness is reflected on properties of certain families of rational curves in @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , one may pose the following question , which is still unanswered , to our best knowledge :    [ quest : uniform ] let @xmath3 be a locally unsplit dominating family of rational curves on a fano manifold @xmath1 with nef tangent bundle .",
    "is @xmath3 uniform or , at least , locally uniform ? ( see definition [ def : uniform ] ) .    associated with @xmath3 one may consider the family of minimal sections of the grothendieck projectivization of the tangent bundle @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath4 , over curves of the family @xmath3 ( see definition [ def : minsec2 ] ) , that we denote by @xmath5 , and study the different splitting types of the tangent bundle of @xmath4 with respect to curves of @xmath6",
    ". looking at the rational homogeneous examples , one may check that the family @xmath6 is , in general , not uniform , and the different splitting types are related to the singular locus stratification of the crepant contraction of @xmath4 associated with the line bundle @xmath7 note that it is not yet clear whether the nefness assumption on the tangent bundle of a fano manifold implies its semiampleness .",
    "this singular locus stratification is related , for a rational homogeneous manifold , to the orbit decomposition of the corresponding lie algebra @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , the image of every stratum into @xmath9 is the closure of ( the set of classes modulo homotheties of ) a nilpotent orbit ( see @xcite for an account on these orbits ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the simplest case , in which the families @xmath3 and @xmath6 are both uniform ( we simply say that @xmath3 is @xmath10-uniform , see definition [ def:2-uniform ] ) .",
    "the main result shows that , up to a technical assumption , this property is only fulfilled by rational homogenous manifolds :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath1 be a fano manifold of picard number one supporting an unsplit @xmath10-uniform dominating family @xmath3 of rational curves .",
    "assume moreover that the anticanonical degree @xmath11 of the family is smaller than or equal to @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a semisimple lie group with dynkin diagram @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the parabolic subgroup associated to the @xmath17-th node of the diagram , and the pair @xmath18 is one of the following : @xmath19    in the above statement the cited rational homogeneous manifolds are described in terms of their marked dynkin diagrams ( where the nodes have been numbered as in @xcite ) .",
    "note that the number @xmath20 equals the dimension of the _ variety of minimal rational tangents of @xmath3 at @xmath21 _ , denoted by @xmath22 . in the range @xmath23",
    "one could expect , via a positive answer to hartshorne s conjecture in our particular situation , that @xmath24 is a complete intersection in @xmath25 .",
    "if this is case , we may conclude the following :    [ cor : main ] let @xmath1 be a fano manifold of picard number one , not isomorphic to a projective space , supporting an unsplit @xmath10-uniform dominating family @xmath3 of rational curves , and assume that , for the general point @xmath21 , @xmath24 is a complete intersection .",
    "then @xmath1 is isomorphic to a smooth quadric .    putting this back into the context of the campana  peternell conjecture and question [ quest : uniform ] ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath1 is a manifold of picard number one such that @xmath0 is nef and big , and let @xmath26 be the birational crepant contraction of @xmath4 associated to @xmath7 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that if the restriction of @xmath26 to @xmath27 has @xmath28-dimensional fibers , then necessarily @xmath1 is a smooth hyperquadric .",
    "our main result in this paper implies the following extension of @xcite :    [ cor : e - ample ] let @xmath1 be a fano manifold of picard number one , with nef and big tangent bundle , and assume that , with the same notation as above , the restriction of @xmath26 to @xmath27 is a smooth morphism .",
    "assume moreover that @xmath1 supports an unsplit uniform dominating family of rational curves of anticanonical degree smaller than or equal to @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath1 is rational homogeneous .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : sections [ sec : nodal ] and [ sec : ratcurves ] contain some preliminary material on dual varieties and rational curves on projective varieties , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : minsec ] deals with the family of minimal sections of @xmath4 over curves of a family @xmath3 , and the duality relation of its locus with the variety of minimal rational tangents of @xmath3 .",
    "finally section [ sec : proofs ] contains the proofs of the main results of the paper .",
    "we will recall here some standard facts about dual varieties that we will need later on , focusing in the concrete setting we are interested in , that is , in the context of varieties with only _",
    "nodal singularities_. though these results are probably well known , they are usually stated in the context of smooth varieties ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",

    "we will need an extension of this result to mildly singular varieties , a topic that may be understood in the context of the theory of discriminant varieties of linear systems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
