    "interaction of three - level atoms with a radiation has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "it is believed that an atomic coherence is found to be responsible for various important quantum features of the emitted light . in general ,",
    "the atomic coherence can be induced in a three - level atom by coupling the levels between which a direct transition is dipole forbidden by an external radiation @xcite or by preparing the atom initially in a coherent superposition of these two levels @xcite .",
    "it is found that the cavity radiation exhibits squeezing under certain conditions for both cases @xcite .    in a cascade three - level atom the top , intermediate , and bottom levels",
    "are conveniently denoted by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 in which a direct transition between levels @xmath0 and @xmath2 is dipole forbidden .",
    "when the three - level cascade atom decays from @xmath0 to @xmath2 via the level @xmath1 two photons are generated .",
    "if the two photons have identical frequency , then the three - level atom is referred to as a degenerate .",
    "hence we define a degenerate three - level laser as a quantum optical system in which degenerate three - level atoms in a cascade configuration and initially prepared in a coherent superposition of the top and bottom levels are injected at a constant rate into a cavity .",
    "these atoms are removed from the cavity after some time .",
    "we hence realize that , a degenerate three - level laser is a two photon device in which squeezing properties are expected to occur due to the correlation between these two photons @xcite .",
    "we consider a degenerate three - level cascade laser coupled to a vacuum reservoir via a single - port mirror and the bottom level of the atoms on the other hand is coupled to the top level by an external resonant coherent light as shown in fig .",
    "some authors have already studied such a scheme in which the atomic coherence is induced by an external radiation and when initially the atoms are prepared in the top level @xcite and bottom level @xcite .",
    "they found that the three - level laser in these cases resemble the parametric oscillator for a strong radiation .",
    "moreover , recently saavedra itet al .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath3 three - level laser when the atoms are initially prepared in a coherent superposition and the forbidden transition is induced by driving with strong external radiation .",
    "they found that there is lasing without population inversion with the favorable noise reduction occurs for equal population of the two levels and when the initial coherence is maximum .",
    "therefore , we consider the case when the atoms are initially prepared to be in an arbitrary atomic superposition and in addition driven on resonance externally by a coherent radiation .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the regime of lasing without population inversion .",
    "in this communication , we study the squeezing properties of the cavity radiation and we also calculate the mean photon number using the stochastic differential equation associated with the normal ordering .",
    "we prefer to employ the classical stochastic relations to the corresponding quantum operator for obvious reason that it is mathematically easier to deal with .",
    "in particular , we calculate the quadrature variance and the mean photon number for cases when the atoms are initially prepared to be in the bottom level and when they are having equal probability of being in the top and bottom levels .",
