    "the search for an understanding of an energy source great enough to explain the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) phenomena has attracted much attention from the astrophysical community since its discovery .",
    "one of the more recent candidates for the grb model is based on the fire - ball model.@xcite the proposal for the central engine for such bursts concerns @xmath3 production and their subsequent scattering in the environs of a dense accretion disk / low - mass black hole system @xcite .",
    "such a system may be formed by the merger of a black hole and a neutron star , the merger of two neutron stars , by a collapsar , or by a supernova @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical details of the geometry or environment of such systems are currently hidden from us both observationally and computationally , although this situation may change in the near future with the development of gravity wave observatories and more sophisticated general relativistic astrophysical simulation capabilities . for the mean time in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on a rather simplified model for the scattering of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the vicinity of a low - mass rotating black hole .",
    "our goal is to extend the recent work of asano & fukuyama ( af ) @xcite and salmonson and wilson @xcite ( sw ) by providing the first general - relativistically covariant off - axis calculation of the energy momentum deposition rate ( mdr ) .",
    "we focus our attention , as did the previous authors , on the general relativistic enhancement or degradation of the deposited mdr .    since we now intend to calculate the off - axis contributions , the direction of the energy - momentum 4-vector",
    "can no longer be assumed , as opposed to the along axis case , where symmetry forces the net energy upward along the symmetry axis .",
    "an accurate treatment of off - axis contributions requires a full 4-dimensional spacetime calculation , as opposed to the analytic and semi - analytic calculations performed by af and sw .",
    "therefore , we derive the full energy - momentum ( hereafter referred to as `` momenergy'')@xcite deposited in the vicinity of the black hole / accretion disk system . the calculations are based on the basic principles as discussed in misner , thorne and wheeler.@xcite we consider the direction of the momenergy in the frame of an observer at a given point above the disk .",
    "our aim in this work is not solely to study and draw conclusions on the relativistic case of neutrino and anti - neutrino collisions above the accretion disk for grb models , but also to develop a method to provide a more in - depth understanding of the scattering mechanisms in the environs of small accreting black hole systems . for the above purpose",

    "however , the temperature characterizing our observer s spectrum is scaled by the frequency shift of the neutrinos . @xmath78 following the derivation of salmonson and wilson@xcite , the mdr integral ( eq.[mdr1 ] ) can be transformed into a 4-dimensional integral by analytically integrating over @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "@xmath92    in order to calculate the generation of 4-momentum from the @xmath4@xmath93 scattering , we must first image the accretion disk in the observer s reference frame .",

    "the image of the disk is color coded as to the energy of the neutrinos reaching the observer .",

    "up to this point we have calculated the total momenergy density created in a given observer s orthonormal frame per unit 3-volume per unit proper time .",
    "these results are posed properly in general relativity as they represent a meaningful local observation .",
    "however , for the grb application we address in this paper it would be useful to determine the electron distribution function for an observer at large radii ( e.g. @xmath112 ) from the accretion disk .",
    "this location would approach the inner envelope of a hypothetical stellar shell surrounding the black - hole / accretion disk system .",
    "at such a location we could construct a source term for the fluid at the inner envelope of the star that would provide the energy for a jet which would ultimately punch through the outer atmosphere of the star  a jet that would be the generator of a fireball - type solution .",
    "unfortunately , the construction of such a source is a computationally difficult problem even under the ideal assumptions that the electrons created evolve as a collisionless fluid and are highly energetic ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "if we want to know how many electrons with momentum @xmath114 arrive at an observer located at spacetime event @xmath115 , then we would need to construct the geodesic into the past tangent to @xmath114 at @xmath115 and sum up the electron creation functions along and tangent to that geodesic.@xcite this would require modifying the calculation of the mdr ( eq .  [ mdr ] ) to calculate the probability distribution functions for the creation of electrons at each point . we would then need to construct and store these electron creation functions on a dense grid in the @xmath116-@xmath115 plane perpendicular to the disk and integrate these creation distribution functions over the 3-parameter ( 2 sky angles and electron energy defining @xmath114 ) family of geodesics of the observer at @xmath115 . alternatively , we could solve a 3-dimensional collisionless boltzmann equation for the kerr spacetime geometry.@xcite unfortunately , both of these approaches , while correct in a gr sense , are computationally demanding in the extreme . while there is no technical reason that would prevent us from carrying out these calculations ,",
    "practical considerations prevent us from completing them in the near future .",
    "consequently , we elect to pursue a simpler computational strategy for the estimation of the grb jet source term .    the difficulties with a general covariant treatment originate with the kerr black hole and not with the schwarzschild solutions . in particular , we currently calculate the total 4-momentum deposited per unit 4-volume in the observer s orthonormal frame .",
    "any attempt to assign a 4-volume to the observer in bl coordinates ( or any coordinate ) would break general covariance .",
    "in other words , the spatial slices of the bl metric are not orthogonal to the time lines ( @xmath117 ) , and thus the 3-space of our observers is not integrable .",
    "nevertheless , if we take the total mdr calculated in the last section and transform this to the bl coordinates and multiply by the `` effective bl spatial 3-volume '' of our observer , we can obtain an approximation to a 4-momentum per proper time of electrons created at that location .",
    "this is a coordinate - dependent quantity which should be adequate for a qualitative understanding as long as the observers are not too close the the horizon of a rotating black hole .",
    "moreover , electron - positron production close to the horizon should not be expected to contribute significantly to the results at large radii , as the electron - positron production for observers close to the horizon will be dominated by in - scatter of the electrons and positrons into the black hole . given",
    "coordinate dependent mdr quantities , we then parallel transport each of these 4-dimensional momenergy vectors parallel to themselves out to the inner shell of the collapsar ( say at @xmath112 ) .",
    "we then determine the time dilation and bin the results as a function of the poloidal angle . in this way we can estimate the mdr from neutrino scattering as a function of the angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "this treatment is obviously non - covariant .",
    "however , as the astrophysical uncertainties of the environs of such a black hole / accretion disk system appear to be , at present , far greater than the issues with relativity we raise here ; we feel that our violation of general covariance to simplify the computational requirements may be justified in order to provide at least a qualitative understanding of the off - axis energy - deposition at the inner envelope .",
    "we acknowledge that for a more complete characterization of the source term , a covariant treatment should ultimately be undertaken . in the meantime",
    ", we feel that the results presented herein provide a useful qualitative estimate .",
    "we have provided a pictorial representation of the total mdr calculated for a field of observers in the @xmath116-@xmath115 plane perpendicular to the accretion disk in fig  [ pictures ] .",
    "here we have placed @xmath118 observers in this plane and calculated the mdr for each using eq .",
    "( [ mdr2 ] ) .",
    "the observers were evenly spaced in 100 equal bl increments ( @xmath119 ) in radius from @xmath120 out to @xmath121 , and equally spaced in 100 bl poloidal increments ( @xmath122 ) from @xmath123 to @xmath124 .",
    "the mdr densities were transformed to bl coordinates .",
    "the 3-volume assigned to each observer is , as mentioned above , coordinate dependent ( @xmath125 ) the last column of the figure illustrates the structure of the mdr generated above the surface of the accretion disk .    in fig .",
    "[ angprofiles ] we integrated the bl mdr 4-momentum out along their geodesics until they either hit the black hole or they reach @xmath112 .",
    "we do this for five black hole / disk systems .",
    "the five systems correspond to specific angular momentums with the values , @xmath126 . for each value of @xmath2",
    "the bl time component of the mdr in the bl frame reaching @xmath112 was binned into 20 bins ranging from @xmath123 to @xmath124 .",
    "the relative magnitude of these curves increase with increasing values of the specific angular momentum of the central black hole .",
    "we have investigated the origin of this increase and find that the source of the increase is the region of the accretion disk near the inner - most stable orbit .",
    "this is illustrated in ( fig .",
    "[ erd_on_a ] ) where we compare the angular mdr profile for an accretion disk extending from @xmath127 out to @xmath128 with ( 1 ) a schwarzschild black hole and ( 2 ) and extreme kerr black hole .",
    "the magnitudes are approximately equal and only a slight tightening of the angle of the peak mdr is apparent for the extreme kerr black hole system .    we demonstrate convergence of our results with regard to the number of observers we use in the @xmath116-@xmath115 plane by comparison of a high and lower resolution run ( fig .",
    "[ highlow ] ) . the higher resolution , which we use in our calculations in this manuscript , is a little smoother than the lower resolution run ; however , the both compare well with each other .    the relevant quantity reported by af was the total mdr at a distant observer . if we integrate each of the five mdr curves shown in fig .",
    "[ angprofiles ] over @xmath129 at @xmath112 we will obtain the integrated mdr into the jet as shown in fig .  [ totaledr(a ) ] .",
    "it will be concentrated along the axis and peak along a cone of opening angle @xmath1 .",
    "this opening angle is due to the tilt of the mdr near the surface of the disk .",
    "the tilt is in the direction of the disk s rotation .",
    "we find a linear dependence for this integrated mdr as a function of the specific angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "this is an extension of the earlier results because we are including the relatively large off - axis source term  the mdr created just above the surface of the disk via @xmath4 @xmath130 scattering .",
    "this disk mdr produces a 10 to 20 fold enhancement to the total mdr energy deposited at @xmath112 over and above the on - axis mdr , even for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "such a disk - generated mdr was also found in the non - gravitational models of af.@xcite the dependence of this disk - driven source of momenergy on the specific angular momentum of the black hole is roughly linear .",
    "we predict a twofold increase in the mdr for an extreme kerr black hole relative to a schwarzschild hole .",
    "in addition , in ( fig .",
    "[ angprofiles ] ) we only see a slight tightening of the cone of the momenergy deposition with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "it would be interesting to observe the jet dynamics through the outer envelope of the star with sources of this kind .",
    "the goal of the research in the grb central engine modeling community over the last few years was to look for a needed enhancement of a factor of 10 in the mdr .",
    "previous work by af and sw looked for such an enhancement over the non - gravitating models by examining the gr effects on neutrino pair scattering along the symmetry axis .",
    "they did not find this enhancement ; however , in this paper we identify the off - axis disk - driven mdr component that yields such an increase over corresponding on - axis mdr values .",
    "furthermore , this disk - driven momenergy occurs in the non - rotating black holes as well as the rotating black holes , and is even present in the non - physical models with no gravity effects ( e.g. fig 4 of ref .",
    "we therefore have strong indication that the the current fireball central engine model discussed here is viable .",
    "of course , more detailed astrophysical simulations are needed which include the complex environs of the black hole disk system , geometry and transient behavior of the disk and black hole , and a simulation of the induced plasma transport of the scattering out to the fireball region . since this disk - driven mdr source is relatively large , and",
    "since the baryon pollution problem@xcite remains an open issue in this field,@xcite we argue that it may be premature to discount this off - axis source .",
    "we should reserve such a decision until more detailed gr , hydrodynamic , mhd and plasma transport calculations have been done .    as we outlined in the paper , we have extended the earlier work of af to calculate the off - axis contribution to the mdr . when using the assumptions made by these authors , our results are consistent their work ; however , we find the generation of a substantial mdr above the disk , which , when added to the on - axis calculations of these authors produce a substantial enhancement to the deposition of energy - momentum .",
    "in particular , we find an approximately linear dependence of the total mdr at large @xmath131 as a function of specific angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "@xmath132 here we did a least - squares fit to the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ totaledr(a ) ] , multiplied by @xmath91 times the cube of the solar mass ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the bulk of the mdr at large @xmath131 is deposited in a conic region centered on the symmetry axis of the system with an opening angle of approximately @xmath1 .",
    "although we provide a rigorous general relativistic calculation of the mdr at an arbitrary observer , computational constraints required us to make some approximations regarding the transport of the scattered energy out to the inner envelope ( @xmath112 ) of the star . assuming ( 1 ) the electrons produced have substantially higher energy than their rest mass , ( 2 ) that the electrons propagate away in a collisionless fashion and ( 3 ) that the observationally - relevant electron creation distribution functions are peaked around the total mdr calculated , then our results should be rigorously correct for a schwarzschild black hole , and qualitatively correct for spinning black holes .",
    "we would not be surprised if a general - relativistically rigorous calculations would yield different quantitative results for the extreme kerr black hole close to the horizon . however , one of the main results of this paper is the identification of the off - axis disk - driven mdr as providing an enhancement to the energy deposition rate rather than the gr - driven enhancements .",
    "we outlined in the last section an approach to calculate the electron distribution function at an observer @xmath134 at large @xmath131 in a relativistically covariant way .",
    "this involved integrating the electron - creation distribution functions along geodesics into the past which originated at @xmath134 .",
    "one step in this direction would be to extend the work here and calculate the electron creation distributions in the frame of our observers as opposed to the total mdr .",
    "this is not difficult in principle but is computationally demanding as it would require evaluating a 6-dimensional scattering integral as opposed to the 4-dimensional integral we evaluated numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , eqn .",
    "the utility of such a calculation would be to evaluate the point along the axis on the border between out - scatter and in - scatter ( i.e. when the total mdr was zero ) .",
    "would the electron creation function at and about this event yield a non - negligible contribution to the electron distribution function at large @xmath131 ?    on a more speculative note ,",
    "we also are interested in calculating secondary scattering of the electrons and positrons within the ergosphere of the black hole .",
    "we have found evidence of significant in - scatter into this region .",
    "will the penrose process produce some observable high energy events from this region that can give us more clues to the inner workings of the central engine of these low mass black hole / accretion disk systems ?",
    "one question seems of paramount importance in this field : _ what observational features of a grb can give clues as to the inner - workings of the central engine?_@xcite surely future x - ray , @xmath135-ray and gravity wave observatories complemented with theory can soon unveil these cosmic explosions .",
