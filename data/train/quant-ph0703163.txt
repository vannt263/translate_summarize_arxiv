    "in part  i of this series of papers we have discussed how time asymmetry arose in quantum mechanics . here",
    "we explain the meaning of the time of preparation of a quantum state .",
    "in the present paper we describe an experiment which verifies our concept .",
    "it is based on the idea of quantum jumps for a single ion .    in essentially",
    "all discussions of the foundation of quantum theory , one distinguishes between _ states _ and _ observables_. states , described by a state vector @xmath0 ( or a density operator @xmath1 ) fulfill the schrdinger equation @xmath2 the state represents the preparation apparatus of an experiment .",
    "observables , described by operators @xmath3 or projection operators @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) or , in the simplest case , by one - dimensional projections @xmath6 , or vectors ( up to a phase factor ) @xmath7 , fulfill the heisenberg equation    [ he ] @xmath8 @xmath9\\,,\\ ] ]    where for an operator @xmath10 , is the more familiar form of this dynamical equation .",
    "the observable represents the registration apparatus ( detector ) of an experiment .",
    "the experimental quantities are the probabilities @xmath11 of the observable @xmath12 in the state @xmath1 .",
    "theoretically , @xmath13 are calculated as the born probabilities @xmath14 which for the special case of an observable @xmath15 in a pure state @xmath16 is given by @xmath17{c }      |{\\langle}\\psi^-(t)|\\phi^+{\\rangle}|^2\\\\ \\text{heisenberg picture}\\end{array } =    \\begin{array}[t]{c } |{\\langle}\\psi^-|\\phi^+(t){\\rangle}|^2\\\\ \\text{schrodinger        picture}\\end{array}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] experimentally the probabilities @xmath13 are measured as ratios of large detector counts , e.g. , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of detector count at time @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the total number of counts .",
    "the solutions of the dynamical differential equations like and have to be found under _",
    "boundary conditions_. for standard quantum mechanics , the boundary condition is given by the hilbert space axiom :    the solutions of of are elements of the ( norm - complete ) hilbert space @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 ( this means the energy wavefunctions @xmath24 , @xmath25 , must be _ lebesgues _ square integrable . )    in paper i @xcite , it was argued that under the standard axiom one could not have a consistent theory of resonance and decay phenomena : if one wants to include states for which the approximate lifetime - width relation of the weisskopf - wigner methods , @xmath26 of @xcite , becomes an exact equality , @xmath27 , in particular if one wants to have gamow vectors @xmath28 with exponential time evolution , then one can not sustain the standard axiom .",
    "therefore , we chose a new boundary condition for the old dynamical equations , , the _ hardy space axiom _ : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the two different hardy spaces of the same hilbert space @xmath22 , corresponding to the complex energy semiplanes @xmath31 .",
    "this means the energy wavefunctions @xmath32 of out - observables must be smooth functions that can be analytically continued into the upper complex energy plane @xmath33 , and the wavefunctions @xmath25 of the in - state must be smooth functions that can be analytically continued into the lower complex energy plane @xmath34 .",
    "since the in - states are defined by the preparation apparatus ( e.g. , accelerator ) and the out - observables are defined by the registration apparatus ( e.g. , detector ) of an experiment on micro - systems , there is no need to identify @xmath35 and use the standard axiom which in the mathematical description identifies states and observables with the hilbert space .",
    "a consequence of the new hardy space axiom is the time asymmetry @xmath36 of the dynamical evolution given by the semigroup solutions @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xcite . in particular",
    "the gamow state @xmath39 fulfilling @xmath40 , evolves in time according to @xmath37 of @xcite as @xmath41 and exists only for @xmath42 .    since from the hilbert space solution of the dynamical equations , , we are used to time symmetric solutions , @xmath43 , such a time asymmetry may appear surprising .",
    "but , from other areas of physics , we are quite familiar with time - asymmetric solutions of time symmetric dynamical equations due to time - asymmetric boundary conditions , e.g. , the retarded and the advanced solutions of electrodynamics . the maxwell equations , like the equations and , are symmetrical in time .",
    "the additional axiom which chooses the retarded potential over the advanced potential is called the `` radiation arrow of time '' ; it is formulated as a boundary condition for the maxwell equations , which excludes the strictly incoming field in every space - time region ( sommerfeld radiation condition ) .",
    "all fields possess advanced sources : radiation must be emitted first by a source before it can be detected by a receiver .",
    "a similar `` arrow of time '' exist for quantum physics : a state must be prepared first by a preparation apparatus at @xmath44 before at a later time @xmath45 an observable can be measured or registered by a registration apparatus . in order to formulate this quantum mechanical arrow of time",
    "we speak of states and observables , and we make a distinction between the states @xmath46 and the observables @xmath47 . in quantum mechanics in general one always",
    "_ speaks _ of states and observables , but then using the standard axiom one identifies them in the mathematical description .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , if we want to derive for the pole term of the @xmath48-matrix element @xmath49 in @xmath50 of @xcite , the relation @xmath51 between the lorentzian width @xmath52 and the exponential lifetime @xmath53 , then we are forced to distinguish also mathematically between states and observables and use the new axiom .",
    "this in turn leads to the semigroup evolution which introduces a `` beginning of time '' , the semigroup time @xmath54 .",
    "the question in quantum physics then is : what is the meaning of a `` beginning of time @xmath55 '' ?",
    "how does one observe it and why have we not been more aware of its existence ?",
    "most experiments in quantum physics deal with large ensembles of quantum systems ( elementary particles , or atoms , or ions ) which are prepared at a variety of times .",
    "that means individual atoms of an ensemble are prepared at many different times and there is no way to distinguish which has been prepared at a time , say @xmath56 and which at a time @xmath57 ( by the clocks in the lab ) . if , however , one could work with _ single quantum systems and identify the preparation time of a single quantum system _ , then one could consider the quantum mechanical state , say @xmath39 , whose ensemble is the collections of the single quantum systems prepared at the `` ensemble of times '' @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59    such experiments on the excited states of an individual quantum system have been performed in experiments with single laser cooled @xmath60 ions @xcite , @xmath61 ions @xcite and @xmath62 ions @xcite using dehmelt s idea of shelving the single ion on a metastable level @xcite .",
    "experiments of this kind require an atom with two excited states both of which are radiatively coupled to the same ground state but have vastly different transition rates .",
    "we will discuss here in detail the experiment in @xcite with an @xmath62 ion .    for the @xmath62",

    "what one observes ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xcite ) is a sudden onset of periods of no fluorescence at a time @xmath56 and a sudden return of the original fluorescence intensity at a later time @xmath100 .",
    "these onsets of dark periods followed by the return of the fluorescence repeat themselves ( about @xmath101 times in the experiment @xcite ) : at @xmath102 one sees sudden jumps of the fluorescence intensity to @xmath103 , followed by a sudden return of the fluorescence radiation at the later times @xmath104 .",
    "the only reasonable interpretation of this is that during the dark periods the single @xmath62 ion is shelved on the level @xmath105 .",
    "while @xmath62 is `` shelved '' on the metastable level @xmath64 , it can not participate in the fluorescence transitions @xmath106 and one obtains dark periods ( `` shelf level dwell period '' ) of various durations @xmath107 two of these dark periods for the fluorescence transition are shown in fig .",
    "a dark period means that the system is on the metastable level @xmath64 , which is described by @xmath108 an individual @xmath64 is prepared , it `` lives '' for the duration @xmath98 and decays at the time @xmath109 .",
    "the state vector @xmath28 for the meta - stable @xmath105-state therefore represents an ensemble of individual @xmath64-levels of @xmath62 ; the @xmath110-th member of this ensemble is created ( or prepared ) at a definite time @xmath111 which is the time @xmath112 in the life of this @xmath110-th member .",
    "this is also the time @xmath112 of the state @xmath28 .    a quantum mechanical state vector @xmath0 , or @xmath39 , or state operator @xmath1 , represents an ensemble ( a large number ) of individual micro - systems .",
    "usually one thinks of an ensemble of microsystems as of collections of many particles that are present at one particular point of time ( in our live , or by the laboratory clocks ) ; in this experiment one has one single ion in the @xmath64 level at a collection of many preparation times @xmath113 .",

    "since the lifetime @xmath63 is @xmath117 , and the lifetime of @xmath105 is @xmath118 , the onset time of the dark periods @xmath111 are determined with very high accuracy .",
    "the same applies to the time @xmath109 , since one observes a _ sudden _ return of fluorescence .",
    "this is the time at which the @xmath110-th @xmath105-level has decayed into @xmath119 , and the processes can resume .",
    "the duration of a dark period @xmath120 is thus the individual lifetime of the @xmath110-th @xmath64 level , and it is defined to very high accuracy .",
    "two of these individual lifetimes @xmath98 of the @xmath64 levels are shown by the duration of the dark periods in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the interpretation of our observation is the following : since the single @xmath62 can either make the fluorescence monitored transitions or be in the quasistable state @xmath121 the time interval @xmath120 is the time which the @xmath110-th single @xmath62 at the @xmath105 level of @xmath62 has `` lived '' , from its preparation at @xmath111 to its decay into @xmath119 at @xmath109 .",
    "the ensemble of the @xmath105 levels is described by the state vector @xmath28 .",
    "the preparation time @xmath55 of the state @xmath28 is the ensemble of times @xmath113 , @xmath122 this time @xmath123 is the time zero in the existence of each individual @xmath105-@xmath62-ion state .",

    "the born probability for the gamow state ( survival probability ) is given by the exponential law @xmath127 these probabilities are measured by the counting ratios : in and below indicates that this is an equality between theoretical quantities on the left hand side and experimental quantities on the right hand side ( which would become an exact equality in the unrealistic case of continuously infinite events ) . ]",

    "not the values @xmath98 are characteristic quantities of the gamow state but the weighted average which corresponds to the theoretical lifetime @xmath53 of the gamow state in with @xmath137 .",
    "the lifetime @xmath53 is one of the characteristics of the gamow state @xmath147 of @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the exponential law which follows from .",

    "the time asymmetry of quantum theory which was shown in @xcite to be a byproduct of a unified theory of resonance scattering and decay phenomena , distinguishes a particular time @xmath55 , the time @xmath151 of a semigroup time evolution .",
    "this is the time at which the state ( e.g. , decaying state ) has been prepared and the registration of the observable ( e.g. , decay products ) can begin .",
    "this semigroup @xmath112 is measured as the collection of times @xmath113 at which the individual @xmath64-levels of a single @xmath62 were prepared .",
    "these times of preparation of @xmath64 levels are documented by the sudden onset times @xmath111 of the dark periods for the single @xmath62 ion .",
    "each dark period also has its individual end @xmath109 ( documented by the end of the dark period ) .",
    "thus each dark period has its individual lifetime @xmath152 .",
    "the quantum mechanical state @xmath39 describes the ensemble of individual microsystems created under the same condition at an ensemble of different times @xmath113 .",

    "the state would be asymptotically prepared for @xmath154 as a state of the @xmath155-system and evolve in time through a superpositions of vectors representing @xmath155 , @xmath63 , @xmath156 , @xmath157,@xmath59 . using the hilbert space axiom ,",
    "the probability for @xmath64 would be different from zero  at least infinitesimally  at any time @xmath20 between @xmath158 .",
    "it could be significantly different from zero at a particular time @xmath55 , but there could not be sudden jumps as used for the interpretation of the sudden onset of dark periods at @xmath111 .",
    "on the other hand the existence of these quantum jumps is an experimental confirmation of the semigroup time evolution .",
    "the new hardy space hypothesis which was conjectured in order to obtain a consistent theory that unifies breit - wigner resonances and exponentially decaying gamow states also led to a semigroup evolution @xcite and therewith the semigroup time @xmath54 .",
