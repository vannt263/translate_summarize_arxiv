    "the name `` quantum graph '' is usually used for a pair @xmath10 , where @xmath1 is a network - shaped structure of vertices connected by edges ( `` metric graph '' ) and @xmath11 is a second order self - adjoint differential operator ( `` hamiltonian '' ) , which is determined by differential operations on the edges and certain interface conditions at the vertices .",
    "quantum graphs arise naturally in mathematics , physics , chemistry and engineering as models of wave propagation in quasi - one - dimensional systems looking like a narrow neighbourhood of a graph .",
    "one can mention , in particular , quantum wires , photonic crystals , dynamical systems , scattering theory and many other applications .",
    "we refer to the recent monograph @xcite containing a broad overview and comprehensive bibliography on this topic .    in many applications ( for instance , to graphen and carbon nano - structures  cf .",
    "@xcite ) periodic infinite graphs are studied .",
    "the metric graph @xmath1 is called _ periodic _",
    "( @xmath2-_periodic _ ) if there is a group @xmath12 acting isometrically , properly discontinuously and co - compactly on @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "* definition 4.1.1 . ) ) .",
    "roughly speaking @xmath1 is glued from countably many copies of a certain compact graph @xmath13 (  period cell \" ) and each @xmath14 maps @xmath13 to one of these copies .    in what follows in order to simplify the presentation ( but without any loss of generality ) we will assume that @xmath1 is embedded into @xmath15 with @xmath16 as @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 and is invariant under translations through linearly independent vectors @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 these vectors produce an action of @xmath2 on @xmath1 .",
    "such an embedding can be always realized .",
    "an example of @xmath22-periodic graph is presented on figure [ fig1 ] , its period cell is highlighted in bold lines .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath11 on a periodic metric graph @xmath1 is said to be periodic if it commutes with the action of @xmath2 on @xmath1 .",
    "it is well - known ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) ) that the spectrum of such operators has a band structure , i.e. it is a locally finite union of compact intervals called _ bands_. in general the neighbouring bands may overlap . the bounded open interval @xmath23 is called a _ gap _ if it has an empty intersection with the spectrum , but its ends belong to it . in general the presence of gaps in the spectrum is not guaranteed  for example if @xmath1 is a rectangular lattice and @xmath11 is defined by the operation @xmath24 on its edges and the kirchhoff conditions at the vertices then the spectrum @xmath25 of the operator @xmath11 has no gaps , namely @xmath26 .",
    "existence of spectral gaps is important because of various applications , for example in physics of photonic crystals .",
    "there are several ways how to create quantum waveguides with spectral gaps .",
    "one of them is to use decorating graphs .",
    "namely , given a fixed graph @xmath27 we `` decorate '' it attaching to each vertex of @xmath27 a copy of certain fixed graph @xmath28 , the obtained graph we denote by @xmath1 .",
    "spectral properties of such graphs were studied in @xcite , where operators defined on functions on vertices were considered ( `` discrete graphs '' ) .",
    "the case of quantum graphs was studied in @xcite and it was proved that gaps open up in the spectrum of the operator defined by the operation @xmath24 on the edges of @xmath1 and the kirchhoff conditions at the vertices ( other conditions are also allowed ) ; these gaps are located around eigenvalues of a certain hamiltonian on @xmath28 .    also one can use `` spider decoration '' procedure : in each vertex we disconnect the edges emerging from it and then connect their loose endpoints by a certain additional graph ( `` spider '' ) .",
    "such decorating procedure was probably used for the first time in @xcite , more results on gap opening one can find in @xcite .",
    "another way to create gaps , instead of to perturb a graph geometry , is to substitute the kirchhoff conditions at the vertices by more `` advanced '' ones .",
    "for example , let @xmath1 be a rectangular lattice and @xmath11 be defined by the operation @xmath24 on its edges and @xmath29 conditions at the vertices , i.e. the functions from @xmath30 are continuous at all vertices and the sum of their derivatives is proportional to the value of a function at the vertex with a coupling constant @xmath31 ( the case @xmath32 corresponds to the kirchhoff conditions )",
    ". then ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) the spectrum @xmath25 has infinitely many gaps provided @xmath33 and the lattice - spacing ratio satisfies some additional mild assumptions .",
    "the goal of the current paper is to study spectral properties of some specific class of periodic quantum graphs .",
    "the main peculiarity of these graphs is that their spectral gaps can be nicely controlled via a suitable choice of the graph geometry and of coupling constants involved in interface conditions at its vertices .",
