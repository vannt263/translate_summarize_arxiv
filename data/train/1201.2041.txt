    "non - locality is in the heart of quantum world . from bell",
    "s theorem@xcite , it is understood that no local hidden variable theory could replace quantum theory as a theory of physical world .",
    "the existence of entangled states in composite quantum systems assures the non - local behavior of quantum theory .",
    "generally , violation of bell s inequality is taken as the signature of non - locality .",
    "entangled states play an important role to show the violation of bell s inequality .",
    "however non - locality can be viewed from other perspectives .",
    "for example , there exist sets of locally indistinguishable orthogonal pure product states@xcite , used to show non - locality without entanglement .",
    "recently introduced measurement induced non - locality@xcite ( in short , min ) , is one of the ways to detect non - locality in quantum states by some locally invariant measurements .",
    "locally invariant measurements can not affect global states in classical theory but this is possible in quantum theory .",
    "so min is a type of non - local correlation which can only exists in quantum domain .",
    "min is defined in such a way that it is non - negative for all states , invariant under local unitary and vanishes on product state . in this sense , min could be observed as a type of non - local correlation which is induced by certain measurement . although it is induced by some measurement ,",
    "it is not a measure of quantum correlation in true sense .",
    "but it can be treated as a measure of non - locality induced by some kind of measurement .",
    "now a natural question arises about the shareability of quantum correlations in multipartite states . it may be monogamous or",
    "may be polygamous .",
    "it is known that entanglement is monogamous@xcite . in this work",
    "we will investigate the monogamous behavior of min .",
    "we will check the monogamy property for some classes of states in both three and four - qubit system . unlike discord@xcite",
    ", here we will show that both the three qubit generalized ghz and w states satisfy monogamy relations , however there is violations of monogamy relation if we consider the generic whole class of pure three qubit states . in the case of pure four - qubit system",
    "we consider the most important generic class of states .",
    "it contains usual ghz , maximally entangled states in the sense of gour et.al .",
    "most of the states satisfy monogamy relations .",
    "there are two important subclasses of the generic class , say , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in one subclass monogamy",
    "holds but in another it does not . in particular , ghz state violates monogamy relation and w satisfies it .",
    "therefore , monogamous relations of min are quite different to that of some important measures of correlation@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows - in the section ii we will review some of the basic properties of min . in section iii we will explain and discuss about some four - qubit classes of states which we will require in our work .",
    "section iv is devoted to the notion of monogamy for min .",
    "section v contains results on pure three qubit systems and section vi contains results on four qubit system .",
    "consider @xmath2 be any bipartite state shared between two parties a and b. then min ( denoted by @xmath3 ) is defined by , @xmath4 where maximum is over all von neumann measurements @xmath5 which do not disturb @xmath6 the local density matrix of a , i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is taken as hilbert schmidt norm ( i.e. @xmath9^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] ) .",
    "it is in some sense , dual to that of geometric measure of discord .",
    "physically , min quantifies the global effect caused by locally invariant measurements .",
    "min has application in general dense coding , quantum state steering etc .",
    "min vanishes for product state and remains positive for entangled states . for pure states min reduces to linear entropy like geometric discord@xcite .",
    "explicit formula of min for @xmath10 system , @xmath11 ( if @xmath12 is non - degenerate ) system and an explicit upper bound for @xmath11 system were obtained by luo , fu in @xcite .",
    "later mirafzali _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite formulate a way to reduce the problem of degeneracy in @xmath11 system and evaluate it for @xmath13 dimensional system .",
    "min is invariant under local unitary , i.e. , in true sense , it is a non - local correlation measure .",
    "the set of all zero min states is non - convex .",
    "guo , hou @xcite derived the conditions for the nullity of min .",
    "they have found that set of states with zero min is a proper subset of the set of all classical quantum states , i.e. , zero discord states .",
    "min for classical quantum state vanishes if each eigen - subspace of @xmath12 is one dimensional .",
    "it therefore reveals that non - commutativity is the cause of these kind of non - locality in quantum states .",
    "recently , in @xcite , min have been quantified in terms of relative entropy to give it another physical interpretation .",
    "however , in our work we have used the older definition of min .",
    "suppose @xmath14 , @xmath15 be the hilbert spaces associated with the parties a and b respectively and @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote the hilbert space of linear operators acting on @xmath14 , @xmath15 with the inner product defined by @xmath18 .",
