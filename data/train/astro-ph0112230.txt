    "red giants with luminosities near 10@xmath8 l@xmath6 typically display infrared excesses that are the result of dust formed in a stellar wind reprocessing optical light emitted by the central star ( habing 1996 ) .",
    "the mass loss rates can exceed 10@xmath9 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 and the outflow speed is typically near 15 km s@xmath7 .",
    "these winds are important in stellar evolution because the star may lose over half of its initial main sequence mass during this phase .",
    "a standard model to explain this mass loss is that as the stars pulsate , shock waves form in the atmosphere which drive matter above the nominal photosphere . in the post - shock region ,",
    "the matter cools and grains form . after the dust",
    "is created , radiation pressure then expels the matter into the interstellar medium ( see , for example , lamers & cassinelli 1999 , willson 2000 ) .",
    "although the standard model successfully explains the properties of many red giants winds , there are some systems where it does not apply ( see jura & kahane 1999 ) .",
    "this  standard model \" does not consider the effects of binaries , rotation or magnetic fields .",
    "in a recent set of calculations of models for mass loss from pulsating red giants , winters et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found a class of solutions , that are distinct from the standard model and which the authors denote as  case b \" , where the mass loss rate is less than 3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 at an outflow speed less than 5 km s@xmath7 . in these models , mechanical energy from the pulsations drives the mass loss ; radiation pressure on grains is a relatively minor effect .",
    "these  case b \" models apply to stars of relatively low luminosity , typically where @xmath10 @xmath11 3500 @xmath12 , the pulsational periods are less than 300 days and the effective temperatures of the mass - losing stars are greater than 2600 k.    winters et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were not able to identify any stars which clearly exhibit  b - class \" mass loss .",
    "here , we report detailed mid - infrared observations obtained at the 10 m keck telescope of l@xmath1 pup , a relatively nearby pulsating , mass - losing red giant .",

    "the time - averaged value of ( j - k ) is 1.31 mag ( whitelock et al .",

    "( 2000 ) , the time - averaged effective temperature of l@xmath1 pup is about 3400 k. with these values of the luminosity and temperature , the time - averaged radius of l@xmath1 pup is 7.8 @xmath4 10@xmath17 cm .",
    "since l@xmath1 pup has a velocity relative to the galactic plane of @xmath390 km s@xmath7 ( feast & whitelock 2000 ) , it probably belongs to the thick disk population , and thus the mass of the main sequence progenitor of the star was about 1 m@xmath6 ( jura 1994 ) .",
    "l@xmath1 pup s location on the h - r diagram can be reproduced by interpolating from the lattanzio s ( 1991 ) models for the asymptotic red giant branch evolution of a star with a metallicity that is 0.5 solar . in these calculations ,",
    "the star has a luminosity between 1000 l@xmath6 and 1500 l@xmath6 for about 5 @xmath4 10@xmath18 yr . given its luminosity and effective temperature , it is also possible that l@xmath1 pup is a first ascent red giant ( see the tracks by girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) ; the luminosity and color , do not uniquely indicate the star s evolutionary phase .",
    "the detection of tc would indicate that the star almost certainly lies on the agb ; lebzelter & hron ( 1999 ) report a ",
    "possible \" detection of tc in the atmosphere of l@xmath1 pup .",
    "l@xmath1 pup is a visual binary with a companion which in the year 1913 was at 62 separation ( proust , ochsenbein & pettersen 1981 ) .",
    "however , in the _ hipparcos _ data , this companion now lies at an angular separation of 101 ( dommanget & nys 2000 ) .",
    "this much larger separation in the _ hipparcos _ data implies that the two stars are not a physical pair .",
    "evidence that l@xmath1 pup is losing mass comes from its infrared excess , the detection of circumstellar molecules , and its large , time - varying optical polarization .",
    "the value of f@xmath19(12 @xmath0m)/f@xmath19 2.2 ( @xmath0 m ) is typically near 0.40 to 0.50 , which is much larger than 0.07 , the characteristic photospheric value for this ratio of m giants ( see jura , webb & kahane 2001 ) .",
    "since the circumstellar shell dominates the emission from the system for @xmath20 @xmath21 5 @xmath0 m , the dust shell re - emits approximately 10% of the total stellar luminosity .",
    "detected circumstellar molecules include h@xmath1o , oh , sio and co. the line profiles of these molecules differ from each other because the h@xmath1o , oh , and sio lines are produced as masers while the co is thermally excited . the h@xmath1o profile is variable with a velocity peak at @xmath22 = 38 km s@xmath7 and a second component that shows emission at velocities as low as @xmath22 = 31 km s@xmath7 ( lepine , paes de barros & gammon 1976 , gomez balboa & lepine 1986 ) .",
    "the oh maser emission has been detected at @xmath22 = 33 - 34 km s@xmath7 ( dickinson et al .",
    "the sio maser emission is variable and has been detected at @xmath22 = 43 km s@xmath7 ( balister et al . 1977 ) and as a triple - peaked source with velocities between @xmath22 = 32 km s@xmath7 and 42 km s@xmath7 ( haikala 1990 ) .",
    "the co emission peaks for the different rotational transitions have been reported between @xmath22 = 32.9 km s@xmath7 and 33.7 km s@xmath7 ( kerschbaum et al .",
    "1996 , kerschbaum & olofsson 1999 ) .",
    "the outflow velocity derived from the full extent of the co emission has been measured to be between 2.0 km s@xmath7 and 3.3 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the sio maser emission typically arise within 1 - 2 stellar radii of the photosphere ( see doeleman , lonsdale & greenhill 1998 ) and thus measures the motions induced by the stellar pulsations rather than the gas outflow .",
    "the velocities of the true circumstellar molecules range from 31 km s@xmath7 to 38 km s@xmath7 ; the midpoint of this range of circumstellar gas velocities is 34.5 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the extreme values of the circumstellar gas emission are determined from the h@xmath1o masers , but the co lines are nearly as wide as this spread in the h@xmath1o radial velocities . feast & whitelock report that optical measurements of the star s heliocentric radial velocity yield 53.0 km s@xmath7 which corresponds to @xmath22 = 34.2 km s@xmath7 . within the uncertainties , it appears that the center of mass velocity of l@xmath1 pup is 34.5 km s@xmath7 and that circumstellar molecules move with speeds @xmath13 3.5 km s@xmath7 with respect to this central velocity .",
    "although the outflow is not spherical , we have no information on the spatial variations of the gas outflow speed and we therefore assign an outflow speed of 3.5 km s@xmath7 to the wind . this wind speed is much lower than the typical value of @xmath2110 km s@xmath7 found for most mass - losing red giant stars ( loup et al .",
    "to illustrate the point that l@xmath1 pup has an unusually low wind velocity , we show in figure 1 a histogram of the outflow velocities measured from the line widths of the circumstellar co emission from a survey of semiregular and irregular variables ( kerschbaum & olofsson 1999 ) . in this survey , l@xmath1 pup has the narrowest line , although there are some other stars such as ep aqr with narrow spikes on top of a broader profile ( see also knapp , young , lee & jorissen 1998 ) .    at times ,",
    "the optical light from l@xmath1 pup is over 10% polarized ( magalhaes et al . 1986 ) .",
    "since l@xmath1 pup is only 61 pc from the sun , this large polarization can not be produced by interstellar grains but must be intrinsic to the star and its circumstellar envelope .",
    "the position angle varies with time and has ranged from 156@xmath23 through 0@xmath23 up to 60@xmath23 ( magalhaes et al .",
    "the large optical polarization implies that the circumstellar envelope is anisotropic .",
    "our data were obtained on 2001 feb 05 ( ut ) at the keck i telescope using the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) which was built by a team led by b. jones and is described on the keck web page .",
    "the lws is a 128 @xmath4 128 sias bib array with a pixel scale at the keck telescope of 008 and a total field of view of 102 @xmath4 102 .",
    "we used the  chop - nod \" mode of observing , and 2 different filters centered at 11.7 @xmath0 m and 17.9 @xmath0 m with widths of 1.0 @xmath0 m and 2.0 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "following chen & jura ( 2001 ) , we used capella (= hr 1708 ) for flux and point - spread - function calibrations . for capella",
    "the fwhm of the image was 047 and 049 at 11.7 @xmath0 m and 17.9 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the images of l@xmath1pup in the 11.7 @xmath0 m in the 17.9 @xmath0 m filters are presented in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the 11.7 @xmath0 m image of capella is shown in figure 4 . because the calibrator was much more compact than l@xmath1 pup , deconvolution of the data",
    "is not required for offsets greater than 06 from the star since at these offsets , at most azimuths , the central point source contributes less than 20% of the observed intensity . in the mid - infrared , l@xmath1",
    "pup is brighter than capella , and we can not be sure that some of the very faint extended emission that we detected is real rather than an artifact .",
    "we therefore only show emission at positions where the observed intensity is at least 2% of the peak intensity . at both wavelengths , we see an extended morphology oriented along an axis at position angle 135@xmath23 with an additional distinct blob at position angle of 225@xmath23 .",
    "integrated over the image , we measure f@xmath19(11.7 @xmath0 m ) = 2500 jy ; this is comparable to the non - color corrected value of f@xmath19(12 @xmath0 m ) = 2400 jy measured with iras and the results from dirbe ( see figure 7 below ) that f@xmath19(12 @xmath0 m ) ranges between about 2000 jy and 2200 jy .    if we assume the same atmospheric extinction for l@xmath1 pup and capella , our data imply that f@xmath19(17.9 @xmath0 m ) = 1100 jy .",
    "however , because of its southern declination , there was an air mass of 2.32 during our observations of l@xmath1 pup .",
    "therefore , the atmospheric extinction correction for the flux at 17.9 @xmath0 m of l@xmath1 pup was substantial and the absolute level of our measurements at 17.9 @xmath0 m is uncertain .",
    "the data from the dirbe satellite shown below in figure 7 shows that f@xmath19(12 @xmath0m)/f@xmath19(25 @xmath0 m ) remains constant to within 5% over a pulsational cycle .",
    "interpolating the dirbe data between 12 @xmath0 m and 25 @xmath0 m indicates an average flux at 17.9 @xmath0 m of 1700 jy instead of our measured value of 1100 jy .",
    "we therefore apply an uncertain correction factor of 1.5 to our measured values of the intensities at 17.9 @xmath0 m .",
    "to model the infrared maps of the envelope , we follow a standard prescription where the dust grains are heated by light from the central star and then re - radiate in the infrared ( sopka et al .",
    "such models require estimates for the size and composition of the grains . here , we use simplified semi - analytic models to show how different assumptions and parameters propagate into our derived results .      an important parameter is the grain size .",
    "daniel ( 1982 ) has modeled the optical polarization around l@xmath1 pup by spherical grains with radius @xmath24 = 0.26 @xmath0 m with an assumed simple bipolar configuration of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "in fact , as shown by our infrared imaging , there is a blob at position angle 225@xmath23 in addition to the extended bipolar morphology extended along an axis at position angle 135@xmath23 .",
    "the spatial structure of the circumstellar dust therefore is more complex than presumed in daniel s models .",
    "everything else being equal , the more complex geometry will result in less integrated polarization .",
    "therefore , in order to reproduce the result that the polarization in the integrated light approaches 10% , the grains must be more efficient at producing polarization and therefore smaller than those postulated by daniel . jura ( 1996 ) suggested that the typical spherical particle around a mass - losing oxygen - rich star has a radius smaller than 0.15 @xmath0 m .",
    "here , we assume that most of the particles around l@xmath1 pup are similar to those around other oxygen - rich stars and thus for most of the particles @xmath24 @xmath25 0.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "since @xmath26 = 3400 k , this estimate of the grain size is such that @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath20/(2@xmath27 ) for all wavelengths of interest both for emission in the infrared and for absorption of the light from the photosphere . in this case , the temperature of the grains is insensitive to their size .",
    "a model of the grain emissivity is necessary to explain our infrared data .",
    "unfortunately , the spectrometer on the iras satellite did not acquire a good infrared spectrum of this object ( sloan & price 1998 , volk & cohen 1989 ) , and ground - based infrared spectra have not been reported in the literature surveyed with simbad .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of silicate features in the infrared dust emission can not be easily quantified .",
    "if we define @xmath28 as the ratio of the absorption cross section to the geometric cross section ( see , for example , spitzer 1978 ) , then the relationship between the opacity , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 g@xmath7 ) and @xmath28 is that @xmath29 = @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( g @xmath33 ) is the density of the solid grains which we take to equal 3.3 g @xmath33 ( kim , martin & hendry 1994 ) . a simplified version of the circumstellar silicates described by ossenkopf , henning & mathis ( 1992 ) and david & pegourie ( 1995 ) can be expressed as : @xmath28 = @xmath34 for @xmath20 @xmath25 9 @xmath0 m and @xmath28 = @xmath35 for @xmath20 @xmath36 9 @xmath0 m with @xmath37 @xmath38 0.2 .",
    "this simplified model for @xmath39 implies values of @xmath29 from which the grain temperature can be inferred , although this model does not include any spectral features such as those produced by silicates .",
    "given @xmath29 , then the grain temperature profile can be found following the prescription that the particles are heated by starlight and re - radiate in the infrared . for l@xmath1 pup with @xmath40 = 3400 k ,",
    "then typically the heating occurs near @xmath20 @xmath3 1.5 @xmath0 m , while most of the re - emission in the infrared occurs for @xmath20 @xmath41 9 @xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , following sopka et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , the grain temperature , @xmath42 , as a function of distance , @xmath43 , from the star is given as : @xmath44 a validation of this approach is to compare our simple model with more sophisticated calculations by other authors .",
    "for example , for a star with @xmath40 = 3400 k , at @xmath2 = 20 @xmath45 , equation ( 1 ) yields @xmath42 = 563 k. with detailed calculations for small silicate grains , lorenz - martins & pompeia ( 2000 ) compute that at @xmath43 = 20 @xmath45 , @xmath42 = 567 k. the closeness of this agreement is fortuitous , but it does allow that our simple model might be a useful approximation .",
    "we estimate the intensity of the circumstellar emission with the assumptions that the mass loss rate , @xmath46 , and the grain outflow velocity , @xmath47 , are constant . if we observe along a ray where the measured distance is denoted by @xmath48 , then the observed surface brightness , @xmath49 , ( jy ster@xmath7 ) is : @xmath50 for a spherically symmetric distribution , @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the impact parameter of the sight - line with respect to the central illuminating star .",

    "in addition to determining the dust loss rate , we would like to estimate the gas loss rate .",
    "the most common tracer of the amount of circumstellar gas is co. however , the circumstellar envelope around l@xmath1 pup is unusual .",
    "kerschbaum & olofsson ( 1999 ) report that the integrated intensity in the co ( 2 - 1 ) lines compared to that in the co ( 1 - 0 ) line is 12 , substantially larger than the value for this ratio measured for other semiregular stars and also larger than can be produced by any standard model for thermal excitation of this molecule ( see kahane & jura 1994 ) .",

    "red giants often exhibit asymmetrical mass loss ( see , for example , monnier , tuthill & danchi 2000 , uitenbroek , dupree & gililand 1998 ) whose origin is not well understood .",
    "it is possible that non - radial pulsations at least partly contribute to anisotropic mass loss , and this may be occuring around l@xmath1 pup . here , we argue that the hypothesis of non - radial pulsations is supported from observations of the time - variability of l@xmath1 pup at different infrared wavelengths .",
    "the basic idea is that the time variations in the flux from the circumstellar shell do not track very well the time variations in the flux emitted by the photosphere .",
    "one possible explanation for this difference is that the star undergoes non - radial pulsations .",
    "a comprehensive data base of infrared emission from bright stars was acquired with the dirbe instrument on the cobe satellite where fluxes at 9 different infrared bands were measured , sometimes more often than daily , over a 300 day period .",

    "m ) as well as in @xmath78 , it is probable that during this time interval , the radius slightly increased as well . consequently ,",

    "therefore , a model with radial pulsations is not supported by these dirbe observations . one way to understand these data",
    "is to presume that the star undergoes nonradial pulsations . in this case ,",
    "f@xmath19(12 @xmath0 m ) measures the luminosity of the entire star while f@xmath19(2,2 @xmath0",
    "m ) only measures emission from the hemisphere of the star that faces the earth .",
    "a test of this model is that the resolved dust blobs shown in figures 2 and 3 should display unsynchronized variations .",
    "additional evidence for nonradial pulsations comes from the marked time variation of the position angle of the net polarization of the star ( magalhaes et al .",
    "these data can be explained if the circumstellar blobs are differentially illuminated by a non - spherical time - varying photosphere as would occur during nonradial pulsations .",
    "the dirbe data can be used to study time - variations from other pulsating red giants besides l@xmath1 pup .",
    "we show , for example , in figures 9 and 10 , the dirbe fluxes and their deviations from their mean values , for r cas , a mass - losing infrared - bright mira red giant with a period of 430 days which lies at a distance of about 110 pc from the sun .",
    "this star exhibits time variations at both near infrared and mid - infrared wavelengths which follow each other as would be expected from radial pulsations .",
    "with @xmath79 @xmath38 3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , v@xmath80 @xmath38 3.5 km s@xmath7 and @xmath81 @xmath38 1500 l@xmath6 , the circumstellar envelope around l@xmath1 pup is well described by the models computed by winters et al .",
    "( 2000 ) where radiation pressure on the grains is relatively unimportant in the dynamics . to assess this hypothesis ,",
    "consider @xmath82 which denotes the ratio of the outward radiation pressure on the circumstellar envelope ( gas plus dust ) compared to the inward force of gravity .",
    "we may write ( winters et al .",
    "2000 ) @xmath83 with the parameters given above , then for the envelope around l@xmath1 pup , @xmath82 = 0.6 and radiation pressure does not dominate the circumstellar dynamics .",
    "besides l@xmath1 pup , there are a few other evolved red giant stars where the measured circumstellar gas exhibits velocity widths smaller than 5 km s@xmath7 .",
    "jura & kahane ( 1999 ) have proposed that some of these stars , such as the red rectangle and ac her which are known close binaries ( van winckel et al .",
    "1998 ) , possess orbiting molecular reservoirs .",
    "they hypothesize that the orbiting material may be produced by interactions of the secondary star with the envelope ejected by the mass - losing star .",
    "there is no evidence for a companion around l@xmath1 pup .",
    "however , at 61 au from the star , the region where our infrared data indicates the presence of a large amount of circumstellar dust , the escape velocity is 5.4 km s@xmath7 which is larger than the inferred gas outflow speed .",
    "if l@xmath1 pup has an undetected low - mass companion , the interaction of the wind with this star might produce some gravitationally bound matter in a circumbinary disk .",
    "an red giant star may be spun - up by engulfing a companion , and soker ( 2000 ) has proposed that such stars with relatively high rotation rates may sometimes eject mass in a very flattened slow - moving outflow .",
    "however , there is no reported evidence that l@xmath1 pup is rotating particularly rapidly .",
    "also , although this picture of a flattened outflow may partially explain the observation around l@xmath1 pup of an apparent axis of symmetry at position angle 135@xmath23 , the presence of a distinct blob at position angle 225@xmath23 is not naturally explained with this model .",
    "the current mass - loss phase of l@xmath1 pup may be important in its evolution .",
    "if l@xmath1 pup persists in losing mass at @xmath3 3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 for 5 @xmath4 10@xmath18 yr , consistent with the models for stellar evolution computed by lattanzio ( 1991 ) of the agb or by girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the tip of the red giant branch , then it will lose @xmath30.15 m@xmath6 or @xmath315% of its initial main sequence mass .",
    "this estimate of the lifetime of l@xmath1 pup in its current phase is completely theoretical since it takes the dust only @xmath3 100 yr to reach the projected separation of 2 from the star seen in our infrared images .",
    "l@xmath1 pup may serve as a test of the proposed mass loss rate from red giants .",
    "this is important because it is not possible to compute with confidence the mass loss rate from our current understanding of stellar evolution ( see , for example , catelan 2000 , schroder & sedlmayr 2001 ) .",
    "although recognizing that there are many uncertainties , catelan ( 2000 ) has proposed that the mass loss rate from red giant stars can be parameterized by the expression @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the acceleration of the star ( cgs ) , and @xmath86 and @xmath45 are in solar units . in the case of l@xmath1 pup , this formula predicts a mass loss rate of 1.1 @xmath4 10@xmath87 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , a factor of 30 less than we infer . it could be that the formula of catelan ( 2000 ) fails to describe adequately the mass loss from l@xmath1 pup because it does not distinguish between pulsating and non - pulsating stars",
    "some red giants in 47 tuc with roughly the same luminosity as l@xmath1 pup do not exhibit any 12 @xmath0 m excess ( ramdani & jorissen 2001 ) .",
    "a similar result is found for red giants in the neighborhood of the sun ( jura et al .",
    "2001 ) . if these stars are losing mass , it is without the production of large amounts of dust . in the models of winters",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) , the dust is not necessary to drive the mass loss , and thus there might be red giants with large mass loss rates and little dust formation .",
    "catelan s formula possibly applies to non - pulsating red giants with luminosities near 1000 l@xmath6 .",
    "we have obtained mid - ir images of the dust around l@xmath1 pup .",
    "we find the following :    * we estimate a total mass loss rate of @xmath33 @xmath4 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 . during the current phase of its evolution ,",
    "l@xmath1 pup may lose @xmath315% of its initial main sequence mass .",
    "*   non - radial pulsations may at least in part account for the observed asymmetric mass loss , time variations of the infrared fluxes , and time variations of the position angle of the optical polarization .",
    "* l@xmath1 pup might serve as the prototype of an outflow driven by stellar pulsations with radiation pressure on dust being relatively unimportant , as in models described by winters et al .",
