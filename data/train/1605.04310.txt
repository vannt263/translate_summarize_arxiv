    "our understanding of planet formation benefits from the discoveries of dependences of planet occurrence rate on host star properties .",
    "one such correlation that has been widely studied is that between planet occurrence rate and host star metallicity .",
    "based on a sample of four systems , @xcite first noticed that giant planets were more often found around metal - rich stars , although he considered this correlation as the signature of self - pollution during the planet formation process following the description of @xcite .",
    "follow - up studies with larger samples confirmed the existence of such a correlation , but attributed this planet - metallicity correlation to be `` primordial '' rather than due to planet pollution @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite applied a uniform spectroscopic analysis technique to more than one thousand fgk stars with and without planet detections on the keck , lick , and anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) planet search surveys , and concluded that stars with exoplanets bear no accretion signature and thus are born in higher metallicity molecular clouds . in addition , they found a power - law fit to the data , suggesting that the formation probability for gas giant planets is proportional to the square of the number of metal atoms .",
    "the presence of the planet - metallicity relation in the giant planet regime supports the core accretion model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rather than the disk instability model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the preferred mechanism for giant planet formation within a few au separation from the star @xcite .",
    "unlike the well - established planet - metallicity correlation for giant planets , it is still unclear whether smaller planets ( planet radius @xmath0 , or planet mass @xmath1 ) , especially terrestrial planets ( @xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also follow a planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "early studies based on limited numbers of low - mass planets detected in radial velocity surveys suggest that the giant planet - metallicity correlation does not extend quantitatively to the small planet regime @xcite .",
    "a better constraint on the small planet - metallicity correlation requires a much larger number of small planet detections .",
    "this became possible only recently thanks to the _ kepler _ space telescope @xcite .",
    "thousands of small planet candidates have been detected by _",
    "@xcite , and the majority of them are either confirmed or believed to be bona fide planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several studies have been conducted to investigate the small planet - metallicity correlation based on the _ kepler _ planet catalog .",
    "@xcite obtained high - resolution spectra for a sample of 152 stars hosting 226 _ kepler _ planet candidates , including 175 with radii smaller than @xmath3 . by comparing the cumulative metallicity distributions of hosts of planets with @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ", they found that the observed frequency of giant planets as a function of host star metallicity requires a much steeper relation for giant planets than for smaller planets .",
    "they also found that small planets could form around stars with a wide range of metallicities .",
    "however , because @xcite did not have a reference sample of stars without any transiting planets ( sntp ) , they were unable to tell whether the hosts of small planets were preferentially metal - rich or not .",
    "@xcite and @xcite constructed the reference stellar samples in two different ways , used different statistical methods , and reached different conclusions .",
    "these two studies used the same sample of stars with transiting planets ( stp ) .",
    "this stp sample consists of 405 _ kepler _ stars orbited by 600 planet candidates , and the parameters of these host stars are measured spectroscopically @xcite . @xcite then constructed a reference sample of solar - like kepler stars without detected transiting planets ( sntp ) .",
    "to do so , they adopted the stellar parameters of stars in this sample as determined photometrically by @xcite , but corrected these parameters for the well - known systematic offsets between photometrically- and spectroscopically - determined stellar parameters .",
    "this allowed them to put the parameters of stars in the stp and sntp samples on a common footing .",
    "they divided both stp and sntp samples into two groups , a metal - poor group with [ fe / h]@xmath6 and a metal - rich group with [ fe / h]@xmath7 , and studied the planet occurrence rates in both groups .",
    "they found that the occurrence rate of planets with @xmath5 in the metal - rich group is about twice as high as that in the metal - poor group . in @xcite ,",
    "the reference sample consists of 88 dwarf stars from the asteroseismic sample @xcite , which have stellar parameters spectroscopically determined in the same way as those in the stp sample . by comparing the overall metallicity distributions via the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test",
    ", @xcite reported a null detection and 3-@xmath8 detection of planet - metallicity correlation for planets with radii in the range @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the reliabilities of both studies are undermined because of various systematic effects .",
    "the correction to photometric metallicities in @xcite may not be as clean as expected , as argued in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the statistical method used in @xcite , by comparing the cumulative distributions of metallicities of stp and sntp samples , is less effective , considering that the occurrence rate of small planets is fairly high , and their detection significance was probably inflated as stars hosting multiple planets were counted multiple times .",
    "furthermore , @xcite selected their sntp sample from the asteroseismic star sample , which presumably would have stellar properties different from the stp sample because . in fact , the 88 dwarf stars used in the sntp sample of @xcite have a mass distribution that is different from that in their stp sample . sample and stp sample with small planets ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "we find the two - sample ks test @xmath12 value to be @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) for the mass distribution .",
    "in contrast , the two - sample ks test @xmath12 value for the metallicity distribution is 0.026 ( 2.2@xmath8 ) . ]",
    "this systematic bias undermines their claim of the planet - metallicity correlation for planets with @xmath10 . in addition , the division at @xmath15 was considered arbitrary according to @xcite .",
    "because the formation of primarily rocky planets requires the presence of metals , one would expect that the planet - metallicity correlation should , at least qualitatively , be present for planets with broader ranges of planet mass / radius .",
    "if such a correlation exists , we are interested in knowing what kind of form it may take , and furthermore in understanding why it has not been detected in the small planet regime especially in @xcite .",
    "we propose a generalized form to describe the planet - metallicity correlation in section  [ sec : form ] , which is extended from the form for the giant planet population .",
    "we find that , within this framework , the null detection of the small planet - metallicity correlation can be explained by the combination of two facts : the high occurrence rate and the low detection efficiency of such small / low - mass planets .",
    "we use a simple model to demonstrate this point in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "we discuss our result in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the fraction of stars with at least one giant planet in the specified planet parameter space , as a function of metallicity abundance @xmath16 , is described by @xcite @xmath17 this correlation is valid within a given metallicity range .",
    "for example , @xcite specified a range from @xmath18 to @xmath19 for their metallicity indicator [ fe / h ] , and found @xmath20 and @xmath21 for a sample of 1040 fgk - type main - sequence stars .",
    "we now extend the above correlation to a broader range of metallicities .",
    "the power - law form of equation  ( [ eqn : fv05 ] ) must be broken in order to reconcile the fact that @xmath22 as the fraction of stars with planets can not exceed unity .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following form @xmath23 the normalization factor @xmath24 in equation  ( [ eqn : fv05 ] ) is replaced by the saturation point @xmath25 . with this revised form ,",
    "stars more metal - rich than the _ saturation metallicity _",
    "@xmath25 will definitely have at least one planet in the parameter space where this correlation stands .",
    "this saturation metallicity is related to the normalization @xmath24 in equation  ( [ eqn : fv05 ] ) by @xmath26 .",
    "of course , there would be no saturation if @xmath22 in equation  ( [ eqn : fv05 ] ) were interpreted as the average number of planets per star ( i.e. , planet occurrence rate ) , which was also widely used in various studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in deriving the average number of planets per star , the formation and the detection of each planet in a multiple - planet system are assumed to be independent events @xcite .",
    "this assumption is probably valid when the planet distribution as functions of planetary properties , such as planet mass / radius and orbital period , is studied , but is likely inappropriate if the dependence on stellar properties , such as stellar mass and metallicity , is concerned ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the fraction of stars with at least one planet is a more reasonable interpretation of @xmath22 , with which the introduction of saturation is inevitable .",
    "the distribution of solid material among the planets in any particular system is unlikely to distort the functional form of the planet - metallicity correlation ( equation  [ eqn : form ] ) significantly .",
    "first , since @xmath22 is the fraction of stars with at least one planet , it is not sensitive to the number of planets in each system .",
    "although a multi - planet system probably undergoes chaotic evolution after its formation , which might largely reshape the whole system , it is very unlikely that any of the chaotic processes could remove all the planets from the system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as long as there is one planet surviving throughout the evolutionary stage , the system is still counted as a planetary system and the fraction of stars with planet(s ) remains unaffected .",
    "one may worry about the metal distribution between giant ( @xmath4 ) and small ( @xmath5 ) planets , because various studies have shown that they are two different populations and thus bear different planet - metallicity correlations @xcite .",
    "this means that there may be different values for @xmath25 and/or @xmath27 for giant and small planets .",
    "the distribution of solid material between the two planet populations might lead to the planet - metallicity correlation deviating from equation  ( [ eqn : form ] ) .",
    "for example , one system with enough solid material may preferentially form one giant planet rather than two or more small planets . therefore",
    ", the establishment of equation  ( [ eqn : form ] ) seems to assume that the formations of small and giant planets are unrelated .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for two reasons .",
    "first , the core accretion process , which dominates the metal distribution among planets , is believed to be a local behavior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , the dynamical evolution of some giant planets ( namely , hot jupiters ) would have significant impact on those small planets in the same system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the fraction of such systems is fairly low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore assume that the planet - metallicity correlations for small and giant planets are uncorrelated in our model , but will discuss how this assumption can be relieved in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , the saturation metallicity @xmath25 is related to the integrated fraction of stars with planet(s ) . for a sample of stars with a metallicity distribution @xmath28 , the total fraction of stars with planet(s )",
    "is then given by @xmath29 the above equation provides a relation between the saturation metallicity @xmath25 and the total fraction of stars with planet(s ) @xmath30 .",
    "we will use this relation to inversely determine @xmath25 based on our current knowledge of @xmath30 .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate with a simple but realistic model how the total fraction of stars with planets , together with the low detection rate , affects the detection of the planet - metallicity correlation . for reasons that have been given in the previous section ,",
    "each of the planetary systems generated in our simulation has only one planet .",
    "thus , in our simple model , the term `` planet occurrence rate '' is mathematically equivalent to `` the fraction of stars with planet(s ) '' .",
    "we use @xmath3 as the division between giant and small planets .",
    "this means that we can not make detailed or very quantitative comparison with @xcite and @xcite , because both studies only included planets with @xmath31 .",
    "the reason why we choose @xmath3 rather than @xmath15 is multi - folds .",
    "first , the planet - metallicity correlation for planets with @xmath10 is not yet reliably detected ( see section  [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "second , planets with @xmath10 contribute significantly to the total planet population , and thus must be taken into account when we are simulating the whole observation process through forward modeling . furthermore ,",
    "if we only include planets with @xmath31 in the mock detection process , the average detection efficiency would decrease .",
    "therefore , our result based on planets with @xmath5 provides an upper limit on the detection significance for the case with @xmath31 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to sun - like ( fgk - type dwarf ) stars in the _ kepler _ field , which are the primary targets of studies on the small planet - metallicity correlation @xcite .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the underlying stellar sample in the _ kepler _ field , @xmath28 , is taken as a log - normal distribution with mean and dispersion in @xmath32 to be @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "these values are chosen based on the massive low - resolution spectra of 12,000 _ kepler _ stars @xcite from the large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope survey ( lamost , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these values are also consistent with the measurements of red giant stars at the location of the _ kepler _ field from sdss - iii / apogee survey @xcite .",
    "deviations from the adopted metallicity distribution would have effects on the detection of the planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "however , according to equation  ( [ eqn : eta - z0 ] ) , such effects can be accounted as a modest change of the overall planet occurrence rate @xmath30 . for simplicity",
    ", we therefore choose a single metallicity distribution @xmath28 , but consider different values of @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the planet - metallicity correlation ( equation  [ eqn : form ] ) applies to planets with orbital periods from 5 days to 4.4 yr ( i.e. , the snow line for a sun - like star , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mostly for the purpose of deriving the nominal planet occurrence rate .",
    "we remind that these boundaries must be chosen based on physical considerations rather than observational constraints . in particular , one should not only include planets within @xmath35 day orbit simply because the _ kepler _ planet search is close to complete within such a limit . here the inner boundary ( 5 days ) is adopted because planets inside such an orbit may have undergone significant atmosphere evaporation , so that may show deviation from their primordial planet - metallicity correlation @xcite .",
    "the outer boundary is adopted because planets inside and outside the snow line might show different orbital distributions and/or dependence of stellar properties @xcite .",
    "the choice of these boundaries only affects the result marginally .",
    "planets beyond the adopted outer boundary have extremely low probability to be detected .",
    "in fact , the transit probability for a planet at @xmath36  yr is already @xmath37 .",
    "planets inside the adopted inner boundary do have larger probability to be detected , but the occurrence rate declines much more dramatically for shorter orbital periods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the transit probability increases by a factor of three as the orbit shrinks from 5-day to 1-day period , but the planet occurrence rate is suppressed by more than an order of magnitude @xcite . furthermore , the impact of choosing a different period interval can be mostly accounted for as a variation in the overall planet occurrence rate .",
    "the latter will be discussed in details later .",
    "we describe our choices for the fraction of stars with giant / small planets as follows . for giant planets",
    ", @xcite found the occurrence rate to be @xmath38 for planets with @xmath39 and orbital period @xmath40 within 400 days . we take this as a lower limit on the fraction of fgk stars with giant planets ( @xmath4 ) up to 4.4 yr orbit .",
    "the upper limit is chosen to be @xmath41 based on the result from @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fraction of stars with giant planets out to 4.4 yr orbit , @xmath42 , is in the range @xmath43 . for small planets ( @xmath5 ) , @xcite and @xcite",
    "all found the occurrence rate of such planets within 100-day orbit to be @xmath44 .",
    "we then use the result from @xcite to correct for the difference between the average number of planets per star and the fraction of stars with planets , and find that @xmath45 of sun - like stars hold small planets with orbital period in the range @xmath46 days .",
    "our knowledge of the occurrence rate of small planets beyond @xmath35-day orbit is very limited , due to the difficulty in detecting such planets via either transit or radial velocity techniques .",
    "therefore , we extrapolate the above result to 4.4 yr orbital period by assuming a flat distribution in @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we find that the nominal value of the fraction of stars with small planets out to 4.4 yr orbit , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 .",
    "although this value serves as a reference in our model , our conclusion stands as long as @xmath50 ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "we choose @xmath51 as the nominal value for the power - law index @xmath27 of the planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "this is the value found for the giant planets in the _ kepler _ field in @xcite .",
    "we also consider @xmath27 values up to 3 , which is approximately the highest value reported in literature @xcite . ) for @xmath27 was reported in @xcite , it is consistent with our choice of the upper limit within 1@xmath8 . ]      with the planet - metallicity correlation described by equation  ( [ eqn : form ] ) , we run the following simulation to construct synthetic stellar samples for the detection of the planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "we first randomly draw metallicities for a significantly large number of stars from the given metallicity distribution @xmath28 .",
    "these stars are then assigned with planets according to @xmath22 , which quantifies the probability to host a planetary system for a given metallicity .",
    "after this step , the original stellar sample is now divided into two : stars with planets ( sp ) and stars without planets ( snp ) .",
    "each system in the sp sample is then randomly assigned with following orbital parameters : an inclination @xmath52 that is drawn from a uniform @xmath53 distribution , and an orbital period @xmath54 that is drawn from a flat distribution in @xmath47 @xcite between 5 days to 4.4 yrs @xcite .",
    "given a host star with mass @xmath55 and radius @xmath56 , if the inclination @xmath52 and the orbital period @xmath40 allow for planet transit , this system falls into the underlying sample of stars with transiting planets ( stp@xmath57 ) .",
    "systems in the sp sample that do not meet the above condition , and all systems in the snp sample , form the underlying sample of stars without transiting planets ( sntp@xmath57 ) . in the end , we randomly draw @xmath58 and @xmath59 systems from the stp@xmath57 and sntp@xmath57 samples , respectively , to generate the synthetic stp and sntp samples for the mock detection .",
    "we simulate the detection process following the method that was used in @xcite .",
    "we compare the cumulative distributions of metallicities of the two samples ( stp and sntp ) , and quantify the significance of the difference by the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test @xmath12 value . to account for the fractional uncertainty in the metallicity measurement @xmath60 ,",
    "we conduct 200 realizations : each time the metallicities are randomly drawn from log - normal distributions with standard deviation @xmath60 around the nominal values .    for our fiducial run ,",
    "we choose @xmath61 , and @xmath62 dex , all of which are similar to those used in @xcite . and @xmath59 , and thus the deviation of the adopted numbers from the numbers in @xcite is within 20% .",

    ", the two - sample ks test @xmath12 value is found to be less than @xmath66 , suggesting a greater - than @xmath67 detection of the input planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "by contrast , given a two - sample ks test @xmath68 , the correlation for the small planet population , although with the same @xmath27 value , can not be considered as a detection .    to further quantify how frequent a null detection ( ks @xmath12 value @xmath7 ) happens",
    ", we generate 1000 sets of synthetic stp and sntp samples for planet occurrence rate @xmath30 in the range from 5% to 95% , and then run the mock detection process to find the two - sample ks test @xmath12 values .",
    "our results are shown in figure  [ fig : pval - eta ] . here",
    "the solid lines show the median @xmath12 value and the filled regions enclose 68% and 90% probabilities .",
    "figure  [ fig : pval - eta ] confirms our suspicion that the high planet occurrence rate undermines the detection significance of the planet - metallicity correlation . using the adopted parameters ( sample size @xmath61 , and @xmath62 dex )",
    ", we find that for the nominal small planet occurrence rate ( @xmath49 ) , the probability is @xmath69 that one random set of stp and sntp samples can not yield a reliable detection ( @xmath70 ) , and that in particular , the probability to have a ks @xmath12 value no less than that ( 0.14 ) found in figure  [ fig : trial ] is fairly significant ( 15% ) .",
    "furthermore , the chance is greater than 5% that a random realization can not yield a detection of the planet - metallicity correlation , as long as more than half of stars hold planets in the specified parameter space .",
    "in contrast , the giant planet - metallicity correlation can almost always be reliably detected , and the example shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : trial ] is very typical ( with @xmath7130% chance ) .",
    "as an extension , we also consider whether our model explains the null detection of the small planet - metallicity correlation in the radial velocity observations .",
    "we keep using the labels stp and sntp here simply for convenience .",
    "we reduce @xmath58 and @xmath59 to 23 and 822 , in order to match the numbers in @xcite . after assigning orbital parameters to the planets in the sp sample",
    ", we also randomly assign planet radii , which are drawn from a flat @xmath72 distribution between @xmath73 and @xmath3 , and then estimate the planet masses using the planet mass - radius relation from @xcite .",
    "the detection criterion is adopted such that the stellar radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath74 m  s@xmath75 .",
    "our revised model shows that with current rv sample sizes and precision , a small planet - metallicity correlation with @xmath63 remains undetectable even for very low occurrence rate .",
    "therefore , we are able to explain the null detection of the planet - metallicity correlation in the small planet regime by combining the high occurrence rate and low detection probability ( low transit probability or inadequate radial velocity precision ) of such planets . a universal planet - metallicity correlation , in the form of equation  ( [ eqn : form ] ) , can not be excluded based on current sample sizes , detection efficiency and data quality .",
    "our model can also reproduce the tentative detection in @xcite on the occurrence rate enhancement due to stellar metallicity . using the planet - metallicity correlation @xmath22 and the stellar metallicity distribution @xmath28 ( labelled as `` all '' ) in figure  [ fig : trial ] , we compute the relative planet occurrence rate of metal - rich to metal - poor stars similar to that in @xcite , @xmath76 . for planets with sizes below @xmath3 ,",
    "we find the enhancement to be @xmath77 .",
    "the enhancement remains the same if planets with sizes below @xmath15 are concerned , because neither @xmath22 nor @xmath28 depends on the planet size .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the number reported in @xcite .",
    "as shown above , the two - sample ks test on the overall metallicity distribution becomes less sensitive to the planet - metallicity correlation once the planet occurrence rate is relatively high .",
    "however , given that this statistical approach is simple ( compared to the method of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and model - independent ( compared to the forward modeling method ) , there is still potential usage of it .",
    "we now investigate that , with this two - sample ks test method , how large the stp and sntp samples should be in order to detect the planet - metallicity correlation for small planets , assuming there is one .",
    "again by taking advantage of the fact that the two - sample ks test is sensitive to the harmonic mean , we assume both stp and sntp samples have the same number of stars , in order to reduce the degree of freedoms of our model . given the nominal small planet occurrence rate @xmath64 , we search for the threshold sample size @xmath58 , with which a random realization has a 95% probability to yield reliable ( @xmath70 ) detection of the correlation .",
    "we consider three values for the uncertainty of individual metallicity measurement : 5% , 10% , and 20% .",
    "our result is shown in figure  [ fig : sample - sizes ] .",
    "this result suggests that with current sample size ( @xmath61 ) and metallicity precision ( 0.08 dex ) , a value for @xmath27 up to 3 can not be confidently excluded .",
    "it also indicates that , with a precision of 5% metallicity measurement , if the small planet - metallicity correlation also has a power - law index @xmath63 , a sample size @xmath58 ( @xmath78 ) nearly twice as large as it is now is required in order to reliably detect the correlation .",
    "we note that the stp sample in @xcite has already accumulated 251 small planet hosts , but a rigorously selected sntp sample has not reached an equivalent size .    the @xcite approach , as a simplified version of the method used in @xcite , requires metallicity measurements of an even larger sample of stars in the sntp sample , or a reliable calibration of between the photometric and spectroscopic metallicities .",
    "however , this latter approach has the advantage of quantifying the parameter @xmath27 , as has been demonstrated by various studies on the giant planet - metallicity correlation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in addition to simply acquiring metallicity measurements for more stars , another potential improvement would be utilizing stars with metallicities in the range where the correlation has large dynamic change . as shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : trial ] , our model suggests that @xmath22 for small planets saturates around solar metallicity , predicting that stars with sub - solar metallicities are perhaps better targets for detecting @xmath27 .",
    "we start from the naive expectation that the planet - metallicity correlation should at least qualitatively hold for planets smaller or less massive than neptune .",
    "we then derive the general form of this planet - metallicity correlation ( equation  [ eqn : form ] ) , by extending the functional form that has been widely used for giant planets to a broader range of metallicities .",
    "the saturation metallicity @xmath25 is therefore introduced for the purpose to reconcile the monotonic increasing behavior of @xmath22 as a power law of metallicity @xmath16 and the fact that @xmath22 as the fraction of stars with planets should not exceed unity .",
    "with this general form , we demonstrate with a simple but realistic model that the null detection of the planet - metallicity correlation in the small planet regime in @xcite and radial velocity studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be explained by 1 ) more than half of stars host at least one small planet , and 2 ) the methods that are used to detect such planets are very inefficient .",
    "for the transit method , the detection efficiency is limited by the transit probability to typically a few percent . for radial velocity method , the stellar radial velocity semi - amplitude induced by most of the low - mass planets are below the current detection limit . because of the high planet occurrence rate and low detection efficiency , the sample of stars without any detected planets is in fact contaminated by a significant fraction of stars having ( undetectable ) planets .",
    "therefore , the difference between the metallicities of planet hosts and reference stars is significantly reduced , even though the input planet - metallicity correlation is strong .",
    "our model also reproduces the result in @xcite , namely the enhancement on small planet occurrence rate due to the stellar metallicity .",
    "therefore , we are able to reconcile the two observational results @xcite that were thought contradictory .",
    "our model is simple but nevertheless realistic in the sense that it captures the main features that are necessary to reproduce observations .",
    "first , because the fraction of stars with planets is concerned , we assume that all planetary systems have only one planet in order to avoid the complexity arisen from multiple - planet systems .",
    "after all , we do not intend to quantify the difference between the metallicity distribution of stars with giant planets and that with small planets to compare with @xcite and @xcite , because that would require a detailed forward modeling of the multi - planet system formation and/or a better handle on the coupling of the small and giant planet - metallicity correlations .",
    "when simulating the planet detection process , we only consider the intrinsic detection limits such as the transit probability and the stellar radial velocity semi - amplitude , and ignore other observational limitations such as the signal - to - noise ratio of transit signals and the duration of rv observations .",
    "we did not take into account the uncertainties on other observables except the stellar metallicities either .",
    "the inclusion of all these observational products could only further reduce the detection significance of the planet - metallicity correlation .    in order to detect the planet - metallicity correlation for small planets ,",
    "if there is one , metallicity measurements of more stars are needed . for transit method , which is currently the most efficient technique to detect such small planets",
    ", it requires metallicity measurements of a larger sample of stars without any detected planets .",
    "given the form of the correlation , we also suggest that stars with sub - solar metallicities would be better targets for detecting the small planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "we find that , given current observational constraints , it is still possible that the planet - metallicity correlation for small planets has the same power - law index @xmath27 as that for giant planets . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : form ] , the planet - metallicity correlations for small and giant planets are in general assumed to be decoupled .",
    "this assumption is no longer necessary with the two correlations sharing the same @xmath27 , as long as @xmath22 in equation  ( [ eqn : form ] ) is interpreted as the fraction of stars with planets larger than a given size / mass ( rather than planets of either giant or small population ) .",
    "the theoretical implication is profound if the small planet - metallicity correlation shares the same power - law index as the giant planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "the formation of planets within a few au separation from their hosts is believed to be through accretion of either km - sized planetesimals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or centimeter- to meter - sized pebbles ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a formation mechanism intrinsically requires @xmath79 regardless of the size of the planet , because the overall particle collision rate is proportional to the square of the number of particles .",
    "the efficiency of the accretion process relies on the total amount of solid material in the disk . for giant planets ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the accretion process needs to be efficient as to form a massive rocky core ( @xmath80 ) before the gas is depleted in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "this massive core could then initiate the run - away gas accretion and eventually grows into a gas giant .",
    "therefore , the more massive the disk is the more likely a giant planet can be formed @xcite , and the relatively high saturation metallicity is justified .",
    "such an efficient accretion process is not required for the formation of small planets ( @xmath5 ) , and thus a much lower saturation metallicity is sufficient .",
