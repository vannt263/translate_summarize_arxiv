    "in this section , we will discuss the negative refraction and backward wave propagation in quasiisotropic media .",
    "the refracted wave in quasiisotropic media can be determined by the two principles : first , the boundary conditions require that the tangential component of the wave vector , is conserved across the interface , @xmath88 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the same principles are also used to predict the refracted wave in more complex systems such as multilayers  @xcite and photonic crystals  @xcite .",

    "the poynting vector in quasiisotropic media is neither parallel nor antiparallel to the wave vector , but rather makes either an acute or an obtuse angle with respect to the wave vector . in general , to distinguish the positive and negative refraction in quasiisotropic media , we must calculate the direction of the poynting vector with respect to the wave vector .",
