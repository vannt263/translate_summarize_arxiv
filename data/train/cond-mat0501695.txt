    "it is well known that most liquids upon supercooling undergo a transition to an amorphous state , where mechanical properties typical of a solid phase combine with a microscopically disordered structure  @xcite . just below the melting temperature",
    "the supercooled liquids manifest a slowing down of dynamics .",
    "this behavior has been successfully interpreted in terms of the mode coupling theory ( mct ) which is able to predict the asymptotic properties of the density correlators upon decreasing temperature on approaching a temperature @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this temperature marks a crossover from a region where the exploration of the phase space of the system is determined by structural relaxations , to a region where it is determined by hopping processes . in the last few years",
    "theoretical approaches based on the analysis of the potential energy landscape ( pel ) of the supercooled liquid have driven a significant progress in the study of the thermodynamics of the glass transition below @xmath0  .",
    "the phenomena related to the glass transition are yet not well understood in the case of liquids in confined geometries or at contact with solid surfaces although these situations are very relevant for many technological and biological applications .",
    "it is in fact still not clear how the theoretical approaches developed for bulk supercooled liquids can be extended to describe the corresponding phenomenology when liquids are confined .",
    "while it has been shown that mct works also for interpreting the dynamics of confined liquids in several cases  @xcite , no studies of dynamics in confinement below @xmath0 have so far been performed .",
    "it is therefore very relevant to study how the pel and the thermodynamical properties below @xmath0 are modified by the presence of confinement .",
    "recently a mean field analysis of the pel for thin films has shown that confinement could affect the thermodynamical behaviour and the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "as proposed by different authors  @xcite the behavior of a bulk supercooled liquid is determined by the dynamics of the system in and between the basins of the pel . at low enough temperature",
    "there are two separated regimes , the dynamics on the short time scale can be described as the motion around the local minima , while the long time dynamics is related to the transition between different basins of energy .",
    "this separation of regimes has been framed by stillinger and weber ( sw )  @xcite in the formalism of the inherent structures ( is ) . according to their definition an is is the configuration of local minima of the pel .",
    "a basin is the set of points which maps to the same is under a local energy minimization performed by a steepest descent procedure starting from a configuration equilibrated at a certain temperature . in the sw formulation under the assumption",
    "that the basins with the same is energy @xmath1 have equivalent properties in the canonical partition function the motions between different basins and the vibrations inside a single basin can be decoupled .",
    "this formulation allows one to define and study a configurational entropy @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity , which represents the difference between the liquid and the disordered solid entropies , plays a central role in understanding the glass transition .    in the process of cooling the configurational entropy decreases and eventually vanishes at a finite temperature , defined as the the kauzmann temperature @xmath3  @xcite . in the interpretation of adam , gibbs and di marzio",
    "@xcite at @xmath3 an ideal thermodynamical transition should take place from the supercooled liquid to an amorphous phase with a single configuration  .",
    "the singular behavior of thermodynamical quantities measured in experiments at the conventional glass transition temperature @xmath4 would be related to the _ true _ transition occurring at @xmath5 .",
    "it is generally found that phase transitions in confined fluids are modified by confinement both from geometric effects and the interaction with the substrate .",
    "this is particularly true when large spatial correlations are expected to take place and finite size effects could influence the transition in a fluid confined in a restricted environment",
    ". this would be also the case for the glass transition at @xmath3 if it is interpreted in terms of a second order phase transition  @xcite or in the framework of the mosaic state scenario  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the case of a glass forming confined liquid , a lennard - jones binary mixture ( ljbm ) , embedded in a disordered array of soft spheres .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for this system upon cooling and a numerical test of mct properties has been carried out .",
    "the mixture follows also in this confining environment , as in the bulk , mct predictions very well  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless important differences due to confinement are found .",
    "in particular the range of validity of the mct predictions suffers a reduction of @xmath6 with respect to the bulk .",
    "we found a crossover temperature @xmath7 ( in lennard - jones units ) to be compared with the bulk value @xmath8 ( in lennard - jones units )  @xcite and therefore we observed a reduction of circa @xmath9 of @xmath0 in going from the bulk to the confined ljbm .",
    "we performed in this paper an is analysis to evaluate the is distributions , the temperature dependence of the configurational entropy and finally the kauzmann temperature of the confined ljbm to be compared with the corresponding values for the ljbm in the bulk phase  @xcite .",
