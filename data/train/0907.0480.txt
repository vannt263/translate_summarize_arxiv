    "in this paper , we study symmetries of pseudospherical surfaces ( ps - surfaces , i.e. surfaces with gauss curvature @xmath1 ) in @xmath0 via the loop group method developed by zakharov - shabat @xcite , terng - uhlenbeck @xcite and toda @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations for studying symmetries is to develop a theory for non - finite - type ps - surfaces .",
    "( a rather complete investigation of ps - surfaces of finite - type is melko - sterling @xcite . ) in particular , using methods in part i we will exhibit examples with discrete rotational symmetry about an axis .",
    "these examples contain points which have properties similar to umbilic points .",
    "we believe these examples will help to develop a theory of ps - surfaces of non - finite type .    in  [ sec : lgps ] of the paper",
    "we review the main results of toda s algorithm as it has been used computationally for several years .",
    "first , we discuss the 1:1 correspondence ( up to rigid motions ) between ps - surfaces parametrized by asymptotic lines and pairs of _",
    "normalized potentials_. in preparation for understanding the relationships between symmetries at various levels , we review the precise correspondence between four levels of description for a ps - surface : the immersion @xmath2 itself , the extended orthonormal frame @xmath3 , the extended @xmath4-valued frame @xmath5 , and the normalized potential pair . the main results in this section are the construction of normalized potentials in and , and the converse in theorem [ converse ] .",
    "we also address the questions of uniqueness and differentiability , and introduce generalized potentials .",
    "in  [ sec : startsym ] we study symmetries of ps - surfaces , frames and potentials . our study is similar to that of dorfmeister and haak s study of symmetries of constant mean curvature surfaces @xcite,@xcite .",
    "our basic assumption is that there is a rigid motion @xmath6 and a diffeomorphism @xmath7 such that @xmath8 in particular we address the issue of how group actions on the surfaces relate to group actions on the space of general potentials .",
    "the main results in this section are propositions [ seppspropa ] and [ seppspropb ] .    in the second paper @xcite we will study special cases , both old and new , including symmetries via the fundamental group or rotational invariance .",
    "new examples include several with discrete rotational symmetry .",
    "one such example is shown in figures 1 and 2 of this paper .",
    "here , we want to summarize the loop group method for constructing ps - surfaces .",
    "we aim to give a compact exposition , so some proofs will be omitted .",
    "we begin by reviewing some well - known facts about ps - surfaces , beginning with the fact that the asymptotic lines form a chebyshev net , and the angle between them satisfies the sine - gordon equation :    let @xmath9 be an oriented immersed ps - surface . near any point of @xmath10 , there are coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are unit vectors and asymptotic directions , and @xmath15 agrees with the orientation . then the counterclockwise angle @xmath16 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 satisfies the sine - gordon equation @xmath17 let @xmath18 . if we define the darboux frame ( see figure below ) @xmath19 then the orthogonal matrix @xmath20 whose columns are @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22    for this calculation , see  6.4 in @xcite .",
    "we also have the converse :    let @xmath10 be a simply connected open set in @xmath23 and let @xmath24 be an @xmath25-valued function on @xmath10 that satisfies for some smooth function @xmath26 on @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath27 satisfies the sine - gordon equation , and there is a map @xmath28 which is an immersion at points where @xmath29 , whose image is a ps - surface with darboux frame given by the columns of @xmath20 .      rather than using a darboux frame , it will be more convenient to use a frame that includes the unit vector @xmath13 . accordingly",
    ", we let @xmath3 denote the frame obtained by rotating the first two vectors of the darboux frame @xmath20 through the clockwise angle @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 then @xmath32    the sine - gordon equation for @xmath16 is derived as the compatibility condition for the overdetermined system , by setting @xmath33 .    the sine - gordon equation is invariant under the 1-parameter group of lie symmetry transformations of the form @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "hence , @xmath36 will satisfy an overdetermined system with the same compatibility condition ; in fact , @xmath37 for any fixed @xmath38 , @xmath39 is an orthonormal frame for a ps - surface ; these ps - surfaces make up an _ associated family _ of ps - surfaces , which includes the original ps - surface when @xmath40",
    ".      it will also be convenient to work with matrices in the lie group @xmath4 instead of @xmath25 . recall that we can identify @xmath41 with the lie algebra @xmath42 in a way that the adjoint action of @xmath4 corresponds to rotations in @xmath41 , with every rotation in @xmath25 being realized by @xmath43 for two possible elements @xmath44 , differing by a minus sign .",
    "this gives a double cover @xmath45 .",
    "provided that @xmath10 is simply - connected , we can choose a well - defined lift of @xmath39 into @xmath4 , and we let @xmath46 denote this mapping , which we will also refer to as the extended frame of the surface .    to specify the lifting , we fix an identification of the standard basis vectors @xmath47 for @xmath41 with matrices in @xmath42 given by @xmath48 ( this identification has the virtue that the cross - product in @xmath41 corresponds exactly to the lie bracket in @xmath42 . ) let @xmath49 denote the columns of @xmath50",
    ". then @xmath51 where we are now tacitly identifying the vectors @xmath52 and @xmath47 with their matrix counterparts .",
    "we can use the differential equations satisfied by @xmath39 to deduce the components of @xmath53 the system implies that @xmath54 and @xmath55 . differentiating shows that @xmath56 u^{-1}$ ] and @xmath57u^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus , the @xmath58 coefficient in @xmath59 must be @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , implies that @xmath61 and @xmath62 , so the @xmath63 coefficient in @xmath59 must be @xmath64 thus , @xmath5 satisfies @xmath65    the compatibility condition for this system is equivalent to requiring that @xmath59 , as an @xmath42-valued 1-form on @xmath10 , satisfy the maurer - cartan equation @xmath66 for each @xmath67 .",
    "notice that the @xmath67-dependent parts of @xmath59 are on the off - diagonal only .",
    "this means that @xmath59 is a 1-form on @xmath10 taking values in the loop algebra @xmath68 likewise , @xmath5 is a map from @xmath10 to the loop group @xmath69 ( loops satisfying the @xmath70 condition are sometimes referred to as _",
    "twisted_. ) we will be specifically interested in those subgroups , denoted by @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , consisting of loops which extend to @xmath73 as analytic functions of @xmath67 .",
    "( note , however , that such extensions will take values in @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively . ) in fact , the goal of the method is to recover such loops from analytic data specified along a pair of characteristic curves in @xmath10 .",
    "within the group of loops that extend analytically to @xmath73 , we define subgroups of loops which extend to @xmath76 or @xmath77 : @xmath78 within these , we let @xmath79 and @xmath80 be the subgroups of loops where @xmath81 is the identity matrix .",
    "a key tool we will use is    the multiplication maps @xmath82 are diffeomorphisms .    in general , the birkhoff decomposition theorem asserts that the multiplication maps are diffeomorphisms onto an open dense subset , known as the * big cell*. however , it follows from the recent result of brander @xcite that in the case of compact semisimple lie groups like @xmath4 , the big cell is everything .",
    "we apply both birkhoff decompositions to @xmath5 , giving @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the superscripts in @xmath87 and @xmath88 are justified by the following important insight :    [ onlyxonlyy ] @xmath87 does not depend on @xmath12 , and @xmath89 does not depend on @xmath11 .    from",
    ", it follows that @xmath90 has the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 depend only on @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "differentiating @xmath93 gives @xmath94 the left - hand side contains only positive powers of @xmath67 , while only the @xmath58 term on the right contains such powers , so it follows that @xmath87 depends on @xmath11 and @xmath67 only .",
    "a similar argument shows that @xmath89 depends on @xmath12 and @xmath67 only .",

    ", we apply the following    [ sepps ] suppose @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 satisfy @xmath114 on some @xmath115-interval containing @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "then @xmath118 has no @xmath67-dependence .    for simplicity ,",
