    "observable diffuse galactic 1.809 mev line emission from the decay of long - lived ( 1.07 myr mean life ) radioactive @xmath0al was predicted ( arnett 1977 ; ramaty and lingenfelter 1977 ) from early estimates ( schramm 1971 ) of the nucleosynthetic yields in explosive carbon burning in core - collapse supernovae of about 10@xmath4 m@xmath2/sn of @xmath0al . assuming a galactic supernova rate of 1 sn every 30 yr , this yield suggested an average steady - state radioactive mass of 0.3 m@xmath2 of @xmath0al in the galaxy .",
    "the 1.809 mev line emission was subsequently discovered by mahoney et al .",
    "( 1982 , 1983 ) with the high resolution gamma - ray spectrometer on _ heao 3 _ at an intensity of @xmath5 5x10@xmath6 ph/@xmath7 s str from the inner galaxy .",
    "this flux , confirmed by later observations , is nearly an order of magnitude higher than that predicted , and implies a steady - state galactic mass of 3.1@xmath80.9 m@xmath2 of @xmath0al ( e.g. knodlseder 1999 ) .",
    "this much higher @xmath0al mass , together with a lack of information about its spatial distribution and the uncertainties in model predictions of @xmath0al yields , led to suggestions of a variety of additional possible sources for @xmath0al , including the winds of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , novae , and other transient sources . for a time , however , the yield calculations of neon burning and neutrino interactions in snii core collapse of the massive ( @xmath9 25 m@xmath2 ) stars without wind losses appeared ( e.g. timmes et al . 1995 ) to be adequate to account for the observed @xmath0al . but calculations ( e.g. schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) of the evolution of these stars , showed that the snii models with hydrogen - rich envelopes were not appropriate in this mass range , because their winds blow off their hydrogen envelopes leaving much smaller wr stars , which are expected to end in snib / c instead .",
    "the snii yields ( timmes et al . 1995 , thielemann et al .",
    "1996 ) of less massive ( @xmath10 25 m@xmath2 ) stars could account for no more than about 1/8 of the observed @xmath0al , and calculations ( woosley , langer & weaver 1995 ) of the yields of the snib / c supernovae of the small final mass stars that resulted from the expected large wr wind losses in single stars , suggested that these stars were also minor contributors .",
    "thus , the deep dredging of the wr winds themselves were explored as a possible major source .",
    "early calculations ( langer et al . 1995 ; meynet et al .",
    "1997 ) , assuming wr wind mass loss rates that were much larger than observations now suggest , gave the yields could account for about 1/2 of the observed @xmath0al , and very recent calculations ( vuissoz et al .",
    "2004 ) using current wind loss estimates , but including the effects of stellar rotation , now give even higher @xmath0al yields .",
    "studies of the spatial distribution of the galactic @xmath0al from comptel , by knodlseder et al .",
    "( 1999ab ) have also shown that the diffuse 1.809 mev line emission most closely correlates with the distributions of young , massive stars .",
    "this clearly implies that such stars are the source of the bulk of the galactic @xmath0al , and rules out novae , agb stars and other older population sources .",
    "this would also seem to support wr winds as the source , but other recent observations argue against that .",
    "first , the 1.809 mev flux and @xmath0al yields that would be expected from wr winds in the most recent calculations ( vuissoz et al . 2004 ) exceed by as much as a factor of 3 , the upper limits on the 1.809 mev line from comptel for the closest wr star , @xmath11velorum , assuming ( oberlack et al . 2000 ; pozzo et al .",
    "2000 ) a distance of 258 to 410 pc .",
    "this star has an estimated ( schaerer et al .",
    "1997 ) initial mass of 57@xmath815 m@xmath2 , and for a 60 m@xmath2 wr star vuissoz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) calculate a @xmath0al wind yield of 2.24@xmath1210@xmath6 m@xmath2 , with a maximum capture of 1/3 of that mass by its companion ( e.g. vanbeveren et al .",
    "whereas the 2@xmath1 upper limit of 1.1@xmath1210@xmath4 photons/@xmath7 s on the 1.809 mev line flux from this star ( oberlack et al . 2000 ) places a 2@xmath1 upper limit of ( 0.6 to 1.5)@xmath1210@xmath6 m@xmath2 , depending on the distance .",
    "second , recent analyses of the intense 1.809 mev line fluxes observed from the direction of the massive star formation regions , vela ob1 , cygnus ob2 and orion ob1a , seem to further compound the problem .",
    "analyses of vela ob1 by lavraud et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that , using the @xmath0al yields ( meynet et al .",
    "1997 ) for large wr wind losses , the expected 1.809 mev emission from both the wr winds and snii was only about 1/5 of that observed .",
    "the recent yields of vuissoz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are only about 60% higher for the expected wr stars in this association , so the wr wind yields are still only about 1/3 of that required .",
    "similarly , analyses of cygnus ob2 , using the meynet et al .",
    "( 1997 ) yields , can account for only 1/2 of the observed emission ( knodlseder et al .",
    "2002 ; pluschke et al .",
    "2002 ) , even after making a factor of 3 increase over the number of observed o stars , as a correction for obscuration .",
    "although the recently calculated yields could further close that gap , they already appear to be too high . as we show below , the recent wr",
    "wind yields also fail to account for the 1.809 mev emission observed from orion ob1a .",
    "lastly , the general problem is further complicated by the fact that no 1.809 mev emission , comparable to that from vela ob1 , cygnus ob2 , or orion ob1a , has been observed ( knodlseder et al .",
    "1999c ) from the half dozen other equally large nearby ob associations ( brown et al .",
    "we suggest that the solution to the all of these @xmath0al problems may lie in the new nucleosynthetic calculations of snib / c by nakamura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for larger final mass wr stars , that are expected ( van bever & vanbeveren 2003 ) to result from mass transfer to close binary companions .",
    "nakamura et al . ( 2001 ) calculate for he cores without late mass loss that in final , pre - supernova wr masses of 6 to 8 m@xmath2 the @xmath0al yields reach 6.7@xmath1210@xmath13 to 1.2@xmath1210@xmath3 m@xmath2 , while at high masses of 10 to 16 m@xmath2 the yields drop precipitously .",
    "although the 6 to 8 m@xmath2 yields might seem surprisingly large , such yields do seem to be quite consistent with the very steep dependence of the @xmath0al yield on final mass that woosley et al , ( 1995 ) found for snib / c of much smaller final masses expected from the earlier large wind losses .",
    "they calculated snib / c yields of 4.9@xmath1210@xmath14 to 8.4@xmath1210@xmath4 m@xmath2 of @xmath0al for final masses ranging from 2.3 to 3.5 m@xmath2 , respectively , which can be approximated by a power law in final mass to roughly the 6.5 power .",
    "such a power - law dependence would give a yield of 7.6@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath2 of @xmath0al at 7 m@xmath2 , which is quite comparable to the snib / c values calculated by nakamura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , as can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "the relationship between the initial and final , pre - supernova masses of wr stars is still uncertain .",
    "perhaps the best determined final masses are those for wr stars in close binaries , where the mutual gravitational forces , roche lobe overflow and common envelope evolution are dominate ( e.g. paczynski 1971 ; vanbeveren , de loore & van rensbergen 1998a ; taam & sandquist 2000 ) , and the distribution of final masses depends most strongly on the range of orbital parameters and stellar mass ratios , which have been extensively measured ( e.g. popova , tutukov & yungelson 1982 ; duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) .",
    "the final masses of single wr stars , however , depend ( e.g. vanbeveren et al . 1998a ; maeder & meynet 2000 ) solely on the radiation - driven wind loss rates , which vary strongly with the changing stellar luminosity , mass , rotation and metallicity .",
    "currently the principal source of wr stars with final masses in the peak @xmath0al producing range from 6 to 8 m@xmath2 appears to be those produced by mass transfer from massive stars in close binary systems with orbital periods of 1 day to 10 yrs calculated by van bever & vanbeveren ( 2003 ) .",
    "their calculated final masses , averaged over the measured ranges of orbital period , angular momentum and stellar mass ratios , are shown as a function of initial mass in figure 2b .",
    "such binary systems appear to make up about 30% of all binaries ( e.g. duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) , or 1/8 of all stars , assuming 0.4@xmath80.1 ( e.g. popova et al . 1982 ) of all stars",
    "are in binaries .",
    "recent calculations by meynet & maeder ( 2003 ) of the evolution of single wr stars including rotation effects give final masses of @xmath9 10 m@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "the snib / c explosions of such stars are expected to have low @xmath0al yields which would also make them minor contributors .",
    "other recent calculations by vanbeveren et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , however , suggest that a significant fraction of these stars may also have lower final masses .",
    "clearly further work is needed to resolve this question and the 1.809 mev observations will provide important constraints .    combining the @xmath0al yields ( woosley et al .",
    "1995 ; nakamura et al .",
    "2001 ) for snib / c models as a function of pre - supernova mass of the wr stars and the close binary mass transfer calculations ( van bever & vanbeveren 2003 ) of the pre - supernova mass versus the initial mass of the wr stars in close binaries ( figs . 1 and 2b )",
    ", we estimate the expected @xmath0al yields for snib / c versus initial stellar mass .",
    "these close binary snib / c yields are shown in figure 2a , together with estimates of the yields from snii , wr winds and single snib / c , which also include those of longer period binaries .",
    "for the snii we take the yields recently calculated by rauscher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , that include the new lower wind losses , for initial stellar masses from 15 to 25 m@xmath2 , and thoes by timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for lower mass stars , where wind losses are not thought to be important . for the wr wind yields we use those calculated by ( vuissoz et al .",
    "2004 ) . for the single snib / c and the longer period ( @xmath9 10 yr ) binaries , which should evolve like the single stars",
    ", we again take the yields as a function of final wr mass ( fig .",
    "1 ) , together with the meynet & maeder ( 2003 ) calculations of that mass versus initial mass with rotation effects ( fig .",
    "2b ) as a nominal value .    as can be seen ( fig .",
    "2a ) , the dominant @xmath0al yield is expected from snib / c of 30 to 50 m@xmath2 wr stars in close binaries .",
    "stars in that mass range make up only about 8% of all core - collapse sn progenitors ( @xmath98 m@xmath2 ) , assuming a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , those in close binaries should make up only @xmath5 1% of all galactic core - collapse sn progenitors , since close binaries include only 1/8 of all stars .",
    "we calculate the average steady - state mass of @xmath0al in the galaxy over its radioactive mean life of 1.07 myr , by integrating the @xmath0al yields ( fig .",
    "2a ) over a salpeter imf , and a total core - collapse sn rate of 1 sn every 40 yr .",
    "we find that the close binary snib / c contribute an average steady - state @xmath0al mass of 2.5 m@xmath2 , while the wr winds , snii and single snib / c contribute 1.4 , 0.4 and 0.14 m@xmath2 , respectively . for the wr wind contribution",
    ", we also included the galactic metallicity enhancement , integrating the galactic sn progenitor distribution weighted by the metallicity squared , which is proportional to the calculated wr wind yield .",
    "these contributions combine to give a total steady - state mass of 4.4 m@xmath2 of @xmath0al in the galaxy , which is somewhat higher than the 3.1@xmath80.9 m@xmath2 inferred ( e.g. knodlseder 1999 ) from the galactic 1.809 mev emission .",
    "however , as discussed above , the 1.809 mev upper limit from the nearest wr star suggest that the calculated wr wind contribution may be too high by a factor of 2 or 3 , which would also greatly improve the agreement .",
    "thus , more than 60% of the @xmath0al is expected to come from the snib / c of the 30 to 50 m@xmath2 wr stars in close binaries .",
    "since they make up only about 1% of the core - collapse sn progenitors , this contribution should come from only about 300 sn out of the roughly 26,000 sn that have occurred in the galaxy over the last 1.07 myr mean life of @xmath0al .",
    "the expected average time dependent 1.809 mev line emission from a single ob association is shown in figure 3 for a nominal moderate sized ob association that initially contained 100 core - collapse sn progenitors ( 8 to 120 m@xmath2 ) , determined from monte carlo simulations using the mass dependent @xmath0al yields ( fig .",
    "2a ) and the calculated ( schaller et al . 1992 ) stellar ages as a function of initial mass . because high - yield close - binary snib / c make up only @xmath5 1% of the sn the probability of one occurring must also be determined from monte carlo simulations for each individual ob association , based on their size and age .",
    "here we consider the three nearby associations from the direction of which 1.809 mev line emission has been measured , vela ob1 , cygnus ob2 and orion ob1a .",
    "vela ob1 is a young , massive ob association at a distance of 1.8@xmath80.4 kpc and an estimated age of 5@xmath82 myr ( lavraud et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is expected to have total of 118 to 155 core - collapse sn progenitors for this age range , based on a salpeter imf and its present population of 38 massive stars between 15 and 40 m@xmath2 ( oberlack 1997 ) .",
    "1.809 mev line emission of ( 2.9@xmath80.6)@xmath1210@xmath4 photons/@xmath7 s was observed ( oberlack 1997 ) from that region with comptel . as can be seen ( fig .",
    "4a ) , we find from monte carlo simulations that such a flux would be expected from the @xmath0al in one or two snib / c from close binary wr stars in that association about 40% of the time for ages between 5 and 6 myr .",
    "cygnus ob2 is the largest of the ob associations in the cygnus region and the 1.809 mev line emission of ( 5.8@xmath81.5)@xmath1210@xmath4 photons/@xmath7 s observed from that direction by comptel ( pluschke et al . 2002 ; knodlseder et al .",
    "2002 ) is centered on it .",
    "cygnus ob2 is at a distance of 1.7@xmath80.4 kpc and its age is estimated to be 1 - 5 myr ( comeron , torra & gomez 1998 ; herrero et al .",
    "1999 ; pluschke et al .",
    "2002 ; knodlseder et al .",
    "we would expect at least 120 initial sn progenitors , based on optical observations of 40 o stars ( massey et al .",
    "but since the region lies along a spiral arm , it is highly obscured and the actual number may be significantly larger ( e.g. knodlseder 2000 ) . nonetheless , from monte carlo simulations of just the minimum number of progenitors ( fig .",
    "4b ) , we would expect 1.809 mev line fluxes in the observed range from the @xmath0al in one or two close binary snib / c in that association about 20% of the time if the age is in fact about 5 myr , and that probability would rise to about 50% if even an additional 1/3 of the o stars are unseen because of obscuration .",
    "orion ob1a is an older and smaller , but much closer association at a distance of about 0.34 kpc and an age of 11.4@xmath81.9 myr with an estimated initial 25 sn progenitors , based on the identification ( brown , de geus & de zeeuw 1994 ) of 53 stars between 4 and 15 m@xmath2 .",
    "the 1.809 mev flux observed ( diehl 2002 and personal communication 2004 ) by comptel from this region was about ( 1 to 4)@xmath1210@xmath4 photons/@xmath7 s. from monte carlo simulations ( fig .",
    "4c ) of this older association , we would expect contributions primarily from the @xmath0al produced in snii for ages @xmath910 myr which can not account for the observed flux , but for ages of 9.5 to 10 myr we would expect a residual contribution from an earlier close binary snib / c about 30% of the time which could account for the observed flux .",
    "lastly , we note that the stochastic nature of the emission also seems to be supported by the fact that 1.809 mev emission so far has been found ( knodlseder et al .",
    "1999c ) from only 1/3 of the 9 ( seen from vel ob1 , cyg ob2 , and ori ob1a , but not from cep ob2 , gem ob1 , mon ob2 , cen ob1 , ara ob1 and sco ob1 ) largest , nearby ( @xmath102 kpc ) ob associations ( brown et al . 1996 ) in which @xmath0al from even a single high - yield close binary snib / c could be seen .",
