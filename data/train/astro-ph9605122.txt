    "fast - spinning `` recycled '' pulsars in binary systems are powerful tools for the study of orbital kinematics . measurements of pulse arrival times and the variation of time delays across a pulsar s orbit provide a means of measuring orbital elements with very high precision .",
    "further , pulsars and their orbiting companions are generally compact enough that their motion can be treated as that of two point masses .",
    "observations of binary pulsars have been used to study the evolution of interacting binary systems , to measure properties of neutron stars , and to test theories of gravitation ( @xcite ) .",
    "because of the high level of interest in such experiments , much effort has been put into searching for further examples of relativistic binary pulsars . in this _ letter _",
    "we describe observations of psr  j1518 + 4904 , a 41  ms pulsar in an eccentric , 8.6 day orbit with what appears to be a second neutron star .",
    "this pulsar was discovered in a recent survey of 15,900deg@xmath6 of the northern celestial sphere .",
    "the survey observations were made with the nrao 140  foot telescope at green bank , and data were processed with the cray c90 of the pittsburgh supercomputer center .",
    "the flux density limit was 8  mjy for long - period pulsars , and the spectral sample interval was 256  @xmath7s .",
    "in addition to psr  j1518 + 4904 , two other recycled pulsars were detected : the relativistic binary psr  b1534 + 12 ( @xcite ) and the white dwarf ",
    "neutron star binary psr  j1022 + 1002 ( @xcite ) .",
    "details of the survey are given in sayer , nice & taylor ( 1996 ) .",
    "we observed psr  j1518 + 4904 with the 140  foot telescope on 83 days between 28 october 1994 and 9 march 1995 at radio frequencies between 320 and 1400 mhz .",
    "most of the data were collected in approximately bimonthly observations at 575 and 800 mhz , with observations typically made on two days at each frequency ; these observations were augmented by two 10-day sessions at 370 mhz in march / april and august / september 1995 .",
    "the extended sessions allowed full coverage of all orbital phases at a single epoch .",
    "several shorter series of observations were also made at 370 mhz , and brief observations were made at 320 mhz and 1400 mhz .",
    "average pulse profiles at our principal observing frequencies are presented in figure  [ fig : prof ] .",
    "data were collected with the spectral processor , a digital fourier transform spectrometer . in each of two polarizations ,",
    "512 spectral channels were synthesized across a 40 mhz passband .",
    "the spectra were folded synchronously at the predicted topocentric pulse period and averaged for two minutes .",
    "the resulting pulse profiles had 512 phase bins , giving 80@xmath7s resolution .",
    "pulse arrival times were measured in the conventional way : the data were de - dispersed after detection and opposite polarizations summed to produce a single total - intensity pulse profile for a given integration .",
    "this profile was cross - correlated with a standard template to measure the phase offset of the pulse within the profile .",
    "the offset was added to the start time and suitably translated to the middle of the integration to yield an effective pulse time of arrival .",
    "because the orbital ephemeris was not initially known , some early observations were made with a `` search mode '' system in which spectra were streamed to tape in raw form at intervals of 256@xmath7s .",
    "off - line processing used standard fourier techniques to measure the topocentric pulse period , and the spectra were then folded at that period to generate profiles which were processed as described above .",
    "we measured pulse times of arrival from 4496 profiles , excluding those data in which the pulsar was not detected or in which the signal was corrupted by radio frequency interference .",
    "these arrival times were averaged over spans of one hour , and a few low - quality points were eliminated , yielding a final data set of 213 average time - of - arrival measurements . these were fit to a standard model of pulsar rotational and orbital behavior using the program tempo ( @xcite ) .    as expected for a tight , eccentric binary system , the five - parameter keplerian orbital model normally used to describe `` single - line spectroscopic binary '' observations was not sufficient to remove fully the orbital time - of - flight delays from the pulse arrival times .",
    "however , we found that an excellent fit could be made by including orbital precession in the timing model .",
    "the measured rate of advance of periastron is @xmath8yr@xmath3 .",
    "the full set of timing parameters is listed in table  1 .",
    "uncertainties in the table are twice the formal errors of the timing model ; given the high covariances between many of the parameters , we believe these to be good estimates of the true uncertainties .",
    "the post - fit arrival times have root - mean - square residual of 20@xmath7s , and appear to have random scatter ( figure  [ fig : res ] ) .",
    "although the masses of the pulsar and companion can not be measured independently , the orbital elements constrain the allowed values of these quantities . first",
    ", the keplerian `` mass function '' relates the masses of the pulsar , @xmath9 , and its companion , @xmath10 , to the binary period @xmath11 and projected semi - major axis @xmath12 according to @xmath13 where @xmath14s , @xmath12 is in light seconds , @xmath11 is in seconds , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are in solar masses .",
    "the orbital inclination @xmath15 is unknown ; however , @xmath16 must be less than 1 , constraining the masses to lie outside the hatched region at the lower - right of figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "a second constraint on allowed masses comes from the precession of the longitude of periastron .",
    "such precession can in principle arise from tidal or rotational distortions of the companion , from the relativistic gravitational interaction between the two bodies , or some combination of these .",
    "given the size of the psr  j1518 + 4904 orbit , and assuming the companion is a compact object (   [ sec : discussion ] ) , the tidal and rotational distortion effects can be neglected ( @xcite ) , leaving only relativistic precession . in this case",
    "@xmath17 is a simple function of total system mass @xmath18 : @xmath19 the observed rate of precession , @xmath20yr@xmath3 , yields total a system mass of @xmath21 constraining the component masses to lie in the narrow open strip outside the gray region of figure  [ fig : mass ] .    while the masses of the pulsar and its companion can not be fully separated , figure  [ fig : mass ] shows that they must obey the constraints @xmath22m@xmath5 and @xmath23m@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "it is quite plausible that both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are close to the chandrasekhar mass , as has been observed in other eccentric pulsar binaries (   [ sec : discussion ] ) . if the masses are nearly equal , @xmath24m@xmath5 , then equation  [ eqn : massfunc ] implies an orbital inclination angle @xmath25 .",
    "because our observations span little more than a year , the influences of pulsar position , proper motion , and spin - down rate in the timing solution are highly covariant , and we can presently derive only upper limits for the period derivative and proper motion . from the period derivative limit , @xmath0 , we infer the lower limit of the pulsar s characteristic age to be @xmath26yr , among the highest measured .",
    "while the true age of the pulsar is likely less than @xmath27yr , the high characteristic age suggests that the pulsar is probably very old , and that it will evolve very little on a galactic timescale .",
    "the period derivative limit constrains magnetic field strength to be no more than @xmath28gauss under the conventional assumptions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the timing solution yields an upper limit of 60masyr@xmath3 for the proper motion of the pulsar .",
    "this limit can be improved by noting that proper motion @xmath7 of a pulsar at distance @xmath29 induces a pulse period derivative @xmath30 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed limit @xmath31 and estimated distance of 0.7  kpc yield an upper limit of 30masyr@xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to a projected space velocity of no more than 100kms@xmath3 .",
    "this is on the low end of the velocity distribution of isolated pulsars ( @xcite ) , but typical of recycled pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are several reasons to believe the pulsar s companion is a neutron star .",
    "optical observations detect nothing in the direction of the pulsar to magnitude limits @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( m. van kerkwijk , private communication ) , certainly ruling out a main sequence companion .",
    "the high eccentricity of the orbit is naturally explained as a fossil of the supernova that formed the pulsar s companion .",
    "further , it must be significant that four of the six probable double - neutron - star binaries now known , including psr j1518 + 4904 , have periods between 30 and 60ms ( see table  2 ) .",
    "their measured total system masses are all similar , and whenever the masses have been separable they are found to be nearly equal and close to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "we take these facts to be strong circumstantial evidence that the companions are neutron stars .",
    "double neutron star binaries are generally believed to evolve from high mass x - ray binaries after a stage of common - envelope evolution and spiral - in ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , van den heuvel , kaper & ruymaekers ( 1994 ) argue that it is difficult to produce the wide orbit of psr  b2303 + 46 in this way because of the extremely wide pre - spiral - in orbit that is required .",
    "they suggest the second neutron star in this system must have evolved from a very massive ( @xmath34m@xmath5 ) star which expelled its envelope without extracting energy from the orbital system ( see also kaper _ et al .",
    "given that the psr  j1518 + 4904 orbit is similar in size to that of psr  b2303 + 46 , we suppose that the psr  j1518 + 4904 system must have evolved in a similar way .",
    "further evidence for this scenario comes from the large characteristic age of psr j1518 + 4904 , which implies that the pulsar s present - day period and period derivative are close to those of the pulsar immediately after spin - up .",
    "this contrasts with psrs  b1534 + 12 , b1913 + 16 , and b2127 + 11c , in which the observed periods and period derivatives place the pulsars close to the `` spin - up line '' , the period  magnetic field relation expected after eddington accretion onto a magnetized neutron star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters of psr  j1518 + 4904 place it far from the spin - up line .",
    "a simple explanation for this is that accretion onto the neutron star was far below the eddington rate ( @xcite ) , which agrees well with the model in which the companion s stellar envelope was largely shed of its own accord rather than through binary spiral - in .",
    "because the j1518 + 4904 system is much wider than the prototypical double neutron star system of psr  b1913 + 16 , it emits far less gravitational radiation , and the relativistic decay of its orbit will be difficult to detect . using the formulae of peters ( 1964 ) , and assuming that the pulsar and its companion have equal masses",
    ", we calculate the coalescence time of the j1518 + 4904 system due to gravitational radiation to be @xmath35 years .",
    "inspiraling double neutron star binaries are a prime target for gravitational observatories such as ligo , so the birth rates and lifetimes of these systems are of great interest ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for obvious reasons , the discovery of psr  j1518 + 4904 does not significantly influence such merger - rate calculations .",
