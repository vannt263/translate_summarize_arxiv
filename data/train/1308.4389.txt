    "quantum dissipation is ubiquitous in almost all fields of condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "dissipative quantum systems are well studied with the system - plus - reservoir ( or heat bath ) model , which is nowadays often referred as the caldeira - leggett ( cl ) model@xcite .",
    "this model very well describes the underlying brownian motion@xcite . because of the fact that the corresponding classical description is well understood , quantum brownian motion has far reaching applications and is therefore still being investigated . the system - plus - bath model ( or cl model )",
    "can be described as follows : a quantum subsystem of finite degree of freedom is coupled bilinearly to a reservoir ( or heat bath ) of non - interacting harmonic oscillators .",
    "later , we integrate out the bath degrees of freedom to obtain a damped equation of motion for the system coordinates only .",
    "the infinite number of degrees of freedom in the heat bath allows for strong damping even if each individual bath oscillator couples only weakly to the system .",
    "this model has been discussed in the literature by many authors prior to caldeira and leggett , for harmonic systems@xcite and anharmonic systems@xcite .",
    "interesting effects occur when one study the dissipative effects in a magnetic field .",
    "for example , the discovery of non - classical transport of degenerate electron gas in the presence of strong disorder in quantized hall effect@xcite , temperature - dependent hall effect in high - temperature superconductors@xcite etc . in metals ,",
    "the dissipative ( or the damping ) effect due to phase smearing reduces the amplitude of the de haas - van alphen oscillation ( a non - linear oscillatory behavior of the magnetization of metals at very low temperatures and at very strong magnetic field strengths ) , and a dissipative phenomena involving carrier scattering produces the shubnikov - de haas effect ( oscillations in the conductivity of metals at very low temperatures and very high magnetic fields ) @xcite . with all these spectacular phenomena in the frontier , one may interest to choose a charged oscillator in a magnetic field ( actually a non - interacting electron gas confined in two dimensions ) as the relevant quantum system of interest .",
    "this model of a dissipative charged oscillator in a magnetic field has been studied by many authors@xcite . in particular , this model was used to study the dissipative landau diamagnetism@xcite as well as to verify the validity of the third law of thermodynamics@xcite .    in this paper , we study the dynamics of the damped charged harmonic oscillator in a magnetic field by analyzing the position and the velocity autocorrelation functions .",
    "subsequently we derive the equilibrium dispersions of the position and momentum . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have worked out the steady state equilibrium values of the position and momentum dispersions in order to compute the internal energy as the aim was to basically study the behavior of the specific heat at low and high temperatures under different limiting sequences within the framework of two different and distinct approaches to statistical mechanics , _",
    "viz_. , the _ gibbsian _ and the _ einsteinian _ approaches . some of the details about the model and the basic mathematical framework we use here can be found in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "but for the sake of continuity and completeness we describe here the model and the required mathematical details from our previous work .",
    "we study in detail the position autocorrelation function , its classical behavior at high temperatures and the quantum effects at zero temperature .",
    "also we briefly sketch the fluctuation - dissipation relation in the framework of the dissipative landau diamagnetism .",
    "it is pertinent to note here that , since we are computing the quantities at very long times compared to the system s characteristic time scale , the solution of the quantum langevin equation is independent of initial transients so that the correlations are being calculated using the stationary solution . hence we do not account here for the initial conditions and the contributions to the correlations from the initial values of the position and velocity . from the steady state results , we discuss here in detail about the temperature dependence of the position and momentum dispersions at low and high temperatures as well as its dependence on the bath spectrum at all temperatures .",
    "the dissipative charged particle dynamics ( without a confinement potential ) in a magnetic field has been studied in detail by dattagupta and singh @xcite .",
    "the position auto - correlation function of the dissipative charged oscillator in a magnetic field as well as the classical diffusive behavior of the free quantum dissipative charged particle in a magnetic field was considered in detail using the retarded green s function method by li et al .",
    "we follow almost in a similar way and our results are in par with the results obtained by them .",
    "the total hamiltonian representing the system - plus - bath model can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the system degrees of freedom , @xmath3 represents the bath degrees of freedom and finally @xmath4 is the hamiltonian representing the system - bath interaction .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of eq.([int - ham ] ) is included to suppress any unphysical renormalization of the system s potential due to the coupling with the bath , which thereby ensures the homogeneity of dissipation in all space and the translational invariance of the full hamiltonian . combining the three contributions we write the full many body hamiltonian as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two - dimensional vectors representing the momentum and position coordinates of the system respectively .",
    "similarly @xmath8 and @xmath9 are also two - dimensional vectors corresponding to the momentum and position coordinates of the bath oscillators respectively . the position and the momentum variables of the system and the bath are operators and they satisfy the following commutation relations @xmath10=i\\hbar\\delta_{ik } , ~~[{\\bf{x}}_{ji } , { \\bf{p}}_{lk } ] = i\\hbar\\delta_{jl } \\delta_{ik } .",

    "we can decompose the force operator into the following form @xmath26 where @xmath27 this random force operator @xmath28 is a stationary gaussian operator noise once the averages of the initial values @xmath29 and @xmath23 are taken with respect to the initial equilibrium density matrix of the bath in canonical ensemble @xmath30   \\bigg\\ } , \\label{bath - density - matrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the partition function of the bath . because of the spurious initial transient slip term @xmath32 in eq.([langevin1 ] ) , the quantum langevin equation appears slightly different . it has been shown in @xcite that the occurrence of the initial slip term is actually due to the decoupled thermal initial state of the total system plus bath arrangement . typically , the initial preparation of the total system - plus - bath model fixes the statistical properties of the bath operators as well as the system degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , this initial preparation is the one which renders the fluctuating force @xmath20 a truly random one .",
    "in addition to this point , the force operator becomes stochastic only if the average of it is zero at all times ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) .",
    "also this quantum brownian noise @xmath20 should constitute a stationary process with time - homogeneous correlations .",
    "but the average of @xmath20 with respect to eq.([bath - density - matrix ] ) is a non zero quantity implying @xmath20 is non - gaussian .",
    "but the force operator @xmath20 becomes a gaussian random force once we take the average of it with respect to a bath density matrix which contains shifted oscillators .",
    "the initial preparation of the bath with shifted oscillators is given by the form @xmath34",

    "the angular brackets in the above equations show that we are thermal averaging over the heat bath . the fluctuating force @xmath20 lives in the hilbert space of the heat bath .",
    "a heat bath is one which is capable of absorbing , through its many channels , energy infused by a system and this process is irreversible . in order that the hamiltonian @xmath38 ( cf .",
    ", eq.([bath - ham ] ) ) to have the required properties of a heat bath , we must definitely go to a continuum by converting all the summations over @xmath39 to integrals over the frequency of the bath excitations by introducing a suitable spectral density of states @xmath40 where @xmath41 so that @xmath42 in the framework of dissipative systems , the most employed spectral density is @xmath43 , which is often referred as ` ohmic spectral density ' .",
    "note that this term is used sometimes to indicate a proportionality to frequency merely at low frequencies instead of the whole range of the frequency spectrum . in the ohmic case @xmath44",
    "is replaced by @xmath45 so that @xmath46 $ ] reduces to a constant @xmath47 .",
    "also in the strict ohmic limit we recover the ordinary langevin equation but surprisingly the underlying stochastic process described by the random force remains non - markovian . in principle",
    "the spectral density can not go to infinity for large values of @xmath48 .",
    "so even if we introduce a cutoff to the frequency spectrum above which the spectral density vanishes , we can still use the term ohmic for frequencies below the cutoff .",
    "but the spectral density @xmath40 diverges in the strict ohmic limit for large frequencies and moreover the dispersion in the momentum shows an ultraviolet divergence while employing the ohmic spectrum . therefore it is always advised to choose a cut off in the bath modes so that the divergences in the problem can be easily solved .",
    "typically the _ drude model _ of spectral density is employed for the regularization purposes . when it comes to regularization of certain quantities",
    "it is assumed that @xmath49 is the shortest time scale available apart from the thermal time scale @xmath50 , in the problem .",
    "for the drude bath , the bath spectral density is assumed to have a smooth cutoff of the form @xmath51 which behaves like ohmic for small frequencies but will go to zero above the cut off @xmath52 .",
    "we may observe from eq.([friction - density ] ) that the damping kernel describes exponential memory on the timescale @xmath49 .",
    "that means , for positive arguments @xmath53 , the damping kernel takes a form @xmath54 with a damping strength @xmath55 , similar to ohmic one . if the timescale we are interested in is shorter than @xmath49 ( usually this is the case when @xmath52 represents the largest frequency scale in the problem ) the memory effects may often be neglected and the ohmic model may be employed instead .",

    "discussions on the fluctuation - dissipation relation , classical diffusive behavior of the free charged particle in the limit of @xmath57 , and the relation between the dispersions and the reduced partition function , are included .",
    "sec.3 is the conclusion and references follows thereafter .",
    "we assume that the system and the bath are initially ( at @xmath25 ) uncorrelated ( uncoupled ) to each other . this does mean that the initial coordinates of the system are not correlated with those of the heat bath , which immediately implies @xmath58 .",
    "the system is said to be in an arbitrary non - equilibrium state initially and due to the interaction effects caused by the bath the system looses its energy eventually and it equilibrates with the bath . obviously thermal equilibrium state is the one in which all the transients are completely died out and the equilibrium quantities are time - independent .",
    "put it in another way , the system reaches its thermal equilibrium state once it completely  explored \" its phase - space .",
    "the heat bath is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath59 so that the bath can be described by the usual gibbsian canonical equilibrium density matrix @xmath60 , where @xmath38 is the bath hamiltonian given by eq.([bath - ham ] ) , @xmath61 is the partition function of the bath and @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the boltzmann constant . if we define the initial arbitrary density matrix of the system as @xmath64 , then we may write the total initial density matrix of the system - plus - bath as @xmath65 . the interaction between the system and the bath",
    "is switched on at time @xmath66 and the system starts to evolve in the presence of the heat bath .",
    "the non - equilibrium quantum dynamical evolution of the system eventually reaches its steady state equilibrium ( with the bath ) asymptotically ( as @xmath67 ) . in other words , the system reaches equilibrium with its heat bath over very large experimental or observation time scale .",
    "the system s characteristic decay time is much larger than the bath correlation time .",
    "this is a characteristic situation of quantum brownian motion .",
    "this is in complete contrast to the case of a typical quantum optical situation where the systematic evolution of the reduced system is fast , which in turn means that coherent dynamics of the system goes through many cycles during a typical relaxation time .    by introducing the variables @xmath68 the langevin equation given in eq.([langevin1 ] ) can be recast into a convenient form given by@xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "we derived the quantum langevin equation ( cf .",
    "eq.([langevin1 ] ) ) ( and thereby eq.([langevin2 ] ) ) from the hamiltonian given in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) by projecting out ( or integrating out ) the bath variables @xmath9 and @xmath8 from the full hilbert space of the system - plus - bath .",
    "if at time @xmath25 the initial states of the system and the heat bath are uncorrelated and the bath is in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath59 and described by a density matrix @xmath71 , then the reduced dynamics of the system for @xmath53 is completely determined by @xmath72 .",
    "but the bare system hamiltonian @xmath72 given in eq.([sys - ham ] ) does not have any bath parameters or effects in it . hence we need to modify the system hamiltonian to incorporate the bath effects explicitly .",
    "nevertheless , if we look at the quantum langevin equation ( eqs.([langevin1 ] ) and ( [ langevin2 ] ) ) we see that it is derived for the system s coordinates and the equation contains both the friction and random force . which means the effects of the bath on the system , through the friction and the stochastic quantum brownian noise , are included in the system s dynamical equation of motion .",
    "this clearly indicates that the system hamiltonian ( cf .",
    ", eq.([sys - ham ] ) ) is modified by the bath .",
    "we therefore rewrite the subsystem hamiltonian as an effective stochastic hamiltonian given by@xcite @xmath73 the superscript  @xmath74 \" stands for  effective \" .",
    "the dependence of the hamiltonian on the bath parameters is explicit from eq.([langevin2 ] ) . from eq.([ham - eff ] ) the mean squared average values of @xmath7 and @xmath75 can be determined from the two equal time correlation functions @xmath76 we start with the unequal time correlation functions @xmath77 and then do an analytical continuation @xmath78 to obtain eq.([equal1 ] ) . in order to find the solution of the langevin equation in eq.([langevin2 ] ) , we here introduce the fundamental solutions @xmath79 and @xmath80 of the homogeneous part of the langevin equation , which is basically obtained by setting the right hand side equal to zero .",
    "the fundamental solutions are usually defined through the initial conditions given by @xmath81 making use of the laplace transform @xmath82 we can now write the laplace transform of the fundamental solutions as follows @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the laplace transform of the damping kernel . now with the help of the fundamental solutions ,",
    "we can easily write the general solution of the quantum langevin equation which is given by @xmath85 it is easy to find out @xmath80 .",
    "an inverse laplace transform , with eq.([second - green ] ) , gives @xmath86 taking a derivative of @xmath80 with respect to @xmath87 in the above equation , we find @xmath88 so that the general solution given in eq.([langevin - green ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath80 only and is given by @xmath89 from the formal solution given in terms of @xmath80 , one must notice that we have used the homogeneous equation @xmath90 after evaluating the integral by contour integration method , from eq.([green2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath91 , \\label{green - second}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 .",
    "therefore the final solution to the quantum langevin equation can be obtained by substituting the value of @xmath80 in the solution given in eq.([langevin - solution - green ] ) .",
    "we point out that the green s function @xmath80 introduced in this section is nothing but the response function @xmath93 of the system ( cf.eq.([response-stationary ] ) ) to an external force . therefore in our following discussions",
    "we tacitly write the response function @xmath93 instead of @xmath80 .",
    "this argument can be made more clear by changing ( analytic continuation ) the laplace transform @xmath94 to the fourier ( frequency ) domain by the substitution @xmath95 and using the property of the memory friction function @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we write @xmath98 where ( cf .",
    ", eq.([second - green ] ) ) @xmath99 note that the right hand side of the above equation is nothing but the dynamical susceptibility which is easily obtained by taking a fourier transform of the langevin equation given in eq.([langevin2 ] ) .",
    "the relation connecting the response function and the dynamical susceptibility can be expressed as @xmath100 which clearly shows us that the green s function @xmath80 is indeed the response function @xmath93 .",
    "the causal response function @xmath93 is called the generalized susceptibility .",
    "the force @xmath101 on the right hand side of the langevin equation in eq.([langevin2 ] ) satisfies the relations eq.([force - symmetric ] ) and eq.([force - antisymmetric ] ) .",
    "typically the memory friction @xmath18 falls to zero in the bath relaxation time which is very short compared to the system s time scale . for times greater than the bath relaxation time , the initial slippage term in the langevin equation vanishes .",
    "that means the spurious initial term vanishes for very long times which is compared to the system s characteristic decay time .",
    "therefore for very long times compared to the system s time scale , the langevin equation becomes a stationary one with the lower limit of the integration being @xmath102 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath103 for which we usually write the solution @xmath104 where @xmath105 where @xmath106 which is called the dynamical susceptibility can be deduced from eq.([langevin2 ] ) or eq.([langevin3 ] ) , and is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 the expression for the dynamical susceptibility in eq.([laplace ] ) is identical to the corresponding one for a classical damped charged oscillator in a magnetic field with frequency dependent damping .",
    "the absence of any quantum correction to the dynamical susceptibility is actually a consequence of the ehrenfest s theorem for strictly linear systems like what we consider here .",
    "the force @xmath101 in eq.([langevin3 ] ) satisfies the same relations given in eqs.([force - symmetric ] ) and ( [ force - antisymmetric ] ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath109 indicates that @xmath110 is a stationary process , in the sense that all the correlations and probability distributions for this dynamical variable @xmath110 are time translational invariant ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "moreover the symmetrized part of the position autocorrelation is a function of the difference of two different times only . from eq.([green function ] ) it is very much clear that so long as the frequency @xmath48 remains non zero , the response function @xmath93 will vanish exponentially for much longer times .",
    "this is in accordance with the tauberian theorem which says that the asymptotic behavior of a function depends upon the low frequency behavior of the fourier transform of the function .",
    "these principles imply that , for long times , the dependence of @xmath112 on the initial coordinates in eq.([langevin - solution - green ] ) disappears completely ( it is very much visible from the solution in eq.([langevin - solution - green ] ) with eq.([green - second ] ) that for long time @xmath113 the terms containing the initial values @xmath114 and @xmath115 vanish ) and we write @xmath116 comparing eq.([response ] ) with eq.([response - stationary ] ) for @xmath110 implies that , @xmath112 in eq.([response ] ) becomes the solution of the stationary langevin equation given in eq.([langevin3 ] ) .",

    "hence the correct classical result is recovered for @xmath378 , i.e. , @xmath379 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the position dispersion is given in figure 1 and that of the momentum dispersion is shown in figure 2 , for both low and high magnetic field strengths respectively .",
    "the results are as expected from the theory . at low temperatures , as the damping increases",
    ", the position dispersion decreases while the momentum dispersion increases .",
    "but at high temperatures , both the dispersions become independent of the dissipation constant @xmath214 and vary with @xmath59 linearly , thereby proving the classical equipartition result . at low temperatures and at a higher magnetic field strength , the dispersion in the position remains at a small value even for higher dissipation strengths .",
    "this proves the fact that strong dissipation localizes the motion and the magnetic field enhances the effect .",

    "@xmath391 is the first bosonic matusbara frequency defined earlier .",
    "we can alternatively obtain the momentum dispersion of the free damped charged particle in a magnetic field from eq.([digamma - matsubara ] ) in a summation form by taking the limit @xmath57 and is given by @xmath392 just as in the case of a damped charged oscillator in a magnetic field , for strict ohmic damping , the equilibrium momentum dispersion for the damped free particle in a magnetic field also diverges .",
    "this divergence is eliminated by regularizing it with the drude cutoff in the spectral density of the bath modes .    in the zero damping case ( @xmath393 ) , from eq.([moment - dissipation - free ] ) , after simplifications , we write @xmath394 in obtaining this result we have used the formula @xmath395 using eq.([moment - free - field ] ) , we obtain the energy @xmath396 for a free charged particle in a magnetic field in the absence of dissipation . meanwhile in the absence of the magnetic field ( @xmath186 ) , from eq.([moment - dissipation - free ] ) we get @xmath397 on the other hand , for drude bath , when @xmath186 , we have the roots @xmath398 and using which we write , from eq.([momentum - unconfined ] ) , @xmath399 which is exactly matching with the free particle result in two dimensions . at high temperatures , the first term in eq.([free - particle - momentum - result ] ) dominates .",
    "note here that in the high frequency cutoff limit ( @xmath171 ) , eq.([free - particle - momentum - result ] ) reduces to eq.([check25 ] ) .",

    "meanwhile at high temperatures , the mean squared kinematic momentum of the damped charged particle in a magnetic field behaves as @xmath404 where @xmath405 is the euler gamma which is a constant with a value @xmath406 . to obtain the above result",
    ", we have used the expansion of the digamma function @xmath407 . at high enough temperatures",
    ", we see that the equipartition theorem is satisfied and the leading correction term to the kinematic momentum dispersion is exactly similar to that in eq.([leading - correction ] ) , for the confined system .",
