    "the models proposed for driving jets and outflows from young stars can be roughly categorized as disk - driven outflows ( e.g.  pudritz et al .",
    "2007 ) , x - winds ( e.g.  shang et al . 2007 ) , and stellar wind - driven flows ( e.g.  matt & pudritz 2008 ) . in all of these models the young star is surrounded by a circumstellar disk with an outer radius of about 10 - 100au and an inner radius of only a few stellar radii .",
    "so far it has not been investigated whether any of these models can be applied to a close binary system such as kh15d , where the spectroscopic signature of a bipolar outflow has been found in the [ oi]@xmath66300 line ( hamilton et al .",
    "2003 ) . a small - scale bipolar jet of @xmath170au length in [ sii]@xmath66731 is also known for the close 19d tts binary uz taue ( hirth et al . 1997 ) and the [ oi]@xmath66300 line profile of the 15.8d tts binary dq tau of huerta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that this system also drives an outflow . in this letter",
    "we discuss for the first time simple possible models for jet formation in close tts binary systems and hope that our letter will initiate detailed theoretical and observational studies of this challenging astrophysical problem .    in recent years kh15d ( age@xmath12myr , d=760pc )",
    "has been the subject of many detailed observational and theoretical studies ( e.g. winn et al .",
    "2006 ; herbst et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "it first got attention for its unique photometric variability with deep and practically grey eclipses every 48.4 days that have become deeper and wider with each passing year ( hamilton et al .",
    "2005 ; leduc et al .",
    "as discussed in these references the following model describes the available data .",
    "a nearly edge - on binary system is surrounded by a circumbinary disk ( cbd ) which is inclined to the binary plane by @xmath710 - 20@xmath8 ( winn et al .",
    "2004 ; chiang & murray - clay 2004 ) .",
    "since more than a decade the cbd has been totally occulting the orbit of star b and has been increasingly occulting that of star a. this is due to its precession on a @xmath110@xmath9yr time scale , which causes the occulting edge to cover the orbit of the binary . during the epoch of observations discussed here ,",
    "only eclipses of star a are observed , which result from the disappearance of this star behind the occulting edge . without this sharp edge acting as a `` natural coronagraph ''",
    "it would have been practically impossible to trace in h@xmath5  or [ oi ] the much fainter emission from the outflowing gas analyzed here .",
    "the high - resolution spectra analyzed here have been obtained during various observing runs with uves at the vlt ( r@xmath150000 , slit width 0.8 - 1.0@xmath10 ) and with hires at keck ( r@xmath170000 , slit width 0.8@xmath10 ) . a full description of the data and their reduction wiil be given in hamilton et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . at the distance of kh15d",
    ", 1.0@xmath10 corresponds to 760au .",
    "the observing dates of the individual spectra are indicated in figs . 1 and 2",
    ". the continuum levels of all these spectra have been calibrated onto a common flux scale by using the cousins i band fluxes that were measured simultaneously ( or nearly so ) in our ccd imaging campaigns .",
    "one uncertainty in this procedure is the system s r - i color , since r band fluxes are requested for calibration of h@xmath5  and [ oi ] .",
    "the r - i color was calculated on the basis of the 2002/2003 data set ( hamilton et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the spectra presented here",
    ", any uncertainty will most probably affect only the two spectra taken at minimum light ( i.e. from dec .",
    "14 , 2001 and march 12 , 2004 ) , since only there is the r - i versus i correlation unreliable .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the forbidden emission lines ( fels ) of t tauri stars ( ttss ) are an important diagnostic for their outflows close to the star on scales of 20 - 40au ( hirth et al .",
    "1997 ; hartigan et al .  1995 ; eislffel et al .",
    "the most important line for these studies is the [ oi]@xmath66300 line , which is usually the strongest fel in ttss in the optical and therefore most easily observable . for kh15d ,",
    "the rather small measured out of eclipse w@xmath11([oi]@xmath66300)=0.4 - 0.5  ( which would be @xmath10.2  if both stars would be unocculted ) , compared to classical tts ( ctts ) jet sources , indicates a mass outflow rate that is @xmath110 times smaller than in other cttss ( e.g. hartigan et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in principle",
    "the h@xmath5  line is a much better diagnostic for investigating outflows on very small scales ( e.g. 0.1 - 10au from the source ) because it is not quenched above a certain electron density like fels .",
    "note that the critical density of the [ oi]@xmath66300  line of @xmath12@xmath13 is among the highest of all fels observable in the red spectral region of ttss .",
    "however , in most ttss the very bright stellar ( magnetospheric ) h@xmath5  emission makes studies close to the star extremely difficult . for kh15d",
    ", however the natural coronagraphic mask ( see sect .",
    "1 ) strongly suppresses the stellar h@xmath5  emission and allows to study the faint h@xmath5  emission from the outflow .    in fig .",
    "1 we display all our nine uves / vlt [ oi]@xmath66300  line profiles . they were all taken with uves since the hires spectra do not cover this line . in the top four `` uneclipsed '' or `` partially eclipsed '' profiles the superimposed stellar absorption spectrum has been subtracted to minimize it s effects on the profile shape ( see caption for details ) .",
    "the three 2001 profiles have already been published by hamilton et al .  (",
    "2003 ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show 5 h@xmath5  line profiles obtained with uves and hires on various nights during eclipse , which are quite different compared to `` uneclipsed '' profiles ( hamilton et al .  2003 , 2010 ) . in both figures",
    "the given velocity scale is relative to the systemic velocity ( v@xmath14 = 18.6 km  s@xmath15 ) .",
    "the nine [ oi ] profiles displayed in fig .",
    "1 are very similar and only small variations are indicated . in consideration of the night sky and flux calibration uncertainties , and the additional noise in the top four profiles due to the absorption spectrum subtraction , it is unclear , whether the v@xmath16 values and the relative fluxes ( f ) shown in fig .",
    "1 indicate any significant variation .",
    "the only exception is the profile from dec .",
    "20 , 2001 , where the flux tropped by about a factor of 2 ( see sect . 5 for an interpretation ) . in most profiles in fig .",
    "1 two distinct ( but partly blended ) peaks at @xmath1 - 22 km  s@xmath15  and @xmath1 + 25 km  s@xmath15  are visible . on the basis of the three 2001 [ oi ] profiles hamilton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) interpreted them in terms of a bipolar jet in which the two jet components lie close to the plane of the sky resulting in relatively small radial velocities .",
    "the h@xmath5  line profiles obtained during eclipse strengthen this interpretation , since several of them show signatures of bipolar jets similar to the [ oi ] line profile .",
    "a particularly nice example of a double - peaked profile is the middle one in fig .",
    "2 from dec . 16 , 2003 . when comparing the [ oi ] line profiles with the h@xmath5  line profiles it is evident that the former indicate lower velocities for the bipolar jets .",
    "this could be explained by the presence of a blended and unresolved low - velocity component , which is often observed in the fels of cttss , but not in h@xmath5 .",
    "compared to [ oi ] the presented h@xmath5  line profiles indicate considerable variability , particularly in the red jet component ( which is often much fainter than the blue one ) and in the broad h@xmath5line wings .",
    "the data from all of our observing runs ( each run sampling only a small fraction of the orbit ) indicate only small variations on a 1 - 3d timescale for the blueshifted jet component and larger variations only over months to years .",
    "the variations in the broad h@xmath5wings are best illustrated by the unusual profile at the top of fig .",
    "2 , with two additional broad peaks at @xmath1@xmath17100 km  s@xmath15  and wings extending up to @xmath17250 km  s@xmath15 . similarly broad but much fainter wings are visible in all h@xmath5profiles , particularly on the blueshifted side .",
    "the nature of these variable h@xmath5  wings will be discussed in detail by hamilton et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in terms of magnetospheric accretion using all available profiles .    to estimate the full opening angle @xmath5 of the jets and the angle , @xmath18 , between the flow axis and the line of sight we only consider the h@xmath5  line profiles , because the [ oi ] profiles could be blended with an unresolved low - velocity component ( see above ) . for this purpose",
    "we assume that the jets can be approximated by a homogeneously emitting cone .",
    "we will use v@xmath16 and fwhm values of the h@xmath5  profile from dec .",
    "16 , 2003 to derive @xmath18 and @xmath5 from eq .",
    "5 of mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . in this profile",
    "the two peaks are at -30 km  s@xmath15  ( fwhm=39 km  s@xmath15 ) and + 34 km  s@xmath15(fwhm=48 km  s@xmath15 ) . if one assumes a jet velocity , v@xmath19 , of 200 ( 100)km  s@xmath15  one derives @xmath18=81@xmath8(71@xmath8 ) for @xmath20v@xmath16@xmath20=32 km  s@xmath15  and @xmath5 values of 13@xmath8(26@xmath8 ) and 16@xmath8(33@xmath8 ) for the redshifted and blueshifted jets , respectively .",
    "before discussing possible models we like to remind the reader that [ oi]@xmath66300 emission in ttss with small - scale jets is usually extending over 10 - 30au ( e.g. hirth et al .",
    "we call this spatial extend l@xmath21 , which is the length over which most of the light from the jet is emitted .",
    "since the kh15d jet has probably a smaller mass flux than typical cttss l@xmath21 in [ oi ] is more likely 10au than 30au ( see also sect . 5 for an independent estimate of l@xmath21 ) . for v@xmath19=100 km",
    "s@xmath15  it takes 180d to reach 10au .",
    "if one adopts for kh15d such values , even a highly modulated outflow with p@xmath22=48.4d would not cause detectable [ oi ] flux variations , because the [ oi ] emission would be averaged out over @xmath13.7 periods .",
    "although h@xmath5  is probably formed at smaller length scales ( @xmath12 - 5.5au ; see sect .",
    "5 ) it is unlikely that l@xmath21(h@xmath5)/v@xmath19 is much shorter than the binary period and therefore one would expect only a small period modulation of the h@xmath5  flux of the jet component .",
    "these considerations are fully supported by the small [ oi ] flux variations indicated by fig . 1 and the lack of periodic [ oi ] flux and profile variations in the ctts binaries dq tau and uz taue ( basri et al .  1997 , huerta et al.2005 ) .",
    "due to the high excentricity ( @xmath10.6 ) of the kh15d binary system the two stars approach as close as @xmath118r@xmath2 ( r@xmath2=1.3r@xmath3 ) during periastron , i.e. near periastron any individual circumstellar disks must be much smaller than this value due to tidal truncation .",
    "we find it of great astrophysical interest that such a close binary system can launch jets , and it remains as a large theoretical challenge to model such a system , or even closer systems like uz taue . one important guidance for any launching model of the kh15d jets",
    "is the fact that the redshifted and blueshifted jet components in h@xmath5  and [ oi ] show a symmetric velocity shift relative to v@xmath23=+18.6 km  s@xmath15 . in the following we discuss two possible models which could explain this important result . in the first model",
    "the jets are launched from the innermost part of the cbd .",
    "a problem with this idea is the large inferred inner radius of the cbd ( @xmath10.6au ; herbst et al .  2008 ) , since at this radius the cbd is rotating with only v@xmath2445 km  s@xmath15  ( p=145d , 3:1 inner lindblad resonance ) .",
    "magneto - hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. ouyed & pudritz 1997 ; fendt 2006 ) for various magnetic field strengths and magnetic field configurations have shown that jet velocities of v@xmath251 - 1.5v@xmath26 are normal , although v@xmath19@xmath12v@xmath26 is not unusual .",
    "this means that v@xmath19=100 km  s@xmath15  is not implausible and we adopt this value for the cbd launching model .",
    "according to the above @xmath18 calculations a v@xmath19 value of 100 km  s@xmath15  would imply @xmath18=71@xmath8 which is roughly consistent with the inclination angle of the binary system ( @xmath27=83 - 92@xmath8 ) derived by winn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in the context of a specific geometric model of the occulting edge .",
    "better consistency might be achieved by allowing for a possible tilt ( by @xmath110@xmath8 ) between the binary plane and the innermost part of the cbd , provided this tilt is oriented roughly along the line of sight . according to this model binaries with shorter periods should on average have higher jet speeds .",
    "this is in accordance with the [ oi ] line profiles of uz taue and dq tau , in which the edge of their blue wing indicate v@xmath19 @xmath28150 km  s@xmath15  and @xmath28120 km  s@xmath15 , respectively ( huerta et al .  2005 ) .",
    "although the cbd jet launching idea is attractive we also consider the following second model , which produces higher jet speeds .",
    "this model requires that each of the two binary stars launches a magneto - hydrodynamically driven outflow with @xmath1200 km  s@xmath15  from each of the circumstellar disks and that each of these two outflows is of similar mass flux and velocity . at some distance from the system",
    "these two outflows merge to form a common jet .",
    "whether this rather speculative idea would work in the end requires detailed modeling .",
    "one complication is the complex and unstable interaction of the magnetospheres of the two outflows which should lead to reconnection of the magnetic field lines . since in this model",
    "the line widths of the jets should be correlated with the radial orbital motions of the individual circumstellar disks ( with v@xmath16 amplitudes of @xmath1@xmath1750 km  s@xmath15 ) , it has to be shown , whether this model would agree with the small measured velocity widths of the jet components ( fwhm=40 - 50 km  s@xmath15 ) .",
    "this model predicts a periodic modulation of the outflow ( see below ) , which would only be observable with an outflow tracer emitting very close to the source ( i.e. , l@xmath21/v@xmath29 ) .    according to the models of gnther and kley ( 2002 ) binary stars with similar masses should have similar mass accretion rates @xmath30 from their cbds . due to the excentric orbit ( @xmath31@xmath10.6 ) @xmath30 should be highly modulated with the binary period ( @xmath32/@xmath33 @xmath14 - 5 ) and highest near periastron passage . since in ttss @xmath34",
    "is highly correlated with @xmath30 , one would expect for kh15d similar @xmath34 values for the two stars , which should in addition be highest near periastron .",
    "if , quite in contrast to theoretical expectations , only one of the two stars in the system would still drive the jets one would expect a strongly modulated outflow with a higher fractions of the matter ejected near periastron . since at this phase each of the binary members has a rather high v@xmath16 (  @xmath1750 km  s@xmath15  relative to v@xmath23 ) it would be hard to explain why the two jet components are not symmetric about a different velocity , despite the fact that the recorded jet emission traces gas ejected over several orbital periods .",
    "these considerations make it rather unlikely than the jets of kh15d are launched from only one of the two binary stars .",
    "the large variations in the `` eclipsed '' h@xmath5  line profiles and fluxes relative to the much more stable [ oi ] line profiles indicates that these two lines can not be formed in the same region .",
    "most probably the [ oi ] emission traces more distant and tenuous emission .",
    "this may mean that the [ oi ] emission is quenched in the inner and denser h@xmath5  emission region ( i.e. n@xmath35@xmath36n@xmath37@xmath13 ) or that oi is largly ionized there . whether any emission component in our spectra is modulated with the 48.4d period",
    "can not be answered with our data , because of insufficient time sampling .",
    "a jet with 100 km  s@xmath15  would reach a distance of 2.7au within 48.4d and , as already stated above , any periodic modulation in h@xmath5  would only be observable if l@xmath21 in h@xmath5  is much shorter than this value .",
    "the shortest time scale variations of the red jet component have been  observed between dec.14 and 20 , 2001 .",
    "the large flux increase of this component by a factor of 4 within 6d can not be explained by the flux correction uncertainties mentioned in sect .",
    "perhaps they are related to the unique `` accretion event '' which happened on dec.20 , 2001 ( see hamilton et al .",
    "this could have produced sufficient uv radiation to excite more distant neutral sections of the jet causing a corresponding increase in h@xmath5  on a small time scale .",
    "the increased uv flux might have also ionized oi causing the smaller [ oi ] line flux observed on dec.20 , 2001 .",
    "we believe the large variations seen primarly in the redshifted h@xmath5  jet component are mainly a result of obscuration by the disk combined with variation of l@xmath21 . due to variations in the outflow rate , or the above mentioned variations in uv excitation , l@xmath21 for both the blueshifted and redshifted jet will change with time .",
    "if the redshifted jet is obscured by the circumstellar disk over a considerable fraction , l@xmath38 , of its emitting section , then any changes in l@xmath21 will cause corresponding variations .",
    "if we assume that the outer disk radius , r@xmath39 , is at 5au ( see chiang & murray - clay 2004 ) and that the disk plane is inclined towards the line of sight by @xmath5=15  then l@xmath38=sin(@xmath5 ) r@xmath39 @xmath11.3au .",
    "if one assumes l@xmath21(blue)=l@xmath21(red ) and the jet emission rate per unit length is constant , one can derive from the observed flux ratio of f(blue)/f(red)=f@xmath40/f@xmath41 the ratio l@xmath21/l@xmath38=(f@xmath40/f@xmath41)/((f@xmath40/f@xmath41)-1 ) , because f@xmath40/f@xmath41=l@xmath21(blue)/(l@xmath21(red)-l@xmath38 ) . with the measured f@xmath40/f@xmath41 values of @xmath11.3 - 3.2 ( and ignoring the unusual profile of dec .",

    "the average ratio f@xmath40/f@xmath41 is 1.14 . with the above equation one",
