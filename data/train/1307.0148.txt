    "developing optical quantum memories is an important part of quantum optics and quantum information @xcite . in particular , storage and retrieval of single photons",
    "is expected to be necessary for creating scalable linear - optical quantum computers , realizing long - distance quantum key distribution via quantum repeaters and making deterministic single - photon sources .",
    "memory devices which could store single - photon wave - packets with close to 100% efficiency and fidelity , and provide long and controllable storage times and delay - bandwidth products , are demanded for practical quantum information applications .",
    "an efficient storage has been demonstrated recently in gases @xcite ( 87% efficiency ) and rare - earth - ion - doped solids @xcite ( 69% efficiency ) using the gradient echo memory ( gem ) technique @xcite , which is a variant of controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening protocol @xcite .",
    "significant experimental progress has also been achieved in the framework of other approaches based on atomic frequency comb ( afc ) @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , and off - resonant raman interaction @xcite . in particular , 43% @xcite and 78% @xcite were obtained in hot and cold atoms , respectively , using eit , and 56% was achieved using afc in a rare - earth doped crystal placed in a cavity @xcite , a delay - bandwidth product of 2500 was demonstrated for storage of 300-ps pulses using off - resonant raman scheme in a warm atomic vapor @xcite , and a bandwidth of 5  ghz was achieved via afc in a doped waveguide @xcite .",
    "storage and retrieval of an optical pulse is usually accomplished by an appropriate amplitude modulation of the control field or by using inhomogeneous broadening of the resonant transitions . in the first case",
    ", control - field modulation should match the input pulse , while in the second case we need to control atomic frequencies or to create artificial atomic structures . in the present work ,",
    "we develop another approach which requires neither inhomogeneous broadening nor temporal modulation of the control - field amplitude , but resorts to continuous phase - matching control in an extended resonant medium .",
    "we consider off - resonant raman interaction of a single - photon wave packet and a classical control field in a three - level atomic medium . under such conditions the phase - matching control",
    "can be achieved by modulating the refractive index of the resonant medium @xcite or by modulating the direction of propagation of the control field @xcite . in any case , a continuous change of the wave vector of the control field during the interaction leads to the mapping of a single - photon state into a superposition of atomic collective excitations with different wave vectors ( raman spatial coherence grating ) and vice versa .    in comparison with @xcite , where the free - space model of quantum memory was considered , here",
    "we discuss a cavity model .",
    "enclosing an atomic ensemble in a cavity makes it possible to achieve high efficiency of quantum storage with optically thin materials",
    ". this may be especially useful for considered off - resonant raman interactions , since the cross section of the two - photon transition is usually small .",
    "in addition , especially in the case of a transverse control field , reducing linear sizes of the atomic ensemble in a cavity allows one to significantly reduce the power of the control field . on the other hand ,",
    "compared to @xcite , we develop a three - dimensional theory , which allows us to consider storage and retrieval of spatially multimode states containing information not only in the pulse envelope but also in the transverse profile of the field .",
    "the spatial multimode storage is crucially important for multiplexing in quantum repeaters @xcite , which can significantly increase the rate of quantum communication in possession of short - time quantum storage , and for holographic quantum computers @xcite .",
    "it was experimentally demonstrated using eit @xcite and gem @xcite .",
    "the continuous phase - matching approach developed here is closely related to the quantum holographic storage @xcite differing in that control - field angular scanning is used as the only resource for storage and retrieval of a spatial - temporal structure of weak optical pulses .",

    "it should be noted that a standing - wave cavity can also be described in the present model by adding counterpropagating modes of the signal field .",
    "then the case @xmath43 simply means a cavity filled by the atoms .",

    "in addition , we assume that the time of propagation of photons through the system , which may be defined as @xmath45{v}/c$ ] , is negligibly short compared to the evolution time of the slowly time - varying field amplitudes . in particular , @xmath27 is considered as a slowly varying function on the propagation time scale .",

    "the switching of the collective atomic - field interaction from one spin wave to another by a rotated control field is possible in an extended resonant medium due to a phase matching condition . as a result , absorption and emission of the field",
    "is accomplished through reversible mapping of its amplitude into a superposition of the spin waves forming coherence spatial grating . on the other hand , as was shown in @xcite , the off - resonant raman interaction with a rotated transverse control field is mathematically equivalent to gem .",
    "the latter provides the physics of the proposed scheme in the frequency domain .    according to eqs .",

    "we are interested in parallel storage and retrieval of single - photon wave packets that correspond to different transverse modes and have duration @xmath135 smaller than @xmath97 , but larger than @xmath113 . assuming that the cavity field @xmath136 varies slowly during @xmath113 , and @xmath137 , by the end of the storage process from eqs .",
    "( [ a1a ] ) and ( [ a2a ] ) we derive @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the rate of the cavity - assisted collective atomic transition . equation ( [ c ] ) describes the mapping of an input single - photon wave packet corresponding to the @xmath11 mode into a superposition of collective excitations ( spin waves ) with different longitudinal components of wave vectors .",
    "it is valid provided that @xmath140 is much greater than the bandwidth of the input field ( see @xcite for details ) , which corresponds to the bad - cavity limit .",
    "to what extent the value @xmath140 may be reduced with respect to the pulse bandwidth is discussed below in this section .",
    "retrieval is achieved by off - resonant interaction of the atomic system with the control field when the values of @xmath20 that are used for storage are scanned again .",
    "let the control field be applied during the time interval @xmath141 $ ] , when @xmath142 , and the direction of its rotation is reversed . in this case , by solving eq .",
    "( [ a2a ] ) with the initial condition ( [ c ] ) , and using eq .  ( [ in_out ] ) , we obtain @xmath143 the output field becomes a time - reversed replica of the input field provided that the duration of the signal pulse is much smaller than the decay time @xmath144 , and the efficiency of the storage followed by retrieval is maximum under impedance - matching condition @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "thus the less the dispersion of the cavity decay rates @xmath146 , the less the distortion of the retrieved spatial multimode state . in fact , we need diffraction losses to be smaller than those through the partially transmitting mirror .",
    "another important condition for effective multimode storage and retrieval , which was used in obtaining ( [ d ] ) , is @xmath147 .",
    "the time interval @xmath113 in the present scheme plays the same role as reversal inhomogeneous linewidth in photon - echo - based schemes , and in order to effectively store and reconstruct the input pulse , we need the absorption bandwidth to be larger than the input spectrum .",
    "since the latter is determined by both pulse shape and its frequency detuning , not only the amplitude @xmath136 , but also the phase factor @xmath148 should be smooth with respect to @xmath113 .",
    "these features are illustrated in fig .",
    "according to the numerical solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ a1a ] ) and ( [ a2a ] ) , a gaussian pulse with a duration @xmath135 ( full width at half maximum ) as short as @xmath113 or frequency detuning as large as @xmath149 can be stored and recalled with the efficiency 0.99 .",
    "it means that spatial multimode states corresponding to some spectral range of transverse cavity modes can effectively be stored if their duration is shorter than the reversal spectral range of the involved modes .",
    "taking @xmath150 , we find that the minimum angle of the control - field rotation needed for storage of a single pulse with near 100% efficiency is five times larger than the diffraction angle @xmath116 .",
    "this value is the minimum resolvable spot number which should be provided by a beam deflector during the angular scanning .",
    "( color online ) total efficiency of storage followed by retrieval @xmath86 for a gaussian pulse of duration @xmath135 in a transverse mode with a frequency detuning @xmath57 for different values of @xmath113 .",

    "the maximum efficiency is achieved at some optimal ratio between the switching time @xmath113 and the cavity decay rate @xmath146 , namely when @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",
    "the efficiency gradually ( rapidly ) decreases when @xmath146 becomes higher ( smaller ) than the optimal value , and becomes less sensitive to @xmath146 with increasing pulse duration . since the reversal switching time @xmath113 is equivalent to the inhomogeneous linewidth of the atomic transition , this optimal ratio is equivalent to the spectral matching condition discussed in @xcite .",

    "we obtain @xmath162 which means that temporal shape of the pulse is not deformed by the dephasing process .",
    "finally , let us estimate the number of transverse modes which can be stored and recalled simultaneously and the number of pulses which can be stored in a sequence . as was mentioned above , for effective multimode storage the diffraction losses should be much smaller than those through the partially transmitting mirror .",

    "according to the results of numerical simulations presented above , high storage efficiency is achieved provided that @xmath163 , which means that the cavity modes may be nondegenerate but should be nonresolvable in the frequency domain . from this point of view , confocal cavities seem to be the optimal ones . in this case",
    ", the diffraction losses per round trip can be estimated by @xcite @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 is the cavity fresnel number .",
    "if we take the mirror transmittance of 0.1% , thereby requiring @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , then the maximum value of the transverse indexes proves to be about 30 , and the total number of accessible transverse modes approaches @xmath169 .",
    "storage of such a multimode transverse field can be combined with that of the multimode longitudinal profile , i.e. , with storage of a complicated pulse shape or a sequence of pulses . from eq .",
    "( [ maincondition ] ) , taking @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and requiring the left - hand side to be an order larger than the right - hand side , for @xmath172 we obtain @xmath173 .",
    "such an angular scanning range allows one to store about 100 of the pulses in a sequence , depending on the minimum value of rotation angle per pulse @xmath174 .",
    "thus we can predict a large storage capacity for the proposed memory scheme .",
    "quantum storage based on off - resonant raman interaction has been successfully demonstrated in warm atomic vapors of @xmath175 atoms @xcite and @xmath176 atoms @xcite . in such media , the broadening of the two - photon spin transition due to the thermal motion of atoms",
    "can be minimized by working in collinear geometry ( when control and signal fields are copropagating ) and by restriction the motion of atoms using a buffer gas .",
    "increasing the angle between the control and signal fields leads to significant residual doppler broadening .",
    "in addition , a small spatial period of coherence grating in the case of non - collinear excitation makes the storage process more sensitive to the diffusion of the atoms .",
    "therefore , an ensemble of cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice or impurity atoms in a solid - state material seem to be the most promising storage media for the present memory scheme . in this section",
    ", we discuss the possibility of implementation of the proposed scheme in solids .",
    "one promising candidate  an ensemble of defect centers in diamond such as nitrogen - vacancy centers  was discussed already in @xcite . here",
    "we focus on materials with much weaker optical transitions , namely , crystals doped by rare - earth ions , thereby making use of the advantages of cavity - assisted interactions .    as an example , we consider low - strain crystals @xmath177 or @xmath178 doped by @xmath179 ions .",
    "in particular , an isotopically pure crystal of @xmath177 ( when only @xmath180 is present ) demonstrates an extremely narrow inhomogeneous linewidth ( as low as 15  mhz at 0.005 at.% ) for optical transitions of @xmath179 ions @xcite .",

    "for @xmath191 we need @xmath192 , which corresponds to the intensity of the control field @xmath193 . considering a standing - wave cavity , we can take @xmath194 , and a control - field beam of 2.5  mm diameter .",
    "then we need the transmittance of the output cavity mirror of 0.5% , and the control - field power about 1.6  w. such a regime can be realized with commercial cw fiber lasers .",
