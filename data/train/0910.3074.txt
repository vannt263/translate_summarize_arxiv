    "the number of known supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the galaxy has increased significantly over the last few years , mainly due to a new generation of radio and x - ray  instruments of unprecedented sensitivities and angular resolutions . in particular , these observations , combined with galactic plane surveys @xcite , and targeted observations @xcite have increased the fraction of snrs found to harbor an energetic pulsar powering a wind nebula ( the so - called composite snrs ) . moreover ,",
    "deep observations toward compact pwne have proven to be successful in detecting their powering pulsars @xcite , providing constraints on their energetics , spin evolution , and birth parameters . along with the current generation of high / very - high energy ( vhe ; @xmath21 100  @xmath22 ) instruments ,",

    "<S> we report the discovery of 31.18  @xmath0 pulsations from the _ integral _  source igr  j14003@xmath16326  using the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> this pulsar is most likely associated with the bright chandra x - ray  point source lying at the center of g310.6@xmath11.6 , a previously unrecognised galactic composite supernova remnant with a bright central non - thermal radio and x - ray  nebula , taken to be the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) . </S>",
    "<S> psr  j1400@xmath16325  is amongst the most energetic rotation - powered pulsars in the galaxy , with a spin - down luminosity of @xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 . in the rotating dipole model , </S>",
    "<S> the surface dipole magnetic field strength is @xmath4  g and the characteristic age @xmath5  kyr . </S>",
    "<S> the high spin - down power is consistent with the hard spectral indices of the pulsar and the nebula of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and a 210  @xmath8 flux ratio @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up parkes observations resulted in the detection of radio emission at 10 and 20  @xmath10 from psr  j1400@xmath16325  at a dispersion measure of @xmath11 560 @xmath12 pc , which implies a relatively large distance of 10 @xmath13 3  @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the resulting location off the galactic plane of @xmath11 280  @xmath15 would be much larger than the typical thickness of the molecular disk , and we argue that g310.6@xmath11.6  lies at a distance of @xmath11 7  @xmath14 . there is no gamma - ray counterpart to the nebula or pulsar in the fermi data published so far . </S>",
    "<S> a multi - wavelength study of this new composite supernova remnant , from radio to very - high energy gamma - rays , suggests a young ( @xmath16 10@xmath17 yr ) system , formed by a sub - energetic ( @xmath18 ergs ) , low ejecta mass ( m@xmath19 ) sn explosion that occurred in a low - density environment ( @xmath20 0.01 @xmath12 ) . </S>"
