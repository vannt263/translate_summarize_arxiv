    "for more than ten years , attention has been paid to the 2 + 1 dimensional gravity @xcite@xcite@xcite as a useful toy model which gives insights into the 3 + 1 dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "the pure einstein gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions is described by a finite number of global degrees of freedom ; no local degrees of freedom , the graviton , appear .",
    "this is because einstein s equations without matter tell us that the spacetime should be locally diffeomorphic to a de sitter , the minkowski , or an anti - de sitter space according as the cosmological constant is positive , zero , or negative .",
    "dynamics in 2 + 1 dimensions is therefore much easier to deal with than that in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "in addition , the 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity shares with the 3 + 1 dimensional gravity the propeties which lead to difficulties in quantizing the latter .",
    "these are for example the facts that it is generally covariant under diffeomorphisms and that it is not renormalizable when we use metrics as basic variables . for these reasons",
    "we expect that the study of the 2 + 1 dimensional quantum gravity yields some lessons in quantizing the gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "it has been shown by witten that the first order form of the 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity whose cosmological constant is positive , zero , or negative is equivalent respectively to an @xmath3 , an @xmath4 , or an @xmath5 gauge theory described by the chern - simons action @xcite .",
    "we call it `` chern - simons gravity '' ( csg ) .",
    "many works have been done about the csg , which mainly focus on algebras of operators @xcite @xcite @xcite and on topological information that can be extracted by path integrals @xcite@xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the adm formalism in 2 + 1 dimensions have been given by moncrief @xcite in the case of zero cosmological constant . while the quantization is given when the genus of the time - slice is one @xcite , it is hard to get its physical interpretation .",
    "classical and quantum relations between the csg and the adm are investigated by carlip @xcite and others @xcite@xcite mainly in the torus case . from these works",
    "some geometrical aspects of the 2 + 1 dimensional quantum gravity seem to be revealed .",
    "the results obtained so far are mostly on the pure einstein gravity with zero cosmological constant , which describes the world with no matter effects .",
    "what attracts our interest finally would be the universe with some matter fields .",
    "one of the simplest ways to consider matter effects is to introduce a cosmological term .",
    "there appear to be relatively few works @xcite which deal with the case with nonvanishing cosmological constant from the viewpoint of the canonical formalism .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the pure einstein gravity with nonzero cosmological constant putting an emphasis on geometrical aspects .",
    "our discussion is based on the canonical formalism and therefore the topology of the spacetime is restricted to @xmath6 .",
    "we further assume that the time - slice @xmath7 is a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath8 .",
    "moncrief s procedure for reducing the adm formalism @xcite is extended to the nonzero cosmological constant case . in the @xmath9 and @xmath2 cases",
    "we explicitly observe that the spacetimes constructed by means of the csg are almost the same as those given by the adm .",
    "the relations between the csg and the adm are shown to be given in a way similar to that in the zero cosmological constant case , with a few modifications .",
    "in particular for @xmath10 and @xmath2 , the correspondence between the phase spaces of the csg and of the adm is shown to be 1 to 2 .",
    "this is one of the main results in this paper and gives an implication that the csg gives a `` tunneling solution '' similar to the one obtained by using ashtekar s formalism @xcite@xcite .    in  2",
    "we apply moncrief s method to the positive cosmological constant case , and use the result to see a classical evolution of the torus universe . in  3 after briefly reviewing the csg , we look into the torus case in detail . based on the results of  2 and  3 ,",
    "classical and quantum relations between the adm formalism and the csg are given in  4 .",
    " 5 is devoted to the study of special solutions in the @xmath2 case .",
    "the @xmath9 case is investigated in  6 .",
    "similar discussions are applicable to the anti - de sitter case .",
    "we give an outline for this case in  7 . in  8 , after summarizing our results , we discuss remaining issues .    here",

    "+ however in practice , we meet various obstructions to carry out this program . indeed for the @xmath65 case , where we know that a unique solution @xmath60 for eq.([eq : ellip ] ) exists under the proper condition , the explicit form of the solution @xmath60 and hence that of the hamiltonian @xmath86 are not known @xcite .",
    "it seems almost impossible to give a time evolution of the teichmller parameters of the riemann surface with @xmath65 .",

    ". we can express this metric using the teichmller parameters as @xmath104 where @xmath105 are coordinates on @xmath1 with period 1 .",

    "we parametrize the points on @xmath101 as follows : @xmath127 these points satisfy @xmath128 which imply that they are in a particular subspace of @xmath101 ( figure 2a ) .",

    "identifies @xmath132 and @xmath133 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively , such identification does not appear in the original periodicity ( [ eq : period ] ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider that the spacetime we have obtained by means of adm is actually the quotient space of _ the universal covering space of _ the de sitter space @xmath101 : ( [ eq : embed ] ) with @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , modulo the identification ( [ eq : period ] ) . and those with @xmath137 , we have to cut the submanifold([eq : embed ] ) of @xmath101 along e.g. the surface @xmath138 , patch its infinitely many copies along that surface , and form the universal covering of the submanifold . ]",
    "this identification belongs to the universal covering @xmath139 of the isometry group of @xmath101 .",
    "such prescription is indeed possible .",
    "if we consider the whole de sitter space as in ref.@xcite , the similar identification occurs when the antipodal singularities exist on the time - slice which originally have the topology of a sphere @xmath0 . in our case , since the topology of the time - slice of the primitive space is a cylinder @xmath140 ( fig.2b ) , such singularities are prepared at the outset .",
    "thus we have no problem in carrying out the operation mentioned above .",
    "there is another advantage in using the universal covering space .",
    "for illustration we consider identifying by @xmath141 with @xmath142 , which represents a pure rotation in the @xmath143-plane .",
    "if we use as a fundamental region the de sitter space([eq : embed ] ) as it is , then the result of the identification by @xmath141 generically , more precisely when @xmath144 is irrational , collapses to a singularity since the @xmath145-direction originally forms a circle @xmath146 . on the other hand , use of the universal covering avoids such a singularity because the @xmath145- direction originally has the topology @xmath147 .    to summarize , as a result of solving the hamilton equations of the reduced adm formalism in the case of @xmath29 , we constructed the spacetime .",
    "it is the quotient space : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the fundamental region , which is the universal covering of the subspace ( [ eq : embed ] ) of the de sitter space @xmath101 , and @xmath150 is the group generated by two identifications in ( [ eq : period ] ) .",
    "note that this @xmath150 is a subgroup of the universal covering of the de sitter group @xmath139 .",
    "finally we make a few remarks on the geometrical feature of the time - slice : i ) it is intrinsically flat because the time - slice of the primitive space has the geometry of a cylinder @xmath151 with all @xmath146 having the same radius ; and ii ) its evolution is considerably different from that in the @xmath152 case .",
    "the time - slice expands exponentially from a wire - like singularity while twisting and its shape approaches to a _",
    "nonsingular _ torus in the ( @xmath153)-limit .",
