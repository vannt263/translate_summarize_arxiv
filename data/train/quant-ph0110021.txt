    "active systems are fundamental elements in high precision measurements . amplifiers are used either for amplifying the signal to a macroscopic level or to make the system work around its optimal working point with the help of feedback loops . with techniques such as cold damping , it is possible to manipulate actively the fluctuations and to reduce the effective noise temperature of the devices well below the operating temperature .",
    "the analysis of sensitivity limits in these devices rises many questions related to fundamental processes as well as experimental constraints .",
    "how far is it possible to reduce the measurement temperature ? how are these process related to the fluctuation dissipation theorem ? are there quantum limits to this noise reduction associated with heisenberg inequalities ?",
    "how do the experimental constraints interplay with the fundamental limitations of the sensitivity ?",

    "@xcite , @xmath85 appears as the back - action field sent back to the monitored system and @xmath86 represents the fluctuations coming from the readout line .",
    "a reactive impedance @xmath87 acts as feedback for the amplifier .",
    "we now present the electrical equations associated with this measurement device .",
    "we first write the characteristic relations between the voltages and currents @xmath88 here , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the voltage and current at the port @xmath91 , i.e. at the end of the line @xmath92 or @xmath82 , while @xmath80 and @xmath7 are the voltage and current noise generators associated with the operational amplifier itself ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "@xmath87 is the impedance feedback .",
    "all equations are implicitly written in the frequency representation and the impedances are functions of frequency .",
    "equations ( [ amplifier ] ) take a simple form because of the limits of infinite gain , infinite input impedance and null output impedance assumed for the ideal operational amplifier .",
    "we also suppose that the fields incoming through the various ports are uncorrelated with each other as well as with amplifier noises .",
    "as already emphasized , the output fields @xmath93 obey the commutation relations ( [ commutfree ] ) of free fields . to make this property explicit",
    ", we use the characteristic equations ( [ amplifier],[defnyquist ] ) associated with the amplifier and the lines to rewrite the output fields @xmath85 and @xmath84 in terms of input fields @xmath94 , @xmath86 and of amplifier noise sources @xmath80 and @xmath7 @xmath95 we then deduce from ( [ inout ] ) that the voltage and current fluctuations @xmath96 and @xmath7 obey the following commutation relations @xmath97 , u\\left [ \\omega ^{\\prime } \\right ] \\right ]   & = & % \\left [ i\\left [ \\omega \\right ] , i\\left [ \\omega ^{\\prime } \\right ] \\right ] = 0   \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ u\\left [ \\omega \\right ] , i\\left [ \\omega ^{\\prime } \\right ] \\right ]   & = & 2\\pi \\ \\hbar \\omega \\ \\delta \\left ( \\omega + \\omega ^{\\prime } \\right )   \\label{uu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , voltage and current fluctuations verify heisenberg inequalities which determine the ultimate performance of the ideal operational amplifier used as a measurement device @xcite .    to push this analysis",
    "further it is worth introducing new quantities @xmath98 and @xmath99 as linear combinations of the noises @xmath80 and @xmath7 depending on a factor @xmath5 having the dimension of an impedance    @xmath100 & = & \\sqrt{2\\hbar \\left| \\omega \\right| r}\\left ( a^{% { \\rm in}}\\left [ \\omega \\right ] -a^{\\prime { \\rm in}}\\left [ -\\omega \\right ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ i\\left [ \\omega \\right ] & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\hbar \\left| \\omega \\right| } { r}}% \\left ( a^{{\\rm in}}\\left [ \\omega \\right ] + a^{\\prime { \\rm in}}\\left [ -\\omega % \\right ] \\right )   \\label{deflignes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for an arbitrary value of @xmath5 , the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath101 satisfy the free field commutation relations . in other words , the voltage and current noises associated with the amplifier may be replaced by the coupling to @xmath42 further lines @xmath102 and @xmath103 and the presence of amplification requires a conjugation of fluctuations coming in one of these two lines . this representation of the amplifier as a quantum network is depicted on figure [ figure3]b .",
    "we may then fix the parameter @xmath5 to a value @xmath104 chosen so that the fluctuations @xmath22 and @xmath99 are uncorrelated .",
    "this specific value is determined by the ratio between voltage and current noise spectra @xmath105 the @xmath42 noise spectra @xmath106 and @xmath107 are defined as symmetric correlation functions .",
    "the fields @xmath22 and @xmath101 are thus described by temperatures @xmath34 and @xmath108 .",
    "we have assumed that these fluctuations are the same for all field quadratures , i.e. that the amplifier noises are phase - insensitive .",
    "although this assumption is not mandatory for the forthcoming analysis , we also consider for simplicity that the specific impedance @xmath104 is constant over the spectral domain of interest .",
    "we come to the discussion of the ultimate performance of the cold damped capacitive accelerometer designed for fundamental physics experiments in space @xcite .",
    "the central element of the capacitive accelerometer is a parallelepipedic proof mass placed inside a box .",
    "the walls of these box are electrodes distant from the mass off a hundred micrometers .",
    "the proof mass is kept at the center of the cage by an electrostatic suspension . since",
    "a three dimensional electrostatic suspension is instable , it is necessary to use an active suspension .    in the cage reference frame ,",
    "an acceleration is transformed in an inertial force acting on the proof mass .",
    "the force necessary to compensate this inertial force is measured .",
    "in fact , as in most ultrasensitive measurements , the detected signal is the error signal used to compensate the effect of the measured phenomenon .",
    "the essential elements of the accelerometer are presented in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "the proof mass and the cage form two condensators .",
    "any mass motion unbalances the differential detection bridge and provides the error signal . in order to avoid low frequency electrical noise ,",
    "the electrical circuit is polarized with an ac  voltage with a frequency of a hundred kilohertz .",
    "after demodulation , this signal is used for detection and as an error signal for a servo control loop which allows to keep the mass centered in its cage .",
    "furthermore , the derivative of this signal provides a force proportional to the mass velocity and simulates a friction force .",
    "this active friction is called cold damping since it may be noiseless .",
    "more precisely , the effective temperature of the fluctuations of this active friction is much lower than the physical temperature of the device .",
    "the detection is performed with the output detection signal @xmath109 .",
    "it is a linear combination of the external force @xmath110 and of input fields in the various noise lines .",
    "we normalize this expression so that the coefficient of proportionality appearing in front of the external force @xmath111 is reduced to unity . with this normalization",
    ", we obtain a force estimator @xmath112 which is just the sum of the true force @xmath111 to be measured and of an equivalent input force noise . in the absence of feedback ,",
    "the force estimator reads @xcite : @xmath113 where @xmath114 denote the various input fields corresponding to the active and passive elements in the accelerometer .",
    "when the feedback is active , the servo loop efficiently maintains the mass at its equilibrium position and the velocity is no longer affected by the external force @xmath110 .",
    "the residual motion is interpreted as the difference between the real velocity of the mass and the velocity measured by the sensor .",
    "this means that the servo loop efficiently corrects the motion of the mass except for the sensing error .",
    "however the sensitivity to external force is still present in the correction signal .",
    "quite remarkably , in the limit of an infinite loop gain and with the same approximations as above , the expression of the force estimator @xmath112 is the same as in the free case @xcite .    the added noise spectrum @xmath115 is obtained as @xmath116 we have evaluated the whole noise spectrum @xmath115 for the specific case of the instrument proposed for the @xmath117scope space mission devoted to the test of the equivalence principle .",
    "some of the main parameters of this system are listed below @xmath118 @xmath119 is the mass of the proof mass , @xmath120 is the residual mechanical damping force , @xmath121 is the frequency of the measured mechanical motion , @xmath122 is the operating frequency of the electrical detection circuit . @xmath104 and @xmath36 are the characteristic impedance and temperature of the amplifier .    in these conditions , the added noise spectrum is dominated by the mechanical langevin forces @xmath123 this corresponds to a sensitivity in acceleration @xmath124 taking into account the integration time of the experiment , this leads to the expected instrument performance corresponding to a test accuracy of @xmath125 .    in the present state - of - the - art instrument",
    ", the sensitivity is thus limited by the residual mechanical langevin forces .",
    "the latter are due to the damping processes in the gold wire used to keep the proof mass at zero voltage @xcite .",
    "with such a configuration , the detection noise is not a limiting factor .",
    "this is a remarkable result in a situation where the effective damping induced through the servo loop is much more efficient than the passive mechanical damping .",
    "this confirms the considerable interest of the cold damping technique for high sensitivity measurement devices .",
    "future fundamental physics missions in space will require even better sensitivities .",
    "to this aim , the wire will be removed and the charge of the test mass will be controlled by other means , for example uv photoemission .",
    "the mechanical langevin noise will no longer be a limitation so that the analysis of the ultimate detection noise will become crucial for the optimization of the instrument performance .",
    "this also means that the electromechanical design configuration will have to be reoptimized taking into account the various noise sources associated with detection @xcite ."
