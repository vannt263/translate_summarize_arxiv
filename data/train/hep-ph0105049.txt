    "rare b decays , which proceed via loop effects , are important venues for observing the signals of new physics beyond the standard model",
    ". heavy exotic particles , which are not accessible to experiments at present or near future accelerators , can occur in quantum loops as virtual particles , and therefore , be detected indirectly .",
    "b factories , cleo iii and other dedicated b experiments are expected to observe new rare b decay channels and to improve the precision of those which have already been measured . as a result , by using experimental data on radiative rare b decays , one should be able to constrain the parameters of new physics better than before .",
    "one simple extension of the sm is obtained by adding an extra generation of iso - singlet quarks@xcite .",
    "there are various motivations for this model : down - type vector - like quarks are predicted by certain grand unified theories like @xmath8 in four dimensions , which is inspired by superstring @xmath9 model in ten dimensions .",
    "also , it has been shown that heavy quarks should be vector - like if the vacuum is to be stable perturbatively@xcite .",
    "the presence of these iso - singlet quarks leads to non - unitarity of the quark mixing matrix and consequently , results in nonvanishing flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at the tree level . on the other hand",
    ", the existence of the extra heavy quarks necessitates the modification of the wilson coefficients of the operators entering the effective hamiltonian for rare decays of k and b mesons@xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the effects of adding an extra iso - singlet pair of quarks , @xmath10 and @xmath2 with charges @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , to the sm on the inclusive rare dileptonic b decays @xmath0 . using the experimental upper bound of the branching ratio",
    ", one can constrain the acceptable range of the model parameters . however",
    ", it is shown that the shapes of the differential branching ratio and forward - backward asymmetry distribution is still quite sensitive to these parameters in their restricted domain .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the direct cp asymmetry distribution associated with @xmath0 assuming that the imaginary parts of the @xmath13 continuum and resonance contributions are the only sources of the strong phase .",
    "our results indicate that the size of the cp asymmetry , which is vanishingly small in the sm and very sensitive to the model parameters in vqm , can reach up to 10% for certain dilepton invariant mass values .",
    "in this model , the gauge structure of the sm remains intact except for an additional pair of iso - singlet quarks , which we denote them by @xmath10 and @xmath2 , as mentioned before .",
    "the difference between these new quarks and ordinary quarks of the three sm generations is that , unlike the latter ones , both left- and right - handed components of the former quarks are @xmath14 singlets .",
    "therefore , the dirac mass terms of vector - like quarks , i.e. @xmath15 are invariant under electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "however , the masses of the ordinary quarks arise from their gauge invariant yukawa couplings to an iso - doublet scalar higgs field @xmath16 as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is covering the three generations of the regular quarks , and the doublet of fermions @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 at the same time , additional @xmath14 invariant yukawa couplings between vector - like and ordinary quarks , in the form @xmath21 leads to mixing among 4 up- and down - type quarks of the same charge . as a result , after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking due to @xmath22 , we obtain the following mass terms : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 being @xmath26 mass matrices and @xmath27 cover ordinary and vector - like quarks . in general , the mass matrices are not diagonal and unitary transformations from weak to mass eigenstates are necessary to achieve diagonalization . denoting the mass eigenstates with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 where the unitary transformation matrices @xmath31 are chosen such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are diagonal .",
    "the interesting property of the vqm is that the transformations ( 6 ) lead to inter - generational mixing among quarks not only in the charged current sector but also in the neutral current interactions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the extra iso - singlet quarks carry zero weak isospin and thus , are not involved in @xmath14 interactions as weak eigenstates .",
    "for example , the charge current interaction term @xmath34 transforms to @xmath35 where @xmath36 when expressed in terms of mass eigenstates via eqn .",
    "@xmath3 is the @xmath26 generalization of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm)@xcite quark mixing matrix .",
    "the fact that the forth generation is iso - singlet , i.e. @xmath37 , leads to non - unitarity of the mixing matrix @xmath3 as demonstrated in the following : @xmath38}^*{({a^u_l}^{j\\delta})}^*{a^d_l}^{j\\beta } \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\sum_{i , j=1}^3{({a^d_l}^{i\\alpha})}^*{a^d_l}^{j\\beta}\\sum_{\\delta = 1}^4{({a^u_l}^{j\\delta})}^ * { a^u_l}^{i\\delta } \\\\ & = & \\sum_{i=1}^3{({a^d_l}^{i\\alpha})}^*{a^d_l}^{i\\beta}=\\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}-{({a_l^d}^{4\\alpha})}^*{a_l^d}^{4\\beta}\\;\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in obtaining the last line in ( 10 ) , the unitarity of the tranformation matrix @xmath39 has been utilized . in the same way , one can show @xmath40 equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , together with the unitarity of @xmath41 , indicate that the quark mixing matrix @xmath3 _ can not _ be unitary .",
    "this property of the vqm has interesting consequences in the neutral current sector where non - vanishing tree level fcnc , proportional to the deviation of the quark mixing matrix ( 9 ) from unitarity , are generated . to demonstrate this explicitly ,",
    "let us examine the neutral current which is coupled to @xmath42 boson @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath45 . the first term in ( 12 ) is proportional to @xmath46 , the third component of the isospin , which has the value @xmath47 or @xmath48 for the up- or down - type quarks , respectively .",
    "consequently , the iso - singlet quarks , which have zero isospin , _ do not _ contribute to this term . as a result , under the transformations ( 6 ) , the neutral current ( 12 ) can be expressed in terms of the mass eigenstates as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 we observe that the non - unitarity of the mixing matrix @xmath3 in the vqm leads to the tree level fcnc in the @xmath51 sector .",
    "in fact , this property is valid for the neutral currents involving the scalar partner of @xmath51 and the higgs bozon as well . on the other hand , the same non - unitarity parameters @xmath52 ) of eqns .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) appear at the one - loop level fcnc as multiplicative factors for terms which are independent of the internal quark mass .",
    "these terms are absent in sm where ckm quark mixing matrix is unitary .",
    "one can use the existing experimental data to constrain various elements of @xmath10 . in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with @xmath53 which appears in rare fcnc @xmath4 transitions .",
    "in particular , we investigate the shift in the differential branching ratio and total branching ratio , forward - backward and cp asymmetries of the inclusive dileptonic b decays due to the presence of the extra vector - like quarks .",
    "the experimental upper bound on the branching ratio of the @xmath54 decay is used to constrain @xmath53 and other vqm parameters as is explained in the next section .",
    "the low - energy effective lagrangian for @xmath0 can be written as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 is the mass of the @xmath59-quark and @xmath45 is the total momentum of the @xmath60 pair .",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 receive long - distance ( ld ) contributions from dynamical quark loops and intermediate resonances as well as short - distance ( sd ) contributions at the tree and one loop level .",
    "@xmath63 is the coefficient of the sd magnetic moment operator . in the vqm , the tree level fcnc diagram of fig .",
    "1(a ) leads to the following result : @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the weak angle ) . on the other hand , the box diagram ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) contributes to @xmath67 only , as it is purely @xmath68 : @xmath69 the effective vertex function @xmath70 ( subscript `` 0 '' indicates that qcd corrections are not included ) , where @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the mass of the virtual quark in the loop , has the following expression @xcite : @xmath73 \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ]    in the sm with the ckm quark mixing picture , due to unitarity , the constant term in the effective vertex functions like @xmath74 , when summed over all three generations , adds up to zero , and therefore , is usually omitted .",
    "however , in the vqm at one loop order , such constant terms make contributions proportional to the non - unitarity parameter @xmath53 , and thus , their significance depends on the specific process which is under investigation . for example , in the radiative @xmath75 decay process , where a tree level fcnc like fig .",
    "1(a ) is absent , the above mentioned non - unitarity contributions are quite crucial @xcite . for the dileptonic @xmath0 process however , the dominant non - unitarity @xmath53 effect appears at the tree level ( eq . ( 18 ) ) , compared to which the above mentioned contributions are suppressed by a factor @xmath76 , and thus , can be safely ignored at the leading order .",
    "photon- and z - penguin diagrams ( figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) ) also contribute to @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "figure 1(c ) consists of the usual sm diagrams due to w and its unphysical higgs partner exchange that now include an extra virtual up - type quark insertion in the loop as well . on the other hand ,",
    "1(d ) illustrates penguin diagrams via z , its unphysical scalar higgs partner and physical higgs exchange , which are peculiar to the vqm . due to the property @xmath77",
    ", these latter diagrams can all be shown to be proportional to @xmath53 , and therefore , are subleading as compared to the tree level fcnc contribution .",
    "consequently , one has : @xmath78\\;\\ ; , \\\\",
    "b^{sd}_{1(c)}&=&-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\sum_{\\beta = 1}^4v^*_{\\beta s}v_{\\beta b}\\left [ \\frac{1}{4}d_0(x_\\beta ) + c_0(x_\\beta ) \\right ] \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective photon and z vertex functions are defined as : @xmath79\\;\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this point , an explanation is in order .",
    "the z - penguin diagram in the vqm has a divergent term that is absent in the sm due to the unitarity of the quark mixing matrix which is no longer applicable here .",
    "however , this divergence is removed by renormalizing the tree level fcnc which exists in the vqm lagrangian .",
    "therefore , the effective vertex function @xmath80 is renormalization scheme dependent and the expression given in eqn .",
    "( 22 ) is in fact , in @xmath81 scheme .",
    "however , due to the reason which was pointed out after eqn .",
    "( 20 ) , this scheme dependence is not relevant for the dileptonic decay process at hand , where , compared to the tree level , the contribution of a one - loop - level constant term is subleading .",

    "( 26 ) as a phenomenological parameter whose magnitude @xmath95 can be determined from the data on the semi - inclusive @xmath96@xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 continuum contribution is obtained from joining the @xmath97 and @xmath98 legs of the four - fermi operators in ( 27)@xcite : @xmath99 where @xmath100 ( @xmath45 the total momentum of the dileptons ) and @xmath101 on the other hand , the resonance contributions from @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be incorporated by using a breit - wigner form for the resonance propagator@xcite : @xmath102 @xmath103 is the decay constant of the vector meson , which is defined as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the polarization vector . @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the mass and the total decay width of @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "in fact , the total branching ratio of @xmath0 is dominated by these two resonances . however , by using some appropriate cuts around the resonances in the differential branching ratio , one can get information on the contributing sd physics without any significant interference from the ld sector@xcite .",
    "the fact that there are various observable distributions associated with the dileptonic rare b decays makes these processes excellent venues for examining relevant sd operators within the sm and beyond .",
    "by inserting the coefficients @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath63 , which are obtained from eqns .",
    "( 23 ) , ( 24 ) and ( 26 ) , into the effective lagrangian ( 15 ) , one can calculate various observables of the decay mode @xmath0 .",

    "the vqm parameters appearing in ( 32 ) are the following : the u - quark mass @xmath6 , the non - unitarity parameter @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a weak phase , and @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 , which is our notation for the @xmath118 submatrix of the matrix @xmath3 , consists of the elements representing mixing among three ordinary generations of quarks .",
    "therefore , @xmath119 , which is zero in the sm , gives a measure of the deviation from unitarity of the 3-generation ckm mixing matrix in the vqm context .",
    "using the experimental upper bound @xmath120@xcite , and assuming the dominance of the tree level contribution ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , one can extract the following rough constraint on the magnitude of @xmath53 : @xmath121 in this work , by taking the above upper limit as a guide , we include all leading contributing factors to the dileptonic rare b decay process in obtaining constraints on the vqm model parameters . as we pointed out before , due to the tree level @xmath53 contribution to the above decay channels , the terms proportional to @xmath122 , which appear at the one - loop order , are significant only if @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , having this condition in mind , we parametrize our results in terms of @xmath124 instead of @xmath122 , where @xmath125 and @xmath16 is another weak phase of the model .    as for the numerical values of the ordinary ckm matrix elements , we use @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128@xcite , which are extracted from various experimental measurements and are not affected by the presence of the new physics .",
    "we take @xmath129 and assume @xmath130 to be real , as is the case , to a good accuracy , in the `` standard '' parametrization of the ckm matrix . as a result , @xmath131 , which is not known experimentally ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of the vqm parameters as : @xmath132    in figure 2 , the differential branching ratio ( 32 ) for some values of the vqm parameters is campared to the sm prediction . to illustrate the effect of various interfering factors , we use @xmath133 and all constructive / destructive contribution possibilities of the extra beyond the sm terms ] .",
    "we observe that away from the resonances , where sd operators are dominant , the shift from the sm expectation , depending on the parameter values , can be quite significant .",
    "for example , if @xmath115 and @xmath16 are both zero , fig .",
    "2(a ) indicates a significant sensitivity of the differential branching ratio to both the non - unitarity parameter @xmath53 and the vector - like up quark mass @xmath6 .",
    "figures 2(b ) , 2(c ) and 2(d ) illustrate a reduced sensitivity to these parameters when the new terms generated by the additional quarks enter the effective lagrangian with a non - vanishing phase . at the same time",
    ", the variation of the differential branching ratio with the invariant mass of the dileptons is appreciably larger than that of the pure sm graph and follows the above - mentioned trend with respect to the relative phase of the extra contributions .    to constrain the model parameters by using the experimental results on @xmath7 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the total branching ratio by integrating ( 23 ) over all the available range of the dileptonic invariant mass but excluding the resonances @xmath86 and @xmath87 with a @xmath134 cut .",
    "our results are depicted in fig . 3 in the form of acceptable regions in the @xmath135 versus @xmath6 plane for various choices of the relative sign of the extra contributions .",
    "as is expected , the most stringent constraint is obtained if the relative phases @xmath115 and @xmath16 both vanish ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) . in this case ,",
    "absolute upper bounds @xmath136 and @xmath137 can be inferred for these model parameters . these limits",
    "become stronger if a larger value for @xmath138 is used .",
    "figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) show that , if the extra tree and penguin contributions have positive relative sign , the experimental bound leads to a lower limit for @xmath6 for larger values of the non - unitarity parameter @xmath53 .",
    "a less stronger upper bounds on these parameters are resulted when @xmath115 and @xmath16 are both non - zero ( fig .",
    "3(d ) ) .    besides the differential and total branching ratios",
    ", there are other physical observables associated with the dileptonic rare b decays which can provide crucial information on the contributing amplitudes and their relative phases . among them",
    "are the forward - backward and the cp asymmetry distributions , which we investigate in the presence of the extra vector - like quarks .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry distribution is defined as : @xmath139 where @xmath140 , with @xmath141 being the angle between the momentum of the ingoing b meson ( or the outgoing s quark ) and that of @xmath142 in the center of mass frame of the dileptons . using the effective lagrangian ( 15 ) , a simple form for this asymmetry in the @xmath143 limit is obtained@xcite : @xmath144}}{\\left ( { \\vert a\\vert}^2+{\\vert b\\vert}^2\\right ) ( 1 + 2z)+2{\\vert c\\vert}^2(1 + 2/z)+6\\re{\\left [ ( a+b)^*c\\right ] } } \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] figure 4 illustrates our results for the forward - backward asymmetry distribution of the decay @xmath145 in the vqm as compared to the sm . from fig .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) we observe that , when the tree level fcnc contribute constructively , even though the sign of the asymmetry remains the same as in the sm , its shape , away from the resonances , can be significantly different . on the other hand , as is shown in figs .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) , for the destructive contribution of the non - unitarity induced tree level term and large enough values of @xmath135 or @xmath6 , the sign of @xmath146 can be opposite to what is predicted by the sm .",
    "one important observable in this decay channel is the point of zero asymmetry in the forward - backward asymmetry distribution , which occurs somewhere below the resonance @xmath86 .",
    "our investigation reveals that , as far as the vqm is concered , the position of this point is quite stable and is not shifted very much from its sm value for various choices of the model parameters .",
    "the cp asymmetry distribution is defined as : @xmath147 where the decay rate for the charge conjugate process @xmath148 is obtained from the rate for @xmath0 by reversing the sign of the weak phases @xmath115 and @xmath16 . since in the vqm ,",
    "the effective lagrangian ( 15 ) contains terms with different cp - odd weak phases , as well as , ld continuum and resonance contributions which are sources of perturbative and nonperturbative cp - even strong phases , the direct cp asymmetry ( 38 ) , unlike the sm , is expected to be non - zero .",
    "the size of this asymmetry , which is zero for invariant dilepton masses below @xmath149 threshold due to the vanishing strong phase , depends on the interplay of the various contributing terms .",
    "our results for certain choices of the model parameters are depicted in fig .",
    "5 . from fig . 5(a ) and 5(b ) , we observe that when the weak phase @xmath16 is large , smaller values of the non - unitarity parameter lead to significantly larger cp asymmetries sensitive to the @xmath10 quark mass , @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , for a negative relative sign of the tree level contribution ( @xmath150 ) and @xmath151 , as is shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) , asymmetries of the order of 10% can be achieved .",
    "on the other hand , for smaller values of @xmath16 , larger @xmath135 values can generate asymmetries of the order of a few percent if @xmath152(fig .",
    "finally , we find out that for a purely real deviation of @xmath117 from unitarity , i.e. @xmath153 or @xmath154 , the cp asymmetries away from the resonances are smaller .",
    "figure 5(d ) shows a particular instance of this situation where off - resonance - peak cp asymmetries are less than 2% , at most .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated various observables of the dileptonic rare b decay @xmath0 in the presence of an extra generation of vector - like quarks .",
    "the measurement of this decay channel in the near future should provide more stringent constraints on the model parameters .",
    "we showed that the shape of the differential branching ratio and forward - backward asymmetry distribution can be quite distinct from the sm predictions .",
    "cp asymmetry in this decay mode , which is near zero in the sm , shows significant sensitivity to the vqm parameters .",
    "asymmetries of up to 10% can be achieved for a typical choice of the parameters which is used in our investigation .",
