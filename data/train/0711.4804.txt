    "an understanding of flow and transport processes in geologically disordered media is necessary for the efficient extraction of fluids from underground hydrocarbon reservoirs .",
    "situations where flow proceeds through networks of connected fractures are particularly attractive , because the throughput is generally much higher than may be achieved through intergranular porosity alone @xcite .",
    "an important feature of subsurface fractures , which considerably complicates the problem , is that the surfaces of naturally fractures rocks are not smooth or even randomly rough , but rather are highly correlated self - affine fractals @xcite .",
    "a second complication in the analysis is that typical reservoir fluids are often complicated mixtures , which exhibit non - newtonian flow behaviors such as shear - thinning or shear - thickening . yet",
    "a third difficulty is that the subsurface fracture flow often involves much higher velocities than in the intergranular case , and the common simplification of low - reynolds number linear flow is inapplicable .    in this paper",
    "we use lattice boltzmann calculations to elucidate the combined effects of self - affinity , non - linear rheology and finite inertia in fluid flow through a single fracture .",
    "previous authors have considered subsets of these complications , but not all three simultaneously .",
    "the flow of newtonian fluids in self - affine fractures at both low @xcite and finite @xcite @xmath1 has an extensive literature . some controlled experiments on shear - thinning fluids in self - affine fractures at low @xmath1",
    "have been reported @xcite .",
    "lastly , experiments and phenomenological models for non - linear fluid motion in intergranular porous media at various @xmath1 are available @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that flow in a fracture can be characterized in a manner similar to the latter problem , since in both cases the key effect is that the random solid boundary of the flow domain causes streamlines to wind around .",
    "one simplification which we _ can _ exploit , however , is to focus on two - dimensional flows .",
    "it is well known that the flow of a single fluid in a straight channel differs only in detail between two and three - dimensional cases , and furthermore , in porous media flow in the analogous intergranular case , one sees the same flow laws for both two and three dimensional geometries .",
    "the approach taken in the paper follows the lines of our previous studies of permeability @xcite and transport @xcite in self - affine fractures based on the lattice - boltzmann method , along with a procedure for incorporating power - law viscosity variation similar to that developed previously @xcite .",
    "the discussion of inertial effects is influenced by previous studies for the case of a newtonian fluid in intergranular porous media @xcite .",
    "the fracture surface is generated numerically by a fourier transform algorithm and discretized on the regular lattice used in the flow problem .",
    "the upper and lower fracture surfaces bound the allowed nodes in the flow domain , a bounce - back condition enforces the no - slip boundary condition , and constant forcing provides a pressure driven flow . for power - law fluids , the lattice - boltzmann relaxation time is adjusted locally in space and time to provide the desired relation between stress and strain .",
    "the relation between imposed pressure drop and total fluid flux provides the permeability , and the local flow fields are analyzed to discuss the velocity , pressure and shear stress variations .",

    "we further assume that the surface has spatial isotropy in its mean plane .",
    "the surface is further characterized by the amplitude of the roughness , or equivalently the prefactor @xmath5 in the height - height correlation function , @xmath6 ^ 2\\rangle = c_0 ( |\\mathbf{\\delta}|/\\ell)^{2\\zeta } \\label{eq : cf}\\ ] ] where the intrinsic length scale @xmath7 might be the grain size in experiment or the lattice spacing in a calculation . in practice",
    "we generate self - affine surfaces using the a fourier synthesis method @xcite as in @xcite .",
    "a self - affine fracture channel is made of two complementary self - affine surfaces separated by a gap , and in some cases the surfaces are shifted relative to each other parallel to the mean plane .",
    "the statistical properties of the fracture are specified by the hurst exponent , the mean aperture between two surfaces , the shift distance , if any , and by the amplitude of the roughness .",
    "the height fluctuations of a single self - affine surface increase with its lateral extent @xmath8 , so that the difference between the maximum and minimum heights scales as @xmath9 , and we consider the limit @xmath10 , as shown for a typical fracture in fig .",
    "[ fig : saff - geom ] .",
    "[ fig : saff - geom ] ]    note that the effective flow diameter of the fracture varies along its length and can be much smaller than the mean aperture , due to the tortuosity of the channel .",
    "when a lateral shift is present , the aperture varies locally as well , and furthermore if @xmath11 is too small the sides of the fracture may overlap .",
    "since the flow domain is bounded by highly irregular surfaces , the lattice boltzmann method @xcite is particularly convenient for fluid mechanical calculations , since the excluded solid region may be simply specified by a mask .",

    "more details may be found in @xcite , and a recent review of flow simulations in this context is presented by verberg and ladd@xcite .",
    "the basic idea in extending the lattice boltzmann method to power - law fluids was presented by aharonov and rothman @xcite , and consists of adjusting the relaxation time @xmath21 _ locally _ so as to achieve the desired ratio of stress to strain rate .",
    "here we consider power - law fluids using a generalized newtonian model , as in @xcite , where the relation between the stress tensor @xmath25 and the strain rate tensor @xmath26 is similar to that for newtonian fluids , @xmath27 , but the local viscosity @xmath28 is a function of the invariants of the strain rate tensor .",

    "the procedure in @xcite was to obtain the strain rate tensor by numerical differentiation of the previously calculated velocity field , then determine the appropriate local viscosity and thence the local relaxation time .",
    "here we adopt a different procedure : in the lattice boltzmann method the strain rate tensor is directly related to the velocity distribution function by @xcite @xmath36 which should in turn equal @xmath37 , there is a constraint on the @xmath38 which is solved by iteration .    to validate the formulation of power - law fluids given above",

    "et al_. @xcite for the newtonian case .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath40 along the channel we compute the maximum over @xmath58 of @xmath59 , although we would have reached the same qualitative conclusions had we considered the maximum over @xmath58 of @xmath60 .",
    "calculations were performed for three values of the pressure gradient , @xmath49 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which correspond to reynolds numbers @xmath63 , 37.0 and 92.7 , respectively , for the newtonian fluid .",
    "since the viscosity varies within the channel for the shear thinning and thickening fluids , there is no unique definition of @xmath1 in those cases , although a convenient choice will be introduced in section  [ sec : perm ] for scaling purposes .",
    "the resulting plots of maximum velocity are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxv - n ] , where each velocity is normalized by the average streamwise flow velocity @xmath64 ( referred to as the interstitial velocity @xmath65 in @xcite ) , which equals the flux divided by the channel width .",
    "obvious peaks appear at the positions of the visible constrictions in the channel near @xmath66 , 110 and 240 , reflecting the narrowed aperture there .",
    "the normalized peak heights are fairly insensitive to the reynolds number , although away from the peaks the trend is for maximum velocity to increases with @xmath1 .",
    "note that for a flat channel , the the normalized maximum absolute velocity would equal 1.5 , so the values of 5 or more seen here are a substantial enhancement .",
    "the peaks are not _ all _ closely correlated with channel constrictions , however : near @xmath67 and 130 maximum velocity peaks occur , but at these locations the channel is expanding just downstram of a constriction .",
    "it is also possible to calculate a `` maximum velocity trajectory '' , following @xcite , as the set of @xmath68 gridpoints which at each @xmath40 has the @xmath58-value corresponding to the position where the maximum velocity occurs . for the most part our observations concerning the behavior of these trajectories",
    "is similar to that reported in this reference , but we do not observe the line - length of this trajectory decreasing monotonically with @xmath1 .    comparing the other fluids to the newtonian case , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : maxv - n ] that the global maximum absolute velocity always occurs at the narrowest constriction near @xmath69 and the other primary peaks always occur at the same positions , @xmath66 and 240 , as well .",
    "furthermore , each peak has roughly the same ( normalized ) velocity value . in the shear - thinning case , both the variation in @xmath40 away from the peaks / constrictions and the variation with pressure gradient are weaker than in the other cases , which may be attributed to the fact that typical velocities in the fracture are smaller in this case , and inertial effects play a weaker role . in the shear - thickening case , where typical velocites are larger , the maximum velocity values are larger off the peaks values , and furthermore exhibits rather more variation with @xmath40 and @xmath1 than the other fluids .",
    "the probablity distribution of velocity magnitudes is also of interest @xcite , since the presence of low and high velocity components strongly influences mixing processes and transport of passive tracers and suspended particles @xcite .",
    "histograms of the observed absolute value of the velocity for the three fluids at various pressure gradients are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : velfreq ] . in all cases there is a peak near the origin , which reflects the numerous low - velocity zones in the crevasses at the fractures walls , along with a higher - velocity peak resulting from the rapid flow in the channel constrictions .",
    "the latter moves out to higher values as the pressure gradient increases ( note the normalization by @xmath64 in the figure ) once again , the shear - thickening case behaves somewhat differently than the other two fluids , showing a less prominent and broader `` constriction peak , '' and more variation with @xmath50 .",
    "the distribution of pressure and stress in the fluid are important for non - newtonian rheology , and in considering possible erosive processes on the fracture walls . to contrast the behavior of the different fluids , fig .",
    "[ fig : p - diff - n ] shows the pressure `` fluctuations '' along the channel for the three power - law fluids @xmath70 , 1.0 and 1.25 .",
    "the fluctuation @xmath71 is the deviation in pressure from the imposed linear gradient , which would vanish identically in a hele shaw geometry . in the figure ,",
    "the fluctuation has been normalized by the imposed pressure difference , @xmath72 , and averaged over the channel width .",
    "for all three fluids , the pressure fluctuation are most significant in the vicinity of the main constrictions in the channel where the fluid accelerates , rising just before each constriction s location and dropping rapidly as it is traversed .",
    "some additional structure arises at positions @xmath40 of bends in the flow path , another source of fluid acceleration .",
    "again , the shear - thinning and newtonian fluids behave somewhat similarly , while the variation is strongest in the shear - thickening case .",
    "the variation in fluctuation with imposed gradient is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - n ] , and indicates the expected general increase in magnitude with @xmath50 along the channel .    to assess the effects of the flow on the fracture wall , we first calculate the average force exerted by the fluid on the wall , @xmath73 where the integral runs over the fracture surface ( a curve in this two - dimensional calculation ) , and @xmath74 is the local normal to the wall .",
    "the force is then decomposed into @xmath40 and @xmath58 components , representing the average drag and thrust on the wall , respectively , and then normalized by a typical inertial pressure @xmath75 times the nominal surface area @xmath76 , to give drag and thrust coefficients @xmath77 note that aside from the ( reasonable ) use of the inertial pressure , the remainder of the normalization is somewhat arbitrary but a fixed constant for each fracture , and mainly serves to provide dimensionless drag and thrust coefficients . the drag and thrust forces for the lower and upper walls of the channel are similar but not identical because of the asymmetry of the fluid - solid boundary , and for definiteness we present only the forces on the lower wall .",
    "the results of calculating the drag and thrust coefficients is shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : drag ] and [ fig : thrust ] for the three fluids with exponents @xmath78 . in all cases ,",
    "the coefficients exhibit simple power - law behavior , provided @xmath50 is not too large , and the transition to a different behavior at larger @xmath50 may be associated with the onset of inertial effects ( see the following section ) .",
    "this form of scaling behavior result is consistent with the experimental results reported in @xcite , and the values of the slopes found in the log - log plots in the low-@xmath50 range , -1.67 , -1.02 , -0.62 for @xmath70 , 1.0 and 1.25 , respectively , for _ both _ drag and thrust , may be understood from the following argument .",
    "if inertial effects are absent , one expects the scaling behavior in a rough channel to be the same as in a straight channel . in that case , from eq .",

    "the drag and thrust _ coefficients _ are then @xmath83 , giving exponents -5/3 , -1 and -3/5 , respectively , for the three fluids .",
    "next we consider global behavior  the permeability of a self - affine fracture channel .",

    "the average in question could be a volume average or an ensemble average , and for a flow which is macrosopically unidirectional , an operational definition of permeability is @xmath87 where @xmath44 is the flux through a sample of cross - sectional area @xmath88 and length @xmath8 . in a two - dimensional situation ,",
    "the area is replaced by the width @xmath89 , and @xmath44 is the flow per unit length in the third direction .",
    "a definition identical to the latter case may be used for the permeability of low reynolds number newtonian flow in a fracture .",
    "both finite reynolds number flow and non - newtonian fluid rheology modify this description .",
    "we first consider the effects of inertia , and then examine how permability relates to the fracture morphology .      at higher flow rates when inertial effects appear ,",

    "this picture is supported by experiments , analytic calculations , and numerical simulations @xcite .",

    "to test this idea , note that we are concerned here with the statistical behavior of self - affine fractures , rather than the details of flow in one particular geometry which was relevant in the previous section , so an ensemble average over six realizations of the fracture surface is used .",

    "the need for different plotting variables arises becuase in the non - newtonian cases , the flow rate fluctuates substantially at low @xmath50 and division by @xmath95 is numerically unstable . beyond the quasi - linear regime , the newtonian case shows the expected trasition to a forchheimer flow regime @xmath96 at larger forcing , and the shear - tickening fluid shows a somewhat analogous behavior @xmath97 .",

    "to understand the numerical coefficient in the flow results , the fracture - modified darcy permeability , we again refer to the hele shaw case and define @xmath98 since the roughness and tortuosity of the fracture cause the stramlines to bend and viscous dissipation to increase , the permeability should be reduced compared to a smooth and flat hele shaw geometry of the same aperture . in table",

    "for general purposes it is preferable to use a dimensionless quantity such as the reynolds number as the independent variable , but the definition of @xmath1 for power - law fluids is not entirely obvious for power - law fluids because the the viscosity varies over the flow domain .",
    "one way to combine the results for different fluids is based on an analogy to the friction factor scaling laws for flow in pipes originally due to nikaradze @xcite , which can be extended to non - newtonian fluids as shown by metzner @xcite .",
    "recall that for unidirectional flow of a newtonian fluid of viscosity @xmath28 in a pipe of diameter @xmath101 , the mean velocity is @xmath102 and the shear stress at the wall is @xmath103 , so if one defines the conventional friction factor as @xmath104 , then one finds @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",

    "increasing the length allows for more fluctuation in the channel width ( see eq .",

    "a possible interpretation is that in the shear - thickening case , for the same pressure gradient the average velocity is larger than that for the other fluids , so that fluid inertia comes into play .",

    "we again compute the flux depletion relative to a flat channel having the same initial aperture , using six realizations of a self - affine fracture wall with hurst exponent @xmath116 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : saff - shift ] the flux decreases somewhat faster than linearly with shift , by producing narrow gaps when proturbances on the two sides are brought closer to one another .",
    "the shear - thinning and newtonian fluids have a fairly similar behavior , while the reduction is twice as large in the shear - thickening case , perhaps again as a result of inertial effects . as in the previous discussion , using a different value @xmath118 for the hurst exponent gives the same trends .",
    "using a new implementation of the lattice boltzmann method for power - law fluids , we have investigated their flow in two - dimensional self - affine fracture channels as a function of applied pressure gradient .",
    "generally , fluids with different power - law index behave in a similar manner when their flow parameters are properly scaled , using standard results for flow in constant - thickness channels .",
    "many previous results for newtonian fluids in self - affince fractures are found to generalize in a straightforward manner .",
    "however , shear - thickening fluids , which have higher velocities for the same pressure gradient than newtonian or shear - thnning counterparts , are more susceptible to inertial effects .    with regard to the local flow fields ,",
    "we first considered the maximum absolute velocity as a function of distance along the mean flow direction , which was found to fluctuates along the fracture channel due to its tortuosity and the variable effective aperture along the channel . the local maxima of this maximum absolute velocity occur at points of narrowing or minimal effective aperture , and the range of maximum absolute velocity relative to the global mean velocity ranges from about 1.5 to 5.5 . with increasing inertia , this normalized maximum absolute velocity increases for all power - law fluids to different degrees , with shear - thickening fluids having the largest effect and shear - thinning the least .",
    "as the pressure gradient increases , the normalized maximum velocities near the constrictions are relatively constant but outside these points velocities tend to increase .",
    "the variation in velocity is greatest for a shear - thickening fluid and lest for shear - thinning .",
    "pressure fluctuations along the channel increase with forcing for all fluids , and for a given pressure gradient increase with the power - law index @xmath47 .",
    "the relationship between pressure gradient and flux is found to have the same functional form as for flow in a flat channel , @xmath135 , when inertial effects are absent . at higher @xmath136",
    ", newtonian fluids behave in the same way as in intergranular porous media , and shear - thinning fluids behave analogously , but the shear - thickening case does not show simple power - law behavior .",
    "it is possible to collapse all of the data on flux _",
    "vs_. pressure gradient into a universal friction factor curve .",
    "the variation of flux with system length was shown to scale with system length with an exponent algebraically related to the hurst exponent , in a manner which generalizes the newtonian case .",
    "the most interesting question raised by these results is the form of the flux - pressure gradient relationship in the regime of strong inertia in the non - newtonian case . in this work ,",
    "we were limited in the range of accessible pressure gradients by numerical instabiliites , and it is desirable to improve the algorithm so as to consider higher pressure gradients and further explore the dynamics of the inertial regime .",
    "an extension of these considerations to viscoelastic fluids is likewise highly desirable , but new ideas beyond the methods used here are needed .",
    "this work was supported by the nsf crest center for mesoscopic modeling and simulation at ccny , and the geosciences program of the office of basic energy sciences , u. s. department of energy .",
