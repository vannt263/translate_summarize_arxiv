    "there is a long literature on computing soliton solutions , of varying co - dimension , in both non - supersymmetric  @xcite and supersymmetric / superstring @xcite theories of physical interest .",
    "this was followed , in each of these contexts , by computations of the lowest order dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) actions on the worldvolumes of these solitons  @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been interest in extending these calculations to include higher - dimensional operators , involving both extrinsic and intrinsic curvature , in these effective actions .",
    "this has been carried out with differing techniques , using both probe and back - reacted geometries , for bosonic  @xcite and supersymmetric branes @xcite .",
    "apart from the inherent interest in computing these higher - order corrections to the effective actions , the advent of galileon theories has led to renewed interest in higher - derivative terms .",
    "first discovered in the context of the decoupling limit of the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) brane - world scenario  @xcite , where the galileon scalar is related to the brane bending mode , galileon theories have since been generalized  @xcite .",
    "galileons have two remarkable properties : first , despite the fact that their interactions are higher - derivative , the corresponding equations of motion are nevertheless second order , and second , these interactions possess extended non - linearly realized symmetries .",
    "the original galileons of @xcite possess another important property that justifies treating them separately from the other possible non - galileon higher - derivative terms which possess the same symmetries .",
    "there can be non - linear solutions and regions of momentum and field space for which galileon terms are important relative to the kinetic terms , and yet the non - galileon terms are unimportant , allowing us to work with only the finitely many non - linear galileon terms rather than the whole effective field theory expansion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , galileons can lead to stable ( that is , ghost - free ) violations of the null energy condition  @xcite , akin to the ghost condensate  @xcite .",
    "in fact , supersymmetric condensates naturally give rise to super - galileons  @xcite .",
    "this violation allows for non - singular bounces in the early universe  @xcite and cosmologies that expand from an asymptotically - flat past  @xcite .",
    "these interesting solutions generally require the galileon - like terms to be important relative to the kinetic terms , so from an effective field theory point of view , if other unknown higher - order terms are to be neglected , it is crucial that the galileons have the property described in the previous paragraph .",
    "there are extensions of the original galileons , the dbi galileon , that arise naturally in describing the brane - bending mode of co - dimension one and higher brane worldvolumes  @xcite .",
    "they arise from lovelock terms and their boundary terms in the worldvolume actions .",
    "the original galileons are obtained after a certain small field limit .",
    "non - lovelock terms on the worldvolume lead to non - galileon terms .",
    "since the dbi galileons arise from the point of view of a brane probing a relativistic spacetime , it is natural to ask whether there can be regions of momentum and/or field space in which the dbi galileons are important relative to the dbi kinetic term , yet still dominant over the non - galileon terms , as is the case for the original galileons .",
    "if this is the case , then in these regimes , only a finite number of higher - derivative terms in the worldvolume action would have to be computed to completely determine the interesting non - linear dynamics .",
    "the dbi galileons admit superluminal propagation around non - trivial solutions @xcite which , along with other arguments , suggests that any uv completion , though not necessarily inconsistent , will not be in the form of a local lorentz invariant quantum field theory or string theory @xcite .",
    "thus , if a low - energy worldvolume theory on a brane could be derived in which there were a sharp limit where only the galileons are important , it would mean that either the theory describing the brane does not have a uv description as a local lorentz invariant quantum field theory / string theory , or that the arguments concerning the connection between low - energy superluminality and uv physics are somehow evaded .",
    "motivated by these reasons , and simply by the desire to have a consistent and general method for calculating low - energy worldvolume actions for solitons in more general spacetimes , we present here a calculation of the leading and subleading corrections to the dbi worldvolume action of a scalar kink in anti - desitter ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers applying this extended method to effective string solitons of physical interest , which we hope to apply to uv complete systems like the heterotic string . in a series of papers  @xcite ,",
    "gregory and collaborators presented a particularly compelling approach to the problem of computing higher - order corrections to worldvolume actions , within the context of flat space co - dimension one `` kink '' solitons .",
    "this involves a consistent series expansion in a parameter @xmath0 , the ratio of the kink thickness to the typical worldvolume fluctuation length . using this formalism ,",
    "the explicit worldvolume action of a probe kink in a flat background bulk space was computed  @xcite . in this paper , we modify and extend this formalism , using it to compute to second order in @xmath0 ( and a second parameter @xmath1 ) the explicit worldvolume action of a kink soliton in ads .",
    "this is carried out in two different ways , first with respect to the original ads metric and second using a rescaled flat metric . both lead to mutually consistent expressions for the worldvolume action including higher - order extrinsic and intrinsic curvature terms .",
    "although three terms are indeed conformal dbi galileons , a fourth term involving the square of the extrinsic scalar curvature explicitly is not  nor are there any momenta for which this term is sub - dominant .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ flat ] , we briefly review the formalism presented in  @xcite for computing the worldvolume action of a kink soliton of a real scalar field in flat spacetime . as a prelude to the ads calculation , and to set our notation , we carry out the computation to second order in the expansion parameter @xmath0 . in section [ ads ] , anti - desitter spacetime is introduced , and the potential energy of the real scalar field is modified so that its equation of motion admits a kink soliton of the same functional form as in flat space .",
    "we then generalize the formalism of @xcite so as to allow a calculation of the effective action on this kink worldvolume .",
    "the radius of ads space introduces , in addition to @xmath0 , a second expansion parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures , the generalized solution to the scalar equation of motion and the kink soliton worldvolume action are explicitly computed to second order in both parameters .",
    "working in ads spacetime introduces a number of technical issues , such as the appropriate `` cut - off '' of certain integrals , which are treated in detail .",
    "the conformally flat metric @xmath2 of ads space leads to a non - vanishing constant extrinsic scalar curvature that greatly complicates the above analysis . in the second part of section  [ ads ] ,",
    "we explore , in detail , the implications of working in a rescaled flat metric @xmath3 with respect to which the lowest order extrinsic curvature vanishes .",
    "it is shown how this simplifies the computation of the worldvolume geometric quantities , while leaving the analysis of the solution of the scalar equation of motion and the kink worldvolume action essentially the same .",
    "all these quantities are explicitly calculated to second order in @xmath4 .",
    "using the direct relationship between the two metrics , we then compare the results of both approaches and show that they are identical , as they must be .    in section  [ worldvolume ] ,",
    "we analyze the worldvolume action computed in the previous section .",
    "going to a conventional gauge , each term in the action is expressed as an explicit function of a real scalar field @xmath5the brane - bending mode .",
    "the relationship of these results to conformal galileons  @xcite is discussed .",
    "in addition to the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 galileons ( the final galileon @xmath9 appears at one order higher than our calculation ) , we find that there is a non - galileon term proportional to the square of the extrinsic curvature scalar .",
    "importantly , it is shown that that there is no region of momentum space for which this non - galileon term is sub - dominant .",
    "we conclude that , although important contributions , galileons are not the only relevant interactions on a kink / brane worldvolume . finally , in appendix",
    "a we prove that up to order @xmath10 , and to all orders with no worldvolume gradient operators , the worldvolume action can always be re - expressed purely in terms of galileons by a specific field redefinition .",
    "the `` non - galileon '' physics does not disappear  it is now non - trivially encoded in this field transformation .",
    "the most general action for a real scalar field @xmath11 with minimal kinetic term coupled to gravity in @xmath12 spacetime is given by @xmath13 where indices @xmath14 , @xmath2 is the five - dimension metric with signature @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the dimension @xmath17 newton s constant , @xmath18 is a cosmological constant and @xmath19 is an arbitrary potential .",
    "the associated einstein equation is @xmath20 where @xmath21 assuming that neither the temporal / spatial gradient nor the potential of @xmath11 depend on the @xmath12 planck constant , in the limit that @xmath22 the @xmath11 dynamics decouples from gravity .",
    "equation then becomes @xmath23 and the dynamics of the @xmath11 field can be consistently discussed in this background spacetime  the so - called `` probe '' limit  using the lagrangian @xmath24 in  @xcite , gregory and carter used this probe limit to compute the induced worldvolume lagrangian of the domain wall associated with the `` kink '' solution of the @xmath11 equation of motion in _",
    "flat _ spacetime . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review their formalism .",
    "begin by setting @xmath25 in and taking the background spacetime to be be flat , denoting the metric by @xmath26 . in cartesian",

    "now specify that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a positive constant of dimension @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is a constant of dimension @xmath34 , both independent of the @xmath12 planck mass .",

    "the equation of motion then reduces to @xmath37 demanding that @xmath11 be positive for positive values of @xmath38 , this has the well - known `` kink '' solution @xmath39 of width @xmath40 since this solution is independent of the remaining coordinates , it describes a static domain wall located at @xmath41 .",
    "we would now like to generalize this to kink solutions that depend on the remaining coordinates as well as @xmath38 .",
    "this will be achieved as follows .",
    "let @xmath42 specify the typical fluctuation length of the new solution along the remaining coordinates and define @xmath43 we will seek solutions for which @xmath44 and , hence , can be obtained from by a perturbation expansion . as discussed in @xcite , this",

    "there is a fundamental reason for this ; namely , prior to computing the worldvolume action of the domain wall , one must leave unrestrained any degrees of freedom intrinsic to the wall itself .",

    "<S> a formalism is presented for computing the higher - order corrections to the worldvolume action of co - dimension one solitons . by modifying its potential , an explicit `` kink '' solution of a real scalar field in ads spacetime </S>",
    "<S> is found . the formalism is then applied to explicitly compute the kink worldvolume action to quadratic order in two expansion parameters  associated with the hypersurface fluctuation length and the radius of ads spacetime respectively . </S>",
    "<S> two alternative methods are given for doing this . </S>",
    "<S> the results are expressed in terms of the trace of the extrinsic curvature and the intrinsic scalar curvature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to conformal galileon interactions , we find a non - galileon term which is never sub - dominant . </S>",
    "<S> this method can be extended to any conformally flat bulk spacetime . </S>"
