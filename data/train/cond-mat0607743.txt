    "many quantum phases and phase transitions can be understood with a local order parameter .",
    "however , it has been noticed that there is a class of distinct quantum phases which can not be characterized by any local order parameter . the underlying ` order ' of these phases",
    "is dubbed as ` topological order ' @xcite .",
    "one of the signatures of topological order , which has proven to be particularly useful in numerical studies of quantum hall systems , is the dependence of the ground state degeneracy on the topology of the manifold on which the system is defined .",
    "such a groundstate degeneracy is called ` topological degeneracy ' to distinguish it from the case of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking with a local order parameter , where the groundstate degeneracy is determined by the pattern of the symmetry breaking and thus does not depend on the topology .",
    "in addition to its conceptual interest , there is a renewed interest in topological degeneracy due to its potential for the realization of qubits , as topologically degenerate groundstates are expected to be stable against external perturbations coupling to local observables @xcite .",
    "particle statistics is a fascinating aspect of quantum mechanics . in general dimensions ,",
    "the quantum state of identical particles should be either unchanged or receive the overall phase factor @xmath2 under an exchange of a pair of particles .",
    "these correspond to bose and fermi statistics , respectively .",
    "however , in 2 dimensions , there are more possibilities .",
    "namely , the quantum state can acquire a nontrivial phase factor @xmath3 , where the real parameter @xmath4 is called statistical angle , under the exchange .",
    "this phenomenon is called anyonic statistics ( for @xmath5 ) .",
    "such a statistics is indeed realized for quasiparticles / holes in fractional quantum hall liquids .",
    "anyonic statistics can be further generalized to the situation in which multi - quasiparticle states ( which can be viewed as ground states on the multi - punctured sphere ) are topologically degenerate .",
    "then one of these ground states can transform into another under the exchange of identical particles .",
    "such a transformation can be parameterized by a matrix .",
    "this phenomenon is called non - abelian statistics , as the matrices corresponding to different exchanges generally do not commute . again",
    ", the non - abelian statistics can be realized , at least theoretically , in several proposed fractional quantum hall states .",
    "the first and most discussed example is the pfaffian state constructed by moore and read @xcite .",
    "numerical exact diagonalization studies @xcite of small systems indicate that this state is realized at the observed @xmath6 fractional quantum hall plateau @xcite .",
    "several experiments have been proposed which could confirm this @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that a very similar state ( differing only in the abelian part of quasiparticle braiding statistics ) is realized in sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 @xcite and ultra - cold fermions with a @xmath9-wave feschbach resonance in atomic traps @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian statistics of quasiparticles in this state has formed the basis of proposals @xcite for topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the unitary transformations resulting from particle exchanges are virtually errorless since they depend only on the topological class of the particles trajectories@xcite .",
    "quantum number fractionalization is another intriguing concept in the quantum many - body problem : the charge carried by a quasiparticle , which is an elementary excitation of the strongly - correlated ground state , can be fractional with respect to that of the original constituent particle ( electron ) .",
    "while the notion of fractionalization might seem to be quite independent of the two others introduced above , recently , a direct and close connection among these three concepts was demonstrated @xcite .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "namely , in a gapped system , topological degeneracy follows from the assumption that the quasiparticle carries a fractional charge : when the charge of the quasiparticle is @xmath10 in the unit of the electron charge , the groundstate degeneracy @xmath11 on the two - dimensional surface with genus @xmath0 is shown to satisfy @xmath12 moreover , the ( minimal ) topological degeneracy in such a case is also affected by the quasiparticle statistics .",
    "for example , if the quasiparticles obey either fermi or bose statistics , eq .",
    "( [ eq : minng ] ) can be replaced by the stronger condition @xmath13    however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the case of non - abelian statistics is not studied in detail .",
    "the general lower bound  ( [ eq : minng ] ) was derived without relying on any assumption about the statistics , and thus is expected to hold for both the abelian and non - abelian cases .",
    "nevertheless , it would be worthwhile to study the topological degeneracy in systems with non - abelian statistics from this new perspective .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the topological groundstate degeneracy of the moore - read pfaffian state , which exhibits non - abelian statistics , by generalizing the arguments in ref .",
    "the topological degeneracy of the pfaffian state is rather nontrivial .",
    "the degeneracy on a two - dimensional surface of genus @xmath0 has been related by read and green @xcite to `` spin structures '' in differential geometry . in this paper , we will show an alternative , more `` physical '' derivation of the topological degeneracy ( which might be actually related to the original argument based on an index theorem ) .",
    "the groundstate degeneracy of weak - pairing @xmath1 superconductor in two dimensions is also discussed based on a similar construction . in the course of doing this",
    ", we also make several observations which would be also valid for other systems with non - abelian statistics . in particular , we show that the abelian part of the statistics of a quasiparticle can be restricted by its effective charge .",
    "here we give a brief review of ref .  @xcite to make the paper self - contained .",
    "let us assume that we have a two - dimensional system of interacting electrons of charge @xmath14 .",
    "we further assume that there is a finite gap above the groundstate(s ) , and that the elementary excitations are quasiparticles / holes with the charge @xmath15 , where @xmath9 and @xmath16 are coprimes .",
    "first , let us consider the two - dimensional torus .",
    "we introduce the adiabatic insertion @xmath17 of the unit flux quantum in the `` hole '' of the torus , so that a vector potential is induced in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "furthermore , we define the process @xmath19 , in which a quasiparticle - quasihole pair is created and then the quasiparticle is dragged along the @xmath18-direction to wrap around the system before it is pair - annihilated with the quasihole .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect for this fractionally charged quasiparticle implies @xmath20 ( to make this more precise , the adiabatic flux insertion @xmath17 must be accompanied by a large gauge transformation . for simplicity we do not make it explicit in this paper , although it is essential for the argument to work .",
    "the details can be found in ref .",
    "it is natural to expect that both of these processes map a groundstate to a groundstate , which we assume for now .",
    "the `` magnetic algebra '' ( [ eq : magx ] ) acting on the groundstate subspace immediately implies that there must be at least @xmath16 groundstates on the torus .",
    "the same construction can be done in the @xmath21-direction , resulting in the magnetic algebra @xmath22 it appears that the two copies of the algebra lead to a @xmath23-fold degeneracy on the torus . however",
    ", this is not always the case because the two algebras may not be actually independent , depending on the quasiparticle statistics . for the case of abelian statistics",
    ", we have @xmath24 where @xmath4 is the statistical angle . for either bose ( @xmath25 ) or fermi ( @xmath26 ) statistics ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath27 commute . in this case , the minimum degeneracy on the torus is indeed @xmath23-fold . on the other hand ,",
    "as we have noted above , for other statistics , the two magnetic algebras are not independent , so the degeneracy does not have to be @xmath23-fold .",
    "in fact , the laughlin state at the filling factor @xmath28 exhibits the fractionalization with charge @xmath29 but the groundstate degeneracy on the torus is only @xmath16-fold .",
    "this can be understood as follows . in the laughlin state ,",
    "a quasiparticle / hole can be identified with a vortex / antivortex , namely the flux tube with unit flux quantum piercing through the two - dimensional surface .",
    "thus , as pointed out by wen and niu  @xcite , the process @xmath19 actually introduces a unit flux quantum through the `` hole '' of the torus , just as @xmath30 does .",
    "therefore , as far as the action on the groundstate subspace is concerned , we can identify @xmath19 and @xmath30 , although they are not completely identical .",
    "similarly , @xmath27 can be identified with @xmath31 .",
    "thus the two copies of the magnetic algebra are actually reduced to one for the laughlin state .    , with the three pairs of intersecting elementary cycles",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 , each of which is associated to a `` hole '' .",
    "elementary cycles belong to different pairs do not intersect with each other . ]    the above consideration can be readily generalized to the general two - dimensional surface with genus @xmath0 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : riemann ] , for genus @xmath0 , there are @xmath0 pairs of intersecting elementary cycles @xmath34 . for each cycle @xmath35 or @xmath36",
    ", we can construct the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : magx ] ) . among them , @xmath0 magnetic algebras ( one taken from each pair ) are always independent of each other",
    ". for example we can take the magnetic algebras of all @xmath37 s , which are independent .",
    "thus the minimum degeneracy of @xmath38 follows .",
    "in particular , in the laughlin state the magnetic algebra for @xmath39 cycle reduces to that of the intersecting @xmath37 cycle , as in the case of @xmath21 and @xmath18 of the torus .",
    "thus the groundstate degeneracy derived from the present analysis is only @xmath38 , which is indeed the correct degeneracy for the laughlin state .    on the other hand , for either bose or fermi statistics , @xmath40 and @xmath41 commute .",
    "this leads to the minimum degeneracy @xmath42 .",
    "in this section , we summarize the minimal knowledge of the pfaffian state and its non - abelian statistics needed for the next section .    the pfaffian state proposed by moore and read  @xcite is characterized by the following wave function of particles in a magnetic field ( on an infinite plane ) @xmath43 where pf denotes the pfaffian , which is the square root of the determinant of an antisymmetric matrix @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the antisymmetrization symbol ) .",

    "the latter is the case of relevance to the quantum hall effect .",
    "we emphasize that this refers to the statistics of the fundamental particle and is not to be confused with the statistics of the quasiparticles that are elementary excitations . in this paper , we call the fundamental , constituent particle an ` electron ' , even though it is a boson for @xmath48 even .",
    "the landau level filling fraction for this state is : @xmath49 @xmath50 corresponds to ( fermionic ) electron state with @xmath51 .",
    "the pfaffian state has quasiparticles and quasiholes with fractional charge and non - abelian statistics .",
    "@xcite initially , the pfaffian state was discussed in relation to conformal field theory and a chern - simons effective field theory .",
    "later , the nature of the pfaffian state was elucidated with the bcs - type pairing picture .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we follow the latter approach which is more accessible to a wider audience .    in the pairing picture , the pfaffian state can be understood as a `` weak - pairing '' @xmath9-wave ( @xmath1 ) paired state  @xcite of ` composite fermions ' .",
    "the composite fermion is an electron with @xmath52 unit flux quanta attached .",
    "the attachment of the flux quanta transforms the statistics of the composite particle to fermionic from the ` bosonic ' electron if @xmath48 is even , and keeps the statistics fermionic if @xmath48 is odd . in either case , the composite particle is a fermion and thus is called as the composite fermion ( cf ) .",
    "@xcite the cf has the same charge @xmath14 as the electron does . as in the laughlin state , a quasiparticle / hole can be identified with a vortex / antivortex . however , as the cfs are now paired , the minimal flux tube that can be contained in a vortex is now a half flux quantum , not a unit flux quantum .",
    "the calculation of the quasiparticle charge can be done similarly to the case of the laughlin state , and we obtain @xmath53 where the factor @xmath54 comes from the fact that the vortex contains a half flux quantum .",

    "in fact , since the parity of the fermion number is conserved , the hilbert space can be split into even and odd fermion number sectors .",

    "for an even electron number , the groundstate degeneracy is @xmath76 on the two - dimensional surface with genus @xmath0 . for an odd electron number , it reads @xmath77 here , the factor @xmath78 is the number of spin structures , and @xmath79 comes from the u(1 ) charge sector .",

    "we now generalize the argument in ref .",
    "@xcite to the pfaffian state .",
    "our starting point is the identification of the quasiparticle / hole as a vortex / antivortex , as we reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pfaff ] .",
    "because the vortex carries only a half flux quantum , the process @xmath27 introduces just half a flux quantum into the `` hole '' of the torus . thus @xmath27",
    "can not be identified with @xmath17 in the pfaffian state , in contrast to the laughlin state .",
    "rather , we can postulate @xmath83 in the pfaffian state , as doing the operation @xmath27 twice introduces a unit flux quantum just as @xmath17 does .",

    "when one quasiparticle is taken around the other , the unitary transformation @xmath89 is applied to the state of two quasiparticle - quasihole pairs . by assumption ,",
    "the quasiparticle - quasihole pair used to define @xmath19 fuses to the vacuum ( since they were created out of the vacuum ) , i.e. @xmath90 , and similarly for the quasiparticle - quasihole pair used to define @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath91 . however , the operation @xmath92 is not proportional to the identity ( or even diagonal ) in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",

    "therefore , this equation is nt quite right .",
    "however , it is still a useful heuristic as we will discuss in the following .",
    "now let us discuss the commutation relation between @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "the fractional charge of the quasiparticle implies  @xcite that @xmath95 on the other hand , because of eq .",

    "( [ eq : tsigma ] ) implies @xmath98 the second equality follows because @xmath99 .",
    "now , remarkably , the commutation relation is abelian , namely the factor @xmath100 is just a phase factor .",
    "the commutation relation  ( [ eq : fxtxb ] ) is related to four consecutive exchanges of a pair of quasiparticles , as the commutation relation of @xmath19 and @xmath27 is related to two consecutive exchanges .",
    "in fact , ivanov noticed that four consecutive exchanges reduces to a abelian phase factor  @xcite .",
    "our analysis indicates that this is indeed required by consistency with the `` charge '' relation  ( [ eq : fxtxc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the consistency between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fxtxb ] ) and  ( [ eq : fxtxc ] ) actually determines the abelian part of the statistics , which is not easy to obtain from the approach taken in ref .",
    "consistency between ( [ eq : fxtxb ] ) and ( [ eq : fxtxc ] ) requires @xmath101 namely , @xmath102 where @xmath59 is an integer .",
    "this includes the correct value @xmath103 . to see that this is the correct value",
    ", we note that the abelian part of the statistics is the same in both the ` weak pairing ' and ` strong pairing ' limits ; only in the former limit is there a non - abelian part as well . in the ` strong pairing ' limit ,",
    "the @xmath104 quantum hall state is a @xmath105 $ ] state of charge @xmath106 pairs .",
    "the quasiparticles have charge @xmath107=e/[2(m+1)]$ ] and statistics @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "in order to study the groundstate degeneracy of the pfaffian state on a torus , we classify the groundstates according to the eigenvalues of simultaneously diagonalizable operators",
    ". a natural candidate would be the set @xmath17 , @xmath30 .",
    "actually , generally they do not commute with the hamiltonian , as the flux insertion accelerates the electrons by the induced electric field and thus changes the energy .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , by our assumption that they map a groundstate to a groundstate , @xmath109 operators applied on a groundstate does not change the energy ( up to an exponentially small finite - size correction ) .",

    "the commutation relation  ( [ eq : fxtxc ] ) and @xmath118 implies @xmath119 where we have disregarded the phase of the wavefunction , which is not important in what follows .",

    "we start from an `` initial '' groundstate @xmath122 and construct other groundstates by applying @xmath123 .",
    "then it seems that we can construct @xmath124 groundstates ( including the original one @xmath125 ) , as follows . @xmath126 these states",
    "should be orthogonal to each other because they can be distinguished by different eigenvalues of @xmath17 and @xmath114 .    in particular , for the @xmath113 bosonic pfaffian state at @xmath127 and the @xmath50 fermionic pfaffian state at @xmath51 , the above logic would give ground state degeneracies of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "however , according to read and green  @xcite , the correct groundstate degeneracy on the torus is @xmath130 and @xmath52 in the even and odd electron number sectors , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also argued that , on the torus , the odd electron number sector corresponds to the boundary condition @xmath131 ( periodic boundary conditions in both directions ) .",
    "the even electron number sector corresponds to the other three boundary conditions @xmath132,@xmath133 , and @xmath134 , which have an antiperiodic boundary condition along at least one direction .",
    "the @xmath124 groundstates we have obtained above are too many for either the even or odd electron number cases , although it is indeed the sum of the degeneracies in both sectors .",
    "the resolution to the problem of `` too many groundstates '' is actually deeply connected to the non - abelian nature of the pfaffian state .",
    "the preceding discussion is based on the assumption that application of @xmath123 to a groundstate gives a groundstate .",
    "namely , after the pair annihilation , the system should go back into the vacuum ( groundstate ) .",
    "this would be true in the case of abelian statistics , where there is a single fusion channel for a quasiparticle and quasihole .",
    "however , in the case of non - abelian statistics , there are multiple fusion channels ( in this case , two ) for a quasiparticle and quasihole .",
    "one of these fusion channels is the vacuum , but the other is nt , so the pair might leave behind an excitation rather than annihilate to the ground state .",
    "here we reexamine the state @xmath135 , with a careful consideration of this .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us first consider periodic boundary conditions along both directions , i.e. @xmath131 boundary conditions .",
    "a quasiparticle - hole ( vortex - antivortex ) pair is created on the initial vacuum @xmath136 .",
    "let us denote the majorana fermion boundstate carried by the quasihole and the quasiparticle by @xmath85 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "just after the pair creation , the internal state is given by @xmath137 which satisfies @xmath138 for the complex fermion @xmath139 .",
    "the pair is created out of the ground state , so there can not be an extra fermion . similarly , the internal state of the pair _ must be in the same state @xmath137 before the pair can be annihilated . _",
    "otherwise , there will be a fermion left over .",
    "we point out that before the pair is annihilated , the relative locations of the pair must be the same as they were immediately after the pair was created .",
    "this is because the quasiparticle / hole are identified with a vortex / antivortex , which induce a phase change for cf operators as they are taken around them .",
    "as the vortex / antivortex in the pfaffian state contains a half unit flux quantum , the cf operator changes its phase by @xmath140 around the vortex / antivortex .",
    "thus , a string of the `` branch cut '' should be attached to the vortex / antivortex ( quasiparticle / hole ) as emphasized by ivanov  @xcite .",

    "it is straightforward to generalize the above argument to a general riemann surface with genus @xmath0 .",

    "thus the number of degenerate groundstates is again exactly the same as that of the @xmath113 bosonic pfaffian state .    finally",
    ", we remark on the difference between the weak - pairing ( non - abelian ) and strong - pairing ( abelian ) phases of a @xmath1 superconductor .",
    "the main difference between these two cases ( from the statistics viewpoint ) is that the zero - energy majorana mode in a vortex core is absent in the strong - pairing phase @xcite . instead , there are two boundstates whose energies are split around 0 . hence the `` elementary '' excitations in this case are ( empty ) vortices and bogoliubov quasiparticles , just as it would be for a generic @xmath234-wave superconductor discussed earlier .",
