    "type  ia supernovae are thought to be nuclear  powered disruptions of accreting or merging white dwarfs .",
    "most if not all other supernovae ( sne ) are thought to involve expulsion of the envelopes of massive stars following the gravitational collapse of their highly evolved cores . of these ,",
    "type  ii sne have conspicuous features due to hydrogen in their optical spectra .",
    "type  ib sne lack conspicuous hydrogen features but have conspicuous he  i features during their photospheric phase . in the spectra of type  ic sne , neither hydrogen nor he  i features are conspicuous . for reviews of sn classification",
    "see filippenko ( 1997 ) and turatto ( 2002 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of a typical sn  ii evolves from a nearly featureless continuum when the temperature is high to one that contains mainly hydrogen features and then gradually develops features of lower excitation due to ca  ii , fe  ii , o  i , na  i , and ti  ii , plus ba  ii and sr  ii if the temperature gets sufficiently low .",
    "apart from the defining differences involving the hydrogen and he  i features , the spectra of sne  ib and sne  ic evolve in much the same way .    among the questions that those who make explosion models of sne  ib and sne  ic would like spectroscopists to answer include two very basic ones .",
    "do sne  ib eject any hydrogen ? and do sne  ic eject any helium  and perhaps even some hydrogen ? i will be able to provide only partial and tentative answers to these questions  but i should at least be able to explain why they are so hard to answer .",
    "first we must say something about the analysis of sn spectra .",
    "one nice thing is that the simple explosion velocity law  velocity proportional to radius  ordinarily is an excellent approximation .",
    "one big problem is that ejection velocities usually are high , so spectral features are blended and the amount of information that can be obtained by analyzing the spectra with a ruler is limited .",
    "consequently , much use is made of synthetic spectra .",
    "the use of synthetic spectra for sne has been reviewed by branch , baron , & jeffery ( 2002 ) .",
    "detailed and physically self  consistent nlte synthetic spectra can and have been carried out with very complex codes , notably the phoenix code , but so far nearly all such work has been for sne  ia and sne  ii . at the other extreme , of simplicity , the fast parameterized synow code is useful for establishing line identifications and placing constraints on the velocity intervals in which the line ",
    "contributing ions are detected .",
    "we refer to this process as `` direct analysis '' to distinguish it from detailed spectrum synthesis with more complicated codes .",
    "the synthetic spectra shown in this article have been generated with synow .",
    "synow assumes spherical symmetry , velocity proportional to radius , and a sharp photosphere that emits a blackbody continuum .",
    "line formation , treated in the sobolev approximation , occurs only by resonance scattering of photons from the photosphere .",
    "the effects of multiple scattering ( line blending ) on the line source functions and the emergent spectrum are treated exactly , within the context of the model and the sobolev approximation . in the synthetic spectra shown in this article , line optical depths",
    "are taken to decrease as @xmath0 .",
    "for each ion whose lines are introduced , the optical depth of a `` reference line '' at the photosphere is a fitting parameter , and the optical depths of the other lines of the ion are determined by assuming lte level populations at some excitation temperature @xmath1 , which for the synthetic spectra of this article is 7000  k. oscillator strengths are kurucz ( 1993 )",
    ". line formation ordinarily takes place immediately above the photosphere , i.e. , the lower boundary of the line  forming layer has the velocity at the photosphere , @xmath2 .",
    "but sometimes it is appropriate to `` detach '' the lines of an ion by allowing line formation only above some detachment velocity that exceeds @xmath2 .    an undetached resonance  scattering line has a p  cygni profile consisting of a rounded emission component that peaks at the rest wavelength , and an absorption component whose minimum is blueshifted by the amount that corresponds to @xmath2 ( or more if the line is strong ) . a detached resonance",
    " scattering line also has a p  cygni profile but the emission component has a flat top , and the absorption minimum is blueshifted by the amount that corresponds to the detachment velocity .",
    "the absorption component of a detached line is deeper than that of an undetached line that has the same maximum sobolev optical depth ( jeffery & branch 1990 ; branch et  al .",
    "before discussing sne  ib we must mention sne  iib  events in which hydrogen features are conspicuous at early times but later become weak or undetectable . the first well observed example was sn  1993j in m81 ( matheson et  al .",
    "2000 and numerous references therein ) .",
    "conspicuous hydrogen features were present at early times , but conspicuous he  i features began to appear around 25 days after explosion ; later the hydrogen features became weak .",
    "the minimum velocity of the hydrogen  containing layer was about 9000 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "most estimates of the mass of this layer have been in the range 0.1 to 0.6  m@xmath4 ; the hydrogen mass was lower because much of the mass of this layer probably was in the form of helium .",
    "in sn  1996cb , the second well observed sn  iib ( qiu et  al . 1999 ) , he  i features appeared earlier , before maximum light , but a deep h@xmath5 absorption persisted throughout the photospheric phase .",
    "the minimum velocity and mass of the hydrogen  containing layer were about 10,000 km  s@xmath3 and perhaps @xmath6  m@xmath4 ( deng , qiu , & hu , 2002 ) .",
    "until recently not much work had been done on searching for hydrogen in sne  ib . branch ( 1972 ) considered h@xmath5 , as well as the strongest optical line of ne  i , @xmath76402 , as possible identifications of a deep absorption in sn  1954a .",
    "wheeler et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) tentatively attributed a weak absorption in sne  1983n and 1984l to h@xmath5 , as did deng et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) in sn  1999dn .",
    "an opportunity to study this issue more systematically was presented by matheson et  al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter m01 ) who published spectra of a number of sne  ib ( and sne  ic ) that were observed at the lick observatory during the 1990s .",
    "recently the synow code has been used to study the spectra of 11 sne  ib selected on the basis of having deep optical he  i absorptions ( branch et  al .",
    "2002 , hereafter b02 ) . as had been emphasized by m01 , from whom much of the data of the b02 sample were taken , in most respects the spectra of these events",
    "were quite homogeneous .",
    "the velocity at the photosphere , as inferred from fe  ii features near 5000   , decreased smoothly from about 11,000 km  s@xmath3 at the time of maximum light to about 5000 km  s@xmath3 50 days later , with little scatter . in postmaximum",
    "spectra the he  i absorptions generally were detached , with the detachment velocity ending up at about 7000 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "two events in the b02 sample , sne  1999di and 2000h , differed from the others by containing deep , persistent absorptions near 6300    that resembled the deep h@xmath5 absorption in the type  iib sn  1996cb .",
    "it is safe to identify the 6300    absorptions in these two sne  ib as h@xmath5 , detached at 12,000 or 13,000 km  s@xmath3 , because there is no plausible alternative identification that would not entail unwanted features in the spectrum , and because weak absorptions consistent with h@xmath8 could be seen .",
    "sn  1954a , for which of course only photographic spectra are available , appears to have been similar .",
    "i will refer to these events as `` deep  h@xmath5 '' sne  ib .",
    "they are classified as type  ib because when they were first observed the presence of hydrogen features was not obvious , even though their h@xmath5 absorptions were deep .",
    "the explanation , illustrated in figure  24 of b02 , is that because the hydrogen lines were detached , the h@xmath5 emission components that we are accustomed to seeing in sne  ii were flat and therefore inconspicuous , and the deep h@xmath5 absorptions were produced with sufficiently small h@xmath5 optical depths that the other balmer lines were too weak to be conspicuous .",
    "( the sobolev optical depth of h@xmath8 is lower than that of h@xmath5 by a factor of 7 . )",
    "if these events had been observed earlier their hydrogen features might have been stronger , undetached , and conspicuous , as in the earliest spectra of sn  1996cb , in which case these events would have been classified as sne  iib .    among the eight other events of the b02 sample , four ( sne  1983n , 1984l , 1996n , and 1999dn ) were first observed earlier than 10 days after maximum light and they also had absorptions near 6300   , but less deep than in the deep  h@xmath5 events .",
    "i will refer to these as typical sne  ib . in figure  1 a spectrum of sn  1984l",
    "is compared with a synthetic spectrum .",
    "b02 attributed the 6300    absorption in typical sne  ib to h@xmath5 , detached at 18,000 km  s@xmath3 in the earliest available spectrum and at 12,000 or 13,000 km  s@xmath3 when it was last observed .",
    "the identification was tentative , however , because h@xmath8 could not be seen , and there are other possible line identifications for the 6300    absorption .",
    "the strongest optical line of c  ii , @xmath76580 , would need to be detached only 800 km  s@xmath3 more than h@xmath5 , but highly detached c  ii lines would be surprising in sne  ib .",
    "the strongest optical line of si  ii , @xmath76355 , would need to be blueshifted 9500 km  s@xmath3 less than h@xmath5 , which is a problem because it would require the si  ii feature to form in deeper layers than the fe  ii features .",
    "a more plausible alternative to h@xmath5 is ne  i @xmath76402 , which would need to be blueshifted 7400 km  s@xmath3 less than h@xmath5 ; this would put it right at the same velocity as the fe  ii lines .",
    "the ne  i lines would need to be nonthermally excited , as are the he  i lines of sne  ib .",
    "when fe  ii features become strong they also can produce a feature that could be mistaken for highly blueshifted h@xmath5 ( see below ) , but in these four sne  ib the fe  ii features were not strong enough around the time of maximum .",
    "the best choices for the 6300  absorption in typical sne  ib seem to be detached h@xmath5 or undetached ne  i @xmath76402 .",
    "only very recently has it become clear that some events have optical he  i absorptions that are definite but not as deep as in typical sne  ib .",
    "i will refer to these as `` shallow  helium '' sne  ib .",
    "one of these , sn  1991d ( benetti et  al .",
    "2002 ) , deviates from typical sne  ib in other respects too .",
    "it was exceptionally luminous for a sn  ib ; 10 days after maximum light the velocity at the photosphere inferred from the fe  ii features was only 5000 km  s@xmath3 as opposed to 8000 km  s@xmath3 for typical sne  ib ; and at the same epoch the he  i lines were not detached from the 5000 km  s@xmath3 photosphere whereas in typical sne  ib they are detached at about 10,000 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "sn  1991d contained a weak 6300    absorption that can be accounted for by h@xmath5 detached at 12,000 km  s@xmath3 , but in synow synthetic spectra not only did ne  i @xmath76402 provide a nice fit to this feature , other ne  i lines did more good than harm ( figure  3 of benetti et  al . ) .",
    "ne  i @xmath76402 appears to be a serious alternative to h@xmath5 in sn  1991d .",
    "hamuy et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) have presented spectra of another shallow ",
    "helium sn  ib , sn  1999ex . in this case",
    "the fe  ii velocity evolution does conform to that of typical sne  ib .",
    "the depth of the 6300  absorption of sn  1999ex was in between those of typical and deep ",
    "hamuy et  al .",
    "labelled the 6300  absorption as si  ii but this identification encounters the problem mentioned above . in figure  2 a spectrum of sn  1999ex is compared with a synthetic spectrum in which the 6300    absorption is produced by h@xmath5 , detached at 15,000 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "undetached ne  i @xmath76402 also can fit the 6300    absorption fairly well but because it needs to be rather strong the other ne  i lines cause problems .",
    "h@xmath5 appears to be the most likely identification in sn  1999ex .",
    "in the past , two lines of evidence have been offered for the presence of he  i features in sne  ic , but both are difficult to confirm .",
    "first , in sn  1994i , the best observed sn  ic ( other than hypernovae ) , filippenko et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) observed a strong absorption near 1  @xmath9 that was attributed to he  i @xmath710830 .",
    "however , when we ( millard et  al .",
    "1999 ) carried out a synow analysis of sn  1994i , we were unable to account for the bulk of the 1  @xmath9 absorption with @xmath710830 without also producing optical he  i features that were too strong .",
    "we concluded that the 1  @xmath9 absorption may have been produced at least in part by c  i @xmath710695 and/or blends of si  i lines .",
    "baron et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) carried out detailed spectrum calculations with the phoenix code and also had problems accounting for the 1  @xmath9 feature in terms of @xmath710830 alone .",
    "the observations of the type  ib sn  1999ex by hamuy et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) clarify this issue .",
    "hamuy et  al",
    ". obtained good infrared spectra of sn  1999ex , and as expected from the presence of definite optical he  i features , the infrared spectra contained p  cygni profiles due to he  i @xmath710830 and @xmath720581 .",
    "( in lte the sobolev optical depth of @xmath710830 exceeds that of he  i 5876 by a factor of 7 at 10,000  k and 4.5 at 15,000  k. ) however , even though sn  1999ex had definite optical he  i lines , its @xmath710830 feature was weaker than the 1  @xmath9 feature in sn  1994i , which had less distinct , if any , optical he  i features .",
    "it is interesting that in sn  1999ex , unlike in sn  1994i , a synow synthetic spectrum that fits the @xmath710830 feature also fits the optical he  i features reasonably well .",
    "this supports the suspicion that the 1  @xmath9 absorption in sn  1994i was not mainly due to he  i @xmath710830  and if it was nt mainly due to he  i then it does nt provide convincing evidence for the presence of helium at all .",
    "the second line of evidence for he  i features in sne  ic has been the identification of weak absorptions in optical spectra with high  velocity he  i lines , detached at about 17,000 km  s@xmath3 ( clocchiatti et  al .",
    "however , m01 reexamined the evidence and were unable to confirm these identifications .",
    "one problem was that the absorption attributed to detached he  i @xmath76678 usually is substantially more blueshifted than those attributed to @xmath75876 and @xmath77065 .",
    "m01 also mentioned that the typical type  ib sn  1999dn , whose deep he  i absorptions were at low velocity , contained a weak absorption like the one that clocchiatti et  al .",
    "attributed to high ",
    "velocity @xmath75876 in sne  ic .",
    "in fact , that feature often appears in spectra of core ",
    "collapse sne , including the type  ii sn  1987a ( jeffery & branch 1990 ) , when the temperature is low enough for lines of singly ionized iron ",
    "peak elements to be strong .",
    "it is produced by a group of sc  ii lines from @xmath75641 to @xmath75684 .",
    "being unpersuaded by the first two lines of evidence for he  i in sne  ic , we consider a third . after failing to confirm high  velocity he  i absorptions in sne  ic , m01 mentioned that in the type  ic sn  1990b , if he  i absorptions were present at all , they were at low velocity .",
    "clocchiatti et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) also considered the possibility of low ",
    "velocity he  i in sn  1990b . in figure  3 a spectrum of sn  1990b",
    "is compared with a synthetic spectrum that contains undetached he  i lines .",
    "note that because fe  ii features are quite strong , they account nicely for the 6300    absorption .",
    "he  i @xmath75876 accounts for an observed absorption , but of course that observed feature could be na  i instead .",
    "more important is that the observed absorption near 6800    is accounted for by undetached he  i @xmath77065 , and i m not aware of any good alternative for undetached @xmath77065 ; neither a line of similar wavelength nor a line of longer wavelength that could be detached and mistaken for undetached @xmath77065 .",
    "an obvious problem is that there is no counterpart in the observed spectrum for the synthetic absorption produced by @xmath76678 , but this is not necessarily fatal for he  i. first , m01 showed that in sne  ib @xmath76678 gradually weakens relative to @xmath75876 and @xmath77065 ; this is to be expected on the grounds of nlte calculations ( lucy 1991 ; swartz et  al .",
    "1993 ) because @xmath76678 is a singlet transition while @xmath75876 and @xmath77065 are triplets , and the singlet resonance transition to the ground state becomes less opaque as the ejecta density decreases through expansion .",
    "it follows that the use of lte excitation in synow can overestimate the strength of @xmath76678 relative to @xmath75876 and @xmath77065 .",
    "second , in sn  1990b the @xmath76678 absorption would be partially filled in by the h  ii ",
    "region h@xmath5 emission seen in the spectrum , and possibly also by h@xmath5 emission from sn  1990b itself ( see  6 ) .",
    "another reason to take low ",
    "velocity he  i in sne  ic seriously is that the early spectra of sn  1994i contained an absorption feature that we ( millard et  al .",
    "1999 ) attributed to na  i @xmath75892 . but at these early times the color temperature was high  @xmath1017,000  k in the spectrum obtained four days before maximum brightness",
    ". the presence of na  i absorption at such a high temperature is doubtful . in sn  1987a , for example , na  i began to appear only when the color temperature fell to about 6000  k ( jeffery & branch 1990 ) . in the early spectra of sn  1994i even the ca",
    "ii absorptions were not yet very strong .",
    "the observed feature may have been produced by undetached he  i @xmath75876 rather than na  i.    during the course of an ongoing comparative study of spectra of sne  ic , similar to that of b02 for sne  ib , it has become clear that absorptions that can be attributed to undetached he  i @xmath75876 and @xmath77065 are common in the early spectra of sne  ic , and sometimes a weak absorption consistent with @xmath76678 also is present .",
    "in the past , two lines of evidence for the presence of h@xmath5 in sne  ic also have been presented , but again confirmation is difficult .",
    "filippenko , porter , & sargent ( 1990 ) and jeffery et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) tentatively attributed a weak absorption near 6360    in sn  1987 m to h@xmath5 , but as emphasized by wheeler et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) the required blueshift of h@xmath5 was suspiciously low compared to those of other lines in the same spectrum . in any case , the absorption in question is unusual , perhaps even unique so far ; it is not the same as the broader feature that is commonly referred to as the 6300  absorption , which ordinarily appears at a wavelength roughly consistent with undetached ne  i @xmath76402 ( whether ne  i is the right identification or not ) .",
    "the 6360    absorption in sn  1987 m is farther to the red .    more intriguing",
    "is that filippenko ( 1988 , 1992 ) pointed out that sne  ic have a broad emission peak near the wavelength of h@xmath5",
    ". we must be careful about attributing this feature to h@xmath5 emission when the fe  ii features are strong  but it appeared even in the pre ",
    "maximum spectra of sn  1994i , when the fe  ii features were not yet strong .",
    "it is indeed tempting to attribute this feature to h@xmath5 .",
    "the h@xmath5 would need to be in net emission ( as it often is in sne  ii ) , and to produce the rounded emission peak the h@xmath5 would need to be undetached .",
    "so  _ do sne  ib eject hydrogen ? _ yes , the deep ",
    "h@xmath5 events certainly do ; they appear to be closely related to sne  iib .",
    "in fact , the differences between sne  iib and the deep ",
    "h@xmath5 sne  ib can be so small that the classification of some events probably depends on how early the first spectrum is obtained . [ in the nomenclature of clocchiatti & wheeler ( 1997 ) the deep ",
    "h@xmath5 events could be included among the `` transition supernovae '' , sne  iit . ]",
    "whether typical sne  ib eject hydrogen is much more difficult to decide . given the strong similarities between the deep  h@xmath5 and typical sne  ib ( b02 ) , the most natural assumption would seem to be that the 6300    absorption in typical sne  ib also is produced by h@xmath5 .",
    "this is supported by the probable presence of intermediate ",
    "strength 6300    absorption in the shallow ",
    "helium sn  1999ex . on the other hand ,",
    "nonthermally excited ne  i lines are not implausible , and because ne  i @xmath76402 would not need to be detached it would require one fewer free parameter ( the detachment velocity of h@xmath5 ) .",
    "the 6300    absorption tends to drift redward with time like the other features ; this may seem to favor undetached ne  i , but it is not decisive since the detached he  i lines in sne  ib also drift to the red .",
    "( b02 offer an explanation . )",
    "how are we to decide about the h@xmath5 identification ?",
    "the most direct confirmation would be to detect paschen  alpha ( p@xmath1118751 ) , but in lte its sobolev optical depth is lower than that of h@xmath5 by a factor of 34 at 5000  k and 3.4 at 10,000  k , so this may not work",
    ". a larger sample of high quality optical spectra of typical sne  ib will allow the following test to be applied : if the 6300    feature _ always _ is consistent with undetached ne  i , then it probably is ne  i , because it would be hard to believe that hydrogen always is detached by the same amount with respect to the velocity at the photosphere .",
    "the current data are inconclusive on this point .",
    "_ do sne  ic eject helium ? _",
    "as we have seen , the 1  @xmath9 feature in sn  1994i does not provide convincing evidence for he  i @xmath710830 , and the presence of weak optical absorptions with highly detached he  i lines is unlikely .",
    "however , it may be that the optical spectra contain undetached he",
    "how are we to decide ?",
    "since he  i @xmath710830 can be confused with lines of other ions , the most direct test might be to look for @xmath720581 , which in lte has about the same sobolev optical depth as @xmath710830 above 10,000  k. ( but be careful  @xmath720581 is a singlet transition . ) infrared spectra also could be used to sort out the contributions of c  i and si  i to the 1  @xmath9 feature because both ions have other strong lines that should be detectable ( figure  12 of millard et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "_ do sne  ic eject hydrogen ? _ identifying the weak 6360  absorption in sn  1987 m with h@xmath5 may be questionable , but the possibility of emission near the rest wavelength of h@xmath5 looks interesting . the hydrogen would need to be undetached .",
    "this , together with the possibility that sne  ic contain undetached he  i lines , means that if sne  ic do eject helium and hydrogen then these elements extend to _ lower _ ejection velocities than in sne  ib .",
    "the appearance of the hydrogen and he  i features in sne  ib and sne  ic may be affected by the radial distributions of the helium and hydrogen in addition to the total ejected masses of helium and hydrogen .",
