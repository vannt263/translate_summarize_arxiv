    "the neutral scalar higgs boson @xmath1 is an important ingredient of the standard model ( sm ) and is the only sm elementary particle which has not been detected so far .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath2 of approximately 70 gev was obtained from direct searches at lep @xcite .",
    "the one sided @xmath3 confidence level upper limit on @xmath2 is @xmath4 gev @xcite .",
    "the perturbative unitarity suggests an upper limit on the higgs boson mass to be about @xmath5 tev @xcite .",
    "the properties of the higgs particle were studied in details by many authors ( see , for example reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the decay of the higgs boson into two photons will play an important and unique role .",
    "it is of interest for the following reasons :    * for the light higgs masses this decay mode provides a clear signature for the search at hadron colliders * the @xmath6 width determines the cross section for the higgs production in @xmath6 collisions @xcite * it is well known that the @xmath0 vertex can serve as a counter of the particles with masses larger than the higgs boson mass .",
    "it is widely accepted that a detailed experimental investigation will be performed at the next linear @xmath7 collider which will also operate in the photon - photon mode @xcite , as a photon linear collider ( see the review of physical applications in @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of studying scalar higgs boson in the s - channel production , for example in a reaction @xmath8 is not so obvious , because of large background from direct quark - antiquark production .",
    "fortunately , it was demonstrated that using the polarizations of initial photons one can suppress background process at high energy despite the qcd corrections to the background process is large @xcite .",
    "if the task of efficient suppression will be achieved , one can hope that the higgs will be investigated in detail in @xmath6 collisions and the idea of precise determination of the @xmath9 vertex will then become an important phenomenological issue .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9 vertex should be investigated as thoroughly as possible in the sm as well in the supersymmetric extension of the sm ( ssm ) .    in the present paper",
    "we study qcd corrections to the decay rate in the limit of the small ratio of the quark and higgs masses , @xmath10 and @xmath2 . in this limit",
    ", an interesting type of qcd double logarithms ( dl ) appears and we make an attempt of their resummation .",
    "the fact of the emergency of dl in the process @xmath11 was pointed in @xcite .",
    "the similar phenomena was found and studied in @xcite in the another physical process , @xmath12 in the @xmath13 channel .",
    "the authors of @xcite have performed a careful analysis of the origin of the dl appearance and studied dl terms up to two - loop accuracy .",
    "there are two reasons why the problem of dl in @xmath14 seems to be worth of being investigated .",
    "the first reason is more or less academical .",
    "once we have found a process where a new type of dl ( in a sense that it is not a sudakov - like logarithms ) appear it is interesting to understand their origin and even resum them . from qed and qcd",
    "we know a few examples where dl appear and can be resummed in observable quantities ( see , for example , reviews @xcite , and also recent paper @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we claim now that the @xmath11 decay considered here is the next new example .",
    "the second reason of interest is phenomenological . as we mentioned above the precise measurement of the @xmath11 decay width",
    "will be performed at next linear collider .",
    "we note at the very beginning that in the sm the contribution of light quark to the amplitude is proportional to the mass of this quark and therefore is small .",
    "however with an improvement of precision , the contribution of heaviest from light quarks , the b - quark , can become visible in future precise measurements at nlc .",
    "in addition we want to stress that in the ssm the coupling of the @xmath15 quark with the higgs may be large due to an additional large factor @xmath16 and that the contribution of the @xmath15 quark at large @xmath16 may be as important as the contribution of top quark or @xmath17 boson .",
    "in present paper we start with the one - loop analysis and demonstrate that one - loop and two - loop contributions contain a new sort of double logarithms @xmath18 if the ratio @xmath19 is quite small the parameter @xmath20 can be large enough and the qcd expansion in @xmath21 is not valid anymore .",
    "for example , considering a situation when the higgs has a mass @xmath22 and decays into two photons through @xmath15-quark loop and @xmath23 quark has a mass @xmath24 , we see that indeed @xmath25 and resummation of double logarithms is necessary . in the present paper",
    "we show that this goal becomes feasible when the physical origin of dl is understood and qcd series are properly organized .",
    "first , we examine an origin of such log s by using sudakov technique and then perform a two - loop calculation in dl approximation .",
    "the resummation of dl terms can be done and we present an exact answer in dla .    the paper is organized as follows . in the section 2",
    "we discuss the one - loop amplitude and the two - loop qcd correction .",
    "section 3 contains the resummation of the dl contributions in all orders the perturbative qcd and a brief discussion .",
    "we start with considering the amplitude of the process @xmath26 at leading one - loop level .",
    "the amplitude of the higgs decay into two photons through quark loop can be presented in the following form @xmath27 where the tensor @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are polarization vectors and momenta of the photons , @xmath32 - number of colors , @xmath33 - the electric charge of the quark @xmath34 and the variable @xmath35 is defined by the following relation : @xmath36    the corresponding decay width was calculated in @xcite at the one - loop level . in our notations , the quark formfactor @xmath37 defined by eqs .",
    "( 2 , 3 ) reads @xmath38 ^ 2 - 4 \\right),\\ \\ \\",
    "z_q =   \\frac{m_h^2}{4m_q^2 } = \\frac{1}{4x_q } > 1.\\ ] ] now we demonstrate how to extract the double logarithmic contribution from the amplitude using the sudakov technique . to understand a basic properties of the amplitude in dla we consider first a scalar part of amplitude without numerator and then discuss the structure of the numerator separately .",
    "the scalar part of the amplitude reads @xmath39 \\left [ ( k_2 - q)^2 - m_q^2 + i0 \\right ] \\left [ q^2 - m_q^2 + i0 \\right]}.\\ ] ] this integral is very simple and can be calculated explicitly .",
    "however , we are interested in terms containing double logarithms . the most suitable and simplest method of calculation was suggested by sudakov in @xcite .",
    "it consists in a direct integration in the momentum space splitting the internal momenta into the parallel and perpendicular components to the plane of the external momenta @xmath40 and @xmath41 . to this end ,",
    "one introduces new variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 using sudakov - decomposition for the vector @xmath34 @xmath44 we obtain for @xmath45 ( see also consideration of the similar integral in dla in ref . [ 15 ] ) @xmath46 @xmath47 \\left [ \\alpha + ( x_q + \\rho - \\alpha\\beta ) - i0 \\right]\\left [ ( x_q + \\rho - \\alpha\\beta ) - i0 \\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) we have performed an integration over the angles in the transverse subspace , using the fact that the integrand does not contain a dependence on these variables .",
    "it is then evident from ( [ 8 ] ) , that the double logarithmic contribution at @xmath49 comes from the integration region where @xmath50 to carry out the integration over @xmath51 we may apply the relation @xmath52 } = p\\frac{1}{x_q + \\rho - \\alpha\\beta } + i\\pi\\delta(x_q + \\rho - \\alpha\\beta).\\ ] ] in the above expression , @xmath53 means the principal value .",
    "one can check that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) does not contribute to the dl asymptotics of the formfactor and we do not consider it here .",
    "we get for the @xmath45 in dla @xmath54 in the last relation , we replace the strong inequality ( [ 10 ] ) by usual inequality , limiting the integration region in accordance with the logarithmic character of integration .",
    "let us now consider the numerator of the amplitude .",
    "it is clear from presented derivation that only the soft momenta @xmath34 give contribution to dl .",
    "that means that we may neglect the dependence on @xmath34 in the numerator of the integrand : @xmath55   = 4x_q.\\ ] ] we see that the numerator is proportional to the second power of the small quark mass .",
    "one power of the mass appears because of the yukawa coupling constant and the second power is due to the trace .",
    "it is important here that only the scalar term of the numerator of the @xmath56-channel quark propagator @xmath57 contributes to the amplitude . that has a simple physical explanation . the higgs particle has spin zero and positive parity .",
    "therefore , the initial and final total momenta of the subprocess @xmath58 are zero . and , the amplitude is suppressed by the mass of the light quark @xmath59 at high energy due to the nonconservation of quark helicity .",
    "we see that the quantum numbers of the external particles force to have a situation when the @xmath60channel quark propagator behaves like a scalar boson propagator , which is singular enough to produce dl . really , the scalar part of the quark propagator is more singular then the vector part in the limit of the soft momenta and this fact guarantees the appearance of the new non - sudakov dl .",
    "the possibility of the emergency of such dl in the mass suppressed amplitudes due to soft quark have been pointed and explained in @xcite , where helicity nonconserving amplitude @xmath61 was studied in dla .    despite the same origin the observed double logarithms in the @xmath11 process",
    "demonstrate some new peculiarities .",
    "for example , this phenomena 1 ) occurs not in the differential distribution or in the special helicity amplitude but rather in the decay width , 2 ) it occurs in the quark loop , but not as a correction to the born amplitude .",
    "therefore , the discussed phenomena is new in a sense that it appears in a very specific and unique circumstances , and of course , represents a new manifestation of the non - sudakov type of dl .    the integration in eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) is trivial .",
    "taking into account expression ( [ 14 ] ) for the numerator we get the formfactor @xmath62 in the dla : @xmath63    now we consider a qcd correction to the formfactor @xmath37 defined by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this qcd correction was calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the limit of small quark",
    "masses the correction has a simple form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is given by relation @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the color su(n ) group generators in the fundamental representation ( @xmath68 for qcd ) .",
    "there are four different topologies of the two - loop diagrams , which are shown in fig . 1 ( b - e ) . here",
    "we calculate them in the dl approximation by using sudakov technique .",
    "let us start from diagram 1b and consider first a scalar integral . here and below we always use the feynman gauge for the gluon fields ;",
    "the gluon propagator in this gauge is @xmath69 the scalar part of the @xmath70 reads @xmath71 \\left [ ( k_1 + q)^2 - m_q^2 + i0 \\right]}\\times\\ ] ] @xmath72 \\left [ ( k_2 - q)^2 - m_q^2 + i0 \\right ] \\left [ q^2 - m_q^2 + i0 \\right]\\left [ ( q - q)^2 - m_q^2 + i0 \\right]}.\\ ] ] in the sudakov variables @xmath73 we have @xmath74 \\left [ \\alpha + ( x_q + { \\vec q}^2 - \\alpha \\beta ) - i0 \\right]}\\times\\ ] ] @xmath75 } \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\frac{dadbd^2q}{\\pi^2}\\frac{1}{\\left [ b - ( x_q + { \\vec q}^2 - ab ) + i0 \\right]}\\times\\ ] ] @xmath76\\left [ \\left ( ( { \\vec q } - { \\vec q})^2 - ( a - \\alpha ) ( b - \\beta ) \\right ) -",

    "note that the external integral in eq .",
    "( [ 18a ] ) coincides with the one loop one .",
    "it is then evident that in order to get the dl contribution one should integrate over the following region @xmath79 @xmath80 making corresponding simplifications in eq .",
    "( [ 18a ] ) , performing integration over @xmath77 and @xmath78 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and taking into account only the absorptive parts of the corresponding propagators , we get @xmath81 because the essential momenta @xmath34 and @xmath82 are soft in dl approximation we can again neglect the dependence on them in the numerator in dl approximation .",
    "the numerator of the integrand then takes the form @xmath83 @xmath84 = - 4x_q\\frac{\\alpha_sc_f}{4\\pi}.\\ ] ] combining eqs .",
    "( [ 18c ] , [ 18d ] ) we obtain @xmath85    remaining two - loop diagrams of fig .",
    "1(b - e ) do not contribute to the dl asymptotics of the amplitude because both the electromagnetic vertex convoluted with a polarization vector of real external photon and the quark propagator do not contain double logarithms .",
    "these properties can be easily checked at the one loop level .",
    "only one large logarithm may appear in these structures in the feynman gauge but not the double one .",
    "thus , we have restored the exact result ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "it is clear from ( [ 16 ] ) that when the mass of the higgs boson is large enough so that in spite of smallness of the qcd coupling constant @xmath86 @xmath87 the perturbative qcd expansion in @xmath86 is not valid and we should modify two - loop result .    in the next section",
    "we obtain the quark formfactors @xmath37 in all orders of qcd in the following region of higgs boson masses @xmath88 in this region we expect to get the correct result in the framework of the dla .",
    "the resummed form factor can be presented in the form ( see fig .",
    "2 ) @xmath89 @xmath90,\\ ] ] where the amplitude @xmath91 is defined in such a way that it contains no two - quark cuts in the @xmath6- channel , @xmath92 is the exact qcd vertex which contains all possible gluon exchanges , @xmath93 is the exact quark propagator .",
    "double logarithms appear when we have consistent logarithmic integrations .",
    "therefore , only region ( [ 10 ] ) can yield the dl contribution to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) after integration over @xmath34 .",
    "as it is clear from the above discussion we should not consider qcd corrections to the amplitude @xmath94 and to the quark propagators @xmath93 in the dla , taking them in the born approximation .",
    "one has to know only the expression for the @xmath95 vertex @xmath96 in dla in the following kinematical region @xmath97 @xmath98 let us remind that in general @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "one power of @xmath10 appears from the @xmath100- vertex , the another one - from the trace over dirac indexes .",
    "the physical reasons for that were explained in the previous section .",
    "there was also noted that one of the two powers of @xmath10 appears from the quark propagator @xmath57 from the @xmath101 amplitude .",
    "due to this circumstance we are not forced to consider the @xmath102 corrections to the @xmath100- vertex .",
    "therefore , the exact result for this vertex in dla is given by multiplication of the born expression with the well - known sudakov form factor @xmath103.\\ ] ] therefore , the quark form factor @xmath37 in the dla can be found from eqs .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) by multiplying the integrand in the rhs of this equation with the sudakov form factor ( [ 28 ] ) and the result reads @xmath104.\\ ] ] the integration over @xmath43 can be easily performed and we have @xmath105 where @xmath106 . we have found that following representation is convenient @xmath107 @xmath108.\\ ] ] the eqs .",
    "( [ 29],[30 ] ) are our final results .",
    "they correctly describe the quark form factor @xmath37 in the region of the higgs boson masses where the relations ( [ 19 ] ) are fulfilled .    in fig.3 we plot relative contributions of two - loop ( dashed curve ) , three - loop ( dashed - dotted curve ) , four - loop ( dotted curve ) order results ( [ 30 ] ) end exact result in dla ( [ 29a ] ) ( solid curve ) as a function of @xmath109 .",
    "all results are normalized on the one - loop result .",
    "we see that at small enough @xmath35 , large z , the perturbation theory does not work and the resummation of dl is mandatory .",
    "the middle curve in fig .",
    "3 corresponds to the exact in dla result .",
    "we see that the later slightly decreases the decay width with increasing @xmath109 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have discussed a qcd perturbative corrections to the @xmath11 process in the limit of small quark masses in the loops .",
    "we have found a new manifestation of the non - sudakov type of double logarithms and have performed one- and two - loop calculation to find the origin of such double logarithms .",
    "then we have resummed them and have derived the exact result for the quark - loop form factor @xmath37 with double logarithmic accuracy ( [ 29],[30 ] ) .",
    "these results will be important in the situation when the higss boson is heavy enough to guarantee smallness of @xmath19 and when the mass @xmath110 itself is not very small to give visible contribution to the amplitude .",
    "such a situation can be realized 1 ) in the standard model with @xmath111 for the @xmath15 quark loop and 2 ) in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model , where the coupling of @xmath15 quark with higgs can be large .",
    "for the first application we need to measure the decay width of the @xmath11 process with very high precision .",
    "the feasibility of that depends on experimental side , of course , and should be studied separately .",
    "we should understand , of course , that at very high higgs masses two - loop electroweak corrections became very important due to terms proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "fortunately , they have been calculated @xcite .",
    "the second application seems to be very promising and important phenomenologically .",
    "the crucial fact here will be the value of higgs mass and the value of @xmath113 .      in our opinion , the results presented here may have applications to other cases .",
    "one of the most interesting is @xmath114 in the @xmath13 channel , where such non - sudakov , mass - suppressed dl terms are phenomenologically important , as it was demonstrated in ref .",
