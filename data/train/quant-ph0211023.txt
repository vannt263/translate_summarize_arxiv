    "the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite give the maximal violation of correlation function bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "the second best known multiqubit states is the @xmath1 family @xcite .",
    "their behavior is opposite in some respects to the ghz family .",
    "for example in the three qubit case , the @xmath1 state has the maximal bipartite entanglement among all three qubit states @xcite , whereas the ghz state , has no bipartite entanglement ( cf @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we exhibit a kind of complementarity between the @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 states and ghz states from the perspective of robustness of the nonclassical correlations against white noise admixture @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 state @xmath4 diluted by white noise , if measurements in a bell type experiment at @xmath3 parties are made in the computational basis and all yield the @xmath5 result ( associated with @xmath6 ) , the remaining pair of observers is left with a mixture of a @xmath7-qubit bell state with a substantially reduced amount of white noise .",
    "the probability of such a chain of events for the @xmath3 observers is quite low .",
    "nevertheless , we shall show that such an event contradicts , very strongly any local realistic description . in the case of the @xmath0-qubit ghz state diluted by white noise ,",
    "scenario of this kind can lead with unit probability to a 2-qubit bell state without reduction of noise . because of that , the n - qubit states of the @xmath1 class , for @xmath2 , can lead to more robust , against noise admixture , violations of local realism , than the @xmath0-qubit states of the ghz class .",
    "we also show that if an @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 state and a ghz state are separately sent through similar depolarizing channels , and the 2-qubit state conditioned on measurements at the @xmath3 parties is considered , the rate of obtaining singlets ( in specific distillation protocols ) can be higher in the case of @xmath1 state for a certain range of noise in the depolarizing channel .",
    "importantly , in such scenarios , the @xmath1 state performs better for _ higher _ levels of noise , and this feature grows with @xmath0 .",
    "these results may be of importance in quantum cryptography and communication complexity @xcite .",
    "we also show that these considerations lead to a relatively efficient entanglement witness .",
    "to analyze how strongly the @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 states violate local realism , we use the recently found multi - qubit correlation function bell inequalities which form a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a local realistic model for the correlation function in experiments with _ two _ local settings for each of the @xmath0 observers @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-qubit state @xmath8 can always be written down as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the identity operator and the @xmath11 s ( @xmath12 ) are the pauli operators of the @xmath13-th qubit .",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 are elements of the @xmath0-qubit correlation tensor @xmath15 and they fully define the @xmath0-qubit correlation function @xcite .",
    "a sufficient condition for the @xmath0-qubit correlation function to satisfy all correlation function bell inequalities is that for _ any _ set of local coordinate systems , one must have @xcite @xmath16 the sum being taken over _ any _ set of orthogonal pairs of axes of the local coordinate systems of all observers .",
    "consider a mixture @xmath17 , of @xmath18 with white noise @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the unit operator in the tensor product of hilbert spaces of the qubits : @xmath21 the parameter @xmath22 will be called here  visibility \" .",
    "it defines to what extent the quantum processes associated with @xmath23 are  visible \" in those given by @xmath24 .",
    "if the @xmath0-qubit correlations of a pure state @xmath25 are represented by a correlation tensor @xmath15 , then the correlation tensor of a mixed state @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "consider now the mixture of the 3-qubit state @xmath28 ( of visibility @xmath29 ) with white noise .",
    "the correlation tensor of the pure state @xmath28 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 forms a cartesian coordinate system with @xmath32 defining the computational basis .",
    "let us find the maximal value of the left hand side ( lhs ) of ( [ suff ] ) for @xmath33 .",
    "we will show that in an arbitrary set of local coordinate systems , @xmath34 the value of the lhs of ( [ suff ] ) , for the case when we are in the coordinate system in which ( [ corrw3 ] ) is written down , is zero . moving into a different coordinate system",
    "can be always done for each observer using three euler rotations @xcite .",
    "therefore we shall assume that first all three observers perform a rotation about the axes @xmath35 , then around the new @xmath36 directions and finally around @xmath37 directions .",
    "the set of first euler rotations leaves the value of the lhs of ( [ suff ] ) at zero .",
    "the second rotation around @xmath38 axes leads to following values of the components of the correlation tensor in the @xmath39 sector : @xmath40 is vanishing , whereas @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is not explicitly needed ) where the @xmath43 s are the local angles of the first rotations and @xmath44 s are those for the second one and @xmath45 . employing @xmath46 and that @xmath47 , one gets @xmath48 the right hand side of this inequality is a linear function in @xmath49 s and @xmath50 s .",
    "thus its maximal value is for extreme values of these parameters , and @xmath51 the last set of euler rotations around the @xmath37 axes can not change the value of the lhs of this relation .",
    "so , for any set of local coordinate systems , one has @xmath52 this inequality is saturated , as in the system of coordinates in which ( [ corrw3 ] ) is written down , @xmath53 ( note that @xmath54 is replaced by @xmath55 , in the last equation . )    for the noisy 3-qubit @xmath1 state , one has @xmath56 and thus there is no violation of the correlation function bell inequalities @xcite for @xmath57 note that at least one of the correlation function bell inequalities is violated ( as checked numerically ) for @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , if one takes a second look at the data , that can be acquired in a three qubit correlation experiment , with the noisy @xmath33 state , one can lower the bound for @xmath29 which allows for a local realistic description ( cf .",
    "suppose that in the bell experiment , the observer @xmath59 chooses as her / his measurements as follows : the first observable is the @xmath60 operator , and the second one something else . the computational basis for the third qubit is the eigenbasis of @xmath60 .",
    "the measurements of @xmath61 will cause collapses of the full state @xmath62 ( cf .",
    "( [ noisywn ] ) ) into new states .",
    "whenever the result is @xmath5 , the emerging state is of the following form : @xmath63 , where the werner state @xmath64 reads @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the new visibility parameter is given by @xmath67 the 2-qubit state @xmath64 has no local realistic description for @xmath68 therefore for this range of @xmath69 , the results received by the observers @xmath70 and @xmath7 , which are conditioned on observer @xmath59 getting the @xmath71 result ( when s / he measures @xmath72 ) , can not have a local realistic model .",
    "we have a subset of the data in the full experiment with no local realistic interpretation . surprisingly , the critical value of @xmath29 above which this phenomenon occurs is lower than @xmath73 : @xmath74 and can be obtained by putting @xmath75 in ( [ recur23 ] ) .",
    "the correlation functions are averages of products of the local results , and as such do not distinguish the situation when , e.g. , local results are @xmath76 ( for the respective observers ) , with the one when the results are @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , an analysis of the results of the first two parties conditioned on the third party receiving e.g. @xmath5 , can lead to a more stringent constraint on local realism . and",
    "this is exactly what we have received here .",
    "note that no sequential measurements are involved ( the third party performs just one measurement ) .",
    "communication between the parties is only after the experiment , just to collect the data .    for the @xmath33 state",
    ", this refinement of data analysis seems to be optimal . to test the ultimate critical value for @xmath29",
    ", we employed the numerical procedure based on linear optimization , which tests whether the full set of _ probabilities _ involved in a @xmath0 particle experiment admits an underlying local realistic model .",
    "the procedure has been described in many works @xcite , and therefore will not be given here .",
    "since the program analyzes the full set of _ probabilities _ , its verdict is based on the _ full _ set of data available in the bell experiment .",
    "the program has found that bell type experiments on a noisy @xmath33 state have always a local realistic description for @xmath29 below the numerical threshold of @xmath78 .",
    "that is , we have a full agreement , up to the numerical accuracy , with the result given in eq .",
    "( [ vis3 ] ) .      for the @xmath79 ,",
    "the above phenomenon gets even more pronounced . the sufficient condition for the local realistic description ( [ suff ] ) , can be shown to be satisfied for @xmath80 the method that we have used to get ( [ nwwwzb ] ) is the straightforward generalization of the euler rotations method to the @xmath0 qubit case . since @xmath81 explicit local realistic models for the @xmath0 qubit correlation functions ( in a standard bell experiment , involving pairs of alternative observables at each site ) exists for large @xmath0 for @xmath29 as high as @xmath82 .",
    "we have also numerically found the threshold value of @xmath83 , above which at least one of the correlation function bell inequalities is violated .",
    "it does not differ too much from the right hand side of ( [ nwwwzb ] ) and e.g. for @xmath84 , it reads @xmath85 and for @xmath86 , it is @xmath87 .",
    "however the more refined method of data analysis leads to different results .",
    "imagine now that the last @xmath3 observers have the @xmath88 observable within their local pair of alternative observables in the bell test .",
    "then if all of them get the @xmath5 result , the collapsed state will be given by @xmath89 with the 2-qubit state @xmath90 being @xmath91 where @xmath92 since for @xmath93 , no local realistic description of this subset of data is possible , the critical visibility @xmath83 , which does not allow a local realistic model reads @xmath94 note that @xmath95 when @xmath96 .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath0 the decrease has an exponential character ! this behavior is strickingly different than the one for the threshold value of @xmath83 which is sufficient to satisfy the @xmath0 qubit correlation function bell inequalities ( fig .",
    "[ crit ] ) .",
    "( -110,-8)number of qubits ( -195,140)critical ( -195,130)visibility    for low @xmath0 , the value of @xmath97 was confirmed by the numerical procedure @xcite mentioned earlier ( which analyzes the full set of data for the problem ) .",
    "the critical numerical values are @xmath98 , which is exactly equal to the @xmath99-digit approximation of the @xmath100 value given by ( [ n|2 ] ) , and @xmath101 , which is equal to the @xmath102-digit approximation of @xmath103 of ( [ n|2 ] ) .",
    "this suggests a conjecture that ( [ n|2 ] ) is the real threshold .",
    "however if this is untrue , the decrease in @xmath83 must be even bigger !",
    "the ghz states exhibit maximal violations of the correlation function bell inequalities @xcite , and the violations when measured by the threshold visibility @xmath104 exhibit an exponential behavior . let us now compare these two families .",
    "a noisy @xmath0 particle ghz state , given by @xmath105 violates correlation function bell inequalities whenever @xmath106 we have performed for @xmath107 the numerical analysis of the possibility of the existence of a local realistic model for the full set of data for ghz correlations , and the returned numerical critical values fully agree with this value . for @xmath108 , @xmath109 of ( [ n|2 ] ) for the @xmath1 states is lower than the one for ghz ones .",
    "the @xmath110 or more qubit @xmath1 state violate local realism more strongly than their ghz counterparts , and this increases exponentially .",
    "it may seem that the ghz states will regain their glory of being the most nonclassical ones , if one introduces more alternative measurements , than just two , for each observer .",
    "however let us note that there exists a sequence of functional bell inequalities @xcite for @xmath0 qubits , which involve the entire range of local measurements in one plane . we will now show that even if we consider these functional bell inequalities , the @xmath1 states remain more nonclassical than the ghz states . but",
    "before that , we first briefly discuss the functional bell inequalities .",
    "the functional bell inequalities @xcite essentially follow from a simple geometric observation that in any real vector space , if for two vectors @xmath111 and @xmath112 one has @xmath113 , then this immediately implies that @xmath114 . in simple words ,",
    "if the scalar product of two vectors has a lower value than the length of one of them , then the two vectors can not be equal .",
    "let @xmath115 be a state shared between @xmath0 separated parties .",
    "let @xmath116 be an arbitrary observable at the @xmath117th location ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the quantum mechanical prediction @xmath119 for the correlation in the state @xmath115 , when these observables are measured , is @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the aggregate of the local parameters at the @xmath117th site .",
    "our object is to see whether this prediction can be reproduced in a local hidden variable theory .",
    "a local hidden variable correlation in the present scenario must be of the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the distribution of the local hidden variables and @xmath124 is the predetermined measurement - result of the observable @xmath125 corresponding to the hidden variable @xmath126 .",
    "consider now the scalar product @xmath127 and the norm @xmath128 if we can prove that a strict inequality holds , namely for all possible @xmath129 , one has @xmath130 with the number @xmath131 , we will immediately have @xmath132 , indicating that the correlations in the state @xmath115 are of a different character than in any local realistic theory .",
    "we then could say that the state @xmath115 violates the  functional \" bell inequality ( [ star ] ) , as this bell inequality is expressed in terms of a typical scalar product for square integrable functions .",
    "note that the value of the product depends on a continuous range of parameters ( of the measuring apparatuses ) at each site .",
    "the critical visibility for which the ghz state violates the functional bell inequalities @xcite is lower than that for which it violates the multiqubit two - settings bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "precisely , the critical visibility above which a functional bell inequality is violated by an @xmath0-qubit ghz state , is @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "this is obtained for measurement settings in the @xmath134 planes for all observers sharing the ghz state .",
    "this critical visibility is better than that for violation of the multiqubit bell inequalities for @xmath135 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath1 family leads to stronger violations of local realism for @xmath136 ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ n|2 ] ) ) .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath1 states do not violate the functional bell inequalities involving all settings in one plane for @xmath137 .",
    "it may seem that the results obtained in section [ section - comparison - lhv ] depend on the fact that the ghz state has an equal number of @xmath139s and @xmath140s , when expressed in the @xmath88 basis , while the @xmath1-state has an asymmetry in this respect . in this section , we show that this is not the case .",
    "consider for example the @xmath0 ( @xmath141 ) qubit state @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath143 is obtained by interchanging @xmath6 and @xmath140 in @xmath144 .",
    "for @xmath145 , we define @xmath146 .",
    "this state ( @xmath147 ) has an equal number of @xmath6s and @xmath140s , just as in the ghz states .",
    "now consider the state @xmath148 admixed with white noise , @xmath149 in a similar process as described before , if @xmath3 parties make measurements in the @xmath88 basis and when all of them obtain @xmath150 or all of them obtain @xmath5 , the state obtained at the remaining two parties is the ( two - qubit ) werner state ( similarly as in eq . ( [ eq_projected ] ) ) @xmath151 with @xmath152 we can then proceed just as we did in section [ section - comparison - lhv ] , in the case of @xmath1 state .",
    "the state @xmath153 has no local realistic description for @xmath154 and this implies that the state @xmath155 cannnot have a local realistic model for @xmath156 for @xmath157 , @xmath158 therefore for @xmath157 , the @xmath138 states also violate local realism more strongly than ghz states .",
    "however the nonclassicality in the g - states is less pronounced than that in the w - states . for the @xmath1 states , the cross - over was at @xmath159 ( see section [ section - comparison - lhv ] ) .",
    "the method of data analysis presented above implies another difference between the @xmath1 states and the ghz states . for a noisy ghz state ,",
    "if one of the observers performs a measurement in the basis @xmath160 , the projected state , has for the other @xmath161 observers again the form of a noisy ghz state , and the visibility parameter is the _ same _ as before .",
    "further , after @xmath3 observers perform measurements in this basis , whatever are their results , the last two observers share a noisy bell state , with the same visibility as the original noisy ghz state . in contrast , noisy ( @xmath0-qubit ) @xmath1 states , upon a measurement of @xmath88 , by the first observer , resulting in @xmath5 , lead to a noisy @xmath1 state @xmath162 , for the remaining @xmath161 observers , of _ increased visibility _ , namely to @xmath163 with @xmath164 the other result , @xmath150 , leads to a separable mixture of @xmath165 with white noise .",
    "if one s aim is to get a bell state in the hands of just two observers of the required ( high ) visibility , say at least @xmath166 , then this can always be achieved with some probability by taking a noisy @xmath1 state of sufficiently many qubits , and performing @xmath3 measurements of @xmath88 on @xmath3 qubits .",
    "the success is conditioned on all results being @xmath5 . for the given @xmath166 ,",
    "the noisy @xmath1 state of visibility @xmath83 must be for the number of qubits , @xmath0 , for which @xmath167 therefore if one s aim is to have a bell state between two observers with as high visibility as possible , one can send through a noisy channel a @xmath18 state . from the noisy @xmath18 state , in a probabilistic way",
    ", one can extract a high visibility bell state .",
    "no such possibility exists for the ghz state .",
    "consider now the situations when a large number of copies of the @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 state and ghz state are separately sent through a depolarizing channel of visibility @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath18 , using the method of projections , one is able to obtain with probability @xmath169 a bell state of visibility ( see eq .",
    "( [ n|2a ] ) ) @xmath170 for the state @xmath171 , one obtains with unit probability a bell state with the original visibility @xmath168 .",
    "we will now compare the yield of singlets in these two situations , by using ( in both cases ) two different protocols for distilling the resulting two - qubit state , obtained after the specific projections on the multiqubit states .      using the one - way hashing protocol for distillation @xcite , the per copy yield of singlets ( of arbitrarily high fidelity ) is @xmath172 for the state @xmath18 and @xmath173 for the state @xmath171 , where @xmath174 and @xmath175 is the von neumann entropy of @xmath176 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ yield ] ( for @xmath177 ) , the yield for the @xmath1 state is better for a large range of @xmath168 than that for the ghz state .",
    "this feature remains for all @xmath0 and gets pronounced with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "even for @xmath178 , there is a small range of @xmath168 , in which the yield of singlets is higher for the @xmath1 state . and",
    "importantly , the ranges in which the @xmath1 states are better are for _ higher _ levels of noise .",
    "similar features are obtained for _ two - way _ distillable entanglement .",
    "for example , although one - way distillable entanglement is vanishing for @xmath179 , the two - way recurrence - hashing distillation protocol gives a positive yield @xcite . to get @xmath179 from ,",
    "say @xmath180 , the visibility in the depolarizing channel can be as low as @xmath181 ( this value is obtained by putting @xmath182 and @xmath183 in eq .",
    "( [ lagey - tuk ] ) . ) for the same visibility in the channel , @xmath184 produces the _ separable _",
    "state @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "we therefore obtain a _ qualitative _ difference between the @xmath1 state and the ghz state in this respect .",
    "( -100,-8)critical visibility ( -195,128)yield",
    "looking at the projected state can also serve as a simple entanglement witness .",
    "the state @xmath186 where @xmath187 is a normalized density matrix , is separable for @xcite @xmath188 choosing @xmath187 as the @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 state and using eq .",
    "( [ n|2a ] ) , one obtains an upper bound @xmath189 of the radius @xmath190 of the separable ball ( as a noisy bell state is separable for @xmath191 @xcite ) , which is of the same order as obtained in ref .",

    "<S> the considerations provide us with a _ qualitative _ difference between the @xmath1 state and ghz state in the situation when they are separately sent via depolarizing channels . for sufficiently high amount of noise in the depolarizing channel </S>",
    "<S> , the ghz states can not produce a distillable state between two qubits , whereas the @xmath1 states can still produce a distillable state in a similar situation . </S>"
