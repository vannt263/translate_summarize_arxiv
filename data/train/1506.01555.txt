    "quantum teleportation @xcite is the most fundamental protocol in quantum information science , and indeed has always played a crucial role in the progress of quantum information theory and technology ( for a good review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the standard teleportation scheme ( sts ) @xcite transfers an unknown quantum state from alice to bob as follows : alice performs a joint measurement on the state to be teleported and half of the previously shared entangled state , tells the outcome of the measurement to bob , and bob applies a unitary transformation , depending on the outcome , to the remaining half of the entangled state . to ensure no - signaling ( no faster than light communication ) ,",
    "every teleportation scheme must accompany some sort of communication and bob s operation depending on the communication content .    in so - called port - based teleportation ( pbt )",
    "@xcite , bob s operation is quite simple : he regards his half of ( large ) entangled state as a collection of @xmath0 output ports , and he only picks up an output port ( and discards all the other ports ) .",
    "the output port contains the teleported state as it is , without any correcting operation on the output port .",
    "the absence of the correcting operation leads to an application of pbt as a universal programmable quantum processor @xcite , which is a device to play back the record of the ( past ) experiences of a quantum object .",
    "the universality of the device is so powerful that arbitrary experiences can be recoded and played back ( just like a machine in science fiction to relive your childhood ) , including not only those described as unitary evolution but also measurements ( working as a quantum multimeter @xcite in this case ) .",
    "the drawback is that huge amount of entanglement is necessary to increase the fidelity or success probability .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the most of the huge amount of entanglement can be recycled for subsequent pbt @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in @xcite that a combined protocol of pbt and sts works as if it could break the barrier of spacetime as follows : suppose that alice and bob , separated in spacetime , each has a quantum system @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "alice can then consider , _ without waiting for communication _ , that a port of her half of the shared entangled state contains the state of @xmath3 , i.e. she already has the non - local state of @xmath3 somewhere in her hand ( though she can know which port contains the state only after the communication from bob ) @xcite .",
    "this technique is used for attacking position - based cryptography and for instantaneous non - local quantum computation @xcite .",
    "moreover , pbt has been used as a tool to investigate the relation of quantum communication complexity and the bell non - locality @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of pbt have not been completely clarified yet , in particular , for teleporting a high dimensional quantum state .",
    "this is because , in contrast to sts , the simple multiple use of pbt for a qubit ( quantum bit ) does not result in pbt for higher dimension . for teleporting a state of a qudit ( @xmath4-dimensional system ) , only a lower bound of the teleportation fidelity of deterministic pbt @xcite and an upper bound of the success probability of probabilistic pbt @xcite",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "to begin with , let us recall the formulation of ( deterministic ) pbt , where bob has @xmath0 output ports and a teleported state appears in one of the @xmath0 ports without any correcting operation on each port . as a preparation of pbt , bob has @xmath0 qudits : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where each corresponds to the output port of pbt . in this paper , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13",
    "are denoted by @xmath14 as a whole .",
    "alice also has @xmath0 qudits : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath17 , which are denoted by @xmath18 as a whole .",
    "let us then describe an entangled state between @xmath18 and @xmath14 used for pbt as @xmath19-spins ( @xmath20 ) , and @xmath4 and @xmath21 will be used interchangeably .",
    "the spin basis is denoted by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath12 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "then , @xmath25 is a state of spin 0 in two @xmath24-spins , which is maximally entangled between the two .",
    "the operator @xmath26 specifies the actual form of @xmath27 , and @xmath28 so that @xmath27 is normalized .",
    "note that , in pbt , the teleportation fidelity is maximized when @xmath29 in general , i.e. when @xmath27 is not maximally entangled .    to teleport the state of the @xmath30 qudit , alice performs a joint measurement with @xmath0 possible outcomes ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath12 , @xmath0 ) on the @xmath18 and @xmath30 qudits .",
    "let us denote the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) of her measurement by @xmath33 and hence @xmath34 . when alice obtains the outcome @xmath35 , the state of @xmath36 qudit is close to the state of the @xmath30 qudit as it is .",
    "it is then found that the entanglement fidelity of pbt is given by @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 @xmath39 , and @xmath40 denotes the @xmath18 qudits except for @xmath41 ( i.e. @xmath42 ) .    in analyzing the properties of pbt , the following operator : @xmath43 frequently plays a crucial role . indeed , alice s optimal measurement in the case of @xmath6 and @xmath44 is the square - root measurement ( srm ) @xcite [ also known as a pretty good measurement ( pgm ) or least - squares measurement ( lsm ) @xcite ] for distinguishing the quantum signals @xmath45 , and the corresponding entanglement fidelity is given by @xmath46    to investigate the general properties of @xmath47 , let us decompose @xmath48 into the spin components : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an identity on the subspace where the total spin angular momentum of @xmath51 is @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the possible minimum value ) .",
    "then , @xmath47 is also decomposed into @xmath54 since the addition of spin 0 and spin @xmath52 results in spin @xmath52 only , each term @xmath55 is an operator on the subspace of total spin @xmath52 ( though the spin function constructed by the addition is different , depending on @xmath35 ) , and hence @xmath56 is also an operator on the subspace of total spin @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 for @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath47 is block diagonal with respect to the total spin angular momentum ( and clearly its @xmath59-component also ) of @xmath60 spins ( @xmath61 ) , but the maximum momentum is limited to @xmath62 .    as far as we know ,",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath47 for @xmath63 have not been obtained yet , which leads to the difficulty in analyzing pbt in higher dimension .",
    "the only exception is the maximum eigenvalue , which is proved in appendix [ sec : maximum eigenvalue of rho ] to be @xmath64 this leads to a known monogamy relation of singlet fraction @xcite for a multipartite state @xmath65 such that @xmath66 which explains the fidelity limit of symmetric @xmath67 universal cloning @xcite in a simpler way .",
    "fortunately , all the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath47 for @xmath6 can be analytically obtained as we showed in @xcite , but the results are not simple . therefore , it may be worth to summarize it again in a tractable way .",
    "a special property held for @xmath6 is that the spin angular mometum of the @xmath18 spins ( denoted by @xmath68 hereafter ) is a good quantum number , i.e. @xmath47 is block diagonal with respect to @xmath68 also .",
    "indeed , @xmath56 for @xmath6 is written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an identity on the subspace where total spin angular momentum of @xmath61 is @xmath52 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that , since the total spin of @xmath52 is the result of the addition of @xmath68 and @xmath72-spin of @xmath30 , @xmath73 holds .",

    "( [ eq : srm ] ) in many cases : both @xmath44 and optimal @xmath26 in the deterministic version , and optimal @xmath26 in the probabilistic version .",
    "the only exception is the case of @xmath44 in the probabilistic version .",
    "this seems to rely on the property that @xmath47 is block diagonal with respect to @xmath68 .",
    "unfortunately , this property does not hold for general @xmath4 as shown in appendix [ sec : s=1 ] , where the result of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is explicitly shown .",
    "it is quit interesting that , even in this case , the optimal measurement of probabilistic pbt again agrees with srm for distinguishing @xmath45 .",
    "according to the no - go theorem for the faithful and deterministic universal programmable processor @xcite , a deterministic pbt protocol is inevitably forced to be an approximate one for finite @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it may be convenient if , for the same measurement of alice , bob can lately choose between two choices : ( 1 ) usual pbt ( with non - unit fidelity ) by selecting one of the @xmath0 output ports or ( 2 ) faithful teleportation ( with unit fidelity ) by utilizing all the @xmath0 output ports .",
    "this protocol , say recoverable pbt , is indeed possible as shown below .    to this end , let us consider the optimal probabilistic pbt for @xmath6 to teleport the @xmath30 qubit of @xmath91 .",

    "this implies that , if bob knows the outcome of the measurement [ denoted by @xmath102 and he applies an appropriate unitary transformation on @xmath14 according to the outcome , he can completely recover the state of @xmath30 in his hand .",
    "note that , this does not work well for even @xmath0 , because @xmath103 is not maximally entangled for @xmath104 .",
    "to summarize , the explicit protocol of recoverable pbt is as follows : alice performs a measurement @xmath105 on @xmath61 as in the case of optimal probabilistic pbt and obtains the outcome @xmath35 . when she obtains @xmath106 , she further performs the measurement in the basis of eq .",
