    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a unique gauge theory in that its nonperturbative phenomena are experimentally observable and thus one can test our understanding on nonperturbative dynamics quantitatively . understanding the underlying principles of nonperturbative dynamics",
    "is not only important in its own right but also interesting because it could provide a solid basis for studying other hypothetical strong coupling gauge theories .    in this paper",
    ", we address chiral phase transition of massless two - flavor qcd at vanishing density .",
    "this system is obviously different from qcd in real world as it consists of massive flavors , and hence studying this system may be considered to be academic . on the other hand , since this system can be seen as one of extreme cases of real qcd , precise knowledge on this system could provide with foundations for understanding phase diagrams of real qcd as a function of chemical potential , quark masses , or the number of flavors , etc .    the order of chiral phase transition of massless two flavor qcd has been studied in uncountably many works both analytically and numerically , but not settled yet  @xcite .",
    "one of analytical methods is to examine the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the corresponding landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory . in 1983 ,",
    "pisarski and wilczek revisited the @xmath4 functions of linear sigma models ( lsms ) calculated in the @xmath2 expansion and classified by the resulting rg flow the nature of chiral phase transition of qcd with arbitrary number of massless flavors  @xcite .",
    "however , the two flavor case remained uncertain because two distinct effective theories are possible , depending on the presence of flavor singlet axial [ @xmath0 ] symmetry at the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) , and they draw different conclusions .    in the case where a large @xmath0 symmetry breaking remains at @xmath1 , @xmath3 lsm should be analyzed .",
    "@xmath6 lsm has been well studied again both analytically and numerically , and the existence of the stable infrared fixed point ( irfp ) , or the wilson - fisher fixed point , is established .",
    "on the other hand , when the @xmath0 symmetry is effectively and fully restored at @xmath1 , the symmetry of the system turns to @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) .",
    "this case has been also studied through various methods and is attracting attention  @xcite .",
    "it appears that the nature of the transition in this system is still under debate .",
    "numerical simulations based on lattice qcd can directly determine the nature of the transition of massless two - flavor qcd without any assumption , in principle .",
    "interestingly , a possibility of first order phase transition is recently reported in one of the lattice calculations  @xcite , while there remain many systematic uncertainties to be checked .    in this work",
    ", we will not pursue whether the @xmath7 model has an irfp or not , and would rather focus on the case where the @xmath0 symmetry breaking is small but finite at @xmath1 .",
    "although the size of the symmetry breaking at @xmath1 is determined by nonperturbative dynamics and its precise value is not known yet , it is probable from recent studies that the breaking effect is not large  @xcite .",
    "this system is interesting from the field theoretical viewpoint .",
    "@xmath7 lsm contains eight degenerate scalar fields , and by introducing the breaking , half of them gain mass proportional to the breaking .",
    "when the size of breaking is infinitely large , the system is simply reduced to the @xmath3 lsm and will end up with second order phase transition  @xcite . even if the breaking is tiny",
    ", we expect that the massive degrees of freedom will decouple from the system and @xmath3 lsm is eventually realized as the flow goes into the infrared limit",
    ". however , we are concerned that the decoupling theorem  @xcite is not obvious in three dimensions because the scalar quartic couplings have a mass dimension .",
    "for example , four - point green s functions can , in general , have a term like @xmath9 due to massive fields with a mass @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents a typical scale of external momenta and @xmath12 is an effective quartic coupling connecting light and heavy fields . in three dimensions",
    ", @xmath12 has a mass dimension , and whether @xmath9 vanishes in the @xmath13 limit is determined by @xmath14 dependence of the running of @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , the presence of non - decoupling effects is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a theory with a dimensionful scalar cubic coupling is examined in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "it is thus interesting to see in the context of the rg flow how or even whether the decoupling occurs .",
    "we take the @xmath2 expansion approach to study this system since the @xmath2 is suitable for investigating the detailed structure of the decoupling on a fundamental level .",
    "the calculation is done mainly in a mass - dependent renormalization scheme such that @xmath4 functions contain information on finite mass of would - be decoupling particles .",
    "the consistency with the @xmath16 scheme is checked through the calculation of four - point correlation function . as for other parts",
    ", we simply follow the standard . with @xmath4 functions",
    "thus obtained , we determine the attractive basin flowing into the @xmath3 ( or wilson - fisher ) fixed point and see how the area of the basin is affected by the size of the @xmath0 breaking .",
    "we point out that , although the effective theory starting from the inside of the attractive basin eventually reaches the @xmath3 fixed point , one of the universal exponents turns out to differ from that of the standard @xmath3 lsm .",
    "we present the reason for this peculiarity and propose a novel possibility for chiral phase transition in two - flavor qcd , that is second order phase transition with , say , the @xmath0 broken scaling .",
    "the same system has been studied in the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the phase transition in the presence of a finite @xmath0 breaking is concluded to be of first order . since the @xmath4 functions calculated in the @xmath2 expansion are embedded in the frg , the same conclusion is naively expected to be reached .",
    "however , our conclusion is different from theirs . determining the order of the chiral phase transition of massless two - flavor qcd has some impact on models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with electroweak baryogenesis . for an attempt on the lattice ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our analysis is performed at the leading order of the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "thus , our findings may be significantly affected by higher orders in the expansion .",
    "furthermore , it is pointed out that the @xmath2 expansion is sometimes not useful even for qualitative discussions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the @xmath2 expansion suffices for exploring possible scenarios and making a survey of how the decoupling of massive fields occurs along the flow toward the infrared limit .",

    "thus , it is confirmed that the @xmath11 dependence of the four - point function agrees between two schemes .      here",
    "let us explore reasons for the different approaching rate .",
    "the reason seems to be simply originating from the fact that the quartic couplings describing interactions between the light @xmath51 and heavy @xmath150 fields have a mass dimension in three dimensional theory .    the contribution of massive fields ( @xmath150 ) with a mass @xmath10 to a renormalized green s function of light fields ( @xmath90 ) at external momentum @xmath11 will take the form of @xmath151 when @xmath152 , where @xmath153 represents a generic dimensionless quartic coupling and is related to the coupling in lagrangian as @xmath154",
    "this is indeed seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g4_msbar ] ) , if one expands the logarithmic term assuming @xmath155 .    if @xmath156 ( or @xmath157 ) , @xmath151 will vanish as @xmath13 because @xmath158 depends on @xmath11 , at most , logarithmically , but when @xmath159 ( or @xmath18 ) , it does not in general because the factor @xmath14 can be compensated by @xmath158 , which behaves @xmath160 at the tree level .",
    "thus , in general , the decoupling theorem does not hold when a coupling has a mass dimension .",
    "the same conclusion is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where non - decoupling effects of the scalar cubic interaction in 3 + 1 dimensions is studied .",
    "another and more important reason is below .",
    "usually , the approaching rate is argued in terms of more familiar quantity , @xmath161 , defined by @xmath162 which is one of the universal exponents .",
    "the above results yield @xmath163 for the @xmath3 and the @xmath0 broken lsm , respectively .    according to the general argument of renormalization group ,",
    "@xmath161 is determined by the rg dimension of the leading irrelevant operator in a model under consideration .",
    "while @xmath164 is the one in the @xmath3 lsm , it is not evident in the @xmath0 broken lsm but should not be the same as the @xmath3 lsm because @xmath165 .",
    "one possible candidate is @xmath166 , which should become eventually irrelevant since its effects to the low energy behavior is expected to vanish as @xmath52 decouples from the system . since the coefficient of @xmath166 term is @xmath75 ,",
    "we calculate @xmath161 with @xmath167 as a trial and obtain @xmath168 .",
    "then , it is concluded from this observation that the operator @xmath166 effectively plays a role of the leading irrelevant operator in the @xmath0 broken lsm .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 broken lsm is the system which is invariant under @xmath3 rotation for @xmath51 in the ir limit , but does not obey the @xmath3 scaling .",
    "it is important to notice that our study suggests a novel possibility for the nature of chiral phase transition of two - flavor qcd .",
    "currently , three possibilities remains : ( i ) first order ( ii ) second order with the @xmath3 scaling ( iii ) second order with the @xmath39 scaling .",
    "we suggests the new one : ( iv ) second order with , say , the @xmath0 broken scaling .",
    "the nature of the chiral phase transition of massless two - flavor qcd depends on the fate of @xmath0 symmetry at the critical temperature .",
    "two extreme cases with infinitely large and vanishing @xmath0 breaking have been well studied relying on effective theories and seem to have their respective irfp although the latter is not settled yet .",
    "we have studied the case with a finite @xmath0 breaking .",
    "the rg flow of @xmath39 lsm with a finite @xmath0 breaking is investigated in the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "it turns out that if the couplings start from a certain region , _ i.e. _ attractive basin , one of the couplings flows into the same fixed point as the one in @xmath3 lsm although the approaching rate is different from the @xmath3 case .",
    "the interpretation of this is that the @xmath0 broken lsm approaches the @xmath3 lsm in the ir limit via the decoupling of the massive fields .",
    "the attractive basin flowing into the @xmath3 fixed point shrinks as @xmath49 decreases .",
    "thus , for smaller @xmath49 , the phase transition of massless two flavor qcd favors the first order phase transition more than the second .",
    "the observed discrepancy in the approaching rate is caused by the non - decoupling effect .",
    "in other words , the decoupling rate of the massive fields is slower than the approaching rate in the standard @xmath3 lsm , and it effectively changes the rg dimension of the leading irrelevant operator through @xmath169 . in order to establish the non - decoupling ,",
    "it is clearly interesting to calculate the other critical exponents and compare with those of the @xmath3 lsm .",
    "the existence of an irfp just satisfies a necessary condition for second order phase transition .",
    "the phase transition can be more clearly investigated by calculating the effective potential .",
    "such a study is ongoing  @xcite .",
    "the analysis here consists of simple one - loop calculations , and hence the results are neither quantitative nor conclusive .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that this simple analysis is still useful to explore possible scenarios and offers a good starting point for further study .",
