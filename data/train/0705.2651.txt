    "molecules can easily form in large abundance in the cool atmospheres of agb stars and initiate a relatively complex chemistry that is further enhanced by photodissociation in the cse . however , most of the abundance estimates are based on rather simple methods and are typically order of magnitude estimates .",
    "the first two more detailed studies of circumstellar abundances in larger samples of sources have been performed by @xcite and @xcite for sio in 45 m - type ( c / o@xmath41 in the photosphere ) agb stars and 19 carbon stars ( c / o@xmath51 in the photosphere ) , respectively .",
    "average sio fractional abundances were obtained from a detailed ( non - local and nlte ) radiative transfer analysis of multi - transition single - dish observations .",
    "interestingly , for the m - type agb stars the derived abundances are generally much lower than expected from photospheric equilibrium chemistry . for the carbon stars , on the other hand , the derived abundances are on the average two orders of magnitude higher than predicted by photospheric equilibrium chemistry .",
    "moreover , there is a clear trend that the sio fractional abundance decreases as the mass - loss rate of the star increases , as would be the case if sio is accreted onto dust grains .",
    "recently , high - spatial - resolution interferometric sio line observations have been published of the two m - type agb stars r  dor and l@xmath6  pup by @xcite and the carbon star irc+10216 by @xcite .",
    "in addition , new sio data have been obtained for iras 151945115 , r cas , ik tau , r  crt ( see fig .  1 ) , irc10529 , irc+10365 , gx mon , and w hya using atca and vla ( schier et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . a detailed excitation analysis reveal the presence of an inner compact component of high fractional abundance ( see fig .  1 ; right panel ) , consistent with predictions from stellar atmosphere chemistry in the case of the m - type objects but several orders of magnitude larger than expected for the carbon stars , indicating the importance of non - lte chemical processes as suggested by recent chemical models @xcite .",
    "in addition , an extended low - abundance component , as expected if sio is effectively depleted onto grains in the inner wind , was required in order to fit the observations in all cases .",
    "consequently , there are strong indications that circumstellar sio line emission carries information on the properties of the region where the mass loss of agb stars is initiated . however , our knowledge of the relative importance of freeze - out onto dust grains , photodissociation , and circumstellar chemistry is still rudimentary .",
    "higher spatial resolution observations and additional progress on chemical models , including grains , are needed for further progress ."

    "<S> this is consistent with a scenario where sio freezes out onto dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> the region of the wind with low abundance is much more extended , typically @xmath01@xmath110@xmath3 cm , and limited by photodissociation . </S>",
