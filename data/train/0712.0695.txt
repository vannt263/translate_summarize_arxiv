    "in the last years advanced laser facilities have achieved intensities of the order of @xmath0 and pulse lengths of the order of 10 fs . , which corresponds to few cycles of an electrical field of 800 nm wavelength @xcite .",
    "the process of interaction of such short and strong pulses with matter is a topic which has attracted much interest recently .    in the multiphoton regime , many experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite have been performed . in the tunneling regime ,",
    "on the other hand , recent experiments @xcite with linearly polarized lasers have shown structures in the momentum distribution of the photoionized electrons in rare gases which have not been fully understood so far .",
    "the role of interference in few - cycle pulses is actually been both theoretically and experimentally investigated @xcite .    moreover , the combined laser and charged particle induced electronic processes either in ion - atom or ion - surface collisions are of considerable interest both for basic and applied sciences @xcite . from the fundamental point of view",
    "they might broaden our general understanding of the dynamics of atomic processes for laser - matter interactions and field - free collisions .",
    "as for the applications these studies can help us to find the way for the control of ultrashort quantum processes which are important in a number of applications , like in laser - driven fusion , in plasma heating , or in the development of fast optical electronic devices .",
    "the dynamics of atomic processes for the above mentioned interactions are not fully understood due to the lack of the exact and efficient theoretical models . for a detailed understanding of processes",
    "involved in the laser - matter interaction one needs to solve the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for an atomic system in the radiation field , but its exact analytical solution is not known .",
    "several numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation for these kinds of systems are known @xcite , but they are very time consuming for large systems and at high radiation intensities they converge slowly . to overcome this problem there are several theoretical approaches , which are based on the simplification of the tdse using different approximations depending on the laser field parameters .    at low and moderate laser field",
    "intensities the time dependent perturbation theory ( tdpt ) is a well suited approximation for single- and multi - photon processes and even for the above threshold ionization @xcite . in this case",
    "the tdse is solved by considering the interaction between the laser field and the studied atomic system as a perturbation .",
    "the tdpt approach breaks down at higher laser intensities when it fails to describe the `` peak suppression '' in the above threshold ionization spectra @xcite .    at higher laser field intensities",
    "other non - perturbative processes emerge like high harmonics generation , tunneling ionization ( ti ) , over the barrier ionization ( obi ) , which can not be described using tdpt and other approaches are necessary .",
    "time independent , stationary approaches are developed based on the floquet theory @xcite . in the framework of the generalized floquet theory a stationary treatment of a periodic or quasiperiodic tdse is possible .",
    "the tdse is reduced to a set of time - independent coupled equations or into a floquet matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "approaches involving the floquet theory are applied successfully to describe multiphoton excitation , above threshold ionization and dissociation , but their main disadvantage is that in most applications the analytical form of the involved floquet states is not known and their numerical calculation is also time consuming .",
    "the most frequently used approaches are based on the keldysh theory @xcite .",
    "the keldysh theory is based on the assumption that on the final state wavefunction only the external laser field has a dominant influence and it can be considered as a momentum eigenstate .",
    "the main shortcoming of the keldys theory is that it completely neglects the long ranged coulomb interaction between the ionized electron and remaining target ion .",
    "the coulomb interaction leads to phenomena like sub - peaks in the above threshold ionization spectra @xcite , asymmetry in the spatial distribution of the ejected electron even for a symmetric few - cycle laser pulses @xcite , which can not be explained in the simplified keldysh formalism .",
    "there are two possible ways of including the coulomb interaction in the keldysh formalism .",
    "the first one is by making corrections in the transition matrix , and the second one is by making corrections in the volkov wavefunction .",
    "approaches based on the keldysh theory using these corrections are applied with considerable success to study multiphoton and tunneling ionization of atomic systems @xcite .    in the recent years",
    "the coulomb - volkov ( cv ) wavefunctions were used to describe processes in the presence of intense ultrashort laser field @xcite .",
    "the coulomb - volkov wavefunctions were introduced by jain and tzoar in 1978 @xcite to describe laser assisted collisions . later on they were successfully applied to describe multiphoton and above threshold ionization @xcite .",
    "the coulomb - volkov wavefunctions are also used to study ionization in tunneling and in over the barrier regime in the framework of sudden approximation @xcite .",
    "this model is called coulomb - volkov model    the accuracy of the results provided by the cv model is limited by the sudden approximation ( it provides accurate results only if the pulse duration is less then two orbital period of the active electron @xcite ) and by the fact that the cv wavefunctions are only an approximate solution of the tdse for charged particle in the presence of external radiation field . from these two main limitations",
    "the first one is more restrictive , because it is limiting to the pulse duration in the attosecond region .",
    "our goal is to construct a theoretical model , which provides results as good as or better than the cv model , but which does not have the limitation in pulse duration .",
    "our approach is based on the approximate solution of the tdse for quantum systems with one active electron , where the coulomb interaction between the electron and the remaining target ion can be considered as a perturbation during the external laser pulse .",
    "the time dependent wavefunction of the active electron is expanded in terms of volkov wavefunctions .",
    "the equation for the expansion coefficients obtained from the tdse is solved with this approximation .    the ionization process in the over the barrier regime is considered to be a classical one and it is believed that it can be described very well by classical models like classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) @xcite .",
    "we present double differential ionization cross sections for different laser pulses using the present , ctmc and volkov models .",
    "the ionization probability densities are presented as a function of the electron energy and ejection angle .    in several works",
    "@xcite the effect of the coulomb interaction on the ionization of the hydrogen atom by ultrashort laser pulses at different field intensities using different approaches is studied . in these studies",
    "the effect of the coulomb potential is studied by employing different types of final state wavefunctions like the coulomb - volkov wavefunction @xcite , or first and second order coulomb corrected volkov wavefunctions @xcite , or by employing coulomb corrections on the keldysh - faisal - reiss theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effect of the coulom potential on the overall ionization process is also investigated .    in the present paper",
    "we study the effect of the coulomb potential during and after the laser pulse by analyzing the angular distribution of the electrons at given energies ( extracted from the double differential cross section ) and the ionization probability density ( calculated from the double differential cross section by integration over the ejection angles ) using various model calculations .",
    "the dependence of the angular distribution of photoelectrons on the ejection energy allow us to investigate the transition between a quantum type and a classical type ionization also studied by dimitrovski and solovev @xcite in the framework of the first magnus approximation .",

    "more differences were identified by analyzing the angular distribution of the ejected electrons . for low energy electrons major discrepancies",
    "have been found between ctmc and first order results , because the ionization of this low energy electrons is a quantum process , which can not be described in a classical approach . at higher electron energies ,",
    "the observed discrepancies disappear leading to the conclusion that the ionization process of the high energy electrons can be described classically . at low energies",
    ", differences were also observed between the first order and volkov results , which disappeared at higher electron energies indicating that during the ionization electrons with higher energies are less influenced by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the same observation was made by analyzing the ionization probability densities , where significant differences between the volkov and first order results were observed for low energy photoelectrons .",
    "a simple explanation for this behavior was found by considering the possible classical trajectories of the electrons during the ionization .",
    "similar conclusion was also drawn by zhang et .",
    "@xcite in their study , where they found that the influence of the coulomb interaction depends mainly on the energy of the photoelectrons rather than on the laser field intensities .    the influence of the coulomb potential during and after the laser pulse was studied .",
    "for short laser pulses with low momentum transfer we found that the coulomb potential has an important role after the laser pulse is switched off . in the case of longer pulses , with low momentum transfer ,",
    "the coulomb potential is equally important during and after the pulse , while in the case of high momentum transfer the coulomb interaction has a greater influence during the laser pulse .",
    "a good agreement between first order and ctmc results was found at high laser field intensities , where the momentum was high , while at lower intensities with low momentum the agreement was acceptable , comparable with the agreement between the cv and ctmc results .",
    "our model can be further improved by considering the influence of the coulomb potential on the final state wavefunction , by using coulomb wavefunctions instead of simple plane waves for the final state , which will be the subject of our future investigations .",
