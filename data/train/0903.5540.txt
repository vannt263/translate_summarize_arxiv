    "<S> we use the qcd sum rules to evaluate the mass of a possible scalar mesonic state that couples to a molecular @xmath0 current . </S>",
    "<S> we find a mass @xmath1 gev , which is in a excellent agreement with the recently observed @xmath2 charmonium state . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight , we work at leading order in @xmath3 and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass @xmath4 . we also consider a molecular @xmath5 current and we obtain @xmath6 , around 200 mev above the mass of the @xmath7 charmonium state . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that it is possible to describe the @xmath2 structure as a @xmath8 molecular state .    </S>",
    "<S> there is growing evidence that at least some of the new charmonium states recently discovery in the b - factories are non conventional @xmath9 states . some possible interpretations for these states </S>",
    "<S> are mesonic molecules , tetraquarks , or / and hybrid mesons . </S>",
    "<S> some of these new mesons have their masses very close to the meson - meson threshold like the @xmath10 @xcite and the @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a molecular interpretation for these states seems natural . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent aquisiton for this list of peculiar states is the narrow structure observed by the cdf collaboration in the decay @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and width of this structure is @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath2 decays into two @xmath15 vector mesons , it has positive @xmath16 and @xmath17 parities .    </S>",
    "<S> there are already some theoretical interpretations for this structure . </S>",
    "<S> its interpretation as a conventional @xmath9 state is complicated because , as pointed out by the cdf collaboration @xcite , it lies well above the threshold for open charm decays and , therefore , a @xmath9 state with this mass would decay predominantly into an open charm pair with a large total width . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the authors interpreted the @xmath2 as the molecular partner of the charmonium - like state @xmath7 , which was observed by belle and babar collaborations near the @xmath18 threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they concluded that the @xmath2 is probably a @xmath19 molecular state with @xmath20 or @xmath21 . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite they have interpreted the @xmath2 as an exotic hybrid charmonium with @xmath22 .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we use the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite , to study the two - point function based on a @xmath8 current with @xmath20 , to see if the new observed resonance structure , @xmath2 , can be interpreted as such molecular state . in previous calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the hidden charm mesons @xmath23 and @xmath24 have been studied using the qcdsr approach as tetraquark or molecular states @xcite . in some cases a very good agreement with the experimental mass was obtained .    the starting point for constructing a qcd sum rule to evaluate the mass of a hadronic state , @xmath25 , </S>",
    "<S> is the correlator function ( q)=id^4x  e^iq.x0 |t[j_h(x)j_h^(0)]|0 , where the current @xmath26 creates the states with the quantum numbers of the hadron @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> a possible current describing a @xmath27 molecular state with @xmath28 is j=(|s_a_c_a)(|c_b^s_b ) , [ field ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are color indices .    </S>",
    "<S> the qcd sum rule is obtained by evaluating the correlation function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) in two ways : in the ope side , we calculate the correlation function at the quark level in terms of quark and gluon fields . </S>",
    "<S> we work at leading order in @xmath3 in the operators , we consider the contributions from condensates up to dimension eight and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass @xmath4 . in the phenomenological side , the correlation function is calculated by inserting intermediate states for the @xmath27 molecular scalar state . parametrizing the coupling of the scalar state , @xmath31 , to the current , @xmath32 , in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field ] ) in terms of the parameter @xmath33 : [ eq : decay ] 0 | j|h=. [ lam ] the phenomenological side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) can be written as ^phen(q^2)=^2m_h^2-q^2+_0^ds ^cont(s)s - q^2 , where the second term in the rhs of eq.([phe ] ) denotes higher scalar resonance contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to notice that there is no one to one correspondence between the current and the state , since the current in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field ] ) can be rewritten in terms of sum a over tetraquark type currents , by the use of the fierz transformation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the parameter @xmath33 , appearing in eq .  ( [ lam ] ) , gives a measure of the strength of the coupling between the current and the state .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function in the ope side can be written as a dispersion relation : ^ope(q^2)=_4m_c^2^ds </S>",

    "<S> , it is assumed that the continuum contribution to the spectral density , @xmath36 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phe ] ) , vanishes bellow a certain continuum threshold @xmath37 . above this threshold , it is given by the result obtained with the ope . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one uses the ansatz @xcite ^cont(s)=^ope(s)(s - s_0 ) ,    to improve the matching between the two sides of the sum rule , we perfom a borel transform . after transferring the continuum contribution to the ope side , the sum rules for the scalar meson , considered as a scalar @xmath38 molecule , up to dimension - eight condensates , using factorization hypothesis , can be written as : ^2e^-^2/m^2=_4m_c^2^s_0ds   e^-s / m^2  ^ope(s ) , [ sr1 ] where ^ope(s)=^pert(s)+^(s ) + ^g^2(s)+^mix(s)+^^2(s)+^mix(s ) , with [ eq : pert ] & & ^pert(s)=32 ^ 9 ^6_^ d^3 _ ^1-d^2(1 - - ) ^3(-4m_cm_s ) , + & & ^(s)=32 ^ 5 ^ 4_^ d\\{m_s(m_c^2-(1-)s)^21 - - m_c_^1-d . </S>",

    "<S> we have neglected the contribution of the dimension - six condensate @xmath43 , since it is assumed to be suppressed by the loop factor @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we also include a part of the dimension-8 condensate contributions , related with the mixed condensate - quark condensate contribution : ^mix(s)&=&-m_cm_0 ^ 2 ^ 216 ^ 2_0 ^ 1 d  ( s - m_c^2(1- ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ dim8 ] it is important to point out that a complete evaluation of the dimension-8 condensate , and higher dimension condensates contributions , require more involved analysis @xcite , which is beyond the scope of this calculation .    to extract the mass @xmath45 we take the derivative of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr ] ) with respect to @xmath46 , and divide the result by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr ] ) .    for a consistent comparison with the results obtained for the other molecular states using the qcdsr approach , we have considered here the same values used for the quark masses and condensates as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the borel window is determined by analysing the ope convergence and the pole contribution . to determine the minimum value of the borel mass we impose that the contribution of the dimension-8 condensate should be smaller than 20% of the total contribution .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconv ] we show the contribution of all the terms in the ope side of the sum rule . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that for @xmath54 gev@xmath55 the contribution of the dimension-8 condensate is less than 20% of the total contribution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we fix the lower value of @xmath56 in the sum rule window as @xmath57 gev@xmath55 .    the maximum value of the borel mass is determined by imposing that the pole contribution must be bigger than the continuum contribution . in table </S>",
    "<S> i we show the values of @xmath58 . in our numerical analysis , we will consider the range of @xmath56 values from 2.3 @xmath59 until the one allowed by the pole dominance criterion given in table i.     +    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     taking into account the incertainties given above we finally arrive at = ( 4.140.09 )  , [ ymass ] in an excellent agreement with the mass of the narrow structure @xmath2 observed by cdf .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also deduce , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr1 ] ) , the parameter @xmath33 defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lam ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we get : = ( 4.220.83 ) 10 ^ -2  ^5 , [ la1 ]    from the above study it is very easy to get results for the @xmath60 molecular state with @xmath20 . for this </S>",
    "<S> we only have to take @xmath61 and @xmath62 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dim6 ] ) , ( [ dim8 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this study was already done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite considering @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> although in the case of the @xmath64 scalar molecule we get a worse borel convergence than for the @xmath38 scalar molecule , as can be seen by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ opedd ] , there is still a good ope convergence for @xmath65 .    if we allow also for the @xmath60 molecule values of the continuum threshold in the range @xmath66 we get @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , from a qcd sum rule study , the difference between the masses of the states that couple with scalar @xmath8 and @xmath60 currents , is consistent with zero . the mass obtained with the @xmath60 scalar current is about 100 mev above the @xmath68 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this could be an indication that there is a repulsive interaction between the two @xmath69 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> strong interactions effects might lead to repulsive interactions that could result in a virtual state above the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this structure may or may not indicate a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering the errors , it is not compatible with the observed @xmath70 charmonium - like state .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dif ] we show the relative ratio @xmath71 as a function of the borel mass for @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> from this figure we can see that the ratio is very stable as a function of @xmath56 and the difference between the masses is smaller than 0.5% . </S>",
    "<S> although the ratio is shown for @xmath72 , the result is indiscernible from the one shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dif ] for other values of the continuum threshold in the range @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> this result for the mass difference is completely unexpected since , in general , each strange quark adds approximately 100 mev to the mass of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one would naively expect that the mass of the @xmath38 state should be around 200 mev heavier than the mass of the @xmath64 state . </S>",
    "<S> this was , for instance , the result obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the vector molecular states @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where the masses obtained were : @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    for the value of the parameter @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> we get : _ d^*d^ * = ( 4.200.96)10 ^ -2  ^5 . [ la2 ] therefore , comparing the results in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ la1 ] ) and ( [ la2 ] ) we conclude that the currents couple with similar strength to the corresponding states , and that both , @xmath8 and @xmath60 scalar molecular states have masses compatible with the recently observed @xmath2 narrow structure . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the @xmath2 was observed in the decay @xmath78 , the @xmath8 assignment is more compatible with its quark content .    in conclusion , we have presented a qcdsr analysis of the two - point function for possible @xmath8 and @xmath60 molecular states with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that the @xmath2 narrow structure observed by the cdf collaboration in the decay @xmath12 can be very well described by using a scalar @xmath8 current . although the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite interpreted the @xmath2 as a @xmath27 molecular scalar state and the @xmath7 as a @xmath5 molecular scalar state , we have obtained similar masses for the states that couple with the scalars @xmath27 and @xmath5 currents . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , from a qcd sum rule point of view , the charmonium - like state @xmath7 , observed by belle and babar collaborations , has a mass around 200 mev smaller than the state that couples with a @xmath5 scalar current and , therefore , can not be well described by such a current .    </S>",
    "<S> while this work has been finalized , a similar calculation was presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the author of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite arrived to a different conclusion . </S>"
