    "quark masses are fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) and thus it is desirable to determine their numerical values with the highest possible precision . in order to do so",
    "it is necessary to fix a renormalization scheme which defines the quark mass .",
    "a renormalization scheme which is of particular importance in those situations where the quark mass is small as compared to the typical energy scale is the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "although it has no immediate physical interpretation , in general a good convergence in perturbation theory is observed . on the other hand ,",
    "the most intuitive renormalization scheme is the on - shell scheme where the renormalized quark mass is defined as the pole of the propagator .",
    "it is well known that such a definition is plagued by numerically large long - distance effects which are connected to the renormalon corrections . as",
    "a consequence one observes a bad behaviour of the perturbative expansion if the pole mass is used as a parameter .",
    "still , it plays a crucial role in all computations of threshold phenomena like energy levels or the decay of a quark - anti - quark bound state . in order to make contact between high - energy phenomena on one side and threshold processes on the other side",
    "it is necessary to have a precise relation between the pole and the @xmath0 quark mass at hand .",
    "important three - loop contributions are provided in this paper . as a by - product",
    "we also compute the same kind of corrections to the wave function renormalization constant .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the relation between the @xmath0 and on - shell mass have been computed almost 30 years ago in ref .",
    "about ten years later , the two - loop corrections have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . shortly afterwards also",
    "the two - loop result for the on - shell wave function renormalization constant @xmath1 has been obtained  @xcite .",
    "contributions with a single mass scale were expressed via master integrals exactly in @xmath2 ; the @xmath3-expansion of the only non - trivial master integral is known  @xcite far enough to obtain @xmath4 terms in @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "contributions with two mass scales were obtained up to @xmath6 only .",

    "one of these integrals was later expanded to @xmath9  @xcite ( though only the @xmath10 term is published ) .",
    "both integrals were calculated  @xcite up to @xmath10 , as series in the mass ratio up to the sixth order . ] the three - loop relation between the @xmath0 and on - shell mass has been computed at the end of the nineties in a semi - numerical way in refs .",

    "@xcite using the corresponding corrections to the static potential  @xcite and their cancellation in the relation between the @xmath0 and 1s quark mass .",
    "we concentrate on the situation where the second quark mass is smaller than the external one , although our formulae can also be applied to the reversed situation . then , however , often it is advantageous to perform a decoupling of the heavy mass leading to an effective theory where the latter is integrated out .    as far as the quark masses in the sm",
    "are concerned the corrections considered in this paper are of practical relevance for the bottom quark where the second mass scale is given by the charm quark .",

    "thus the massless approximation does not provide a good result . in all other cases the effect from a lighter quark mass is negligible .",
    "nevertheless , below generic results are presented .    in principle at three - loop order there is also a contribution involving two additional masses which are present in two closed fermion loops . however , for all practical applications the lightest quark mass can safely be neglected .",
