    "effective nondestructive testing ( ndt ) can prevent disasters similar to the buncefield incident @xcite , resulting in an estimated loss of  894 million . a great number of ndt methods have been developed .",
    "these include : visual , radiographic , ultrasonic , eddy current , thermal infrared , acoustic emission , and magnetic particle testing , _",
    "etc._. in this paper , we focus on the magnetic flux leakage ( mfl ) method , which originates from the magnetic particle technique .",
    "the principle of the mfl method can be understood as follows : when a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material , the leakage of the magnetic field which is caused by the discontinuity of the geometry can be captured by the sensors , such as hall probe _ etc._.",
    "the main reason for the leakage is due to the difference , @xmath2(10 ) , of the magnetic permeability of the mediums at the interface @xcite .",
    "the first application of mfl can be dated back to 1868 , the british navy used a compass to examine a magnetised cannon to search for defects @xcite .",
    "this technique was extensively applied due to the development of magnetisation techniques for examining defects in pipelines , pressure vessels , and wheels , @xmath3 in the 1960s .",
    "the defect characteristics , such as shapes , dimensions and locations , can be determined by the leakage signals and a large amount of relevant numerical and experimental research has been carried out . practically , the nature of such ndt problems is transient rather than static and simply using the results obtained from static simulations to predict transient problems may cause errors , especially under the condition of high velocity .",

    "the distortion of the magnetic field points in the specimen movement direction and is independent to the orientation of the magnetizing source .",
    "this signal deformation can influence the efficiency of the ndt , especially for determining the defect location . with the aim of compensating for this leakage signal deformation",
    ", a scheme was validated against experimental results @xcite .",
