    "for many time series , in particular for economic data , the question whether the series is stationary or becomes stationary when taking first order differences is a delicate problem .",
    "fixed - sample tests have been extensively studied in the statistics and econometrics literature and this topic is still an active area of research .",
    "most proposed unit root tests are parametric approaches based on the least squares estimator in an ar model . under the random walk hypothesis non - standard limiting distributions appear .",
    "classic and more recent references are dickey and fuller ( 1979 ) , rao ( 1978 , 1980 ) , evans and savin ( 1981 ) , chan and wei ( 1987 , 1988 ) , and phillips and perron ( 1988 ) , stock ( 1994a ) , saikkonen and ltkepohl ( 2003 ) , and lanne and saikkonen ( 2003 ) .",

    "the kpss test , proposed in the first paper and also studied in detail in the latter two articles , avoids a detailed specification of the process .",
    "it can be easily used for testing both the null hypothesis of stationarity against the unit root alternative , and vice versa , and , as shown by simulations , is considerably more robust in terms of type i error than most parametrically motivated tests .",
    "thus we use that statistic as a starting point to develop detection procedures which can be used to detect a change from @xmath0 ( covering stationarity ) to @xmath3 ( covering random walks ) , and vice versa .",
    "similar detection procedures related to the dickey - fuller statistic , which is often more powerful but can be affected by severe size distortion , will be studied by the author in a separate paper in detail ( steland , 2006 ) .    as an example of a simple change - point model ( regime switching model ) capturing this feature consider @xmath4 with mean - zero error terms @xmath5 and a change - point parameter @xmath6 . until the change the _ in - control model _ of a @xmath2 process holds .",
    "this model is a special case of a @xmath7-to-@xmath0 change - point model studied in this article . if @xmath8 $ ] lai and siegmund ( 1983 ) studied fixed accuracy estimation of an ar parameter assuming i.i.d .",
    "error terms by sampling until the fisher information exceeds a constant . allowing for dependent errors ,",
    "we consider a different setup and study truncated stopping times of the type @xmath9 for some _ control statistic _ , @xmath10 , and a _ control limit _ ( critical value ) @xmath11 , where monitoring stops latest at the @xmath12th observation .",
    "that maximum sample size , @xmath13 , plays the role of a time horizon where a decision is made in any case ; if no signal is given , the in - control model ( null hypothesis ) is accepted as a plausible model , otherwise one stops concluding that a change occurred and further measures may be in order .",
    "we stop latest at @xmath13 , since often the assumption implicit to many classic monitoring procedures with random sample size , namely that a process can and should be monitored forever , is unrealistic , and approaches allowing to specify a time horizon may be more appropriate in many cases .",
    "for example , consider financial portfolios .",
    "continuous or pseudo - continuous ( daily ) trading is often not feasible , due to cost constraints and because identification of mid- and long - term investment chances requires time- and cost - intensive analyses on a quarterly to yearly basis . between these analyses",
    "one should apply monitoring rules with time horizon to trigger additional updates , risk hedges , or other measures . having approximations to the distributions of the control statistic and the monitoring rule ( stopping time ) for large @xmath13 are therefore of interest , thus motivating to assume @xmath14 for asymptotic studies .    to allow the design of procedures satisfying arbitrary constraints , e.g. prespecified type i error , average run length ( arl ) or median run length ,",
    "we establish the limiting laws which are functionals of brownian motion or the ornstein - uhlenbeck process . besides the important change - point models mentioned above , we consider pure random walks , stationary processes , local trend - stationary processes , and the local - to - unity model , where a sequence of models is considered which converges to a random walk , as the maximum sample size , @xmath13 , tends to @xmath15 .",
