    "wormholes are hypothetical objects which connect two distant parts of the same spacetime or two different spacetimes by a throat - like object which has the minimum radius of the spacetime .",
    "although a wormhole solution first entered the physics literature in 1916 @xcite , the concept was first considered seriously in 1935 by einstein and rosen @xcite which was later called einstein - rosen bridge but the word wormhole was first time coined by wheeler @xcite in 1957 .",
    "a more interesting analysis of wormholes was performed by morris and thorne in 1988 and they presented a new kind of wormhole ( traversable wormhole ) for the first time @xcite .",
    "it was known from before that matter we need to support such a geometry violates the weak and strong energy conditions near the throat @xcite .",
    "morris and thorne reconsidered these conditions for a traversable wormhole @xcite . since the matter that supports this geometry does nt satisfy the common energy conditions they called it exotic. an example of exotic matter is matter with negative energy density @xcite .",
    "another property of these wormholes is the possibility of transforming them into time machines for backward time traveling @xcite and thereby , perhaps for causality violation by closed timelike curves .",
    "teo @xcite found that the null energy condition ( @xmath1 ) is violated by stationary , axially symmetric , traversable wormholes but there can be classes of geodesics which do not cross energy condition violating regions . another case of evolving wormholes may alter this situation@xcite .",
    "it is known that we can have violations of weak energy condition ( @xmath2 ) due to some quantum mechanical effects ( such as casimir effect ) @xcite .",
    "if we search for this effect in the history of evolving cosmos , we can find such a situation at the quantum cosmological era when quantum gravity is dominant .",
    "following the inflation theory by a. guth @xcite it has been supposed that non - trivial topological objects such as microscopic wormholes may have been formed during that era and then enlarged to macroscopic objects with expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "although most studies have focused on four dimensions , with the advent of string theory that demands higher dimensional spacetimes , it is natural to examine the possibility of wormholes beyond the ordinary four dimensions .",
    "euclidean wormholes in string theory have recently been studied @xcite as solutions of supergravities . with this motivation",
    ", we are going to choose the generalized friedmann - robertson - walker ( @xmath3 ) metric in @xmath0-dimensions and investigate exact lorentzian wormhole geometries with spherically symmetry .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in sec .",
    "[ field ] we present the ansatz metric and the resulting solutions in 4-dimensions . in section [ ndim ] ,",
    "we extend the solutions to ( n+1)-dimensions . in section [ energy ]",
    ", we investigate the corresponding energy - momentum tensor and determine the exoticity parameter .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and closing remarks .",
    "it is very common today that we start studying cosmology with the so - called cosmological principle. it states that the universe at large scale is homogeneous and isotropic . with this assumption ,",
    "we find out that the metric we need to demonstrate such a spacetime in 4-dimensions is as follows    @xmath4 , \\label{fe1}\\ ] ]    which is known as the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric @xcite .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath5 used here is the so - called co - moving coordinate system. @xmath6 is the scale factor and the only dynamical parameter to determine . @xmath7 correspond to spatially flat , closed and open spacetimes respectively .",
    "this metric contains a high degree of symmetry which is demonstrated by its six killing vectors .    for our aim",
    ", we need to generalize this metric to @xmath0-dimensions and reduce its symmetry .",
    "we break its homogeneity by replacing @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "this metric is still isotropic about @xmath10 but not necessarily homogeneous .",
    "we therefore write our ansatz metric as @xmath11 ,   \\label{fe2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is an unknown function .",
    "it is clear that the robertson - walker metric is a special case of this metric . with this ansatz metric",
    ", we look at our equations .",
    "we start with @xmath13 and then extend the solutions to arbitrary @xmath14 . in the first step we write our ansatz metric for 5-dimensions ( n=4 )    @xmath15 . \\label{fe201}\\ ] ]    the non - vanishing components of the einstein tensor for our ansatz metric read    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    in which dot is derivative with respect to @xmath20 , while prime is derivative with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "such a geometry is supported by an anisotropic , diagonal energy - momentum tensor :    @xmath22 , \\label{fe7}\\ ] ]    @xmath23 , \\label{fe8}\\ ] ]    @xmath24.\\label{fe9}\\ ] ]    in these relations @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the transverse and radial pressures , respectively .    here , we assume the following equation of state    @xmath27    where @xmath28 depends on @xmath14 the dimension of the space .",
    "this equation reduces to the vacuum equation of state @xmath29 when @xmath30 .    using equations ( [ fe7]-[fe9 ] ) and relation ( [ fe10 ] ) in 5-dimensions ( n=4 )",
    ", we obtain :    @xmath31 + \\\\\\nonumber & & \\frac{1}{1+\\gamma}\\left [ \\left[-3(\\frac{r\\ddot r+\\dot r^2}{r^2})-3\\frac{a}{r^2r^2(1+a)}\\right ] + \\gamma \\left[-3(\\frac{r\\ddot r+\\dot r^2}{r^2})-\\frac{ra^{\\prime}+a(1+a)}{r^2r^2(1+a)^2}\\right]\\right]=0.\\label{fe11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    fortunately , this equation can be separated into radial and temporal equations .",
    "@xmath32    this equation can be easily solved and has the following solutions :    @xmath33    @xmath34    the energy - momentum tensor needed to support this geometry has the following components : @xmath35    @xmath36    and @xmath37",
    "the solutions we obtained in 5-dimensional spacetime can be easily extended to @xmath0-dimensions . the resulting solutions in ( n+1)-dimensions read    @xmath38    @xmath39    following these solutions",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor which supports this structure in ( n+1)-dimensions will be :    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    as a check for the correctness of these solutions one can see that they reduce to the solutions of @xcite for n=3 with proper definition for the integration constants .      now let us have a look at radial behavior of the solutions . in the paper by morris and thorne @xcite ,",
    "the metric of the wormhole is written in the form :    @xmath43    in which @xmath44 is the shape function and the throat radius satisfies @xmath45 .",
    "if the equation @xmath46 has any root @xmath47 and simultaneously @xmath48 for @xmath49 then we will have a wormhole and @xmath47 gives the throat radius of the wormhole . in our solutions , with choosing @xmath50 the condition for the existence of wormholes will be @xmath51 and @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constants related to the integration constants : @xmath55    solving equation ( [ fend7 ] ) analytically is not possible except for special values of n , as presented in @xcite for n=3 .",
    "then for investigating the properties of the solutions , we plot @xmath56 against @xmath21 in figure ( [ i1]-[i2 ] ) .",
    "we classify the solutions in the following manner :    in the case ( a ) , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we see from fig.[i1 ] that we have a lower limit on @xmath21 which corresponds to the throat radius of the wormhole and we see also that there is no upper limit on @xmath21 which reminds us that we have an open spacetime .    for the choice ( b ) , @xmath59 and @xmath58",
    ", we have lower and upper limits on @xmath21 .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to the throat radius of the wormhole and the upper limit signifies a closed spacetime .    in the cases ( a ) and ( b ) , the kretschman scalar blows up at @xmath10 but , this point is not included in our physical spacetime with proper signature .",
    "case ( c ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 represents a naked singularity in a closed cosmological background , because the kretschman scalar blows up at the origin ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "case ( d ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 leads to @xmath64 , which corresponds to the @xmath65 @xmath3 metric .    case ( e ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath9 becomes negative and the metric s signature is not of cosmological interest .    and finally , ( f ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath9 is regular everywhere and represent a naked singularity , again but in an open universe .",
    "we can also have a discussion on the cases which include @xmath70 . for case @xmath71 , from ( [ fend2 ] )",
    "we obtain    @xmath72    this equation with @xmath73 and @xmath58 , leads to a wormhole centered , open universe which is illustrated in fig.[i2 ] part ( g ) .",
    "it is worth having a look at the ricci scalar ( @xmath74 ) . in",
    "( n+1)-dimensional spacetime @xmath74 is :    @xmath75    we can see that choosing @xmath76 or @xmath50 , constant curvature spacetime is retrieved . in the case",
    "@xmath76 , we have a maximally symmetric de sitter spacetime .",
    "we expect this result because , we see that the constant part of the ricci scalar reminds us a maximally symmetric spacetime curvature .    the wormholes discussed in this paper are traversable .",
    "we present two reasons here .",
    "the first reasoning is based on the redshift of a signal emitted at the comoving coordinate @xmath77 and received by a distant observer . using the metric ( [ fe201 ] ) and for a radial beam ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath78    using this relation for two signals separated by @xmath79 in time when emitted ( and @xmath80 when detected ) , we obtain    @xmath81    in which @xmath82 is the scale factor at the time of observation , and @xmath83 is the scale factor at the time of emission .",
    "this leads to the exactly same relation as the cosmological redshift relation which shows that the wormhole does not introduce extra ( local ) redshift .",
    "light signals , therefore can travel to the both sides of the throat and there is no horizon .",
    "the second is based on the geodesic equation , which -for the metric ( [ fe201])- leads to @xmath84 and @xmath85 in which @xmath86 is an affine parameter along the geodesic .",
    "the first equation has the following first integral    @xmath87    since the proper distant element is @xmath88 , we see that there is no radial turning point and any particle can move in either radial directions at any point near to the wormhole , which clearly shows that the wormhole is traversable .",
    "let us have a brief discussion on the observational consequences of these solutions .",
    "we can have a variety of geodesics in a wormhole spacetime @xcite .",
    "geodesics can pass through the throat right to the other part of the spacetime ( the parallel universe ) , or be deflected back to the same universe . as pointed out by cramer et .",
    "@xcite , it should be possible -in principle- to detect wormholes via the gravitational lensing they cause .",
    "this , however , depends on the wormhole being stable , which is not addressed in the present paper .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional version of diagonal elements of the energy- momentum tensor are were given in equations ( [ fend3]-[fend5 ] ) .",
    "some points are interesting to mention about the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "since we are looking for spherical structures in a cosmological background , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath89 should become almost @xmath21-independent at large @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , for suitable values of @xmath28 , the solutions approach @xmath90 which correspond to dark energy ( cosmological constant ) .",
    "the second point is the conservation equation of the energy - momentum tensor :    @xmath91    which leads to @xmath92 our solutions satisfy this equation , as expected .",
    "let us now investigate the exoticity parameter . for an isotropic fluid ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is in the form @xmath93 and the exoticity parameter is defined according to    @xmath94    where @xmath95 corresponds to the exotic matter and @xmath96 to the non - exotic matter . since we have an anisotropic medium , the energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath97 .",
    "we therefore take the average pressure @xmath98    taking this into account , we adopt the following , more general definition for @xmath99 : @xmath100    and modify ( [ e7 ] ) according to    @xmath101    from ( [ fe10 ] ) we see that the modified exoticity parameter is everywhere zero and for all cases , which shows that we are on the border line between exotic and non - exotic matter according to the criterion",
    ". the weak energy condition @xmath102 requires    @xmath103    for every nonspacelike @xmath104 which leads to @xcite    @xmath105    these equations and relations ( [ fend3]-[fend5 ] ) lead to    @xmath106    @xmath107    @xmath108    these relations show that , with the choice @xmath109 , we ca nt have any wormhole without violating @xmath2 , or at least the border line at which we have the equality relation in ( [ e13 ] ) and ( [ e14 ] ) . in the case @xmath110 the relations ( [ e13 ] ) and ( [ e14 ] ) are both simultaneously satisfied and we have to investigate the relation ( [ e12 ] ) in order to see wether @xmath2 is satisfied .",
    "it is interesting to note that for particular ranges of constants we have wormhole solutions which satisfy @xmath2 throughout the spacetime . as an example of these solutions",
    "one can see case ( g ) in fig.[i2 ] .",
    "we introduced time - dependent wormholes in an @xmath0-dimensional expanding cosmological background .",
    "we presented an ansatz metric and a linear relation between the diagonal elements of the energy - momentum tensor . with these assumptions , we separated and solved the field equations .",
    "solutions were classified into different categories with distinct geometries for the central object .",
    "we distinguished two classes of solutions which represented lorentzian wormholes with expanding throat in closed and open universes .",
    "we also found two classes of solutions that contain an intrinsic singularity in open and closed universes .",
    "the other interesting solution was the familiar maximally symmetric de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the ricci scalar was calculated and the constant curvature class of solutions were discussed .",
    "the issue of the traversability of the wormhole solutions was considerd .",
    "we investigated the energy - momentum tensor required to support these solutions .",
    "our solutions led to an energy - momentum tensor which approaches the cosmological constant case far from the wormhole for @xmath111 .",
    "finally , we investigated the exoticity parameter .",
    "the exoticity parameter for the linear equation of state is zero everywhere which is border line between exotic and non - exotic matter .",
    "we also checked the weak energy condition and found that the weak energy condition in the choice @xmath112 is violated except for the border line case .",
    "for the case @xmath70 , @xmath2 is satisfied for suitable values of constants ."
