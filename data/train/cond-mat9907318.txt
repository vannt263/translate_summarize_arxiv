    "this absence of a metallic state in @xmath1 is nowadays challenged since a lot of transport measurements , following the pioneering experiments of kravchenko and co - workers @xcite , give evidence of an insulator - metal transition ( imt ) when the carrier density is increased .",
    "many experimental results suggest that coulomb repulsion drives this phenomenon : ( 1 ) in a very clean heterostructure the imt was observed at a coulomb energy to fermi energy ratio @xmath2 @xcite , close to @xmath3 for which a clean wigner crystal melts according to monte carlo simulations @xcite ; ( 2 ) in more disordered samples , the imt typically occurs at @xmath4 , again compatible with the value expected for the melting of a pinned wigner crystal @xcite ; ( 3 ) at a weaker @xmath0 interactions no longer dominate and a re - entry towards an insulating phase ( fermi glass of weakly interacting localized particles ) was observed at @xmath5 in @xcite . as at the imt @xmath6 ( @xmath7 denoting the fermi wave vector and @xmath8 the elastic mean free path ) , disorder is important and has to be considered , together with interactions , in a non perturbative way .",

    "the hamiltonian reads : @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron in the site @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the strength of the hopping terms between nearest neighbours ( @xmath16 in the following ) and @xmath17 the inter - particle distance for a @xmath1 torus .",
    "the random potential @xmath18 of the site @xmath19 with occupation number @xmath20 is taken from a box distribution of width @xmath21 . the interaction strength @xmath22 yields @xmath23 for a filling factor @xmath24 .",

    "this behaviour is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) : the ground state local current angles @xmath51 undergo a transition from a nearly uniform angular distribution ( glass of currents randomly directed in the plane ) towards a distribution strongly peaked in the longitudinal direction . as a consequence , the sign of the magnetic response becomes independent of the microscopic realization of the random potential ( see fig .",
