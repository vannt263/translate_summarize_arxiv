    "strongly correlated electron systems have been studied intensively in relation to high - temperature superconductivity ( sc ) .",
    "high - temperature superconductors@xcite are known as a typical correlated electron system .",
    "recently , the mechanism of superconductivity in high - temperature superconductors has been extensively studied using various two - dimensional ( 2d ) models of electronic interactions . among them",
    "the 2d hubbard model@xcite is the simplest and most fundamental model .",
    "this model has been studied intensively using numerical tools , such as the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method @xcite , and the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method@xcite .",
    "the quantum monte carlo method is a numerical method employed to simulate the behavior of correlated electron systems .",
    "it is well known , however , that there are significant issues associated with the application of the qmc method .",
    "the most important one is that the standard metropolis ( or heat bath ) algorithm is associated with the negative sign problem . in past studies",
    "workers have investigated the possibility of eliminating the negative sign problem@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we adopt an optimization scheme which is based on diagonalization quantum monte carlo ( qmd ) method@xcite ( a bosonic version was developed in ref.@xcite ) , as well as the metropolis quantum monte carlo method ( called the metropolis qmc in this paper ) .",
    "in general , and as in this study , the ground - state wave function is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian and @xmath8 is the initial one - particle state such as the fermi sea . in the qmd method",
    "this wave function is written as a linear combination of the basis states , generated using the auxiliary field method based on the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ; that is @xmath9 where @xmath10 are basis functions . in this work",
    "we have assumed a subspace with @xmath11 basis wave functions . from the variational principle ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath12 are determined from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian , to obtain the lowest energy state in the selected subspace @xmath13 . once the @xmath14 coefficients are determined , the ground - state energy and other quantities are calculated using this wave function .",
    "if the expectation values are not highly sensitive to the number of basis states , we can obtain the correct expectation values using an extrapolation in terms of the basis states in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "whether the 2d hubbard model can account for high - temperature superconductivity is an important question in the study of high - temperature superconductors . in correlated electron systems",
    ", there is an interesting phenomenological correlation between the maximum @xmath16 and the transfer integral @xmath17 : @xmath18 @xmath19 indicates the mass enhancement factor and @xmath20 is the effective transfer integral . by adopting @xmath21ev@xcite and @xmath22",
    ", this formula applies to high-@xmath16 cuprates with @xmath23k .",
    "as the electron becomes heavier , @xmath16 is lowered ( in accordance with the lowering of @xmath16 in the underdoped region ) .",
    "we can choose @xmath24ev and @xmath25 for iron pnictides to give @xmath26k .",
    "this formula strongly suggests that high - temperature superconductivity originates from the electron correlation , not from the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "most of qmc method results do not support superconductivity , although the results of vmc method with the gutzwiller ansatz indicates the stable d - wave pairing state for large @xmath0 .",
    "the computations of the pair - field susceptibility suggest the existence of the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the 2d hubbard model indicating superconducting transition in real 3d systems@xcite .",
    "the perturbative and random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations also support superconductivity with anisotropic pairing symmetry@xcite . in contrast , the pair correlation functions obtained by a qmc method@xcite are extremely suppressed for the intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "this result suggests that superconductivity is impossible in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "the objective of this paper is to compute pair correlation functions and clarify this discrepancy using a new qmc method with employing the diagonalization scheme@xcite .",
    "we show that the pair correlation function is indeed enhanced at doping .",
    "the hamiltonian is the hubbard model containing on - site coulomb repulsion and is written as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath30 at the @xmath31-th site and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the transfer energy between the sites @xmath34 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath35 for the nearest - neighbor bonds and @xmath36 for the next nearest - neighbor bonds . for all other cases",
    "@xmath0 is the on - site coulomb energy .",
    "the number of sites is @xmath38 and the linear dimension of the system is denoted as @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 . the energy unit is given by @xmath17 and the number of electrons is denoted as @xmath41 .",
    "in a quantum monte carlo simulation , the ground state wave function is @xmath42 where @xmath8 is the initial one - particle state represented by a slater determinant . for large @xmath43 , @xmath44 will project out the ground state from @xmath8 .",
    "we write the hamiltonian as @xmath45 where k and v are the kinetic and interaction terms of the hamiltonian in eq.([hamil ] ) , respectively . the wave function in eq.([psi ] )",
    "is written as @xmath46 for @xmath47 . using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation@xcite",
    ", we have @xmath48 for @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "the wave function is expressed as a summation of the one - particle slater determinants over all the configurations of the auxiliary fields @xmath51 .",
    "the exponential operator is expressed as@xcite @xmath52 where we have defined @xmath53 for @xmath54 @xmath55 the ground - state wave function is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a slater determinant corresponding to a configuration @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) of the auxiliary fields : @xmath60 the coefficients @xmath61 are constant real numbers : @xmath62 .",
    "the initial state @xmath8 is a one - particle state .",
    "the matrix of @xmath63 is a diagonal matrix given as @xmath64 the matrix elements of @xmath65 are @xmath66 @xmath67 is an @xmath68 matrix given by the product of the matrices @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . the inner product is thereby calculated as a determinant@xcite , @xmath72 the expectation value of the quantity @xmath73 is evaluated as @xmath74    @xmath75 can be regarded as the weighting factor to obtain the monte carlo samples .",
    "since this quantity is not necessarily positive definite , the weighting factor should be @xmath76 ; the resulting relationship is , @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 this relation can be evaluated using a monte carlo procedure if an appropriate algorithm , such as the metropolis or heat bath method , is employed@xcite .",
    "the summation can be evaluated using appropriately defined monte carlo samples , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of samples .",
    "the sign problem is an issue if the summation of @xmath82 vanishes within statistical errors . in this case",
    "it is indeed impossible to obtain definite expectation values .",
    "quantum monte carlo diagonalization ( qmd ) is a method for the evaluation of @xmath83 without _ the negative sign problem_. the configuration space of the probability @xmath84 in eq.([qqmc ] ) is generally very strongly peaked .",
    "the sign problem lies in the distribution of @xmath85 in the configuration space .",
    "it is important to note that the distribution of the basis functions @xmath10 ( @xmath86 ) is uniform since @xmath14 are constant numbers : @xmath62 . in the subspace @xmath13 , selected from all configurations of auxiliary fields , the right - hand side of eq.([qexpe ] ) can be determined .",
    "however , the large number of basis states required to obtain accurate expectation values is beyond the current storage capacity of computers .",
    "thus we use the variational principle to obtain the expectation values .    from the variational principle , @xmath87 where @xmath14 ( @xmath86 ) are variational parameters . in order to minimize the",
    "energy @xmath88 the equation @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) is solved for , @xmath91 if we set @xmath92 @xmath93 the eigen equation is @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath10 ( @xmath86 ) are not necessarily orthogonal , @xmath96 is not a diagonal matrix .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath97 , and then calculate the expectation values of correlation functions with the ground state eigenvector ; in general @xmath97 is not a symmetric matrix .    in order to optimize the wave function",
    "we must increase the number of basis states @xmath13 .",
    "this can be simply accomplished through random sampling . for systems of small sizes and small @xmath0",
    ", we can evaluate the expectation values from an extrapolation of the basis of randomly generated states .",
    "the number of basis states is about 2000 when the system size is small . for systems @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the number of states in increased up to about 10000 .    in quantum monte carlo simulations an extrapolation",
    "is performed to obtain the expectation values for the ground - state wave function .",

    "<S> in this study we have computed the pair correlation functions in the two - dimensional hubbard model using a quantum monte carlo method . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a new diagonalization algorithm in quantum monte carlo method which is free from the negative sign problem . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the d - wave pairing correlation function is indeed enhanced slightly for the positive on - site coulomb interaction @xmath0 when doping away from the half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> when the system size becomes large , the pair correlation function @xmath1 is increased for @xmath2 compared to the non - interacting case , while @xmath1 is suppressed for @xmath2 when the system size is small . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement ratio @xmath3/p_d[u=0]$ ] will give a criterion on the existence of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath3/p_d[u=0]$ ] increases almost linearly @xmath4 as the system size @xmath5 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> this increase is a good indication of an existence of superconducting phase in the two - dimensional hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , no enhancement of pair correlation functions at half - filling , which indicates the absence of superconductivity without hole doping . </S>"
