    "considerable amount of attention in the recent literature has been devoted to studying the relation between stellar mass ( @xmath1 ) , star formation rate ( sfr ) and gas - phase metallicity ( @xmath0 ) in galaxies . the @xmath1-sfr-@xmath0 relation is believed to be a stronger diagnostic of galactic chemical evolution than the simpler @xmath1-@xmath0 relation , as it provides constraints on the recent star formation , as well as the integrated star formation ( i.e. @xmath1 ) and current @xmath0 . however , despite this , there remain a number of possible explanations for the trends seen in this relation in the local universe .",
    "@xcite found an anti - correlation between @xmath0 and both specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) and half - light radius at low @xmath1 .",
    "this dependence was attributed to lower present - day star formation efficiencies in more compact galaxies , as rapid star formation at early times is believed to consume most of the cold gas in these systems . a flat fundamental plane relating @xmath1 , sfr and @xmath0",
    "was later found by @xcite , which extends unchanged out to @xmath6 . at the same time , a three - dimensional fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) was found by @xcite .",
    "the fmr corrects for the observed anti - correlation between sfr and @xmath0 at low @xmath1 to provide a prediction of the metallicity of local galaxies with an expected 1@xmath7 scatter of only @xmath8 dex . the sfr-@xmath0 dependence at low mass was assumed to be due to highly star - forming galaxies driving stronger galactic winds , which can efficiently remove metals from their small gravitational potential wells .",
    "a study of sdss - dr7 galaxies by @xcite ( 2012 , hereafter ykg12 ) also found an anti - correlation between sfr and @xmath0 at low mass , but additionally a _ positive _ correlation between these two properties at high mass .",
    "the key difference between the @xcite and ykg12 studies was the metallicity diagnostic used ",
    "the former took the average metallicity obtained from the @xmath9 ( i.e. [ oii]+[oiii]/h@xmath10 ) and [ nii]/h@xmath11 ratios , whereas the latter took the bayesian metallicities provided by the mpa - jhu catalogue , which are based on fitting six strong emission line fluxes to synthetic spectra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ykg12 argued that their choice of metallicity diagnostic is likely to be more robust for local , high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "this is because , a ) the [ nii]/h@xmath11 diagnostic is prone to _ under_-estimating the metallicity in this regime , due to saturation as the electron temperature drops below that required to easily excite the [ nii]@xmath126584 line .",
    "and b ) the @xmath9 diagnostic , as calibrated by @xcite , seems to _ over_-estimate the metallicity in this regime compared to the bayesian technique by up to @xmath13 dex , especially for lower - sfr galaxies .",
    "some recent observational studies support the findings of ykg12 .",
    "for example , lara - lpez et al .",
    "( 2012 , in prep . ) found a positive correlation between sfr and @xmath0 at high mass when using either a [ nii]/[oii ] or ( [ oiii]/h@xmath10)/([nii]/h@xmath11 ) diagnostic , demonstrating that it is not just bayesian metallicities that produce such a trend .",
    "similarly , @xcite have found a slight positive correlation at high mass when using a @xmath9 or [ nii]/h@xmath11 diagnostic ( separately ) .",
    "however , such a correlation is less clear when using the @xmath14 method , as their sample has only very few galaxies above @xmath15 ( see their figure 11 ) . additionally , metallicities derived using the @xmath14 method can be unreliable above @xmath16 due to local and global temperature gradients across galaxies ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have found a correlation between sfr and dust extinction very similar to that found between sfr and @xmath0 by ykg12 . as dust and metals",
    "are known to be produced and distributed in similar ways throughout galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , these two correlations could share a common cause .",
    "most recently , kurk et al .",
    "( in prep . ) have found a strong positive correlation between sfr and @xmath0 at high mass in a sample of luci / sins galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "a possible explanation for this positive correlation was provided by ykg12 , using the munich semi - analytic model of galaxy formation , l - galaxies . in the model ,",
    "such a correlation is the consequence of gradual dilution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in low - sfr , massive galaxies by the accretion of metal - poor gas over several gigayears .",
    "secular star formation is shut - down in these systems after a gas - rich merger , which produces a starburst , growth of the central black hole ( bh ) , and ejection of gas via supernova feedback .",
    "thereafter , the remaining gas is of too low density to continue forming stars , and the presence of ` radio mode ' agn feedback suppresses cooling of hot gas from the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) .",
    "however , the accretion of metal - poor , cold gas clumps and low - mass satellites can still proceed ( see  [ sec : dilution in elliptical galaxies ] ) .    there should be a number of signatures at @xmath3 of this specific evolution .",
    "for example , ykg12 noted that they have larger - than - average central black holes for their mass . in this work",
    ", we identify a range of properties at @xmath3 in the model which are indicative of post - merger gradual dilution .",
    "we then utilise a wide array of publicly - available observational data to see if these signatures are also present in real low - sfr , low-@xmath0 galaxies at low redshift .",

    "all of these properties reflect the specific evolution that these galaxies have undergone  a gradual dilution of the ism after a merger - induced starburst that expelled gas via sn feedback and grew the central bh .",
    "secular star formation and subsequent metal enrichment could not be resumed thereafter due to a ) the small amount of remaining cold gas having a density below the threshold required for star formation , and b ) the suppression of further cooling by agn feedback .    in the case of @xmath33 ( panel c )",
    ", it is more precise to say that enriching galaxies form a tight distribution around @xmath38 , whereas diluting galaxies exhibit a strong tail down to low ( even negative ) values .",
    "this parameter is a useful diagnostic for dilution of the ism _",
    "after _ the last bout of star formation , as low values of @xmath33 indicate a decrease in the gas - phase metallicity without a corresponding decrease in the stellar metallicity @xcite .",
    "enriching galaxies are undergoing smooth , continuous star formation , and so have reached an equilibrium between their gas and stellar metallicities , whereas diluting galaxies are experiencing gradual dilution of the ism at a greater rate than any star formation .",
    "we should therefore expect that the value of @xmath33 in diluting galaxies anti - correlates with the time spent undergoing dilution .",
    "[ fig : lgals_age - zdiff ] demonstrates that this is indeed the case .",
    "given that the mass - weighted age correlates with the dilution time ( because no secular star formation occurs once dilution has started in these model galaxies ) , we can see that the oldest diluting galaxies ( black points ) have the lowest @xmath33 .",
    "we will now discuss the _ type _ of dilution that is occuring in our model diluting galaxies .",
    "the final panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : lgals_ssfr - z_maps ] ( panel i ) shows the net cooling rate of gas , taking into account the suppression from agn feedback .",
    "the _ gross _ cooling rate of hot gas from the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) is calculated following @xcite as ,    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the radius within which the cooling timescale is shorter than the dynamical time ( which is given by @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 is the radius out to which hot cgm gas extends in the system ( this is the virial radius for central galaxies ) .",
    "the agn reheating rate is calculated following @xcite as ,    @xmath43    where the rate of accretion onto the central bh , @xmath44 , is given by ,    @xmath45    and the hot accretion efficiency is @xmath46 .",
    "the _ net _ cooling rate is therefore ,    @xmath47    for more details , see @xcite ( 2011 ,  3.9 ) .",
    "panel i of fig .",
    "[ fig : lgals_ssfr - z_maps ] shows us that such ` diffuse ' cooling is completely shut - down in diluting galaxies , due to strong agn feedback , whereas it is still occurring in enriching galaxies . when plotting logarithmic values in this figure .",
    "] this indicates that the gradual dilution of diluting galaxies is _ not _ due to diffuse cooling of cgm gas , contrary to the conclusion made by ykg12 .",
    "instead , we have found that this gradual dilution is due to the accretion of low - mass satellites ( @xmath48 per cent by mass ) and cold gas clumps ( @xmath49 per cent by mass ) , carried - in by merging dm subhaloes .",
    "this merger - based accretion is _ not _ affected by the radio jets emitting from the central bh , and so can occur despite the presence of agn feedback .",
    "[ fig : gasfracpaper_lgals_prog_hists ] illustrates the significance of this mode of accretion for diluting galaxies .",
    "panel a shows that diluting galaxies tend to have a larger number of minor progenitors ( i.e. mergers ) since @xmath50 than enriching galaxies .",
    "this means that , although the _ average _ cold gas mass of a merging satellite is similar for both classes ( @xmath51 for diluting galaxies , and @xmath52 for enriching galaxies ) , the _ total _ mass of cold gas accreted is greater for diluting galaxies ( panel b ) .",
    "considering that diluting galaxies also have _ low _ cold gas masses themselves ( fig . [ fig : lgals_ssfr - z_maps ] , panel b ) , such merger - based accretion can have a significant impact on their cold gas content by @xmath3 .",
    "panel c of fig .",
    "[ fig : gasfracpaper_lgals_prog_hists ] illustrates this by showing the ratio of the total mass in cold gas accreted to the cold gas mass of the main progenitor at @xmath34 ( i.e. the gross increase in @xmath26 due to mergers ) . for enriching galaxies , the median ratio is @xmath53 per cent , whereas for diluting galaxies , satellites add an additional 88 per cent in cold gas on average",
    "this leads to enriching galaxies undergoing a net _ decrease _ in @xmath26 of 11 per cent on average , whereas diluting galaxies undergo a net _ increase _ in @xmath26 of 11 per cent on average , over the last 3.1 gyr .",
    "this accreted gas is more metal - poor than the cold gas in the central galaxy ( panel d ) , and therefore causes the significant dilution of the gas phase over time in diluting galaxies .",
    "the fact that this gas comes in during many minor merger events means that the dilution is gradual rather than sudden , with @xmath20 dropping by @xmath54 dex per gyr on average ( @xmath55 dex per gyr on average for those galaxies that show a consistent decrease in @xmath20 since @xmath34 ) .",
    "this drop in @xmath20 in low - sfr galaxies over time is the cause of the positive correlation between sfr and @xmath20 at high mass in the model fmr at @xmath3 .",

    "the accretion rate , @xmath56 , is calculated as the mass of cold gas obtained through mergers per year .",

    "[ fig : accsfrdiff_zcold_evo ] also shows the evolution of the cold gas accretion rate minus sfr . this is a measure of the relative dilution / enrichment of the ism ; positive values indicate a net dilution ( from infalling , metal - poor gas ) and negative values indicate a net enrichment ( from stars ) .",
    "we can see that enriching galaxies always have negative @xmath57 . this is true even when including gas cooled from the cgm in the calculation .",
    "diluting galaxies always have positive @xmath57 .",
    "this shows again how these systems are gradually diluting their ism over time .",
    "we note that the increase in @xmath57 for enriching galaxies is due to their average decline in sfr over time , reflecting the evolution of the cosmic sfr density @xcite .",
    "the low sfrs and fairly constant merger rates of diluting galaxies ensures that their @xmath57 remains fairly constant over time",
    ".    it may be surprising that massive , bulge - dominant galaxies are undergoing minor mergers containing cold gas in the model , when the current understanding is that such systems grow in mass and size predominantly through dissipationless , minor mergers ( @xmath58 @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , both these pictures are consistent with each other , as the median sfr of these diluting galaxies is only @xmath59 since @xmath60 , with only @xmath61 per cent of their present day stellar mass grown from forming new stars since then , on average .",

    "cooling of cgm gas can clearly be a significant mode of obtaining cold gas in enriching galaxies , whereas it is negligible in diluting galaxies due to the presence of agn feedback .",
    "this reflects the fact that accretion of cold gas via satellites and infalling gas clumps is the dominant mechanism for diluting galaxies in the model .    _",
    "_ in conclusion , we can say that there are a number of clear signatures of the dilution of some massive galaxies in the semi - analytic model that can be seen at @xmath3 . these include : lower gas - to - stellar mass ratios , older ages , higher bulge - to - total stellar mass ratios , higher central bh masses , and lower @xmath33 .",

    "the first thing we note when comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : lgals_ssfr - z_maps ] and [ fig : sdss_ssfr - z_maps ] is the different regions of parameter space covered .",

    "9 ) .    also , there is a greater fraction of low - ssfr galaxies in the model sample than in the observational sample .",
    "this is likely due to the difficulty in obtaining sfr , metallicity and gas mass estimates for such galaxies in the real universe , which will have intrinsically weaker emission line strengths , with lower snr .",
    "galaxies in this region of parameter space are also more likely to host agn , as we believe them to be post - merger systems with large black holes ( according to their model analogues ) , and so many may have been removed via the agn cut .    nonetheless , clear similarities can still be seen between the model and observational samples .",
    "[ fig : sdss_ssfr - z_maps ] shows that low - mass galaxies have lower sfrs ( panel b ) , lower hi masses ( estimated via the 21 cm line measurements of alfalfa and gass , panel c ) , higher gas - to - stellar mass ratios ( using both the z09 scaling relation , panel d , and direct estimates , panel i ) , lower metallicity differences ( panel e ) , larger concentration indices ( measured as the ratio of radius containing 90 per cent of the petrosian r - band light to the half - light radius , panel f ) , older ages ( inferred from the time since the last starburst via d@xmath1104000 , panel g ) , and lower - mass central black holes ( inferred from velocity dispersions via the @xcite combined @xmath25-@xmath7 relation , panel h ) .",

    "we also note that the majority of galaxies exhibiting low ionisation nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) have already been removed from our sample via the agn cut described in  [ sec : main sample ] .",

    "this is strong , indirect evidence for claiming that real galaxies have also undergone a gradual dilution of their gas phase , after the truncation of continuous star formation following a merger - induced starburst .",
    "however direct measurements of metal - poor gas infall onto these galaxies have not yet been made , and so further observational studies are required to confirm or deny the conclusions drawn from this work .",
    "there is already a class of spheroidal galaxy identified as possibly undergoing accretion of metal - poor gas , known as polar ring galaxies ( prgs ) @xcite .",

    ", they also have the first and third lowest metallicity differences , with @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively ( the median value for the diluting sub - sample is -0.19 ) .",
    "this could be an indication that metal - poor gas is _ gradually _ accreted onto such systems over time , again supporting the dilution scenario described in this work .",
    ", due to the narrow 3-arcsecond fibres used by the sdss . therefore , these objects may have lower overall @xmath0 than is observed . ]",
    "the fact that only two of our observed diluting galaxies are confirmed as prgs in the sprc suggests that this is not the main mechanism by which elliptical galaxies accrete metal - poor gas .",
    "indeed , the presence of an agn , which is often the case for our model diluting sub - sample , would likely preclude the accretion and cooling of gas from filaments ( although not necessarily from satellite stripping or mergers ) .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested that the bcg of abell 1664 , which hosts an agn , could be undergoing inflow of two molecular gas clumps , which could settle into a disc over several hundreds of megayears ( although , they also point out that this material could be part of an outflow , driven by agn feedback ) .",

    "however , the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , as well as l - galaxies , show that @xmath20 increases again shortly after a merger event , due to metal enrichment from the first supernov following the starburst . therefore , any dilution after this time would not be due to the initial interaction , and would have to occur through a second process ( such as accretion ) , in the absence of strong star formation .      as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : hi scaling relations ] , z09 also studied the dependence of the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation on hi gas mass fraction .",

    "this may seem to contradict the findings in this work at high mass .",
    "however , these two results are compatible with each other due to the difference in the sample selection .",
    "z09 selected galaxies with log(ssfr ) @xmath138 yr@xmath68 , meaning that only 45 per cent of the diluting galaxies we consider in our observational analysis , and none of the diluting galaxies in our model analysis , meet the same criterion .",
    "when we also select a sample of massive galaxies with log(ssfr ) @xmath138 yr@xmath68 , we recover similar trends to those found by z09 , for both our observational and model samples .",
    "it is the particular class of low - ssfr , diluting galaxies  that are _ not _ present in the z09 sample  which deviate from these trends by having low @xmath0 _ and _ low gas fractions at @xmath3 .",
    "the case is similar when comparing our results to those of @xcite , who also observed an anti - correlation between gas fraction and gas - phase metallicity in 260 local , late - type galaxies ( although this is difficult to determine at high mass , due to the low number of galaxies above @xmath139 in their sample ) .",
    "their selection of galaxies with @xmath140 yr@xmath68 also excludes most of the diluting galaxies analysed in this work .",
    "pleasingly , our findings support the cartoon model prediction described by @xcite . in that work",
    ", it was postulated that massive , low - ssfr , low-@xmath0 galaxies should have low gas fractions .",
    "our results , using a wide range of observational data and our galaxy formation model , show that this is indeed the case .",
    "we further argue that the cause of this trend is a gradual dilution of the gas phase after a merger - induced starburst .",
    "ykg12 have pointed - out that the shape of the fmr at @xmath3 is strongly dependent on the @xmath0 diagnostic chosen .",
    "consequently , there are conflicting conclusions in the literature as to the true nature of this @xmath1-sfr-@xmath0 relation at high mass @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to find viable physical processes that can _ explain _ a given correlation between @xmath1 , sfr and @xmath0 .",
    "there now appears to be three observationally - motivated explanations for why some massive galaxies can fall - off the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation to lower metallicities : a ) rapid dilution of the central regions of high - sfr , interacting galaxies ( @xmath58 @xcite ) , b ) the removal of dust and metals from low - sfr , secularly - evolving galaxies by radiation pressure ( known as the slow - flow , dust - efflux model , @xcite ) , and c ) gradual dilution of low - sfr , elliptical galaxies in the absence of secular star formation ( as proposed in this work ) .",
    "the second of these provides a direct explanation for the relation between @xmath1 and dust extinction in low-@xmath77 galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , it is not certain that the radiation - driven winds would be of higher _ metallicity _ than that measured in the galaxies hii regions .",
    "if any ( or a combination ) of these three mechanisms is happening to a significant number of galaxies at low redshift , then the shape of the fmr at high mass would be more complicated than first assumed .",
    "therefore , the full population of galaxies in the local universe would not be adequately fit by such a straightforward relation , and caution should be taken when using the fmr to describe galaxies with @xmath141 at low redshift .",
    "we have compared various physical properties of two classes of massive galaxy in the sdss - dr7 and munich semi - analytic model of galaxy formation , l - galaxies .",
    "these two classes are selected by their specific star formation rates and gas - phase metallicities ; high - ssfr , high-@xmath0 systems are labelled as ` enriching ' galaxies , and low - ssfr , low-@xmath0 system are labelled as ` diluting ' galaxies .",
    "the following results were obtained from this comparison :    * diluting galaxies in the semi - analytic model have higher bulge - to - total mass ratios , mass - weighted ages , and central black hole masses than model enriching galaxies at @xmath3 , and lower cold gas masses , gas - to - stellar mass ratios , and differences between their gas - phase and stellar metallicities . *",
    "these properties are all signatures of the specific evolution undergone by such galaxies  a gas - rich merger and subsequent starburst , followed by a cessation in secular star formation .",
    "a _ gradual _ dilution of the gas phase then takes place for up to several gigayears , via the accretion of metal - poor , cold gas in clumps and low - mass merging satellites .",
    "this gradual dilution drives the positive correlation between sfr and @xmath20 seen in massive galaxies at @xmath3 in the model . * _ all _ the signatures of the evolution described above are also seen in low - ssfr , low-@xmath0 , massive galaxies in the sdss - dr7 .",
    "of particular note are their elliptical morphologies , low gas fractions and low @xmath91 , which suggest dilution of the gas - phase in the absence of star formation .",
    "this is strong , indirect evidence that gradual dilution _",
    "after _ a gas - rich merger event is taking place in some elliptical galaxies in the local universe .",
    "* these results suggest an alternative mechanism by which galaxies can fall off the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation to lower metallicities . in this scenario ,",
    "galaxies remain at low @xmath0 for a longer period than possible via rapid dilution ( and re - enrichment ) _ during _ mergers and interactions . *",
    "the _ positive _ correlation found between sfr and @xmath0 in the local universe shows that current formulations of the fmr ( which assume a weak _ anti_-correlation between sfr and @xmath0 at high mass ) do not accurately represent the whole galaxy population .",
    "we close by highlighting some important limitations of the observational analysis in this work .",
    "first , the gas - phase metallicities used are measured from light falling within the 3-arcsecond aperture of the sdss fibres .",
    "this covers the inner @xmath142 to 9 kpc of galaxies in our main sample .",
    "gas lying at larger radii will therefore not be included in the metallicity estimates .",
    "second , a significant amount of high-@xmath1 , low-@xmath0 galaxies are missing from our observational analysis because of poorly - constrained estimates of their key physical properties . future observations of such galaxies gas content from near - ir absorption lines in the cgm ( @xmath58 @xcite ) , and gas - phase metallicity from temperature - insensitive emission lines in the far - ir ( @xmath58 @xcite ) would greatly help us probe this important part of the galaxy population . likewise , the wealth of information available for ( potentially ) low-@xmath0 agn - host galaxies remains untapped , due to the contamination of their spectra by emission from the nucleus .",
    "continued measurements of @xmath0 from their narrow - line regions ( @xmath58 @xcite ) , or of the molecular gas in and around these objects ( @xmath58 @xcite ) , would open - up these systems for future analysis .",

    "<S> we investigate whether gradual dilution of the gas in some elliptical galaxies is the cause of a positive correlation between star formation rate ( sfr ) and gas - phase metallicity ( @xmath0 ) at high stellar mass ( @xmath1 ) in the local universe . to do this , two classes of massive ( @xmath2 ) galaxy </S>",
    "<S> are selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the munich semi - analytic model of galaxy formation , l - galaxies . the first class is selected by high specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) and high @xmath0 , and the second class by low ssfr and low @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these criteria roughly distinguish disc - dominant galaxies from metal - poor , elliptical galaxies . in the semi - analytic model , </S>",
    "<S> the second class of galaxies obtain low ssfr and low @xmath0 due to _ gradual dilution _ of the interstellar medium by accretion of metal - poor gas via infalling clumps and low - mass satellites . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs after a merger - induced starburst and the associated supernova feedback have quenched most of the original gas reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> a number of signatures of this evolution are present in these model galaxies at @xmath3 , including low gas fractions , large central black holes , elliptical morphologies , old ages , and importantly , low @xmath4 indicating dilution after star formation . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , all of these properties are also found in low - ssfr , low-@xmath0 , massive galaxies in the sdss - dr7 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides strong , indirect evidence that some elliptical galaxies are undergoing gradual dilution after a gas - rich merger in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> this dilution scenario also explains the _ positive _ correlation between sfr and @xmath0 measured in high-@xmath1 galaxies , and therefore has consequences for the local fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) , which assumes a weak _ anti_-correlation between sfr and @xmath0 above @xmath5 .    </S>",
