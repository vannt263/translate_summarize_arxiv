    "collimated jets are ubiquitous in accreting systems across the mass scale , from protostars ( e.g. , @xcite ) to supermassive black holes in agn at the centers of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but the omnipresence of jets in astrophysical systems raises important questions .",
    "are all these jets produced by the same processes ?",
    "since one of the canonical jet formation mechanisms ( the blandford - znajek , or bz , mechanism ; @xcite ) , involves the rotation power of a black hole , it certainly can not operate in all systems .",
    "an alternative is the blandford - payne mechanism ( bp ; @xcite ) , in which the requisite rotation power comes from a rotating accretion disk . as a consequence , one expects bp jets to be baryonic , since they are magnetocentrifugal outflows from a gaseous reservoir .",
    "bz jets , on the other hand , might be electromagnetically dominated .    in this context , it is particularly interesting that accreting stellar - mass black holes appear to produce two different kinds of jets ( steady and transient ; for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , it remains unclear whether these two types of jets correspond to the two mechanisms described above ; a suggested association between the transient jets and the bz mechanism has lately been the subject of significant debate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the formation of steady jets is no less significant , as it has been suggested ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ) that ionized accretion disk winds may be able to quench steady jets .",
    "different processes may launch astrophysical jets at different scales or under different conditions , but because a jet s energy requirements are sensitive to its baryon content ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , these considerations have broad and concrete implications for radio - mode feedback from accreting systems .        recently , @xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter ) reported a detection of relativistically - blueshifted emission lines associated with radio emission in the stellar - mass black hole candidate 4u 163047 , a well - known recurrent transient ( @xcite ) that went into outburst in december 2011 ( @xcite ) .",
    "reported on two observations of the source with _ xmm - newton _ and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in 2012 september . in their first observation",
    "( september 10 - 12 ) , they found a featureless x - ray spectrum and no radio emission . in their second observation",
    "( september 28 - 29 ) , however , they discovered optically thin radio emission and x - ray emission lines at energies that do not correspond to strong lines from abundant elements .",
    "they argued that the emission lines originated in a relativistic jet with a speed of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the speed of light . in their interpretation",
    ", the lines corresponded to red- and blueshifted fexxvi ly@xmath4 and blueshifted nixxvii he@xmath4 .    in this paper , we report on atca and _ chandra _ high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; @xcite ) observations of the same outburst of 4u 163047 .",
    "although we detect radio emission at levels brighter than those reported in , we do not detect the x - ray emission lines seen later in the outburst .",
    "indeed , our _ chandra _ spectra place tight upper limits on such features , and we can conclusively say that radio emission is not universally associated with relativistically doppler - shifted emission lines in 4u 163047 . while our results do not and can not directly address the argument for the presence of baryons in the 2012 september jet in 4u 163047 , we highlight the necessity of a complex relationship between x - ray and radio emission , considering not only the possibility of undetected baryons in the january and june jets or baryonic jets confined to a particular accretion state , but also an alternative scenario in which the radio emission arises in a jet - ism interaction and could be decoupled from the x - ray emission .",
    "after the peak of the outburst around 2012 january 1 , we triggered our _ chandra _ hetgs campaign , observing the source for @xmath5 ks four times : january 17 ( 4:23:43 ut ) , january 20 ( 23:43:52 ut ) , january 26 ( 13:00:35 ut ) , and january 30 ( 8:48:41 ut ) .",
    "the data were taken in graded mode with a grey filter over the zeroth order to reduce the risk of telemetry saturation from the bright source .",
    "we also obtained a 19 ks hetgs ddt in continuous - clocking ( cc ) mode ( 2012 june 3 22:19:16 ut ) when 4u 163047 entered an active state .",
    "we show the maxi/_swift _ outburst light curves and maxi hardness - intensity diagram in figure [ fig : lc ] .",
    "we reduce the _ chandra _ data with standard ciao data reduction tools to create first - order high - energy grating ( heg ) spectra and response files . performing all our analysis within the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis ; @xcite ) ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the 1.79 kev band .",
    "we also triggered an atca monitoring campaign at 5.5 and 9 ghz , observing the source at 10 epochs between 2012 january 28 and june 4 .",
    "the observations were conducted with the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ; @xcite ) with the array in a number of configurations ranging from h168 ( compact ) to 6a ( extended ) . each frequency band",
    "was composed of 2048 1-mhz channels .",
    "we used pks1934638 for absolute flux and bandpass calibration , and j160048 to calibrate the antenna gains as a function of time .",
    "flagging , calibration and imaging were carried out with the multichannel image reconstruction , image analysis and display ( miriad ) software ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the visibilities from the shortest baselines were excluded from the imaging step to avoid flux contamination from an extended source very close to 4u 163047 .",
    "we measured flux densities by fitting a point source in the image plane , and we achieve a significant detection of 4u 163047 at 5.5 and 9 ghz in every observation with useful data .",
    "the resulting atca light curves are plotted in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : lc ] and appear to show an optically thin flare that lasts @xmath6 days and then fades slowly as the spectrum flattens .",
    "during their second observation of 4u 163047 ( mjd 56181 ) , reported radio fluxes of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9jy at 5.5 ghz and 9 ghz , respectively . in order to perform the most robust comparison",

    "in their second _ xmm - newton_/atca observation of 4u 163047 in 2012 september , discovered relativistically doppler - shifted fe and ni emission lines whose appearance coincided with steep - spectrum radio emission . but despite the @xmath0 brighter steep - spectrum radio emission during our atca observations in 2012 january , we found no evidence for the emission lines in our contemporaneous _",
    "chandra _ observations . with a tight upper limit on the blueshifted fexxvi emission line flux",
    "( it must have been @xmath1 fainter than reported by eight months later ) , what can be said about the evolution of the baryon content of the jet in 4u 163047 ? what is the significance of _ chandra _ s non - detection of blueshifted emission lines ?    here we will focus on our january campaign , since it provides the strongest constraints .",
    "we can explain the absence of the lines in light of two scenarios : ( 1 ) there were relativistic baryons in the jet at the time of our campaign , but their x - ray emission was negligible , or ( 2 ) there were no relativistic baryons in the jet .",
    "of course there is middle ground , but these scenarios span the plausible range of explanations .",
    "below , we consider them in turn . in section [ sec : dt13 ] we also discuss the association between the radio emission and relativistic lines seen by .",
    "first , we suppose that despite the non - detection of baryonic emission during our _ chandra_/atca campaign , the jet had the same baryon content as in the _",
    "xmm_/atca observations .",
    "specifically , we assume the jet emission mechanisms were the same ( but see section [ sec : dt13 ] ) , and we consider either the jet baryon number density @xmath67 or the total number of jet baryons @xmath68 to be fixed .",
    "these considerations are reasonable in context because modeled the baryonic emission in their _ xmm _ spectrum as a 21 kev thermal plasma , for which the model normalization @xmath69 is proportional to @xmath70 @xmath71 is the electron density , @xmath72 is the density of hydrogen , and the integral is over the emitting volume @xmath73 .    to suppress the plasma emission by @xmath74 we can therefore invoke a smaller baryon density or a reduced number of baryons in the jet .",
    "keeping @xmath68 fixed and reducing @xmath67 would require a @xmath75 larger jet , while keeping @xmath67 fixed and reducing the total number of baryons would require a @xmath75 smaller jet .",
    "physically , these scenarios could represent a jet at a different stage of formation . in either case (",
    "@xmath67 or @xmath68 fixed ) , some fine tuning of the plasma parameters would also be needed , since the optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet is sensitive to both the volume and the electron density in the emitting region .",
    "alternatively , we might explain the non - detection of the iron emission line by invoking a variation in the plasma temperature that significantly reduces the abundance of fexxvi and its emissivity .",
    "however , we can effectively rule out such a temperature variation by querying the apec database that underlies the bvapec model used by : the emissivity of fexxvi drops to 5% of its value at temperatures ( 1 ) below @xmath76 kev , where emission from fexxv would have been even more apparent , and ( 2 ) well above 100 kev , which would be difficult to reconcile with our cooler accretion disk and no apparent power law component in the x - ray spectrum . as noted in , extreme line broadening could also effectively hide such lines , but the iron line would need to be nearly an order of magnitude broader to be undetectable with _ chandra _ , and it is difficult to explain such a large change in the expansion speed of the jet .      perhaps the simplest interpretation is the one that takes our data at face value : we did not observe relativistic iron emission lines with _ chandra _ because there were no baryons in the 2012 january jet .",
    "in this interpretation , the question is not why we did not observe the relativistic emission lines , but why did .",
    "what changed in the accretion flow between our campaign and theirs ( and , for that matter , between their two reported _ xmm _ observations ) ?",
    "the most significant difference in the observations appears to be the accretion state .",
    "as noted above , the x - ray luminosity of 4u 163047 in the second xmm observation was @xmath77 higher than in january and june .",
    "notably , that luminosity corresponds to a significant fraction ( @xmath78 ) of the eddington luminosity for a 10 @xmath79 black hole at a distance of 10 kpc , and @xmath80 of the emission was in a hard power law .",
    "these facts raise the possibility that the stronger , brighter non - thermal component , the very high accretion power , or the extreme luminosity of the source may have played a role in lifting and/or helping to accelerate heavy particles .",
    "it is also worth considering whether or not the relativistic emission lines are indicative of baryonic matter in a relativistic jet , or if they can truly be associated with the radio emission at all .",
    "the primary reasons for this are that radio jets have been somewhat elusive in 4u 163047 ( @xcite ) , and our atca detections in january are atypical for steady jets from stellar - mass black holes . as mentioned in section [ sec : atca ] , our radio light curve looks like a faint , optically thin flare that lasts many weeks .",
    "since our initial atca detections of very faint optically thin emission occur @xmath6 days after a major hard - soft state transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ; mjd @xmath81 ) , and in what appears to be a standard disk - dominated state , we are inclined to interpret them as indicative of a jet - ism interaction far from the black hole . see @xcite and references therein for a thorough discussion of similar detections in spectrally soft states",
    ".    given the similar optically - thin spectrum , could the 2012 september 28 radio emission also originate in a jet - ism interaction ?",
    "inspection of the light curves and hardness - intensity diagram in figure [ fig : lc ] reveals that between june and september there was a transition from a spectrally hard state to a softer state , although the date is difficult to identify precisely .",
    "such transitions are usually associated with a transient ejection , and the optically thick radio emission in june might indicate the start of radio flaring periods typical of these transitions . if the associated ejection reached the ism @xmath82 months later , it could potentially explain the radio emission in the second _ xmm_/atca observation .",
    "if that is the case , then the relativistic lines might not have been associated with the radio source at all , i.e. , the radio emission could have been produced in the nearby ism , while the x - ray lines were local to 4u 163047 .",
    "for example , at a temperature of 21 kev , a relativistic wind would appear in emission in front of the accretion disk , although some obscuration , absorption , or geometrical effects might be needed to explain the line profiles .",
    "however , we can not say for certain that the radio emission mechanism was the same in january and september , so the possibility remains that we observed a jet - ism interaction early in the outburst and dt13 observed a baryon - loaded jet later in the outburst .",
    "it may be possible to test these interpretations with future observations of that luminous second state .",
    "regardless , it is clear that the observations from 2012 trace a complex relationship between the physics of the radio jet and the x - ray spectrum in 4u 163047 .",
    "the baryon content of astrophysical jets has important consequences for our understanding of their formation and their effects on their environment , but it is difficult to measure directly . @xcite have argued that their detection of relativistically doppler - shifted emission lines in 4u 163047 in september 2012 ( mjd 56181 ) implies the presence of a baryonic jet , most likely launched from the rotating accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can not directly test this interpretation , but in this paper we have used _",
    "hetgs observations from earlier in the same outburst ( january / june , mjd @xmath83 ) to demonstrate that radio emission in 4u 163047 is not always associated with relativistic x - ray emission lines .",
    "the unique behavior observed with _ xmm - newton _ and atca later in the outburst may be a special case , dependent on additional processes in the accretion flow around the black hole .",
    "however , because much of the observed radio emission from 4u 163047 in 2012 is consistent with jet - ism interactions , we can not rule out scenarios where the x - ray emission lines originate in a hot outflow that is not physically related to the radio source . further analysis of the x - ray and radio emission ( neilsen et al . , in preparation ) may help test our interpretation of this exciting physics .",
