    "the result is consistent with the gnevyshev ",

    "yet it is difficult to distinguish linear and nonlinear decays observationally , and observations have also been interpreted using a parabolic decay law , with @xmath7 a decreasing quadratic function of time ( moreno - insertis & vzquez 1988 ; martnez pillet et al .",
    "1993 ) .    on the theoretical side , meyer et al .",
    "( 1974 ) argued that the linear decay law is a consequence of turbulent diffusion of the magnetic field across the whole area of a sunspot and expressed the constant decay rate in terms of a constant uniform diffusivity ( see also krause & rdiger 1975 ) .",
    "simon & leighton ( 1964 ) inferred from observations that the gradual disintegration of sunspots is due to `` erosion '' of the penumbral boundaries by supergranular flows , which occurs when bits of magnetic field are sliced away from the edges of the sunspot and swept to the supergranular cell boundaries .",
    "in contrast to the model of meyer et al .",
    "( 1974 ) , such erosion can occur if the turbulent diffusivity associated with the flows is suppressed within the spot ( petrovay & moreno - insertis 1997 ) .",

    "petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) developed the turbulent erosion model mathematically , taking into account the dependence of the turbulent diffusivity on the magnetic field strength .",

    "waldmeier relation .",
    "petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) concluded that solar observations are consistent with turbulent erosion based on a granule - size diffusion length .",
    "petrovay & van driel - gesztelyi ( 1997 ) presented observational evidence in favor of the parabolic decay rate , predicted by the turbulent erosion model , although an independent magnetohydrodynamic simulation suggested that the sunspot decay law is almost linear ( rdiger & kitchatinov 2000 ) .",
    "petrovay et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also explored the effect of a preexisting `` plage '' field on the decay rate , whereas chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2006 ) applied the model to the development of twist in a flux tube rising through the solar convection zone .",
    "the analytical results of the turbulent erosion model have been recently used to complement numerical simulations of sunspot formation and decay ( e.g. , rempel & cheung 2014 ) . the model has also been applied to starspots , with a goal of using the starspot decay data to place constraints on the magnetic diffusivity , which may be useful for dynamo models ( e.g. , strassmeier 2009 ; bradshaw & hartigan 2014 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to revisit the turbulent erosion model of sunspot decay .",
    "the original calculation of petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) was guided by numerical results and one - dimensional analytical solutions .",
    "a dimensional argument was used to estimate the magnetic field gradient at the sunspot edge : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the magnetic field value above which the turbulent diffusivity is assumed to be suppressed ( see equations ( 11 ) through ( 16 ) in petrovay & moreno - insertis 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , their numerical estimate for the sunspot lifetime appears to be based on an estimate of the current sheet speed @xmath8 rather than on direct computation .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the sunspot decay law is necessary if the theory is to be used to develop reliable predictive tools .",
    "explicit analytical predictions of the turbulent erosion model could complement more detailed numerical ( e.g. , hurlburt & derosa 2008 ) and empirical ( gafeira et al . 2014 ) models of sunspot decay .",
    "hence our aim is to put the turbulent erosion model on a firmer footing .",
    "we do this by formulating a moving boundary problem ( carslaw & jaeger 1959 ; crank 1984 ) for the model and solving it to derive a prediction for the sunspot decay law . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we present the new analytical ( section 2 ) and numerical ( section 3 ) results and their discussion ( section 4 ) .",
    "in order to model the turbulent erosion of a sunspot , we follow petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) and consider the evolution of a cylindrically symmetric magnetic flux tube .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath14 is described by the diffusion equation @xmath15 here @xmath1 is time , and @xmath16 is the distance from the @xmath17-axis .",
    "the turbulent diffusivity @xmath18 is strongly suppressed when the magnetic field exceeds an energy equipartition value @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass density and @xmath21 is a characteristic turbulent speed ( e.g. , kitchatinov et al .",
    "for instance , taking a photospheric value of @xmath22 g @xmath23 and a granular value of @xmath24 cm s@xmath25 yields @xmath26 g ( petrovay & moreno - insertis 1997 ) . to simplify the analytical treatment , we assume @xmath27 and @xmath28 the initial value problem is specified by the field profile @xmath29 and @xmath30 otherwise ( see tlatov & pevtsov ( 2014 ) for recent data on sunspot magnetic fields ) .",
    "we nondimensionalize the problem by measuring the magnetic fields , times , and distances in units of @xmath13 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the sunspot size decreases with time because the magnetic flux is removed by diffusion .",
    "the strongly nonlinear dependence of the diffusivity @xmath33 on the magnetic field strength leads to the formation of a tangential discontinuity at the edge @xmath34 of the flux tube .",
    "physically , the magnetic field discontinuity at @xmath35 corresponds to a current sheet at the sunspot edge , where the magnetic flux removal is made possible by a strongly localized electric current .",
    "it is useful to observe that the problem at hand is mathematically similar to a moving boundary problem in the theory of heat conduction , and so we can use existing methods of analysis .",
    "in particular , an analog of the stefan condition is obtained by the integration of the governing diffusion equation across the moving boundary @xmath36 ( carslaw & jaeger 1959 ) . allowing for the tangential discontinuity at @xmath36 , we substitute @xmath37 , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the heaviside step function , into equation ( [ eq - axisymm - diff ] ) and integrate across the discontinuity ( from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath41 where we used @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .    to find an approximate analytical solution , we use the pseudo - steady - state approximation that can be adopted when the rate of change @xmath45 is small compared with a global diffusion rate @xmath46 , making it possible to neglect the term @xmath47 in equation ( [ eq - axisymm - diff ] ) .",
    "physically , the magnetic field profile near a moving boundary relaxes to a pseudo - steady state on a time scale @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the displacement of the boundary @xmath35 in a time @xmath50 . the approximation is valid if the relaxation is sufficiently rapid , say if @xmath51 . in our dimensionless variables",

    "we show below that roughly @xmath58 . consequently",
    ", the pseudo - steady - state approximation becomes more accurate as @xmath59 increases .",
    "detailed analysis of the accuracy of the approximation can be found in standard textbooks on heat conduction ( e.g. , crank 1984 ; hill & dewynne 1987 ) .    inside the spot",
    ", the vanishing diffusivity implies that the magnetic field is constant : @xmath60 outside the spot , the pseudo - steady - state field satisfies @xmath61 and so @xmath62 equation ( [ eq - diffusivity ] ) gives the boundary condition @xmath63 which would be @xmath64 in dimensional units .",
    "the magnetic field diffusion outside the spot causes the field to become negligibly small at some @xmath65 outside the spot .",
    "solutions of the standard diffusion equation in two dimensions suggest that @xmath66 ( carslaw & jaeger 1959 ) .",
    "thus we set @xmath67 the solution of equation ( [ eq - steady ] ) , satisfying the boundary conditions at @xmath68 and @xmath69 , is given by @xmath70 on substituting this into equation ( [ eq - stefan ] ) , we get @xmath71    we also obtained a similar differential equation for @xmath72 using an independent heat - balance approximation ( e.g. , crank 1984 ) .",
    "we do not present the results here : although the approach requires longer calculations , it does not appear to be more accurate than the pseudo - steady - state approximation .    equation ( [ eq - re - ode ] ) does not appear to have a solution in elementary functions .",
    "the magnitude of its right - hand side is of order unity , which yields an order - of - magnitude estimate @xmath73 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "next we obtain a more accurate solution of equation ( [ eq - re - ode ] ) .",
    "an approximate polynomial solution would be convenient for comparison with the available observational results and theoretical predictions .",
    "we use a quadratic approximation : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 we expand @xmath79 about @xmath80 because this is where the pseudo - steady - state approximation is expected to be most accurate .",
    "the remaining constants @xmath81 and @xmath5 are defined by the conditions @xmath82 and @xmath83 equations ( [ eq - taylor ] ) , ( [ eq - r2-t=0 ] ) , and ( [ eq - r2-t = t ] ) give @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the sunspot lifetime , unless @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the other root of the equation @xmath88 .",
    "we evaluate the constant @xmath89 by substituting the order - of - magnitude estimates @xmath90 and @xmath75 into equation ( [ eq - re - ode ] ) .",
    "this yields an accurate expression for @xmath89 because @xmath91 and @xmath92 only appear in the argument of the logarithm in equation ( [ eq - re - ode ] ) .",
    "the resulting prediction for the sunspot lifetime is as follows : @xmath93 which should be compared with equation ( 16 ) in petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) for the inward speed @xmath94 of the current sheet . in their model , @xmath95 and",
    "the sunspot lifetime is given by @xmath96 , which leads to @xmath97 in our dimensionless variables .",
    "the same result ( up to a numerical coefficient ) is obtained by nondimensionalizing our equation ( [ eq - pm - scaling ] ) , substituting it into equation ( [ eq - stefan ] ) , and assuming @xmath98 .",

    "our analytical predictions agree with the numerical results : in particular the rates of increase of decay time with @xmath59 are quite similar .",
    "although our analytical model underestimates the decay times , it is significantly more accurate than the earlier model .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our calculation generally yields a time - dependent rate of decrease of the fluxtube radius @xmath72 .",
    "equation ( [ eq - our - parabola ] ) predicts that the deviation from the parabolic decay law , derived by petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) , should increase as the initial magnetic field @xmath59 increases . as a result ,",
    "a linear decay law ( rather than a parabolic one ) should become more accurate as @xmath59 increases , although the logarithmic dependence on @xmath59 makes the effect rather weak .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the effect of doubling the field strength @xmath59 on the shape of the function @xmath79 .",
    "while the computation time and numerical errors increase for larger @xmath59 , we do see numerical evidence that the decay law becomes more linear for a larger initial magnetic field , which is consistent with our analytical prediction .",
    "we have presented in this paper a quantitative theory of sunspot decay by turbulent erosion , considered as a moving boundary problem .",
    "the physical mechanism of sunspot erosion was proposed by simon & leighton ( 1964 ) , and a sunspot decay law due to turbulent erosion was derived by petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) ( see also petrovay et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "although petrovay and collaborators correctly identified the key dependence of the decay rate on the sunspot magnetic field @xmath59 , the accuracy of the analytical predictions was limited : for instance , we have shown that the numerically computed sunspot lifetime is about a half of that predicted .",
    "our equation ( [ eq - lifetime ] ) for the sunspot decay time @xmath5 is an improvement on equation ( [ eq - lifetime - pm ] ) , derived by petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq - our - parabola ] ) confirms that the decay law for the sunspot area @xmath141 is in general parabolic , as long as higher - order terms in @xmath142 can be neglected .",
    "equation ( [ eq - our - parabola ] ) also quantifies the accuracy of the assumption , made by petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) , that the inward speed @xmath45 of the current sheet surrounding the decaying spot is constant .",
    "we have shown that the assumption is justified if the initial sunspot magnetic field @xmath59 is not too large .",
    "equation ( [ eq - our - parabola ] ) predicts that a linear decay law should become more accurate as @xmath59 increases .",
    "the numerical solutions in figure  [ fig4 ] confirm this prediction , although , as noted by the referee , they also show that the deviation from a linear decay is systematically underestimated in the analytical model .",
    "application of the turbulent erosion theory to sunspot and starspot decay is a topic of current research interest ( e.g. , strassmeier 2009 ; rempel & cheung 2014 ; bradshaw & hartigan 2014 ) , and so our quantitative analytical predictions , reinforced by numerical solutions , should be useful in studies of solar and stellar activity .",
    "the value of an analytical calculation is that it can be used to verify more detailed magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , hurlburt & derosa 2008 ; rempel & cheung 2014 ) and to guide empirical models ( e.g. , gafeira et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the erosion model can be further refined .",
    "for instance , we assumed @xmath143 in our analysis of section 2 .",
    "the rate of relative diffusion of two photospheric magnetic fragments is controlled by turbulent eddies whose size is equal to the current distance between the fragments .",
    "consequently , the turbulent diffusivity is expected to be scale - dependent . in practice",
    "the turbulent diffusivity is determined by applying the induction equation to pairs of solar magnetograms ( e.g. , chae et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "scale - dependent turbulent diffusivity has been invoked to interpret observations of photospheric flux cancellation ( litvinenko 2011 ) and the dispersion of photospheric bright points ( abramenko et al .",
    "2011 ) . the turbulent erosion model of sunspot decay should be generalized to incorporate the dependence of the effective diffusivity on the size of a decaying sunspot .",
    "in addition , although petrovay & moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) argued that regular radial flows play little if any role in sunspot decay , the effect of regular photospheric flows on sunspot decay should be investigated in more detail . finally , recent observations emphasized the difference between the maximum and average sunspot magnetic field strengths ( tlatov & pevtsov 2014 ) , and so it may be worthwhile to derive a solution for a more general initial profile of the magnetic field within the sunspot , as well as a more realistic dependence of the turbulent diffusivity on the field strength within the spot .",
