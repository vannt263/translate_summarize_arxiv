    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ f : mos2](d ) clearly shows that @xmath126 increases exponentially with roughness amplitude of up to four order of magnitude over a variation of @xmath88 from @xmath127  pm to @xmath128  pm .",

    "f : mos2](d ) ) . as explained before two scattering mechanisms affect spin transport : surface corrugation and spin - orbit interaction , which is enhanced with surface roughness .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the spin - flip scattering rate is similar for electron and hole sectors . since we are dealing with ribbon geometry both , the edge states and the folding of the brillouin zone , play an important role . in particular",
    ", it is very important to notice that the bands ( fig .",
    "2a ) are spin degenerate ( for both , electron and hole sectors ) for the armchair nanoribbons considered here .",
    "this is completely different to the case of bulk single layer or zigzag nanoribbons,@xcite where spin - valley coupling is more robust for valence band states , since valence band edges at k and k valleys correspond to opposite spin , and they are well separated in energy from the other subband ( the separation is @xmath131150 mev for mos@xmath0 and @xmath131400 ev for ws@xmath0 ) .",
    "the armchair termination is a line of dimers with atoms of the two sublattices , therefore the edge states present valley mixing , as it happens in graphene armchair ribbons ( see e.g. refs . ) .",
    "furthermore , the orbital contribution for the low energy states of both , valence and conduction bands , are rather similar , as it can be seen in fig . [",
    "f : orbital ] .",
    "this is due to the band folding that happens for a finite ribbon , with the result that , at the @xmath120 point of the ribbon bz , there are contributions from bulk states at @xmath120 and k points .",
    "the consequence of this band reconstruction is that , due to the spin degeneracy of the bands and the similar orbital character for electron and hole sectors , the spin - flip scattering probability is of the same order in the two cases .",
    "we have considered other kinds of corrugations like periodic sinusoidal rippling of the sample . we have observed that this kind of corrugation , which can be induced in the laboratory by using elastomeric substrates,@xcite leads to qualitatively similar effects in the spin - flip transmission @xmath126 ( not shown here ) but of much weaker magnitude as compared to random gaussian modulation .",
    "we have also checked that bending of the ribbon leads to reduction of @xmath126 as the curvature radius increases . for this case ,",
    "the polarised transmission is also much smaller than the obtained with the gaussian corrugation .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the spin - flip relative transmission ( sfrt ) @xmath132 , which is a measure of the efficiency of spin control.@xcite as expected , the ensemble average of @xmath133 as a function of energy ( fig .",
    "[ f : sfrt](a ) ) increases with surface roughness amplitude .",
    "we next compare @xmath133 for edge- and bulk - states , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ f : sfrt](b ) .",
    "the amplitude of the edge - state wave functions across the width of the armchair ribbon is originated mainly from @xmath1-orbitals of the metal ( mo or w ) and it is localised at the border atoms , decreasing with the distance to the edge .",
    "our results show that bulk - states are strongly affected by surface roughness , whereas edge - states are more robust against corrugations which results in a lower @xmath133 .",
    "this is expected since the spatial localization of edge states protect them partially from surface corrugation effects .",
    "the results for transport from purely bulk states are shown in appendix [ app : periodic ] , where we show simulations with periodic boundary conditions . at high energies and large @xmath88 ,",
    "@xmath133 reaches 0.5 that implies a complete loss of spin - information during transmission .",
    "this clearly suggest that substrates with rough surfaces , such as the most commonly used sio@xmath0 , are not appropriate for spintronic applications based on tmdc materials ( see table [ tab : rms ] ) .",
    "the spin - flip ratio ( @xmath113 ) is another important figure of merit for spintronic devices , defined as @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 , are the spin - conserving and spin - flip conductances respectively.@xcite the conductance in the linear regime is given by@xcite @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 is the fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath140 is the transmission , eq .",

    "[ f : p ] for @xmath141  ev , coinciding with an edge state band , and for @xmath142  ev , which crosses the bulk bands .",
    "the reduction of @xmath113 with @xmath88 suggests again that the spin - flip rate is increased by the surface corrugation .",
    "smaller @xmath113 is observed for higher values of the fermi energy .",
    "this is due to the smaller effect of corrugations on edge states and to the larger density of states at high energies , which cause more spin - flip processes .",
    "a similar effect has been observed in graphene.@xcite    finally in fig .",
    "[ f : pl ] we show the dependence of @xmath113 with the channel length , for the the same values of the fermi energy .",
    "we observe that the decay of @xmath113 with the channel length is more pronounced for @xmath142  ev ( crossing bulk states ) than for @xmath141  ev ( crossing edge states ) .",
    "this can be understood again from the fact that spin transport in the second case occurs mainly through the edges , for which we have seen that the effect of corrugations is small . however , when the fermi level crosses the bulk states , strongly affected by corrugations , @xmath113 decreases faster with the length of the channel .",
    "in summary , we have performed a systematic theoretical study on spin transport in mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 armchair nanoribbons in the presence of surface roughness . in the perfectly flat ribbons ,",
    "the spin - flip terms contribution are negligiblie . nonetheless , when surface roughness is present , surface mirror symmetry or @xmath3-axis symmetry is broken generating an additional rashba - like contribution to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the strength of this coupling is proportional to the atomic soc and increases with the corrugation amplitude .",
    "deformation of the surface by ripples , bending or corrugation , modulates the atomic positions thus changing the atomic interactions and orbital hybridisation .",
    "the results indicate that sample corrugations significantly enhance the spin - flip rate . for the same surface roughness ,",
    "the spin - flip rate is larger in ws@xmath0 than in mos@xmath0 due to the stronger intrinsic soc of heavier w atoms .",
    "our results indicate that the spin information can be completely suppressed in tmdcs - based channel with armchair termination supported on rough substrates , such as sio@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the use of flat substrates or the application of techniques to stretch the mos@xmath0 or ws@xmath0 samples , avoiding undesirable corrugations , can improve the performance of tmdcs based spintronics devices .",
