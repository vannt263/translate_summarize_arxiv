    "the majorana bound state ( mbs ) naturally exists in spin - triplet chiral @xmath1-wave superconductivity in superfluid he@xmath2 ( a - phase )  @xcite and sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4  @xcite and in the fractional quantum hall state at @xmath5 filling  @xcite .",
    "also , there have been several proposals of experimentally feasible systems that host mbs such as quantum wire coupled to @xmath6-wave superconductor  @xcite , semiconductor - superconductor heterostructure  @xcite , proximity - induced superconductor at the surface of topological insulator  @xcite , 2deg at semiconducting quantum well  @xcite , and the more promising al - insb nanowire topological superconductor  @xcite .",
    "also there is a trend to realize topological orders in fermionic @xmath6-wave superfluids of ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the lack of convincing experimental evidence so far , majorana fermion still remains as elusive and its search , therefore , should expand on to uncharted routes , new systems and novel experimental designs .",
    "the two - dimensional electron liquid ( 2del ) at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface is formed as a result of an intrinsic electronic transfer mechanism known as the polar catastrophe in which half an electronic charge is transferred from the top of the polar laalo@xmath0 to the terminating tio@xmath3 layer on the non - polar srtio@xmath0 side to avoid a charge discontinuity at the interface  @xcite .",
    "the 2del becomes superconducting below @xmath7mk",
    "@xcite along with large magnetic moment ( @xmath80.3 - 0.4 @xmath9 ) aligned parallel to the interface plane  @xcite .",
    "suggestions for the mechanism responsible for the novel ferromagnetism include a rkky interaction  @xcite , a double exchange process  @xcite and oxygen vacancies  @xcite developed at the interface during the deposition process . on the other hand , there are proposals for phonon - mediated electron - pairing  @xcite as well as unconventional superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "another important feature of the interface is the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) which arises because of the broken mirror symmetry along perpendicular to the interface .",
    "a back - gate voltage can tune both the electron concentration and the rashba soi and therefore can drive a superconductor - insulator transition  @xcite making the system a potential candidate for novel electronic devices  @xcite .    here",
    "we show that a magnetic field , applied perpendicular to the interface plane , can induce topological superconductivity that harbours gapless edge states and mbs at the core of a vortex .",
    "the intrinsic in - plane magnetization favours a finite momentum pairing and , therefore , weakens the topological superconducting phase .",
    "we show that by tuning the rashba soi ( _ i.e. _ the back - gate voltage ) the topological superconducting phase can be stabilized against the deterrent effect of the in - plane magnetization .",
    "we study the in - gap excitations and find that the zero - energy mbs located at the vortex - core is accompanied by low - energy particle - hole symmetric in - gap states of electronic origin .",
    "we study the effect of non - magnetic disorder on the low - energy excitations and observe that the mbs vanishes with moderate disorder .",
    "we propose an experimental set - up where the existence of mbs can be tested experimentally and discuss about some future directions .",

    "we show that the tunable rsoi competes with the in - plane magnetization and restores the topological phase .",
    "however , we find that the excitation at the vortex core is highly sensitive to non - magnetic disorder ; even a moderate disorder can destroy the mbs as the magnetization breaks time - reversal symmetry explicitly . as the interface in lao / sto possesses intrinsic disorders like oxygen vacancies , developed during the deposition process",
    ", it is indeed quite challenging to detect a majorana fermion here . some remedies and possible experimental requirements for realizing the mbs in this system are discussed .",
    "the electrons in the 2del occupy the three @xmath18-bands ( _ viz . _ d@xmath19 , d@xmath20 and d@xmath21 ) of ti atoms in the terminating tio@xmath3 plane giving rise to a quarter - filled ground state .",

    "the transition to the topological state occurs only when the gap of the bulk spectrum closes _ i.e. _ , when @xmath52 .",

    "@xcite when @xmath57 .",

    "therefore , @xmath58 keeps track of the quantum phase transition from ordinary superconductivity to topological superconductivity .",
    "the phase diagrams of the system , revealing the parameter regime in which the topological superconductivity can be achieved , is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "there are two competing energy gaps , the minimum of which tries to destroy the topological state ; one is the induced bulk excitation gap at the fermi level ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 , the other is the zeeman gap at the point p , given by @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , the in - plane magnetization , by introducing a finite - momentum pairing , weakens the topological superconductivity .",
    "however , the rsoi competes with the in - plane magnetization to restore the topological state , which is clearly visible in the phase diagram , fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "since the rsoi in laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface is tunable by external gate voltage  @xcite , it can be tuned to stabilize the topological state .",
    "the induced topological superconductivity exhibits edge states and zero - energy mbs at the core of a vortex  @xcite .",
    "since majorana fermions are essentially half an ordinary fermion , they always come in pair , generally located in different vortex - cores .",
    "a system having only one vortex , hosts the second majorana fermion at the boundary .",
    "the topological property of the gapless excitation at the boundary is connected to the bulk topological state as a consequence of the `` bulk - boundary correspondence '' . in the following",

    "these states exist in both the normal and topological superconducting phase .",
    "with increasing @xmath14 , the fermionic states move away and mix with the bulk bands and the mbs vanishes suddenly as @xmath14 reaches the critical value for transition to the trivial superconducting state .",
    "the majorana excitation at the vortex core is shown in fig .",
    "[ vortex](b ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ vortex](c ) , the bulk band - gap reduces slowly with increasing @xmath35 and the low - energy fermionic excitations merge with the mbs .",
    "remarkably , similar features of the ldos , for various gate voltages , have been seen in the tunneling spectra obtained at 50 mk using au - gated lao / sto tunnel device  @xcite .",
    "[ vortex](d)-(e ) show three regimes : regimes i , ii and iii are all superconducting : region ii has a magnetized vortex and only region iii has non - trivial superconductivity and the majorana modes ( two red lines at zero energy for the vortex - core and edge excitations ) .",
    "region ii is quite interesting as it has a zero energy fermionic excitation close to the boundary of i which arises in this trivial superconducting state from the competition between the zeeman field that magnetizes the vortex and the superconductivity , thereby changing the vortex structure  @xcite .",
    "the spacing between the in - gap bound states is typically of the order of @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the gap amplitude , @xmath88 is the fermi energy . in the present situation ,",
    "the critical temperature of the real system is not proportional to the mean - field gap we are using  @xcite : it is dictated primarily by the coupling between the superconducting grains and therefor much smaller ( 200 mk ) than would otherwise appear from the gap values . in the tunneling spectrum ,",
    "the position of these in - gap bound states is thus not completely determined by the real t@xmath89 ( 200mk ) . however , while tuning the perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath15 ) or the gate - voltage ( _ i.e. _ , rashba soi strength @xmath35 ) , the abrupt transition from region ii to region iii , in fig.3(d)-(e ) , can also give rise to a stronger , unique experimental signature of majorana bound states .",
    "the topological excitations are , however , quite fragile against the imperfections of the host system .",
    "the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface contains intrinsic disorder such as oxygen vacancies , known to have significant effects on the interface electrons  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , imperative to study the robustness of the mbs against non - magnetic disorder , introduced through an onsite random potential @xmath90 in the hamiltonian  ( [ hbdg ] ) by @xmath91 , where , @xmath92 $ ] uniformly . in fig .",
    "[ dis ] , we plot the density of states @xmath93 $ ] for disorder realizations of various disorder strength @xmath94 .",
    "the mbs is quickly destroyed as disorder increases and other in - gap excitations appear within the bulk gap due to the defects .",
    "the mbs is , in fact , not expected to be robust against perturbations like disorder in this system since the time - reversal symmetry is already broken explicitly  @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ dis ] , the vulnerability of the zero - energy mbs is worse in presence of larger magnetic fields . in other words ,",
    "the mbs survives against larger strength of disorder when @xmath15 is smaller ( provided , @xmath15 should always be greater than the critical value @xmath45 to ensure topological regime ) . in the present system ,",
    "the degree of vulnerability is severe due to the in - plane magnetization which , in reality , weakens the topological state .",
    "hence the low - energy excitations are destroyed even when there is a finite superconducting gap . in fig .",
    "[ dis ] , we show a situation where disorder of random strength ( up to @xmath94 ) is present at all sites . we also consider a diluted situation by putting disorder at some random sites .",
    "[ dis1](a ) describes how the low - energy in - gap excitations are affected as the disorder concentration ( @xmath95 ) is varied .",
    "we find that the results are not different qualitatively from that in fig .",
    "the zero - energy majorana excitation remains unaffected unless a defect potential appears exactly at the vortex - core and , as in fig .",
    "[ dis ] , new states appear within the bulk - gap . to check where these defect - induced states are localized , we plot , in fig .",
    "[ dis1 ] , the quasi - particle density and ldos spectra at a defect site .",
    "we find that , as reported previously  @xcite , the new in - gap states are actually located at the defect sites . therefore in the tunneling conductance measurement , getting an excitation at zero - energy does not necessarily confirm a majorana particle .",
    "one has to be very careful in disentangling the majorana fermion from defect induced states or andreev bound states  @xcite .",
    "for the experimental realization of topological superconductivity and mbs in the interface 2del , an external zeeman field @xmath15 is required .",
    "this can be achieved by mounting the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface on top of a ferromagnetic insulator whose spins are aligned to the @xmath10-direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ design ] .",
    "the two major obstacles towards a realization of the topological state however , are ( i ) the intrinsic in - plane magnetization and ( ii ) the intrinsic defects .    to stabilize the topological state , the effect of the in - plane magnetization can be partially offset by tuning the rsoi via the gate voltage . to reduce the laser - induced defects ( in pulsed laser deposition method ) and intrinsic disorder such as the oxygen vacancies ,",
    "molecular beam epitaxy techniques are used instead .",
    "ozone may be used as oxidant instead of oxygen during the annealing process as suggested by warusawithana _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) or point - contact spectroscopy may identify a single mbs at the vortex core .",
    "typical experimental resolution in the tunneling experiments is about 2@xmath33v and should be sufficient to identify the zero - bias peak of the majorana bs from the nearby excitations . though the mean - field gap is known to be a gross over - estimation , a rescaling of the gap in fig .",
    "[ vortex](c ) on to the experimentally observed gap , about 80  @xmath33v , gives a value of the resolution - limit about 13  @xmath33v , close to the experimental values ( @xmath96v ) observed  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the usual temperature range , in which the thermal fluctuation is small for the detection of the mbs , is less than 100 mk  @xcite which is far below the curie temperature ( 200 mk ) of this interface superconductivity .",
    "recently , it has been shown that superconductivity is possible in quasi-1d structures , grown at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface  @xcite and may support majorana zero modes at the ends of such quantum wires  @xcite .",
    "these are the steps towards developing qubits , using this interface , which is to be used as the building blocks of a topological quantum simulator .",
    "in summary , we have shown that topological superconductivity hosting majorana fermions can be realized in the two - dimensional metallic interface of laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 under the right conditions .",
    "the phase diagrams show that an additional zeeman field with large rsoi is required to achieve a stable topological superconductivity .",
    "however , non - magnetic disorder such as oxygen vacancies are detrimental to the topological excitations .",
    "an experimental design likely to produce conditions conducive to observing majorana excitations is proposed .",
