    "in this work , we give a uniform description of the complete asymptotic statistics of the finite - time lyapunov exponent for a particle moving in a random time - dependent potential .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath7 characterizes the sensitivity of trajectories to small perturbations of the initial conditions and plays a fundamental role in the characterization of systems which display deterministic chaos @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is defined in the joint limits of vanishing initial perturbation and infinitely large times . in a hyperbolic hamiltonian system @xmath4",
    "may be obtained from any non - periodic trajectory , because for arbitrarily long times the trajectories uniformly explore the complete phase space .",
    "a widely studied generalization of @xmath4 is the finite - time lyapunov exponent @xcite , which is defined for finite stretches ( time interval @xmath0 ) of trajectories ( generalizations to finite perturbations also exist @xcite ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the dynamics to initial perturbations is given by the stability matrix map @xmath3 , which is the linearization of the map of initial coordinates to final coordinates . in terms of elements",
    "@xmath2 of @xmath3 , the ( complex ) finite - time lyapunov exponent may then be defined as @xmath8    in contrast to @xmath4 , @xmath1 is not a unique number independent of the initial conditions , but a fluctuating quantity with a distribution function @xmath5 ( defined by uniformly sampling all initial conditions in phase space ) .",
    "this distribution function determines , e.g. , the generalized entropy and dimension spectra of dynamical systems @xcite , and more practically the weak - localization correction to the conductance @xcite and the shot - noise suppression @xcite in mesoscopic systems .",
    "finite - time lyapunov exponents also determine the wavefront stability of acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation through a random medium , in the ray - acoustics / ray - optics regime of short wave lengths ( for a recent application see refs .",
    "moreover , they have shifted into the focus of attention due to recent advances in the understanding of the role of the lyapunov exponents for quantum - chaotic wave propagation @xcite : it has been observed that under certain conditions the lyapunov exponent can be extracted from the decay of the overlap of two wavefunctions which are propagated by two slightly different hamiltonians ( the so - called loschmidt echo ) . since the overlap is studied as a function of time , the distribution of the finite - time lyapunov exponent is directly relevant for these investigations .",
    "this extends also to related semiclassical time scales , like to the ehrenfest time @xmath9 , which is a semiclassical estimate of the diffraction time of wave packets due to the chaotic classical dynamics .    in the limit of infinite time @xmath0",
    "the distribution function @xmath5 in a completely chaotic phase space tends to the limiting form @xmath6 . for large but finite @xmath0",
    "the bulk of the distribution function can be approximated by a gaussian centered around @xmath4 , with the width vanishing @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "however , many of the properties determined by @xmath5 ( like the generalized entropy and dimension spectra ) can not be calculated from the gaussian bulk of the distribution function @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate for a particle moving in a one - dimensional random time - dependent potential how @xmath5 approaches the limiting distribution function @xmath6 for large times .",
    "our approach uniformly applies both to the bulk as well as to the far tail @xmath12 of the distribution function .",
    "we find that the cumulant - generating function of @xmath5 , @xmath13 ( where the average @xmath14 is over initial conditions and @xmath15 denotes the cumulants ) , takes the asymptotic form @xmath16 with @xmath17 a universal function ( within the statistical model ) and @xmath18 a system - specific time - scale which can be determined from the infinite - time - lyapunov exponent and the constant @xmath19 ( by definition , @xmath20 ) . the function @xmath17 is given by the leading eigenvalue of a second - order differential equation in which @xmath21 appears as a parameter .",

    "we find that these values are given by the leading eigenvalue of finite - dimensional matrices .",
    "a random time - dependent potential is often considered as a statistical model for the ergodic properties of hyperbolic chaotic motion , in the spirit of the early work of chirikov @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of the potential may be considered to mimic the dependence of the potential in the eigentime along the trajectory . in the context of finite - time lyapunov exponents",
    "there have been indications that a statistical description is usually valid for the chaotic background of its distribution @xcite , while system - specific deviations may exists in some exceptional cases even in the bulk of the distribution function @xcite .",
    "while the statistical model considered in this work is tailored to a specific class of hamiltonian systems , it can be modified straightforwardly to other classes of chaotic systems ( this is briefly described at the end of this paper ) .",
    "the problem of finite - time lyapunov exponents in the random time - dependent potential is equivalent to the problem of wave - localization in a random one - dimensional potential @xcite , because the equations of motion for the matrix elements @xmath2 are formally equivalent to the corresponding schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fokker - planck equation employed in this work is based on the phase formalism described , e.g. , in ref.@xcite .",
    "hence , the asymptotic statistics of the finite - time lyapunov exponent presented in this work directly is of interest and can be transferred to this field of research .",
    "a number of additional areas of application of our method come into scope if one considers the vast arena of problems which can be analyzed by products of random matrices , since the finite - time lyapunov exponents are a valuable way to characterize the eigenvalues of these products @xcite .",

    "it follows by direct computation that the first two moments of @xmath197 are identical to those of @xmath57 , @xmath200 these explicit results already suggest that the statistics of the two diagonal matrix elements is the same .",

    "the results for the cumulant - generating function @xmath203 ( hence also the growth rates of the moments , but not the transient behavior ) can also be transferred to the offdiagonal matrix elements of @xmath3 : the element @xmath51 fulfills the same differential equation as @xmath57 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : m11eq ] ) , while @xmath204 fulfills the same differential equation as @xmath197 .",
    "the initial conditions of the offdiagonal matrix elements differ from those of the diagonal elements .",
    "however , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumul ] ) this only affects the function @xmath205 in the subleading corrections of the cumulant - generating function [ which , for the example of the second moment , results in factors in front of the exponential functions which are different than in eq .",

    "in this work we presented a uniform approach to the asymptotic statistics of finite - time lyapunov exponents , for the model ( described in sec .  [ sec : form ] ) of a particle moving in a random time - dependent potential .",

    "( [ eq : eval ] ) .",
    "this facilitated an effective analysis of the statistics , including the non - gaussian deviations of the distribution function .",

    "( [ eq : gaussian ] ) .",
    "we limited our attention to the case of time - dependent hamiltonian systems with a single degree of freedom and a hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) which is of the special type of kinetic energy plus potential energy , with time - dependence only in the potential energy .",

    "the matrix @xmath39 in the differential equation ( [ eq : dm ] ) is purely off - diagonal , with fluctuations only in the lower - left element . for hamiltonians which do not separate into kinetic and potential energy , the differential equation ( [ eq : ham ] ) for @xmath3",

    "this situation appears to be related to the band - center case of one - dimensional localization in the anderson model @xcite ( where space is discretized on the lattice ) , since at the band - center the effective mass of the particle diverges ( and hence the mean of @xmath211 vanishes ) .",
    "\\b ) chaotic dynamics with an isotropic phase space may be modeled by independent fluctuations of all four matrix elements @xmath213 with identical amplitude and vanishing mean .",
    "hamiltonian dynamics gives rise to the further constraint @xmath214 .",
    "isotropic dynamics arises in typical chaotic maps ( some maps , like the baker map or the cat map , however , are not isotropic  the directions of stable and unstable manifolds are known by construction ) .",
    "good candidates are the poincar surface of section of autonomous systems with two degrees of freedom , in which the motion in four - dimensional phase space is restricted to three - dimensional manifolds of constant energy and the coordinate along the flow field is taken as a time",
    ".    it would be interesting to compare the outcome of an analysis of model b ) with the findings in the literature @xcite which indicate a certain degree of robustness ( if not universality ) of the distribution of finite - time lyapunov exponents for typical chaotic systems .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with philippe jacquod and holger kantz , and especially with steven tomsovic who motivated us to study this problem .",
    "the cumulants of order @xmath103 result from the recursion relations eq .",
    "( [ eq : recrels ] ) in the form of @xmath142-fold integrals .",
    "usually , the numerical evaluation of such integrals for large @xmath103 is very time - consuming , since the number of points on a grid covering the integration domain with lattice constant @xmath215 , @xmath216 , grows rapidly with @xmath103 as @xmath217 .",
    "however , presently the integrand factorizes and the expense of the integration can be reduced from exponential to algebraic @xmath103-dependence @xmath218 .",
    "the principle can be demonstrated for the example of the two - fold integral @xmath219 where @xmath152 is an arbitrary function and @xmath220 may itself be a multi - dimensional integral .",
    "we introduce an index @xmath28 which denotes that the argument of a function is taken at the @xmath28th lattice point on the appropriate axis of the grid .",
    "the initial values of @xmath221 at @xmath222 ( the lower integration boundary ) are zero .",
    "we now can write recursively , by incrementally increasing the integration variables ,      moreover , when @xmath220 itself is a multi - dimensional integral of type @xmath224 , its current value can be obtained recursively in the same way as the value of @xmath224 . since each additional integral will give rise to only one additional equation [ similar either to eq .",
