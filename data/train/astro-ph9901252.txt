    "at which @xmath0 has pointed at we have learnt something new and fundamentally important that was not discernable from ground based images , especially in the case of small dis .",
    "the small dis , like the dsph appear to exhibit a wide variety of sfhs .",
    "these results have affected our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution by demonstrating the importance of episodic star formation in nearby low mass galaxies .",
    "the larger galaxies in the lg have evidence of sizeable old halos , which appear to represent the majority of star formation in the lg by mass , although the problems distinguishing between effects of age and metallicity in a cmd result in a degree of uncertainty in the exact age distribution in these halos .",
    "it is important that detailed comparative studies of all galaxies in the lg are made in the future , including the m  31 and m  33 halo populations , to obtain a picture of the fossil record of star formation in galaxies of various types and sizes , and to identify both commonalities and differences in their sfh across the lg .",
    "in addition to a better understanding of galaxy evolution this will enable the comparison with cosmological surveys to be made more accurately .",
    "stellar evolution theory provides a number of clear predictions , based on relatively well understood physics , of features expected in cmds for different age and metallicity stellar populations ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "there are a number of clear indicators of varying star formation rates ( _ sfr _ ) at different times which can be combined to obtain a very accurate picture of the entire sfh of a galaxy .    _ main sequence turnoffs ( mstos ) _ :",
    "if we can obtain deep enough exposures of the resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies we can obtain the _ unambiguous age information that comes from the luminosity of mstos_. along the main sequence itself different age populations overlie each other completely making the interpretation of the main sequence luminosity function complex , especially for older populations .",
    "however the mstos do not overlap each other like this and hence provide the most direct , accurate information about the sfh of a galaxy .",
    "mstos can clearly distinguish between bursting star formation and quiescent star formation , ( _ e.g. _ hurley - keller _ et al .",

    "_ the red giant branch ( rgb ) _ : the rgb is a very bright evolved phase of stellar evolution , where the star is burning h in a shell around its he core . for a given metallicity",
    "the rgb red and blue limits are given by the young and old limits ( respectively ) of the stars populating it ( for ages @xmath11  gyr ) .",
    "as a stellar population ages the rgb moves to the red , for constant metallicity , the blue edge is determined by the age of the oldest stars .",
    "however increasing the metallicity of a stellar population will also produce exactly the same effect as aging , and also makes the rgb redder .",
    "this is the ( in)famous age - metallicity degeneracy problem .",
    "the result is that if there is metallicity evolution within a galaxy , it impossible to uniquely disentangle effects due to age and metallicity on the basis of the optical colours of the rgb alone .    0.5 cm    -0.5 cm    _ the red clump / horizontal branch ( rc / hb ) _ : red clump ( rc ) stars and their lower mass cousins , horizontal branch ( hb ) stars are core helium - burning stars , and their luminosity varies depending upon age , metallicity and mass loss ( caputo _ et al .",
    "the extent in luminosity of the rc can be used to estimate the age of the population that produced it ( caputo _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , as shown in the upper panel of figure  2 . the ratio , t@xmath2 / t@xmath3 , is a decreasing function of the age of the dominant stellar population in a galaxy , and the ratio of the numbers of stars in the rc , and the hb to the number of rgb is sensitive to the sfh of the galaxy ( tolstoy _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; han _ et al .",
    "thus , the higher the ratio , n(rc)/n(rgb ) , the younger the dominant stellar population in a galaxy , as shown in the lower panel of figure  2 .",
    "this age measure is _ independent of absolute magnitude and hence distance _ , and indeed these properties can be used to determine an accurate distance measure on the basis of the rc ( e.g. cole 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of a large hb population on the other hand ( high n(hb)/n(rgb ) or even n(hb)/n(ms ) , is caused by a predominantly much older ( @xmath410  gyr ) stellar population in a galaxy .",
    "the hb is the brightest indicator of very lowest mass ( hence oldest ) stellar populations in a galaxy .    _ the extended asymptotic giant branch ( eagb )",
    "_ : the temperature and colour of the eagb stars in a galaxy are determined by the age and metallicity of the population they represent ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "however there remain a number of uncertainties in the comparison between the models and the data ( gallart _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; lynds _ et al .",
    "it is very important that more work is done to enable a better calibration of these very bright indicators of past star formation events . in figure  3",
    "theoretical eagb isochrones ( bertelli _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) are overlaid on the hst cmd of a post - starburst bcd galaxy vii  zw403 , and we can see that a large population of eagb stars is a bright indicator of a past high _ sfr _ , and the luminosity spread depends upon metallicity and the age of the _ sfr_. that the rgb+agb population of vii  zw403 looks so similar to ngc  6822 ( gallart _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) is suggestive that di and bcd galaxies can easily transform into each other on very short time scales",
    ".    -7 cm -1 cm    -0.5 cm",
    "star - forming , di galaxies represent the largest fraction by number of galaxies in the lg , and it is clear from deep imaging surveys that this number count dominance appears to _ increase _ throughout the universe with lookback time ( ellis 1997 ) .",
    "the large numbers of `` faint blue galaxies '' ( fbg ) found in deep imaging - redshift surveys appear to be predominantly intermediate redshift ( @xmath5 , or a look - back time out to roughly half a hubble time ) , intrinsically _ small _ late type galaxies , undergoing strong bursts of star formation ( babul & ferguson 1996 ) .",
    "thus we can assume that the dis we see in the lg are a cosmologically important population of galaxies which can be used to trace the evolutionary changes in the _ sfr _ of the universe with redshift .",
    "the `` madau - diagram '' ( madau _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) uses the results of redshift surveys to plot the sfh of the universe against redshift .",
    "it predicts that most of the stars that have formed in the universe have done so at redshifts , _ z _ @xmath6 .",
    "if it is correct , then the mstos from the most active period of star formation in the universe will be easily visible as 7@xmath79  gyr old mstos in the galaxies of the lg ( e.g. rich 1998 ) .",
    "determining accurate sfhs for all the galaxies in the local universe using cmd analysis provides an alternate route to and thus check upon the madau - diagram .",
    "recent detailed cmds of several nearby galaxies and self - consistent grids of theoretical stellar evolution models have transformed our understanding of galactic sfhs .",
    "most of the di cmds to date suggest that the _ sfr _ was higher in the past , although the peak in the _ sfr _ has occured at relatively recent times as defined by madau - diagram ( the peaks occur at z=0.1@xmath70.2 , within the first bin ) .",
    "the mateo review of _ all _ lg dwarf galaxies ( mateo 1998 ) and studies of m31 and our galaxy ( renzini 1998 ) , on the other hand , suggest that the lg had its most significant peak in star formation @xmath410  gyr ago ( i.e at z  @xmath4  3 ) , the epoch of halo formation .",
    "many galaxies contain large numbers of rr  lyr variables ( or hb ) and/or globular clusters which can only come from a significant older population .",
    "it is possible that di galaxies have quite different sfhs to the more massive galaxies .",
    "thus although the small di galaxies in the lg have been having short , often intense , bursts of star formation in comparatively recent times this is not representative of the majority of the star formation in the lg .",
    "however direct observations of the details of the oldest star forming episodes in any galaxy are limited at best .",
    "this is an area where advanced cmd analysis techniques have been developed ( e.g. tolstoy & saha 1996 ) and telescopes with sufficient image quality exist and the required deep , high quality imaging are observations are waiting to be made .",
    "figure  4 summarizes what can currently be said about the sfh of the lg and how this compares with the madau _",
    "( 1998 ) and shanks _",
    "( 1998 ) redshift survey predictions .",
    "we have not included the dominant large galaxies in the lg , the galaxy and m  31 , but the sfh of the combined dwarfs is broadly consistent with what is known about the sfh of these large systems .",
    "they have , as far as we can tell , had a global _ sfr _ that has been gradually but steadily declining since their ( presumed ) formation epoch @xmath410  gyr ago .",
    "there is currently no evidence for a particular peak in _ sfr _ around 7@xmath79  gyr ago or any other time , as predicted by the madau - diagram for either large galaxies or dwarfs .",
    "the dominant population by mass in the lg dwarfs are de , if dis are singled out a population with a star formation peak in the madau - diagram range can be found .",
    "but at present the statistics are too limited to determine the typical fraction of old population in lg dis .",
    "there is clearly a total mismatch between the sfh of the lg and the results from the redshifts surveys .",
    "this might hint at serious incompleteness problems in high redshift galaxy surveys , which appear to miss passively evolving systems in favour of small bursting systems .",
    "the recent hst cmd results give much cause for optimism that we can hope to sort out in detail the sfh of all the different types of galaxies within in the lg if only hst would point at them occasionally .",
    "there is also great potential for ground based imaging using high quality imaging telescopes with large collecting areas , such as vlt is clearly going to be .",
