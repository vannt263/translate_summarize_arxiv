    "the classical smoluchowski coagulation equation is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the number density of clusters of size @xmath4 at time @xmath5 and it describes the formation of larger clusters by binary coagulation of smaller ones . the rate kernel @xmath6 is a nonnegative , symmetric function that contains all the information about the microscopic details of the coagulation process .",
    "for example , in @xcite smoluchowski derived the kernel @xmath7 for clusters that move according to brownian motion and merge if they come close to each other .",
    "various other kernels from different application areas can be found in the survey articles @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most kernels that one encounters in applications are homogeneous and we will assume this from now on .",
    "it is well - known that for kernels of homogeneity larger than one gelation occurs , that is the loss of mass at finite time , while for kernels of homogeneity smaller than or equal to one , solutions conserve the mass if it is initially finite .",
    "a topic of particular interest in this latter case is whether the large - time behaviour is described by self - similar solutions .",
    "while this issue is well - understood for the constant and the additive kernel @xcite , for other kernels only few results are available . in the case of kernels with homogeneity",
    "strictly smaller than one , existence results for self - similar solutions have been established for a large class of kernels @xcite , @xcite , while uniqueness and convergence to self - similar form has only recently been proved for some special cases @xcite , @xcite .      in this article",
    "we are going to consider kernels with homogeneity one .",
    "van dongen and ernst @xcite already noticed that one needs to distinguish two cases .",
    "in the first case , called class ii kernels in @xcite , one has @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "the most prominent example is the additive kernel @xmath10 , where it is possible to solve the equation with the laplace transform .",
    "in fact , for the additive kernel there exists a whole family of self - similar solutions with finite mass @xcite .",
    "one of them has exponential decay , the others decay like a power law in a way such that the second moment is infinite .",
    "recently , as the first mathematical result for non - solvable kernels with homogeneity one , existence of self - similar solutions for a range of class ii kernels has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , kernels that satisfy @xmath11 , are called class - i kernels in @xcite and we also sometimes call them _ diagonally dominant_. in this case it is known that self - similar solutions with finite mass can not exist , but a suitable change of variables reveals that one can expect that the long - time behaviour of solutions is similar as in the case of the inviscid burgers equation .",
    "to explain the idea it is useful to rewrite in conservative form , that is as @xmath12 then we make the change of variables @xmath13 such that becomes @xmath14 notice also that @xmath15 .",
    "hence , mass conserving solutions to correspond to nonnegative integrable solutions of with conserved @xmath16-norm .    as in @xcite , we consider the rescaled function @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , to understand the large - time behaviour of solutions to .",
    "we find @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "hence , we conclude that @xmath21 approximately solves the burgers equation .",
    "notice that in the second step in we have used the translation invariance of the integral which is specific to the property that the kernel has homogeneity one .",
    "recall that for integrable nonnegative data with mass @xmath22 the solutions to the burgers equation @xmath23 converge in the long - time limit to an @xmath24-wave with the same mass , i.e. @xmath25 with @xmath26}$ ] . on the other hand , if one starts with data such that @xmath27 as @xmath28 the solution converges to a traveling wave with height @xmath29 and speed related to @xmath29 .    in order to investigate ,",
    "whether the long - time behaviour of solutions to is indeed the same as for the burgers equation we performed in @xcite numerical simulations of for a family of kernels @xmath30 with a suitable normalization constant @xmath31 .",

    "one expects that the transition at the shock front is given by a rescaled traveling wave profile and simulations of for riemann data ( see figure [ fig : twaves ] ) indeed confirm that the traveling wave profiles are oscillatory for small @xmath32 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to establish the existence of such a traveling wave and compute details of its shape via formal matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "we will do this for kernels of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a small parameter .",

    "such solutions @xmath44 of correspond to special solutions @xmath45 of of the form @xmath46 , hence to traveling waves in the variable @xmath47 .",
    "we recall that for @xmath48 in we obtain the additive kernel , for which a whole family of mass conserving self - similar solutions exist . one of them with exponential decay in the self - similar variable @xmath49 , the other ones with power law decay @xmath50 as @xmath43 for @xmath51 @xcite . in the variables",
    "this means that @xmath52 as @xmath43 .",
    "we also have that @xmath42 as @xmath28 with the asymptotics @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , solutions to with diagonally dominant kernel must satisfy @xmath54 , hence , the integral of @xmath41 can not be finite .",
    "this is the reason that self - similar solutions with finite mass can not exist in this case .",
    "nevertheless , nonnegative solutions to in the case of diagonally dominant kernels are relevant as well , since we expect that they describe the long - time behaviour of solutions if one starts with riemann data in the variable @xmath38 , and they describe the transition at the shock front of the @xmath24-wave that appears if the initial data are integrable .",
    "notice also , that by varying the parameter @xmath29 , we can change the step height of the traveling wave . for the following analysis it is convenient to normalize @xmath55 .",
    "the numerical simulations on the other hand were carried out by normalizing @xmath41 such that @xmath56 as @xmath28 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to study how solutions @xmath41 to behave for kernels as in in the regime @xmath57 .",
    "we now describe in an informal way the main properties of the solution that we are going to construct .",
    "we try to obtain the solution essentially by a shooting argument starting at @xmath58 . in sections",
    "[ ss.minusinfty]-[ss.linearization ] we obtain that as @xmath28 a solution @xmath41 of is oscillatory with the asymptotics @xmath59 with @xmath60    the constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be chosen freely , while the function @xmath63 yields the contribution of the nonlinear terms induced by the term @xmath64 which are larger than the contribution due to the term @xmath65 as we will explain in detail in the end of section [ ss.linearization ] we can restrict ourselves , due to the translation invariance of , to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then still describes a two - dimensional manifold .",
    "it turns out that the solution that we are seeking lies close to the submanifold given by @xmath68 .",
    "the reason is that otherwise instabilities kick in , the solution becomes negative and is not a nonnegative solution of with the correct behaviour as @xmath43 .",
    "we remark here that our strategy is similar to our construction of self - similar solutions to the coagulation equation with kernel @xmath69 with @xmath70 in @xcite .",
    "also in this case the solution develops oscillations that become more extreme with smaller @xmath71 .",
    "however , the details are somewhat different and in particular , there we do not have the additional term @xmath72 in , but instead can do the shooting in a one - dimensional manifold .",
    "for simplicity of the argument assume for the moment that the terms with @xmath73 can be neglected and that we can use @xmath74 as a single shooting parameter .",
    "the main technical difficulty in the analysis of equation is to control the nonlocal integral terms .",
    "a key idea in our approach is that as long as @xmath75 we can approximate equation by a nonlinear ode system that is a perturbation of a lotka - volterra system , see section [ ss.lotkavolterra ] .",
    "we use an adiabatic approximation to compute the increase of an associated energy @xmath76 along the trajectories .",
    "this approximation is valid as along as @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath78 we enter what we call the intermediate regime , see section [ ss.intermediate ] .",
    "in this regime @xmath41 develops on intervals of length of order @xmath79 peaks of height one that can be approximately described by self - similar solutions to the coagulation equation with additive kernel , see section [ ss.kinetic ] .",
    "these peaks are connected by regions of length @xmath80 in which @xmath41 is of order @xmath81 . in the regime",
    "where @xmath41 is small we can again approximate by simple ode systems .",
    "still , we have to distinguish three different regimes that have to be coupled appropriately as described in sections [ ss.ode1]-[ss.ode2 ] .",
    "a key result in order to justify the approximation by odes is lemma [ l.gapprox ] in section [ ss.gapprox ] that allows to control , if @xmath41 is small and in a certain sense regular , the nonlocal terms by pointwise estimates .    for",
    "each @xmath67 we can construct in this way a solution to .",
    "however , in general they become negative . by a continuity argument , explained in section [ ss.shooting ] ,",
    "we show that there exists a parameter @xmath74 such that the corresponding solution satisfies @xmath82 as @xmath83 with the asymptotics as given in of lemma [ l.glargex ] .    in section [ s.fast ]",
    "we then address the additional parameter @xmath73 .",
    "we are going to show that @xmath73 must be very small and carefully chosen in order to obtain a nonnegative solution to that tends to zero as @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely , we consider the different regions explained above separately and show that if the term associated with @xmath73 becomes of a size comparable to the solution of the volterra - like problem , the corresponding solution will not be admissible as a solution to the coagulation equation .",
    "finally we emphasize that the construction of our solution is based on a matched asymptotic expansion .",
    "however , since we deal with an integral equation we can in general not use standard tools for asymptotic problems in odes , but have to estimate carefully the nonlocal terms corresponding to the integrals .",
    "as a first step we derive the asymptotics of a solution as @xmath28 . for this we note @xmath84 and it follows that @xmath85 .",

    "hence , we will call ( [ ode1])-([ident ] ) a volterra - like problem since the values of the functions @xmath105 and @xmath41 at @xmath38 depend only on the values of these functions for @xmath106    a solution of ( [ ode1])-([ident ] ) is however not necessarily a solution of .",

    "this suggests that some suitable shooting parameters need to be adjusted in order to obtain bounded solutions of ( [ ode1])-([ident ] ) .",

    "that case there are different possibilities . in some cases @xmath107 or @xmath104 change sign quickly , because the integral terms are irrelevant and the problem can be approximated by an integral equation .",
    "in other cases the solutions must be approximated by the solutions of the additive kernel ( the volterra - like problem ) discussed before .",
