    "when a femtosecond laser pulse with power above the critical for self - focusing propagates in air , a number of new physical effects are observed , such as long - range self - channeling @xcite , coherent and incoherent ghz and thz emission @xcite , asymmetric pulse shaping , super - broad spectra @xcite , polarization instability of linearly polarized pulse @xcite , polarization rotation @xcite , self - compression @xcite and others .",
    "a remarkable effect is also that in lidar experiments the light filaments propagate over distances up to 9 - 10 kilometers in vertical direction , preserving their spectrum and shape @xcite . in a typical experiment in the near zone ( up to @xmath1 @xmath2 from the source ) , when the initial pulse intensity exceeds @xmath3 , self - focusing and self - compressing start , which makes the @xmath4 spectrum broad band and asymmetric @xmath5 .",
    "the process increases the core intensity up to @xmath6 , where a short non - homogenous plasma column in the nonlinear focus is observed .",
    "usually the standard model describing the propagation in the near zone is a scalar spatio - temporal nonlinear paraxial equation including in addition terms with plasma ionization , higher order kerr terms , multiphoton ionization and others @xcite .",
    "the basic model works properly in the near zone because of the fact that the paraxial approximation is valid for pulses with narrow - band spectrum @xmath7 . at distances",
    "longer than 10 - 20 meters from the laser source , where the stable filament is formed , plasma generation and higher - order kerr terms are also included as necessary for the balance between the self - focussing and plasma defocussing and for obtaining long range self - channeling in gases . however , the above explanation of the filamentation is difficult to be applied at such distances .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , the plasma density at long distances from the source is too small to prevent self - focusing .",
    "there are basically three main characteristics which remain unchanged at these distances - the broad - band spectrum , the coherent ghz generation and the width of the core , while the intensity in a stable filament drops to a value of @xmath8 .",
    "the higher - order kerr terms for pulses with intensities of the order of @xmath9 are also too small to prevent self - focussing .",
    "the experiments , where observation of long - range self - channeling without ionization was realized @xcite , show the need to change the role of the plasma defocusing at such distances with another effect .",
    "in addition , there are difficulties with the physical interpretation of the coherent ghz radiation as a result of plasma generation .",
    "the light pulse near the nonlinear focus emits incoherent and _ non - homogenous _ plasma , while the coherent ghz radiation requires _ homogenous _ plasma with fixed electron density of the order of @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "only homogenous plasma can generate coherent ghz emission , but such kind of plasma is absent in the process of filamentation . in the real experiments with propagation of a single filament at distances more than @xmath12 @xmath2 from the source in air ,",
    "the following basic characteristics are found :    \\1 .",
    "broad - band spectrum ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "intensity of the order of @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "absence of plasma at long distances .",
    "asymmetric relatively stable ( lorentz ) spectral and longitudinal shapes .",
    "coherent ghz generation .",
    "recently in @xcite we developed a scalar ionization - free non - paraxial nonlinear model , which gives the above characteristics of the stable filament .",
    "the analytical and the numerical results describe correctly the linear and nonlinear evolution of narrow - band and broad - band laser pulses .",
    "in addition it was found that the equation has exact lorentz - type soliton solutions in approximation of neglecting the ghz oscillation .",
    "still , this theory can not resolve some difficulties .",
    "the main problems are :    \\1 .",
    "peak instability of the soliton solution under small initial perturbations .",
    "the soliton solution is obtained after neglecting the ghz oscillation .",
    "the soliton solution has one free parameter .",
    "there are problems with the conservation law of the nonlinear operator when we use the ghz oscillation .    to solve the above problems in this paper , we propose a nonlinear vector generalization to the model .",
    "the self - action process broadens the pulse spectrum - starting from a narrow - band pulse , the stable filament becomes broad - band far from the source . in recent papers @xcite it is shown that the evolution of broad - band pulses like filaments can be described correctly by useing the generalized nonlinear polarization    @xmath16    which includes additional processes associated with third harmonic generation ( thg ) .",
    "a more precise analysis presented in @xcite demonstrates that the polarization of the kind ( [ nlth ] ) is not applicable to a scalar model , because the corresponding manley - rowe ( mr ) conservation laws are not satisfied .",
    "that is why we investigate two - component electrical vector field .",
    "the generalized nonlinear polarization ( [ nlth ] ) is quite simple in terms of left - hand and right - hand circular components .",
    "let us now present the electric vector field of a pulse as a linear decomposition of left- and right - hand circular complex components .",
    "@xmath17    where the circular- polarization unit vectors are @xmath18 if we now represent @xmath19 in terms of its circular components as    @xmath20    we find that the components are given by    @xmath21",
    "the decomposition ( [ elf1 ] ) allows us to rewrite the nonlinear vector wave equation in the following system of equations .",

    "( [ am1 ] ) and ( [ am2 ] ) depend on the frequency difference and we can integrate over all values of @xmath46 . thus , we obtain the following system of amplitude equations in circular basis ( up to second order of the group velocity dispersion and zero order of the nonlinear dispersion ) .",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 is @xmath55 - @xmath56 laplace operator , and @xmath57 is a number , connected with the dispersion characteristics of the medium ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we note here that in gases the dispersion is weak and the series ( [ k2 ] ) are strongly converged up to single cycle regime ( broad - band pulses ) .",
    "thus , the non - paraxial system of equations ( [ syscirk1 ] ) describe correctly the evolution of laser pulses in gases up to a single cycle regime . it is important to mentoin that from eqs .",
    "( [ syscirk1 ] ) paraxial spatio - temporal approximation can be derived for narrow - band laser pulses @xcite only .",
    "the filamentation experiments demonstrate quite different pulse evolution : the initial laser pulse @xmath59 possesses a relatively narrow - band spectrum @xmath60 and during the process the initial self - focusing and self - compression the spectrum broadens significantly .",
    "the broad - band spectrum @xmath61 is one of the basic characteristics of the stable filament . that why we do not reduce more eqs .",
    "( [ syscirk1 ] ) and try to solve them for the case when the pulse has a large spectrum .",
    "another standard restriction in the filamentation theory is the use of one - component scalar approximation of the electrical field @xmath62 .",
    "this approximation , though , is in contradiction with recent experimental results , where rotation of the polarization vector is observed @xcite . for this reason in the present paper we use non - paraxial vector model in circular basis ( [ syscirk1 ] ) , in which the nonlinear effects are described by the nonlinear polarization components ( [ nlcirk ] ) . the dispersion number in air",
    "is very small : @xmath63 , so we can solve eqs .",
    "( [ syscirk1 ] ) in approximation up to the first order of dispersion .",
    "additionally , we will use the normalized amplitude functions @xmath64 to rewrite the system ( [ k2 ] ) in the form    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is a nonlinear coefficient .",

    "the corresponding longitudinal spatial carrier to envelope wave number is @xmath78 .",
    "detailed investigation on the evolution of the solution ( [ refield ] ) at distances more than @xmath79 meters from the initial point , reveals weak self - compression .",
    "that is why we consider the filament in this zone as closer to a weak rogue wave .",

    "the starting point of our investigation in this paper is the fact , that the generalized nonlinear polarization ( [ nlth ] ) arise new polarization state in circular basis .",
    "this polarization state leads to periodical exchange of energy between the electrical components @xmath86 and @xmath87 of a laser pulse . to derive the corresponding amplitude equations associated with this polarization , we take into account the orthogonality in the complex plane of the left - hand and right - hand circular components .",

    "our soliton solution is obtained for pulses which satisfy the additional condition @xmath88 .",
    "the diffraction of broad - band pulses is not the fresnel one @xcite , which leads to the conclusion that the soliton appears as a balance between semi - spherical ( fraunhofer type ) diffraction and nonlinear self - focusing .",
