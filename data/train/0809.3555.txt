    "the crystal used here is only slightly detwinned , i.e. , for 55% of the sample @xmath78 . at zero field @xmath79 shows a minimum at 200  k and a sharp increase at the lto@xmath44ltlo transition . for @xmath68 and @xmath69 the magneto - resistance at 7",
    "t is very small and barely visible in the @xmath80-dependent data .",
    "field loops @xmath81 at fixed temperature show a negative magneto - resistance of less than 1% at 7  t in the lto phase and a one order of magnitude smaller effect in the ltt phase ( not shown ) .    for @xmath55 a significant decrease of @xmath79",

    "furthermore , the field loops @xmath81 show the same type of sharp drop at @xmath65 as for @xmath82 and @xmath55 , just much smaller ( not shown ) . in the ltt phase the magneto - resistance",
    "is again extremely small .",
    "intuitively it is not obvious why , in the lto phase , the in - plane resistivity should decrease at a transition that effects how the spin sublattices are staggered along the @xmath1-axis , but leaves the in - plane spin structure unchanged .",
    "the first explanation that comes to mind is that , because of the extreme    anisotropy @xmath83 , a minor misalignment of the crystal or of the contacts caused an admixture of a @xmath1-axis component . since the crystal for @xmath77 was quite small we can not rule out this source of error . on the other hand , similar observations have been reported for the lto phase of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in recent theoretical studies the effect was ascribed to a less anisotropic localization length in the high field regime ( @xmath84 ) .  @xcite it was suggested that this results in a more 3d like variable - range - hopping , making more out - of - plane states available for @xmath30-plane transport .",
    "assuming this is true , it is clear from the present data that this channel and , thus , @xmath77 become independent of @xmath55 in the ltt phase , because as the spin - flip induced magneto - resistance of @xmath58 disappears , so does the associated change of the @xmath1-axis localization length .",
    "the magnetization measurements were performed on a bulky @xmath85  g single crystal .",
    "note that similar measurements on a @xmath86  crystal and on @xmath46  polycrystals have been discussed in ref .  .",
    "the present sample is our first lightly doped crystal and features very sharp transitions .",
    "the presentation of data will be limited to @xmath62 , since no significant effects have been observed for @xmath87 and fields up to 7  t , consistent with the absence of significant magnetic field effects in @xmath77 .",
    "figure  [ fig6](a ) presents the static susceptibility  @xmath88 for different @xmath62 .",
    "the van vleck susceptibility  @xmath89 of the europium ions provides by far the largest contribution ( solid line ) .",
    "figure  [ fig6](b ) shows the same data after subtraction of @xmath89 , which can now be compared to pure @xmath2 . for @xmath90  t a sharp nel peak at @xmath57 and a jump at @xmath35",
    "are observed .",
    "for @xmath91  t and higher fields the susceptibility  in the af ordered lto phase starts to increase significantly .",
    "the same behavior is observed in @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite in contrast , in the ltlo and ltt phases the susceptibility  is elevated at any field and shows almost no field dependence . at @xmath92",
    "t the susceptibility  increases monotonous with decreasing @xmath80 .    as is well documented , the nel peak is the fingerprint of a weak spin canting perpendicular to the @xmath5  planes , caused by dzyaloshinsky ",
    "moriya  ( dm ) superexchange .",
    "@xcite each plane carries a weak ferromagnetic moment ( wfm ) which orders antiparallel in adjacent layers for @xmath93 .",
    "when the external field @xmath55 exceeds the spin - flip field @xmath65 , needed to overcome the interlayer coupling @xmath94 , the spin lattice of every other layer rotates by @xmath95 , with the effect that the wfm of all planes become parallel to the field . as a result the susceptibility  in the lto phase increases . note that this is the reason why for @xmath96  t the peak does not represent @xmath57 , but the temperature below which @xmath97 and wfm start to order antiparallel .",
    "the changes across the lto@xmath53ltlo@xmath53ltt transition are also apparent in the magnetization curves @xmath28 . the data in figs .",
    "[ fig6](c ) and  [ fig6](d ) are after subtraction of the linear @xmath98 van vleck contribution . in the lto",
    "phase the spin - flip transition grows sharper and larger for @xmath93 .",
    "again , this is the normal behavior found in @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in contrast , below the structural transition no spin - flip transition is observed .",
    "the @xmath28 curves are close to being linear in the studied field range , indicating a significant change of the magnetic coupling between the planes .",
    "close to @xmath35 the magnetization at maximum field in the lto and ltt phase differs only slightly . the susceptibility  at 7  t in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) shows even better that there is no significant anomaly at the lto@xmath53ltlo@xmath53ltt transition .",
    "this implies that the wfm do not change their size across the transition , and at 7  tesla are ferromagnetically aligned in all three phases .",
    "there is a small number of interesting theoretical studies on this new magnetic state , motivated by experiments on @xmath99 .",
    "@xcite however , the static magnetization presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and in ref",
    ".   seems to escape these earlier calculations , in particular with respect to the structure dependence of the @xmath28 curves and the saturation field and moment of the wfm in the ltt phase .",
    "@xcite    figure  [ fig7 ] compares the resistivity drop @xmath100 with the moment change @xmath101 at the spin - flip transition . in the lto phase",
    "the data are qualitatively the same as for @xmath2 ,  @xcite whereas in the ltlo and ltt phase one can see the dramatic drop of these quantities . note that @xmath101 reflects the af coupled part of the wfm only .",
    "the total wfm , which also consists of a non - spin - flip part ( in particular in the ltt phase ) , continues to grow on cooling ( cf .",
    "fig .  22 in ref .  ) .",
    "[ dis ]    in several theoretical studies , motivated by the experiments on @xmath6  and @xmath9 , it was pointed out that the electronic transport between the @xmath5  planes does not depend on the direction of the weak ferromagnetic moments , but on the relative orientation @xmath102 of the spin @xmath103 sublattices in neighbor planes .  @xcite the apparent reason is that holes in an antiferromagnet prefer to hop between sublattices with same spin direction . as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for the lto phase , this implies that interlayer hopping at low fields ( @xmath104 ) takes place predominantly along the @xmath21-axis , whereas above the spin - flip field ( @xmath105 ) it takes place predominantly along the @xmath20-axis .",
    "the negative @xmath1-axis magneto - resistance then requires that , microscopically ( not measured ) , the interlayer hopping resistance along @xmath20 in the high - field regime is smaller than along @xmath21 in the low - field regime ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "an intuitive explanation for this is that @xmath107 , although the details are known to be more complicated .",
    "@xcite    in the ltt phase the situation is quite different ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the octahedral tilt axes have rotated by @xmath108 in adjacent layers . the magnetization measurements on @xmath46  presented here and in ref .  , as well as neutron diffraction experiments on @xmath109  in ref .",
    "show that , due to dm superexchange , spins follow the alternating rotation of the tilt axes .",
    "this means that spins are canted out - of - plane , but now form a non - collinear spin structure .",
    "both the tetragonal symmetry ( @xmath110 ) and the non - collinear spin structure ( @xmath111 ) cause a frustration of the interlayer superexchange , resulting in the absence of a well - defined spin - flip in the @xmath28 curves , see fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) . moreover , the two sketched ltt spin configurations with antiparallel ( left ) and parallel ( right ) alignment of the wfm are energetically nearly equivalent , and should both populate the ground state .",
    "@xcite    what are the consequences for the @xmath1-axis magneto - transport in the ltt phase ? because @xmath110 and @xmath111 , both interlayer hopping directions are structurally and magnetically equivalent .",
    "moreover , the application of a high magnetic field @xmath112 has no effect on @xmath102 , although it shifts the magnetic ground state towards the one in the right panel with parallel wfm .",
    "hence , the ltt phase is expected to be `` spin - valve '' inactive , consistent with the dramatic decrease of the magneto - resistance in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .    the remaining magneto - resistance of @xmath58 for @xmath55 and its field hysteresis at low temperatures , fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , still lack interpretation .",
    "it is unclear whether these features are intrinsic or due to structural imperfections of the ltt phase , resulting from a limited domain size and ltlo or lto like domain boundaries .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , these features seem to correspond with the hysteresis and remanent moment observed in the magnetization curves throughout the entire af ordered ltt phase of @xmath46  ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xcite    the ltlo phase , represented by the middle panels in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , is expected to show some intermediate behavior . in the temperature range @xmath113 , where this phase assumes 100% volume fraction ,",
    "it offers a unique opportunity to study the interlayer magneto - transport as a function of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "figure  [ fig9](a ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath114 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 , normalized to their values at @xmath35 .",
    "the correct way to compare these properties is after division by their values in the lto phase , extrapolated into the ltt phase ; see functions @xmath118 and @xmath119 . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig9](b ) .",
    "several scenarios are possible .",
    "if @xmath116 ( blue circles ) depends primarily on the spin orientation @xmath102 , then it should be proportional to @xmath120 ( red triangles ) .",
    "however , it is more likely that @xmath121 also depends on the orthorhombic strain , which produces the anisotropy of the interlayer hopping along @xmath20 and @xmath21 in first place , so that one may expect @xmath121 to be in first approximation proportional to @xmath122 ( black squares ) .",
    "the similarity between the temperature dependencies of @xmath116 and @xmath123 clearly shows that these quantities are connected . within the experimental error of the independent x - ray diffraction and",
    "magneto - resistance measurements it is , however , not possible to decide on the exponent @xmath124 . to isolate the effects of @xmath114 and @xmath102 on @xmath116",
    ", one could study the magneto - resistance in the lto phase under pressure .",
    "pressure is known to reduce the orthorhombic strain .",
    "what has been learned that may apply to the stripe ordered ltt phase of @xmath3 ?",
    "the stripe phase consists of spin stripes coupled antiphase across the charge stripes ( fig .  3 in ref .",
    "the stripe direction is parallel to the cu - o - cu bond but rotates by @xmath125 in adjacent planes , similar to the octahedral tilt axes . in zero field spins",
    "are parallel to the stripes , resulting in a non - collinear spin structure ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that for this type of system a large normal state @xmath1-axis magneto - resistance may not be observed for any field direction .",
    "first the tetragonal symmetry offers no advantage for any interlayer hopping direction .",
    "second in terms of the simple hopping picture often applied to the lightly doped compounds , i.e. , hole and spin swap sites , interlayer hopping in the stripe phase always creates frustrated spin moments between antiphase spin stripes .",
    "the application of a high magnetic field @xmath55 was shown to have no effect on the magnetic order .",
    "@xcite even if spin stripes carry a wfm due to dm superexchange ( which is still unknown ) the net wfm of each plane cancels out because of the phase shift by @xmath126 across charge stripes .",
    "hence , no spin - flip transition can be induced , ruling out a similarly strong @xmath1-axis magneto - resistance as in the af ordered lto phase of the lightly doped compounds .",
    "application of a high magnetic field parallel to the @xmath5planes produces a collinear spin structure , i.e. , spins within the stripes rotate until they are approximately perpendicular to the field .",
    "@xcite however the stripes themselves do not rotate .",
    "thus , even if slight lattice distortions due to , e.g. , the charge stripes would lift the structural frustration , the topology of the interlayer superexchange for a collinear spin configuration compares to a checkerboard pattern with @xmath127 and @xmath128 . as discussed in refs .",
    ", this indeed perfect magnetic and electronic decoupling of the planes seems responsible for the frustration of the interlayer josephson coupling and the concomitant loss of 3d superconducting phase coherence .    in summary ,",
    "the magneto - transport of lightly hole doped @xmath10  has been explored and linked to structural and magnetic properties .",
    "it was shown that the low temperature structural transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry and from collinear to non - collinear spin structure eliminates the spin - valve type contribution to the interlayer magneto - resistance . after calculating out spin orientation dependent effects by averaging high and low field data , the interlayer transport appears largely unaffected by the structural transition .",
    "in contrast , the transition triggers a significant increase of the in - plane charge carrier localization .",
    "the author thanks j. m. tranquada for fruitful discussions , and p. reutler and g. dhalenne for support during the crystal growth experiment at the laboratoire de physico - chimie de letat solide in orsay .",
    "the work at brookhaven was supported by the office of science , u.s .",
    "department of energy under contract no .",
    "de - ac02 - 98ch10886 .",
    "the @xmath28 curves in the ltt phase are still poorly understood .",
    "there is no sharp spin - flip , as well as no spontaneous weak ferromagnetism ( @xmath132  t ) .",
    "although in the low field regime @xmath133 is significantly larger than in the lto phase , which indicates that the af interlayer coupling is much weaker , it still takes very high fields ( @xmath134  t ) to ferromagnetically align all wfm .",
    "let us describe the af order of the lto phase as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 means wfm moment up and down .",
    "then , the zero field ground state of the ltt phase may possibly look like @xmath138 . there are random stacks with @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 of different length .",
    "the size of these domains is likely to vary also in the @xmath30 plane , and will most likely be smaller than in the lto phase ( due to the first order nature of the lto@xmath53ltlo transition ) .",
    "this may cause a broad distribution of local critical fields and , thus , smear out the spin - flip to a degree that the @xmath28 curves become effectively linear in a wide field range ."
