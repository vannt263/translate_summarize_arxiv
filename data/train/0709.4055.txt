    "the @xmath1-pair production at @xmath2 colliders plays a crucial role for testing the standard model of electroweak interactions . at lep2",
    "this process has been used for the determination of the @xmath1-boson mass @xmath3 , a fundamental parameter of the standard model , through @xmath1-boson reconstruction with an uncertainty of 40  mev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the triple gauge boson coupling as predicted by the non - abelian gauge theory has been verified within a few percent .",
    "the experimental study of the @xmath1-pair production at the international linear collider ( ilc ) is expected to improve the accuracy of the mass determination to 7  mev due to much higher luminosity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the advent of ilc will give access to the new high energy domain where the cross section is increasingly sensitive to the triple gauge boson coupling and @xmath1-pair production could be used as a probe of the non - abelian structure of the electroweak interactions and of possible gauge boson anomalous couplings . to match the experimental accuracy ,",
    "the theoretical analysis has to take into account the electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the cross section of the on - shell @xmath1-pair production have been evaluated by different groups @xcite already decades ago .",
    "the calculation of the one - loop corrections to the @xmath1-boson mediated @xmath4 processes has been performed in the double pole approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite and incorporated into the event generators yfsww @xcite and racoonww @xcite .",
    "recently the full analysis has been completed @xcite .",
    "these results ensure an accuracy significantly better than one percent when the characteristic energy @xmath5 of the process is about the gauge boson mass .",
    "however , once @xmath5 is far larger than @xmath3 , the cross section receives virtual corrections enhanced by powers of electroweak `` sudakov '' logarithm @xmath6 , which at the energies of about one tev have to be controlled to two loops in order to keep the theoretical error below one percent .",
    "this is even more valid for energies of 3 tev anticipated for the clic project @xcite . in the case of light fermion pair production",
    "these corrections are already available through the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( @xmath7 ) approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ including all the two - loop logarithmic terms @xcite . for @xmath8 production only the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) and the next - to - leading logarithms ( nll ) are known so far @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the analysis of @xmath1-pair production to the next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) approximation following the approach developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the four - fermion processes .",
    "the limit of the small - angle production , which could be interesting in the case of the transverse gauge bosons because the corresponding cross section is peaked in the forward direction , remains beyond the scope of the present paper . in the next section we outline the approach and derive the nnll corrections to the differential cross section of the gauge boson pair production in a spontaneously broken @xmath0 model which emulates the massive gauge boson sector of the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "we generalize the result to the @xmath9 gauge theory with a heavy top quark in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "a brief summary and conclusions are given in section  [ sum ] .",
    "let us consider as a toy model the spontaneously broken @xmath0 gauge theory with the higgs mechanism for gauge boson mass generation and with massless left - handed fermion doublets .",
    "the model retains the main features of the massive gauge boson sector of the standard model . in this case",
    "the result can be presented in a simple analytical form and constitutes the basis for the further extension to the full electroweak theory .",
    "we study the process of gauge boson pair production in fermion - antifermion annihilation at high energy and fixed angle when all the kinematical invariants are of the same order and far larger than the gauge boson mass , @xmath10 . in this limit",
    "the asymptotic energy dependence of the field amplitudes is dominated by _",
    "sudakov _ logarithms @xcite and governed by the evolution equations .",
    "the method of the evolution equations in the context of the electroweak corrections is described in detail for the fermion pair production in ref .",
    "the derivation of the evolution equations @xcite applies to any process of wide - angle production or scattering of on - shell particles when the characteristic momentum scale is far larger than the mass scale .",
    "it is entirely based on ( i ) the properties of hard momentum region and ( ii ) ultraviolet renormalization of the light - cone wilson loops .",
    "therefore it depends neither on specific infrared structure of the model nor on the specific choice of the external particles ( for the extension to the processes with arbitrary number of external particles see ref .",
    "thus , the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite directly extends to the gauge boson production as briefly described below .",
    "the only potential subtle point in the analysis of gauge boson production is that the effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking can change the asymptotic states as it happens with photon and z - boson in the standard model .",
    "this would require an additional consideration .",
