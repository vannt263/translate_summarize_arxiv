    "various schemes associated with quantum computing have been proposed for quantum information storage and transfers , such as superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators and dual waveguide devices  @xcite .",
    "a waveguide can be defined as a quantum wire in which the electron wave propagates in quantized modes without losing phase coherence at low temperature .",
    "various proposals have been suggested to implement a semiconductor qubit  @xcite . among these",
    ", an idea is to use parallel quantum waveguides with a coupling - window placed between them  @xcite .",
    "tuning the window - coupling allows an electron wave interference between the waveguides and can switch the electron motion from one waveguide to the other  @xcite .",
    "the interference in the coupling - region specifies the possible types of qubit - operations : the electron wave can be transferred through either waveguide only ( pass gate - operation ) .",
    "it can travel through both waveguides , split equally , implementing the so called square - root - of - not ( @xmath0 ) operation  @xcite .",
    "it can switch totally from one waveguide to the other ( not - operation )  @xcite . or it might switch from the first waveguide to the second one and then re - enter the first waveguide ( cnot - operation )  @xcite .",
    "there are several parameters and phenomena that can modify the efficiency of the kind of qubit - operation that are mentioned above such as external magnetic field , the coulomb interaction , electrostatic gate voltage , and the geometry of the coupling window between the waveguides .",
    "ferry s group proposed magnetically switching transport in an asymmetric double quantum waveguide , in which an external magnetic field is applied to switch electron motion from one quantum - waveguide to the other  @xcite .",
    "another suggestion for a switching - qubit is to vary the length of the coupling window ( cw ) @xmath1 . by varying the length of the cw",
    ", a maximum inter - waveguide tunneling can be found that increases the efficiency of the device  @xcite .",
    "another approach for a switching - qubit is to define a saddle potential in the coupling window instead of a hard - walled well potential .",
    "the saddle - potential makes a soft barrier between the two waveguides that washes out resonance peaks , but decreases the efficiency of the qubit  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider a double quantum waveguide ( dqw ) system with a cw between the waveguides in a static perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "both ends of the dqw are connected to semi - infinite leads with an applied source - drain bias .",
    "the coherent electron transport is investigated in the system by using a non - markovian master equation  @xcite .",
    "smooth gaussian potentials are used to define the barrier between the waveguides and the saddle - like cw potential .",
    "in addition , two dots are embedded in the waveguides close to the cw to enhance inter - waveguide transport .",
    "we will investigate coherent electron transport in the system by varying the cw length .",
    "our results reveal the following conclusions : first , we predict a maximum conductance at resonant energy - levels . at a resonance energy , inter - waveguide scattering is enhanced and the charge density splits equally between the waveguides in the absence of the coulomb interaction as two - electron states are activated in the transport . in this case",
    ", the dqw essentially works as a @xmath0-operation qubit . in the presence of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "the charge current density does not split equally between the waveguides anymore at the resonance since two - electron states are blocked for the bias range used .",
    "the strength of the blocking can be varied by the geometry or the material of the system .",
    "the transient transport through two capacitively coupled parallel quantum dots has been investigated by moldoveanu et al .  in a lattice model for a weaker coulomb interaction than is assumed here  @xcite .",
    "second , an external static magnetic field can increase inter - waveguide backward scattering leading to a decrease in the efficiency of the qubit .",
    "these results make clear the difference to previous schemes where variable magnetic field was used to control the switching between asymmetric waveguides  @xcite .",
    "third , the influence of the side quantum dots ( qds ) can be to induce more energy - levels into resonance , and consequently increase the coupling between the waveguides and the inter - waveguide transport mechanism . in the presence of side qds , a not - operation qubit is realized .",
    "the efficiency is slightly decreased in the presence of side qds because inter - waveguide backward scattering is enhanced . at high magnetic field",
    "such that the effective magnetic length is comparable to the radius of the dots , variation of length of the cw does not influence the electron transport characteristics anymore because the electrons are localized in the side dots .",
    "thus , the net charge current is extremely suppressed .",

    "this is important .",
    "the exact steady state takes a long time to reach due to a low rate of charging for 2 and 3 electron states .",
    "valuable time can be gained by operation of a device in the transition regime .    by tuning the length of the cw ,",
    "we have demonstrated two important physical characteristics of the waveguide system : resonant energy - levels and oscillations in the net charge current .",
    "the resonant energy levels indicate a strong coupling between the dqw and the oscillations denote that the resonance conditions are governed by the length of the cw .    in the case of an ideal non - coulomb - interacting window - coupled dqw system ,",
    "the charge current density splits equally between the waveguides at resonant energies , therefore , the net charge current reaches it s maximum value and the waveguide system works as a @xmath0-operation qubit . in the presence of strong magnetic field , the inter - waveguide backward scattering is enhanced , and the efficiency of the logic gate decreases .",
    "this inter - waveguide forward scattering at resonant levels without a magnetic field is not seen without including two - electrons states in the model .",
    "it is strongly reduced by the coulomb interaction that lifts the 2es out of the group of active states in the transport .",
    "this aspect can though be controlled by the exact system size and design as the coulomb blocking is reduced in a larger system , or by using a higher bias window or different material .",
    "our models only includes sequential tunneling of electrons from the leads to the system , but the addition of higher order tunneling would only increase the importance of the many - electron structure and the coulomb interaction on the operation of the system .    two parallel waveguides or dots can be coupled in many distinct ways .",

    "attain it capacitively , while zibold@xcite et al .",
    "fine tune the system by tunneling coupling .",
    "both groups stress the strong dependence of the device on its exact geometry and the structure and correlations of many - electron states that are active in the transport .",
    "our investigation with a different coupling scheme for the waveguides confirms this sensitive dependence .    in the presence of side qds ,",
    "more energy - levels of the two waveguides are brought into resonance which can lead to stronger coupling between them .",
    "effectively , the dots can increase the density of states around the resonant transport states .",
    "the electrons from the control - waveguide switch to the target - waveguide indicating a not - operation qubit .",
    "but on the other hand , the side - dots can also increase the inter - waveguide backward scattering and reduce the qubit efficiency . in a stronger external magnetic field ,",
    "the electrons get localized in the dots as the effective magnetic length is comparable to the radius of the side dot . in this case , the geometry of the cw does not affect the electron transport anymore .",
    "the external magnetic field here is considered static , but one more variable to influence the transport is the shape of the side qds in the waveguides . we show that the varying of the cw length between the waveguides can specify the type of the qubit logic gate to be implemented by the system .",
