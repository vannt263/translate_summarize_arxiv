    "regions at the centre of rich clusters where the hot t@xmath110@xmath2  k , thermal x - ray emitting gas is dense enough to cool radiatively within a hubble time are called cool - cores . cooling rates of the order of 10@xmath3  @xmath4  yr@xmath5 in the central few hundred kpc of the cluster have been estimated from x - ray imaging for this hot gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , x - ray spectroscopy implies that at most 10 per - cent of the x - ray emitting gas cools below one third of the virial temperature of a system , see @xcite for a review .",
    "the solution most often invoked in the literature is that some form of heating balances the radiative cooling of the x - ray gas .    at the heart of these cool - core clusters lie their brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) .",

    "detailed investigations show that the primary source of ionisation and heating of the cool gas must be local to the gas @xcite .",
    "this requirement combined with the observation that bcgs in cool - core clusters have significantly bluer colors in the ultraviolet ( uv ) to optical regime than their peers in non - cool - core clusters and in the field supports a young stellar origin for the ionizing photons ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "previous studies agree that the uv to optical emission is consistent with young stars @xcite .",
    "however , these studies suffer from poor spatial resolution , as the uv part of their datasets is based on observations with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) and galex .",
    "a number of recent papers , using high resolution fuv imaging with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , have shown that bcgs in cool - core clusters contain clumpy , asymmetric fuv emission on scales up to @xmath130  kpc from the nucleus @xcite .",

    "based on fuv morphology @xcite and @xcite argue that the fuv emission is due to young stars and that the clumpiness may be related to the absence of gas rotation on large scales @xcite . in this picture",
    "the fuv luminosities indicate a minimum star formation rate ( sfr ) of the order of 1 - 10  m@xmath7  yr@xmath5 in bcgs .",
    "deriving the true sfrs is highly dependent on very uncertain extinction corrections and as we will discuss below this uncertainty limits our interpretation of the observations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that fuv continuum and the ly@xmath0 emission cover the same area , with the fuv continuum emission being clumpier than the ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "they find evidence for significant dust extinction from the high h@xmath0/h@xmath8 ratios observed towards their bcgs .",
    "they also state that they find variations in the ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 ratio , which may be attributed to a non - uniform dust distribution .      here",

    "this paper has two main goals : ( 1 ) to establish the morphology of the fuv emission from two bcgs and compare it to the emission structures at other wavelengths ( 2 ) to establish the nature of the stars responsible for the fuv emission ( if indeed it arises from stars ) . for this second purpose",
    "we compare quantitatively the fuv emission with optical emission in other bands , particularly u - band . for this comparison",
    "there are two important intermediate steps : correction of the longer wavelength ( i.e. u - band ) fluxes for emission from the old stellar population of the galaxy , and correction of the u- and fuv- band fluxes for dust extinction .",
    "this last procedure in particular requires considerable discussion here .    for the above purposes we present in section 2 descriptions of the methods and reductions of our observations with the hst acs - sbc and the vlt fors , and of archival data : radio data from the vla and x - ray data from chandra . in section 3",

    "we discuss the star formation implied by the fuv emission and its relation to the ionised gas in these systems .    because the fuv / u ratio in the purely stellar scenario is uncomfortably large , in section 7",
    "we consider the possibility that some of this emission is from conventional non - stellar sources . finally in section 8",

    "this leads to the following possible explanations ; ( i )  there is little to no dust in front of the high fuv@xmath34/u@xmath34 areas and their emission is due to hot main - sequence stars .",
    "( ii )  the emission is due to exotic stars , such as wolf - rayet stars or white dwarfs , with temperatures above 50000  k. ( iii )  a non - stellar source contributes to the observed wavelength regime or alternatively this source affects the balmer decrement measurements .",

    "a clumpy , dusty medium , such as observed in a2597 and a2204 , may give rise to a selection effect in that we preferentially observe fuv emission coming from regions with low extinction along the line of sight .",
    "there are two ways in which this could arise , ( a ) the sightlines along these regions have intrinsically very low extinction , or ( b ) the balmer decrements trace the dust over a longer column than the observed fuv emission i.e. we only observe the fuv emission coming from the front part of the line of sight .    our optical spectra sample a small , but representative part of the fuv bright regions . here",
    "we can rule out option ( a ) because we do not observe any regions with low extinction .",
    "option ( b ) seems unlikely because the fuv to h@xmath0 ratio would vary significantly if background hii regions exist where high balmer decrements are observed but the fuv emission is highly extinguished .",

    "two dimensional integral field observations of the relation between h@xmath0/h@xmath8 versus fuv / h@xmath0 could clarify this issue .",
    "in the previous section we showed that very hot o - stars are able to explain to observed fuv and u emission . in this section",
    "we investigate whether these stars can power the ionised gas nebulae observed in h@xmath0 line emission and what the fuv and h@xmath0 implied star formation rates are .",

    "their analysis is similar to ours in that dust , the old stellar population and line emission is taken into account . for the dust correction they use the @xcite average mw extinction curve , which is similar to the c89 curve used by us ( see fig . 4 in c89 ) .",
    "their correction for the old stellar population is based on a template model derived from optical spectroscopy of the abell 4059 bcg and extending it into the uv .",
    "their main result is that they find that the excess blue emission in bcgs , even if they allow for reddening by dust , can be explained with star formation dominated by b5 stars i.e. @xmath115000  k. their results are based on the kurucz 1979 stellar models which are identical to the kurucz 1993 models used by us .",
    "considering an aperture with 7 arcsec radius centered on the a2597 bcg we compute the fuv@xmath44/u@xmath44 ratio from our data and correct it only for foreground mw dust .",
    "we then find fuv@xmath44/u@xmath44@xmath430.7 .",
    "this corresponds to a k93 stellar model temperature of 14000  k. this means that at low dust extinction we are in reasonable agreement with the cf93 result for a2597 .",
    "however , our results are no longer consistent with cf93 after correcting for the dust intrinsic to the bcg and the emission contributed by old stars .",
    "there are a number of reasons for this difference .",
    "first cf93 assume an extinction of a@xmath68=0.3 based on ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 results by @xcite .",
    "we use a@xmath68=1.3 based on optical spectroscopy of the balmer decrements .",
    "an additional magnitude of intrinsic extinction at visual wavelength as shown above has dramatic effects on the fuv / u ratio .",
    "we will discuss the extinction law in more detail below .",
    "the second important difference concerns the ratio of excess to total emission in the u - band .",
    "cf93 find that this ratio is 0.55 at 3500  @xmath19 , whereas we find that this ratio is 0.17 in the u - band ( 3600  @xmath19 ) .",

    "we have also computed the fuv@xmath34/u@xmath34 ratio by using the r and i band data , which should contain less excess emission as compared to the v - band .",
    "contamination due to line emission was set to 12 per - cent and 7 per - cent for the r and i band respectively . in these numbers",
    "we have included contamination due to the sii 6716  @xmath19 and 6731  @xmath19 lines that were not included in our spectra , but were measured by @xcite .",
    "we find no significant difference in the fuv@xmath33/u@xmath33 ratio when either the v , r or i band is used to remove the old stellar population , see fig .",
    "[ f_add_rat ] .",
    "we thus conclude the old stellar population in a2597 is different from the template used by cf93 .    a further uncertainty in the cf93 work concerns the large aperture mismatch between their optical and uv data which requires them to invoke large , uncertain , scaling factors that can affect their results .",
    "we also note that their 1600  @xmath19 fuv value for a2597 is about 25 per - cent larger than predicted by their b5 model value .",
    "the cf93 fuv 1600  @xmath19 value would thus allows for higher stellar temperatures than b5 as indicated by our result . taking into account the differences due the dust , old stellar population model and their fuv 1600  @xmath19 flux value then our results are in rough agreement with cf93 .",
    "cf93 discuss that the blue excess emission can be equivalently well described by a power - law f@xmath75 with @xmath0=[-0.5:0.5 ] .",

    "the reason for using this data set is because of the large wavelength coverage and thus being able to measure the balmer ratios under the same observing conditions and within the same slit observation .",
    "we have shown that these ratios can be described by an average mw type extinction law such as described by c89 , with an a@xmath501 - 2 , for a2597 and a2204 .",

    "star formation is usually accompanied by dust .",
    "thus if young stars are responsible for the observed excess emission then a significant amount of the total extinction should be associated with these stars , see also the discussion in section [ s_dust ] .    including mw type dust in our analysis of the excess emission in these bcgs has profound affects on the nature of this emission .",
    "if at least half of the dust is in front of the emitting regions , then stellar temperatures above 50000  k are required to explain the observed excess emission in the central 20  kpc regions of a2597 and a2204 .",

    "this indicates to us that both come from the same regions and are subject to the same extinction .",
    "another option to explain the observed ly  @xmath0/h@xmath0 ratio is that the shape of the extinction curve for the dust intrinsic to the bcg is different from the average mw curve .",
    "we experimented with a much flatter r=5.5 extinction curve , such as observed along the line of sight towards orion nebula ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the standard r=3.1 mw type extinction law , with c=0.56 i.e. assuming all dust is in front of the emitting regions , implies that the extinction in the fuv(1600  @xmath19 ) band is a factor 4 and 10 higher than in the u(3600  @xmath19 ) and h@xmath0(6563  @xmath19 ) bands respectively .",
    "however , a r=5.5 extinction law with the same amount of extinction ( i.e. c=0.56 ) would imply that the extinction for the fuv(1600  @xmath19 ) and u(3600  @xmath19 ) bands are practically the same and that the fuv(1600  @xmath19 ) would be a factor 2 more extincted than the h@xmath0 emission . lowering",
    "the relative extinction between the fuv and u band also means that it is possible to reconcile the observed excess emission with normal stars and that the range in allowed star formation rates decreases .",
    "finally it is well known that stars alone are not able to explain all the details of the emission spectra observed from bcgs in cool - core clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular the strong neutral atomic lines ( e.g. oi  6300  @xmath19 ) in combination with the weak high excitation lines ( e.g. oiii  5007  @xmath19 ) are a problem ( oonk et al . in prep . )",
    ". a strong source of heating with modest ionisation is required , but the details of this process are currently not understood .",
    "lyman and balmer line ratios are known to be affected by non - stellar heating processes such as strong shocks and agn @xcite .",
    "our bcgs are not dominated by either of these processes .",
    "alternative non - thermal models such low velocity shocks and/or heating by energetic particles have been proposed and may play a role@xcite .",
    "it is possible that these processes could also influences the line ratios , but this requires further investigation in the future .    a detailed investigation taking into account both the continuum and line emission over a broad wavelength regime is needed to investigate the shape of the extinction curve in bcgs and to clarify which of the above explanations for the lyman and balmer lines is appropriate .",
    "such an investigation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the bcgs in a2597 and a2204 are in many ways typical for the class of nearby ( z@xmath10.1 ) bcgs in massive cool - core clusters .",
    "they have blue fuv - optical colors , strong optical line emission and balmer decrements implying significant dust obscuration .",
    "the peak fluxes of the emission processes discussed here , i.e. x - ray , fuv , optical and radio emission , all agree and line up with the bcg nucleus . in both a2597 and a2204 the fuv morphology consists of a clumpy , filamentary part and a more diffuse part .",
    "each of these accounts for about half of the total fuv flux .",
    "the fuv morphology for a2597 differs from a2204 in that a2597 has a more spiral - like filamentary structure as opposed to the more radially extending filaments in a2204 .",
    "the total fuv to u emission ratio , i.e. prior to any corrections for emission contributed by old stars , peaks in fuv bright clumps and is indicative of very young star formation .",
    "correcting for emission contributed to the u - band by old stars shows that the old stellar component in a2597 is responsible for a larger part of the total u - band emission than is the case in a2204 . in neither object",
    "does the old stellar population contribute significantly to the total fuv emission .",
    "excess fuv and u - band emission is defined by correcting the total observed emission for the emission due to the underlying older stellar population . in both cases",
    "the location of the maximum amount of excess fuv and u - band emission corresponds with the bcg nucleus .",
    "the excess fuv to u emission ratio is found to be significantly higher in a2597 than in a2204 .",
    "it also has less spatial sub - structure in a2597 as compared to a2204 .",
    "the maximum ratio of the excess fuv to u emission is found to be located in off - nuclear regions in both objects . in a2204 this ratio peaks in the bright knots north and north - west of the nucleus . in a2597",
    "this ratio is high across most of the central region with small increases to the south and south - east of the nucleus .    interpreteting the excess fuv to u ratio in terms of main - sequence stars , taking into account only milky way foreground extinction",
    ", we find that we require stellar temperatures up to 40000  k for the bright knots in a2204 and up to the 50000  k for the central region in a2597 .",
    "correcting for emission contributed by the nebular continuum and/or additional extinction by dust intrinsic to the bcg means that the regions with highest ratio of excess fuv to u emission can no longer be explained by normal stars .",
    "contributions from non - thermal processes that have not been treated in this work should be investigated .",
    "using new , deep fuv imaging with hst and optical imaging and spectroscopy with fors on the vlt we present the first two dimensional analysis of the fuv - optical colors at 1 arcsec spatial resolution in the a2597 and a2204 bcgs .",
    "* we have mapped the fuv continuum emission with hst acs / sbc in the f150lp ( 1612  @xmath19 ) filter in 30@xmath2430  arcsec@xmath25 regions centered on the bcgs in a2597 and a2204 .",
    "the fuv continuum emission is distributed in clumpy , filamentary structures and is observed out to 20 kpc from the bcg nuclei . *",
    "the total fuv to u - band emission ratio shows that the a2597 and a2204 bcg have blue cores typical of bcgs in cool - core clusters .",
    "* the excess fuv and u emission , obtained by removing emission due to the old stellar population , is mapped at 1  arcsec resolution throughout the central @xmath120  kpc regions of the bcgs .",
    "the fuv and u excesses are shown to trace each other well on kpc - scales . * taking only milky way foreground extinction into account the excess fuv to u band emission ratio ranges between 0.6 - 3.0 in a2597 and 0.7 - 1.8 a2204 respectively . interpreting this in terms of k93 main - sequence stellar models",
    "we find that stellar temperatures between 10000  k and 50000  k in a2597 and 15000  k and 40000  k in a2204 are required to explain the observations .",
    "* most of the central 20  kpc regions in a2597 and a2204 have an excess fuv to u band ratio greater than 1 .",
    "this implies that the agn and non - thermal emission processes , such as synchrotron emission or bremsstrahlung can not account for the observations .",
    "* the morphology of the excess fuv and u band emission , as well the polarisation limits deduced for a2597 by @xcite , rule out scattering of light coming from the agn .",
    "stars thus remain as the most plausible explanation for the observed excess emission .",
    "* spectroscopy shows that the fuv and u - band emission observed by us for a2597 is not contaminated by line emission .",
    "recent claims of significant civ 1549  @xmath19 line emission in m87 are investigated and found not to be necessary in order to explain the observations . by extension of these results",
    "we believe that our fuv and u - band observations of a2204 are also free from line emission .",
    "* nebular continuum emission can account for up to 10 per - cent of the excess fuv flux and up to 40 per - cent of the u flux in a2597 and a2204 .",
    "correcting for the maximum amount of allowed nebular continuum means that most of the central 20  kpc excess emission in a2597 and the brightest excess knots in a2204 can no longer be explained by stars . *",
    "optical balmer line ratios indicate an average milky way extinction law with a@xmath65=1.3 for a2597 and a@xmath65=1.6 for a2204 . extending the extinction law to the fuv regime",
    "means that the observed fuv@xmath34/u@xmath34 ratio in the central 20  kpc regions of a2597 and a2204 can no longer be explained by k93 stellar models , if half or more of this dust is in front of the excess regions .",
    "* the fuv continuum emission matches the morphology of the extended h@xmath0 nebula in a2597 and a2204 on large scales .",
    "if the fuv emission is attributed to hot o - stars then these stars are able to account for the observed h@xmath0 emission in both systems .",
    "for a2597 this is in agreement with earlier results by @xcite . *",
    "the minimum star formation rate deduced from the fuv continuum is 3.5  m@xmath7  yr@xmath5 for a2597 and 10.2  m@xmath7  yr@xmath5 for a2204 .",
    "the maximum star formation rate depends strongly on the unknown dust distribution and extinction law . * assuming optically thin dust with milky way properties we estimate the gas and dust masses of the bcgs based on their measured a@xmath65 .",
    "we find m@xmath7910@xmath69  m@xmath7 and m@xmath8010@xmath31  m@xmath7 for the central 10@xmath2410  kpc@xmath25 regions in both a2597 and a2204 .",
    "this investigation shows that under special conditions on the nebular continuum emission and the dust obscuration it is possible to reconcile the fuv to optical colors with a stellar origin .",
    "the conditions are especially stringent for a2597 and in this regard contributions from non - thermal processes not treated here should be investigated in more detail .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the possible stellar origin for the individual knots observed at the intrinsic spatial resolution of hst requires further imaging with hst in line - free bands .",
    "also careful investigation into the dust properties and the shape of the extinction law will need to be carried out in order to resolve the uncertainties in determining the exact nature of the fuv to optical excess emission in bcgs .",
    "we note with interest that detailed observations of the morphology of the fuv continuum , the excess fuv to u band ratio as well as the properties of the cool t@xmath8110@xmath47  k gas in bcgs , do not imply a strong interaction with the central agn or its outflows on scales larger than the central few kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a minor merger or icm cooling scenario may be more appropriate to explain the extended 30  kpc - scale star formation , cool gas and dust properties in these objects .",
    "if the origin of the cool gas at the centres of bcgs is the ( residual ) cooling of the hot icm then the interaction between this hot gas and the agn outflows , thought to regulate the cooling process of this hot phase , may still be indirectly responsible for the observations at lower temperatures .",
