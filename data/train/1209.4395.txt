    "the interactions in quantum many - body systems are usually well approximated to be local .",
    "we say the ground state of the hamiltonian is _ unfrustrated _ or frustration free ( ff ) when it is also a common ground state of all of the local terms .",
    "there are many models such as the heisenberg ferromagnetic chain , aklt , parent hamiltonians of mps that are ff @xcite .",
    "besides such models and the mathematical convenience of working with ff systems , what is the significance of ff systems ?",
    "in particular , do ff systems describe systems that can be realized in nature ?",
    "some answers can be given .",
    "it has been proved by hastings @xcite that gapped hamiltonians can be approximated by ff hamiltonians if one allows for the range of interaction to be @xmath6 .",
    "further , it is believed that any type of gapped ground state is adequately described by a ff model @xcite .",
    "a nice feature of ff systems is that the ground state is stable against variation of the hamiltonian against perturbations @xmath7 as the kernels of the local terms remain invariant @xcite . in complexity theory , the classical sat problem was generalized by bravyi @xcite to the so called quantum sat or qsat .",
    "the statement of the qsat problem is : given a collection of @xmath8local projectors on @xmath9 qubits , is there a state @xmath10 that is annihilated by all the projectors ?",
    "namely , is the system ff ?",
    "lastly , an important physical motivation was given by verstraete et al @xcite where they showed that ground states of ff hamiltonians can be prepared by dissipation .",
    "previously , ref .",
    "@xcite focused on a chain of @xmath0dimensional spins with ` generic ' local hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "the local terms @xmath12 were chosen randomly with a fixed rank @xmath13 .",
    "three regimes were identified : ( i ) frustrated chains , @xmath14 , ( ii ) ff chains , @xmath15 , and ( iii ) ff chains with product ground states , @xmath16 .",
    "it was conjectured that the ground states of generic ff chains in the regime @xmath15 , with probability one , are _ all _ highly entangled in a schmidt rank sense .",
    "this regime however requires local dimension @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we extend the previous work to the case where the spins are on a tree .",
    "moreover , we improve on the previous results @xcite on a line by proving that there are no zero energy ground states when @xmath18 for qudit chains .",
    "we leave the problem of entanglement of the ground states open , though we believe the ideas presented herein ( e.g. , lemma [ columnranklemma-1 ] ) may ultimately , combined with techniques in @xcite , become helpful in proving lower bounds on the schmidt rank .",
    "consider @xmath19-child trees of @xmath20-dimensional quantum particles ( qudits ) with nearest neighbor interactions- at every vertex , @xmath19 edges fan out to connect to @xmath19 qudits as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - tree - structure ] . the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath21 is @xmath22local ; each @xmath23 , shown as edges in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - tree - structure ] , acts non - trivially only on two neighboring qudits .",
    "our goal is to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the quantum system , with generic local interactions , to be unfrustrated .",
    "namely , the conditions under which ground states of the hamiltonian are also common ground states of all @xmath23 .    by _",
    "generic _ we mean randomly sampled from any measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the haar measure . in this context , our notion of generic means that no particular local projector has a positive probability of being sampled . as discussed previously @xcite ,",
    "the question of existence of a common ground state of all the local terms is equivalent to asking the same question for an _ effective _ hamiltonian whose interaction terms are , @xmath24 with @xmath25 projecting onto the excited states of each original interaction term @xmath23 . when this modified system is unfrustrated , its ground state energy is zero ( all the terms are positive semi - definite ) .",
    "the unfrustrated ground state belongs to the intersection of the ground state subspaces of each @xmath23 and is annihilated by all the projector terms .",
    "we choose to focus on a class of hamiltonians for which each @xmath26 is a rank-@xmath13 projector acting on a @xmath27-dimensional hilbert space of two qudits , chosen by picking an orthonormal set of @xmath13 random vectors without translational invariance .",
    "the set of @xmath13 constraints of each local term can be seen as a @xmath28 matrix whose columns are the orthonormal vectors @xmath29 .",
    "this matrix is represented by a point on the steifel manifold @xcite .",
    "we now find conditions governing the existence of zero energy ground states ( from now on , called solutions in short ) .",
    "we do so by counting the number of solutions possible for a subset of the tree , and then adding another site and imposing the constraints given by the hamiltonian .    the tree structure with relevant indexing ]    below we use the extension of matrix product states ( mps ) representation @xcite to describe the state of the qudits on the tree ( also known as tensor product states ) @xcite .",
    "the structure of every tensor ( as in mps ) at a given site is @xmath30}$ ] , where the subscript @xmath31 indicates the connection with the parent and the subscripts @xmath32 indicate connections with the @xmath19 children of that parent .",
    "we denote the membership among the @xmath19-edges by putting the corresponding label ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) in parenthesis as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - tree - structure ] . the value of @xmath9 in what follows _ increases _ as we work our way _ up _ from the leaves to the root .    for a given @xmath9",
    "we will focus on a subtree rooted at some node @xmath34 on the @xmath35 level of the tree ; a distance @xmath36 from the leaves .",
    "we will solve for @xmath37 which represent all of the linearly independent unfrustrated solutions on the entire subtree rooted at @xmath34 .",
    "we will assume inductively that we have enumerated all of the linearly independent solutions @xmath38 on subtrees at the @xmath39 level for @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : the - tree - structure ] ) .    by definition the values @xmath41}$ ] give the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath37    @xmath42 and independent bases for each subtree .    in order to solve for the unfrustration condition and the degeneracy of the ground states on the subtree rooted at @xmath34 we must apply the constraints associated to the projectors between @xmath34 and each of its children . for a given child @xmath43 of @xmath34 it follows from the unfrustration condition that @xmath37 must be annihilated by ( see the corresponding edge in figure )    @xmath44 where    @xmath45 here @xmath46 is a set of random orthonormal vectors drawn from the @xmath27 dimensional space spanned by @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , the unfrustration condition implies that @xmath37 is annihilated by each one of the rank-@xmath48 projectors ,    @xmath49 for every @xmath50 . using    latexmath:[\\ ] ]    now , evaluating the eq . at @xmath289 , and where @xmath56 is specified by @xmath290 and @xmath291 the constraints collapse to    @xmath292}=y_{p',l',\\gamma^{(1\\cdots k)},\\tau^{(j\\neq l)}}=0.\\ ] ] and so we are done .",
