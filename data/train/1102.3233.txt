    "quantum communication is the transmission of information via quantum states .",
    "such states can exhibit correlations which are far stronger than anything allowed by classical theory .",
    "these quantum correlations enable us to perform novel communication tasks , such as the teleportation of quantum states @xcite or the distribution of secret cryptographic keys through public channels @xcite . to support the transfer and storage of quantum information",
    ", our communication infrastructure must incorporate new quantum devices such as quantum repeaters , quantum teleportation systems , quantum memories , and , most generally , quantum channels .",
    "unfortunately , unavoidable imperfections in these devices can degrade the embedded quantum information . although we can deal with some degradation by employing classical postprocessing ,",
    "if the imperfections become too strong we can lose the quantum advantage altogether .",
    "thus , it is important to distinguish whether our communication devices are truly functioning in a quantum way .    given a quantum state as input , a classical device is one which uses a _ measure and prepare _ strategy ( see fig . [",
    "fig : benchmarking1]a ) .",
    "this strategy consists of a measurement on the state , storage or transmission of the measurement result classically , and preparation of a new output state based on this classical information .",
    "any device which can be shown to be inconsistent with this strategy is said to operate in the _",
    "quantum domain_. from this basic idea , we can develop benchmarks which tell us whether or not a device is in the quantum domain .",
    "for example , one approach is to use the fidelity as a figure of merit .",
    "if the fidelity between the output state and the input state , averaged over some ensemble of test states , is higher than the best fidelity achievable by a measure and prepare strategy , then the device is in the quantum domain .",
    "unfortunately , this approach has some practical drawbacks . to calculate the fidelity accurately ,",
    "we need to either perform ( experimentally costly ) full tomography on the output states or make unverified assumptions about them ( e.g. , that they are gaussian ) .",
    "as well , the optimal classical fidelity must be found anew for each type of test ensemble , and it has only been found for a few cases @xcite . moreover , many of these fidelity benchmarks require testing with an infinite ensemble of states , which is not possible in experiment .",
    "another approach to the quantum benchmarking problem relies on witnessing entanglement , since measure and prepare channels are mathematically equivalent to the so - called _ entanglement breaking channels _",
    "if we verify that a channel or device preserves entanglement , when acting on a subsystem , then we also know that the device operates in the quantum domain .",
    "in fact , this can even be done with a minimum of experimental resources .",
    "for one , this approach does not actually require the use of entangled states ; instead , we can use ` effective ' entanglement @xcite .",
    "as well , only a few test states and a few different measurements suffice to witness entanglement .",
    "this experimental simplicity , without the need for unverified assumptions , makes entanglement - based benchmarks very practical .",
    "this approach is especially useful for testing optical devices with continuous degrees of freedom @xcite , where the fidelity - based techniques can not be easily used .",
    "entanglement - based benchmarks have already been designed which use two @xcite or more @xcite coherent test states , two squeezed test states , and even mixed test states @xcite",
    ".    these benchmarks ( fidelity- or entanglement - based ) do not give the full story so far .",
    "currently , they only address the simple question : _ quantum or classical ? _ there is a much richer realm of possibilities within the quantum domain",
    ". a device could be in the quantum domain , yet operate very inefficiently , consuming more resources than another device which performs the same task . to capture this difference in performance",
    ", we need quantitative extensions of existing benchmarks .",
    "such measures will enable us to characterize and compare different devices within the quantum domain . for entanglement - based benchmarks ,",
    "a natural extension is to consider _ how well _ devices preserve entanglement , by making use of entanglement measures .",
    "such an approach was recently studied in @xcite , calling this notion the _ quantum throughput_. this quantitative extension required no additional experimental resources beyond the ( already limited ) requirements of previous entanglement - based benchmarks .",
    "the results of @xcite are an important first step , but there remains much room for improvement .",
    "for one , the ` quantitative domain ' should be as faithful as possible with the quantum domain . in other words , if a device preserves the entanglement of some test state , then we should aim to give a non - trivial estimate of how much entanglement remains .",
    "we may not be able to estimate the amount exactly , but it is certainly non - zero .",
    "unfortunately , the methods from @xcite only give non - trivial estimates for a small fraction of the quantum domain ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : entbench ] ) , leading to overly stringent device requirements .",
    "clearly there is a need for more work on the theoretical side .",
    "additionally , @xcite considers only one type of benchmarking situation , involving two coherent test states .",
    "it is desirable to have quantitative extensions for many of the other entanglement - based benchmark schemes , and we need to develop new tools to handle these cases .    in this paper , we present a new method to quantitatively extend existing entanglement - based benchmarks for continuous variable optical devices .",
    "this new method is very successful , giving much stronger results than were previously achievable , often faithful over nearly all of the quantum domain .",
    "the method relies on projecting optical states to large finite subspaces and rigorously bounding the resulting truncation errors using homodyne measurement results .",
    "the strength of our approach can also be improved simply by devoting more computational resources to the task .",
    "the method is quite general and can be applied to many of the existing entanglement - based benchmarking situations , requiring no additional experimental resources .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entbench ] , we outline the main notions of entanglement - based benchmarking , both qualitative and quantitative . then , in sec . [",
    "sec : minent ] , we present our new method for calculating quantitative benchmarks .",
    "we apply our scheme to a variety of scenarios and report on the results in sec .",

    "we conclude the paper with sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , while detailing some proofs in appendices [ app : firstmomentbounds ] and [ app : secondmomentbounds ] .",
    "here , we briefly review some basic notions of entanglement - based benchmarking schemes .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the references for further details .",
    "these schemes are based around the fact that the set of measure and prepare channels is exactly the same as the set of entanglement breaking channels @xcite .",
    "if we represent a device by a superoperator @xmath0 , then it is entanglement breaking if the state @xmath1(\\rho)$ ] is separable _ for all @xmath2_. to disclude this behaviour , we must find a state which remains entangled after interaction with the device . to this end , consider the following entangled state : @xmath3,\\ ] ] where alice s subsystem is @xmath4-dimensional ( using the computational basis ) and bob s subsystem is an optical mode .",
    "the @xmath5 come from some fixed ensemble of nonorthgonal test states .",
    "the nonorthogonality of these states is encoded in alice s reduced density matrix:@xmath6 alice s subsystem is kept isolated , while bob s subsystem is sent through the device .",
    "this leads to the final state @xmath7\\left({\\left\\vert{\\psi^{ent}}\\right\\rangle { { \\hspace{-0.1 em}}}{{\\hspace{-0.1 em}}}{{\\hspace{-0.1 em}}}\\left\\langle{\\psi^{ent}}\\right\\vert}\\right).\\ ] ] since alice s subsystem was kept isolated , the reduced density matrix of this final state is still given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoa ] ) .    now , alice measures her subsystem using the projective measurement @xmath8 .",
    "when alice measures the state @xmath9 , bob s subsystem is projected , in general , into an infinite - dimensional mixed state @xmath10 we call these ` conditional states , ' since they are conditioned on alice s measurement outcome . bob measures the conditional states using a balanced homodyne detection setup .",
    "this allows him to determine the expectation values @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and variances @xmath13 of the canonical quadratures operators , @xmath14 this procedure is repeated many times to get useful measurement statistics for each of the conditional states .",
    "the goal is for alice and bob to verify the continued presence of entanglement in the final state @xmath15 . the given information ( homodyne measurement results and knowledge of @xmath16 ) turns out to be sufficient for this task .    in fact ,",
    "if we use a so - called ` prepare and measure ' scheme @xcite , it is not necessary to actually use an entangled state to test if a device is entanglement breaking .",
    "instead , we can use a classical mixture of the test states @xmath5 , and ask whether the device would have preserved entanglement if this mixture represented one subsystem of the entangled state eq .",
    "( [ eq : entstate ] ) .",
    "any device which produces such a classical mixture can be thought of this way ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : benchmarking2 ] ) .",
    "such entanglement is called _ effective entanglement _ , and this way of thinking offers a great experimental advantage .    to map out the quantum domain ,",
    "we need to paramaterize typical measurement results .",
    "for the quadratures , the action of any device on a test state can be described using the induced loss and noise . if the initial test states @xmath5 have means @xmath17 , @xmath18 and variances @xmath19 , @xmath20 , then the loss is parametrized by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and the excess noise is introduced through @xmath23 here , we assume that all conditional states exhibit the same loss and excess noise , and also that these quantities are symmetric with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this is done merely for simplicity of presentation , and the entanglement verification or quantification methods do not rely on this choice .",
    "one tool which has proved quite useful for the task of entanglement verification is the so - called expectation value matrix ( evm ) @xcite , which has been successfully used in all of the benchmarking scenarios mentioned above @xcite ( with suitable substitutions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : entstate ] ) ) .",
    "the evm method allows us to determine , for a given set of test states , which measurement results provide evidence that a device operates the quantum domain .",
    "an example result of the evm method is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qdomaincompare ] , for the case of testing with two coherent states @xmath26 .",
    "the main focus of this paper is in quantitative extensions to the above device testing scenario .",
    "the overall goal is to quantify how well an optical device preserves quantum correlations ( the quantum throughput ) by estimating the amount of entanglement , with respect to some measure @xmath27 , that remains in the output state @xmath15 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhodef ] )",
    ". we will develop the entanglement quantification method in general , but later use the negativity @xcite in concrete examples .",
    "the available information is the same as what is used for the qualitative benchmarking , namely homodyne measurements on the conditional states @xmath28 and knowledge of @xmath16 .",
    "since this information is tomographically incomplete , the best we can do is to give a lower bound on the entanglement , by minimizing over all states @xmath29 which have the same expectation values @xcite : @xmath30 the measurement operators @xmath31 may be something directly measured in experiment ( such as the quadratures ) or something more abstract ( such as projections onto pure states ) .    first results for this quantification problem were presented in @xcite .",
    "the underlying challenge is that the states in question are , in general , infinite - dimensional , making quantification inherently difficult .",
    "the basic strategy introduced to tackle this was to consider a projection of the infinite - dimensional mode subsystem down to a more manageable finite - dimensional subspace .",
    "this is more than just a practical simplification .",
    "it has been shown that , for any state @xmath15 , the presence of entanglement can be verified by searching within some finite subspace @xcite .",
    "in fact , for any entanglement measure with the strong monotonicity property , the entanglement content of the projected state gives a lower bound to the entanglement of the true state @xmath15 .    to see this ,",
    "let @xmath32 be a projector onto the desired mode subspace , and denote the ( unnormalized ) projected state by @xmath33 then we have ( with @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) @xmath36 for practical purposes , it is convenient to absorb the prefactor @xmath37 and work directly with the unnormalized states ( @xmath38 ) . as such",
    ", we restrict to entanglement measures which are well - defined for unnormalized states and where , for any @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 , @xmath41 in this case , we end up with the final inequality @xmath42 the above constraints must be kept in mind when choosing an entanglement measure .",
    "to go along with this projection , we must also relax the measurement constraints in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minent ] ) .",
    "importantly , even if we know an expectation value of @xmath15 exactly , we may not be able to determine the corresponding expectation value of @xmath43 exactly .",
    "however , we should try to constrain the expectation values of the projected state to be as close as possible to those of the state .",
    "if we understand the system well enough , we can bound how much the expectation values can vary , ideally restricting them to some convex set @xmath44 which depends on the known measurement results .",
    "if we can find such constraints , then we can perform a minimization over all projected states @xmath45 compatible with the known constraints about the actual @xmath43 ( and hence about @xmath46 : @xmath47    finally , by solving the optimization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : minentproj ] ) , we will arrive at a rigorous lower bound on the entanglement of the infinite - dimensional output state @xmath15 , @xmath48 to summarize , instead of finding the minimal entanglement over infinite - dimensional states with exactly known expectation values , we find the minimal entanglement over finite states with inexact expectation values .",
    "this latter minimization gives a lower bound to the former .",
    "any choice of projection requires us to find appropriate constraints on the expectation values , and the tighter the constraints we can find , the stronger the results will be .",
    "but what subspace should be projected onto ? in @xcite , which considered only the testing scenario involving two coherent states ( @xmath49 ) , the choice is made to project onto a two - qubit subspace , the smallest subspace which can show entanglement . in this case , the operators @xmath31 are projections onto the ` largest ' eigenvectors of the final mode states @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "constraints on these eigenvectors can be determined from the homodyne measurements using some bounds from the literature @xcite .",
    "a typical result of this approach is presented in fig . [",
    "fig : qdomaincompare ] .",
    "the quantum domain , found using the evm method , is shown in the same figure .",
    "although the two qubit projection works , it is clear that there are some drawbacks , since the quantitative domain does not come close to matching the quantum domain .",
    "first , by projecting into the smallest possible subspace , we may be cutting out important information . intuitively , we expect most information about our states to be confined to a small subspace , but a two - qubit subspace appears to be too small .",
    "second , the employed bounds are only tight for very low noise values ; this weakens the minimization at higher noise levels .",
    "finally , the bounds are applicable only to a specific two - qubit subspace , and not readily generalized to higher dimensions .    in the following section , we propose a modified version of this quantification scheme which proves to be much more successful .",
    "we still make use of the projection to a finite subspace , but we choose a different type of subspace which can have significantly larger dimension . for this",
    ", we will derive new , rigorous bounds which allow us to make much tighter approximations on our state .",
    "this new method does not require any additional information , and unlike the previous quantification scheme , is readily generalized to other benchmarking scenarios .",
    "perhaps the most natural choice of projection in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space of an optical mode is a projection onto the energy eigenstates , namely the fock states @xmath52 .",
    "intuitively , the larger the cutoff @xmath53 is , the closer the projected state @xmath43 should be to the full state @xmath15 , and for @xmath54 , the two states are the same .",
    "although we will use the finite projection trick of @xcite to find entanglement bounds , the projection onto fock states requires a much different set of tools for its analysis than the previously considered two - qubit projection .",
    "most importantly , we make the observation that it is not necessary to send @xmath53 to infinity .",
    "as long as the cutoff dimension @xmath53 is large compared to the mean photon number @xmath55 , a state and its projected form will be nearly identical .",
    "why is this so ?",
    "because high fock levels contribute more to the state s energy than low fock levels .",
    "if we know @xmath55 , we can put strong bounds on the contributions from high fock levels .",
    "we make this intuition concrete with the following lemma .",
    "_ fock cutoff lemma_. let @xmath56 be the state of a single optical mode , with mean photon number @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the ( unnormalized ) projection of @xmath56 up to the fock level @xmath59 , @xmath60 and denote the expectation value of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath61 by @xmath62 then the following inequality holds : @xmath63 _ proof : _ for @xmath64 , parametrize the diagonal entries of @xmath56 by @xmath65 the coefficients @xmath66 are positive , but otherwise unknown .",
    "we have @xmath67 and @xmath68 this leads to @xmath69 finally , note that this upper bound can actually be saturated , for example by the state @xmath70",
    "@xmath71    this lemma provides an upper bound on how different the trace of a state is from the trace of its projected form .",
    "since the mean photon number can be inferred from homodyne measurements , @xmath72 we can easily apply this lemma to the present benchmarking scenario . in this case , the quantity @xmath73 will be a free parameter which is a linear combination of diagonal elements from @xmath58 .",
    "it is only constrained by the obvious bounds @xmath74 . although it would be valid to replace the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : focklemmabound ] ) with the strictly numeric quantity @xmath75 , it is more useful to use the bound as is , since it links the constraints on @xmath76 and @xmath73 .",
    "most importantly , since @xmath55 is fixed , the bound can be made arbitrarily tight by increasing the cutoff @xmath53 .",
    "along the same lines , we can derive similar constraints ( also depending on @xmath55 and @xmath53 ) for all the other important expectation values .",
    "together , these constraints will form the basis of our new entanglement quantification method , outlined in the next subsection .",
    "for instance , if a state @xmath56 has some known values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then the expectation values of the same operators with respect to the truncated state @xmath58 can not be entirely arbitrary .",
    "in fact , if @xmath53 is large enough , the truncated state s quadratures have to be quite close to the infinite - dimensional state s quadratures . we can make this argument explicit with the following bound , involving the ladder operator @xmath77 : @xmath78 with @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the truncation of the state @xmath56 up to fock level @xmath81 .",
    "this constraint can be straightforwardly derived by expanding the annihilation operator in the fock basis and applying the triangle and cauchy - schwarz inequalities , as well as appealing to the positivity of @xmath56 .",
    "the full derivation can be found in appendix [ app : firstmomentbounds ] .",
    "although the quantity @xmath82 is not directly measureable , it can be found from the expectation values of the quadratures @xmath24 and @xmath25 with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "as well , the bound @xmath83 is not fixed , since it depends on other parameters",
    ". however , by the fock cutoff lemma , it has a maximum size @xmath84 thus , it is clear that the bound ( @xmath85 ) can also be made tighter by increasing @xmath53 . in practice",
