    ", we hope to provide further insight into these trends and to support research into the underlying physics which gives rise to them .    in section 2",
    "we discuss our program of observations , and in section 3 we present a brief review of our analysis method and new results for 25 swps , along with updated parameters for 5 previously analyzed systems . additionally , we report on hd202206 , which has been reported by udry et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to harbor a companion with a minimum mass of 17.5 m@xmath1 . in section 4",
    "we compare our findings both to similar spectroscopic studies and recently recalibrated photometric estimates , and examine several subsamples of swps and field stars with well - determined stellar parameters for potential trends in metallicity , galactic orbits , and stellar mass .",
    "we also offer interpretations of these results in light of current theories of planetary system evolution .",
    "we briefly summarize the main conclusions and discuss the implications of our results in section 5 .",
    "high - resolution , high s / n ratio spectra of 24 stars were obtained with the 2dcoude echelle spectrograph at the mcdonald observatory 2.7 m telescope using the same instrumental setup as described in paper v. an additional set of 7 southern stars were observed over two nights using the echelle spectrograph of the ctio 4 m blanco telescope . of these 31 targets ,",
    "25 were selected because they had been reported to harbor substellar companions ( see table 1 for details of the discovery papers ) , but had not been observed and analyzed by our group using the methods we have consistently employed on previously announced swps .",
    "these stars represented all of the known swps which were appropriate targets for our analysis , but which we had not studied as of the dates of observations .",
    "hd202206 was also included in this set , although its companion s minimum - mass estimate of 17.5 m@xmath1 suggests that it is more likely a brown dwarf than a planet .",
    "two stars , hd95128 and hd117176 , which had been previously analyzed in paper ii using spectra from the mcdonald observatory 2.1 m telescope and the sandiford cassegrain echelle , were observed again using the 2.7 m instrument combination .",
    "these repeat observations were made due both to the higher quality of spectra which could be obtained , as well as to increase the self - consistency of our swp sample .",
    "we also obtained new spectra of hd16141 , hd37124 , and hd  46375 , each of which we had previously analyzed in paper vi using keck spectra .",
    "the new spectra of these stars provides considerably expanded wavelength coverage , and allows us to employ our full atomic linelist in deriving results .",
    "several spectra of hot stars with high @xmath2 values were also obtained on each night in order to divide out telluric lines in the mcdonald and ctio spectra .",
    "table 1 presents additional details of the swps observations .",
    "we employed the same data reduction methods for echelle images as those detailed in paper v to produce one - dimensional spectra covering most of the visible spectrum .",
    "equivalent widths ( ews ) were measured for the same set of fe i and fe ii lines presented in paper vi ; the results are presented in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "ews were also measured for several additional elements , and those results will be reported in a subsequent paper .",
    "our method of determining the stellar parameters @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and [ fe / h ] is the same as that employed in our previous studies in this series , to which the reader is referred for more details . the results for our 31 program stars are given in table 4 .    since we have not previously used the ctio 4 m telescope for spectroscopic studies of swps , we need an independent check on the zero point of the derived [ fe / h ] values . a comparison of our ctio - based metallicity results with the spectroscopic studies of santos et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001a ) shows a mean offset of @xmath5[fe / h]@xmath6 , which is the same result we find in comparing our entire mcdonald - based swps sample to theirs .",
    "we therefore assume that the mcdonald 2.7 m and ctio 4 m spectra share a common zero point , and add no corrective offset to the ctio - based results .      in previous papers in this series we have primarily employed the stellar evolutionary isochrones of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and schaerer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , along with the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( esa 1997 ) and our spectroscopic @xmath0 estimates to determine masses , ages , and theoretical @xmath3 values .",
    "values are derived from theoretical stellar evolutionary isochrones at the age which agrees with the observed t@xmath7 , m@xmath8 , and [ fe / h ] values . ] in this work we have chosen to alter this method slightly by using the more recent padova isochrone set ( cf .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "2000 , salasnich et al .",
    "this was done in order to eliminate the offsets in @xmath0 and m@xmath8 that we had found necessary to reproduce solar values in the schaller and schaerer isochrone set ( see paper ii ) , and also in order to take advantage of the greater range of age , mass , and metallicity values covered by the padova isochrone set .    as before",
    ", we used our spectroscopic @xmath0 and _ hipparcos _ m@xmath8 values to determine a best fitting isochrone for [ fe / h ] values above and below the spectroscopic [ fe / h ] of the star in question .",
    "we then interpolated between these high- and low - metallicity isochrones to estimate values for each star s age , mass , and theoretical @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to performing this updated procedure on the 31 new spectroscopic results presented here , we re - analyzed all of the stars previously reported on in our swps series .",
    "this set of homogeneously derived evolutionary parameters for 58 swps is presented in table 5 , along with estimates of space velocities from _ hipparcos _ data , and additional age estimates based on the stellar activity index , @xmath9 .",
    "several of the stars in table 5 deserve note .",
    "due to its location in the h - r diagram , hd8574 presents two close but unique and equally viable solutions for its derived parameters , at [ mass ( m@xmath10 ) , age ( gyr ) , @xmath3 ] values of [ 1.16 , 4.4 , 4.20 ] or [ 1.11 , 5.6 , 4.18 ] .",
    "this degeneracy arises due to the overlap in this region of the h - r diagram of the main sequence and the post - main sequence blue `` hook '' of somewhat more massive stars .",
    "an additional four stars - hd6434 , hd37124 , hd46375 , and hd168746 - lie in regions of the h - r diagram which are too red and/or too luminous to be well fit by isochrones with appropriate metallicities and cosmologically reasonable ages .",
    "figure 1 presents h - r diagrams of these four stars along with padova isochrones of 14.1 , 15.8 and 17.8 gyr , selected to match as closely as possible our spectroscopic [ fe / h ] values for each star .",
    "note that hd6434 and hd168746 are significantly more metal - poor than stars which would lie precisely on the isochrones presented  isochrones of the same ages but with proper , lower metallicities would have higher temperatures and lie further to the left on these plots .",
    "in contrast to the extreme ages predicted by the padova isochrones , we note that while hd6434 has a space velocity suggestive of old age , the other three stars evidence relatively modest space motions , and furthermore three of the four possess @xmath9 values which indicate ages less than 5 gyr ( hd168746 has no published @xmath9 values ) . hd37124 and",
    "hd46375 have been previously identified as possible ` red stragglers ' in paper vi , and the very similar @xmath0 values we find in this work reinforce this claim .",
    "we have previously proposed that these stars might be overluminous due to the presence of unseen stellar companions ; however , a recent adaptive optics search for nearby stellar companions to swps by luhman and jayawardhana ( 2002 ) failed to detect any accompanying objects capable of producing the necessary luminosity enhancements for hd37124 or hd46375 . in light of these unusual and conflicting findings",
    ", we recommend that hd6434 and hd168746 also be examined for close stellar companions , and that all four of these ` red stragglers ' be targeted for follow - up studies to determine the source of their unorthodox characteristics .",
    "continuing efforts to characterize f , g , and k dwarfs in the solar neighborhood , as well as the considerable attention focused on the discovery and subsequent follow - up studies of swps themselves , have resulted in the development of multiple independently produced sets of spectroscopic and photometric estimates of basic stellar parameters for these objects . in the following subsections",
    "we compare our results to those of several recent studies .",
    "spectroscopic values of [ fe / h ] have been reported by santos et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001a , 2002 ) for most of the stars in the present study . in comparing [ fe / h ] values between the two sets ,",
    "we find a mean difference of [ fe / h]@xmath12[fe / h]@xmath13 , with a standard deviation of @xmath14 .",
    "this very close agreement is not a complete surprise , given the considerable similarity in the analysis method used by our group and that of santos et al . , but is nevertheless an encouraging indicator of the consistency and precision of our results .",
    "additional comparisons of our spectroscopic [ fe / h ] values for swps with those reported by several other investigators can be found in gonzalez ( 2003 ) .",
    "martell & laughlin ( 2002 ) and kotovena et al . ( 2002 ) offer newly calibrated equations for estimating metallicities from photometric data .",
    "the former utilizes strmgren indices to estimate [ fe / h ] , while the latter employ luminosities ( m@xmath8 ) andjohnson - cousins [ @xmath15 colors to determine [ fe / h ] and is specifically formulated for later spectral types ( 5.5 @xmath16 m@xmath8 @xmath16 7.3 ) .",
    "we used these to calculate photometric [ fe / h ] values for a set of 69 stars with substellar radial velocity ( rv ) companions for which previous spectroscopic metallicity results exist , using the kotoneva method for all stars with m@xmath8 @xmath17 5.50 , and the martell / laughlin equation for all brighter stars .",
    "we find a mean offset of [ fe / h]@xmath18[fe / h]@xmath19 , with a standard deviation of @xmath20 between the spectroscopic and photometric estimates .",
    "figure 2 shows the relation of this offset with @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and [ fe / h ] , which reveals no significant trend with any of these parameters .",
    "this suggests a zero - point shift in [ fe / h ] between the calibrating spectra of these photometric studies and the spectroscopic studies discussed here .      for an independent check on our @xmath3 and mass estimates , we turn to allende prieto & lambert ( 1999 , hereafter apl99 ) , who utilized the isochrones of bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and _ hipparcos _ data to generate estimates of mass and @xmath3 for just over 17,000 stars within 100 pc of the sun . of the 58 swps listed in table 5 ,",
    "53 are also included in the apl99 sample , allowing us to calculate tables of deviations between our two data sets and examine these differences for trends .",
    "we find that both our spectroscopic and theoretical estimates of @xmath3 compare favorably with those of apl99 , with the following mean offsets : @xmath21 ; @xmath22 .",
    "our mass estimates are also in very good agreement with apl99 , with a mean difference of m@xmath23m@xmath24 m@xmath10 .",
    "however , we do find a relationship between the deviations in mass estimates and [ fe / h ] , which we attribute to the exclusive use of solar metallicity isochrones by apl99 .",
    "we have derived the following second - order equation to correct for this : @xmath25 ^ 2 - 0.3023 [ fe / h ] - 0.0095\\ ] ] provided [ fe / h ] values from other sources are available ( e.g. from strmgren colors , as in martell & laughlin ( 2002 ) ) , this correction may be applied to the apl99 data to provide somewhat more accurate estimates of stellar mass .      a comparison of our values for @xmath0 with those of apl99 show a mean difference of @xmath26 k , with a standard error of 120 k , a reasonable match given the disparate methods employed and the lower precision of the temperatures reported in that work .",
    "similarly , spectroscopic estimates of @xmath0 available from the geneva extrasolar planet search programme website ( santos et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , santos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , perrier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) for 30 of the 31 stars analyzed here are also in close agreement , with a mean difference of @xmath27 k and a standard error of 55 k. for further comparisons of our temperature estimates with those of additional spectroscopic studies see gonzalez ( 2003 ) .",
    "independent age estimates based on @xmath9 values are available for 44 of the 58 stars listed in table 5 ( the remainder either lack published @xmath9 values or possess highly uncertain spectroscopic ages ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the deviations between our padova ages and those based on @xmath9 estimates as a function of @xmath0 , and we note a distinct trend of relatively lower @xmath9 age with increasing stellar temperature , in agreement with a systematic offset in @xmath9 age with spectral type previously noted amongst swps by barnes ( 2001 ) .",
    "although the @xmath28 values quoted in table 5 may not be representative of the true activity levels of the star in question ( as such reliability requires observations over several years to account for variability in stellar activity ) , it is unclear how such observational uncertainties could lead to the trends seen here and amongst the swps studied in barnes ( 2001 ) . a likely source of systematic offset between the two age estimates",
    "may be found in the different isochrone sets used ; the @xmath9 age calibration we employ is from donahue ( 1993 ) , which follows the method of soderblom et al .",
    "( 1991 ) who utilized the isochrones of maeder ( 1976 ) . in light of these points and",
    "those raised by many other studies ( c.f .",
    "donahue ( 1998 ) ) , the evidence we present strongly suggests a need to revise the @xmath9 age calibration .",
    "potential correlations between the metallicities and other physical characteristics of swps have been remarked upon since shortly after the discoveries of these systems ( c.f .",
    "paper i , marcy and butler ( 1997 ) ) , and more recent studies have pursued these possibilities as the sample of swps has grown ( paper vi , reid ( 2002 ) , santos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) .",
    "we continue this by examining several of these trends below in light of the new data presented , using a `` spectroscopic sample '' of swps constructed in the manner of and for the reasons described in paper vi .",
    "accordingly , it includes only swps for which we have derived spectroscopic [ fe / h ] values , along with 19 swps with parameters from santos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( owing to the similarity of our methods and results  see above ) .",
    "we further exclude all stars whose companions have a minimum mass greater than 11 m@xmath1 , as well as seven biased objects , specifically added to doppler search programs due to their high metallicities : bd -10 3166 , hd2039 , hd4203 , hd30177 , hd73526 , hd76700 , hd108874 .",
    "lastly , we have chosen to continue to include in our spectroscopic sample hd192263 , whose planetary companion has been challenged by henry et al .",
    "while we believe the evidence in that work to be compelling , the discovery team of hd192263 has not yet retracted its findings ; we will , however , make careful note of the presence of hd192263 in any figures or derived statistical quantities . in sum , these constraints yield a spectroscopic sample which contains a total of 71 swps .",
    "as first suggested in paper i , and later confirmed by a number of detailed studies ( c.f .",
    "paper vi , santos et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , reid ( 2002 ) ) , the current population of stars hosting radial velocity companions is metal - rich by @xmath29 dex in comparison to similarly selected samples of field stars not known to harbor planetary or brown - dwarf companions ( exact values of this offset vary slightly depending on the nature of the swps and control samples ) .",
    "the data presented here continue to support this now well - established feature of swps , with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath30 for our spectroscopic sample , compared with an average [ fe / h ] of @xmath31 for the stars - without - planets sample of santos et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "this latter sample shares the same zero point as the larger coralie sample presented in figure 3c of that work , and we compare the distribution of [ fe / h ] among our spectroscopic sample with the @xmath32 coralie stars in figure 4 .",
    "we do note , however , that while the mean [ fe / h ] for swps is still significantly higher than that of the general population of stars in the solar neighborhood , it is slightly lower than that of the spectroscopic sample studied in paper vi .",
    "this raises the possibility that as the nature of the planets detected by doppler searches evolves to include both less massive planets and systems with longer orbital periods , the metallicity distribution of swps may change as well .",
    "we illustrate this in figure 5 , which overplots histograms of metallicities from the 38 stars in the spectroscopic sample of paper vi with those of the 25 swps reported here ( the updated [ fe / h ] values for hd16141 , hd37124 , hd46375 , hd95128 , and hd117176 are incorporated into the paper vi histogram data ) .",
    "this may suggest a more subtle relationship between host star metallicity and the periods and/or masses of planetary companions  a possibility we will investigate further below  and is a development which should be monitored closely .",
    "in keeping with our analysis in paper vi , we have prepared a subsample of swps which , in addition to meeting the criteria for inclusion in the spectroscopic sample , have spectroscopic age estimates of less than 2.0 gyr .",
    "this sample is shown in figure 6 , where again in analogy with paper vi we plot [ fe / h ] against mean galactocentric distance , @xmath33 , relative to the position of the sun , @xmath34 , for both young swps and a sample of young field stars from edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ( hd192263 , which is young , but whose status as a swp is in question , is plotted separately as a square symbol ) .",
    "the dashed line is a least - squares fit to the sample of field stars , and we find that with the exception of hd130322 , all of the swps lie above this trend .    in a recent study of the galactic orbits of swps barbieri & gratton ( 2002 )",
    "find a similar result , in that at any galactic radius swps possess metallicities above the mean of nearby field stars .",
    "the authors suggest that this is best explained by a scenario in which the presence of companions is responsible for the observed high metallicities .",
    "although comparisons between our studies are not exact  our young swps sample does not have as large a range in [ fe / h ] values as the age - independent barbieri & gratton study , but suffers less from the effects of orbital diffusion  we do confirm this observational result .",
    "however , in contrast to barbieri & gratton we also find evidence of a difference in the slope of the metallicity - galactocentric radius relation between swps and the field star sample . because swps are so much more common among metal - rich stars , the trend with galactocentric radius",
    "is observed to be steeper than that amongst the field population .",
    "this could be interpreted as supporting a hypothesis in which the high metallicity is reponsible for the presence of companions .",
    "figures 7 and 8 present ( respectively ) the eccentricities and @xmath35 values of the planets in the spectroscopic sample , shown in each case as a function of host star metallicity ( for swps with more than one detected companion , the eccentricity of the innermost planet and the combined @xmath35 value of all planets in the system is adopted ) .",
    "in general agreement with santos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , no significant trend is visible for either distribution , although the upper envelope of each is observed to increase somewhat with higher values of host star [ fe / h ] .      as discussed at length in reid ( 2002 ) , santos et al .",
    "( 2001a , 2002 ) , and gonzalez ( 2003 ) , investigations of possible uniquely characteristic observational features of swps face the difficulty of the lack of a comprehensive , volume - limited control sample .",
    "we can mitigate this somewhat by strongly limiting the scope of our query , as in the case of the young swps ; however , in order to evaluate more global trends among swps , we require a more complete understanding of the stars being searched for rv companions .",
    "figure 4 approaches this goal with its comparison of the metallicities of swps to the coralie sample described in santos et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , but no additional data beyond the relative frequency of stars as a function of metallicity has been published to date on that control sample , rendering further inquiries into other physical characteristics difficult , if not impossible .",
    "mass is one important property of swps not yet examined in detail . in order to determine any potential trend in the masses of swps",
    ", we prepared a control sample from the list of 889 stars currently under observation by the california and carnegie planet search program ( ccpsp ) , for which accurate mean rv data has recently been published by nidever et al .",
    "this set of stars was selected because its detailed publication allows for further investigation of its member stars by additional methods , and its inherent inclusion of those swps found by the ccpsp enables ready comparison of those stars discovered to harbor rv companions with similarly studied stars which do not yet show such evidence .    from the initial data set of 889 stars we removed all stars with visual magnitudes fainter than 8.0 , the current stated limiting magnitude of the ccpsp , as well as all stars whose _ hipparcos _ parallax estimates possessed errors greater than 20% of their nominal value ( this latter restriction was made in order to insure the reliability of subsequent estimates of m@xmath8 ) . additionally , stars with m@xmath36 and @xmath37 were omitted , as were stars with m@xmath38 , in order to restrict the comparison sample to an f , g , and k dwarf subset .",
    "this process excluded several subgiant stars from the ccpsp subsample , but no members of the swps cohort .",
    "hd4203 , hd49674 , and hd108874 were also removed as they were added to the ccpsp solely due to their high values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "lastly , we removed an additional 9 stars for which no additional published spectroscopic or photometric data were available to provide estimates of [ fe / h ] . in total , this sample ( hereafter , the `` ccpsp subsample '' ) contains 496 stars , 36 of which have been reported by the ccpsp to host rv companions with minimum masses less than 11 m@xmath1 .",
    "we calculated values of [ fe / h ] for the ccpsp subsample using the previously described photometric recipes of martell & laughlin ( 2002 ) and kotoneva et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , employing the martell / laughlin equations for all stars brighter than m@xmath39 , and the kotoneva method for those dimmer . in keeping with our findings of an 0.10 dex offset between these photometric estimates and our spectroscopic results , we added 0.10 dex to the photometric [ fe / h ] values of all stars in the ccpsp subsample .",
    "figure 9 presents a histogram of the relative contribution of swps to the entire ccpsp subsample as a function of metallicity . as we have seen in similar analyses by other investigators ( santos et al .",
    "2001a , santos et al .",
    "2002 , reid 2002 ) , a significantly higher fraction of the metal - rich ccpsp subsample possess rv companions relative to the more metal - poor stars ( although the highest metallicity bin shown does suffer somewhat from low number statistics , as there are only 3 stars in the ccpsp subsample with such high values of [ fe / h ] ) .      in order to readily generate mass estimates for the ccpsp subsample",
    ", we performed a multiple linear regression analysis on the m@xmath8 , @xmath40 , and [ fe / h ] data points contained within a padova isochrone set with a fixed age of 3.98 gyr and [ fe / h ] values ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 dex .",
    "this yielded the following equation relating stellar mass , m@xmath8 , @xmath40 , and [ fe / h ] : @xmath43 + 0.216553 ( b - v)\\ ] ] we employed equation ( 2 ) on the full ccpsp subsample , and a comparison of the mass values thus generated with those calculated for the same swps using the padova isochrones shows a mean difference of m@xmath44m@xmath45 m@xmath10 , with a standard deviation of 0.09 m@xmath10 .",
    "the left panel of figure 10 presents a histogram distribution of the masses of the ccpsp subsample and the ccpsp swps , while the right panel presents the same information as a cumulative frequency distribution .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov analysis of the latter indicates only a @xmath46 probability that the two samples were drawn from the same population , suggesting the presence of a mass bias in the detection of swps amongst the full ccpsp subsample .",
    "there are many potential sources for such biases  for example , given the relatively high mean metallicity of swps and the tendency for more massive stars to be younger and therefore more metal - rich .",
    "it is plausible that there should be a bias favoring the detection of swps around more massive stars .",
    "however , the orbital velocity of a star harboring a companion is an inverse function of that star s mass , so that for any given companion mass , a more massive host star will be accelerated less by their mutual gravitational attraction , and thus will have a lower orbital velocity with an accordingly lower variability in its measured doppler signal .",
    "more precisely , the velocity amplitude goes as @xmath47 ( cumming et al . 1999 ) . additionally , more massive stars have fewer absorption lines and are more likely to possess higher rotational speeds , with both factors greatly reducing the probability of detecting the doppler signal from a companion ( bouchy et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "figure 11 attempts to address several of these possible concerns .",
    "each panel presents histograms of the relative contribution of ccpsp swps to the full ccpsp subsample as a function of mass ( solid line ) , as well as mean results from monte - carlo simulations ( dashed line ) with @xmath48 trial selections of ` pseudo - swps ' samples , each equal in size to the true ccpsp swps sample ( 36 stars ) . assuming a poisson distribution of error in bin membership for the true swps , the formal uncertainty in each bin is @xmath49 , while the standard deviations of the monte - carlo distributions are @xmath50 for all but the extreme upper and lower mass bins , which suffer from low numbers and have uncertainties of @xmath51 .",
    "panel ( a ) presents both distributions with no attempts to correct for any biases ; as expected , each bin in the monte - carlo distribution contains a @xmath52 percent ` pseudo - swps ' component , in accordance with the overall ratio of swps to the full ccpsp subsample , and the bias suggested by figure 10 is again evident .",
    "the remaining three panels of figure 11 consider corrections for possible biases . for panel ( b )",
    ", the true swps distribution is the same , but the monte - carlo selection process has been altered to force the ` pseudo - swps ' samples to mimic precisely the metallicity distribution observed amongst the true swps ( i.e. , the same number of stars in each metallicity bin ) .",
    "this eliminates from the simulated data those ccpsp stars below 0.7 m@xmath10 , whose metallicities are lower than any of the observed ccpsp swps , but also leads to a large overestimation of the contribution of the high mass stars as compared to the true swps distribution .",
    "this latter result argues strongly against high [ fe / h ] values as the sole bias in the observed mass function .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) attempt to address the previously mentioned biases against detecting swps around higher mass stars . in each case , and for both the observed and simulated data , we compensated for the radial velocity bias by applying a multiplicative correction of m@xmath53 to the frequency of swps ( or ` psuedo - swps ' ) in each mass bin , resulting in an increase in the relative contribution of stars greater than 1.0 m@xmath10 and a decrease in those below 1.0 m@xmath10 .",
    "we note that though this is theoretically precise , it is probably a somewhat overly strong correction for this effect , as the doppler signals of the observed swps have relatively high s / n .",
    "however , as we make no effort to compensate for the several additional biases presented against higher mass stars ( as they are difficult to directly and reliably quantify as functions of mass ) , we are confident that this correction as applied offers a reasonable resolution .",
    "panel ( c ) of figure 11 presents the mass - bias corrected distributions of both the simulated and observed data , while panel ( d ) considers both the mass - bias correction as well as the metallicity constraints as applied in panel ( b ) , and therefore represents our best estimate of the ` true ' mass function .",
    "evident immediately in all of the plots in figure 11 is a steep dropoff in the percentage of stars less than 1.0 m@xmath10 harboring known rv companions  only 6 swps have been detected from the 148 ccpsp subsample stars less massive than the sun , while 17 swps have been found amongst the 152 stars in the ccpsp subsample with masses between 1.0 and 1.1 m@xmath10 .",
    "the sharp downturns below 0.8 m@xmath10 and above 1.3 m@xmath10 are also suggestive , but as there are only 36 ccpsp stars in the mass bins at these extremes , even a high estimate of a 10% contribution by swps would predict only 1 or 2 swps at these masses . while we must emphasize that these suggestive results are only marginally statistically significant at this stage , if any of these trends are indicative of the true mass function of swps , they provide very strong constraints on models of planetary system formation and evolution , and impact profoundly the possible distribution of swps in the galaxy .",
    "gonzalez ( 2003 ) summarizes the three currently debated mechanisms for explaining the high [ fe / h ] seen among swps ",
    "the _ primordial _ , _ self - enrichment _ , and _ migration _ hypotheses .",
    "the trends seen above in the galactic orbits of swps would seem to support the findings of barbieri & gratton ( 2002 ) favoring the self - enrichment scenario , but the change in the slope of the metallicity - galactocentric distance relationship does suggest some dependence upon the value of [ fe / h ] , a prediction of the primordial hypothesis .",
    "the latter also finds support in the high metallicity of the subgiants hd27442 , hd38529 , and hd177830 , whose outer convection zones should be deep enough to effectively dilute any reasonable amount of self - enrichment . however , the addition here of several swps to the metal - poor subset with [ fe / h ] @xmath54 continues to provide a lower limit to any critical metallicity necessary for planet formation .",
    "figure 12 presents an analysis of our theoretical and spectroscopic @xmath3 values .",
    "this offers a possible insight into the self - enrichment scenario , given that a star with an enriched outer convection layer will have a more metal - poor interior than estimated spectroscopically .",
    "this results in a lower mass ( and therefore @xmath3 ) estimate than that given by evolutionary models for a star whose outer atmosphere shares the metal abundance of its interior ( ford et al .",
    "while this effect is small and difficult to reliably detect at the current level of resolution in the convection layer of 51peg , for example , would yield only an 0.05 dex offset in @xmath3 . ] , we note that our spectroscopic @xmath3 estimates are found to be on average higher than our theoretical@xmath3 estimates , in contradiction to this simple model .",
    "the possible trends with swps mass seen in figures 10 and 11 suggest the hypothesis that large , relatively close - orbiting planets may be preferentially found around more massive stars",
    ". however , some of this observed distribution of swps with stellar mass may be a reflection of the increased probability of finding swps orbiting stars with higher [ fe / h ] , as higher mass stars are on average younger , and therefore generally more metal - rich than lower mass stars .",
    "we explore this degeneracy in figure 13 , which presents [ fe / h ] as a function of mass for both the full ccpsp subsample and the subset of ccpsp swps .",
    "we note that the _ most _ metal - rich swps are found just above 1.0 m@xmath10 , not amongst the swps with the highest masses , and that there are large numbers of metal - rich , higher mass stars not in the swps subset .",
    "these points qualitatively argue against metallicity being the sole cause for the observed mass trend ; more thorough statistical examinations of the data set as it grows should be performed to properly determine the level to which these two stellar properties bias each other .",
    "if there is in fact a mass dependence on the likelihood of possessing a planetary companion , there are many potential avenues of inquiry to be explored  are massive stars perhaps more likely to suffer the effects of planetary migration via interactions with a more massive disk , or perhaps to directly form through disk instabilities giant planets in @xmath55 au orbits ? or are they simply more likely to form more massive , more easily detected planets , or perhaps more planets in general ? answers to these questions will most likely be found via continued searches for planets around stars of various masses , but with similar ages , metallicities , and environmental histories , such as the study of the hyades by cochran et al .",
    "the rapidly developing field of modelling planetary system formation may also yield insight into the underlying physical causes of the observed mass trend .",
    "given its potential to powerfully constrain theories of planetary system evolution as well as the overall distribution of swps in our galaxy , we strongly urge research groups to follow up on this preliminary and potentially critical finding .",
    "in this paper we have presented new spectroscopic analyses of 31 swps , including 25 swps which had not been previously examined in the context of our `` stars - with - planets '' series of papers . where overlap exists with other , similar research , we find very good agreement between our results on the basic stellar parameters of @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and [ fe / h ] .",
    "we further utilized our spectroscopic data and the padova isochrone set to derive ages , masses , and theoretical @xmath3 values for all of the swps examined in our series of papers .",
    "these data revealed a number of very interesting and unusual stars , including four `` red stragglers '' : hd6434 , hd37124 , hd46375 , and hd168746 .",
    "hd46375 is particularly unusual , in that it shows evidence of being both very old and very metal - rich .",
    "we recommend that these stars be the targets of detailed studies to determine the source(s ) of their abberant physical characteristics .",
    "when we combine the results here with that of our previous work and those of other very similar spectroscopic studies , we find a preponderance of evidence supporting the hypothesis that swps are preferentially metal - rich compared to control samples of field stars , as first proposed in paper i , and additionally confirmed by numerous research efforts ( paper vi , santos et al .",
    "2001a , santos et al .",
    "2002 , reid 2002 ) .",
    "this observed enhancement in [ fe / h ] over similar nearby stars is seen at all galactic radii amongst a subsample of young swps , a prediction of the _ self - enrichment _ model , but also appears to show some dependence on base metallicity , a feature of the _ primordial _ model ( and arguably the _ migration _ model as well ) .",
    "no strong evidence was found linking stellar [ fe / h ] to planetary characteristics , however , and a proposed test of the self - enrichment model via discrepancies in determinations of @xmath3 measured through direct spectroscopy and by application of stellar evolutionary models were found to be largely inconclusive . while it is almost certainly the case that there is some minimum primordial metallicity necessary for the formation of a planetary system , and that once formed any planetary system will almost certainly enrich its host star with metals , the degree to which either of these is responsible for the observed metal - rich nature of swps remains in question .",
    "pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and santos et al .",
    "( 2002 ) provide compelling evidence against widespread self - pollution as the source of the high mean metallicity of swps , while gratton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , murray & chaboyer ( 2002 ) , smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and laws & gonzalez ( 2001 ) offer similarly significant evidence supporting non - negligible levels of self - pollution .    finally , we used a multiple linear regression method and data from padova isochrones to estimate masses for 496 stars currently targeted for doppler studies by the california & carnegie planet search program , employing slight recalibrations to the recent photometric studies of martell & laughlin ( 2002 ) and kotoneva et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to derive necessary [ fe / h ] values . a comparison of this sample with the subset of known swps within this group demonstrated both the ( expected ) trend towards more frequent occurrence of swps amongst high metallicity stars , as well as a somewhat increased probability of detection of rv companions in orbit around more massive stars . while this last finding is highly tentative and marginal in its statistical significance , its ramifications are broad and deep",
    ". if our results are in fact indicative of the underlying mass function of swps , then this strongly constrains models of planetary system formation to prescriptions which preferentially populate stars of higher mass with planets typical of those being discovered by current doppler surveys . whether the deficit of giant planets around low mass stars is the result of a real physical effect or an artifact of the metallicity trend , the implications for the total number of swps in the galaxy are similar .",
    "given the fact that the overwhelming majority of stars in our galaxy are less massive than the sun , any tendency for such stars to be without large planetary companions has a profound impact on the total number of planets in our galaxy . were it to be the case , as suggested in wetherill ( 1994 ) that such large worlds are necessary for the development of intelligent life in a planetary system , then a lack of these giants around the most common stars in most galaxies may have important implications on estimates of the number of possible harbors of civilizations in the universe .",
