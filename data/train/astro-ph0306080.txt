    "classical novae ( cn ) are the result of unstable thermonuclear ignition of freshly accreted hydrogen and helium on a white dwarf ( wd ) in a mass transferring binary .",
    "the orbital periods of these binaries presently range from 1.4 to more than 16 hours , with a large number in the 2 - 4 hour range @xcite . these cataclysmic variables ( cvs ;",
    "@xcite ) have low - mass stellar companions and spend most of their lives accreting at time averaged rates , @xmath8 ( e.g.howell , nelson , & rappaport 2001 ) . the frequency of cn as a function of orbital period depends on the accumulated mass immediately prior to the explosion , @xmath2 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath2 strongly depends on the wd s core temperature , @xmath1 , which is _ a priori _ unknown and must either be calculated or measured .",
    "knowledge of the ignition mass is also needed for comparisons to measured ejected masses in cn that would decide whether or not the underlying carbon / oxygen wd is being excavated during the cn .",
    "cvs are formed when the wd made during a common envelope event finally comes into contact with its companion as a result of gravitational radiation losses over a few gyr ( e.g.  howell et al .",
    "the wd will have cooled during this time ; a @xmath9 he wd would have @xmath10 at 4 gyr @xcite , whereas a @xmath11 c / o wd would have @xmath12 in 4 gyr @xcite .",
    "these wds would have effective temperatures @xmath13 k. a subset of the cvs , called dwarf novae ( dn ) , contain a wd accreting at low time - averaged rates @xmath14 , where the accretion disk is subject to a thermal instability which causes it to rapidly transfer matter onto the wd ( at @xmath15 ) for roughly a week once every month to year .",
    "the @xmath16 onto the wd is low enough between outbursts that the uv emission is dominated by the internal luminosity of the wd , allowing for a measurement of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this is the best evidence that the wd is hotter than a cooling wd of similar age due to the thermal impact of accretion .",
    "@xcite has argued that most of this heating is from gravitational energy released ( i.e. converted to thermal energy ) in the wd interior via material compression .",
    "this energy is then transported outward to the stellar surface , and we find that it can similarly heat the core .",
    "we will discuss this in great detail , as well as explain the important role of nuclear `` simmering '' .",
    "a thorough comparison of our theoretical work to @xmath18 observations and a summary of the implications for cv evolution are in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "the gravitational energy released ( @xmath19 ) when a particle falls from a large distance to the stellar surface , sometimes termed the accretion energy , is deposited at , or near , the photosphere and is rapidly radiated away .",
    "this energy does not get taken into the star , as the time it takes the fluid to move inward is always much longer than the time it takes for heat to escape .",
    "this basically eliminates the outer boundary condition and instead points to the importance of energy released deep in the wd due to both gravitational energy released , via compression , within the star and hydrostatic nuclear burning . that energy takes a long time to exit , will still be visible when accretion has halted , sets @xmath18 , and reheats the wd .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : accenv ] by explaining the physics of heating within the accreted envelope and how that differs from heating in the deep core ( discussed in appendix a ) .",
    "since these wds are accreting at rates low enough so that the accumulated hydrogen burns unstably , we also need to carefully track the accumulated mass of material and account for the additional energy source of slow nuclear `` simmering '' near the base of the accreted layer .",
    "this is significant as the layer accumulates and eventually triggers the cn .",
    "the calculation of @xmath2 for a fixed @xmath1 is explained in  [ sec : ign ] ( closely comparing to the original fujimoto 1982 work ) , where we also exhibit the importance of the @xmath20 content in the accreting material .    our method of finding the equilibrium wd core temperature ( townsley & bildsten 2002 ) is explained in  [ sec : equil ] and improves on that of @xcite by allowing the accreted envelope mass to change through the cn cycle .",
    "we show that early in the cycle , when the mass of the newly accreted layer is small , compressional heating is small , and the wd cools . later in the cycle ,",
    "the accreted layer becomes thick enough that compressional heating along with nuclear simmering heats the core .",
    "so , the core cools at low accumulated masses and is heated prior to unstable ignition . using cn ignition conditions to determine the maximum mass of the overlying freshly accreted shell , we then find the steady - state ( i.e. cooling equals heating throughout the cn cycle ) core temperature , @xmath21 , as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath22 .",
    "we close  [ sec : equil ] by showing that for @xmath23 yr@xmath24 the wd reaches this equilibrium after accreting an amount of mass less than its own and that in cvs with @xmath25 hours the accretion rate changes slowly enough that the wd should always be near the equilibrium given by @xmath7 and @xmath22 .",
    "having found the core temperatures , we then predict the amount of mass that needs to accumulate on the wd in order to unstably ignite the accumulated hydrogen as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath22 .",
    "our work is compared to previous calculations in  [ sec : res ] , finding very large differences with others due to their lack of knowledge of @xmath1 .",
    "we also compare our predictions of @xmath2 to those few measures of the ejected masses in cn of known orbital period . within the confines of this limited comparison",
    ", we find that the ejected masses are comparable to the amount accumulated .",
    "the equilibrium also yields powerful relations between the wd surface temperature and its accretion rate and mass .",
    "these allow for tests of binary evolution models as well as measures of the masses of these wds ; a comparison to the accumulated observations of effective temperatures in the dn systems is being published separately @xcite .",
    "we close with a summary and discussion of future work , especially the seismology of these accreting wds .",
    "starting with @xcite single wd atmospheres are characterized by a relation between the surface luminosity , @xmath26 , and the core temperature , @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is one of two components ( the other being the thermal content of the core ) needed for evolutionary calculations of a cooling wd . in this case",
    "the atmosphere extends to the location where electron conduction forces the core to be isothermal .",
    "this occurs at @xmath27 for @xmath28 k and @xmath29 when @xmath30 ( see figure 1 in fontaine , brassard , & bergeron 2001 ) .    in an accreting wd ,",
    "energy is released in the atmosphere by the slow downward motion of matter in the gravitational field and by a slow rate of hydrogen fusion .",
    "this internal energy release modifies the @xmath26-@xmath1 relation , giving an accreting wd a higher @xmath26 than a non - accretor of the same @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath26-@xmath1 relation of non - accreting wds depends on the surface gravity , @xmath31 , which is set by the mass , @xmath22 , and on the composition of the envelope ( which fixes the opacity ) , typically split into layers of pure h and he .",
    "the wd mass enters in much the same way in the accreting case , but the composition also determines the local energy release in the envelope .",
    "we parameterize composition by the mass of the freshly accreted layer , @xmath32 , which has the composition of the donor star .",
    "we use a solar composition with mass fractions : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . since @xmath20 will prove important as an ignition trigger ( see discussion in ",
    "[ sec : ign ] ) at low @xmath7 , we will show models with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the lower and upper limits on expected values for the accreted material ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interior to this layer we assume a c / o core . as material is accreted at a time averaged rate @xmath7 , @xmath39 varies from zero ( immediately after a classical nova ) to some maximum , @xmath2 , just before ignition of the next classical nova .",
    "thus three parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath32 and @xmath7 lead to an @xmath26-@xmath1 relation .    due to the deposition of energy in the envelope ,",
    "the surface luminosity is not equal to the thermal energy lost by the degenerate core .",
    "however , the atmospheric model provides not only @xmath26 at the surface , but also the luminosity , @xmath40 , which enters the bottom of the atmosphere from the core .",
    "this luminosity couples the envelope model to the thermal content of the core , determining the temporal evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "as we will show , when @xmath1 is low , the envelope heats the degenerate core and @xmath41 .      as a spherical , gravitationally self - bound object accretes matter , it undergoes structural changes which we divide into two types : ( 1 ) global structural changes which affect the core radius , and ( 2 ) internal movements of material .",
    "see @xcite and appendix a for a discussion of the distinction between these terms . in the outer parts of the wd ,",
    "the two effects are largely decoupled ; material moves through the envelope and down into a deeper reservoir and the wd radius and the gravitional field in which the envelope exists are set by the total wd mass .",
    "this is particularly useful for the case of low @xmath7 , where the global changes happen extremely slowly , and can therefore be safely neglected .",
    "our treatment of the core is presented in appendix a , where we show that the energy release in the envelope dominates that in the core by a factor @xmath42 .    within a thin shell near the surface",
    ", accreted material enters at the top , and displaces pre - existing material which moves out of the shell , deeper into the star . with the assumption that the radius and total stellar mass , and thus @xmath31 , are fixed on the timescale being considered , the local heat equation becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the nuclear burning rate , @xmath45 is the entropy per gram , and @xmath46 is the downward speed of material motion in response to accretion . if a fluid element loses entropy as it is compressed , then that liberated energy is carried away by heat transport .",
    "the thermal structure of the envelope determines the two spatial derivatives and the nuclear energy input in equation ( [ eq : heateq ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath47 , the time evolution of the entropy field , depends on the current thermal structure and @xmath7 .",
    "a thermal structure for which @xmath48 is a static state for the envelope .",
    "if a higher @xmath7 were applied without changing the thermal structure , a local buildup of heat would occur , @xmath49 , due to the increase of @xmath50 without a change in @xmath51 .",
    "a lower @xmath7 leads to a corresponding cooling of the envelope .",
    "when the entropy advection term dominates over the nuclear burning term , this static state is stable because @xmath26 has a stronger temperature dependence than @xmath45 in both degenerate and nondegenerate regimes .",
    "however , when @xmath44 dominates over the advection a thermal instability is likely , leading to a classical nova explosion .    the radial derivative is evaluated from the envelope structure .",
    "we work in pressure coordinates , and define @xmath52 , so @xmath53\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the specific heat at constant pressure and @xmath55 .",
    "the entropy advection is given by how much the temperature gradient differs from the adiabat . in the static state",
    ", the gradient of the luminosity itself is then @xmath56 -\\frac{4\\pi r^2\\epsilon_n}{g}\\ , \\ ] ] which we use with the equations for heat transport and hydrostatic equilibrium to solve for both the structure and luminosity in the envelope , resulting in an @xmath26 and @xmath40 which depend on @xmath1 , @xmath22 , @xmath7 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath26 from accretion is the heat not advected with the material , and is referred to in the literature as `` compressional heating . ''",
    "though this choice of words is unfortunate since the action occurring is more like cooling , we use this common term in our discussions . in all the calculations presented here we use a fixed @xmath57 for the last term in equation ( [ dldp ] ) , that of a zero temperature wd , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 cm for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively . as a single point check , matching the bottom of the envelope and the outer edge of a finite - temperature core model yeilds @xmath64 cm for @xmath29 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . by dropping the nuclear burning term and making a few other simplifying assumptions equation ( [ dldp ] )",
    "can be integrated analytically to obtain an approximate luminosity , @xmath67 ( see appendix [ app : estimate ] ) , where @xmath68 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath69 is the proton mass and @xmath70 is the mean molecular weight of the freshly accreted envelope .",
    "since @xmath32 changes with time as @xmath71 , the static envelope structure is an approximation to the evolution . for this method to be accurate ,",
    "we want the neglected term to be small , namely @xmath72 .",
    "evaluating at a fixed pressure and using equation ( [ eq : tvdsdt ] ) gives @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the accretion time .",
    "dropping the temperature gradient ( good in the conductive regions ) , finite differencing and setting @xmath75 leads to the condition @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the temperature change at the envelope base during accumulation . as will be shown in section [ sec : equil ] , the evolution of @xmath32 takes place at constant @xmath1 , so that this condition is always satisfied and our static structures are an excellent approximation for the accumulating envelope .",
    "now we wish to consider the effect of the outer boundary condition on the structure of the envelope . to determine this we compare the thermal cooling time of an outer layer , @xmath78 to the time to accrete that layer @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 is the mass of the ( thin ) outer layer being considered , @xmath81 is the temperature of the layer , and @xmath26 is the overall luminosity which is driven mostly by energy released from deeper layers , @xmath82 .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath83 , so that where @xmath84 in the outer layers , the material can cool much more quickly than it is being accreted and therefore has no influence over the thermal structure of deeper layers . in other words ,",
    "the entropy of the outer envelope is determined by the luminosity flowing through it , rather than any external boundary condition . the condition @xmath85 is sometimes violated during a dwarf novae ( dn ) event , where either the high external radiation field @xcite or the more rapid accretion @xcite temporarily modifies the outermost layers of the wd envelope",
    "however , this heat does not penetrate to depths critical for the wd core , but only to a depth where the thermal time is of order the duration of the dn outburst , and is the likely cause of the fading @xmath18 seen following a dn outburst ( see sion s 1999 review ) .",
    "in addition to the downward motion due to accretion , the heavier helium ions will sink with respect to the overall flow .",
    "while we have not included this effect , we estimate here when it is important .",
    "the drift velocity of the he ions is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the thermal diffusion coefficient ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the downward velocity of the fluid due to accretion , @xmath88 . in the simplest approximation ,",
    "coulomb scattering off protons dominates and @xmath89 @xmath90 s@xmath24 @xcite , where @xmath91 k and @xmath92 g @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the coulomb logarithm . for @xmath95",
    "this yields the relationship @xmath96 , so that for our lowest accretion rate , @xmath97 yr@xmath24 , where @xmath98 , only the high mass models deserve further scrutiny .",
    "below this accretion rate , the energy release due to sedimentation of the helium in the accreted material can be a moderate fraction of that released due to compression . for our @xmath99 model with @xmath100 yr@xmath24 , the conditions at the base of the h / he layer when @xmath101 are @xmath102 g @xmath93 , @xmath103 k so that the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath104 .",
    "diffusion coefficients in this gas - liquid crossover regime have yet to be authoritatively calculated . using the fitting form of @xcite , which is very similar to the canonical results of @xcite in this regime ( see @xcite ) ,",

    "however , using the liquid diffusion results of @xcite , we obtain @xmath106 . regardless of this uncertainty",

    "nuclear reaction rates and energies are from @xcite with screening enhancement factors for high density from @xcite , which also appear in @xcite    the above treatment of the outer edge of the c / o core provides a reasonable approximation to the evolution of this region during a cn cycle without the complications of explicit simulation . at @xmath119 the temperature change due to adiabatic compression is 1% . under this approximation in the equilibrium state discussed in ",
    "[ sec : equil ] , fluid elements near the base of the accreted layer move on paths for which they must lose entropy during the cn cycle , i.e. ones more shallow than the adiabat in the @xmath81-@xmath120 plane .",
    "deeper fluid elements move on paths for which they must gain entropy , steeper than the adiabat .",
    "this exchange is consistent with our expectation for the actual evolution , and since it only contributes peripherally by setting the gross temperature excursion from @xmath1 at the base of the accreted layer , the accuracy of a more sophisticated treatment is not considered worth its price in complexity at this point .",
    "the fraction of the core affected by the cn cycle in this treatment is also roughly consistent with that expected on energetic grounds .",
    "for example , a luminosity of @xmath121 delivers enough energy in the interval between classical novae , @xmath122 years , to raise the temperature of the outer @xmath123 of the core by @xmath124 k ( @xmath125 ) , this mass coordinate corresponds to a pressure of just under @xmath126 erg @xmath93 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath1 for several @xmath7 s are shown in figure [ fig : l - tc ] for a @xmath127 wd ( @xmath128 cm ) with @xmath129 .",

    "is the @xmath26-@xmath1 relation for an isolated @xmath11 wd with pure layers of mass @xmath131 and @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding relation for our envelope model , with @xmath133 , is shown as the dashed line and provides an initial comparison to previous work .",
    "the offset from the cooling wd is due to the h / he envelope being more opaque than that of pure hydrogen .",
    "the slightly larger divergence for @xmath134 k @xmath135 k is likely due to the radiative - conductive transition point lying below the outer h - rich layer , a location where the cooling model has a thick layer of helium whereas our envelope is pure carbon .",
    "the sharp change in the dotted line at @xmath136 is due to surface convection extending down into the conductive regions , commonly termed `` convective coupling '' @xcite . to avoid this complication ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to @xmath137 , where the outer convective layer need not be modelled directly to determine the @xmath26-@xmath1 relation .",
    "we now discuss how the @xmath26-@xmath1 relation changes under active accretion .",
    "it is only for low @xmath7 s and high @xmath1 s that the luminosity flowing through the envelope is dominated by the hot core .",
    "the @xmath1 below which the energy release due to accretion becomes important is determined by @xmath7 ; higher values release energy faster via compressional heating and therefore their luminosity becomes dominated by accretion at a higher @xmath1 .",
    "thus in figure [ fig : l - tc ] , while there is a large area of the curve at @xmath100 yr@xmath24 for which core cooling dominates at this @xmath32 , there is little such area at @xmath138 yr@xmath24 .",
    "the upturn in the luminosity at @xmath139 k is due to energy released from fusion of @xmath5he , a species not present in abundance in the cooling models .",
    "the onset of the nuclear energy source is quite sensitive to @xmath32 since the conditions ( @xmath81 , @xmath140 ) at the base of the h / he layer dominate this effect ( see section [ sec : ign ] for details ) .",
    "the other major feature of the @xmath26-@xmath1 curve is the minimum @xmath26 for a given @xmath7 . in this situation",
    "the envelope determines its own temperature and the surface luminosity becomes independent of @xmath1 .",
    "there is a temperature inversion in the envelope : the temperature rises inward through the radiative layer , flattens out when conduction becomes dominant , passes through a @xmath141 and then decreases towards the core .",
    "the energy liberated by compression goes into the core as well as coming out the surface .",
    "this lower limit , @xmath142 , is shown in figure [ fig : l_0 ] as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the upper solid curve is for @xmath29 and @xmath143 .",
    "raising @xmath32 does not change the relation  a curve for @xmath144 is indistinguishable  except to reduce the maximum @xmath26 at which such a self - supported envelope state can exist .",
    "a higher @xmath32 leads to a higher density at the base of the accreted layer and causes fusion to become important at lower envelope temperatures and luminosities .",
    "the dotted line is a rough approximation found by identifying @xmath145 with the core temperature of a cooling wd , giving @xmath146 , and by assuming that those losses are matched by compressional heating , so that @xmath147 ( from appendix [ app : estimate ] ) .",
    "putting these together and using the point at @xmath148 yr@xmath24 to set the constant gives @xmath149 ( dotted line ) .",
    "calibrating the cooling luminosity separately from the @xmath133 curve on the earlier figure [ fig : l - tc ] gives a prefactor which differs from this by less than a factor of 2 , demonstrating that the estimate from appendix [ app : estimate ] is good for low @xmath7 s .",
    "while the @xmath150 dependence is fairly well matched at low @xmath7 s , the full calculation gives increasingly lower luminosities at higher @xmath7 s because when fusion provides some of the energy , @xmath141 need not be as high , so that the luminosity is less .",

    "finally we explore the dependence of the @xmath26-@xmath1 relation on @xmath39 .",
    "generally , the energy released by compression in the envelope should increase with @xmath32 due to the lower @xmath153 for h / he relative to c / o as it appears in the compressional heating term ( see eq .  [ dldp ] ) .",

    "it gives the compression rate at a fixed mass coordinate , @xmath363 , due to accretion .",
    "nomoto ( 1982 ) showed that it is independent of @xmath363 within the deep interior , so that @xmath364 , and equation ( [ eq : lumins2 ] ) becomes @xmath365 where the last term gets large near the surface and is evaluated in appendix b as part of the outer envelope integration ( see equation b3 ) . at @xmath366 , @xmath367 and @xmath368 , so for a @xmath369 wd we get the simple relation for compression of the deep interior of the wd @xmath370 implying that the core can remain at a fixed temperature during compression from accretion as long as the exiting luminosity is @xmath371 comparison of this with the corresponding estimate for the accreted layers from appendix [ app : estimate ] , equation ( [ eq : lestimate ] ) , demonstrates that , even if the wd core is accumulating mass on a secular timescale ( i.e. no ejection of matter ) , then , since @xmath233 , such an exiting luminosity as @xmath372 would be a small perturbation on the thermal state of the envelope .",
    "this statement would change for a helium wd , where @xmath373 , in which case the core luminosity could modify the envelope structure .",

    "the lower limit is the pressure at which the transition to degeneracy occurs , this is simply @xmath383 in cgs units for a solar mixture .",
    "the upper limit is the pressure at the base of the accreted envelope @xmath384 . from our results , at @xmath280 yr@xmath24 , @xmath385 k and @xmath386 . using these values",
    "gives @xmath387 erg @xmath93 and @xmath388 erg @xmath93 and thus @xmath389 although the limits taken actually depend on @xmath1 , they appear in a logarithm so only the strongest temperature dependence is shown explicitly .",
    "using @xmath390 for solar material to eliminate @xmath391 and adding the luminosity from the nondegenerate and degenerate portions of the accreted layer gives @xmath392 this fiducial estimate of the compressional heating proves helpful in our analytic understanding of our initial results ."
