    "this hypothesis certainly fails for systems with an absorbing steady state such as simple models for diffusion - limited chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "here there are no fluctuations in the steady state but the approach towards the absorbing state is critical in the sense that it exhibits slow power - law decay and universal scaling behavior  @xcite . most of these models are chosen to be mathematically transparent hoping that they still resemble some of the essential features of actual systems occurring in nature .",

    "the probability of such or higher order events grows with decreasing nucleation time .",
    "then , the lattice will be covered by several domains , locally ordered areas which may be out of phase on the microtubule lattice . in order to finally reach a homogeneous decoration with only one predominant domain a secondary process is needed which leads to a coarsening of the initial grain - like structure .",
    "this secondary process includes domain wall wandering and annihilation induced by the detachment and re - attachment of kinesin dimers . as mentioned above ,",
    "such annealing processes are expected to be much slower than the unhindered growth of individual domains .",

    "the dynamics becomes more intriguing when a strong attraction between the @xmath1-mers is introduced .",
    "an example of such a system is tropomyosin  @xcite , a protein that plays a key role in the regulation of muscle contraction . in muscle",
    "each tropomyosin molecule binding on an actin filament occupies seven actin monomers ( although other isoforms covering 5 or 6 monomers exist as well  @xcite ) and thereby obstructs the action of myosin motors .",
    "the binding of tropomyosin to actin is strongly cooperative  the binding constant next to a bound molecule is 1000 times larger than at an isolated place  @xcite .",
    "the initial binding phase is analog to the problem of interacting dimers and can again be described using a grain growth model  @xcite . after the initial phase , gaps with sizes between @xmath6 and @xmath7 sites will remain .",
    "their sizes are distributed randomly with equal probabilities of @xmath8 for each gap size .",
    "what follows is again a process on a much longer time - scale in which @xmath1-mers at edges of the gaps can detach and re - attach .",

    "[ fig_effective_steps]b and c ) , each containing between @xmath6 and @xmath7 sites with randomly distributed probabilities , can either join to a single gap ( fig .",

    "any other gap size will be the outcome in @xmath15 cases , therefore having the probability @xmath16 .",
    "again we can represent gaps as particles @xmath17 hopping randomly along the lattice and joining or annihilating when two of them meet .",
    "the pair creation processes become relevant only if the particle concentration approaches its equilibrium value and will be neglected for now .",
    "then , we can map our model to a diffusion - coagulation - annihilation model consisting of following reactions @xmath18",
    "the fundamental difference between the interacting @xmath1-mer and the dimer model is that the @xmath1-mer model not only contains pair annihilation but also pair coagulation processes , @xmath19 .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite all diffusion - annihilation models of the type @xmath20 ( or generally @xmath21 ) belong to the same universality class . in the asymptotic limit",

    "hence , we finally obtain @xmath26 interestingly , the asymptotic particle concentration is independent of its initial value , _",

    "( [ eq_ngt ] ) and the dotted line the mean - field power law @xmath4 .",
    "the thin solid and dashed line show the equilibrium values of @xmath31 and @xmath29 using the expression from ref .",
    "the parameters are : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ]    of course , the mapping to the @xmath38 model is valid only as long as the concentration of particles @xmath17 is well above its equilibrium concentration .",
    "otherwise , particle splitting events like @xmath39 also become relevant .",
    "if the concentration @xmath28 is high enough , the @xmath40 regime will be followed by a regime where , due to these splitting events , the average gap size will finally approach one site , which then are randomly distributed over the lattice .",
    "the number of gaps will decay according to the mean - field prediction @xmath41 , as it does in the non - interacting @xmath1-mer model  @xcite .",
    "an example of this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pentamer ] .",
    "when the system approaches equilibrium , processes of pair creation @xmath42 become important as well .",
    "similar to the dimer model , these processes leads to a final exponential relaxation towards equilibrium . the equilibrium gap size and distribution of the interacting @xmath1-mer model",
    "are known exactly from a study by mcghee and von hippel  @xcite .",
    "in this contribution we have discussed the kinetics of some macromolecular assembly processes relevant for the formation of functional structures in cells . in particular , we were interested in the dynamics of ligand - substrate binding , where the substrate is a one- or two - dimensional lattice and the ligands are dimers or oligomers .",
    "as examples we picked binding of dimeric kinesin on microtubules and tropomyosin on actin filaments .",
    "there are other related systems where protein ligands bind to biological macromolecules , e.g.  proteins to dna or antibodies to viruses .",
    "our theory allows us to study the effects of _ steric constraints , binding rates and interaction between neighboring proteins _ on the binding dynamics and binding stoichiometry .",
    "our key results are as follows .",
    "the collective dynamics turns out to be not only much slower than the kinetics of single molecules but it also shows some interesting dynamic anomalies . quite generally , we find that the binding kinetics goes through several qualitatively different stages . at small times",
    "when deposition processes are frequent but detachment processes are still unlikely , the kinetics can be described in terms of sequential deposition models .",
    "such models have been analyzed in various contexts years ago so that there are many exact results available .",
    "after this initial phase the system is left in a `` metastable '' or `` locked '' configuration , _",
    "i.e. _ a configuration with many small vacant regions between blocks of bound molecules prohibiting binding of additional ligands to the substrate . as a consequence",
    "one obtains an intermediate plateau regime for the binding stoichiometry . for escaping from this",
    "locked configuration vacant regions have to merge in order to accommodate for the deposition of additional ligands .",
    "these are extremely slow processes mediated by a sequence of detachment and re - attachment processes . upon identifying the gaps with particles @xmath17",
    "we have shown that the dynamics in this regime can be explained by mapping it onto reaction - diffusion models . for stiff dimers",
    "the corresponding model is @xmath43 resulting in a gap density that decays with a power law @xmath44 before it approaches the final equilibrium value . taking into account that actual biological dimers have some level of flexibility the model had to be generalized to include a second species of particles @xmath45 , representing dimers bound with only one head .",
    "the corresponding reaction - diffusion model is then of the type @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "while its dynamics is more complex at short times , the model becomes equivalent to the @xmath48 if the transitions between @xmath17 and @xmath45 become faster than the typical annihilation time .",
    "if , on the other hand , one introduces a strong diffusion of adsorbed dimers the power - law decay is preceded by a mean - field regime where the gap density decays with @xmath49 .",
    "the two - stage relaxation and the mapping to the @xmath9 model remain valid even if there is an attractive interaction between adsorbed dimers on the one - dimensional lattice . in the two - dimensional model with interaction",
    ", the sequential deposition stage goes over into a nucleation process and the relaxation stage into a much slower annealing process . yet",
    "even then the two - stage relaxation remains qualitatively the same .",
    "the annealing process for interacting @xmath1-mers with @xmath50 is fundamentally different from the dimer model .",
    "one finds that non - interacting @xmath1-mers are always well described with the mean - field kinetics of the model @xmath51 predicting a decay in the gap density @xmath4 . introducing a strong interaction between the @xmath1-mers ,",
    "as is the case for tropomyosin binding on actin filaments , we find a mapping to the @xmath52 model , valid for concentrations well above the equilibrium value , which shows a particle concentration decaying @xmath53 .",
    "closer to equilibrium other processes become important as well .",
    "first , particle splitting , @xmath39 leads to an intermediate mean - field regime similar to that of non - interacting @xmath1-mers .",
    "later the events of pair creation , @xmath42 become relevant and lead the system into the final exponential relaxation towards equilibrium .",
    "all of the above results concern the statics and dynamics of ligands decorating periodic structures in the absence of atp hydrolysis .",
    "such systems are `` passive '' in the sense that the ligands bind and unbind from their respective substrates but do not show any motor activity , _",
    "i.e. _ move along these molecular tracks . as described above , this allowed us to give a detailed description of decoration experiments and to analyze corresponding experiments quantitatively .",
    "we also were able to identify and quantify cooperative effects between kinesin dimers .",
    "as our results show , the relaxation time in many experimental or biological systems can be extremely long .",
    "therefore , one has to be aware that an experiment where the measurement is taken soon after the start of the decoration often does not show the equilibrium configuration , but rather some intermediate state from the relaxation process .    a natural extensions of this work is to investigate `` active '' systems composed of an ensemble of motor proteins and their respective substrates in the presence of transport along the molecular tracks driven by the chemical energy of atp hydrolysis .",
    "understanding such systems lies at the heart of many cellular processes .",
    "although single processive motors like kinesin or myosin v can move loads over considerable distances , the number of motors acting simultaneously when transporting vesicles through the cytoplasm can be pretty large .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the force acting on a bead in the cell has been estimated as @xmath54 , which implies that at least @xmath55 motor proteins were involved .",
    "how these active motors cooperate at high densities and what role is played by interactions between them , is to a large extend a still unexplored field with many open questions .",
    "an even broader range of questions arises when one tries to understand how cells organize their interior to fulfill their various duties . while organizing its interior , the cell has to physically separate molecules or molecular aggregates from each other , define distinct functional regions , and actively transport molecules between these regions .",
    "such processes rely on the assembly and ordering processes of macromolecules inside the cell and on forces that may be generated by molecular assembly or by the action of motor proteins .",
    "understanding the principles underlying those complex cellular processes not only requires biological and biochemical studies but also studies of physical processes . in this respect microtubules and motors have been used as _ in vitro _",
    "model systems to study various aspects of regulation and self - organization of cellular structures .",
    "it was shown theoretically and experimentally that the dynamic instability of microtubules in combination with microtubule polymerization forces is sufficient to provide a microtubule organizing center with a mechanism to position itself at the center of a confined geometry @xcite . in a simple _ in vitro _",
    "system consisting solely of multi - headed constructs of the motor protein kinesin and stabilized microtubules the formation of asters and spiral defects was shown @xcite . by varying the relative concentration of the components a variety of self - organized structures ( patterns ) where observed . the pattern formation observed in these simple",
    "_ in vitro _",
    "systems are only first examples of what will be a much broader range of self - tuned or regulated structural and temporal organization in biological systems .",
    "the control parameter determining the structure was the relative concentration of the components . in cellular processes",
    "there are , however , other possible parameters for controlling and regulating such as binding of a host of associated binding proteins .",
    "we expect that these and other related biological processes are a source for fascinating cooperative effects and a multitude of interesting nonequilibrium dynamic phenomena .",
    "we would like to thank eckhard mandelkow and andreas hoenger for helpful discussion about microtubule decoration experiments and their relevance for studying motor proteins .",
