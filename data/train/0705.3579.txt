    "the non - rotating background shows pure schwarzschild geometry outside the event horizon whereas the rotating background demonstrates the restricted kerr geometry in the vicinity of the event horizon which admits a variable lapse function with negligible rotation .",
    "we have taken schwarzschild black hole with rotating background due to the well - known fact that the schwarzschild black hole is the minimum configuration of the kerr black hole .    in the case of non - rotating background",
    ", we have found that the magnetospheric fluid is normally disperse .",
    "the wave number becomes indefinite at the horizon and for the values of @xmath18 near the horizon and hence no wave is present there .",

    "the wave number becomes infinite at event horizon and in the neighborhood of the event horizon and no wave exists there .    in rotating magnetized background , we obtain region with negative wave number , phase velocity , group velocity and refractive index ( figures 7 and 9 ) . this fact is deduced by the analysis of two of the dispersion relations obtained in section 5 .",
    "the refractive index is negative in both the cases which implies that the region possesses all the qualities of left - handed metamaterials .",
    "the other three dispersion relations give that the region under discussion is of non - normal dispersion which restrict the real signals pass through that region .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the wave number becomes infinite at the event horizon and no wave exists there .",
    "this supports the well - known point of view that no information can be extracted from a black hole .",
    "it is interesting to mention that this work extends the results given by mackay et al . in [ 33 ] according to which rotation of a black hole is required for negative phase velocity propagation .",
    "it is also observed that the waves of less angular velocity are evanescent .",
    "our numerical results indicate that negative phase velocity propagates in the rotating background whether the black hole is rotating or non - rotating .",
    "we know that the mhd waves in cold plasma are non - dispersive .",
    "however , the dispersion is noted in the above figures .",
    "this factor comes due to the formalism used and the equations which provides different equations from the usual mhd equations . since the 3 + 1 split of gr is used in a preliminary investigation of waves propagating in a plasma influenced by the gravitational field .",
    "thus internal gravity waves which interrupt the mhd waves imply the cases of dispersion in each of the hypersurface .",
    "we would like to mention that graphs of the waves are given in a particular hypersurface where time is constant , not in the whole schwarzschild background and consequently this is justified locally , not globally .",
    "finally , it is mentioned that some of the figures have patches missing which is due to the existence of complex numbers there .",
    "mathematica can not plot complex numbers with real numbers .",
    "these complex numbers are shown by gaps in the figures .",
    "this analysis has been done for the cold plasma state .",
