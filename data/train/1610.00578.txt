    ", due to its increasing radiation pressure and associated eddington factor @xmath0 prior to explosion ( see fig.2 )    it is clear that we need to understand the mass - loss properties of massive stars at high @xmath1 , but before addressing this aspect we first review the mass - loss rates of normal o - stars ( at moderate @xmath1 parameters ) .",
    "i assume basic knowledge of radiation - driven wind theory , but see owocki ( 2015 ) and vink ( 2015 ) for more information .",
    "the radiation - driven wind theory was developed in the 1970s by lucy & solomon ( 1970 ) and castor , abbott & klein ( 1975 ; hereafter cak ) .",
    "for many years it was thought that the strong , optically thick , lines of carbon , oxygen and nitrogen ( cno ) were the most important wind drivers  due to the relatively high abundance of these elements  causing their presence in the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of early - type stars .",
    "however , we now know that despite its relatively minor cosmic abundance , it is the millions of weak ( and optically thin ) iron ( fe ) lines below the critical ( sonic ) point that set the mass - loss rates in massive o - star winds ( vink et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "the mass - loss recipes from these authors are now widely used in the evolution of massive stars , but questions have been raised regarding the absolute strengths of the normal there is a _ weak wind _",

    "2005 , puls et al .",
    "this corresponds to spectral types later than o6.5v ( muijres et al .",
    "2012 ) and may be due to a lack of subsonic radiative driving due to a recombination of fe v to iv at that @xmath2 . if true , this would imply the physics of an `` inverse '' bi - stability jump ] o - star winds , due to the widespread presence of wind inhomogeneities , or clumping ( e.g. puls et al .",
    "2008 ; cantiello et al .",
    "fullerton et al . ( 2006 ) highlighted the problem of wind clumping in the form of the so - called phosphorus v problem : if the winds of massive stars are inhomogeneous and the clumps can be treated in the micro - clumping approximation ( see also bouret et al .",
    "2003 ) , then the most likely solution for the p v problem in the uv part of the spectrum would be _ far _ lower mass - loss rates ( see fig.3 ) , perhaps by an order - of - magnitude .    [ width=]oskinova_clump_figure    the p v problem was solved when oskinova et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( see also sundqvist et al . 2010 ; surlan et al . 2013 ) introduced the concept of porosity or `` macro - clumping '' , previously constructed for x - ray observations , to the uv part of the spectrum ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the pv line can now be fit , without needing to reduce the empirical mass - loss rate excessively .",
    "the unclumped empirical mass - loss rates are still overestimated by a factor of the square - root of the clumping factor , but as long as clumping is moderate , with clumping factors 6 - 8 , the reduced mass - loss rates ( by factor 2 - 3 ) agree with the theoretical rates of vink et al .",
    "( see the discussions in repolust et al .",
    "2004 ; mokiem et al .",
    "2007 ; ramirez - agudelo et al . 2016 ) .",
    "for normal o - type stars , say in the luminosity range @xmath3 , there is no guarantee that the clumping factor is a factor 6 - 8 , as may seemingly have been suggested in the previous paragraph .",
    "if the _ true _ clumping factor is larger than 6 - 8 , the vink et al .",
    "rates would be too large compared to empirical values .",
    "the interesting question is now if we can establish what the correct clumping factor is in o - star winds ?    for the more extreme winds of wolf - rayet stars ( including both classical wr stars , as well as very massive stars ( vms ) of the wnh sequence ) the spectral lines are in emission , and owing to the presence of electron scattering wings , which depend linearly on density ( versus the quadratic density behaviour of the central recombination part of the emission line ) , one may constrain the clumping factor ( hillier et all .",
    "1991 ) . on the basis of this methodology",
    "the potsdam group ( e.g. hamann & koesterke 1998 ) usually quote clumping factors in the range 4 - 16 , with mass - loss rate reductions for wr stars ( in comparison to unclumped empirical rates ) of @xmath4 , with a reasonable average clumping factor of @xmath510 , i.e. a mass - loss rate reduction of @xmath53 ( hamann et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "for decades it was known that wolf - rayet stars are special in comparison to o stars in that the wind efficiency number @xmath6 exceeds unity due to highly efficient multiple scattering ( e.g. gayley et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , it was not until it became clear that vms with masses exceeding @xmath7 exist ( crowther et al .",
    "2010 , bestenlehner et al .",
    "2011 , vink et al . 2015 ) that we were able to construct a mass ( and luminosity ) sequence of o and vms - wnh stars , sampling the entire upper initial mass function ( imf ) , including the entire o - of - of / wn - wnh spectral sequence  and to utilize this to calibrate stellar wind mass - loss rates using the @xmath8 relation ( vink & grfener 2012 ) .",
    "vink & grfener ( 2012 ) showed that the transition luminosity between optically thin of stars ( with @xmath9 ) and optically thick ( with @xmath10 ) wnh stars in the arches cluster ( based on cmfgen modelling by martins et al .",
    "2008 ) could be utilised to derive the transition mass - loss rate . as this model - independent transition mass - loss rate agrees well with both the theoretical mass - loss rates of vink et al .",
    ", as well as the empirical mass - loss rates of martins et al .",
    "( for an assumed clumping factor of 10 ) this provides a strong consistency argument  resulting in the first mass - loss calibration in astronomy .",
    "moreover , this provides evidence for strong mass - loss for vms , ensuring `` evaporation '' of galactic stars due to mass loss .",
    "this would make it highly unlikely that exotic phenomena involving gamma - ray bursts ( vink & de koter 2005 ) , pair - instability sne ( langer et al .",

    "2016 ) would call for low - metallicity environments according to our wind models ( belczynksi et al .",
    "2010 )  providing a relationship between the maximum mass of stellar black holes and metallicity .",
    "[ width=]mdotmass - crop    the previous section concluded that we know the mass - loss rates of massive stars at the transition luminosity very accurately .",
    "as long as the clumping factor for lower luminosity `` normal '' o - stars in the luminosity range @xmath3 is not much larger than @xmath510 , we can be confident that the vink et al .",
    "( 2000 ) relation provides accurate mass - loss rates , as these rates have now been calibrated at the high mass - luminosity end , against a model independent anchor ( which is clumping and porosity independent ) .",
    "however , for vms with luminosities _ above _ the transition luminosity , the vink et al .",
    "relationship would _ under_estimate the true mass - loss rates , as the vink et al .",

    "( 2011 ) computed monte carlo radiative acceleration models ( based on an original concept by abbott & lucy 1985 ) into the regime of vms up to 300@xmath12 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the plot shows a relatively shallow slope for optically thin o - star winds with @xmath13 ( in reasonable agreement with cak theory ) at relatively low @xmath14 values , turning into a much steeper slope , above the transition mass - loss rate , where @xmath15 ( see also vink 2006 ) .",
    "this steeper slope is not yet adopted into most stellar evolutionary models for vms ( e.g. yusof et al .",
    "2013 ; koehler et al .",
    "2015 ) , although chen et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have made first attempts in this direction .",
    "figure 4 involves a set of theoretical computations for mass - loss rates at high eddington factor @xmath14 , relevant for vms , but they have yet to be tested against observations . in order to test the transition from optically thin to optically thick winds , it is important to sample the upper imf , which is only possible for the most massive clusters in the local universe . in the context of the vlt - flames",

    "the results are presented in fig.5 and in bestenlehner et al .",
    "the most notable aspect of our empirical work is that we do indeed _ confirm _ the presence of a kink at a critical @xmath14 value .",
    "furthermore , the slope in the mass - loss relation of the upper @xmath14 range was found to be 5 , also in perfect agreement with our theoretical monte carlo models ( vink 2006 ; vink et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "it should be noted that this steep increase of @xmath16 above a critical @xmath14 value can not be explained by cak theory , where the steep increase only takes place at @xmath14 values extremely close to 1 , unless one were to chance the cak - parameter @xmath17 at the kink , but to all intents and purposes , a change in @xmath17 at the kink versus a kink in its own right , represent a similar physical effect , due to the increased optical depth .",
    "finally , we should note that despite the qualitative success regarding ( i ) the presence of a kink , and ( ii ) the value of the steep slope ( of 5 ) at the high @xmath14 end , the location of the kink in terms of the exact @xmath14 value ( and related to different opacity treatments , and derivations of the @xmath14 factor for ( in)homogeneous stellar evolution models ) implies that there is still quantitative work ahead of us in establishing accurate empirical and theoretical mass - loss rates for vms .    a similar uncertainty exists for massive stars in evolved evolutionary phases , e.g. in the lbv and classical wr phase , where the @xmath14 factor might be substantial too .",

    "the reason for the apparent changes in effective temperature has not been fully understood , but the leading contender is thought to be envelope inflation ( grfener et al .",
