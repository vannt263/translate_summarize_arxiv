    "circumstellar discs surrounding young stellar objects ( ysos ) have been the focus of much research because not only do they provide the location for possible planet formation to occur , but they play an essential role in the regulation and evolution of the accretion that takes place during the star formation process ( see the review of @xcite ) .",
    "pre - main sequence herbig ae and be stars ( haebes , see @xcite ) lie in the mass range between lower mass t tauri stars ( @xmath2m@xmath3 ) and short - lived , obscured massive young stellar objects ( mysos , @xmath4m@xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , they offer a unique opportunity to observe and characterise any similarities or differences between low- and high - mass star formation processes ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "for example , across the mass range between t tauri stars and mysos , there is evidence for a change in the mechanism that transfers material from the surrounding natal cloud , through the disc , and on to the central protostar .",
    "the mechanism is thought to switch from t tauri - like magnetospheric accretion - in which the disc is truncated at radial distances no larger than the co - rotation radius and accretion proceeds to the stellar surface via magnetically channelled accretion funnels @xcite - to some other , as yet uncharacterised phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the reason for this possible change in accretion mechanism is because the interior envelopes of haebes are thought to be mostly radiative in nature @xcite .",
    "therefore , they lack the interior convection currents required to power strong magnetic fields - a requirement for such magnetospheric accretion to occur .",
    "recent observations show a low detection rate of magnetic fields ( @xmath57 per cent ) across a large sample of haebes , supporting this scenario @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the lower mass herbig ae stars undergo similar magnetospheric accretion to that of t tauri stars @xcite , but the situation for the higher mass herbig be stars is not known .",
    "an alternative to magnetospheric accretion is direct accretion ( also called boundary layer accretion ) , where material from the disc is accreted directly onto the stellar surface , along the ecliptic plane @xcite . for boundary layer accretion to occur",
    ", a disc - like geometry would have to be present on scales smaller than the co - rotation radius of the star - the location at which any magnetospheric accretion funnels would likely begin to operate @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to investigate the accretion mechanisms of these young stars , information on the geometry of inner regions of the circumstellar disc , close to the central star is required .    while it is believed that dust is responsible for most of the thermal emission from circumstellar discs , it is likely that gas is responsible for the majority of their mass .",
    "haebes possess strong stellar radiation fields compared to that of their lower mass counterparts . because of this",
    ", regions of their circumstellar discs close to the central star are likely to be heated to high temperatures .",
    "if this temperature exceeds the dust sublimation temperature , then the dust in the disc is destroyed .",
    "this gives rise to an inner disc consisting of only gas , out to the location of the dust sublimation radius , on scales of a few astronomical units ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "direct observations of these regions of haebes are complicated by the fact that most objects lie at relatively large distances .",
    "thus , the small sizes of the regions involved mean that imaging is only possible using interferometry . however , this is an observationally complex task limited to bright targets @xcite . therefore , there is much interest in determining more indirect observational techniques that can probe the conditions close to the central star .",
    "the most abundant molecule in circumstellar discs is molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath6 ) .",
    "however , the large energies required to excite h@xmath6 , low transition probabilities , and atmospheric absorption across the relevant wavelength range mean that thermal emission from this molecule is difficult to observe , and it is therefore not an efficient tracer of these regions . coupled rotational and vibrational emission of the next most abundant molecule , co , offers an alternative diagnostic .",
    "co bandhead emission ( also called overtone emission ) is excited in warm ( @xmath7 25005000k ) and dense ( n @xmath8 @xmath9@xmath10 ) neutral gas - exactly the conditions expected in the inner parts of accretion discs , making this emission a valuable probe of these regions @xcite .",
    "several previous investigations have been successful in fitting the co bandhead spectra of young stars under the assumption that the emission originates from a gaseous circumstellar disc @xcite .",
    "the @xmath114 transition of atomic hydrogen ( hi ) in the brackett series ( br@xmath1 ) occurs at @xmath12 = 2.16 , and is also excited at high temperatures ( @xmath13k ) .",
    "the origin of such hydrogen recombination emission is still unknown .",
    "several theories have been proposed , including ; magnetospheric accretion phenomena @xcite , inner disc regions @xcite , stellar winds @xcite and disk winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the br@xmath1 line luminosity in a sample of low mass ( 0.20.8m@xmath3 ) t tauri stars was tightly correlated with the accretion luminosity as measured from blue continuum excess .",
    "@xcite extended this investigation to ysos with masses up to 4m@xmath3 , and find good agreement with the previous study , and the relationship was used to examine the accretion rates of 36 herbig ae stars by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite determined accretion luminosities from 38 herbig ae and be stars by examining the uv excess in the balmer discontinuity , and found a correlation with br@xmath1 luminosity similar to @xcite .",
    "this paper utilises a collection of very large telescope ( vlt ) x - shooter and crires observations of several herbig ae / be objects based on the detection of co first overtone bandhead emission in their spectra . the observations , sample selection and determination of stellar parameters are described in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the measured observable quantities are presented and analysed in section [ sec : obsres ] .",
    "modelling of the co spectra is discussed , and comments on individual objects are given in section [ sec : modres ] .",
    "discussion of the results from both sets of observations is presented in section [ sec : discussion ] , and finally conclusions are outlined in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the observations for this investigation were obtained using two instruments on the eso vlt at cerro paranal .",
    "high resolution @xmath14 spectra of 5 herbig ae / be stars , targeted because of previous detection of co first overtone bandhead emission , were obtained using the cryogenic spectrograph crires @xcite .",
    "the crires observations of hd 36917 , hd 259431 and hd 58647 were taken on 26 and 27 october 2010 . using a slit width of 0.2 arcsec , the observations achieved spectral resolution of approximately 80000 .",
    "the observations of pds 37 were taken on 06 june 2007 and originally published in @xcite . using a slit width of 0.6 arcsec , a spectral resolution of approximately 30000",
    "was achieved .",
    "the archival observations of hd 101412 were taken on 5 april 2011 , and were originally published by @xcite . using a slit width of 0.2 arcsec ,",
    "this achieved a spectral resolution of over 90000 .",
    "telluric line removal for all crires observations was performed using standard stars at comparable airmasses , obtained during the same observing run as the science observations .",
    "in addition to the targeted crires observations , a medium resolution spectroscopic survey was performed using the cross - dispersed wide band spectrograph x - shooter @xcite .",
    "a total of 91 objects were observed in service mode between october 2009 and march 2010 ( @xcite , fairlamb et al . , in prep ) .",
    "x - shooter provides simultaneous wavelength coverage from 3002480 nm using three spectrograph arms - uvb , vis , and nir .",
    "the original sample of 91 herbig ae / be stars were taken from the catalogues of @xcite and @xcite , and were selected based on sky co - ordinates appropriate for the observing semester .",
    "a small number were discarded due to insufficient brightness or ambiguous assignment as a haebe star .",
    "this sample is larger than most other published studies by a factor of 25 .",
    "in addition to the large sample size , the use of x - shooter allows comparison of many spectral features from a single observation , which is important given that haebes have been shown to be both photometrically and spectrally variable @xcite . this paper utilises data from the nir arm , and deals mainly with the subset of six objects from the full sample that showed a detection of co first overtone bandhead emission at 2.3 .",
    "the observations using x - shooter achieved a spectral resolution of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 nm at @xmath17 ) using a slit width of 0.4arcsec .",
    "a single pixel element covered 0.06 nm , while a resolution element covered 4.3 pixels .",
    "the atmospheric seeing conditions in the optical varied from 1.11.6arcsec between observations .",
    "the exposure times ranged from several minutes for the brightest sources , up to 30 minutes for the faintest ones . nodding along the slit",
    "was performed to allow background subtraction .",
    "the data were reduced with version 0.9.7 of the eso pipeline software @xcite , and verified with manually reduced data for a handful of objects to ensure consistency .",
    "the data were of high quality , with signal - to - noise ratios of 100140 in most cases across the entire sample of haebes .    to correct telluric absorption features within the x - shooter spectra , the eso software molecfit was used ( smette et al .",
    "2014 , in prep .",
    ", kausch et al .",
    "2014 , in prep . ) .",
    "the molecfit program models the atmospheric absorption above the telescope using temperature , pressure and humidity profiles for the observing site , a radiative transfer code , and a database of molecular parameters .",
    "we used the code to accurately model the atmospheric absorption features in the telluric observations themselves .",
    "this then produced model telluric spectra tuned to the exact atmospheric conditions measured on the night of the observation , but free from the effects of noise .",
    "these model spectra were then used to remove telluric features from the science observations , which resulted in a better correction than was possible using the standard stars alone .",
    "a log of the observations of these objects is shown in table [ tab : haebe_obs ] , their spectra around the co first overtone and br@xmath1 region are shown in figures [ fig : crires_spectra ] and [ fig : xshooter_spectra ] , and their astrophysical parameters are given in table [ tab : haebe_stellar_params ] .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      the object hd 101412 provides useful test case for our analysis , as it has been observed with both x - shooter at medium resolution and crires at high resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : reso ] shows the comparison of the @xmath0 20 bandhead for both sets of observations",
    ".     shows much detail that is not distinguishable when considering data of a lower spectral resolution of @xmath18 . ]",
    "the crires spectrum at @xmath19 shows much detail that is not seen when the considering data of a lower spectral resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , the individual rotational transitions in the blue shoulder of the bandhead and the double - peaked rotational transitions are almost entirely lost in the x - shooter spectrum .",
    "when the crires spectrum is convolved with a gaussian corresponding to the spectral resolution of the x - shooter data , re - binned the appropriate amount , and given a similar level of random noise , the data appears qualitatively similar to the x - shooter spectrum .",
    "however , measurement of the equivalent width of the original and degraded crires spectra yielded very similar results ( 2.8 ) , while measurement of the x - shooter spectrum gave a larger equivalent width of 5.1 , suggesting that the co first overtone emission in hd 101412 may be variable .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that much information is lost when the spectrum is degraded to the resolution of x - shooter .",
    "we performed the fitting routine on both the high resolution crires data and the lower resolution x - shooter data for hd 101412 .",
    "the fitting routine performed poorly on the x - shooter data , recovering multiple best fit solutions at similar @xmath20 values with very different parameters ( which we do not show here ) .",
    "we attribute this to the low resolution data not showing important features in the spectra , such as the blue shoulder of the bandhead and the narrow , double peaked rotational transitions mentioned earlier .",
    "however , when the fitting routine was performed on the high resolution crires spectra for hd 101412 , a single , unambiguous best fitting model was obtained .",
    "given the issues of fitting the x - shooter spectra described previously , we chose to restrict our modelling of the co bandheads to the 5 objects observed with crires .",
    "the results of this fitting are shown in table [ tab : disco_fits ] and figure [ fig : disco_fits ] .",

    "for instance , they assume an isothermal ring of co with fixed parameters such as inclination , and the fitting was performed visually with no systematic @xmath94 minimisation . however , the results here still suggest a narrow ring of co , at approximately distance from the central protostar , at a slightly cooler temperature .",
    "high spectral resolution observations of the [ oi ] emission line at 6300 were examined by @xcite , who determined that this emission originates from a region in a disc from 0.1510au , viewed at an inclination of 30 , and corresponds to a @xmath95 of 8kms@xmath48 .",

    "this interpretation could explain why we apparently detect co bandhead emission beyond the dust sublimation radius in hd 101412 , in contrast to the other objects studied here .",
    "our best fitting model for the spectrum of hd 101412 suggests a relatively cool ( @xmath96k ) but high density ( @xmath97@xmath35 ) emission environment - if there is a sufficient amount of dense gas located above the highly settled dust in the disc , then co first overtone emission may originate from these regions .",
    "the x - shooter spectrum of hd 101412 only exhibits the co @xmath0 20 and 31 bandheads , suggesting there is not sufficient energy in the origin environment to excite the higher vibrational transitions .",
    "it is not clear how our disc model would perform when attempting to fit co emission that is not from an axisymmetric disc geometry , which may explain why our reported high inclination is in contrast to the low measured @xmath95 of 8kms@xmath48 and low inclination reported in @xcite . in addition , as there is an inversely proportional degeneracy between the location of the emission and the disc inclination in our co modelling procedure , adopting a lower inclination would mean the corresponding emission region is closer to the star , likely inside the dust sublimation radius . as the inclination recovered for hd 101412 is almost exactly edge on , then the reported location of the co emission represents an upper limit to the radial distance of this region .",
    "pds 37 ( aka g282.2988@xmath9800.7769 ) was previously investigated as a massive young stellar object in @xcite , where a stellar mass , radius and effective temperature of 11.8m@xmath3 and 4.7r@xmath3 , 26100k were calculated from the bolometric luminosity and adopted for the fitting of the co emission .",

    "pds 37 is also the subject of a spectropolarimetric study by ababakr et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , where strong polarisation signatures are seen across the h@xmath104 and doubly peaked feii emission lines , indicating the presence of a gaseous disc viewed at a high inclination to the line of sight .",
    "from an initial sample of 90 targets obtained with x - shooter ( the most complete spectroscopic sample of herbig ae / be stars to date ) , we find a low detection rate of co first overtone bandhead emission of approximately 7 per cent .",
    "while a low detection rate in itself is in agreement with previous studies , our detection rate is substantially lower than studies of low mass t tauri and herbig ae stars ( 20 per cent , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also of higher mass mysos ( 17 per cent , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also striking that although our full x - shooter sample contains many a - type stars , we have only detected co overtone emission in one a - type star .",
    "in contrast to this , although our sample contains few b- and f - type stars , we have detected co in a total of 7 b - type stars and one f - type star .",
    "so , also in our sample there may be evidence that the detection rate for co first overtone emission is lower for intermediate - mass young stars than for low- and high - mass young stars .",
    "below we discuss possible explanations for this .",
    "high temperatures are required to excite the co sufficiently in order for co bandhead emission to become detectable .",
    "several of the objects in our study are b - type stars ( and hd 101412 is of type ha0 , having also been classified as b - type by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , these objects are hotter and more massive than their a - type counterparts",
    ". it could be that many t tauri and herbig ae stars are not hot enough to continually excite the co overtones in a circumstellar disc environment .",
    "in such cases , variable co emission in lower mass ysos could be explained by bursts of active accretion @xcite or by originating from a different environment ( e.g.   magnetic funnel flows , @xcite ) .",
    "however , modelling of high spectral resolution observations of a large number of t tauri stars would be required to confirm the origin of the emission .",
    "it is also possible that the majority haebes do not have enough gas in their close circumstellar environments to allow sufficient excitation of the co bandheads .",
    "in addition to high temperatures , high densities ( n @xmath8 @xmath9@xmath10 ) are required before this ro - vibrational emission becomes sufficiently excited to be detectable .",
    "while direct measurements of the amount of gas within these young stellar systems is difficult , there is evidence of cleared gaps around many haebe stars ( a recent example being hd 142527 , @xcite ) .",
    "if the gas within these inner regions is cleared efficiently , then it will not be possible to reach densities high enough to allow overtone emission to occur .",
    "our modelling of the co overtone spectra indicates the emission originates from environments with a surface density of at least @xmath105@xmath35 .",
    "in addition , @xcite present models of the inner regions of discs around haebe stars , and show that for accretion rates greater than @xmath106 , the inner gaseous disc becomes optically thick .",
    "the accretion rates determined from our analysis of the br@xmath1 in these objects are above this level , further suggesting that these objects possess a large amount of gas of a high density close to the central protostar .",
    "one unresolved issue with this interpretation is that there are a handful of objects possessing high accretion rates that do not exhibit co first overtone emission .",
    "the work of @xcite showed that co in absorption could be expected from high mass accretion rates ( observed in fu ori objects ) , however we do not detect such absorption in our observations .",
    "the location of the detected emission is of interest , as it determines which regions of the circumstellar environment can be probed .",
    "we find that four out of five of the objects possess best fitting disc models with inner radii located interior to the corresponding dust sublimation radii .",
    "this suggests that the co emission originates from a gaseous disc , close to the central protostar .",
    "the one object for which this is not the case , hd 101412 , exhibits features which are not typical when compared to the other objects studied here ( see section [ sec : hd101412 ] ) .",
    "the co - rotation radii lie between 0.020.23au , and are interior to the dust sublimation radius in all objects .",
    "the co emission is also shown to originate from beyond the co - rotation radius , in objects where @xmath107 measurements are available in the literature .",
    "therefore , our modelling suggests that while co first overtone emission is a valuable probe of the inner gaseous disc component around young stars , other spectral tracers are required to trace regions close to the co - rotation radius , where any deviations from magnetospheric accretion geometry are likely to occur .",
    "the inclinations of the best fitting disc models range from @xmath108@xmath109 , suggesting a preference for moderate to high inclinations .",
    "while the number of objects modelled in this paper is too low to accurately determine the statistical significance of this , it is nonetheless possible that a geometric selection effect is at work .",
    "one possible explanation for a preference toward more inclined discs could be that in addition to a inner disc , the co emission may also trace the vertical inner wall of the dust disc , located at the dust sublimation radius .",
    "however , further investigation using models that are able to include such emission geometry would be required to confirm this .",
    "a preference for moderate to high inclinations is in contrast to the study of co emission of massive ysos by @xcite , which found an essentially random orientation of disc inclinations .",
    "the masses of the objects studied in @xcite were determined from the bolometric luminosity of the objects , which may have included contributions from accretion , and could therefore be overestimates of the true stellar masses .",
    "in such cases , an overestimate of the stellar mass can lead to a lower inclination being recovered .",
    "this effect can be seen in our modelling of pds 37 - in this work , we recover a an inclination of 87 using a stellar mass of 7.0m@xmath3 , while in @xcite we recover an inclination of 80 from a stellar mass of 12m@xmath3 . while this effect is small , it may explain why no such preference for moderate to high inclination angles was found for mysos .",
    "a positive correlation between the line luminosities of the co bandhead and br@xmath1 is found , and while this does not imply a direct dependence ( and the number of objects with emission is too low to attribute a statistical significance to the correlation ) , it does suggest that similar factors affect the strength of both emission lines .",
    "however , analysis of the linewidths shows that the br@xmath1 emission is approximately 20 times larger than the corresponding linewidths obtained from the fitting of the co bandheads .",
    "this difference in linewidth suggests that both lines do not originate in the same kinematic environment , and are therefore likely not co - spatial .",
    "this is in contrast to the recent interferometric study of @xcite , who find a near - coincidence of co overtone , br@xmath1 and continuum emission in 5 ysos .",
    "the spectro - interferometric study of @xcite suggests two possible origins for br@xmath1 emission - compact regions , or more extended regions possibly tracing stellar or disc winds .",
    "further analysis on the precise location of the br@xmath1 emission will be required in order to study any possible connections between these two emission lines .",
    "this paper presents medium resolution vlt / x - shooter and high resolution vlt / crires near - infrared spectra of several herbig ae / be stars , in an investigation of the inner regions of their circumstellar discs .",
    "below we summarise the main findings :    * from a large spectroscopic survey of over 90 haebe targets , we detect only six objects exhibiting co first overtone bandhead emission , corresponding to a detection rate of approximately 7 per cent .",
    "analysis of the upper limits suggests that the majority of non - detections are not due to the sensitivity of the x - shooter instrument . * the objects displaying co overtone emission are mainly of spectral type b , and are thus hotter and more massive than their a - type counterparts .",
    "* in all objects that display co bandhead emission , we also find br@xmath1 emission of varying strengths .",
    "we find a positive correlation between the strength of the co @xmath0 20 bandhead and the br@xmath1 line , in agreement with previous investigations @xcite , showing this correlation extends to ysos of higher masses . *",
    "the high resolution spectra of 5 objects exhibiting co first overtone emission are fitted with a model of a thin disc undergoing keplerian rotation , and good fits are obtained to all spectra .",
    "it was determined that the spectral resolution of the x - shooter instrument was insufficient to obtain reliable model fits using this procedure . *",
    "the linewidths of the br@xmath1 emission are between 1040 times larger than the intrinsic linewidths of the co overtone emission , suggesting that they originate in different kinematic environments .",
    "* the location of the co overtone emission in these best fitting models is consistent with the hypothesis that it originates from a small scale gaseous disc , interior to the dust sublimation radius , but beyond the co - rotation radius of the central star .",
    "it is important to note that for the object where spatially resolved observations have also been performed , hd 259431 ( mwc 147 , @xcite ) , we obtain a remarkably similar value to the inclination of the disc based on our fitting technique ( @xmath110 ) . while this comparison can currently only be made in one object , it does suggest that high spectral resolution observations can be used as an alternative to interferometric observations to investigate the sub - au scale regions around young stars .",
    "we plan to investigate this with further observations using vlti / amber , which will enable direct measurements of the spatial extent of the co - emitting gas , and allow comparison with our spectral fitting technique .",
    "this , alongside more sophisticated modelling that can include the vertical structure of inner discs , will provide much information on the nature of the inner regions around herbig ae / be stars .",
