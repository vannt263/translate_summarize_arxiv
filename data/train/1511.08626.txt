    "in many biological processes such as wound healing , muscle contraction , or cytokinesis , contraction of _ actomyosin bundles _ plays a central role .",
    "actin is a polar protein that forms filaments by polymerization . if filaments of myosin ii , a motor protein , bind to two anti - parallel actin filaments with opposing plus ends ( also called _ barbed ends _ as opposed to the so - called _ pointed _ or minus ends ) , it moves along both filaments towards their respective barbed ends , thus sliding the filaments past one another and changing the length of the actomyosin ensemble @xcite .    in sarcomeres , the highly structured subunits of muscle cells ,",
    "contractility has been the focus of research for decades and is well understood by now @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of non - sarcomeric actomyosin structures ( and what the minimal requirements for contraction are ) , however , is a field of ongoing research .",
    "non - sarcomeric bundles include the contractile ring in cytokinesis @xcite , stress fibres in motile cells such as fibroblasts @xcite , or rear bundles in fish epidermal keratocytes @xcite .",
    "they typically consist of actin filaments of varying and changing lengths and of both orientations , moving relative to each other , interspersed with myosin ii filaments , cross - linkers such as @xmath0-actinin ( a protein that binds to two anti - parallel filaments @xcite ) , and fascin ( which connects actin filaments of the same orientation @xcite ) .",
    "length changes are typically due to depolymerization",
    ".    a one - dimensional model for the dynamics of such disordered actomyosin bundles has been derived by the second author @xcite , taking into account the aforementioned protein dynamics ( for details and an overview of other modelling approaches see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "its derivation starts on a microscopic level and describes each actin filament by the movement of its plus and minus ends .",
    "a force - balance equation accounts for the influences of myosin , of cross - linking , and possibly of external forces ( e.g. due to linkages to the substrate ) . assuming that proteins act as transient elastic springs that bind and unbind in the overlapping region of filaments , an average over these effects can be described by friction @xcite .",
    "an effective interaction coefficient between two filaments is derived , where the length of the overlap is modified by a factor reducing the interaction probability in thick bundles .",
    "a continuous description is introduced by replacing individual filaments by a position ( of the filament center of gravity ) and length dependent density function .",
    "the force - balance equation now becomes an integral equation , where the effective interaction coefficient involves integrals over all the actin material within the overlapping region .",
    "a significant simplification of the model is achieved by the assumption that individual filaments are short compared to the length of the bundle . in the corresponding asymptotic limit the force balance equations are localized and turn into two coupled elliptic equations for the quasistationary velocities of left- and right - moving filaments .",
    "the effective interaction coefficients now depend on moments of the actin densities with respect to filament length . on the other hand , the velocities appear in transport equations for the densities .",
    "this derivation of the model does not consider ends of the bundle .",
    "considering the model for a bundle of finite , time - dependent length , two - point boundary conditions for the velocities and inflow boundary conditions for the densities are needed .",
    "two choices seem natural : if the total force acting at the ends of the bundle is prescribed , its length has to be treated as an unknown , resulting in a free boundary problem .",
    "if , on the other hand , the dynamics of the bundle length is prescribed , the applied force can be computed as post - processing .",
    "these scenarios consider the force - velocity relationship of the contractile bundle either as a function of force or of contraction rate , respectively .",
    "the aim of this study is to examine the solvability of both problems .",
    "we shall first introduce the mathematical model in section [ mathmodel ] , then transform both problems to a fixed boundary by a coordinate transform in section [ assumstrat ] , where we also specify reqirements on initial and boundary data .",
    "furthermore we explicitly solve the problem for the case , where no forces act on the tips .",
    "in section [ fbvp ] , the free boundary problem with prescribed force is considered . since in general",
    "there is no control of the bundle length , solutions can only be expected to exist locally in time .",
    "the solution behaviour necessary for the well posedness of the initial - boundary value problem can only be expected for small enough forces .",
    "we therefore prove a local - in - time existence and uniqueness result under the assumption of a small force . in section [ fxbvp ] ,",
    "the problem corresponding to the situation with prescribed bundle length is treated .",
    "a local existence and uniqueness result can be shown , which is very similar to the free boundary problem . under the additional assumption of small enough bundle length solutions",
    "are proven to exist globally .",
    "the local existence results are proven by decoupling the problems for the filament densities and for the velocities and by an analysis of the resulting fixed point operator .",
    "the main difficulty is to avoid the occurrence of regions , where all filaments of one of the two families are completely decomposed .",
    "this definitely happens after some time , if the bundle becomes too long , which explains the shortness assumption for the global existence result .",
    "finally , in section 6 we return to the problem with prescribed force and investigate a situation , where global existence can be expected . for small force and bundle length and for time independent boundary data , a formal approximation of the solution can be computed explicitly . under the assumption of a contractive bundle and a pulling force , convergence to a steady state with finite bundle length",
    "is obtained .",
    "let the bundle at time @xmath1 be located in the @xmath2-interval @xmath3 $ ] , and let @xmath4 and , respectively , @xmath5 be the densities of actin filaments ( with their pointed ends directed in the positive and , respectively , the negative @xmath2 direction ) with respect to their centers @xmath6 $ ] and to their lengths @xmath7 .",
    "note that this is a two - scale model , where the length variables @xmath2 and @xmath8 vary on different scales . by @xmath9",
    "we denote the velocities of the filaments centered at @xmath2 ( independent of filament length because of the strong friction between co - localized filaments of the same family ) , and by the given constant @xmath10 the difference between the depolymerization and the polymerization speeds , i.e. depolymerization dominates and filaments become shorter with time .    by actin - myosin interaction , the plus - filaments",
    "are expected to move to the right relative to the minus - filaments . concerning the ends of the bundle",
    ", we want to describe a situation , where plus - filaments enter the bundle from the left end and leave it at the right end , and vice versa for the minus - filaments , meaning @xmath11 this will be a consequence of assumptions on the data formulated below . if it holds , the following initial - boundary value problem for the densities can be expected to be well posed for given @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath14 where the boundary data @xmath15 , @xmath16 and initial data @xmath17 are given .",
    "this subproblem is coupled to the problem for the velocities : @xmath18 where the differential equation is a force balance , with the first term ( reminiscent of the viscous term in fluid models ) describing friction caused by filaments of the same family as a consequence of the building and breaking dynamics of connections by bundling proteins .",
    "the second term models the interactions between the two families with the contributions @xmath19 from actin - myosin interaction and @xmath20 from the cross - linking of antiparallel filaments .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 measures the strength of the actin - myosin interaction relative to the cross - linking , and the viscosity coefficients and the interaction strength coefficient between antiparallel filaments are given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "note that both coefficients increase only linearly ( instead of quadratically ) with the local total filament length , taking into account that in a thick bundle interaction between two filaments becomes less likely .",
    "plus - filaments are pushed into the bundle at @xmath24 with speed @xmath25 , and minus - filaments at @xmath26 with ( relative ) speed @xmath27 .",
    "the absence of forces on the plus - filaments at @xmath26 and on the minus - filaments at @xmath24 are described by the homogeneous neumann boundary conditions .    adding the differential equations in shows that the quantity @xmath28 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "it can be interpreted as the total force acting on the ends of the bundle , pulling it apart when positive . in the following , two different situations will be considered . on the one hand , for given bundle length @xmath29 , , ,",
    "is a closed system for the computation of @xmath30 , and the computation of the force can be considered as post - processing . on the other hand ,",
    "the force @xmath31 may be considered as given , and the bundle length @xmath13 as an unknown . in this case",
    "provides an additional equation for the determination of the free boundary @xmath13 , and its initial position @xmath32 has to be prescribed .",
    "in this section , our strategy for proving well posedness of the free boundary problem  for the determination of @xmath33 will be presented .",
    "it will be carried out in detail in the following section .",
    "the last section will be concerned with the simpler proofs for the case with prescribed bundle length , where only the main differences will be highlighted .    as a preliminary step ,",
