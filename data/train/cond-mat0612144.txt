    "the transverse axial next - nearest neighbour ising ( annni ) model is one of the simplest ising models that contains tunable frustration and tunable quantum fluctuation . in one dimension ,",
    "it is defined ( for spin=@xmath5 ) by the hamiltonian @xcite = - j _",
    "j=1^n ( s^z_j s^z_j+1 - s^z_j s^z_j+2 ) - _ j=1^n s^x_j here the first term describes a ferromagnetic nearest - neighbour interaction of strength @xmath6(@xmath7 ) between longitudinal components of spin @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , the second term describes an antiferromagnetic second neighbour interaction of strength @xmath10 also in the longitudinal direction , and the third term describes an external field in the transverse direction of strength @xmath1 .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) is called the frustration parameter .",
    "this hamiltonian describes a classical annni chain subjected to a transverse field as well as a transverse ( nearest - neighbour ) ising model with an additional frustrated second nearest - neighbour interaction . in this paper",
    ", we shall deal with the _ ground state _",
    "( zero - temperature ) phase diagram of the hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "it is known @xcite that for @xmath12 ( only nearest - neighbour interaction ) , there is a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic second order phase transition at @xmath13 . on the other hand , for @xmath3 ( classical annni chain ) @xcite",
    "the ground state is ferromagnetic for @xmath14 and antiphase ( @xmath15 type ) for @xmath16 , with a ` multiphase point ' at @xmath17 . at the multiphase point @xcite the ground - state has very high ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the golden ratio @xmath20 ) degeneracy as any combination of antiphase and ferromagnetic patches will serve as ground state configuration . from approximate analytic and numerical approaches @xcite ,",
    "early studies had proposed a phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ) that consists of ferromagnetic , paramagnetic and antiphase regions , alongwith a region of what is called _ floating phase_. the @xmath21 neighbour spin - spin correlation function in the longitudinal direction c^z(n ) -",
    "< s^z_j>^2 decays exponentially with distance in the ferromagnetic , antiphase and paramagnetic regions but decays algebraically in the floating phase .",
    "the evidence for the presence of floating phase is provided by quantum monte carlo simulation @xcite and by exact numerical diagonalisation of small systems @xcite , one of which @xcite extends even upto a length of 32 .",
    "recently , a question has arisen on the existence of the floating phase , as a recent study @xcite has claimed that the floating phase exists only within a strip of infinitesimally small width .",
    "the transverse annni chain is related to the two - dimensional classical annni model by suzuki - trotter transformation .",
    "the phase diagram for this model is also similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ( with @xmath1 replaced by temperature ) . here also the earlier studies @xcite support the existence of floating phase in view of monte carlo simulations by selke and others @xcite and approximate analytic calculations by villain and bak @xcite , while a recent measurement of dynamical exponent @xcite and a density matrix renormalisation group analysis @xcite claim that the floating phase exists , if at all , along a line only .",
    "we have also studied @xcite some static and dynamical properties of the 2d annni model by monte carlo simulation .",
    "our study also indicates that the floating phase exists , if at all , only along a line .",
    "the question is to whether the floating phase exists only along a line or extends over a region in the case of transverse annni chain is the basic motivation of this paper .    in this paper",
    "we perform two perturbation calculations with an aim to have an idea about the phase that exists near the multiphase point for non - zero transverse field .",
    "our conclusion is that there exists floating phase over a region extending from ferromagnetic phase to antiphase ( for small values of @xmath1 ) and the phase diagram looks like fig .",
    "[ fig : phase2 ] .",
    "this result is in contradiction with previous results as none of the previous studies had predicted floating phase for @xmath14 . we must mention that all our results are true only at `` small '' values of @xmath1 and the quantitative details of this diagram is not reliable at @xmath22",
    "however , the topological structure of the diagram should be correct .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in sections",
    "ii and iii , the first and the second perturbation schemes will be presented ( respectively ) and we shall conclude with some discussions in sec .",
    "we shall now present a first order perturbation calculation around @xmath2 by rewriting the hamiltonian @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( 1 ) as @xmath24 where _ cl = - j_j [ s^z_j s^z_j+1 - s^z_j s^z_j+2 ] and _ p = _ j with @xmath25",
    ". we always take @xmath1 to be positive , so that negative values of @xmath26 imply @xmath14 .",
    "we shall treat the @xmath27 as a perturbation over @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , @xmath28 is the longitudinal ( classical ) part of @xmath11 at @xmath2 and @xmath27 includes the transverse part and an increase of @xmath0 ( from 0.5 ) by an amount @xmath29 .",
    "one must note that for a perturbative treatment @xmath1 has to be small but @xmath26 need not be so . in the @xmath30 phase space ,",
    "the perturbation takes us from the multiphase point ( 0.5 , 0 ) to a point ( 0.5 + @xmath29 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "as @xmath26 varies from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , the perturbation takes us from the ferromagnetic to the antiphase region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] ) . the first order correction ( @xmath33 ) to ground state energy can be calculated _",
    "exactly_. this quantity is studied as a function of @xmath26 , because if there is a non - analyticity at @xmath34 , then there will be a phase transition line emanating from the ( 0.5 , 0 ) point at an angle @xmath35 with the increasing @xmath0 direction .",
    "it is found that @xmath33 as a function of @xmath26 is non - analytic only at @xmath36 and 1 .",
    "therefore , only two lines of phase transition meet at the multiphase point .",
    "this implies either that the floating - paramagnetic transition line touches tangentially the floating - antiphase line at this point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase3 ] ) or that the floating phase extends over the entire region from antiphase to ferromagnetic region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase2 ] ) .",
    "it will be shown that a study of susceptibility and mass - gap rules out the possibility of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase3 ] and points to the validity of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase2 ] .",
    "thus , the final conclusion from the first perturbation scheme is that the boundary between the ferromagnetic ( antiphase ) and the floating phase emanates from the multiphase point at an angle @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) with the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the second perturbation scheme also supports this conclusion and additionally enables us to obtain an approximate phase diagram .",
    "we shall now transform our problem to a certain problem for the nearest neighbour transverse ising model and then through a study of the nearest neighbour model , obtain the expression for @xmath33 .",
    "we start by noting that at @xmath2 ( the ` multiphase point ' @xcite ) the ground state of @xmath28 , the unperturbed hamiltonian , is a highly degenerate state and any spin configuration that has no spin - domain of length unity ( i.e. no @xmath39 or @xmath40 type arrangement ) can be the ground state .",
    "the number of domain walls is immaterial and can be anything between 0 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the total number of spins .",
    "( of course , for periodic boundary there can be only an even number of walls . )",
    "let us denote the set of all such configurations as @xmath43 .",
    "also , let the population of this set be @xmath44 which incidentally is of the order of @xmath45 as mentioned in sec .",
    "i @xcite . now , the first - order correction to the eigenvalue are the eigenvalues of the @xmath46 matrix @xmath47 , whose elements are @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are configurations within @xmath43",
    ". the matrix @xmath47 can be easily given a block diagonal structure .",
    "note that @xmath51 if and only if the @xmath52-th spin lies at the _ boundary _ of a domain , and the domain too has length larger than 2 . also , in such a case , @xmath53 operating on @xmath54 will translate the wall at the left ( right ) of the @xmath52-th site by one lattice spacing to the right ( left ) .",
    "this immediately leads us to the important conclusion that @xmath55 if and only if @xmath56 and @xmath54 have equal number of domain walls .",
    "thus , we can break up @xmath43 into subsets @xmath57 , where @xmath57 contains all possible spin distributions with @xmath58 walls ( @xmath58 = 2 , 4 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "now , the @xmath46 matrix @xmath47 gets block - diagonalised into matrices of size @xmath60 , p_(w ) | h_p | where @xmath61 is the population of @xmath57 and @xmath62 .",
    "we now observe that the longitudinal term in @xmath27 only contributes a diagonal term @xmath63 to @xmath64 , so that one can write p(w ) = m(w ) + r(n-4w)*1*. here @xmath65 is the @xmath60 unit matrix , @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the transverse part of @xmath27 .",
    "thus the non - trivial problem is to solve the eigenproblem of @xmath68 .    to proceed with the matrices @xmath68 ,",
    "let us construct from each member @xmath49 of @xmath57 a configuration @xmath69 by removing one spin from each domain .",
    "the total number of spins in @xmath69 will obviously be @xmath70 , say .",
    "such a transformation was also used by villain and bak @xcite for the case of two - dimensional annni model .",
    "the set @xmath71 composed of the states @xmath69 is then nothing but the set of all possible distributions of @xmath72 spins with @xmath58 walls , with no restriction on the domains of length unity .",
    "it is easily seen that the matrix latexmath:[\\[m^{\\prime}_{\\alpha \\beta}(w ) \\equiv",
    "\\langle \\alpha^{\\prime } | { \\mathcal h}_q     @xmath68 since the element @xmath74 becomes simple once we we observe that @xmath71 is nothing but the set of degenerate eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath75 corresponding to the eigenvalue e_w = - j ( n^ - 2w ) .",
    "thus , if we perturb @xmath76 by @xmath77 , then the first - order perturbation matrix will assume a block diagonal form made up of the matrices @xmath78 for all possible values of @xmath58 .",
    "to solve the perturbation problem for @xmath79 , we note that this hamiltonian is the same as @xmath11 of eq .",

    "the exact solution for this hamiltonian is readily available @xcite .",
    "the exact expression for the energy eigenstates are ( for periodic chain in the thermodynamic limit @xcite ) , e= 2 _ k _ k _ k where @xmath82 may be 0 , @xmath831 and @xmath84 runs over @xmath85 equispaced values in the interval 0 to @xmath86 . also",

    ", the energy @xmath91 must be the same as @xmath92 of eq.(7 ) , so that 2 _ k=0^ _ k = - ( n^ - 2w ) .",
    "clearly , the different values of the quantity @xmath93 correspond to the first order perturbation corrections to the different levels .",
    "they are therefore also the eigenvalues of the @xmath94 matrix .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath95 of eq.(6 ) are e_p = r(n-4w ) + 2_k=0^ _ k k keeping @xmath42 fixed we have to find , for which value of @xmath58 and for which distribution of @xmath82 , @xmath96 is minimum subject to the constraint ( 9 ) . for a given value of @xmath97 , this minimisation is achieved if -1 values of @xmath82 accumulate near @xmath98 and + 1 values near @xmath99 .",

    "let us call the eigenstate of @xmath79 corresponding to @xmath113 as @xmath114 .",

    "of course , for large values of @xmath1 the perturbation corrections may cancel the divergence of susceptibility and lead to a paramagnetic state",

    "hence , the correlation @xmath179 in @xmath176 will be zero and @xmath180 in @xmath176 will be the same as the nearest - neighbour correlation in the constituent chains @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "( indeed , @xmath177 and @xmath178 will be uncorrelated because , any configuration of @xmath177 will couple with equal probability to two configurations of @xmath178 , one of which can be obtained from the other by reversing all spins . )",
    "moreover , since each of the antiferromagnetic chains can be transformed to a ferromagnetic chain ( @xmath181 , say ) by simply reversing the alternate spins , the eigenstates of @xmath182 in @xmath176 are related to the eigenstates of a nearest - neighbour ferromagnetic transverse ising chain @xmath181 .",

    "[ fig : new1 ] ) . as in the previous subsection",
    ", we look for the eigenstate , ( i.e. the @xmath82 distribution ) for which @xmath186 will be lowest and observe that @xmath158 will be largest when the @xmath159 values of @xmath82 accumulate near @xmath98 and @xmath160 values near @xmath99 . also , investigating all the states for a chain of only 12 spins , we find that the minimum value of @xmath186 corresponds to the distribution with no zero values of @xmath82 .",
    "thus , assuming the distribution of eq .",
    "( 25 ) , we can find numerically the value of @xmath101 ( say , @xmath103 ) for which @xmath186 will be lowest for a chain of 1000 spins .",
    "it is found that this minimum correponds to a non - zero value of @xmath187 , indicating that as for @xmath14 , the unperturbed state corresponding to the ground state is an excited state of @xmath146 .",
    "as in the previous subsection , we can use the expression for @xmath169 mentioned in the appendix b as the correlation in the chain @xmath181 . the corresponding spin - spin correlation in the annni chain @xmath176",
    "will be @xmath188 in this expression , the @xmath189 factor takes account of the mapping between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains .",
    "the final result is as follows . for @xmath170 ,",
    "that is , @xmath190 , the value of @xmath103 turns out to be @xmath86 , so that the correlation in the chain @xmath181 is constant and the correlation @xmath191 corresponds to a perfect antiphase . for @xmath171 ,",
    "that is , @xmath192 , there are two regions . in one region @xmath173 and",
    "according to appendix b , the correlation is c^z_a(n ) = a(_0 ) ( ) indicating a floating phase with index 0.5 and modulation @xmath193 the parameter @xmath103 varies continuously as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kgt5.phi0 ] ) , but this variation affects only the amplitude @xmath128 . in the other region , @xmath175 , and the correlation in @xmath181 is exponentially decaying , indicating a paramagnetic phase with the same modulation . the values of @xmath89 and @xmath103 and the corresponding phases in different portions of the phase diagram is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : new2 ] and the resulting phase diagram is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] , which agrees with the conclusions from our first perturbation scheme .",
    "in this section we shall point out some features of the phase diagram we have obtained .",
    "\\(1 ) in the floating phase ( @xmath194 ) the spin - spin correlation decays as @xmath195 with @xmath196 = 0.5 .",
    "it is interesting to note that on the boundary between the floating and the ordered ( ferromagnetic or antiphase ) state @xmath89 is 1 and @xmath103 is 0 or @xmath86 and the correlation decays algebraically with @xmath196 = 0.25 as shown by pfeuty @xcite .",
    "thus , the value of the index undergoes a non - analytic change at the boundary .",
    "\\(2 ) in the floating phase , the correlation is non - oscillatory ( @xmath197 ) for @xmath14 and oscillatory ( @xmath198 ) for @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the line @xmath2 is the `` disorder line '' @xcite across which the modulation wavevector suffers a sudden change from 0 to @xmath199 .",
    "we have also measured the perturbed energy @xmath200 and @xmath201 on two sides of the disorder line for a given @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ground ] ) .",
    "this energy remains continuous but suffers a change of slope at @xmath17 .",
    "since the first perturbation scheme does not indicate any phase transition around @xmath17 , we guess that this change of slope is not the signature of any serious non - analytic behaviour but is only an outcome of the approximation inherent in perturbation calculation .",
    "\\(3 ) within the floating phase , for @xmath16 , the nearest - neighbour correlation is zero ( eq .",
    "( 28 ) ) and the wave - vector is @xmath198 , implying that the wave number @xmath202 is equal to the number of domain walls per site . on the other hand , for @xmath14 ,",
    "the nearest - neighbour correlation is not at all zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nncorr ] ) , but the correlation is non - oscillatory ( @xmath197 ) , implying that the wave number @xmath202 is _ not _ equal to the number of domain walls per site .",
    "one must note that ( as mentioned above ) , the analytic treatments of villain and bak @xcite , and of uimin and rieger @xcite assumes the equality of the wave - number and the number of domain walls per site .",
    "this assumption thus agrees with our results for @xmath16 but not for @xmath203 .",
    "\\(4 ) the second perturbative scheme would be reliable only when the ratio @xmath204 or @xmath205 ( accordingly as @xmath0 is @xmath144 or @xmath206 ) is small .",
    "we have included in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] only those points where this ratio is less than some arbitrarily chosen number 1/3 .",
    "this criterion made us unable to locate the boundary between the paramagnetic and floating phase near @xmath17 , @xmath207 resulting in a gap there in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] .",
    "some better approximation is needed to bridge this gap .",
    "\\(5 ) the first and second perturbation schemes can be compared and reconciled in the following way .",
    "for the first perturbation scheme , the unperturbed hamiltonian corresponds to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 point , and the exact expressions for the first order correction to energy gives exactly the directions along which the boundaries of ferromagnetic phase and antiphase emanate from this point ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . on the other hand , for the second perturbation scheme",
    ", the unperturbed hamiltonian corresponds to the boundary lines of the ferromagnetic phase and the antiphase since on these lines @xmath145 and @xmath187 are zero .",
    "the approximate estimate of the first order correction to energy gives the nature of the phase near the boundary .",
    "however , since the estimate is only approximate , at some regions of the parameter space , it is not reliable ( as explained above ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge the encouragement and fruitful discussions with p. sen , m. barma and b. k. chakrabarti .",
    "the possibility of fig .",
    "4 was pointed out by m. saha .",
    "the work of one author ( akc ) was supported by ugc fellowship .",
    "we acknowledge the financial support from dst - fist for computational facility .",
    "+        we have derived earlier an expression @xmath208 for the first order correction to the ground state energy of the hamiltonian ( see eq .",

( 4 ) ) @xmath210.\\ ] ] in this appendix we shall show by the method of induction , that for all values of @xmath103 in the range @xmath126 , all higher derivatives of this quantity @xmath33 remain finite . for this purpose , we note that the first and second order derivatives are : @xmath211 and @xmath212 here we have used the equality @xmath213 which can be obtained from eq .",
    "thus , at least for @xmath214 and 2 the derivatives can be expressed in the form = -n_i=1^m^ k_i where @xmath215 , and @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 are constants @xmath220 with the restriction @xmath221 ( except for @xmath222 , where @xmath223 ) . differentiating eq.(29 ) once , it can be easily verified that the form ( 29 ) should be valid for @xmath224 also , and is hence valid for all values of @xmath225 .",
    "since the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 29 ) diverges only when @xmath226 vanishes , we conclude that so long as @xmath103 is neither 0 or @xmath86 the higher derivatives of @xmath33 remain finite . +        here we shall consider transverse ising model with nearest neighbour interaction described by the hamiltonian ^ti = - _ j=1^n [ j s^z_j s^z_j+1 + s^x_j ] .the exact solution @xcite for this hamiltonian tells us that the @xmath163 number of energy eigenvalues are e= 2 _ k _ k _ k where @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath82 may be 0 , @xmath831 and @xmath84 runs over @xmath41 equispaced values in the interval 0 to @xmath86 .        .",
    "this is an excited state and reduces to the ground state only for @xmath229 .",
    "this state is important for this work because it corresponds to the ground state after perturbation in the second perturbation scheme ( eq .",
    ". it also corresponds to the first order correction in the first perturbation scheme ( eq . ( 11 ) ) .",
    "we shall present in this appendix the expressions for the longitudinal two - spin correlation function c^z(n ) - < s^z_j>^2 ( for @xmath230 ) in the long - range limit @xmath231 .",
    "let us consider the quantity , ^z(n ) remembering that , @xmath232 standard treatise @xcite show that for @xmath233 ( no excited state ) , this quantity is of the following form . for @xmath170 , @xmath234 ( @xmath128 , @xmath235 are constants depending on @xmath89 . )",
    "this corresponds to ferromagnetic state . for @xmath194 , @xmath236 ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 are constants depending on @xmath89",

    "there is a non - analyticity at the point @xmath239 where the second derivative of ground - state energy diverges .",
