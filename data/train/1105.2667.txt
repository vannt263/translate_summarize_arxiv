    "mt graham international observatory is located in south - eastern arizona , usa , at 3200 m above sea level .",
    "the observatory consists of three telescopes : the large binocular telescope ( lbt - with two 8.4 m mirrors ) , the heinrich hertz sub - millimetre telescope ( smt - d=10 m ) and the vatican advanced technology telescope ( vatt - d=1.83 m ) .",
    "some studies aiming to characterize the optical turbulence above mt graham have been done in the past with measurements mainly retrieved from a generalized scidar ( gs ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility to characterize and predict the optical turbulence ( vertical distribution and integrated values ) at mt graham using an atmospheric mesoscale model called meso - nh . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have used the same model to investigate the possibility to predict the vertical wind speed distribution at mt graham .",
    "we proved that the meso - nh model provides reliable estimates of the vertical distribution of the wind speed at all heights from the ground up to 20 km .",
    "this wind speed can be used therefore for the calculation of the wavefront coherence time ( @xmath3 ) on the mt graham summit .",
    "the meso - nh model has already been used to study the optical turbulence ( ot ) at different astronomical sites .",
    "it was first used by @xcite who also developed the code for the optical turbulence in the meso - nh , the so called astro - meso - nh package including the algorithms for the @xmath0 parametrization .",
    "these were , to our knowledge , the first @xmath0-profiles ever simulated with a mesoscale model in an astronomical context . in those studies",
    "the model was proved to be sensitive to orographic effects and to be able to reconstruct @xmath0-profiles well correlated to measurements provided by a scidar .",
    "also it was able to discriminate between the worst and the best seeing of the measurement campaign .",
    "@xcite discussed the main limitations encountered in the @xmath0 modelling and proposed methods to overcome them .",
    "some improvements in the model reliability have been achieved more recently thanks to the method for the model calibration introduced by @xcite .",
    "such a calibration reduces some systematic errors and it is based on the tuning of a free parameter called minimum turbulence kinetic energy ( e@xmath4 ) .",
    "the authors proved that the @xmath0 can be related to e@xmath4 and the calibration aims to fix the value of e@xmath4 using as a reference the measured @xmath0-profiles .",
    "@xcite proved that the calibrated meso - nh model reduced some of the previous systematic errors in the model and the shape of the resulting @xmath0-profiles fitted better with measurements than the uncalibrated model .",
    "the statistic reliability of this method has been proved only later by @xcite who used the calibrated meso - nh to simulate the optical turbulence at the san pedro mrtir observatory on a sample of 10 nights , for which there were @xmath0-profiles obtained with a generalized scidar and micro - thermal sensors mounted on radiosondes .",
    "measurements provided by different instruments permitted the authors to prove that the dispersion between measurements and simulations was of the same order as the dispersion between measurements provided by different instruments .",
    "this qualified the numerical technique and the meso - nh model as potentially useful to perform autonomous estimates of the optical turbulence .",
    "more recently @xcite the meso - nh has been used in an autonomous way ( after calibration ) on a sample of 80 nights to simulate the optical turbulence at san pedro mrtir .",
    "the algorithms for the optical turbulence parametrization introduced by @xcite as well as the calibration procedure @xcite have been later on implemented in other mesoscale models such as wrf @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use the meso - nh model to simulate the optical turbulence at mt graham using , as a reference , a sample of measurements associated to 43 nights .",
    "a sub - sample of this rich statistical sample is used to calibrate the model .",
    "the outputs of the model are then compared to measurements obtained with a generalized scidar @xcite .",
    "the sample of measurements is around four times larger than the previous samples @xcite and the largest ever used at present for this purpose .",
    "for this reason we can : * ( 1 ) * verify if the calibration permits the model to still obtain a typical vertical distribution well correlated with measurements and/or if this correlation increases / decreases ; * ( 2 ) * study how the correlation between numerical calculations and measurements is deteriorated when we consider in the sample data not used for the calibration ; * ( 3 ) * study the ability of the meso - nh model in reproducing the seasonal differences in the optical turbulence .",
    "the measurements are , indeed , quite evenly distributed over different periods . in this paper",
    "we also test a variant of the method of model calibration proposed by @xcite , hereafter mj01 .    in section [ sec : meas ] we briefly present the measurements used as a reference in this study . in section [ sec : mnh ]",
    "we present the meso - nh model and describe the model configuration used in this study . in section [ sec : calib ]",
    "we describe the calibration procedure . in section [ sec : res ]",
    "we present the results of this study in four subsection dedicated respectively to the vertical distribution of the optical turbulence ( @xmath0-profiles ) , the seeing @xmath1 , the isoplanatic angle @xmath2 and the wavefront coherence time @xmath3 . in section [ sec : concl ] the conclusions of this study are presented .",
    "@xmath0 profiles obtained with a generalized scidar ( gs ) @xcite mounted on the vatt have been used as a reference for this study .",
    "the gs is based on the observation of binaries with a typical separation @xmath5 within ( 3 - 10 ) arcsec , the binary magnitude m@xmath6,m@xmath7 @xmath8 5 mag and @xmath9(m@xmath10 ) @xmath8 1 mag .",
    "the gs needs a telescope with a pupil size @xmath11 1.5 m. the @xmath0-profiles are obtained from the inversion of the auto - correlation of the scintillation map of binaries @xcite .",
    "this instruments provides a vertical distribution of the optical turbulence on the whole 20 km from the ground with a vertical resolution that scales as @xmath12 / @xmath5 where @xmath13 is the height from the ground and h@xmath14 is the height under ground at which the conjugated plane is optically placed .",
    "the gs provides a vertical resolution that , considering the parameter space just described , is typically of the order of 1 km on the whole atmosphere , reaching the best resolution near the ground ( order of some hundreds of meters ) .",
    "gs measurements are the best choice ( with respect to other vertical profilers ) for a mesoscale model validation for a few reasons : ( 1 ) measurements are obtained with a remote sensing technique and they are therefore available for an extended period of time during a night , ( 2 ) the @xmath0 is obtained with a completely independent and auto - consistent method requiring no calibration ( 3 ) one can access directly the @xmath0 i.e. the prime element from which all the integrated astroclimatic parameters can be calculated autonomously .",
    "appendix a reports the analytical equations that describe how the seeing , the isoplanatic angle and the wavefront coherence time are calculated from the @xmath0 .",
    "the meso - nh is a non - hydrostatic mesoscale model developed jointly by the centre national des recherches mtorologiques ( cnrm - mto - france ) and laboratoire darologie in toulouse ( france ) @xcite .",
    "it is a grid point model based on the anelastic approximation to efficiently filter out the acoustic waves .",
    "a @xcite coordinate on the vertical and a c - grid in the formulation of @xcite for the spatial digitalization is used .",
    "the temporal scheme is an explicit three - time - level leap - frog scheme with a time filter @xcite .",
    "the turbulent scheme is a one - dimensional 1.5 closure scheme @xcite .",
    "the model permits the use of different mixing lengths . in this paper",
    "we used the 1-d @xcite mixing length ( bl89 ) .",
    "the surface exchanges are computed in an externalized surface scheme ( surfex ) including the physical package isba ( interactions soil biosphere atmosphere ) @xcite that controls the air / ground turbulent fluxes budget of meso - nh .",
    "the model can simulate the temporal evolution in three dimensions of the classical meteorological parameters , such as wind speed and direction , potential temperature , pressure , and so on .",
    "meso - nh uses the code implemented by @xcite to forecast the optical turbulence ( @xmath15 3d maps ) and all the astroclimatic parameters deduced from the @xmath15",
    ". we will refer to the astro - meso - nh code to indicate this package .",
    "the integrated astroclimatic parameters are calculated integrating the @xmath15 with respect to the zenith in the astro - meso - nh code .",
    "the meso - nh model is run , in this paper , in a grid nesting mode using three imbricated models with different resolutions ( table [ res ] ) .",
    "they are all centred on the mt graham observatory ( 32.7013@xmath16n , 109.8919@xmath16w ) .",

    "this is not univocal .",
    "as an example , fig .  [ cn2_mean_med ] shows , for a pedagogic approach , four @xmath0-profiles calculated from the sample of observed @xmath0-profiles : ( i ) the median of all the individual @xmath0-profiles of the whole sample of 41 nights ( 15956 profiles ) ( red line ) ; ( ii ) the median of the 41 @xmath0-profiles associated to each night .",
    "each @xmath0-profile is obtained averaging the @xmath0 of a night ( green line ) ; ( iii ) the mean of all the individual @xmath0-profiles ( 15956 profiles ) of the whole sample of 41 nights ( light blue line ) ; ( iv ) the average of the 41 @xmath0-profiles associated to each night .",
    "each @xmath0-profile is obtained averaging the @xmath0 of a night ( dark blue line ) .",
    "the difference between these @xmath0-profiles tells us that , depending on how we treat statistically the data we obtain different results . in studies on site characterization done with measurements taken with monitors",
    "approach ( i ) is frequently used .",
    "our context , however , is different .",
    "as we said , it is hard to predict a @xmath0 at a precise time ( t = t@xmath23 ) of the night and , at present , to investigate quantitatively the performances of the model our goal is to associate the average of the @xmath0-profiles simulated during one night with the average of the measured @xmath0-profiles of the same night .",
    "for this reason we are forced to eliminate the approach ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "moreover the calibration is based basically on the fitting of the average of m @xmath0-profiles ( m is the number of nights ) .",
    "we selected therefore the criterion ( iv ) and we considered the mean as a statistical operator to quantify the model performances of the @xmath0 .",
    "this is the same approach used in @xcite . for homogeneity we considered the same criterion with the integrated astroclimatic parameters ( seeing , isoplanatic angle and wavefront coherence time ) .",
    "figure  [ cn2_34 ] shows the average of the @xmath0-profiles measured with the generalized scidar and simulated with the calibrated model with the methods mj01 and mj01@xmath23 . in the same picture",
    "is reported also the average @xmath0 before the calibration as well as those calculated in the two seasons : summer and winter .",
    "figure  [ cn2_41 ] shows the same for the 41 nights .",
    "the agreement between the morphology ( shape ) of the averaged @xmath0-profiles measured by the generalized scidar ( red lines ) and calculated with the meso - nh ( light blue lines : mj01 ; dark blue lines : mj01@xmath23 ) is very good when looking at the average of all the 34 nights ( fig .",
    "[ cn2_34]-left ) .",
    "the model can reconstruct all the major typical features of the @xmath0-profile such as the position ( at @xmath18 10 km ) and shape of the secondary peak . between 4 and 8 km above the ground the mj01@xmath23 method seems slightly better than the mj01 method .",
    "the vertical distribution of the optical turbulence in the winter ( fig .",
    "[ cn2_34 ] - right ) is also very well described by the meso - nh model . however in summer ( fig .",
    "[ cn2_34 ] - centre ) the model seems to overestimate the @xmath0 in the free atmosphere .",
    "however , the mj01 method is better than the mj01@xmath23 method .",
    "the mj01 method is indeed well correlated to measurements up to around 8 km from the ground while the mj01@xmath23 method overestimates the @xmath0 starting from 4 km from the ground .",
    "the _ @xmath24 effect _ @xcite is well reconstructed by the model too : in summer the secondary peak shifts to a higher altitude as shown by the measurements . at the same time",
    "the strength of the secondary peak slightly decreases as observed in measurements .",
    "no major differences are appreciated in the shape of the averaged @xmath0-profiles between the calibration case ( 34 nights ) and the whole sample ( 41 nights ) .",
    "therefore the inclusion in the sample of some more nights does not seem to produce a major impact on the morphology ( shape ) of the averaged @xmath0-profile . which is the cause of the model overestimate of the @xmath0 in the free atmosphere in summer",
    "? looking at fig .",
    "[ av_cn2_minmax ] we note that , in the free atmosphere , the model variation between the minimum and the maximum values of @xmath0 is substantially smaller than what observed with measurements .",
    "the higher the altitude , the higher is the model inertia and , as a consequence , the model has more difficulties in reconstructing the extreme values ( minimum and maximum ) in the high part of the atmosphere .",
    "one could expect therefore a slight underestimate of the model in winter and a slight overestimate in summer .",
    "the fact that a model overestimate is observed only in summer can be due to the fact that , in this season the number of nights for the 34 and 41 nights samples are , respectively , 14 and 15 nights while in winter we have 20 and 26 nights respectively .",
    "it is therefore possible that the winter data got a more important weight in the calibration .",
    "also in summer we got all nights with extremely weak turbulence in the free atmosphere . with a richer and more homogeneous statistical sample",
    "we should therefore expect a decreasing in strength of the discrepancy and a more symmetric discrepancy with respect to the two seasons .",
    "we do not think that there is a specific problem for the summer period .",
    "nevertheless it is a fact that the model variability needs to be improved in the high part of the atmosphere to be able to well detect all the cases of very strong as well as very weak turbulence conditions .",
    "we are working at present on this topic .",
    "the seeing depends on the @xmath0 as eq.[epsi ] in appendix a. figure  [ see_fig ] shows the total seeing ( @xmath19 ) , the boundary layer ( @xmath20 ) and the free atmosphere ( @xmath21 ) simulated by the model ( mj01 and mj01@xmath23 ) plotted against the respective seeing observed by the gs for the sample of 34 nights after calibration .",
    "the boundary layer is defined as the first kilometre above the surface and the free atmosphere from the top of the boundary layer up to 20 km above the surface .",
    "all values of the seeing are calculated opportunely by subtracting in the measurements from the gs the dome seeing contribution and by subtracting in simulations the contribution of first 20 m of the @xmath0-profiles ( the equivalent of the telescope height ) . in figure  [ see_fig ] ( bottom - right of each panel ) is reported the correlation coefficient calculated for the total sample of 41 nights .",
    "table  [ 34_see ] and table  [ err_rel]-left report the values of the average seeing and the relative error for the calibration sample ( 34 nights ) .",
    "table  [ 41_see ] and table  [ err_rel]-right reports the same for the total sample of 41 nights .",
    "the correlation coefficients are indicated for the mj01 and mj01@xmath23 cases in each panel of fig .",
    "[ see_fig ] .",
    "the total seeing and the seeing in the boundary layer show a good correlation ( c.c .",
    "= 0.78 - 0.82 ) with measurements in the calibration sample with no major differences between the mj01 and mj01@xmath23 cases .",
    "it is very encouraging that the turbulence near the ground , that represents most of the turbulence developed in the atmosphere , is well predicted by the model .",
    "the correlation decreases for the seeing in the free atmosphere .",
    "the explanation for such an effect is that , in the free atmosphere , visibly the model inertia is still too high and the parameters predicted by the model varies in a smaller range than what the measurements show as discussed in section [ sec : cn2 ] .",
    "the model has at present some problems in identifying the best ( the minimum observed @xmath21 ) and the worst ( the maximum observed @xmath21 ) conditions in this part of the atmosphere .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ cn2_34 ] it appears clear that the problem concerns the @xmath0 at h @xmath25 10 km .",
    "however , we note that the model ( with both methods , mj01 and mj01@xmath23 ) is able to reconstruct a weaker @xmath21 in summer than in winter as we expect and also as is observed ( table  [ 34_see ] ) . on the sample of calibration no substantial and systematic differences are noted on results obtained with the mj01 and mj01@xmath23 methods .",
    "the very encouraging result is that the relative error for the seeing in all the three regions of the atmosphere ( table [ err_rel]-left ) is very good even in the free atmosphere .",
    "results are equally very good if we look at the individual seasons .",
    "the important conclusion is that the relative error for the seeing on the whole sample is within 9.2% for the best method ( mj01 ) and within 17.6% if we consider also mj01@xmath23 method .",
    "if we consider the two sub - samples ( summer and winter ) the relative error decreases slightly still maintains good performances . in conclusion",
    "we observe relative errors remarkably good in spite of a modest correlation in the free atmosphere .",
    "we also note that the correlation is very good for seeing smaller than 1 arcsec and deviations are more typical when there is strong turbulence . in conclusion",
    "we can say that the method mj01 confirms to be effective and it improves the model reliability reducing some systematic effects .",
    "if we look at the total sample of 41 nights ( table  [ 41_see ] and table  [ err_rel]-right ) , including nights not used for the calibration we observe that the correlation decreases for @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( from 0.82 to 0.61 ) . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the correlation decreases in a less consistent way and the mj01 method seems better than the mj01@xmath23 method in this region .",
    "most of the new nights included in this sample belong to the winter period and the reason for the decrease of the correlation is that the model reconstructs a seeing in the boundary layer that is statistically too strong . in this case , the mj01 method is visibly better than the mj01@xmath23 method in both cases : the total sample and the summer and winter periods .",
    "method mj01 achieves a remarkably good result with a relative error within 9.0% for the total sample and a maximum relative error of 13.9% if we look at the sub - samples ( summer and winter ) .",
    "the mj01 method is also better than mj01@xmath23 method in reconstructing the weakest and the strongest values in the two season in the partial @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "also in this case the model reconstructs a @xmath21 that varies in a smaller range with respect to what observed .",
    "equally to the calibration sample , we can however observe that the model can reconstruct a weaker seeing in summer than in winter as expected .    finally , to study the performance of the model night by night in a compact way",
    ", we have calculated the cumulative distribution of the relative errors with respect to measurements for the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 obtained with the mj01 method and the mj01@xmath23 method ( fig .  [ see_sing ] ) .",
    "we note that the relative error in the three regions of the atmosphere is absolutely remarkably good .",
    "the median values ( 50% of times ) of the relative error is within 26.3% in the three regions of the atmosphere for the mj01 method , which is visibly better than the mj01@xmath23 method in this case .",
    "this means that , even if the correlation for the @xmath21 is not as good as for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the relative error night by night is maintained within 21% .",
    "the biggest relative error is obtained in the boundary layer .",
    "even if this is the region in which the correlation is the best one , the impact of an error of the model can be more important than an error produced in the free atmosphere .",
    "in conclusion we can state that , on the total sample of nights , the mj01 method provides globally better results than the mj01@xmath23 method .",
    "this means that the mj01 method , which is based on a minor number of constraints than the mj01@xmath23 method , has a better performance probably because it is based on more robust physical assumptions",
    ". a larger number of constraints can be effective on the calibration sample but , when an independent sample of nights is taken into account , this theoretical advantage seems to lose its effect .",
    "figure  [ 41_iso ] shows the simulated versus the measured isoplanatic angle @xmath2 for the sample of 41 nights .",
    "@xmath2 depends on the @xmath0 as eq.[theta0 ] in appendix a. the values reconstructed by the model span a much smaller range ( 1.7 - 2.2 ) arcsec than what has been observed ( 0.9 - 5.6 ) arcsec .",
    "the average of the values obtained for all the nights is in good agreement with measurements .",
    "the average of the simulations is equal to 2.06 arcsec for mj01 ( 1.82 arcsec for mj01@xmath23 ) versus 2.65 arcsec measured by the gs .",
    "the difference between simulations and measurements is due to a small off - set in the model calibration .",
    "as we have already discussed in the previous sections , the calibration sample is slightly biased in the high part of the atmosphere by the fact that measurements are not completely homogeneously distributed in the two seasons and in the summer we have many nights with extremely weak turbulence in the high part of the atmosphere .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ cn2_41]-left we can appreciate a generally very good agreement between measurements and simulations but a very weak overestimate by the model is visible in the @xmath0 above 10 km .",
    "@xmath2 is very sensitive even to small variation of the @xmath0 in this region since it scales with @xmath26 .",
    "therefore a very weak difference in the @xmath0 in the high part of the atmosphere can produce sub - arcsecond differences in the isoplanatic angle .",
    "the problem of the small off - set in the average should disappear if one uses for the model calibration a very rich and homogeneous statistical sample of nights ( one year for example ) .",
    "however , the failure of the model in reconstructing the larger variability of @xmath2 quantified by measurements is not due to the calibration but to the fact that , at present , the model shows a larger inertia in the high part of the atmosphere as discussed in section  [ sec : cn2 ] .",

    "in this study we discussed the abilities of the meso - nh model in simulating the optical turbulence above mt graham , site of the large binocular telescope .",
    "simulated @xmath0-profiles are compared to a large statistical sample of measured @xmath0-profiles related to 41 nights obtained with a generalized scidar .",
    "this large sample of measurements allowed us to study the performances of the model calibration in great detail and to investigate the performance of the model in different seasons discussing statistically how well the model reconstruct the @xmath0 , the seeing in different regions of the atmosphere , the isoplanatic angle and the wavefront coherence time .",
    "two different methods of model calibrations have been investigated .",
    "the calibration is done on a sample of 34 nights and the model performances are discussed on the whole sample of 41 nights .",
    "the most important results obtained are:(i ) we have proved that the model calibration definitely improves the model performance .",
    "the morphology of the vertical distribution of the optical turbulence ( average of all @xmath0 of the 34 nights ) matches very well with the corresponding measured @xmath0-profile .",
    "if we look at the model behaviour in different seasons , we show evidence of a model overestimate of @xmath0 in the high part of the atmosphere ( h @xmath25 8 km ) in summer . this bias is highly probable because the sample of the investigated nights is not completely uniformly distributed between summer and winter . with a reasonably richer sample ( of the order of 1 yr ) this small bias can be corrected .",
    "this evidence proves the necessity of a very rich statistical sample to carry out an efficient model calibration .",
    "( ii ) we observed that the model basically always reconstructs the most important features of the shape of the measured @xmath0-profile but it still has some difficulties in reconstructing the very extreme values ( very good and very bad turbulence conditions ) in the free atmosphere .",
    "we are working at present on improving these model performances .",
    "( iii ) for the model calibration , the total and boundary layer seeing reconstructed by the meso - nh model are well correlated with measured values with a correlation coefficient ( c.c . ) of the order of 0.78 - 0.82 .",
    "the seeing in the free atmosphere is more weakly correlated to measurements ( c.c .",
    "@xmath180.58 ) . the relative errors are however extremely good in all the three regions ( total seeing , in the boundary layer and free atmosphere ) .",
    "the best method mj01 provide a relative error within 9.2@xmath17 on the total sample and within 14.9% if we consider the two seasons .",
    "these percentages remain basically the same if we consider the whole sample of 41 nights .",
    "( iv ) when we consider the total sample of 41 nights the correlation between simulations and measurements decreases slightly for @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( c.c .",
    "@xmath180.60 ) , much less for @xmath21 ( c.c .",
    "@xmath180.47).(v ) if we consider the cumulative distribution of the relative errors night by night ( i.e. the typical conditions of the operational mode ) we find extremely encouraging results .",
    "the median value of the relative errors is indeed extremely small with some small variations for the seeing in the three regions of the atmosphere but typical of the order of 20@xmath17 .",
    "therefore even if we look at the most difficult conditions typical of the operational mode , the model maintains a reasonable good result .",
    "( vi ) for the isoplanatic angle the relative error of the average is still very good ( @xmath18 18% ) but the median of the relative errors calculated night by night is 35.1% .",
    "it is the parameter with the poorest performances between @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is not surprising because it is the parameter that , more than others , is very sensitive to the turbulence in the high part of the atmosphere .",
    "( vii ) the wavefront coherence time reconstructed by the model shows a very good correlation with measurements ( c.c .",
    "@xmath18 0.95 ) .",
    "we proved that the small bias in the high atmosphere on the @xmath0 produces a negligible effect on @xmath3 .",
    "the first 0 - 10 km represent the most important contributions to the final @xmath3 value .",
    "the cumulative distribution of the relative error calculated night by night is still very good with a median value equal to 22.5% .",
    "( viii ) the mj01 method to calibrate the model confirms to be a solid method and it shows a general better performance of the model than the variant mj01@xmath23 , which consists in fitting measurements and simulations on each model level instead of vertical slabs of a few kilometers .",
    "it is worth to note that the calibration of the high atmosphere is more delicate because a small discrepancy from the measured @xmath0-profile can produce a large discrepancy on some astroclimatic parameters ( such as @xmath2).the general conclusions are that the meso - nh model is able to describe the optical turbulence distribution above mt graham showing very good performances with small relative errors with respect to measurements for most of the astroclimatic parameters .",
    "the most urgent problem to be solved is the improvement of the model ability in reconstructing the very weak and very strong turbulent conditions in the high atmosphere , i.e.  the ability in reconstructing isoplanatic angles in better agreement with measurements .",
    "finally we have put in evidence the importance to have a very rich statistical sample of @xmath0-profiles to efficiently calibrate the model . in the future we would like to access an even much richer samples of measurements done preferably with a gs in order to be able to consider a completely independent sample for the model validation . in the future",
    "it would also be interesting to test the model performance when it is initialized with forecasts from the ecmwf instead of the operational analyses in order to use the meso - nh model as a part of a system to forecast the optical turbulence at mt graham allowing the implementation of a flexible - scheduling management of the lbt .",
