    "for a particular class of interaction unitaries , the authors of  @xcite have shown that the collision model leads to a dynamics which can be described by a lindblad super - operator via direct integration of the equation of motion . here",

    "the two scenarios are however different . in the standard case",
    "the reason for which the environment state is unchanged is because it is big . in our scenario , consistently with the collision model , the environment state is constant because , as we said , each subsystem collides briefly with a sequence of sub - environments all initially in the same state .",

    "when this happens also the partial trace over @xmath7 of @xmath98 nullifies , i.e. @xmath111 . accordingly the evolution of _ any _ subset of @xmath0 is independent from the evolution of the remaining carriers . in this case",
    "hence our model becomes non - anticipatory with respect to all possible ordering of the carriers , describing hence a _ non - signaling _ evolution  @xcite in which the reduced density matrix of each carrier evolves independently from the others .",

    "this assumption was specifically introduced to account for the causal correlations that are present in many memory quantum channel models  @xcite .",
    "the collisional model however can be generalized to include more general correlations .",

    "to do so it is sufficient to add an independent set @xmath127 of sub - environments @xmath128 which couple with @xmath0 following a new ordering in which ( say ) all the carriers are shifted by one position ( i.e. the element of @xmath127 first interact with @xmath103 , then with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and finally with @xmath102 ) .",
    "a part from the new ordering the new couplings are assumed to share the same properties of those that apply to @xmath6 ( in particular we require that identities analogous to those in eqs .
