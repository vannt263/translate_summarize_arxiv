    "it has been found that the external electric and microwave fields on optical lattices can control quantum many body interactions parameters of dipolar systems and polar molecules @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the long range and anisotropic characters of the dipolar interactions , in fact , can provide various types of exotic phases like , charge - density wave ( cdw ; even though the density modulation is produced by charge neutral atoms or molecules , it is called cdw in the literature)@xcite , spin density wave ( sdw ; spin order for pseudo - spin-1/2 of dipolar fermions , shown in schematic of fig.2(a ) ) @xcite , liquid - crystal@xcite , conventional and unconventional fermionic superfluids @xcite , to name a few .",

    "a dominant @xmath5-wave superfluidity has been proposed@xcite . for two components fermions",
    ", it has been shown that there is possibility of formation of both singlet and triplet superfluidity@xcite , as both singlet and triplet pairing are allowed in such systems . in two - dimensional dipolar fermionic system , where dipoles are aligned with external electric field , it has been shown that p - wave superfluidity can be realized by varying anisotropy and geometry of the system@xcite .",
    "unconventional spin - density waves@xcite and bond - order solids@xcite have also been shown for the two - dimensional dipolar systems .",

    "bilayer system has been proposed , where dipoles are aligned perpendicular to the layers , giving more stable paired phases@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider dipolar fermions in a triangular ladder system at half - filling .",

    "the dipolar fermions are considered to be polarized along the rungs of the triangles ( as shown in schematic of fig.1 ) .",
    "the strength and direction of polarization can be controlled by external electric field or by varying distance between lattice sites . due to alignment of dipolar fermions along the rungs ,",
    "attractive interaction is generated on alternative rungs ( odd rungs ) .",

    "interestingly , due to triangular geometry , three - body interactions can also play important role in identifying new quantum phase , like , fermionic super - solid phase of dipolar fermions@xcite .    the remaining part of the article is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we have discussed the model hamiltonian and the method used to solve it .",
    "subsequently , we have discussed the results obtained from dmrg calculations .",
    "this is divided into four subsections , where in each subsection the details of phase and phase transition is discussed . in last section",
    ", we have summarized all our results .",
    "we consider two - component ( pseudo - spin-1/2 ) dipolar fermions on a two - leg triangular ladder at half - filling .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the system can be written as , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is annihilation operator with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 states refer to two hyperfine states of diploar atoms or molecules .",
    "@xmath13 where n is the number operator and @xmath14 . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the hopping terms and @xmath17 is the onsite interaction term between the fermion with opposite spins ; @xmath18 is the two - body nearest - neighbour intersite interaction term .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian , @xmath19 , represents attractive three body interactions between the fermions , which act on the fermions belonging to the same triangle ( as shown in the fig.1 ) .",
    "the two - body interaction term depend on direction and distance between the dipoles .",
    "when the two dipoles are parallel to each other , the interaction becomes repulsive , while when they align to each other along the rungs , interaction become attractive .",
    "the most dominating interactions arise from the nearest - neighbour terms@xcite , and also in optical lattice by adjusting the distance between sites , one can make other subdominating interactions quite smaller@xcite .",
    "thus , we restrict ourself to only nearest - neighbour terms of @xmath18 in the hamiltonian@xcite . the two body nearest - neighbour term , @xmath18 , can be described as @xmath20 since the dipolar interaction depends on angle and distance between the dipoles , it allows tuning of magnitude and sign of these interaction parameters to a wide range to explore rich quantum many - body phases .",
    "the dipolar interactions can be tuned by external electric field or changing the distance between sites .",
    "the above hamiltonian preserves @xmath21 and @xmath22 symmetry , which is related to conservation of total charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "note that , for nonzero next nearest neighbor terms , @xmath15 and @xmath19 , the hamiltonian does not have particle - hole symmetry .    to solve the above hamiltonian and to find quantum phases in the parameter space ,",
    "we have used density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite method .",
    "we have used open boundary conditions and vary the dmrg cut - off ( max = m ) from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , for consistency in results . most of the results presented in the article are obtained using max=@xmath25 , unless otherwise stated . to calculate the error , we have checked the truncation error , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the eigenvalues corresponding to the reduced density matrix . we found that depending upon the interaction parameters and system size , truncation error @xmath28 varies from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "we have verified energy and excitations for some parameters with those from exact diagonalization for smaller system sizes . to characterize different phases , namely @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 phases , we have calculated corresponding correlation functions and also spin and charge density profiles . for showing plots of correlation functions , unless stated explicitly , we have considered system size @xmath34 . to determine phase boundary between different phases and to minimize the finite size effect",
    ", we have done finite - size scaling of order - parameters , of the system with size ( l ) up to @xmath35 .",
    "we first consider a simple case , where @xmath36 , the intersite repulsive dipolar term , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and three body term , @xmath39 . due to long range of dipolar interactions , two chains of traingular ladder",
    "can couple through attractive dipolar interaction , @xmath40 , even though the tunneling between the chains remain zero@xcite . for finding tsf phase ,",
    "we take onsite hubbard interaction @xmath41 , and vary the attractive interaction , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 to @xmath44 ) , along the rungs ( odd rungs ) . for @xmath41 and lower vales of @xmath40",
    ", we find that to minimize repulsive onsite interaction , fermions stay put in each site and form spin density wave , @xmath45 ( as shown in schematic of fig.2(a ) ) . in order to show spin density profile of the system , in fig.2(b ) , we have plotted spin - density @xmath46 of system , with site index , @xmath10 . with increase in attractive interaction , @xmath40 , the fermions form intersite pairs along the rungs of the ladder , where the electronic spins form triplet symmetry ( latexmath:[$|s^z=0\\rangle=     this phase remains so for moderate values of @xmath42 . for large value of attractive interaction , fermions with up and down spin prefer to sit together and form cdw - phase , where the state appears like , @xmath48 ( as shown in schematic of fig2(a ) ) . to show this , in fig.2(c )",
    ", we have plotted charge density profile of fermions , @xmath49 , with site index @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , this cdw - phase appears even without any intersite - repulsive terms . thus is precisely due to the triangular geometry and the attractive interaction along leg - direction@xcite .",
    "however , in strictly one dimensional case , for large values of attractive interaction , the system goes to either phase - separated phase or it collapses@xcite .    in order to characterize sdw , tsf and cdw phases and their boundaries , we vary @xmath42 with fixed value of @xmath50 , and we look into the behavior of corresponding correlation functions . for sdw phase , we have calculated correlation function , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 ( even distances ) is the distance from the middle site of the ladder to the one end of the ladder . we found that with increase in @xmath52 , fluctuations appears in the correlation function ( appendix fig.15 ) . to reduce these fluctuations ,",

    ", the tsf phase can be characterized by pair correlation function@xcite @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , creates a fermionic pair in spin triplet state on a rung ( labeled @xmath59 ) and @xmath52 ( even distance ) is the distance from the rung @xmath59 ( near to the center of the triangular ladder ) .",
    "this correlation function @xmath60 , is also called @xmath5 wave like superfluid correlation function , because of spin triplet pairing along z direction . for @xmath60 also , fluctuations appear with increase in @xmath52 . to smooth out these fluctuations ,",

    "accurately between @xmath31 and @xmath32 phases , we have calculated the exponent of the correlation function , @xmath55 .",
    "the exponent , @xmath62 , can be obtained by fitting the correlation function with algebraic decay function of the form , @xmath63 ( as shown in fig .",
    "to get rid of short range correlation functions and the finite size effects , we have fitted the correlation function , @xmath55 , from distance r = 10 to 70 , for system size length l=160 .",

    "interestingly , for large values of attractive interaction , @xmath42 , when the system is in the cdw - phase , it gets hardly affected by inter chain hopping term , as the charge ordered state arrests the effective hopping between the chains . however , close to the phase boundary between tsf and cdw phases , when the system is near the cdw phase boundary , for finite values of @xmath16 , system can again make transition to the tsf phase .",

    "we have demonstrated the stability of spin triplet phase , by introducing inter leg hopping , which effectively enhances the spin triplet superfluid phase region by replacing the spin density wave phase . in presence of repulsive interactions , we show transition between tsf phase and a cdw phase",
    ". we also have looked at the effect of three body interactions on the tsf and cdw phases .",
    "we find that the three body term can introduce a fermionic supersolid phase , where both tsf and cdw coexist .",
    "we strongly believe that our study , which unravel the rich physics of exotic phases of dipolar - fermionic systems in ultra - cold systems would show inroads for further experiments .",

    "to check the accuracy of our dmrg calculations , we have calculated truncation error of the system . in dmrg",
    ", the effective basis is truncated by keeping the @xmath149 largest eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix corresponding to the @xmath149 largest eigenvalues . the error caused by the truncation",
    "can be measured by calculating @xmath150 , where @xmath27 is the eigenvalues corresponding to the reduced density matrix .",
    "fig.14 shows plot of truncation error with max values @xmath149 , for system size @xmath34 and * for interaction parameters values @xmath41 , @xmath83 , keeping all the other parameters , @xmath16 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath19 , as zero*. with increase in max value @xmath151 , truncation error changes very slowly .    to check the behaviour of correlation function , @xmath60 , with max values , we have calculated the correlation function with different max values ( fig.15 ) . as shown in inset of fig.15",
    ", @xmath60 almost overlaps for @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "this proves that @xmath149 value of @xmath135 , is large enough to obtain accurate correlation function , @xmath60 .",
    "we have used open boundary condition for our calculations in @xmath154 . to remove the edge effects ,",
    "we have computed correlation functions from central site to one side of the triangular ladder . in case of correlation functions @xmath55 and @xmath60 , we found that with increase in distance @xmath52 , rapid fluctuations appeared in correlation functions .",
    "as shown in fig.16 , to smoothen these fluctuations , we have calculated average correlation function , @xmath53 , where we took the sum over the correlations , which are separated by the same distance @xmath52 from the sites @xmath10 from the other side of the ladder .",
    "this is then divided by the number , @xmath54 , of such same distance correlations . while averaging , * we excluded lattice sites within distance @xmath155 from both the end of the ladder ( of system size , @xmath75)*. we have calculated the average correlation function , @xmath156 , by summing over the correlations , which are separated by same distance @xmath52 and divide the sum by @xmath54 .",
    "as discused in section iii.e , for large values of @xmath157 , the system enters into a phase separated state . in fig.17 ,",
    "the plot of charge density profile @xmath126 has been shown , for interaction parameters , @xmath158 , @xmath83 , @xmath120 , @xmath119 , @xmath110 and three diffrent values of @xmath19 . for @xmath159 ,",
    "the system shows a periodic density modulation , while for @xmath127 , inhomogenious feature appears in the density profile .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath127 , the @xmath126 takes the maximum possible values ( @xmath160 ) near the center of the ladder , and for @xmath161 , it shifts to one side of the ladder . for @xmath162",
