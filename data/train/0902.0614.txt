    "[ intro ] understanding the gauge theory on a stack of d - branes probing a calabi  yau singularity is an important problem with many applications . while the case of a general calabi ",
    "yau manifold remains poorly understood , in the past few years considerable progress has been made in the case of toric calabi  yaus . for these , the low energy field theory on the d - branes is given by a quiver gauge theory , and can be analyzed using powerful brane tiling techniques initiated and developed in @xcite .",
    "a different way of understanding such configurations of d - branes is through the derived category approach proposed in @xcite ; see @xcite for an excellent review . while working with the derived category of coherent sheaves , @xmath0 ,",
    "is again difficult for a general calabi ",
    "yau @xmath1 , the situation again simplifies when @xmath1 is toric and tools like exceptional collections can be used to analyze the system @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "based on the mathematical work of mozgovoy and reineke @xcite , ooguri and yamazaki proposed a statistical model of crystal melting that counts bound states of d0 and d2 branes in the background of a single d6 brane wrapping the whole toric calabi  yau .",
    "this model utilizes both approaches mentioned above , and can be used for instance to compute donaldson ",
    "thomas invariants for an arbitrary toric calabi  yau . this crystal is built upon the planar quiver describing the theory , and the construction relies on a set of consistency conditions on the corresponding brane tiling . in this note i show that these consistency conditions are indeed satisfied for any quiver theory arising from a configuration of d - branes ; they are shown to follow from the conformality of the low energy field theory .",
    "[ review ] in this section i briefly review quiver gauge theories arising as low energy field theories on the world volume of a stack of d - branes probing the conical singularity of a toric calabi  yau ; for excellent extended reviews on this topic the reader is referred to @xcite .    [ [ quivers ] ] quivers : + + + + + + + +    quiver gauge theories are specified by a set @xmath2 of gauge groups su(@xmath3 ) , and a set @xmath4 of matter fields transforming in the bifundamental representation @xmath5 under two of the gauge groups . in addition there is a superpotential , which for a toric calabi ",
    "yau is always a sum of monomials , such that each matter field appears in exactly two terms with opposite signs .",
    "figure [ fig - quiver ] shows the quiver and the superpotential corresponding to @xmath6 , where @xmath6 denotes the toric calabi ",
    "yau that is given by a complex cone over the first del pezzo surface .",
    "it is well known that any such quiver can be ` opened up ' and placed on a torus in such a way that the faces of the new graph correspond to the superpotential terms ; a clockwise orientation of a face corresponds to a negative term and vice versa @xcite .",
    "this is known as the planar ( or periodic ) quiver , and is also pictured in figure [ fig - quiver ] .",
    "we will mostly work with the universal covering of the planar quiver , which is an infinite , periodic graph on @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the quiver by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 contains the faces , i.e. superpotential terms .",
    "[ [ the - brane - tiling - and - perfect - matchings ] ] the brane tiling and perfect matchings : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the dual graph of the planar quiver is particularly useful .",
    "it is generated by replacing the faces of the planar quiver by vertices , replacing vertices by faces , and replacing the arrows with perpendicular edges .",
    "see figure [ fig - tiling ] for an illustration for the case of @xmath6 .",
    "since the faces of the planar quiver correspond to either positive or negative superpotential terms , we can color the vertices of the brane tiling to reflect this sign ; we choose black vertices for negative terms and white for positive ones .",
    "thus we see that the brane tiling is a bipartite graph ; white vertices are only connected to black vertices and vice versa .",
    "therefore , a brane tiling @xmath10 consists of two sets of vertices , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , corresponding to positive and negative superpotential terms , a set of edges @xmath13 corresponding to the bifundamental matter fields , and a set of faces corresponding to the gauge groups .        a perfect matching of a tiling @xmath14 is a subset of the edges such that each vertex in @xmath15 is touched by exactly one edge in the perfect matching .",
    "figure [ fig - tiling ] shows one of the perfect matchings of @xmath6 .",
    "a given bipartite graph need not have a perfect matching ; however , i will show in section 3 that for a physical brane tiling , that is a bipartite graph arising from a configuration of d - branes , a perfect matching always exists .",
    "[ [ the - isoradial - embedding - and - rhombus - lattice ] ] the isoradial embedding and rhombus lattice : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to prove the consistency conditions of the crystal model @xcite we need to take into account the fact that the low energy field theory on the world - volume of the branes is conformal .",
    "this means that the nsvz beta functions for all gauge groups must vanish , which implies ( see @xcite ) @xmath16        where the sum is over all the matter fields transforming under that gauge group @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denotes the r - charge of the corresponding field .",
    "further , the superpotential has to be marginal , so each term in the superpotential must have r - charge 2 .",
    "recalling that in the planar quiver the superpotential terms correspond to faces , this implies @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a face in the planar quiver , and the sum is over all the edges surrounding that face .",
    "the relations ( [ beta ] ) and ( [ w ] ) can be written in terms of the brane tiling as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is any vertex on the brane tiling and the first sum is over all edges connected to that vertex , and @xmath20 is a face on the tiling and the second sum is over all the edges surrounding that face .",
    "these relations have a very nice geometric interpretation .",
    "consider an embedding of the brane tiling where one draws a unit circle for each of the faces of the tiling , and places the vertices on the circumference of the circle .",
    "this is known as the isoradial embedding , and is shown in figure [ fig - isorad ] for @xmath6 .",
    "next draw lines from the centers of the circles to the vertices on the circumference ; this yields a lattice consisting of rhombi and is shown in figures [ fig - isorad ] and [ fig - isorad2 ] .",
    "half of the vertices of the rhombi are on the vertices of the brane tiling , i.e. the superpotential terms , while the other half of the vertices are on the faces of the tiling , i.e. the gauge groups .",
    "thus , depending on which diagonals we focus on we get the brane tiling or the planar quiver ; the rhombus lattice contains the data of both graphs .",
    "each rhombus is characterized by an angle @xmath23 , which we choose to be opposite the diagonal corresponding to an arrow in the quiver , and we associate the angle @xmath23 to the r - charge @xmath24 of the corresponding field by @xmath25 we see that ( [ w-2 ] ) and ( [ beta-2 ] ) are automatically satisfied ; the first equation translates to the angles summing to @xmath26 around a superpotential vertex , while the second translates to the sum of internal angles in a polygon being ( # edges -2)@xmath27 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig - isorad3 ] .",
    "note that for the rhombus lattice to be non - degenerate we need all r - charges to lie in the interval @xmath28 ; this holds for any physical tiling @xcite .",
    "[ [ train - tracks - and - zig - zag - paths ] ] train tracks and zig - zag paths : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the rhombus lattice has a set of special paths , known as rhombus paths or train tracks . these are constructed by joining together rhombi sharing parallel edges , as in figure [ fig - zigzag ] .",
    "each such path defines a path in the planar quiver that turns alternately maximally left and right , known as a zig - zag path .",
    "it is known that for a tiling arising from a system of branes , i.e. one having an isoradial embedding , a zig - zag path never intersects itself , and two zig - zag paths intersect at most at one edge @xcite .",
    "[ [ the - path - algebra ] ] the path algebra : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    consider the algebra @xmath29 , which consists of all paths in the quiver .",
    "the multiplication in @xmath29 is defined by joining two paths when the first ends where the second begins , otherwise the product is zero .",
    "since the arrows on the quiver correspond to bifundamental fields , the f - term relations give relations in the path algebra .",
    "figure [ fig - paths ] shows three paths in the path algebra of @xmath6 which are seen to be identical by using the f - terms relations . if we denote the ideal generated by the f - term conditions by @xmath30 , the independent paths are given by the factor algebra @xmath31 .",
    "let us denote the shortest path between vertices @xmath32 and @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "also , denote the loop around a face in the quiver by @xmath35 ; all such loops are equivalent by the f - term relations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the elements in the factor algebra @xmath36 can be written in the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a natural number .",
    "the crystal model @xcite is built on the mathematical work @xcite , who place three consistency conditions for the brane tiling : ( 3.5 ) , ( 4.12 ) and ( 5.3 ) in @xcite .",
    "the first two of these are fairly trivial , though we prove ( 3.5 ) in detail since as a consequence we can also prove that any physical brane tiling has a perfect matching . although perfect matchings are widely used in the physics literature , to my best knowledge this is the first direct proof , are central to the dimer literature , and perfect matchings appear in the coefficients @xmath39 . if there were no perfect matchings the coefficients would vanish . in @xcite",
    "it was argued via mirror symmetry that these coefficients are generally nonzero ; the proof given here verifies this result directly without requiring mirror symmetry . ]",
    "that they exist for any physical tiling .",
    "most of this section is devoted proving condition ( 5.3 ) of @xcite .",
    "[ [ condition-3.5 ] ] condition 3.5 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the first consistency condition of @xcite is that the tiling should be non - degenerate , meaning that every edge in the brane tiling belongs to some perfect matching .",
    "we will proceed to show that this holds for physical tilings using the following lemma :        any physical brane tiling @xmath10 has a perfect matching .    for any subset @xmath40 of white vertices",
    ", we define the set of neighbors @xmath41 to consist of all the black vertices that are connected to vertices in @xmath36 by an edge in @xmath42 .",

    "this follows from marginality of the superpotential ; since each superpotential term has r - charge 2 , the edges connected to the vertices in @xmath36 have total r - charge @xmath46 .",
    "since each of the edges is connected to a vertex in @xmath47 , this charge is divided among the neighboring vertices @xmath47 . since each vertex can have only two units of r - charge , the pigeonhole principle states that @xmath45 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig - bad ] .",
    "this proves that @xmath14 has a perfect matching .",
    "we can go a bit further and show that @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "first assume @xmath50 .",
    "then by the previous argument each vertex in @xmath51 must already have r - charge 2 , and therefore ca nt be connected to any new vertices , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "but this implies that either @xmath53 , @xmath54 , or the tiling consists of two or more disconnected pieces , which is impossible . thus either @xmath54 or @xmath53 .",
    "physical brane tilings are non - degenerate , i.e. each edge belongs to a perfect matching .",
    "pick an edge @xmath55 .",
    "let us construct a new bipartite graph @xmath56 by removing from @xmath14 the two vertices that are connected by @xmath57 , and all the edges that are connected to either of those vertices .",
    "note that if @xmath14 only had two vertices , each edge is already a perfect matching ; we can thus assume @xmath58 .",
    "pick any subset of white vertices @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath56 has a perfect matching iff @xmath60 . denotes the neighbors in the tiling @xmath56 , and @xmath47 denotes the neighbors in the tiling @xmath14 . ]",
    "this follows since @xmath56 is a subtiling of @xmath14 : @xmath36 is also a subset of white vertices in @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath61 we have @xmath48 , where the neighbors are taken in @xmath14 . restricting to @xmath56 we see that @xmath62 or @xmath63 , depending on whether the removed vertex was a neighbor to @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath64 .",
    "this proves the theorem , since we can define @xmath65 , which is a perfect matching of the tiling @xmath14 , and contains the edge @xmath57 .",
    "[ [ condition-5.3 ] ] condition 5.3 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    having proved condition 3.5 , we turn our attention to the second consistency condition :    for any two vertices @xmath66 in the planar quiver , there exists an arrow @xmath67 such that @xmath68 .",
    "[ thm - main ]    to prove this , we will need a few useful lemmas :    if two vertices @xmath32 and @xmath33 are along the same zig - zag path , the zig - zag path provides @xmath34 , the shortest path between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "[ lem - zigminimum ]        consider the path from @xmath32 to @xmath33 and back again to @xmath32 portrayed in figure [ fig - zig - min ] .",
    "this path is equivalent to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the number of faces circled by the path . due to the structure of the rhombus lattice ,",
    "@xmath70 is the minimal number of faces that will be circled by any path @xmath71 , and thus the path is equivalent to @xmath72 , the path of minimal length from @xmath32 to @xmath32 passing through @xmath33 . but",
    "clearly @xmath73 , which proves that the zig - zag path is equivalent to @xmath34 .",
    "for any two vertices @xmath32 and @xmath33 , if there is a zig - zag path @xmath74 passing through @xmath33 such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , then @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath17,@xmath78 and @xmath79 are the next three arrows in the zig - zag path starting from @xmath33 , and @xmath80,@xmath81 and @xmath82 are the end points of @xmath17,@xmath78 and @xmath79 ; see figure [ fig - main ] .",
    "[ lem - tough ]        each arrow in the quiver belongs to exactly two zig - zag paths .",
    "thus , there are unique zig - zag paths different from @xmath74 that pass through @xmath78 and @xmath79 , let us denote these by @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "these are also shown in figure [ fig - main ] ; however the reader should note that one should nt rely too much on the figure : the way the figure has been drawn it appears that @xmath83 and @xmath84 intersect in the rhombus whose diagonal arrow is denoted @xmath85 .",
    "this need not be the case ; @xmath85 is meant to represent the path that completes the face on which the vertices @xmath86 lie ; if the face is a triangle as drawn then @xmath83 and @xmath84 intersect there as shown in the figure , if the face is a polygon with more than three edges , then @xmath85 is not an edge but rather a path of edges completing the face , in which case @xmath83 and @xmath84 do not intersect in that rhombus .",
    "the reader can verify that the proof presented here does not rely on such aspects of the graph .",
    "the three zig - zag paths divide the plane into regions denoted i , ii and iii in the figure .",
    "i have drawn vertex @xmath32 to reside in region i ; the reader can verify that if @xmath32 was in region ii the conditions of the lemma would not be satisfied , and if it resided in region iii an argument similar to the one given below will show the lemma to be true .",
    "now let us assume the lemma is not true : @xmath87 , i.e. there exists a path @xmath88 that is shorter than @xmath89 .",
    "this path is shown in figure [ fig - main ] as a red path .",
    "denote by @xmath90 the vertex where @xmath91 hits the zig - zag path @xmath84 . to cross @xmath84 ;",
    "if this is not the case , i.e. the path @xmath91 is directed towards left in the figure , then it must cross the original zig - zag path @xmath74 and a similar argument applies .",
    "thus we can assume @xmath91 crosses @xmath84 .",
    "] now , we can take the path @xmath92 to be given by travelling first along @xmath91 from @xmath32 to @xmath82 , and then around the face given by @xmath93 .",
    "need not be a single arrow , it represents the rest of the arrows around this face .",
    "] then we have @xmath94 , and we can cancel @xmath95 to yield @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 is the shortest path @xmath98 . now consider path @xmath22 , which is defined by travelling on @xmath91 until @xmath90 , and then taking the magenta path @xmath57 to @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath57 is a neighboring path to @xmath84 in the sense of the proof of lemma [ lem - zigminimum ] ; it need not be a single arrow as drawn in the figure .",
    "it was shown in the proof of lemma [ lem - zigminimum ] that such a neighboring path is the shortest path between its endpoints .",
    "it is also easily shown that the red path @xmath99 is longer than the path @xmath57 ; thus we have constructed a path @xmath100 that is shorter than @xmath97 .",
    "this is a contradiction since our assumption that the lemma is false yielded @xmath101 ; thus our assumption must be wrong and the lemma holds .",
    "the readers can easily convince themselves that if @xmath32 was located in region @xmath102 or if the path @xmath91 crossed @xmath74 instead of @xmath84 similar arguments can be used to prove the lemma .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be two vertices , and @xmath34 the shortest path between them .",
    "we need to show that there exists an arrow @xmath67 such that @xmath103 .",
    "consider the last arrow on path @xmath34 , which we denote by @xmath78 .",
    "it belongs to exactly two zig - zag paths ; one turning maximally right and one turning maximally left at @xmath33 ; let us denote the next arrows on these paths by @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively ; see figure [ fig - main2 ] .",
    "we claim that either @xmath105 or @xmath104 can be identified with @xmath17 so that the theorem holds .",
    "we prove this by assuming that one of them does not have the property of @xmath17 , and then showing that the other one must have it .",
    "assume @xmath105 does not have the property , i.e. @xmath106",
    ". we can take @xmath107 to be first @xmath108 , and then a loop around the face indicated in figure [ fig - main ] , which is surrounded by @xmath105 , @xmath78 , and the magenta path @xmath82 .",
    "denote by @xmath90 the last vertex before the magenta path hits @xmath78 ; if the face is a triangle then @xmath109 .",
    "since this path shares the same last arrow with @xmath110 , we can cancel @xmath105 to yield @xmath111 .",
    "thus the path constructed is also the shortest path @xmath112 , and trivially also the shortest path to any vertex it passes . following this path to @xmath90 then gives the shortest path @xmath113 . but now note that the indicated path from @xmath90 to @xmath114 is a zig - zag path : one first follows the last arrow of the magenta path , turns maximally left , follows @xmath78 and then turns maximally right .",
    "but we also know that this constructed path is the shortest path @xmath112 , so the conditions of lemma [ lem - tough ] are satisfied , and if we take another step on the zig - zag path , by lemma [ lem - tough ] we again have a shortest path , and thus @xmath115 , and the theorem is proved .",
