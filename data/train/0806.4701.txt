    "interference phenomena of material particles ( matter waves ) as electrons , neutrons , atoms , etc provide the most striking evidence for the need to elaborate a new mechanics which goes beyond and encompasses classical mechanics .    at the same time , phenomena like photoelectric and compton effects show a `` corpuscular '' behavior of radiation requiring , therefore , the need for a revision of the classical description of radiation .",
    "the associated quantitative results suggest that wave - like and corpuscular - like attributes satisfy the following einstein- de broglie relation @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the coordinates of the phase space and @xmath2 stands for the time .",
    "this relation between the poincar one form on the phase - space over the space - time and the optical phase - space establishes a relation between momentum ( @xmath3 ) and energy ( @xmath4 ) of the corpuscular behavior and the wave - number ( @xmath5 ) and frequency ( @xmath6 ) of the wave behavior .",
    "the dimensional proportionality coefficient is the planck constant .",
    "we may use this relation to predict under which experimental conditions light will behave like a `` corpuscule '' and an electron will behave like a `` wave '' .    by means of this relation it is possible to conceive of interference experiments like the one of the double slit . when carried on with electrons , we find some peculiar results for which we do not have a simple interpretation in the classical framework .",
    "the actual experiment has been performed in such a way that at each time only one electron is present between the source and the screen .",
    "it is found that the electron impinges on the screen at `` given points '' and leave a spot .",
    "all the spots are alike , there are no `` half - spots '' . after a few hundred electrons have passed we find a picture of spots erratically distributed on the screen , as we can see in the following picture        however , with several thousands electrons , we get a very clear interference pattern",
    ".        experiments of this kind have been performed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the same findings occur if we experiment with photons ( light quanta ) , again with an experimental arrangement that makes sure that only one photon is present between source and screen at each time .",
    "these interference aspects call for a theory with a wave - like description , having a statistical - probabilistic character , along with an intrinsically discrete aspect ( i.e no half - spots should be possible )",
    ".    we could try now to perform an experiment to watch which path the electrons follow on its way from the source to the screen .",
    "an experimental setup uses a conducting plate and the mirror image of the charge to find out which region will be `` heated '' by the passage of the electron ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the setup is as follows :        we find that for @xmath7 the interference pattern disappears :             we may try to summarize the main findings of our experiments :    * electrons arrive at the screen in identical lumps * there is a wave associated with the electrons to describe the interference pattern * there is a probability for the electron to impinge on the screen within a preassigned region * under some appropriate experimental conditions we recover a classical - like behavior of the electrons , i.e. the interference pattern disappears .",
    "more specifically , the more visible the interference pattern is , the less distinguishable the paths are .",
    "what we have described is quite counter - intuitive for particles , but it is even more startling for light .",
    "we have to accept that it is not so simple to elaborate a model capable of accounting for these results within the classical framework .",
    "indeed light provides the most relevant example of the dual nature of quantum objects : its oscillatory properties were suitable to verify the electromagnetic theory of maxwell , while its lumpiness ( the photons ) signalled the birth of modern quantum theory .",
    "the dualism between the two pictures may appear to be in contradiction , however it constitutes the first example of what is known as complementarity in quantum theory , i.e. the possibility to display both wave and corpuscular properties .    from the historical point of view",
    ", things went differently because inconsistencies arose already in the derivation of the spectral distribution of energy density of a black body radiation .",
    "max planck proposed his well known ad - hoc modification of the standard phenomenological approach .",
    "his result , however , did not explain the physics behind the successful result .",
    "another deficiency of the classical theory arose at the level of the models available for atoms and molecules , where it was not possible to account for the stability of atoms and molecules while explaining the detected atomic spectra .",
    "an account of the experimental background material can be found in most textbooks of quantum mechanics , for instance in ( @xcite ) .",
    "various efforts of the youngest theoretical physicists of that period gave rise to two alternative , but equivalent , formulations of quantum mechanics , usually associated to the names of schrdinger and heisenberg . as it is usually the case , though , the final theory grew out of the efforts of a reasonable large community of theoretical physicists during the first half of the xxth century .",
    "this paper is an expanded version of some lectures delivered by one of us ( g. m. ) at the `` advanced winter school on the mathematical foundation of quantum control and quantum information '' which took place at castro urdiales ( spain ) , february 11 - 15 , 2008 .",
    "the audience was composed of phd students in mathematics and in physics , and this explains the pedagogical nature of this paper .",
    "the content of the lectures has been revised and expanded in a substantial way by both of us .",
    "of course , if there are waves to describe the wave - like behavior , there ought to be a wave equation to describe the evolution of the system in time .",
    "this equation is called the schrdinger equation and has the following structure : @xmath8 the solutions , as functions of time , describe the time evolution of the initial conditions of the system .",
    "the complex valued function @xmath9 is called * the wave function * and is defined on the configuration space of the system we are considering . from a physical point of view it is interpreted as a probability amplitude , but this interpretation requires , for consistency , that @xmath10 i.e. the probabilistic interpretation requires @xmath11 to be a probability density and @xmath9 to be square integrable on the domain @xmath12 where our physical system is defined .",
    "we conclude thus that wave functions representing physical systems must be elements of the hilbert space of square integrable functions defined on the configuration space @xmath12 .",
    "we shall denote this space as @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath14 is usually called the * hamiltonian * operator and it acts on wave functions as a linear differential operator . the spectrum will be real , if @xmath14 is self - adjoint . if it is unbounded and if its domain of definition does not coincide with @xmath15 we say that we have to `` face domain problems '' .",
    "the requirement of linearity arises from the superposition rule usually associated with the description of interference phenomena .    to avoid dealing with unbounded operators , often one starts from the `` exponentiated version '' of our evolution equation , i.e. a formal solution of the equation [ eq : schrodinger ] , which we write as @xmath16 if @xmath14 does not depend on time the expression of the evolution operator @xmath17 may be written as : @xmath18    in this form the evolution operator is bounded and always reversible .",
    "it defines a one - parameter group of unitary transformations on the hilbert space defined by the wave functions .",
    "unitarity of the evolution means that such evolution is compatible with the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "starting with the evolution expressed as a one - parameter group of unitary transformations , the operator @xmath14 , which defines the schrdinger equation , emerges as the infinitesimal generator of the group associated with the evolution .",
    "thus we have identified the basic ingredients appearing in the schrdinger picture of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is important to remark the presence of the new fundamental constant @xmath19 in the description of this class of phenomena .",
    "it implies some fundamentally new aspects of the quantum theory with respect to the classical theory .",
    "for instance it is known that any measurement process requires an exchange of energy ( or information ) between the object we are measuring and the measurement apparatus .",
    "the presence of @xmath19 implies that these exchanges can not be made arbitrarily small and therefore idealized to be negligible .",
    "thus , in the measurement process , we can not conceive of a sharp separation between the `` object '' and the `` apparatus '' , so that we can disregard the apparatus altogether .",
    "moreover , in the measuring process , there is an inherent ambiguity in the `` cut '' between what we identify as `` object '' and what we identify as the `` apparatus '' .",
    "the problem of measurement in quantum theory is a very deep one and goes beyond the scope of these notes .",
    "we may simple mention that within the von neumann formulation of quantum mechanics the `` measurement '' gives rise to the so called `` collapse of the wave function '' .",
    "when we measure some dynamical variable ( i.e. a physical quantity ) , the wave function which represents the system is projected onto one of the eigenstates of the operator @xmath20 with a probability that can be computed .",
    "however we shall not insist on these problem any longer and move to the general mathematical structures emerging in the description of quantum mechanical systems .",
    "while we shall deal mainly with finite dimensional hilbert spaces , we are going to consider very briefly the weyl - wigner formalism in infinite dimensions and mention the tomographic formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the reason is that this formulation is the most suitable for the study of the quantum - classical transition .    before closing this introduction and to better put into perspective the schrdinger and the heisenberg pictures",
    ", we are going to make a few general considerations on the minimal mathematical structures required for the description of a physical system . from a minimalist point of view",
    ", we identify three main ingredients :    * a space of states , which we define as @xmath21 , * a space of observables , which we denote as @xmath22 , * a real valued pairing @xmath23 .",
    "this pairing produces a real number out of a state and an observable , and it is associated with the measurement process . to be more precise , @xmath24 , for @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ", will be a probability measure on the borel subsets of @xmath27 .",
    "it is not difficult to identify these objects in the framework of classical dynamics or of classical statistical mechanics . in quantum mechanics we have two prevailing pictures :    * the schrdinger picture . in this case @xmath21",
    "is identified with the vectors of a hilbert space @xmath15 , while the set of dynamical variables ( the observables ) is a derived concept : they are identified with self - adjoint operators acting on @xmath15 . * the heisenberg picture .",
    "here the situation is complementary : the set of dynamical variables ( the observables ) is the primary concept .",
    "observables are assumed to be the real elements of a @xmath28algebra @xmath29 .",
    "the states are then a derived concept and are defined as a proper subset of the space of linear functionals on @xmath29 .      in this picture",
    "the relevant carrier space is a hilbert space @xmath30 .",
    "very often , it is realized as a space of square - integrable complex valued functions defined on some spatial domain @xmath31 , identified with the configuration space of our system .",
    "this configuration space turns out to be the configuration space of the physical system that we would identify in the quantum - classical transition when considering the so - called * classical limit * defined as @xmath32 .",
    "states are unitary vectors , which are identified when they differ by multiplication by a complex number of modulus one ( i.e. an overall phase ) .",
    "this implies an equivalence relation on @xmath30 : given @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath30 satisfying @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 as a result , physical states are identified with points in the complex projective space associated to @xmath30 .",
    "we shall denote it as @xmath37 or occasionally @xmath38 ( meaning the space of rays of @xmath30 ) .",
    "the corresponding equivalence classes will be denoted as @xmath39=\\ { \\phi\\in \\hil | \\phi\\sim \\psi \\}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , observables are defined as self - adjoint operators acting on @xmath30 .",
    "the pairing between states and observables is defined in terms of the hermitian structure of @xmath30 : with any pair @xmath40 , a)$ ] we associate the expectation value function @xmath41 and defined as @xmath42)=\\frac{\\langle \\psi , a\\psi\\rangle}{\\langle \\psi , \\psi\\rangle},\\ ] ] it is clear that the right hand side depends only on the equivalence class @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "we are using here , as in the rest of the paper , the bra - ket notation of dirac @xcite .",
    "evolution is defined on the hilbert space @xmath30 by means of the scrdinger equation @xmath44    we can elaborate a little on this equation .",
    "consider now the equation for the complex conjugate and transpose of the wave function : @xmath45 where the reality of @xmath14 has been used .    combining both equation , it is immediate to see that , at the level of the hilbert space : @xmath46 which appears as a continuity equation .",
    "to be specific we consider the hilbert space realized in terms of wave functions and the hamiltonian operator as a differential operator associated with a particle moving in a potential @xmath47 , we find : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the laplacian operator defined on @xmath12 and @xmath50 is the multiplication operator @xmath51    as we have mentioned , the presence of the configuration space @xmath12 in the realization of the hilbert space @xmath30 in terms of square integrable functions on @xmath12 incorporates some shadows of the classical limit . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if we introduce the polar form of the wave function as @xmath52 where @xmath20 and @xmath53 are real valued functions and @xmath54 , we decompose the complex linear schrdinger equation into two nonlinear and coupled differential equations . here",
    "the equation for @xmath53 contains an additional `` quantum potential '' @xmath55 i.e. @xmath56    the other equation takes the form of a continuity equation for the probability distribution @xmath57 : @xmath58    the vector field associated with the wave function @xmath9 : @xmath59 is the extra ingredient of bohmian mechanics ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us indulge now on the integration of the schrdinger equation .",
    "when the hamiltonian operator does not depend explicitly on time , i.e. it is time - translation invariant , we may use the separation of variables and consider @xmath60    we thus get the helmholtz equation associated with the schrdinger equation : @xmath61    one solves for this equation in terms of an `` eigenvalue problem '' with preassigned initial conditions ( boundary conditions ) and finds , for suitable potentials , a set of fundamental solutions which provide also a basis for the hilbert space , say @xmath62 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath63 a general solution for our quantum problem will thus have the form : @xmath64 with @xmath65 allowing to determine @xmath66 up to an overall phase .",
    "for simplicity we have considered a situation where eigenvalues are not degenerate .",
    "the merit of the particular basis we have considered relies on the fact that on these vectors @xmath67 acts as a multiplication operator , i.e. as a diagonal matrix .",
    "let us elaborate a little more on this aspect in more general terms . to this aim",
    "it is convenient to go back to the abstract dirac notation in terms of bras and kets . thus starting with schrdinger equation @xmath68",
    "let us consider now an orthonormal basis for the hilbert space @xmath69 , with the property @xmath70    in this basis the hermitian structure is represented by the identity matrix .",
    "the orthogonality also allows to write the decomposition of the identity operator @xmath71    with the help of these bases we can write our initial schrdinger equation in the matrix form : @xmath72 now , by using the fact that @xmath73 are a basis , we get : @xmath74    denoting @xmath75 we can write the schrdinger equation as @xmath76    this equation would allow us to use all the results from matrix algebra if the matrices would be finite dimensional . as a matter of fact , this would be the case if for any chosen @xmath77 the number of indices @xmath78 coming into @xmath79 were finite .",
    "in geometrical terms this would mean that we can decompose the full hilbert space into the direct sum of invariant finite dimensional hilbert spaces . in this way",
    "the infinite dimensional matrix associated with the operator would decompose into a block diagonal form , each block being a finite dimensional matrix .",
    "thus the eigenvalue problem associated with the helmholtz equation is nothing but a way to find such an invariant decomposition of the hilbert space where , in addition , each finite dimensional block is a multiple of the identity , the multiplication factor being the eigenvalue of the corresponding eigenspace .",
    "this procedure gives rise to the well known spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "very often , an invariant decomposition of the full hilbert space will be associated with the decomposition into irreducible representations of a compact group of symmetries for the hamiltonian operator .    in conclusion ,",
    "the most convenient basis @xmath80 depends on the particular problem we are dealing with , and there are no general prescriptions .    of course , due to the role of the observer , or apparatus , or laboratory , a convenient basis from the point of view of interpretation ,",
    "is provided by the eigenstates of the particle s position vector operator @xmath81 ( whose components are the three commuting coordinate operators @xmath82 , defined as @xmath83 ) .",
    "this continuous basis satisfies some generalized orthonormality conditions , namely @xmath84    decomposing @xmath85 in the @xmath86 basis yields @xmath87    usually we write @xmath88 and this basis provides us with a clear interpretation of the wave function , i.e. the component of the abstract vector @xmath85 in the basis of the position operators .",
    "clearly the continuous index @xmath89 replaces previous discrete indices @xmath90 and integration replaces the summation .    the position representation is quite suitable for measurements of the particle s position . in other instances , as for instance the case of massless particles , the momentum representation is more convenient . in this case we use the momentum operator basis @xmath91 associated with the momentum operator @xmath92 : @xmath93    again a decomposition of the identity can be written with this basis :    @xmath94    each of these states can be decomposed in the position basis : @xmath95    thus the components of the momentum eigenstates , in the position representation , are given by plane - waves .",
    "therefore they are not square - integrable functions and can not be considered as elements of @xmath96 . in this formalism , to make sense of the eigenstates of the position or of the momentum operators , one usually deals with wave packets . these are usually written as : @xmath97 and @xmath4",
    "is written in terms of the momenta .",
    "the particular expression of @xmath4 in terms of the momenta is usually called the * dispersion relation * and the integral appearing in the momentum variables should be considered as taken on the submanifold defined by the dispersion relation .    the fourier transform which appears in going from one set ( of maximally commuting ) observables to a conjugate set ( of maximally commuting ) variables plays a very important role because it is a unitary transformation and therefore compatible with the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "moreover , from the mathematical point of view , we notice that the fourier transform represents the `` harmonic analysis '' on the abelian vector group .",
    "thus it is associated with translations in space - time or translations in the energy - momentum space @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to write now the evolution operator we mentioned above ( [ eq : evolution ] ) , when we consider the position representation .",
    "we find : @xmath98 i.e. @xmath99    here we have introduced the standard notation for the green function , the `` propagator '' which makes our initial state to evolve .",
    "it simply represents the matrix form of the evolution operator in the continuous basis @xmath86 ( in particular the matrix element @xmath100 ) .",
    "it is simple to see that at the initial time @xmath101 therefore these matrix elements become functions on @xmath102 ( @xmath103 being the configuration space ) . by using @xmath104 or @xmath105",
    ", we can find analogous matrix elements written as functions of the cotangent bundle @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath107 or @xmath108 respectively .",
    "the probabilistic interpretation we have considered in the introduction is now formalized by saying that when the state of our system is described by the wave function @xmath109 , the probability of finding the particle in the region @xmath110 at time @xmath2 , is given by @xmath111    the operator @xmath112 is a projection operator and may also be described by means of the characteristic function @xmath113    thus we can also write : @xmath114    similar formulae can also be written for the momentum representation or any other realization of the hilbert space in terms of square integrable functions .    up to here",
    ", we have been using the position operator representation or the momentum - operator representation and mentioned the possibility of using either one .",
    "one may wonder if the general aspects could be dealt with without making an a - priori choice of the representation .    as a matter of fact",
    ", it is indeed possible and this is what is done in the weyl - wigner formalism along with the further elaboration given by the tomographic formalism .",
    "the reduction to a specific representation is due to the requirement of irreducibility of the representation of the canonical commutation relations . in the following sections we shall briefly consider the weyl - wigner formalism , the canonical commutation relations and the emergence of these irreducible representations .",
    "a weyl system is defined on a symplectic vector space @xmath115 in the following way .",
    "it is a map @xmath116 from the symplectic vector space to unitary operators @xmath117 on some hilbert space @xmath30 .",
    "we require that this map defines a strongly continuous one - parameter group of transformations @xmath118 and that it satisfies the property @xmath119    strong continuity , by means of stone s theorem , implies the existence of an ( essentially ) selfadjoint operator @xmath120 such that @xmath121    a well - known theorem by von neumann establishes that for any finite - dimensional symplectic vector space a weyl system can always be obtained in terms of operators acting on square - integrable functions defined on any lagrangian subspace @xmath122 , with the translational invariant lebesgue measure @xmath123 .",
    "we recall that a lagrangian subspace of a symplectic vector space is a maximal vector subspace @xmath124 such that @xmath125 for any pair of vectors @xmath126 .",
    "maximality implies that any other vector @xmath127 such that @xmath128 for any @xmath129 must belong to @xmath124 .    it is immediately seen that when vectors @xmath130 are such that @xmath125 , the operators @xmath131 and @xmath132 commute .",
    "therefore , a lagrangian subspace arises as the joint spectrum of a maximal commuting set of unitary operators .    by using vectors @xmath133 , eigenvectors of the operators associated with vectors of @xmath124 ,",
    "we can write a decomposition of the identity @xmath134 and also @xmath135    within this setting , a weyl system can be constructed in the following way .",
    "we consider the lagrangian subspace @xmath122 and its cotangent bundle @xmath136 , which is endowed with the canonical symplectic form @xmath137 .",
    "now we construct a symplectomorphism @xmath138 thus we can write the elements of @xmath139 as pairs @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 . with this decomposition , weyl operators will be defined by their action on @xmath143 as @xmath144(y)=\\psi(x+y ) \\qquad x , y\\in l \\quad \\psi\\in",
    "\\l^2(l , \\mu_l)\\ ] ] @xmath145(y)=e^{i\\alpha(y)}\\psi(y ) \\qquad y\\in l , \\alpha\\in l^ * \\quad \\psi\\in",
    "\\l^2(l , \\mu_l).\\ ] ]    we know from stone s theorem that there exist infinitesimal generators for these transformations .",
    "we may introduce the operators @xmath146 where we use @xmath147 to represent the base vectors for @xmath124 and @xmath148 , i.e. @xmath149 , 1 being in the @xmath77th position .    with these operators ,",
    "the weyl map has the form : @xmath150    equivalently we could write instead :    @xmath151 or @xmath152    these various forms differ by multiplication by a complex number of modulus one and give rise to different `` orderings '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we select a complex structure on @xmath139 , defined by a tensor @xmath153 satisfying @xmath154 , we can define two operators    @xmath155    which will be called annihilation and creation operators respectively .",
    "also the natural symplectic structure @xmath156 can be written in the complex coordinates @xmath157 as @xmath158 trivially it follows that @xmath159 are coordinates of a lagrangian subspace , as well as @xmath160 .    in these coordinates",
    ", we have the weyl map given by @xmath161 in this form , weyl operators are called displacement operators and are used to construct `` coherent states '' .    by means of a symplectic linear transformation , @xmath162 such that @xmath163 , we may define an automorphism on the set of unitary operators by setting : @xmath164 because automorphisms of the unitary group are inner .",
    "thus with a one - parameter group of linear homogeneous symplectic transformations , we define a one - parameter group of unitary transformations . as symplectic linear transformations have an infinitesimal generator associated with a quadratic function on @xmath139 ,",
    "the corresponding infinitesimal generator of the unitary transformation ( stone s theorem ) shall be the operator associated with the quadratic function on @xmath139 .",
    "in conclusion we obtain :    we can associate self - adjoint operators with quadratic functions on @xmath139 .    by using the set of complex coordinates introduced above , and the association @xmath165 we can construct the automorphism @xmath166    by using the vacuum state @xmath167 as a fiducial vector , defined for instance as @xmath168 , we may set a one - to - one correspondence between hermitian operators and functions on @xmath139 by setting : @xmath169 this function is known as the * berezin symbol * of the operator @xmath20 and allows to define an invertible mapping between hilbert - schmidt operators and square integrable functions on @xmath139 .",
    "we should also remark that the map @xmath170 is a way to immerse @xmath171 ( the phase space ) , as a submanifold ( or a subset ) of the hilbert space @xmath30 ( say , the fock space ) .",
    "but it is not a linear map onto the image .",
    "if we consider the expectation value functions @xmath172 we may pull - back them to @xmath171 by considering : @xmath173    another important point regards the algebraic structures on the sets . as the mapping ( [ eq : f_a ] ) is one - to - one , it is possible to associate a function to the product of two operators , and thus define a binary operation on functions associated with operators by setting @xmath174    when we pull - back this product to the phase space ( i.e. define @xmath175 ) , we get a @xmath176product very close to the usual moyal product ( @xcite ) . as a matter of fact @xmath177",
    "and thus we can recover the poisson bracket ( associated to the symplectic form @xmath6 ) on phase space .",
    "let us summarize then the results presented so far :    * weyl maps are applications from a symplectic vector space @xmath178 to the set of unitary operators of some hilbert space @xmath117 satisfying two properties : * * the map is strongly continuous , * * @xmath179 for any @xmath180 .",
    "* stone s theorem allows us to define the infinitesimal generator of the unitary transformation corresponding to the vector @xmath181 .",
    "we denote this infinitesimal generator as @xmath182 : @xmath183 the condition above implies that @xmath184=i\\hbar \\omega(v_1 , v_2 ) \\qquad \\forall v_1 , v_2\\in v\\ ] ] * if we realize the symplectic vector space @xmath139 as the cotangent bundle ( with its canonical symplectic form ) of some lagrangian submanifold @xmath122 , i.e. @xmath185 ; we can write the expression of the weyl map as : @xmath186 where the operators @xmath187 and @xmath188 via stone s theorem and have an associated action on the elements of @xmath143 as @xmath189 * we can also introduce the set of complex coordinates @xmath190 and write the expression of the weyl map as @xmath191 for @xmath192 and @xmath193 the creation and annihilation operators ( [ eq : creat - anhil ] ) .",
    "let us elaborate a little further and consider a similar construction , but having as initial set the poisson vector space @xmath194 , i.e. the dual space @xmath195 and the poisson tensor @xmath196 defined from the symplectic form @xmath6 as : @xmath197 for @xmath198 the element of @xmath199 defined as @xmath200    with these elements , we define the weyl map as an application @xmath201 being strongly continuous , and satisfying the condition @xmath202    if we use this as our starting point , we may define weyl systems also for degenerate poisson structures .",
    "this turns out to be very useful when we deal with constrained systems in the sense of dirac and bergmann @xcite .",
    "consider again the symplectic vector space @xmath115 and a linear transformation @xmath162 .",
    "we can define a new tensor : @xmath203 if @xmath204 is invertible , @xmath205 is again a symplectic form .",
    "we can thus associate a weyl system to the new symplectic form @xmath205 , in the form : @xmath206_t\\ar[rr]^w & & u(\\hil ) \\ar[dd]^{\\nu_t } \\\\ \\\\ ( v , \\omega_t)\\ar[rr]_{w_t } & & u(\\hil ) } \\ ] ] as the diagram is commutative , @xmath207 .    at the infinitesimal level",
    ", we have that @xmath208 and therefore @xmath209 is not hermitian with respect to the hermitian structure on @xmath30 which makes @xmath210 unitary .",
    "hence , this is a situation where @xmath209 may have a real spectrum without being hermitian .",
    "this situation has been considered in the literature as the one using pseudo - hermitian operators ( @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath204 is a symplectic transformation , and hence @xmath211 , the transformation @xmath212 is an inner automorphism : @xmath213    if we consider now a one - parameter family of linear symplectic transformations @xmath214 , where @xmath215 ; we know that the infinitesimal generator of this family is a hamiltonian vector field . as the transformation is linear",
    ", we also know that the associated hamiltonian function is quadratic .",
    "but we can also consider the infinitesimal generator of the associated unitary transformation @xmath216 .",
    "this infinitesimal generator will be a self - adjoint operator on @xmath30 , which is thus associated to the quadratic hamiltonian function on @xmath139 which generated the family of linear symplectic transformations .",
    "as an example , if we consider the transformation @xmath217 the associated unitary operator is given by the fourier transform .",
    "let us consider now the heisenberg - weyl lie algebra @xmath218 defined as @xmath219=\\omega(v_1 , v_2);\\ ] ] and its holomorph , i.e. the extension of the algebra with its derivation algebra .",
    "let us recall that the derivation algebra of a lie algebra is the set of linear transformations @xmath220 which satisfy : @xmath221)=[a(v_1 ) , v_2]+[v_1 , a(v_2)].\\ ] ] in the present situation , this corresponds to the algebra of infinitesimal canonical transformations of @xmath139 .",
    "if we consider then this extension of the heisenberg - weyl algebra , the weyl construction shows that the entire associated lie group can be represented by unitary operators on the hilbert space on which the weyl operators act .",
    "we have seen that our previous construction is able to provide a unitary operator to represent any function of @xmath139 which is at most quadratic .",
    "what can be said for more general functions ?",
    "the trick elaborated by weyl was the following .",
    "consider the realization @xmath185 which assigns a pair @xmath222 to any element @xmath223 .",
    "now , we can consider the double fourier transform of a function @xmath224 as @xmath225    now define the operator @xmath226 associated to the function @xmath227 as @xmath228    this map can be inverted , i.e. we can find a map from operators acting on @xmath30 onto functions defined on @xmath139 , such that it is an involutive map of index two .",
    "the inverse , namely the function @xmath229 associated to an operator @xmath20 on the hilbert space , can be written as : @xmath230 we might also use the symplectic fourier transform @xmath231    if we apply this to the density operator associated to a pure state @xmath232 , @xmath233 , we obtain : @xmath234 this is called the * wigner function * associated to the state @xmath235 .    we can conclude thus with the following statement :    the wigner - weyl map defines a bijection between hilbert - schmidt operators and square - integrable functions on phase space .",
    "if we also denote by @xmath53 the map @xmath236 ( i.e. applied to functions on @xmath139 ) , we can use the bijection to transport the associative product of the @xmath237weyl algebra generated by unitary operators on @xmath30 onto the set of functions on @xmath139 .",
    "this defines the @xmath238product we saw above : @xmath239    this is the integral form of the moyal product , which is usually written in terms of bidifferential operators    @xmath240    or equivalently @xmath241    it should be clear now that all descriptions in terms of operators have a counterpart in terms of complex valued functions on the phase space with the moyal product .",
    "for instance , we can write the eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian of our quantum system as : @xmath242 where @xmath14 is the function corresponding to the hamiltonian operator and @xmath243 is the function representing the eigenstate with energy @xmath4 .",
    "similarly we can write evolution equations and their exponentiation as a taylor expansion in terms of @xmath238products .",
    "the wigner function associated to a state @xmath9 was introduced in 1932 as a tool for the study of quantum corrections to classical equilibrium distributions @xcite . however , unlike the distribution function of classical statistical mechanics which is a probability distribution function on phase space , the wigner function is only a quasi - distribution , i.e. it is not positive definite .",
    "the tomogram description of quantum mechanics uses a formulation in which the quantum state is described by conventional non - negative probability distributions .",
    "thus , within this formulation both the classical and the quantum descriptions of a physical system use true probability distributions , and this property makes easier to compare predictions of the two descriptions . moreover",
    ", it makes also easier to deal with the quantum - classical transition because the describing functions are defined on the same carrier space .",
    "we shall not enter in this fascinating subject , but instead refer to some previous work to find details on this formulation in the same spirit of these notes @xcite",
    "to consider quantum mechanics from a differential geometric point of view , it is convenient to consider the hilbert space @xmath30 as a real differential manifold . in order to do this",
    ", we have to convert the hermitian inner product @xmath244 which defines @xmath30 into an hermitian tensor .",
    "this is quite similar to what we do in the transition from special relativity to general relativity . in that case , the minkowski product @xmath245 is replaced by the tensor @xmath246 and thus space - time becomes a manifold whose tangent space becomes endowed with a minkowskian product . in the present case ,",
    "the hilbert space @xmath30 is replaced by a hilbertian manifold , whose tangent space is a hilbert space with the inner product @xmath244 .    to be definite ,",

    "and we can define the hermitian bracket as a combination of the above products : @xmath265      we may use the set of real coordinate functions introduced in the previous section to write explicitly the complex structure of @xmath30 .",

    "this also can be encoded in a tensor , a vector field in this case , which is the dilation vector field @xmath268 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath269 and hence takes the coordinate expression : @xmath270    the complex and the linear structures can be thus combined as @xmath271 which is the infinitesimal generator of the multiplication by a phase .",
    "let us go back now to the problem of the star product at the level of the functions .",
    "consider an operator @xmath20 on @xmath30 and the evaluation functions @xmath272 and the expectation value function @xmath273    the @xmath238product which translates the associative algebra structure of the set of operators reads @xmath274 and @xmath275 where @xmath276 and @xmath277 ( we shall go back to these objects in the next sections ) .    a * khlerian function * is a function @xmath227 such that the hamiltonian vector field @xmath278 , @xmath279 , is also a killing vector field , i.e. @xmath280    on khlerian functions , @xmath281 defines a jordan algebra structure , while @xmath196 defines a lie structure .",
    "both structures are compatible ( they define a structure called * lie - jordan * algebra @xcite ) and together define the @xmath237algebra corresponding to bounded operators .",

    "let us consider now the relation with the notion of gelfand transform .",
    "the gelfand transform of an operator @xmath20 is defined as @xmath291 the gelfand transform @xmath292 is a linear involutive preserving injection of @xmath287 into @xmath293 . for @xmath294 , @xmath295 and @xmath296",
    "the range of the transform is the set @xmath297      we already saw above that from a physical point of view , the probabilistic interpretation requires that the set of states of a system is not a vector space but a complex projective one .",
    "our aim now is to present the geometrical structures arising in this case .",
    "first let us study the expression of the hermitian tensor in @xmath37 .",
    "it is simple to obtain a hermitian tensor field on @xmath30 which vanishes on vertical vector fields ( generated by @xmath49 and @xmath298 ) and provides a projectable function when evaluated on projectable vector fields : @xmath299    from a geometrical point of view , the complex projective space is obtained as the quotient manifold obtained from the hilbert space @xmath30 with respect to the foliation generated by two vector fields :    * the dilation vector field @xmath300 , and * the phase - change vector field obtained as the vector field resulting from the action of the complex structure @xmath266 on @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath301 .",
    "this vector field is the hamiltonian vector field ( with respect to the canonical poisson structure @xmath196 of the function @xmath302 , associated with the unity operator @xmath303 ..    from this observation it is simple now to study , from a geometrical point of view , the projection of the contravariant tensors introduced on @xmath30 to the complex projective space .",
    "we need to consider contravariant tensors and functions which are invariant under the action of @xmath304 and @xmath49 .    from this perspective",
    ", it is simple to see that the functions @xmath41 that we have associated with operators @xmath20 are trivially projectable . on the other hand",
    ", it is simple to see ( from the coordinate expressions , for instance ) that the tensors @xmath281 and @xmath196 are homogeneous of degree -2 , and hence non - projectable .",
    "the homogeneity consideration is useful , though , to modify them by a conformal factor and make them projectable .",
    "thus the objects @xmath305 define projectable tensors .",
    "particularly the issue on the poisson tensor has some deep implications from a geometrical point of view .",
    "we may use the two tensors above to realize the @xmath237algebra of operators on @xmath30 as a @xmath237algebra of functions on the complex projective space . with the help of these functions we can formulate the eigenvalue problem on the complex projective space considered as a real manifold , and write the equations of motion corresponding to the heisenberg formulation of the evolution equations .",
    "thanks to the wigner s theorem , it is possible to solve the equations of the motion on the hilbert space , by exponentiation for instance , and then to project the result onto the ray space to obtain the desired solutions .",
    "more likely it is because of this property that physicists have not bothered dealing with quantum mechanics on the ray space considered as a real manifold .      to end this quick description of the basics of the geometrical description of quantum mechanics",
    ", we will now consider another important aspect , here worked out for a specific example .",
    "given the hilbert space @xmath306 ( or equivalently the corresponding projective space @xmath37 ) , we know that there is an action of the unitary group @xmath307 on them . with respect to the canonical symplectic structure of @xmath15 this action is strongly symplectic ( @xcite ) , and therefore admits a momentum map @xmath308 or equivalently @xmath309 .",

    "this implies that the geometric structures that we know on @xmath37 must have an analogue on @xmath319 .",

    "one important fact is the isomorphism @xmath321 given by the killing - cartan metric .",
    "indeed , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the elements of the lie algebra and the elements of its dual and this correspondence intertwines the adjoint and the coadjoint actions .",
    "we shall denote as @xmath322 the element of @xmath319 corresponding to the observable @xmath323 for @xmath324 .",
    "besides , as the set of physical observables in this case corresponds to the set of linear functions on @xmath319(@xmath325 ) , we can use the pullback @xmath326 to relate the set of hermitian operators and the set of functions defined on the hilbert space .",
    "the geometrical structures are also related , defining suitable morphisms :    * the momentum map is equivariant with respect to the action of @xmath117 on @xmath327 and the coadjoint action of @xmath117 on @xmath328 .",

    "may be found in @xcite , we shall consider now some specific examples which will illustrate the general picture .",
    "we have seen how the momentum map @xmath318 allows us to embed the complex projective space @xmath342 on the dual of the lie algebra @xmath329 .",
    "the resulting elements represent the set of pure states of the quantum system .",
    "but in many physical situations we have more general states , i.e. density states which are convex combinations of pure states .",
    "they are represented by a family @xmath343 , each element satisfying @xmath344 along with a probability vector , namely @xmath345 with @xmath346 and @xmath347 .",

    "and we hence consider the geometric structure we defined on @xmath351 as the poisson or the jordan brackets @xmath352_-}(\\psi_k ) = \\sum_kp_k\\ { f_a , f_b\\ } ( \\psi _ k ) \\nonumber    \\\\",

    "on this space the two structures above ( [ eq : poissonjjordan ] ) , define a poisson and a `` riemannian '' structure .",
    "the poisson structure is degenerate .",
    "however it is also possible to define a generalized complex structure satisfying @xmath354    the boundary is a stratified manifold , corresponding to the union of symplectic orbits of @xmath355 of different dimensions , passing through density matrices of not maximal rank .",

    "the set of physical states is not equal to @xmath356 , since we have to consider the equivalence relation given by the multiplication by a complex number i.e. @xmath360 and besides , the norm of the state must be equal to one .",
    "these two properties can be encoded in the following diagram : @xmath361^\\pi\\ar[dr ] & & s^2 \\\\ & s^3\\ar[ur]_{\\tau_h } & } \\ ] ] where @xmath362 and @xmath363 stand for the two and three dimensional spheres , and the projection @xmath364 is the hopf fibration .",
    "the projection @xmath365 is associating each vector with the one - dimensional complex vector space to which it belongs .",

    "this amounts to : @xmath390    this condition , plus the compatibility between the associator and the poisson bracket implies that the two brackets combined define a lie - jordan algebra .    in particular , by considering generic quadratic functions of two complex coordinates",

    "these results are related to those of rajeev ( @xcite ) .",
    "entanglement is a property of composite physical systems which plays a very important role in many different phenomena , but in particular , it has become a crucial issue of quantum computation and quantum information theory . despite the growing interest in recent years , it was already discussed by schrdinger and the `` founding fathers '' of quantum theory in the early years of quantum theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "roughly speaking , entanglement is the situation complementary to separability    let @xmath232 be state of a hilbert space @xmath457 of a bipartite system .",
    "then , @xmath232 is said to be * separable * if there exists a pair of states @xmath458 and @xmath459 satisfying @xmath460 .",
    "thus a state which is not separable is said to be entangled .",
    "but entanglement exhibits many interesting properties , for instance the fact that there is a gradation in the level of entanglement of the different states .",
    "thus we can measure the entanglement of a state by using physical quantities .",
    "these different observables are called * entanglement witnesses*.    usual choices to describe entanglement are the * concurrence * of the state , the * von neumann entropy * of one of its partial traces ( i.e. the entropy of the density state @xmath461 or of @xmath462 , where @xmath463 ) .",
    "the concurrence of a density matrix @xmath464 is defined as @xmath465 where @xmath466 corresponds to @xmath467 and @xmath468 stands for its largest eigenvalue .",
    "the von neumann entropy of a density matrix @xmath464 is defined as @xmath469 when the density matrix corresponds to a pure state , though , the function above vanishes .",
    "thus we define the corresponding entropy as the value of the function on the partial trace over one of the subsystems : @xmath470    on the other hand , if we consider the case of mixed states , the situation is not equally simple . in general , it is necessary to consider more than one entanglement witnesses in order to completely characterize the state of the system .",
    "one interesting question arises thus : how can we describe the independence of the different quantities we use ?    in the framework of classical mechanics this question is simple to answer .",
    "given two physical quantities , which are represented by two functions @xmath471 on phase - space , they are said to be independent at a point @xmath289 if their exterior differentials satisfy @xmath472    the usual approach to quantum mechanics , in terms of hilbert spaces or @xmath237algebras does not allow a similar treatment of the analogous quantum problem .",
    "we lack of a well developed non - commutative differential calculus which would allow to define a `` non - commutative '' exterior differential and therefore to extend the previous definition to the quantum setting @xcite    however the geometrical formalism we introduced in the previous sections allows us to look at the problem from a different perspective . treating the quantum state space as a real differential manifold",
    ", we do have a differential calculus at our disposal : the usual differential calculus of real manifolds .",
    "consider the hilbert space @xmath15 and an operator @xmath20 .",
    "we know that we can associate with @xmath20 the quadratic function @xmath473    in the geometric description of quantum mechanics we read from the set of quadratic functions the algebraic structures available on the set of operators :    * the associative product of operators is translated into the non - local product @xmath238 , * the lie algebra defined by the commutator is translated into the poisson algebra defined by the tensor @xmath196 * the jordan algebra given by the anticommutator is translated into the jordan algebra defined by the tensor @xmath281    but the geometric description also includes a pointwise algebra @xmath474 , which is commutative , and whose differential calculus is the standard one .",
    "this is the algebraic structure with respect to which we define the differential algebra we are interested in :    two observables @xmath20 and @xmath475 are said to be * functionally independent * if their associated functions satisfy @xmath476    this is a condition which is simple to test and exhibits a clear advantage offered by the geometric approach to the description of quantum systems , for there is no simple analogue of this structure in the usual framework .",
    "let us see how this works in a particular example where we can test the independence of von neumann entropy and the concurrence of our two qubit system :    now we will test this formalism with a particular example . consider for instance the family of density states defined by the matrices : @xmath477 as it is considered in @xcite .",
    "such a matrix represents a density state provided that @xmath478 this is clearly a @xmath479dimensional submanifold @xmath21 of @xmath480 .",
    "we can take an adapted basis for it , considering the matrices @xmath481    we can use the four real numbers @xmath482 as adapted coordinates on that submanifold .",
    "now we can evaluate the three functions above on these states .",
    "as we already know the expression of the jordan and the poisson bracket we can also obtain the corresponding hamiltonian and gradient vector fields . and",
    "besides , we can also study the independence of the functions by evaluating the expressions of @xmath483 where @xmath484 represents the exterior differential associated with the differential manifold constituted by @xmath440 .",
    "let us thus proceed :    * the value of the different functions is easy to obtain .",
    "we have that von neumann entropy reads , @xmath485+\\nonumber \\\\   & & \\left(a+b-\\sqrt{(a - b)^2+c^2}\\right ) \\log \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } \\left(a+b-\\sqrt{(a - b)^2+c^2}\\right)\\right]+ \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left(a+b+\\sqrt{(a - b)^2+c^2}\\right ) \\nonumber \\log\\left[\\frac{1}{2 } \\left(a+b+\\sqrt{(a - b)^2+c^2}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + the value of the concurrence is very simple : @xmath486 * we can study now the poisson brackets corresponding to them .",
    "it is simple to prove that these functions commute , i.e. @xmath487 this implies that the local transformations generated by them commute . * finally , we can study the independence of the different functions .",
    "this is an important issue , in particular the independence of the von neumann entropy and the concurrence , because it affects the description of entanglement of general quantum density states .",
    "we can prove the following : + the concurrence and the von neumann entropy of the family of states @xmath488 are not independent in all the space of density states .",
    "+ we are considering the submanifold of @xmath489 corresponding to the family of density states @xmath488 .",
    "+ thus the differential of the concurrence is trivial to obtain : @xmath490 the computation of the differential of the von neumann entropy is quite more involved .",
    "it is evident from the expression above that the functions @xmath21 depends on the three variables . but",
    "as @xmath491 depends only on @xmath492 , we have to consider only the @xmath192 and @xmath493 dependence in what regards the computation of @xmath494 .",
    "to this aim we compute : + @xmath495 + now , the condition for ( [ wq ] ) to be equal to zero corresponds to @xmath496 + and these conditions become @xmath497+\\text{log}\\left[a b-\\frac{c^2}{4}\\right]=0 \\quad \\text{log}\\left[4 a b - c^2\\right]-2 \\text{log}\\left[a+b+\\sqrt{(a - b)^2+c^2}\\right]=0\\ ] ] + these equations have a solution on @xmath498 + if we represent the condition for @xmath492 as a function of @xmath192 and @xmath493 we verify that it is well defined for all values of @xmath192 and @xmath493 ( we represent the function @xmath499 and the function @xmath500 , which corresponds to the evaluation on the submanifold @xmath501 ) .",
    "+    + thus we conclude that there is a nonempty subset of @xmath440 where the von neumann entropy functions and the concurrence function introduced above are not functionally independent .",
    "on any point outside this submanifold the two functions are indeed functionally independent .",
    "to summarize the exposition we would like to mention a few advantages and some potential applications of the geometric approach to quantum mechanics that we just presented to the field of quantum information theory and quantum control .      * a dynamical system on a khler manifold where the dynamical vector field is hamiltonian with respect to the canonical symplectic structure and is a killing vector for the riemannian metric . * a dynamical system defined as a derivation for an associative algebra endowed with a pair of operations which define a lie - jordan algebra on it .    in both cases ,",
    "the message is simple : the geometric framework provides an approach to quantum mechanics which is very close to the usual geometric framework of classical mechanics and many of the `` classical tools '' can therefore be used in the quantum domain .",
    "the most relevant is perhaps the differential structure encoded in the exterior differential calculus .",
    "such a structure has not a simple analogue in the usual quantum description , but provides a powerful tool to study important notions as the independence of operators , as we saw in the last section .",
    "also the passage to the projective space turns out to be a simple task for , up to some conformal factors whose meaning is clear in geometrical terms , the treatment of the projective theory is analogous to the one defined at the level of hilbert spaces .    but the analogies of the quantum and the classical frameworks have also some other deeper implications , particularly in the realm of quantum computation and quantum information theory .",
    "we have seen how the cases of one and two qubits and one qutrit can be perfectly described within the geometric approach in fairly simple terms .",
    "the geometric implications of entanglement is under study now , and we hope to be able to provide a detailed description in a short time . but also quantum channels , their capacities , the study of decoherence , etc are concepts with a simple translation in the geometric domain .",
    "we are presently addressing these issues and they will appear elsewhere .",
    "finally we would like to mention another advantage of the geometric description of quantum mechanics : the study of quantum control problems .",
    "geometric control theory is a well stablished theory which has provided very powerful tools to describe classical control systems . on the other hand",
    ", the usual description of quantum control problems makes difficult to translate or adapt those classical tools to the case of quantum systems .",
    "but once we have proved that quantum dynamical systems can be described using the same mathematics which is used in the classical case , the possibilities for application of classical geometric control theory seem to be quite rich . and",
    "this is even true for systems and phenomena purely quantum in origin , as the quantum zeno effect , whose applications to control problems are becoming an interesting topic @xcite ."
