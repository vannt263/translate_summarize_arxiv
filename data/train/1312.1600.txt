    "the importance of random walks and brownian motion @xcite , both in physics and in mathematics , needs not to be emphasized .",
    "a first version of quantum random walks @xcite was introduced two decades ago , with many potential applications , in particular to quantum information or quantum computing @xcite .",
    "their behaviors are drastically different from those of their classical ancestors in two respects at least : first their diffusive properties are affected by multiple quantum interferences , and second the quantum coin they use is only reshuffled but not reinitialized at each step which reinforces the effect of interferences .",
    "a new version of quantum random walks @xcite has recently been introduced with the aim of incorporating decoherence effects ( hence the name `` open '' quantum random walks ) .",
    "although subject to quantum effects , this later version keeps structural properties inherited from their classical analogues .",
    "in particular , a natural extension of it  a dilation  involves independent quantum coins at each steps , and as a consequence , it also naturally incorporates a quantum analogue of the notion of filtration , familiar in the theory of stochastic processes @xcite , together with a time arrow associated to the increase of available information which goes with it .",
    "this , in some cases , allows to talk about quantum trajectories of those walks , a notion which was partially lost in the original definition .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct `` open ''",
    "quantum brownian motions either as a time and space continuous scaling limit of open quantum random walks or as an extension of quantum parallelism on random walks .",
    "this yields quantum stochastic processes with ( we believe ) many potential , and hopefully interesting , mathematical properties  by construction they yield quantum processes with spatial structures , as other quantum stochastic processes they promote most of basic structures of classical stochastic processes to a non - commutative setting , etc .  and physical applications ",
    "they provide realizations of progressive non - demolition measurements , their quantum trajectories seem to possess a rich variety of distinct regimes , they can be used to model physical situations for open or out of equilibrium quantum systems , etc .",
    "these processes are different , but clearly related , to the quantum brownian motions modeled by quantum particles in contact with a thermal bath as in the caldeira - leggett model @xcite .",
    "as recently pointed out @xcite , a competition between ballistic and diffusive behaviors is at play on open quantum brownian motions .",
    "we shall elaborate on it in the last section .",
    "there is a change of regime , from ballistic to diffusion , which can be understood as follows . in some range of the parameter space , the external quantum coins , which we call probes ,",
    "induce mesoscopic measurements of the internal walker gyroscope . as the characteristic time of these mesoscopic measurements",
    "is shortened these measurements become sharper and sharper , and this induces projections of the internal gyroscope state intertwined with bohr quantum jumps @xcite .",
    "the ballistic regime is a consequence of this phenomena .",
    "one of the simplest way to grasp what open quantum brownian motions could be is probably to start from a description of what quantum parallelized random walks could lead to , and this is the purpose of the two following ( and hopefully pedagogical ) sub - sections .",
    "the manuscript aims are more precisely presented in the third sub - section of this introduction , and depending on her / his taste , the reader may choose to read these sub - sections in the order she / he prefers .",
    "let us first have a look at standard random walks but with a quantum mechanically biased view .",
    "we consider a random walker that we view as a quantum system and suppose that the evolution of this particle is given by the following iterated scheme . at each time step , the walker is coupled with another system which we call a probe .",
    "these probes are going to play the role of ( quantum ) coins and they are renewed at each time step .",
    "we assume the space of probe states is @xmath24 and we pick an orthonormal basis which we denote by @xmath25 . for a random walk on the line",
    "we introduce the walker state space @xmath26 with specified basis @xmath27 , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "the elementary evolution is then with @xmath30 the initial state of the probe .",
    "we shall however imagine all probes initially prepared in the same state , and we do not write it explicitly here . ] , @xmath31 we view it as a map from @xmath26 to @xmath32 , preserving the normalization of the state .",
    "we then imagine iterating this process ( which physically may be obtained as a result of iterated interactions between the walker and a series of probes ) .",
    "after @xmath33 iterations , we get a state in @xmath34 . to make this clearer , consider a walker starting at position @xmath35 and iterating trice the elementary evolution .",
    "the total system ( walker + probes ) state @xmath36 is then : @xmath37 on this example we see that the resulting entangled state is the sum of states which are tensor products of a walker state at a localized position with a probe state in @xmath38 in one - to - one correspondence with a walk of length @xmath39 ending at this position .",
    "this sum saturates all possible walks of length three .",
    "this structure will clearly persist after @xmath33 iterations , so that the states after @xmath33 iterations can written as follows : @xmath40 } { | x_n([\\omega_n ] ) \\rangle } \\otimes{| [ \\omega_n ] \\rangle } \\ ] ] where the sum is over all walks @xmath41 $ ] of length @xmath33 , starting at @xmath35 and with position @xmath42)$ ] at their @xmath43 step , and @xmath44 \\rangle } $ ] are orthogonal vectors associated to each walk .",
    "this linear rewriting is what is called  quantum parallelism \" .",
    "this can be done in a more abstract or axiomatic way forgetting about repeated interactions .",
    "let us once again consider a walker on a discrete line described by its position @xmath45 .",
    "we can then decide to add a hilbert space where we store the history of the process , i.e. its full trajectory .",
    "if we call @xmath44 \\rangle } $ ] a basis of states corresponding to a given trajectory , we can simply decompose it into a product of fictitious probes encoding for every single increment of the trajectory , @xmath46 \\rangle } : = { | \\pm \\rangle } \\otimes ...",
    "\\otimes{| \\pm \\rangle } , \\ ] ] which then formally gives our previous picture .",
    "the state ( [ eq : parallel ] ) enables us to book - keep all possible walks in an algebraic way . at this point",
    "there is no more information in this sum than in the classical description of random walks .",
    "it also codes the probability of realization of any given sample : the probability of occurrence of the walk @xmath41 $ ] is the modulus square of the coefficient in front of @xmath47 ) \\rangle } \\otimes{| [ \\omega_n ] \\rangle } $ ] .",
    "these probabilities sum to one thanks the normalization of @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "this can be viewed from a quantum measurement perspective .",
    "imagine measuring the observable @xmath50 on each of the probes , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . ] .",
    "the output of the measurement of one probe is one of the @xmath50 eigen - values @xmath53 .",
    "the output of the series of measurements of all probes is a sequence of pluses and minuses , which are in bijection with the classical trajectories @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "by von neumann rules for quantum measurement , the probability of getting a given sequence @xmath41 $ ] as results of these measurements on state @xmath48 is the modulus square of the coefficient in front of @xmath47 ) \\rangle } \\otimes{| [ \\omega_n ] \\rangle } $ ] .",
    "that is , von neumann measurement on probes induces the appropriate measure on random walks .    up to now , all this seems very formal and it may seem that the quantum rewriting did not add anything . in this paper",
    "we will observe genuine quantum effects by considering only slight extensions of this model .",
    "we will first allow for probe measurements that are not aligned with the basis vectors .",
    "the measurement results will not be in one - to - one correspondence with walker trajectories anymore and the position will not be well defined either .",
    "we will call this simple generalization _ tilted random walks _ and study them first without any further complication in the next sub - section .",
    "this quantum rewriting is also useful to introduce some non markovian effects .",
    "adding new internal degrees of freedom , we will give a different weight to the trajectories and thus make the process path dependent .",
    "this is made possible thanks to linearity axiom of quantum mechanics",
    ". this will be the route to open quantum random walks and their continuous limit , open quantum brownian motions .",
    "in this extension  which may pompously be named `` non commutative ''  , we will still be able to measure the probes which will give quantum trajectories , or average over them which will give quantum dynamical maps , or keep them all to allow for any further measurement or manipulation which will give quantum stochastic processes .",
    "let us consider the simplest example of what we call tilted random walks .",
    "we consider the exact same model as before but allow for different probe measurements .",
    "we are going to show that the notion of trajectory is lost , as usual in quantum mechanics , but that surprisingly tilted random walks carry out progressive von neumann measurements @xcite of the walker momentum .",
    "we write @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , the walker state after @xmath56 steps assuming that we have already measured the @xmath56 first probes - first probes ) is actually of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the results of the measurement on the @xmath59-th probe .",
    "we do not write explicitly the state @xmath60 as it is frozen at later time and does not play a role anymore . ] .",
    "we replace the infinite line by a circle so that @xmath61 and impose periodic boundary conditions on @xmath62 . by linearity of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the evolution is : @xmath63    we now assume that we measure the probe observable with normalized eigen - vectors : @xmath64 this corresponds to measuring the observable @xmath65 , i.e. the probe effective spin along a tilted direction @xmath66 oriented with angles @xmath67 and @xmath68 on the sphere .",
    "the outputs of these measurements are still @xmath53 .",
    "after the tilted measurement of the @xmath56-th probe , the walker state is up - dated by von neumann rules to the normalized state proportional to @xmath69 , because the probe state has to be projected @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 with probability ( by von neumann rules ) , @xmath72 these probabilities are that of getting @xmath53 as result of the tilted measurement of the @xmath56-th probe . for @xmath73 or @xmath74 ,",
    "this reproduces standard random walks because then @xmath75 or @xmath76 and symmetrically @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "notice that , even if we initially started with a state localized at a given lattice position , after only one iteration the walker state is not localized anymore and will never be localized again ( for @xmath79 ) .",
    "hence we can not talk about walker trajectories ( although we simply started from random walks but quantum parallelized ) .",
    "the system is translation invariant and this suggests to use discrete fourier transforms .",
    "writing @xmath80 for the number of lattice sites , we use the convention that @xmath81 , with @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the momentum probability distribution at time @xmath56 .",
    "we then get a simple evolution for the discrete wave function in momentum space , @xmath84 \\phi_{k , t},\\ ] ] with probability @xmath85 , as defined above , which can written as , @xmath86\\big).\\ ] ]    we now compute the expectation of @xmath87 conditional on the past up to time @xmath56 , which we denote as @xmath88 $ ] . from eq.([eq : recurrw ] ) we get : @xmath89 \\big|\\phi_{k , t}\\big|^2\\ ] ] when computing the conditional expectation we have to sum over all possible values of @xmath87 , conditioned on the values of @xmath83 weighted by their probabilities of occurrence ( which are @xmath85 ) . hence , these probabilities in the denominator and in the numerator cancel out , and we get : @xmath90 = |\\phi_{k , t}|^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the process ( [ eq : recurrw ] ) is defined on the probability space consisting of all possible measurement outputs , and @xmath91 is the natural filtration associated to the probe measurement results up to time @xmath56 .",
    "eq.([eq : phymartin ] ) then tells us that @xmath92 is a bounded martingale ( it is bounded because @xmath93 ) @xcite .     in two samples of",
    "tilted random walk ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) starting with an identical but generic initial condition consisting in the sum of four gaussian distributions ( red curves ) .",
    "after @xmath96 iterations the intermediate distributions ( blue curves ) are more concentrated but still show a few peaks .",
    "the final distributions ( black curves , computed after @xmath97 steps ) are single dirac peaks but randomly located.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in two samples of tilted random walk ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) starting with an identical but generic initial condition consisting in the sum of four gaussian distributions ( red curves ) .",

    "the final distributions ( black curves , computed after @xmath97 steps ) are single dirac peaks but randomly located.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this result is remarkable because we then learn by the martingale convergence theorem @xcite that @xmath83 converges almost surely at large time to a random value which we denote by @xmath98 .",
    "see fig.[fig : col ] .",
    "we now argue that is supported on an interval of length smaller than @xmath99 . ] , this limiting momentum distribution is peaked at a random target @xmath100 : @xmath101 , with @xmath102 $ ] , are non zero ( for @xmath103 ) , there exists a subsequence of times @xmath104 ( resp .",
    "@xmath105 ) going to infinity such that the measurement outputs at times @xmath104 ( resp .",

    "can have support on pairs of momenta differing by @xmath111 .",
    "however , if the length of the support of the initial momentum distribution @xmath113 is smaller than @xmath99 , then only one peak remains ( because if @xmath113 vanishes initially it is null at any later time ) .",
    "] to this equation , with latexmath:[$\\sum_k    which relies on the infinite number of apparitions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , is only of heuristic value .",
    "the tricky point is that the outcomes are not independent random variables .",
    "but they are exchangeable , and de finetti s theorems ( see e.g. the second reference in @xcite ) give a rigorous justification of the result . ] at a random momentum @xmath100 , as in eq.([eq : moment ] ) .",
    "hence , for any tilted quantum trajectory the momentum distribution @xmath83 collapses almost surely to a dirac mass at a random momentum @xmath100 which we may view as the result of a momentum measurement .",
    "the convergence is also in @xmath115 , and because @xmath83 is a martingale , the probability of convergence towards a given momentum is the initial spectral momentum density at this point ( because @xmath116=|\\phi_{k , t=0}|^2 $ ] by the martingale property ) .",
    "that is , @xmath117= |\\phi_{k , t=0}|^2 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this is in accordance with von neumann rules for quantum measurement of the momentum .",
    "thus tilted random walks provide realizations of progressive measurements of the walker momentum observable .",
    "this is similar to progressive non - demolition measurements analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the construction of open quantum brownian motions ( open qbm ) starting from open quantum random walks ( open qrw ) by generalizing the quantum parallelism on random walks explained above .",
    "the main difference is that the walkers , still interacting with series of probes , now carry extra internal degrees of freedom which are going to behave as effective gyroscopes determining the direction of walker displacements .",
    "we are going to start from a discrete setting adapted to open qrw and then take the scaling limit which yields time and space continuous quantum processes , the open qbm .",
    "next section is devoted to open qrw .",
    "the four following ones deal with open qbm along different facets : quantum trajectories ( when measuring probes ) , quantum dynamical maps ( when keeping no track of the result of the probe measurements ) , and quantum stochastic differential equations ( when neither tracing out the probe degrees of freedom nor measuring them ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an introduction to quantum trajectories , to @xcite for quantum dynamical maps , to @xcite for quantum stochastic differential equations , and to @xcite for general introductions to the theory of open quantum system and quantum stochastic processes . from some perspectives , the quantum stochastic differential equations ( quantum sde ) , or quantum stochastic noises , encompass the other facets because the latter are reduction of the former .",
    "but this is not the complete picture , as we are going to illustrate , because the quantum sde can be reconstructed from the quantum trajectories or the quantum dynamical maps with tiny input hypothesis .",
    "since it is more natural from both quantum mechanical and probability points of view , we choose to order the presentation by starting with quantum trajectory and quantum dynamical map and then quantum sde .",
    "the last section is devoted to the particular case in which the internal gyroscope is a two level system . even in this most simple case ,",
    "open qbm possesses a rich structure with an interplay between ballistic and diffusive behaviors .    besides constructing the open qbm ,",
    "one of the other aims of this manuscript is to present from a biased theoretical physics point of view ( with a mixture of quantum mechanics , probability theory and field theory ) different aspects of quantum stochastic processes and their classical reductions .",
    "some of the results we present in a context adapted to open qbm may be transposed to other quantum stochastic processes .",
    "some of the relations we develop are known in different scientific communities  and some are new  but we adopt ( or we believe that we adopt ) a different point of view closer to field theory , and as a consequence our proofs are different ( and , we hope , shed extra light on the results ) .",
    "we choose to present the results or the claims at the beginning of each sub - section and then a sketch of a proof , alias  esquisse dune preuve \" , in each sub - section .",
    "we hope that this presentation clarifies the concepts or the tools involved and makes more transparent the relations between the various approaches .",
    "the proofs we present may not always contain all the details necessary for claiming that they fully belong to the rigorous mathematical world , but they have some , and they are certainly proofs in the common sense of theoretical physics ( and also maybe from some perspectives of mathematical physics ) .",
    "although the main purpose of the present manuscript is to describe what the continuous limit of open quantum random walks ( open qrw ) is , that is what open quantum brownian motions ( open qbm ) are , we start by recalling what discrete open qrw are , at least in order to fix the framework and the notations .",
    "open qrw are generalizations of the quantum parallelism on random walks explained above but with walkers carrying extra internal degrees of freedom and interacting with series of probes .",
    "the quantum dynamical map for open qrw was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "a slightly different version ( implementing a specific dilation of these maps ) was introduced in @xcite , in which some of the results presented in the following were announced .",
    "open quantum random walks on the line are defined on the total hilbert space @xmath118 with @xmath8 the finite dimensional internal space ( the  gyroscope \" hilbert space ) , @xmath5 the orbital hilbert space ( the  walker \" hilbert space ) , and @xmath119 ( the  probe \" hilbert space ) .",
