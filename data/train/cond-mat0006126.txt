    "there has been a lot of recent interest in physical properties of biopolymers , ranging from elasticity of biopolymer networks and its use in the prediction of mechanical properties of cells to direct visualisation of single chain properties .",
    "examples of important biological macromolecules whose physical properties have been recently studied are : actin , a double - stranded semiflexible protein polymer which forms an integral part of the cytoskeleton ( mechanical structure ) of eukaryotic ( e.g. fungi , plants , animals ) cells ; microtubules , multi - stranded rigid and dynamic protein polymers which form one of the main components of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells and play an important part in their organisation ; dna , which carries the genetic code of all living organisms  @xcite .    since many of the processes involved in cell function(e.g .",
    "dna replication in cell division ) require major structural changes of these biopolymers  @xcite , there is a need for more microscopic but still analytically tractable models of such polymers which go beyond the simple picture of such molecules as homogenous elastic rods  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we study such a microscopic model specifically looking for qualitative differences between the behaviour of such molecules and simple worm - like chains  @xcite . in addition , most analyses of the worm - like chain models of polymers have focused on ground state properties ( long chains ) or bulk quantities  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to look at the effect of fluctuations , spatial correlations _ and _ finite size on these systems .",
    "a double - stranded semi - flexible polymer chain is the basic structure of many biopolymers .",
    "examples are of double - stranded biopolymers are dna and proteins such as actin .",
    "the model most used in the study of biopolymers is that of the worm - like chain  @xcite in which the polymer flexibility ( structure ) is determined by a single length , the persistence length @xmath0 which measures the tangent  tangent correlations .",
    "for example , dna has a persistence length @xmath1 whilst for actin @xmath2 .",
    "these biopolymers are known to have a more complex ` twisted ' structure .",
    "the multi - stranded nature of these polymers is also not taken into account in a simple worm - like chain model .",
    "it is not clear if such a fine structure will have an effect on the global properties of these objects . a possible effect of such fine structure is what we attempt to study in this article .",
    "our model is , in a sense , microscopic because the interaction between the bend and twist degrees of freedom is a _",
    "result_. this is fundamentally different from previous approaches  @xcite which try to include the twist degrees of freedom by adding extra terms to the free energy .    in a previous letter  @xcite we studied a version of the rail - way track model of everaers - bundschuh - kremer ( ebk ) @xcite for a double - stranded semi - flexible polymer , embedded in a @xmath3-dimensional space for arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to present a detailed description of our theoretical and numerical calculations and in addition we present some new results on the effect of confinement on the statistical mechanics of the ribbon polymer @xcite .",
    "excluded volume and electrostatic interactions have been ignored throughout .",
    "we find that the system , has qualitatively different properties in the low temperature and high temperature regimes , in contrast to what one might naively expect from an inherently one - dimensional system with local interactions and constraints .",
    "the tangent  tangent correlation function decays exponentially in the whole range of temperatures with a `` tangent - persistence length '' @xmath4 that has a very slow temperature dependence , and whose scale is determined by the ( bare ) persistence length of a single strand @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the bending stiffness of a single strand ) .",
    "note that it is independent of @xmath7 , the separation of the two strands , which is the other relevant length scale in the problem .",
    "however , the correlation function of the bond - director field , defined as a vector that determines the separation and coupling of the two strands of the combined polymer system , has different behaviour below and above the temperature @xmath8 . while it decays purely exponentially for @xmath9 , there are additional oscillatory modulations for @xmath10 .",
    "the related `` bond - persistence length '' @xmath11 does not change appreciably at high temperatures , where its scale is again set by @xmath12 alone . in the low temperature phase , however , @xmath11 does show a temperature dependence .",
    "in particular , @xmath13 for @xmath14 , while @xmath15 for @xmath16 . similarly , the `` pitch '' @xmath17 , defined as the period of oscillations in the low temperature regime , changes drastically with temperature , ranging from @xmath18 near @xmath19 , to @xmath20 near @xmath21 . at @xmath19",
    "we restore a flat ribbon which has true long - range order in both the tangent and bond - director fields .",
    "the ribbon is essentially a rigid rod .",
    "as we approach @xmath19 , the persistence lengths and the pitch diverge with the scaling @xmath22 .",
    "the spontaneous appearance of a short range twist structure may be understood in the language of the _ homogenous _ rod models  @xcite as a _",
    "local _ twist - bend coupling , which is observed up to a screening length @xmath23 that lies between @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "we find that the anisotropy in the rigidity of a ribbon results in a `` kink - rod '' structure , in which the ribbon is _ at every point along its contour _ either twisted and unbent ( rod ) or bent and untwisted ( kink ) .",
    "this _ inhomogeneous _ behaviour is in sharp contrast with uniform worm - like chain behaviour , and can be interpreted as an _ infinitely _ strong twist - bend coupling .",
    "this structure is , however , screened on long length scales due to the fact that the ribbon is a one dimensional system with short range interactions .",
    "the short range twist order and the kink - rod structure will naturally disappear when @xmath24 corresponding to the temperature @xmath25 .",
    "we also observe a twist - stretch coupling .",
    "we also study the effects of confinement on the double - stranded polymer .",
    "we enforce the confinement to a box of size @xmath26 as an additional constraint . for @xmath27",
    ", we recover the behaviour of free double - stranded semiflexible polymers @xcite .",
    "in particular , the tangent - tangent correlation has a purely exponential decay with a characteristic length scale of order @xmath12 , while the bond - director field develops a crossover to a phase with oscillatory correlations . as @xmath26",
    "is decreased , there is a crossover to a phase with oscillatory tangent - tangent correlations about @xmath28 . for @xmath29",
    ", we find that both the persistence length in the perpendicular direction @xmath30 , and the characteristic oscillation length @xmath31 , scale as @xmath32 which is considerably less than @xmath12 .",

    "the system is composed of two semiflexible chains , each with rigidity @xmath6 , whose embeddings in @xmath3-dimensional space are defined by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as the sum of the hamiltonians of two wormlike chains @xmath35.\\label{h12}\\ ] ] we assume that the individual strands ( that make up the double - stranded polymer ) are inextensible : @xmath36 .",
    "the ribbon structure is then enforced by having @xmath37 separated from @xmath38 by a distance @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath39 , where @xmath40 can be non - zero but is small .",
    "we have defined a _ bond - director field _",
    "@xmath41 , which is a unit vector perpendicular to _ both _ strands ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the chains are assumed to have permanent bonds ( such as hydrogen bonds ) that are strong enough to keep the distance between the two strands constant . in ref.@xcite , it is argued that the relevant constraint on the system would then require that the arclength mismatch between the two strands in a bent configuration should be very small .",
    "we can calculate the arclength mismatch for the bent configuration as @xmath42 , where @xmath7 is the separation of the strands .",
    "we impose the constraint as a hard one , namely , we set @xmath43 as opposed to ref.@xcite .",
    "physically this means we _ do not _ allow bends in the plane of the ribbon .",
    "these bends are not important in @xmath44 because as we shall see the lower length scale will be set by the ` pitch ' which will make the in - plane fluctuations of the ribbon irrelevant  @xcite",
    ".    we can argue that the simplifying assumption does not change the behaviour of the system .",
    "if we impose a soft constraint as in ref.@xcite using an energy term like @xmath45 , we can see that the length @xmath46 determines two different regimes ; the interesting one being @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the length of the chains ) .",
    "hence , our hard constraint in fact only restricts us to the case of interest .",
    "we implement the constraint @xmath43 by introducing the `` mid - curve '' @xmath49 : @xmath50 in terms of the tangent to the mid - curve @xmath51 , which we call the _ tangent - director field _ , and the bond - director @xmath52 , the hamiltonian of the system can now be written as @xmath53,\\label{htn}\\ ] ] subject to the exact ( local ) constraints @xmath54 for a weakly bent ribbon , the hamiltonian in eq.([htn ] ) can be conveniently thought of as having two major contributions : a bending energy @xmath55 ( the first term ) , and a twisting energy @xmath56 ( the second term ) .",
    "it is well known that the statistical mechanics of semiflexible chains are difficult due to the constraint of inextensibility .",
    "various approximation methods have been devised to tackle the problem . a successful scheme , that somehow manages to capture the crucial features of the problem , is to impose global ( average ) constraints rather than local ( exact ) ones @xcite .",
    "this approximation is known to be good for calculating the average end - to - end length .",
    "it can be used for the probability distribution of the end - to - end length _ only _ if the persistence length is much less than the chain length so that the chain conformation can be considered isotropic",
    ". we can get good insight to the approximation scheme , by considering the fact that it corresponds to a saddle - point evaluation of the integrals over the lagrange multipliers , which are introduced to implement the constraints @xcite . in this sense",
    ", it is known to be a `` mean - field '' approximation in spirit .",
    "one can then go further by considering the effect of fluctuations on this mean - field result .",
    "the power of this approach is that one can easily calculate quantities which turn out to be very difficult if the constraints are required to hold exactly  @xcite .    to study the effect of fluctuations , we have performed a systematic @xmath57-expansion ( sketched in appendix [ a1/d])@xcite .",
    "we see that no divergent behaviour appears when we calculate the diagrams of the _ 2-point _ correlation functions .",
    "this means that the mean - field behaviour of these functions , at least , wo nt change due to fluctuations , although it does not preclude differences in higher order correlation functions .    with the above discussion as justification",
    ", we apply the same approximation scheme to our problem defined in sec .",
    "[ srail ] : the local constraints in eq.([constr ] ) are relaxed to global ones .",

    "this implies that a polymer made up of two inextensible strands is always `` slightly extensible '' at any finite temperature , due to the presence of twist fluctuations .",

    "the nature of competition in our double - stranded polymer system can be understood using a plaquette model .",
    "we can coarse - grain the ribbon to a length - scale ( @xmath111 ) where we can consider it to be made up of plaquettes which are joined up to form a ribbon ( see fig .",

    "if we choose @xmath115 in the coarse - graining process , we can safely assume that the ribbon is rod - like ( we freeze out the bending modes ) and that it only has twist fluctuations .",
    "we may then write @xmath116 where the ( fixed ) unit vectors @xmath117 span the plane perpendicular to the rod . rewriting eq.([htn ] ) in terms of @xmath118 and implementing the constraints , we obtain @xmath119,\\ ] ] subject to the constraint : @xmath120 .",
    "note that the lowest order contribution to the twist potential starts from a quartic term .",
    "we can now expand the nonlinear term in the above hamiltonian , and perform the coarse - graining , in the framework of a perturbation theory , by integrating out the modes between @xmath121 and @xmath122 in the momentum shell .",
    "we can then determine the form of the coarse - grained hamiltonian and calculate the renormalized coupling constants .",
    "we keep only terms up to second ( gaussian ) order , which is a good approximation for @xmath123 , and obtain @xmath124 where @xmath125 where @xmath126 are constants of order unity .",
    "in contrast to the bending energy , the effective twist energy is frustrated due to the opposite sign of @xmath127 and @xmath128  @xcite . in the spin analogy , this would correspond to a model with next nearest neighbour competing interactions similar to the so - called annni model , which develops oscillations for certain values of the ratio @xmath129 ( of order 1 )  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath130 , and we can thus account for the pitch @xmath93 .    the competition is present only at nonzero temperatures , and is merely due to topological constraints of the ribbon .",
    "another , more physical way of understanding this competition is to consider the interaction between two neighbouring twisted regions .",
    "it is easy to see that twists of opposite sign meeting at an edge tend to unwind ( annihilate ) each other  @xcite , while twists of the same sign are trapped when they meet ; they do not annihilate each other and add up ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : liketwists ] ) .",
    "an intriguing feature of the behaviour of this model is that , although the ground state ( @xmath19 ) configuration of the system is a flat ribbon , and supports no twists , upon raising the temperature , a twisted structure with short range _ twist _ order develops .",

    "one can see that @xmath11 is equal to the length scale @xmath31 at which the strands undergo conformational fluctuations of the order of their separation : @xmath174 .",
    "hence , segments of length @xmath11 are straight ( for @xmath101 ) .",
    "however , fluctuations of order @xmath7 are sufficient to wash out the memory of twist .",
    "the anti - correlation in fact comes from the frustration as explained above .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the number of twisted rods in each segment @xmath175 decreases very quickly , until it saturates to unity at @xmath21 . for higher temperatures the mechanism changes , and the bond correlations are cut off by the tangent fluctuations .",
    "hence , the short - range twist order does not survive anymore .",
    "all the main features of the above picture have also been observed in the simulation .    a kink - rod structure similar to the one discussed here has indeed been observed in experiments done on actin filaments @xcite .",
    "actin is a charged polymer , and the mutual electrostatic repulsion of its different segments plays a major role in its structural stiffness .",
    "it is well known , however , that the introduction of _ multivalent _ counterions ( ions of opposite charge that are necessary to neutralise the solution ) can reduce the electrostatic repulsion , and even lead to attraction between like charged polymers , or different like charged segments of a same polymer @xcite . in a recent experiment , tang",
    "et al @xcite used fluorescence microscopy techniques to image _ condensed _ ( or collapsed ) actin bundles that are formed due to the presence of multivalent counterions .",
    "snapshots of the bundles , showing their typical conformations , are shown in fig .",
    "[ actin ] .",
    "a remarkable feature in the observation was the presence of sharp corners which connect relatively straight segments of the actin bundles , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ actin ] .",
    "tang et al @xcite observed that this feature is present only when the bundle is made up of two or more filaments of actin , and is absent when there is only a single filament in the condensate .",
    "it is plausible to assume that the observed kink - rod structure can be accounted for by similar arguments to the one developed above .",
    "the only difference is the fact that the structure in the experimental case is a ring , as opposed to a chain with free ends .",
    "however , we do not expect this constraint to affect the argument , because the inherent competition between twist and bend degrees of freedom is local .",
    "of course , more experimental efforts are needed to rule out other possible scenarios for the formation of the kinks , such as defects in the packing of more than one filament , sequence disorder , or metastable effects due to the dynamics of the collapse .",
    "in this section , we study the effect of confinement on double - stranded semiflexible polymers .",
    "we confine the double - stranded polymer in a @xmath176-dimensional subspace to a box of size @xmath26 , while leaving it free in the remaining @xmath177 dimensions .    in terms of the tangent to the mid - curve @xmath51 , and the bond - director @xmath52 ,",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system can now be written as @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a dimensionless constant in addition to @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 defined in section [ sfree ] .",
    "the constants will be determined self - consistently by demanding that the relevant constraints hold on average : inextensibility of the individual strands , constant separation between the chains , the bond - director being normal to the strands , and confinement of the polymer to a box of size @xmath26 in @xmath176 dimensions ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "this final constraint is valid as long as the chain length is much larger than @xmath26 .",
    "we obtain the following set of equations for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath179 : @xmath181 although the above nonlinear set of equations are very difficult to solve , we can get the behaviour of the solutions by looking at the asymptotics in the limiting cases , as summarised in table [ asymp ] .",

    "the presence of the boundaries provides another competing mechanism to cut off tangent correlations in the directions of confinement .",
    "moreover , the oscillatory form of the correlation function with a period @xmath195 implies a sinusoidal packing of the polymer in the confining cavity , where again the size of the oriented segments ( the period of the oscillations ) is set by the walls cutting off the roughness of the polymer . as seen in sec.[skink ] , a semiflexible ribbon develops a kink - rod structure at finite temperatures ( due the strong anisotropy in rigidity ) , in which rod - like segments ( about a persistence length long ) are connected by rather sharp kinks with a core size of the order of the diameter of the ribbon .",
    "if such a structure is restricted to a size less than the bare persistence length , new kinks have to be created at the confining walls to squeeze the ribbon into the available space .",
    "this therefore leads to the compact zigzag conformation of kinks and rods and the subsequent oscillatory tangent correlations .",
    "it is straight forward to calculate the free energy of the system .",
    "we find , @xmath196.\\label{free1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is interesting to examine the limiting behaviour of the free energy as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "we obtain @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a smoothly varying numerical coefficient ranging from @xmath199 for @xmath200 , to @xmath201 for @xmath202 . the free energy , interestingly , interpolates between the steric repulsion of non self - avoiding flexible polymers confined to @xmath26 @xcite , which has @xmath203 behaviour , to helfrich undulation free energy of stiff polymers confined to @xmath26 @xcite , which has @xmath204 behaviour  @xcite .    using the above results , we now analyse some recent experiments by ott et al  @xcite who measure the persistence length of actin filaments confined between microscope slides .",

    "one therefore has a corrected persistence length @xmath211 .",
    "we therefore estimate for those experiments a correction of approximately @xmath212 , i.e. @xmath213 .",

    "there are a number of advantages evident in our approach .",
    "first , we introduce a microscopic model which remains true to the chemical structure of many biomolecules .",
    "second , our _ approximate _ method of solving this model also lends itself to the analysis of the fluctuations in the system and to study intermediate - scale behaviour as well as the ground state ( long length - scale ) properties .",
    "finally , this method could be easily extended to describe multi - stranded objects .",
    "we expect that the effect of an intrinsic twist changes the ground state but does not change any of the conclusions of our description , although we expect it to make the effective persistence length much higher .",
