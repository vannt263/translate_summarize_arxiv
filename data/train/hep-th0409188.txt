    "the question of black hole uniqueness in higher dimensions has been attracting considerable attention since the discovery by emparan and reall  @xcite of an asymptotically flat black ring in five dimensions .",
    "this is a solution with a regular event horizon of topology @xmath0 , supported against collapse by angular momentum .",
    "since there is a rotating black hole which carries the same mass and angular momentum as this solution , this represents a breakdown of the usual no - hair behaviour : the solution is not uniquely determined by the asymptotic conserved charges .",
    "studies of charged rings have uncovered further examples of non - uniqueness  @xcite .",
    "so far , all these examples involve discrete forms of non - uniqueness : the existence of some finite number of solutions with the same asymptotic charges .",
    "although the classical solutions in  @xcite involved a continuous parameter , this parameter can be physically interpreted in terms of a local charge carried by the ring , so it will be quantized in the fundamental theory .",
    "furthermore , bounds on this charge for the existence of a regular event horizon imply that these solutions give a finite number of solutions with given energy .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the fundamental quantum theory has a finite number of states of given energy in finite volume .",
    "we would expect that in general distinct classical solutions must correspond to different quantum states .",
    "a new example with an apparent continuous non - uniqueness was recently found in  @xcite .",
    "they constructed solutions describing rotating charged black holes in five - dimensional gauged supergravity , with the two angular momentum parameters set equal .",
    "studying first a case with a single @xmath1 gauge field  @xcite , they found solutions with four parameters : the mass , charge , angular momentum , and one additional parameter . in",
    "@xcite , they extended this to a @xmath2 theory with independent charges and found a solution depending on six parameters .",
    "the solutions thus appeared to involve a continuous non - uniqueness , which initially appeared to have physical consequences . in light of the previous discussion , we want to understand the physical significance of this extra parameter , to see how the apparent contradiction with our expectation that there should be a finite number of solutions of given energy is resolved .",
    "in addition , these solutions appear to provide a first example of non - uniqueness involving black holes with a spherical horizon topology , so it would clearly be interesting to understand them in more detail .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that the extra parameter in the solutions of  @xcite is unphysical , representing a purely coordinate degree of freedom . in  @xcite",
    ", it was observed that if the charge @xmath3 vanished , the additional parameter could be removed by a coordinate transformation and redefinition of the other parameters . in the next section ,",
    "we extend this to the case with @xmath4 .",
    "we discuss the extremal limits in terms of these parameters , showing how the solutions of  @xcite are recovered in our parametrization , and briefly discuss the reduction to other known solutions .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of discrete non - uniqueness , and show that although the relation between our parametrization of the solutions and the physical mass and charges is non - linear , there is only one black hole solution for given mass , angular momentum and charges .",
    "we present a similar argument for the @xmath2 solutions of  @xcite in section  [ 3ch ] .",
    "thus , these solutions do not in fact present new examples of non - uniqueness .",
    "as stressed in  @xcite , they do provide interesting testing grounds for the ads / cft correspondence , and generalise known solutions in interesting ways .",
    "( in particular , they provide non - extreme versions of the interesting supersymmetric asymptotically ads solution found in  @xcite . )",
    "we consider first the solution obtained in  @xcite , describing a charged rotating black hole with a cosmological constant . the solution can be written in the simplest form by introducing the left - invariant one - forms @xmath5 on @xmath6 , @xmath7",
    "the solution then takes the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 , \\\\ f&=&-\\frac{j}{2b^2}\\big(\\lambda\\beta r^2+\\frac{2m+q}{r^2}-\\frac{q^2}{r^4}\\big),\\\\ w&=&1-\\lambda r^2-\\frac{1}{r^2}\\left[2\\lambda j^2(m+q)+2(1-\\lambda\\beta j^2)^2(m+q)-2q(1-\\lambda\\beta j^2)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{r^4}\\left\\{(1-\\lambda\\beta j^2)^2q^2+j^2[\\lambda q^2 + 2(m+q)]\\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "this is a solution of minimal gauged five - dimensional supergravity .",
    "it appears to depend on four parameters , @xmath10 .",
    "the first three can be related to the mass , angular momentum and charge , but the physical interpretation of the fourth is obscure : we will show that this solution can in fact be written in terms of only three parameters .",
    "the first step is to transform to a frame in which the metric is non - rotating at infinity , so that it approaches the usual diagonal form of the ads metric at large distances , by making the shift @xmath11 we then have @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13.\\ ] ] it is convenient to exchange @xmath14 for a new parameter @xmath15 ( as in  @xcite ) @xmath16 we then see that the gauge field becomes @xmath17 so the physical gauge charge is related to @xmath18 .",
    "we also see that @xmath19 involves the parameters only in the combinations @xmath20 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 .",
    "this suggests that we define the following new parameters : @xmath22 we then find that the solution depends only on the three parameters @xmath23 , and has no remaining dependence on @xmath15 : @xmath24 where @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is perhaps worth noting that this expression for @xmath26 can be rewritten as @xmath27 thus , we see that the solution actually only depends on three parameters , corresponding to the three conserved quantities @xmath28 .",
    "the relation of two of the parameters to these conserved quantities is fairly direct : from the form of the gauge potential , we see that @xmath29 the angular momentum @xmath30 can be calculated using the komar integral technique and is given by @xmath31 so @xmath32 is analogous to the angular momentum per unit mass parameter @xmath33 in the usual kerr solution .",
    "the remaining parameter @xmath34 is related to the freedom to specify the mass , but in a less simple way .",
    "we can define a thermodynamic mass as in  @xcite by insisting that it satisfy the first law of thermodynamics for charged rotating black holes , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the co - rotating electric potential evaluated on the horizon .",
    "this gives the mass @xmath37 note that although this looks like a linear relation , if we solve ( [ angmom ] ) for @xmath32 in terms of @xmath30 , ( [ mass ] ) will become a cubic equation for @xmath34 in terms of @xmath38 .",
    "the reduction of this solution to previously known metrics was discussed at length in  @xcite .",
    "we will briefly revisit this issue to illuminate our parametrization of the solution .",
    "considering first the known bps solutions , we note that the form above reduces to the solution in  @xcite if we set @xmath39 ( after a redefinition of the radial coordinate , @xmath40 ) , so this choice of parameters is well - adapted to this limit , while recovering the solution of  @xcite requires a more complicated choice : to recover their solution , we write @xmath41 and set @xmath42 from the results of  @xcite , we see that for this choice of parameters , the solution has a degenerate horizon ( a double root of @xmath43 ) at @xmath44 .",
    "the condition that @xmath43 have a double root at @xmath44 in general implies @xmath45 and @xmath46 since these are two conditions on the three parameters @xmath47 , there is a family of solutions with degenerate horizons with one extra parameter , generalising the solution found in  @xcite .",
    "however , from the analysis in  @xcite , we expect that only the solution found there is bps .",
    "the other simple special cases are when @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 , if we set @xmath51 , the solution reduces to the rnads black hole studied in  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath52 , if we set @xmath53 the solution reduces to a special case of the five - dimensional kerr - ads metric obtained in  @xcite , where the two angular momentum parameters are equal , @xmath54 . relating the form of the metric used in  @xcite to ( [ metric ] ) requires a shift of the angular coordinate to make the metric in  @xcite asymptotically diagonal and a redefinition of the radial coordinate , @xmath55 . when @xmath49 , the solution is related to a special case of the general solution obtained in  @xcite where the two angular momentum parameters are equal , @xmath56 , and the three charge parameters are equal , @xmath57",
    "the relation between the parameters is @xmath58 relating the metric in  @xcite to ( [ metric ] ) again requires a redefinition of the radial coordinate , @xmath59 .    as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the physically interesting solutions are those with a regular event horizon and no closed timelike curves outside the horizon .",
    "that is , we want to consider parameter values for which there is some @xmath60 such that @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( so that @xmath60 is the outer event horizon ) and @xmath63 .",
    "written explicitly in terms of our parameters , these conditions are @xmath64 where we have introduced the notation @xmath65 , @xmath66 \\geq 0 , \\ ] ] and @xmath67 these conditions will impose some constraints on the values of @xmath68 .",
    "for example , the requirement that ( [ rplus ] ) have a real positive root for @xmath69 implies that @xmath70 unfortunately , although our coordinate transformation and redefinition of parameters simplifies the functions somewhat , it is still difficult to analyse the full set of constraints .    an alternative approach is to use the above relations to replace the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath34 in the metric by @xmath60 and @xmath71 , thereby automatically incorporating the constraint @xmath63 for the absence of naked closed timelike curves .",
    "we can easily determine the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and substituting this into ( [ rplus ] ) then gives a quadratic equation to solve for @xmath34 , determining it in terms of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting form of the metric is , unfortunately , rather messy and unenlightening , and it would still be necessary to somehow incorporate the constraint that @xmath62 , which will restrict the possible values of @xmath60 and @xmath72 for given @xmath75 .",
    "so far we have discussed continuous non - uniqueness .",
    "we should also consider the possibility of discrete non - uniqueness . as noted previously , ( [ mass ] ) gives a cubic equation for @xmath34 as a function of the physical parameters @xmath76 ,",
    "so it is possible that we will have more than one black hole solution for a given mass and charge . if we define the dimensionless quantities @xmath77 then ( [ angmom ] )",
    "tells us @xmath78 and substituting this into ( [ mass ] ) gives @xmath79 this is a cubic equation in @xmath80 so for each @xmath81 there are possibly three different solutions .",
    "however , for a solution to correspond to a black hole , @xmath61 must have at least one positive real root , at which @xmath63 .",
    "we performed a numerical analysis to check whether there are values of @xmath81 for which more than one of the roots of  ( [ gam ] ) satisfy these conditions .",
    "we found that at most one root of  ( [ gam ] ) has a black hole interpretation , thus ruling out any discrete non - uniqueness .",
    "a representative plot is shown in figure 1 .",
    "in a further paper  @xcite , the previous solution was generalised to a class of non - extremal charged rotating black hole solutions in the five dimensional @xmath2 gauged theory of @xmath82 supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets .",
    "this theory now has three gauge fields @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and two scalars @xmath85 .",
    "the solutions they obtain can be written as @xmath86 , \\\\",
    "e^{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6 } }    \\varphi_1 }   & = & x_3 , \\quad e^{\\sqrt{2 } \\varphi_2 } = \\frac{x_2}{x_1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 are shorthand for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , \\nonumber\\\\ f_2&=&\\gamma l\\lambda r^3+\\mu l(\\prod_{i}c_{i}-\\prod_{i}s_{i})r^2+\\mu^2 l\\prod_i s_i , \\\\ f_3&=&\\gamma^2 l^2\\lambda^2 r^3+\\mu l^2\\lambda\\left[2\\gamma(\\prod_{i}c_{i}-\\prod_{i}s_{i})-1-\\gamma^2 l^2\\lambda\\right]r^2   + \\mu l^2 \\\\ & & -\\lambda(1+\\gamma^2 l^2\\lambda)\\mu^2 l^2\\left[2(\\prod_{i}c_{i}-\\prod_{i}s_{i})\\prod_{j}s_{j}-\\sum_{i < j}s_i s_j\\right]+2\\lambda\\gamma\\mu^2 l^2\\prod_i s_i , \\nonumber \\\\ y&=&f_3-\\lambda(1+\\gamma^2 l^2\\lambda)r^3+r^4-\\mu r^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this solution seems to depend on six non - trivial parameters @xmath93 .",
    "our aim is to show that this depends on only five independent parameters .",
    "again we begin by moving to coordinates in which the metric is asymptotically diagonal by setting @xmath94 we then have @xmath95\\mathrm{d}t+\\frac{1}{2}l(c_i s_j s_k - s_i c_j c_k)\\tilde\\sigma_{3}\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96    r^2 + \\mu^2 l\\prod_i s_i \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\gamma l \\lambda \\mu^2 l^2    \\left[2(\\prod_{i}c_{i}-\\prod_{i}s_{i})\\prod_{j}s_{j}-\\sum_{i",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the radial coordinate used here is different from that used in the previous case : the singularity in this metric will occur at @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the smallest of the charge parameters , and not at @xmath99 as before .",
    "we are therefore motivated to make a change of radial coordinate to a new radial coordinate @xmath100 , @xmath101 with this new choice of radial coordinate , @xmath102 where @xmath103 so the scalar fields , which are determined by the @xmath104 , depend on the parameters only through the combinations @xmath105 .    as in the previous case",
    ", we will find suitable parameters by examining the gauge fields and the function @xmath106 appearing in the asymptotic form of the metric .",
    "we are thereby led to define the five independent parameters @xmath107,\\\\   r_i&=&\\sqrt{\\mu } ( c_{i}s_{j}s_{k}-s_{i}c_{j}c_{k}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this may seem an awkward definition , but the @xmath108 in particular have several nice properties : @xmath109 so the combinations @xmath105 appearing in the @xmath110 , and hence in the scalar fields , can be written as @xmath111 . also , @xmath112 = r_j r_k - \\gamma r_i,\\ ] ] so the gauge fields can be written as @xmath113 finally , the metric in the new coordinates is @xmath114 and after a certain amount of calculation , it is possible to rewrite @xmath115 and @xmath116 as @xmath117.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the solution therefore depends only on five independent parameters , and a metric will be uniquely fixed by specifying the mass , angular momentum and three gauge charges .",
    "that is , this case is qualitatively the same as in the previous section .",
    "a useful consistency check is that when the three charges are equal , this reduces to the previous metric on setting @xmath118 we have not considered the relation of these parameters to the physical mass , angular momentum and charges , so there is still the possibility of some discrete non - uniqueness in this case , but we doubt this possibility is realised in practice .",
