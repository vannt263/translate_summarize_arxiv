    "as of early 2011 the _ kepler mission _ is roughly half way through its baseline 3.5 year mission , with about one - third of the baseline data having now received some analysis .",
    "the pace of discoveries and results from the _ kepler mission _ are accelerating and already quite extensive , even though the prime goal of detecting true earth - analog exoplanets remains in the future , simply from needing to have more extensive time coverage in order to detect transits spaced by a full year . in the area of exoplanets , over 1200 candidates",
    "have been detected and reported in @xcite , with validation of exoplanets first following from transit timing variations discussed by @xcite , the smallest rocky planet to date in @xcite , and a six - planet system unveiled in @xcite .",
    "discoveries from _",
    "kepler s _ second area of emphasis are equally impressive ranging from detection of oscillations on solar - type stars for hundreds of cases in @xcite ( only tens had been known before the _ kepler mission _ ) to detailed inferences on individual stars ( @xcite ) , and a recent breakthrough involving the detection of both the expected p - modes as well as g - modes allowing sensitive new studies of red giant stars ( @xcite ) . in stellar astrophysics _",
    "kepler _ has revealed a remarkable eccentric a - star binary viewed nearly face on with reflected light features superimposed on tidally - forced g - mode oscillations @xcite , and two instances of mutually eclipsing hierarchical triple systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "returning to a discussion of the prime goal of detecting true earth - analogs , the observational quest is truly daunting .",
    "an earth - analog presents a transit signature with a depth of 85 parts per million ( ppm ) , lasting a statistical average of 10 hours , and occurring once per year .",
    "the signal would only be evident after seeing three successive transits equally spaced in time .",
    "since the geometric probability of having transits in earth - analog systems is only 0.5% , it is necessary to monitor a very large number of stars nearly continuously over multiple years at very high precision to have any chance of success .",
    "the _ kepler mission _ was scoped @xcite to be able to determine the frequency of earth - size planets at sufficiently long orbital periods to reach well into the habitable zone @xcite .",
    "this is challenging on a number of levels , including perhaps the simplest one of the noise levels needed to support detection .",
    "notable in the @xcite paper is a significant fall - off in planet frequency for the smallest planet candidates , especially at the long orbital periods associated with habitability ( possible presence of liquid water on the surface based on equilibrium temperatures ) .",
    "some of this fall - off is expected to date , since insufficient time has passed to be able to detect true earth analogs . however , the relative sparsity of earth - sized planets at shorter orbital periods is open to interpretation and will surely be the focus of much discussion in the exoplanet community .",
    "do the statistical trends primarily follow from the physics of planet formation ( @xcite ) , or is there a strong contribution from observational incompleteness given the larger than anticipated noise levels ( @xcite ) ?",
    "this question is beyond the scope of this paper to resolve .",
    "we will endeavor to more fully explore the noise levels obtained in the _ kepler mission _ given that these are not as low as expected .",
    "the approach in the remainder of the paper is as follows . a self - contained introduction to the mission and data characteristics",
    "will be given in  2 .",
    "based on consideration of the _ kepler _ data set itself , and knowledge of instrument characteristics such as detector readout noise , a subset of @xmath012th magnitude stars will be used to establish a decomposition of noise into temporal , instrument , and intrinsic stellar terms in  3 .  4 will provide simulations of intrinsic stellar noise as a means of assessing the reasonableness of the noise separation , and for motivating what may be learned about stellar astrophysics from the _ kepler _ results .",
    "a fainter sample of stars will be reported on in  5 .",
    "prospects for confirmation of the stellar noise differences found will be touched upon in  6 with a summary in  7 .",
    "characteristics of the _ kepler mission _ have been presented in detail in @xcite with details on the pipeline processing given in @xcite .",
    "the overall instrument performance is discussed by @xcite , with target selection covered by @xcite , operations by @xcite and initial data characteristics given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide a general survey of stellar variability based on the first full month of _ kepler _ data . here",
    "we discuss some of the characteristics that are most pertinent to understanding the overall noise levels , both those arising from fundamental limitations like poisson statistics on the sources , and simple instrument limitations such as ccd readout noise .",
    "we consider only the long cadence ( lc ) data , which consist of summations of 270 individual readouts each a little over 6 seconds long into 29.4 minute intervals .",
    "in addition we limit our attention to those intermediate time scales that are most relevant for the detection of transits . at the high precision levels provided by _ kepler _ it has been found that all red giants are obvious photometric variables @xcite ; we will endeavor to ignore these and other classes of variable stars by restricting our attention to roughly solar - type stars .",
    "the _ kepler _ field of view was carefully selected to fall relatively near , but not on , the galactic plane .",
    "this provides a high stellar density of dwarf stars , while avoiding too high a density of fainter background stars , which could lead to false positives through diluted eclipses of background binaries .",
    "the primary range of stellar brightness followed by _",
    "kepler _ is _ kp _",
    "= 9 to 15 @xcite , where _ kp _ represents a broad bandpass from about 420 to 900 nm roughly a combination of @xmath1 plus @xmath2 bandpasses .",
    "saturation occurs at about _",
    "_ = 11.5 , but conservation of charge is preserved beyond saturation and excellent photometry is easily recovered from targets up to 7 magnitudes beyond saturation by summing over the pixels bled into  along columns @xcite . for special applications on highly variable stars , observations to at least 20th magnitude may be useful . the point design for _ kepler _ is based on results at 12th magnitude , and we will concentrate on stars with _ kp _",
    "= 11.5 to 12.5 for which fundamental noise terms , instrument contributions , and intrinsic stellar noise may be comparable in scale , thus facilitating unique determination of the separate levels .",
    "the primary noise metric for _ kepler _ is referred to as cdpp , combined differential photometric precision , which is intended to be either the observed noise in a carefully specified temporal domain , or the predicted noise level in the same temporal domain from rolling up all contributing factors including intrinsic stellar variability ",
    "see @xcite for discussion of early on - orbit results . by design cdpp near 6.5 hours ( one - half the time for a central transit of a true earth - analog ) was intended to be about 20 ppm for the mode of dwarf stars at 12th magnitude , in order to provide slightly more than 4-@xmath3 signal - to - noise ratio for single transits with 85 ppm depth . with four such transits the overall detection statistic @xcite",
    "would then reach a level providing less than one statistical false positive over the whole ensemble of such stars searched for transits .",
    "in reality @xcite the cdpp assessed as the mode over 12th magnitude dwarf stars is about 30 ppm , or 50% higher than planned for . based upon considerations of solar variability in the relevant temporal domain @xcite , stars were allocated 10 ppm in the noise budget to be rolled up into the cdpp . with a poisson term due to counting some 4.5 @xmath4 e- per 6.5 hours at 12th magnitude equal to about 15 ppm",
    ", the stellar noise was expected to be a significant contributor to the total noise , but not usually a limiting factor . a tail to higher intrinsic stellar noise",
    "was anticipated from more active , typically younger stars .",
    "having determined the observed cdpp for a star , or ensemble of such stars , how would one determine what part of this is intrinsic to the star ?",
    "answering this question will take up most of  3 .",
    "we continue here with an introduction to the observations and data characteristics that will need to be accounted for and analyzed fully to address this .    the _ kepler _ data are collected in segments one - quarter of the 372-day spacecraft - year long .",
    "_ kepler _ is in an earth - trailing orbit which provides unobscured access to a field well off the ecliptic throughout the year . in order to keep the solar arrays illuminated ,",
    "successive 90 degree rolls are executed every one - quarter year .",
    "the focal plane consists of 42 ccds with 27 @xmath5 pixels ( with very deep wells of about 1.1 @xmath6 e- ) and 1024@xmath72200 rows and columns .",
    "each ccd has two readout amplifiers leading to a total of 84 channels .",
    "the ccds are mounted pair - wise into 21 modules which cover a 5@xmath75 grid except for the corners which have smaller pixel scale ccds used only for precisely guiding the spacecraft .",
    "the ccds are oriented such that rotational symmetry is maintained except for the central - most module .",
    "although stars fall on a unique detector during each observing quarter , they maintain the same symmetry with respect to rows , columns and stellar neighbors after each roll ( except for the central module where the stars always remain , and symmetry is broken ) .",
    "[ fig : gm.obs ] is used for several orientation purposes to the _ kepler _ observing procedure and basic characteristics of the instrument .",
    "the layout of ccds illustrates the rotational symmetry across observing quarters . of greater relevance for this paper",
    "is to note the four channels in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm.obs ] flagged as comprising one ` quartet ' . for this example",
    "a star on channel 1 in quarter 2 ( july  september 2009 ) would be moved to channel 53 for quarter 3 ( october  december 2009 ) , then channel 81 for quarter 4 ( january  march 2010 ) , then channel 29 for quarter 5 ( april  june 2010 ) , before starting the cycle over on channel 1 for quarter 6 ( july ",
    "september 2010 ) . the stars that started in quarter 2 on any one of channels 1 , 29",
    ", 53 and 81 will simply permute through these same channels and thus form a natural ` quartet ' .",
    "there are 21 such quartets , and analysis of the stars within quartets will play a key roll in the noise decomposition discussed in the next section .    also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm.obs ] are numerical values by channel for readout noise in electrons for each amplifier and a metric of the focus as the fraction of energy contained in the central pixel for a star centered on a pixel .",
    "readout noise levels range from 77 to 149 e- and are taken from @xcite .",
    "the central pixel energy fractions were derived by the 1st author from images taken during commissioning , after the primary mirror had been adjusted in tilt and piston to attain best focus . a check with q5 data one year later showed nearly identical focus values .",
    "the 27 @xmath5 ccd pixels span a scale of 398 on the sky , very large compared to the diffraction limit of the 0.95-m schmidt telescope .",
    "initial plans had called for the telescope point spread function ( psf ) to be soft , specifying a maximum flux of some 30% in the central pixel of a best focused star centered on a pixel .",
    "mid - way through mission development this was reconsidered .",
    "sharper psfs would help both in terms of avoiding large numbers of false positives through background eclipsing binaries and optimally supporting through - transit centroiding to eliminate most background eclipsing binaries as false positives that blend with the targets .",
    "the resulting _ kepler _ psfs are very sharp  several of the modules have central energy concentrations for a central pixel in excess of 50% , with the sharpest focus channels reaching above 60% .",
    "the channels with the worst focus still come in near 30% central pixel energy fraction , with a mean over the full array being at 47% . by contrast _",
    "hst _ imaging instruments such as acs or wfc3 have typical central energy fractions more like 20%  for a mission intended to have high resolution as a primary attribute .",
    "simulations and now experience have both indicated that the best photometry is obtained from the _ kepler _ channels having the better focus . while the _ kepler _ psfs are severely undersampled ( in many cases with the underlying fwhm of the optical psf being only one - quarter of a pixel ) , the spacecraft guiding at the pixel scale is exquisite , much better than the already impressive case of _",
    "hst_. on the timescales most relevant for transits and cdpp",
    "the spacecraft jitter is about 6@xmath8 pixels .",
    "the point - to - point jitter of the _ kepler _ observations is @xmath9 pixels . for _ hst",
    "_ , point - to - point jitter on comparable timescales is @xmath00.1 pixels @xcite on the much finer 005 pixel scale of acs . in an absolute sense",
    "the _ kepler _ jitter bests _ hst _ by a full order of magnitude .",
    "translated to pixel scale , the _ kepler _ advantage is three orders of magnitude . on longer timescales of months",
    "differential velocity aberration can move images by over half a pixel in extreme cases over one quarter .",
    "the _ kepler _ psfs average about 4 pixels in diameter for 95% encircled energy , thus allowing apertures used for photometric extractions to remain small .    at 12th magnitude",
    "the average stellar image will consist of 12 - 13 pixels forming the ` optimal aperture ' .",
    "a ` postage stamp ' of pixels including this optimal aperture used for the photometric extraction plus a buffer halo of 1  2 pixels radius is returned for each target .",
    "this optimal aperture is held fixed within each quarter and is selected to maximize the signal - to - noise of each star for simple aperture sum photometry which is the only method used in the pipeline @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ ccds have large readout noise levels by ordinary standards , at about 100 e- .",
    "furthermore , each long cadence observation consists of 270 individual integrations .",
    "therefore the total variance from readout noise on a 12th magnitude star in the 6.5 hour intervals for which cdpp is defined sums to about 4.5 @xmath10 e-@xmath11 , but this is only one - tenth the variance ( direct counts ) from poisson statistics on the target itself .",
    "the number of pixels used for the optimal aperture of a star each quarter is a complex function of the psf , and whether a target has nearby neighbors , see @xcite .    at the middle of the 3.5 year baseline mission",
    "the overall spacecraft status is healthy",
    ". the only significant degradation to date was the loss of the two ccds on module 3 about nine months into the mission , about one month into quarter 4 .",
    "the associated electronics failure is not expected to affect other modules .",
    "we adopt a noise metric that is very similar to the formal , wavelet - based cdpp evaluated in the _ kepler _ science operations center pipeline @xcite , but easier to compute and explain .",
    "our noise metric starts with the pipeline calibrated , or pdc ( presearch data conditioned ) light curves archived for the project at the multimission archive ( mast ) at stsci .",
    "these data are then subjected to a high - pass savitsky - golay filtering by fitting a quadratic polynomial 2 days ( 97 lc points ) wide centered on each point in the time series , then subtracting this .",
    "sigma - clipping is introduced at 5-@xmath3 to eliminate highly deviant points .",
    "then the data are block - averaged into 6.5-hour segments by forming successive averages over 13 consecutive lc intervals . only segments containing at least 7 valid intervals",
    "are retained .",
    "the cdpp is simply obtained as the standard deviation of the 6.5-hour means .",
    "the savitsky - golay filter suppresses ( based on direct tests with trial time series ) 16.8% of the expected rms from white gaussian noise for 6.5-hour bins , this is corrected for by multiplying the resulting cdpp by @xmath71.168 to adjust for how much white noise would be suppressed by this band pass filtering .",
    "we thus end up with a strongly bandpass - limited metric , having first removed any slow variations captured by a 2-day wide least squares quadratic fit , then averaging out all time scales shorter than 6.5 hours .",
    "the scale of this cdpp is nearly identical to the 12-hour cdpp provided by the soc pipeline , and about 15% smaller than the 6-hour cdpp from soc .",
    "agreement between the two estimates is quite good with a 1-@xmath3 scatter of 10% .",
    "such a cdpp measure is formed for each star of interest separately for each of quarters 2 through 6 .",
    "q1 was omitted because it was less than half a quarter , and q0 was an even shorter commissioning period using a non - standard target set .",
    "module 3 was lost about three weeks into the start of q4 ; these truncated time series are also omitted .    for our purposes of determining what components of noise should be ascribed to the stars themselves , or other factors ,",
    "we restrict attention to stars that are not known _ a priori _ to be variable . at the precisions reached by _",
    "kepler _ all red giants are variable ( @xcite ) .",
    "many stars hotter than 6500 k fall into the classical instability strip and will be variable .",
    "some stars are known to have variability in their light curves from being eclipsing binaries , or kepler objects of interest hosting planet candidates .",
    "we start with the roughly 165,000 full list of kepler stars and adopt the kepler input catalog ( kic ) @xcite parameters .",
    "the approximately 15% of stars in the kic that are not  classified \" , i.e. do not have t@xmath12 , gravities , etc . , are dropped from consideration .",
    "we evaluate the predicted @xmath13 value ( location in a power spectrum of largest p - mode amplitudes which in the sun is at 3150 @xmath5hz ) of solar - type stellar oscillations and keep only the set between 1000 ",
    "6000 @xmath5hz , thus quite effectively eliminating both giants and subgiants from the sample ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath13 is proportional to gravity modified by @xmath14 ; our sample has been chosen to have log g @xmath0 4.0  4.7 .",
    "we also require that the t@xmath12 be between 5200 - 6500 k , and that mass be less than 1.4 @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting list is then cross - correlated with the known ebs and kois and all of these are dropped .",
    "stars are further restricted to have a maximum contamination over the multiple quarters of less than 20% , i.e. at least 80% of the light in optimal apertures is thought to come from the target star rather than light from nearby neighbors . with all of these eliminations in place",
    "a list of 69,005 stars remains .    at _",
    "kp _ = 11.5 to 12.5 used for primary results in this paper , very few stars have large contamination levels .",
    "only 1% of 12th magnitude stars are above the 20% cut , and only 1% of the retained sample exceed a 10% contamination .",

    "[ fig : gm.cdppo ] . a primary feature of the @xcite figure ( a horizontal swath of stars variable at a few hundred ppm ) is not included in our fig .  [ fig : gm.cdppo ] as a result of excluding giants and subgiants .",
    "the cdpp , formed for each star as the mean over quarters 2  6 after excluding the maximum value , is shown in fig .",
    "5 as distributions over galactic latitude and the fractional distribution with noise level .",
    "cdpp shows a broad distribution with a mode of 25 ppm , with overall median ( from set to cdpp @xmath16100 ppm ) of 27.9 ppm .",
    "the overall mean evaluated over a range to 3@xmath7 the median is 32.0 @xmath17 0.3 ( s.e . )",
    "the _ kp _ = 11.5 to 12.5 magnitude range will be used for primary analyses here .",
    "our goal is to achieve separation of the several terms most important for determining the observed noise ( cdpp ) level of stars . within the 12th magnitude band we have about 2500 dwarf stars in our sample ,",
    "most of which were observed five times ( a small subset was lost in quarter 4 and after from the loss of module 3 , and a minor geometric distortion of the focal plane leads to stars falling on or off silicon at the @xmath161% level quarter - to - quarter ) , there are thus some 12,500 observables .",
    "we wish to solve for five parameters corresponding to any unique extra noise quarter - to - quarter , 84 parameters corresponding to extra noise that may be associated with individual channels , and the 2,500 intrinsic stellar noise values .",
    "such a decomposition can be easily set up as a general least squares problem with the normal equations having some 2,589 unknowns and 12,500 observables . while formally over - determined , the problem possesses multiple degeneracies .",
    "this forces us to use some finesse in obtaining a decomposition .",
    "we work primarily in variance space where we assume that the different noise terms are uncorrelated and can therefore simply be added . for quoting results we will often use noise estimated as the square root of variance .",
    "the first step in all decompositions is to express the observables as variances , simply by squaring the cdpps available in ppm .",
    "the next step is to remove deterministically set terms for poisson noise from the target and sky , and detector readout noise .",
    "this combined noise term for the target is set as the inverse of the projected signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the signal term uses the median value in e- for the pdc ( in archival time series these are the ` ap_corr_flux ' vectors ) light curve ( which has had an offset ascribed to neighbors removed in the pipeline ) . in the sum of variances for noise",
    "the median value of the  raw \" lightcurve ( ` ap_raw_flux ' vector ) is used since the excess flux in the optimal aperture due to neighboring stars will at the least contribute extra poisson noise . as an equation",
    "the combination of poisson noise from target and sky , plus detector readout noise is :    @xmath18    where all terms are sums over appropriate numbers of exposures and pixels .",
    "the term for detector readout variance is the product of number of reads in 6.5 hours ( 13 @xmath7 270 = 3,510 ) multiplied by the number of pixels in the optimal aperture for the star in a given quarter , and then multiplied by the square of the readout noise as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm.obs ] .",
    "the resulting readout variance is about a factor of 10 smaller than the poisson variance for a 12th magnitude star .",
    "the contribution from poisson noise on the accumulated sky background is another factor of several smaller .",
    "the variances passed forward for further analysis are now the observed variances ( i.e. , cdpp squared ) from which the poisson and readout noise have been subtracted .",
    "each quarter ( @xmath090 days ) of _ kepler _ observations will be unique .",
    "some quarters , such as number 2 , suffered from a larger number of spacecraft safing events than usual , and during this quarter variable guide stars were still leading to minor variations of the guiding having print - through effects on the photometry for some stars . finally , until mid - way through quarter 3 a spacecraft heater was operated in a way that introduced minor guiding errors on a time scale influencing cdpp ; this was compounded by larger than average focus changes occurring during q3 .",
    "these and other issues with the data are detailed in the ` data release notes ' , e.g. @xcite for quarter 2 that may be found at the mast _ kepler _ archive .    seeking quarter - to - quarter mean offsets we start by evaluating our sample of about 2,500 12th magnitude stars to determine what their mean variance was in each quarter .",
    "we have also set up the full set of normal equations and directly solved for the quarter - to - quarter variance offsets using singular value decomposition codes @xcite .",
    "the two approaches gave nearly identical results .",
    "table 1 records the by - quarter variance excesses , and equivalent excess noise relative to the quietest quarter ( q5 ) , which has been set to zero .",
    "the resulting variations are consistent with expectations given improved management of the spacecraft from q2 to q3 and beyond .",
    "we have already accounted for ordinary ccd readout noise and always subtract this term as deterministic before searching for more subtle contributions . while the _ kepler _ ccds are excellent for their intended purpose , a few of them suffer from excess noise due to a number of limitations with the electronics .",
    "the data release notes discuss these @xcite . for our purposes",
    "we simply wish to solve for the excess noise that may exist channel - to - channel without making reference to the detailed reasons for such .",
    "our solutions are developed on a quartet - by - quartet basis , e.g. the set of channels 1 , 29 , 53 , and 81 which comprise one of twenty - one quartets . over the five quarters",
    "the same sets of stars are seen by each of these channels in turn .",
    "a degeneracy exists between the global offsets between all four such channels and a global offset for the approximately 120 stars per quartet observed each quarter at 12th magnitude .",
    "we can solve for these channel - to - channel offsets and do so using first svd , followed by a direct solution of the normal equations for which the least noisy channel has been fixed to zero excess noise to remove the degeneracy . doing this over all 21 quartets",
    "then results in _ relative _ offsets for the channels within the quartets , and we additionally track the median value ( within range of 0 to 70 ppm ) of the stars for each quartet .",
    "table 2 provides first a mapping of channels contained in each of the 21 quartets , then the channel to channel offsets found from the above prescription as well as the resulting median for the stars in this quartet .",
    "we will return to further discussion of this nature , but note that channels showing unusually high excess variance correlate at least qualitatively with channels already suspected of poorer than average performance .",
    "for example , channel number 58 ( in third channel of quartet 14 ) is known from ground - testing to have the worst overall performance in terms of image artifacts arising from limitations in the electronics boards , and the excess variance for this channel is clearly on the high side of values in table 2 . in a similar way",
    "the channels with the poorest overall focus , starting with the worst are : 56 , 55 , 3 , 53 , 54 , and 4 with variances of 250 , 227 , 247 , 192 , 210 , and 216 ppm@xmath11 respectively , thus corresponding to several of the overall largest terms .",
    "we develop intrinsic noise levels for the sun using 12 yr of measurements with the virgo / spm instrument in the green wavelength channel onboard the esa / nasa soho spacecraft ( frhlich et al .",
    "we divided the 1996  2008 spm lightcurve , which spans a full solar cycle , into thirty uninterrupted bins 91.7 days long with intrinsic cadence of 60 seconds , then binned these into 29.4 minute sums ( by averaging 30 consecutive points with weights of 0.7 for the end points ) .",
    "these sets of data were then treated in an identical manner using the same codes to arrive at cdpp estimates . in the case of these soho data instrument contributions to the variance are negligible and these estimates provide a good measure of the intrinsic variability of the sun on the time scales of interest for this study .",
    "the virgo / spm green channel is at a wavelength of 500 nm , 5 nm wide .",
    "we thus need to correct for the differing wavelengths of the soho and _ kepler _ observations assuming the canonical linear scaling of amplitude with wavelength @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ bandpass is very broad covering 423  897 nm at the 5% points @xcite .",
    "integrated over the spectral energy distribution for a solar - type star the mean wavelength for _ kepler _ observations is 634 nm @xcite .",
    "we therefore scale the derived cdpp values from the virgo observations down by 500/634 to approximate the variability for the _ kepler _ bandpass .",
    "this provides a mean and rms of 11.0 @xmath17 1.5 ppm , with the full range of variations encountered over the solar cycle spanning 7.8 to 14.7 ppm ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : solarex ] .",
    "these values will be used for comparison with the distribution of stellar noise as observed for ensembles of stars with _",
    "the variance normalizations appearing in table 2 assume that the quietest channel of each quartet has no excess variance .",
    "most such channels will in reality have non - zero , and positive excess variance .",
    "currently there is a direct degeneracy within each quartet between the value for the channel forced to zero and the overall level of stellar variance ( as given by the median over 0 to 70 ppm ) for all stars within the quartet .",
    "the @xmath0120 stars within each quartet are usually drawn from widely different and symmetric positions on the sky .",
    "therefore , even if there were intrinsic large scale ( but low order , say a gradient over the field ) variations of the stellar noise spatially , we should expect the quartets to all have similar levels of stellar variability .",
    "this provides a good and physically reasonable , albeit imperfect , means of renormalizing the variance levels within each quartet : we force the stellar medians to have a common value for all quartets via simple addition .",
    "this brings the full distribution of channel - by - channel variances to a common scale .",
    "the stellar variances are also brought to a common scale , although simple gradients of intrinsic variation across the focal plane should be preserved by this step .",
    "the problem at hand thus becomes one of determining what single number to adopt for the stellar quartet medians .",

    "may be thought of as the minimum value for this parameter , although this choice would lead to a large fraction of stars with apparent negative intrinsic variance .",
    "if instead we chose this value to be the overall mean of 378 ppm@xmath11 for the stellar medians over all 21 quartets , then quartets 2 , 5 , and 13 with low values of the stellar median would develop many channels with negative variance for the instrument noise contribution .",
    "there does not seem to be a well - defined quantitative approach to selecting this normalization .",
    "we will rather rely on showing the sensitivity to this choice and bringing in congruence with solar variability to support our ultimate selection .",
    "[ fig : gm.3hist ] shows the fractional distribution of noise values with three different choices of the normalization for the stellar median , from a minimal value of 300 ppm@xmath11 at top to 378 ppm@xmath11 at the bottom .",
    "such changes in the overall variance zero point between possible instrument terms and noise intrinsic to the stars makes a noticeable difference for the really quiet stars , but has much less influence on stars with higher intrinsic variability .",
    "the distribution of stellar noise seems to be bi - modal in character , with one peak in the neighborhood of typical solar variations , and a second peak at some 5 ppm higher values .",
    "in addition an extended tail to higher intrinsic noise exists for the more active stars .",
    "we adopt the 340 ppm@xmath11 variance level for the median intrinsic stellar noise over 0  70 ppm .",
    "having done this we may now present the results of table 2 in a different way .",
    "values in the column  stellar \" would now all be 340 by design .",
    "fifteen of the twenty - one quartets have stellar median values above 340 , for these the by - channel variances will be shifted to more positive values as the difference between these entries and 340 .",
    "there are six quartets for which the stellar median is smaller than this target of 340 ppm@xmath11 which has the consequence that at least the channels starting with zero variance will shift to non - physical , negative variance values .",
    "to assess how concerned we should be by finding a few channels coming in at negative additional variance it is useful to determine the noise levels that apply to the by - channel variance numbers in table 2 .",
    "we have done this by opening the magnitude range up slightly from 11.5  12.5 to 11.2  12.8 _ kp _ , thus doubling the number of available stars .",
    "then we have repeated the analyses leading to table 2 independently for stars with even or then odd kepler input catalog ( kic ) numbers . as expected",
    "this led to two sets each about as large as the number of stars in the table 2 sample .",
    "the gross features of derived values in these even and odd sets are very similar ; channels standing out as high in table 2 are high in each of the even and odd test sets , as they are for the distribution of stellar medians by quartet .",
    "the overall rms across the variances between the even and odd sets , after shifting all for consistency with a common stellar median of 340 ppm@xmath11 , is 60 ppm@xmath11 .",
    "the estimated standard deviation on the direct values in table 2 would be a factor of two smaller than this , or 30 ppm@xmath11 as a general confidence level estimate .",

    ".    the number of channels coming in with negative variance does not seem inconsistent with expected fluctuations given our measurement precision channel - to - channel .",
    "similarly , in fig .  [ fig : gm.3hist ] at the nominal 340 ppm@xmath11 median value some 4% of the stars overall have entries in the first bin which corresponds to those with a negative variance .",
    "stars with negative variance may arise from any channels that have significant gradients of intrinsic noise .",
    "then a quiet star , on the less noisy part of the channel could be driven to negative variance when the correction for the channel as a whole is applied . also , in some cases pdc will over - fit and remove actual noise , but this is not thought widespread .",
    "the existence of a small fraction of channels ascribed a negative intrinsic variance , and a few stars determined to have intrinsic variances less than zero , both of which are non - physical , is a signal that our determinations of these quantities introduces some broadening of intrinsic distributions .",

    "we adopt the set of * all * _ kp _ = 11.5 to 12.5 stars that were observed in each of quarters 2  6 as a set from which to randomly pull time series to be added with appropriate dilution depending upon relative magnitudes .",
    "since red giants are inherently much noisier than dwarfs , and many of these have been dropped @xcite from the planetary target list , we replicated the observed red giants to bring their total fraction up to 50% .",

    "over the 19.6 pixel aperture the number of stars per magnitude bin was adopted as tabulated in table 3 for three galactic latitudes .    to simulate the impact of unknown background stars , that if sufficiently variable would increase the apparent variability of the usually much brighter target star , we start with the 69,005 set of time series . for each star",

    "when the random selection probability indicates a contaminating background star should be added , a random draw from the set in number 2 above is made , diluting the added signal as the ratio of brightness of the background bin to the source star . when making this addition the similarly scaled median of the source star",
    "is subtracted so that we effectively add in just the variability , and not a zero point offset in total counts .",
    "only about 10% of _ kp _ = 12 stars based on table 3 would have a star within a @xmath20-magnitude of about 4 contributing , but summed to a @xmath20-magnitude of 10 the number of stars added in averaged about two at field center .",

    "the second consideration is to assess by how much the known levels of contamination are likely to contribute for formal estimates of intrinsic stellar noise . for each star",
    "we take the maximum contamination ( fraction of light within optimal aperture contributed by known neighbors ) over quarters 2 - 6 for the _ kp _ = 11.5 to 12.5 sample , the mean of this is 0.021 . using a similar approach as for the background stars , we take the contamination fraction as the dilution factor ( adjusted as well for the relative brightness of target and randomly drawn perturber ) , and always add in one randomly drawn additive star .",

    "the overall increase of medians and mean relative to the base from  3.5 are again negligible .    the estimates in this section can not be used to correct inferred stellar noise levels on a star - by - star basis , but do indicate that the impact of either known contaminating stars , or fainter , blended background variables is a statistically minor factor overall .",

    "having now derived noise terms covering contributions that change in time unique to each quarter , that arise from the detector channels , assigned poisson and readout noise , and intrinsic stellar noise , we may now examine this from a global perspective .",

    "the budget for stellar variability had been set to 10 ppm @xcite ; since this term is both the largest contributor overall , and twice the budgeted value , this term strongly deviates from expectations in a significant way . * the largest contributor to higher than expected cdpp is an intrinsic stellar variability significantly above expectations . *",
    "the second largest term at 16.8 ppm includes contributions from poisson noise on the target star itself , and much smaller contributions from poisson noise of the sky , and detector readout noise .",
    "the mean _ kp _ of this 11.5  12.5 sample of stars is 12.10 , and the irreducible terms for poisson noise and readout are entirely consistent with expectations .",
    "the third largest term at 10.8 ppm is a global average ( as variances ) over the 84 detector channels .",
    "since the detector noise contribution is well below the level of poisson noise this has little influence on the bottom - line cdpp .",
    "expectations were that a large number of imperfections in the electronics would combine to provide several ppm of equivalent noise , so what we find is broadly consistent with expectations , albeit marginally higher .",
    "finally , the quarter - to - quarter component of noise comes in at 7.8 ppm .",
    "this had not been explicitly budgeted for in cdpp estimates , and this term is dominated by q2 and q3 which both had excess noise from safing events , telescope repointing , and minor heater cycle / guiding issues that have since been brought under control .",
    "averaged over qs 46 this time - dependent term would be under 5 ppm .",
    "the final line of table 4 shows the sum of the four variance terms , and derived overall cdpp for the _ kp _ = 11.5 to 12.5 sample at 29.0 ppm .",
    "this is quite consistent , as it must be unless an inconsistency had arisen with the decompositions with a consistently derived cdpp value for the same stars .",
    "this value is 50% larger than the target of 20 ppm .",
    "had intrinsic stellar variations held to 10 ppm for a large fraction of the stars , instead of adopting a broad distribution extending beyond 20 ppm , then the noise roll up would be at 23.6 ppm .",
    "( part of this would be accounted for by our sample mean magnitude being fainter than 12.0 .",
    "a caution applies , though , that scalings in either magnitude , or time do nt have precisely the simple form expected due to a varying number of pixels as a function of magnitude and the stellar noise being red respectively . ) without the higher intrinsic stellar variability we are some 10% above the requirement of 20 ppm cdpp at _ kp _ = 12 , with the higher intrinsic noise from stars factored in we are some 50% above our noise requirement .",
    "it is now instructive to document the inferred excess noise by channel and the dependence of this excess on the instrument focus , which varies significantly over the focal plane .",

    "[ fig : gm.obs ] and shows the excess noise level as derived following the steps in  3.2 and 3.4 above .",
    "as argued in table 4 the overall contribution of this excess channel noise is rather modest for the cdpp error budget .",
    "nonetheless it is interesting to note that patterns in this noise exist , and seek at least a correlative explanation .",
    "[ fig : gm.varfoc ] shows the intrinsic excess variance by channel plotted versus the fractional central pixel energy content for a star centered on a pixel for that channel . the straight line is a simple least squares fit of variance with the focus proxy , assuming no error in the latter .",

    "this convincingly argues that there is no significant effect from intra - pixel sensitivity variations coupled with jitter .    in  3.6 we demonstrated that the large _ kepler _ apertures , which will lead to blended background ( or foreground ) stars , do not lead to significantly changed overall noise statistics when these blends are simulated .",
    "for a channel with soft focus ( low focus values in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm.varfoc ] ) , larger apertures are used to capture the target flux . this will lead to both larger values for the known contamination from nearby neighbors on the sky , and higher probabilities that unknown blended objects are within the aperture . using the simulations performed in  3.6 we have independently produced versions (",

    "these data suggest a power - law dependence of the form @xmath43 , with the observed rms variation for the sun being about 500ppm .",
    "as will be noted further below , the ground - based data generally pertain to timescales of weeks , while we are considering timescales of several hours .",
    "to check the calibration , we analyzed around 12yr of photometric `` sun - as - a - star '' observations ( used also in  3.3 ) made in the green wavelength channel of the virgo / spm instrument onboard the esa / nasa soho spacecraft ( frhlich et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the stellar observations referred to above were made in strmgren @xmath19 and @xmath44 , and should have a similar response to the narrowband green spm data .",
    "we divided the 12-yr spm lightcurve into contiguous 3-month datasets  corresponding to the quarter - long _ kepler _ datasets  and then reduced the cadence in each dataset from 60sec to 30min ( by averaging into 30-datum blocks ) .",
    "the rms variation due to stellar activity was then estimated ( the estimated contribution from granulation having first been removed ; see section  [ sec : estgran ] below ) . the estimated @xmath45 varied from about 150ppm at solar activity minimum to just over 600ppm at solar activity maximum , with an average value of around 350ppm .",
    "this average differs from the 500ppm solar value returned by the ground - based stellar observations , which may reflect the impact of different averaging lengths for the data ( a point we return to below , just after equation  [ eq : sigma1 ] .",
    "we therefore apply a multiplicative correction of @xmath46 to the empirical scalings suggested by the stellar data .",
    "two further corrections are applied .",
    "first , we make a multiplicative correction of @xmath47 to allow for the fact the _ kepler _ bandpass has significant width in wavelength resulting in a redder mean response by 20% compared to the narrowband green spm channel ( see section  [ sec : intrinsol ] above ) .",
    "second , we correct for the impact of the angles of inclination offered by the stars . as discussed in @xcite , as the angle of inclination is decreased from 90degrees to the most probable case of 57degrees so variations due to photometry will increase and those due to ca  h and k emission will decrease .",
    "@xcite modelled the expected changes for a sun - like star , and predicted that the aforementioned decrease in angle would lead to a @xmath48 increase in irradiance variability ( the _ kepler _ wavelength response is much closer to the irradiance response than it is to the strmgren @xmath19 and @xmath44 response ) .",

    "predict a negligible decrease in the absolute ca  h and k flux ( @xmath49 , a change which we choose to ignore here ) .",
    "the solar data come from observations where the angle of inclination offered by the sun is close to 90degrees .",
    "to correct the calibration to the most probable angle of 57degrees , we therefore multiply the average @xmath45 inferred from analysis of the solar data by the factor 1.05 .",
    "the stellar data presented in @xcite follow : @xmath50 application of the multiplicative corrections ( combined factor of @xmath51 ) gives our adopted empirical relation : @xmath52 implicit in our adoption of the above is that the exponent of the power - law dependence ( here , 1.75 ) does not change when the data are averaged on different timescales , i.e. , the temporal coverage of the ground - based stellar observations is such that their data provide variability information on timescales of several months to years , while ( in the absence of any other stellar reference ) we have used these data to calibrate changes on much shorter timescales .",
    "we have not included any perturbations to equation  [ eq : sigma1 ] to allow for the fact that we will be catching different stars in different phases of their stellar cycles , assuming instead that the impact of this variability will tend to average out over the ensemble .    with regards to the timescale of the activity , @xmath53 , we make the gross approximation of applying the solar timescale to all synthetic stars .",
    "analysis of the green spm channel data returned an estimate of @xmath54 , with the observed psd showing a reasonable match to the lorentzian form of equation  [ eq : psd ] .",
    "this timescale of course differs from the solar rotation period of @xmath55 , and reflects the complicated interplay between rotational modulation and the lifetimes of active regions on a timescale ( 3months ) that captures only three rotation periods .",
    "@xcite suggested that the rotational timescale may become dominant in more rapid rotators .",

    "to fix the rms of the granulation , @xmath60 , we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "this procedure assumes that the typical size of a convective granule is proportional to the scale height for an isothermal atmosphere , and that all granules behave in a statistically independent manner so that the total rms fluctuation scales inversely as the square root of the number of observed granules ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "use of the zero - frequency - centered lorentzian ( equation  [ eq : psd ] ) to describe the granulation provides a reasonable description of the observed psd at frequencies below the range occupied by the p modes .",
    "the lorentzian description does however appear to fail at higher frequencies ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , which is not a cause for concern here since the band - limited filtering used to construct the cdpp selects out psd only at very low frequencies ( see section  [ sec : est ] above ) .",

    "<S> , the results from _ kepler _ will vastly increase our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar - type stars . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of most interest for detection of exoplanets via transits . by design the data from moderately bright _ kepler _ </S>",
    "<S> stars are expected to have roughly comparable levels of noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamental limitations such as poisson statistics and any instrument noise . </S>",
    "<S> the noise levels attained by _ kepler _ on - orbit exceed by some 50% the target levels for solar - type , quiet stars . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a decomposition of observed noise for an ensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms ( poisson and readout noise ) , added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to the stars . the largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise follows from intrinsic stellar noise . </S>",
    "<S> we show that using stellar parameters from galactic stellar synthesis models , and projections to stellar rotation , activity and hence noise levels reproduces the primary intrinsic stellar noise features . </S>"
