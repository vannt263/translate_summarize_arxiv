    "low - mass dwarfs are the dominant stellar component of the galaxy .",
    "these ubiquitous stars , with main sequence lifetimes greater than the hubble time @xcite , have been employed in a variety of galactic studies : tracing galactic disk kinematics @xcite , describing age - velocity dispersion relations @xcite , and studying galactic structure components .",
    "modelling of their internal structure , atmospheric properties and magnetic activity presents interesting theoretical problems .",
    "observationally , the spectra of these stars are marked by the presence of strong molecular absorption features , particularly titanium oxide ( tio ) , which dominates the optical opacity of their cool atmospheres .",
    "the tio features , along with molecular bandheads introduced by vanadium oxide ( vo ) and calcium hydride ( cah ) are used to define the widely accepted m spectral subtype classification scheme @xcite .    in order to increase the utility of low - mass stars in large studies of galactic structure and dynamics ,",
    "we have been engaged in analyzing spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , resulting in a series of papers that describe our methods for photometrically selecting and spectral typing these objects @xcite and discussing their magnetic activity properties @xcite .",
    "however , we have been unable to exploit the velocity information contained in the spectra due to the inability of the sdss pipeline reductions to provide accurate velocites for m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "our motivation for the present work is the desire to produce a set of radial velocity templates by combining native , high - quality , sdss spectra at each spectral subtype in the m dwarf sequence .",
    "additionally , we split the spectra at each subtype into active and inactive stars , and examine the spectroscopic and photometric properties of these templates separately , to determine whether the activity is imprinting a signature that may affect our velocity analysis , and to followup on previous suggestions that colors and detailed absorption features may change depending on activity level .",
    "the radial velocity ( rv ) of an object is the projection of its intrinsic motion onto the line of sight of an observer . in order to accurately determine the rv of a given star",
    ", one must carefully address the systematics imposed by the time and location of the observation .",
    "this is usually accomplished by shifting the frame of the observer to a heliocentric ( sun - centered ) or barycentric ( center - of - mass centered ) rest frame .",
    "the standard method of determining stellar and galactic rvs has been cross - correlation , as introduced by @xcite .",
    "this method compares the spectrum of a science target against a known template , using cross - correlation to determine the wavelength shift ( and therefore velocity ) necessary to align the target with the template .",
    "thus , correlating with a template spectrum that is similar to the science target in all ways except velocity ensures the most accurate determination of the rv .    in the following sections , we report on our efforts to establish a set of low - mass star template spectra suitable for rv analysis using sdss spectra at medium ( r @xmath0 1,800 ) resolution . in  [ sec : data ] , we describe the observational material from the sdss and introduce the problems with the rvs reported for low - mass stars by the standard sdss spectroscopic pipeline .",
    "the observations were spectral - typed , inspected for signs of chromospheric activity , and coadded to form templates at each spectral type , as discussed in  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the resulting spectral templates , their accuracy as rv standards , and their spectral and photometric properties are detailed in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "our conclusions follow in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite has revolutionized optical astronomy . centered on the northern galactic cap , sdss has photometrically imaged @xmath0 8,000 sq . deg . in five filters ( @xmath1 ) to a faint limit of 22.2 mag in @xmath2 .",
    "this has resulted in photometry of @xmath0 180 million objects with typical photometric uncertainties of @xmath0 2% at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "sdss imaging has been invaluable in recent studies concerning low - mass dwarfs , particularly the colors of the m star sequence @xcite and the study of l and t spectral types @xcite .",
    "photometry acquired in sdss imaging mode is used to select spectroscopic followup targets .",
    "the photometry is analyzed by a host of targeting algorithms ( originally described in @xcite ) with the primary spectroscopic targets being galaxies @xcite , luminous red galaxies with z @xmath4 @xcite , and high redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "designed to acquire redshifts for @xmath0 1,000,000 galaxies and 100,000 quasars , twin fiber - fed spectrographs deliver 640 flux - calibrated spectra per 3@xmath5 diameter plate over a wavelength range of 3800 - 9200  with a resolution @xmath6 1,800 .",
    "typical observations are the coadded result of multiple 15 minute exposures , with observations continuing until the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel is @xmath7 4 at @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "typically , this takes about 3 exposures .",
    "wavelength calibrations , good to 5 km s@xmath10 or better @xcite , are carried out as described in @xcite .",
    "the spectra are then flux - calibrated using f subdwarf standards , with broadband uncertainties of 4% @xcite .",
    "these observations , obtained and reduced in a uniform manner , form a homogeneous , statistically robust dataset of over 673,000 spectra @xcite .",
    "sdss has already proven to be an excellent source of low - mass stellar spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the rvs determined for low - mass stars in the sdss pipeline are known to be inaccurate@xcite . these systematic errors , on the order of 10 km s@xmath10 @xcite result primarily from spectral mismatch , since there are only four low - mass stellar templates in the standard spectroscopic pipeline .",
    "thus , we sought to remedy this situation by establishing a uniform set of low - mass rv templates derived from sdss spectroscopy .",
    "to build a database of low - mass stellar spectra , we queried the data release 3 ( dr3 ; @xcite ) catalog archive server ( cas ) for spectra with late - type dwarf colors ( from @xcite ) , using @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the color ranges quoted in @xcite were slightly extended to increase the total number of low - mass stellar spectra .",
    "these color cuts were the only restrictions applied to the dr3 data .",
    "we treated each spectral subtype independently , performing 11 ( m0-l0 ) queries , some of which overlapped in color - color space ( see table [ table : colorcuts ] ) .",
    "thus , some spectra were selected twice , usually in neighboring spectral subtypes ( i.e. , m0 and m1 ) .",
    "these queries yielded @xmath0  133,000 candidate spectra in the 11 ( m0-l0 ) spectral type bins .",
    "the candidate spectra were examined with a suite of software specifically designed to analyze m dwarf spectra .",
    "this pipeline , as introduced in @xcite , measures a host of molecular band indices ( tio2 , tio3 , tio4 , tio5 , tio8 , cah1 , cah2 , and cah3 ) , and employs relations first described by @xcite to determine a spectral type from the strength of the tio5 bandhead .",
    "all spectral types were confirmed by manual inspection , adjusting the final spectral type , if necessary .",
    "the accuracy of the final spectral type is @xmath13 subtype .",
    "additionally , the software pipeline measures the equivalent width ( ew ) of the h@xmath14 line , quantifying the level of magnetic activity in a given low - mass dwarf .",
    "see @xcite for details on the measurement of bandheads and line strengths in low - mass star sdss spectra .",
    "inspection of each candidate spectrum allowed us to remove contaminants ( mostly galaxies ) from the sample , reducing its size to @xmath020,000 stellar spectra .",
    "we also removed the white dwarf - m dwarf pairs that were photometrically identified by @xcite .",
    "the database was then culled of duplicates . as shown in @xcite ( and table [ table : colorcuts ] ) , m dwarfs of different spectral types can possess similar sdss photometric colors .",
    "thus , some spectra with overlapping photometric colors were duplicated in our original database ( see  [ sec : analysis ] and table [ table : colorcuts ] ) . each duplicate spectrum was identified by filename and in cases where different spectral types were manually assigned by eye to the same star ( typically one subtype apart ) , the earlier spectral type was kept .",
    "the typical difference in spectral type was one subclass , in agreement with our stated accuracy .",
    "these various cuts reduced the sample from @xmath020,000 to @xmath012,000 stars .",
    "the spectra were then categorized based on their activity . in order to be considered active , a star had to meet the criteria originally described in @xcite : ( 1 ) the measured h@xmath14 ew is larger than 1.0  ; ( 2 ) the measured ew is larger than the error ; ( 3 ) the height of the h@xmath14 line must be three times the noise at line center ; ( 4 ) the measured ew must be larger than the average ew in two 50   comparison regions ( 6500 - 6550   and 6575 - 6625  ) . in order to be considered inactive , the measured ew had to be less than 1.0    and have a signal - to - noise ratio greater than three in the comparison regions .",
    "by selecting only these active and inactive stars , our final sample is limited to spectra with well - measured features , removing spectra with low signal - to - noise ratios . the resulting database consisted of @xmath06,000 stellar spectra .",
    "sdss spectra are corrected to a heliocentric rest frame during the standard pipeline reduction and are on a vacuum wavelength scale . to assemble the fiducial template spectra , stars of a given spectral type",
    "were first shifted to a zero - velocity rest frame , then normalized and coadded .",
    "multiple strong spectral lines were used to measure the velocity of each star to obtain an accurate shift to the rest frame . for inactive stars , the red line ( 7699  ) of the k i doublet and both lines of the na",
    "i doublet ( 8183 , 8195  ) were measured , while in active stars , h@xmath14 was also used .",
    "these spectral line combinations were selected for their strength in all low - mass stellar spectra , ensuring that no single line would determine the final velocity of a star .",
    "spectral lines were fit with single gaussians and inspected visually to ensure proper fitting .",
    "stars with spurious fits or discrepant line velocities ( lines which deviated from the mean by @xmath7 30 km s@xmath10 ) were removed from the final coaddition . removing these spectra reduced the final sample size to @xmath0 4,300 stars .",
    "the classical redshift correction was then applied to each spectrum in the final sample , justifying them to a zero - velocity rest frame .",
    "the velocity of each spectral line in the final sample was fit with an measurement uncertainty of @xmath0 10 km s@xmath10 , as determined by the mean scatter among individual line rv measurements . in wavelength space , this translates to about 0.2   resolution near h@xmath14 ( note the resolution of sdss ( r @xmath0 1,800 ) implies 3.6   resolution at h@xmath14 ) . since the observed spectrum is a discretization of a continuous flux source ( i.e. , the star ) , wavelength shifts introduced by the radial velocity of a star will move flux within and between resolution elements .",
    "these wavelength shifts , which are resolved to subpixel accuracy , act to increase the resolution of the final co - added spectrum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is similar to the common `` drizzle '' technique of using multiple , spatially distinct low - resolution images to produce a single high - resolution image @xcite .",
    "the wavelength - justified spectra were then normalized at 8350  and coadded ( with equal weighting of each spectrum ) using the following prescription . at each subtype",
    ", we attempted to construct three templates : one composed solely of active stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : active ] ) , one composed of inactive stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inactive ] ) , and a third composed of both the inactive and active stars from the previous two sets ( fig [ fig : all ] ) . for each template ,",
    "the mean and standard deviation were calculated at each pixel . in later ( @xmath7 m7 ) subtypes , the lack of spectra meeting our activity and velocity criteria resulted in fewer templates .",
    "the final template spectra ( figures [ fig : active]-[fig : all ] ) represent the mean spectral properties of low - mass dwarfs as observed by the sdss spectrographs . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] , we show illustrative examples of our templates for an inactive m1 star and an active m6 star , with strong atomic lines and molecular bandheads labeled .",
    "prominent molecules include mgh , cah , tio , vo and caoh .",
    "the active stars show the balmer series to h8 ( @xmath15 3889  ) along with ca ii h and k ( @xmath15 3968 , 3933  ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : hires ] we compare a high signal - to - noise sdss spectrum of an m5 star to its template counterpart in the region near h@xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that the template has significantly higher spectral resolution ; e.g. a weak feature near 6575   is visible only in the template . in the following sections , we explore the feasibility of using these templates as rv standards and the effects of chromospheric activity and metallicity on the mean spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of low - mass stars",
    ".      the primary uncertainties associated with determining rvs using the cross - correlation method are due to the resolution of the spectra , accuracy of the wavelength calibration and matching the spectral type of the template and science data . to ensure that the rvs measured with our templates are accurate ,",
    "we have carried out tests that quantify the internal consistency and external zero - point precision of these templates .",
    "these tests are described below .      to quantify the internal consistency among templates ,",
    "sequential spectral types were cross - correlated using the @xmath16 task in iraf .",
    "this minimizes the error introduced by spectral type mismatch , which often dominates the errors associated with cross - correlation redshift measurements @xcite .",
    "thus , wavelength calibration and intrinsic resolution are the major sources of uncertainty in our analysis . in all cases ( i.e.",
    ", active , inactive and combined templates ) the mean difference in velocity between adjacent spectral subtypes was @xmath17 1 km s@xmath10 .",
    "this compares favorably with the 3.5 km s@xmath10 spread in sdss data as reported by @xcite .",
    "note this value is derived from observations of stars in m67 @xcite , and does not include any low - mass dwarfs .    .",
    "note the higher resolution of the template spectrum . ]      to test the external accuracy of the template spectra , they were cross - correlated against hyades cluster members with well - measured rvs , observed as part of our sdss collaboration effort to produce rv standards for low - mass dwarfs .",
    "each hyades star has a known rv @xcite or is a confirmed member of the cluster , whose dispersion is @xmath18 1 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the hyades rvs in the literature were measured from high - resolution echelle spectra , with a typical accuracy of @xmath17 1 km s@xmath10 .",
    "thus , the sdss spectra of these hyads provide a way to check our cross - correlation rvs against an external standard system .",
    "the medium - resolution spectra of the hyades stars secured by sdss were correlated against our templates , with results shown in figure [ fig : rv_comp ] .",
    "the high - resolution echelle data have a mean of 38.8 km s@xmath10 and a standard deviation of 0.27 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the rvs measured with our template spectra yield a mean rv of 42.6 km s@xmath10 with a standard deviation of 3.2 km s@xmath10 .",
    "by comparison , the sdss pipeline rvs produced a mean velocity of 31.9 km s@xmath10 and a standard deviation of 6.8 km s@xmath10 ( after removing two highly discrepant measurements ) .",
    "using the template spectra better reproduces the coherent velocity signature of the hyades and provides much more reliable velocities than the standard sdss pipeline measurements .",
    "the templates are therefore well - suited for use as medium - resolution rv standards for low - mass dwarfs .",
    "the effect of magnetic activity on the spectral properties of a low - mass star is clearly manifested by the existence of emission lines .",
    "this effect is often quantified by measuring the luminosity in the h@xmath14 line divided by the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "other changes due to activity , such as varying strength of molecular bandheads @xcite and changes in the shape of the continuum have been sparsely investigated .",
    "additionally , metallicity affects the strength of molecular bandheads at a given temperature ( see @xcite ) . using the template spectra as fiducial examples of thin - disk , solar - metallicity low - mass stars ,",
    "we next examine changes in the spectral properties of low - mass stars introduced by magnetic activity and metallicity .",
    "emission features are dependent on the temperature and density structure of the outer stellar atmosphere .",
    "the line fluxes of the balmer series lines and the ca ii k line ( @xmath20  ) can be used to examine the structure of the chromosphere in magnetically active stars @xcite and to investigate chromospheric heating in quiescent ( i.e. non - flaring ) dme stars .",
    "the balmer decrement ( ratios of balmer line strengths to a fiducial , here taken to be h@xmath21 ) is traditionally used to quantify medium - resolution spectra .",
    "table [ table : decrements ] gives the balmer series and ca ii k decrements for the active templates .",
    "there is no strong trend in the decrement with spectral type for the template spectra , which is consistent with the previous study of , who reported average decrements over a range of k and m spectral types .",
    "however , both the templates and show a gradual increase in the h@xmath22h@xmath21 ratio with spectral type ( see table [ table : decrements ] ) . evidently the structure and heating of low - mass stellar chromospheres remains fairly similar over the range of m dwarf effective temperature ( mass ) , with the h@xmath14 gradually becoming stronger relative to the higher order balmer lines at later spectral type .",
    "the balmer decrements observed in ad leo ( dm3e ) during a large flare @xcite and determined for quiescent and flaring model atmospheres @xcite are given in table [ table : decrements ] for comparison . in figure",
    "[ fig : decrements ] , we plot these observed and model decrements together with the average balmer decrements of the active low - mass stellar templates .",
    "the flare decrements , both observed and model , are much flatter than those in the non - flaring atmospheres , suggesting ( though within the errors ) increased emission in the higher order balmer lines .",
    "this probably reflects the higher chromospheric densities ( hence greater optical depth in the balmer line - forming region ) in the flare atmospheres .",
    "evidently the range in chromospheric properties among m dwarfs of different spectral types is much less ( during quiescent periods ) than in a given star between its quiet and flaring behavior .    for completeness , the average balmer line and ca ii k ews and the quantity @xmath19 measured from the active templates",
    "are reported in table [ table : ew ] .",
    "@xmath19 which is used to quantify activity , was calculated using the h@xmath14 ew and the ( @xmath23 ) continuum ( @xmath24 ) relation of @xcite , as first described in @xcite .",
    "the average ews reported in table [ table : ew ] agree with previous results @xcite .",
    "the general increase toward later types is attributed to the lower continuum flux in the vicinity of h@xmath14 as the stellar effective temperature decreases .",
    "the @xmath19 ratios are also consistent with previous studies @xcite , attaining a relatively constant value ( with large scatter ) among early - mid m ( m0-m5 ) types , and decreasing at later types .    .",
    "the result is a relatively flatter decrement . ]",
    "molecular rotational and vibrational transitions imprint large bandheads on the observed spectra of low - mass stars .",
    "the strength of the tio bandheads in the visible is often used as a spectral - type discriminant @xcite .",
    "additionally , caoh , tio and cah bandheads have been employed as temperature and metallicity indicators @xcite . following previous conventions",
    "@xcite , we provide measurements for the cah bandheads at  @xmath0  6400  ( cah1 ) , @xmath0  6800  ( cah2,cah3 ) in table [ table : cah ] , and for the tio bandheads at @xmath0  7050  ( tio2,tio4,tio5 ) and @xmath0  8430  ( tio8 ) in table [ table : tio ] . note that tio2 and tio4 are sub - bands of the full tio5 bandhead .",
    "as first observed by @xcite , activity can introduce changes in the tio bandheads @xcite . shown in figure [ fig : tio2tio4 ]",
    "is the tio2 index as a function of the tio4 index . for active stars ,",
    "the strength of the tio2 bandhead is increased ( smaller index ) at a given value of the tio4 index . alternately , at a given index of tio2 ,",
    "the tio4 index is weaker in active stars .",
    "this provides interesting constraints on the structure of the atmosphere , suggesting that the formation of tio , thought to take place near the temperature minimum region below the chromospheric temperature rise @xcite , is affected by the presence of an overlying chromosphere .",
    "the opposite behavior of these two sub - bands serves to decrease the sensitivity of tio5 to chromospheric activity , making it a good temperature ( spectral - type ) proxy regardless of the activity level of the star ( see @xcite ) .",
    "two main effects influence the colors of active stars : the presence of emission lines and changes in the continuum emission .",
    "to investigate these effects , we divided the active templates by their inactive counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig : ratios ] is an illustrative example of our analysis , showing the individual active and inactive m0 template spectra together with the ratio of the active to inactive flux .",
    "the approximate wavelength bounds of the sdss @xmath25 and @xmath26 filters are indicated .",
    "the ratio shows enhanced blue continuum emission in the active template , and significantly enhanced emission lines , particularly in ca ii h and k. these effects lead to a bluer ( @xmath27 ) color for the active star ( see table [ table : colors ] , discussed further in  [ sec : photcolors ] below ) .",
    "the change in color is dominated by the continuum enhancement , with the increased emission line flux providing only a marginal effect .",
    "similar continuum and line flux enhancements are observed during flares , suggesting that the active m0 template may include one or more stellar spectra obtained during low level flaring conditions .",
    "as described in @xcite , low level flaring maybe responsible for a significant fraction of the `` quiescent '' chromospheric emission observed on active stars .",
    "the ratio also shows two `` emission '' lines in the @xmath2 band corresponding to emission in the core of the na i d doublet ( @xmath155900  , doublet marginally resolved at sdss resolution , but well resolved in our templates ) and in h@xmath14 .",
    "again , these lines do not significantly contribute to the combined flux of the template in the @xmath2 band , as shown by the marginally redder @xmath28 color for the active template in table [ table : colors ] .",
    "the spectral flux ratio in the @xmath26 band is very close to unity , with no strongly varying emission or continuum features between the active and inactive templates .",
    "this analysis suggests that changes in the continuum emission of active stars provide the most important contribution to observed color differences .",
    "the variable strength of the caoh ( 6230  ) bandhead is also of note . shown in figure [ fig : caoh ] are the active to inactive ratios for m4-m7 subtypes .",
    "the growth of this feature indicates there is some dependence of the formation mechanism of caoh on spectral type ( effective temperature , mass ) , perhaps changing the position of the temperature minimum within the atmosphere .",
    "note that the feature near this wavelength previously discussed as a good temperature indicator by @xcite is actually due to tio in early m dwarfs .",
    "caoh begins to dominate the opacity in this region only at types later than m4 , which were not available to observation in the clusters described by @xcite .",
    "therefore these new sdss observations are the first evidence of a real effect in the caoh band that differs with the presence of a chromosphere and changes with spectral type .",
    "these observations , together with the differences in the tio2 and tio4 bands should provide strong constraints on the next generation of atmospheric models ( including chromospheres ) for m dwarfs .",
    ", @xmath2 , and @xmath26 filters . ]",
    "we explored the effects of metallicity on the spectra by comparing our composite templates to a low - metallicity subdwarf ( [ fe / h ] @xmath29 ; @xcite ) and a metal - rich hyades dwarf ( [ fe / h ] = 0.13 , @xcite ) , both observed with sdss .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : metalratios ] .",
    "previous studies @xcite indicate that subdwarfs are @xmath0 0.2 mags redder than solar - metallicity stars in @xmath27 .",
    "this is most likely due to the multiple hydride bands present in the @xmath30 filter @xcite .",
    "the region between 4000 - 4500  in figure [ fig : metalratios ] ( left panel ) shows that the flux in the subdwarf is depressed by @xmath0 60% compared to the level present in the composite template .",
    "strong hydride bands , such as mgh near 5000  and cah bands near 6800  are also depressed .",
    "these bands are labeled in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "in contrast , the metal - rich hyades star ( right panel of fig . [ fig : metalratios ] ) shows mostly enhanced but variable continuum in the @xmath30 band , which is difficult to attribute to any particular feature .",
    "there is enhanced emission in the core of na i d and ca ii h and k , but these are likely not strong enough to influence the colors .",
    "unfortunately we do not have colors in the sdss filters , measured with the 2.5 m sdss telescope , for the hyades stars , and therefore can not directly compare the spectral features with measured color differences between the metal - rich stars and our templates .",
    "photometry was obtained from the sdss cas for each star used in constructing the templates .",
    "the average colors for each template are listed in table [ table : colors ] by spectral type .",
    "previous studies have been inconclusive , suggesting that active stars are marginally bluer in @xmath31 , redder in @xmath32 @xcite or not statistically different from inactive populations for sdss colors @xcite .",
    "we computed the color difference for each spectral subtype ( active color - inactive color ) and averaged over spectral type .",
    "the data in table [ table : colors ] indicate the following general trends : active stars are @xmath33 mags bluer than their non - active counterparts in @xmath34 , while they are @xmath35 mags redder in @xmath23 .",
    "we note that while these trends are suggestive , but are within the scatter .",
    "no strong trends were present in @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "our goal was to link changes in the spectral features to differences in photometric colors . due to the spectral coverage of the sdss spectra , we are only able to investigate the @xmath27 and @xmath28 colors in detail , which did not demonstrate any discernible trends with activity .",
    "the bluer @xmath27 color in the m0 active template appears to be anomalous , and from the spectral analysis , may be due to low level flaring - see  [ sec : specfeatures ] .",
    "this may also be simply due to the small number of spectra associated with the active m0 template .",
    "however , the photometric trend in @xmath34 , where active stars were an average of @xmath0 0.09 mags bluer than inactive stars , may be reflecting the presence of similar low level flaring in many of the active templates , as the enhanced blue continuum during flares will appear even more strongly in the @xmath36 band @xcite .    the small number of m subdwarfs identified in the sdss database , and the lack of sdss photometry for the hyades",
    "m dwarfs prevented us from investigating color differences due to metallicity .",
    "as noted in the previous section , @xcite showed that m subdwarfs are @xmath0 0.2 mags redder in @xmath27 than their solar - metallicity counterparts .",
    "we used the large sdss spectral database from dr3 to form active , inactive and composite template spectra of m dwarfs spanning types m0-l0 , on a uniform , zero - velocity scale .",
    "our spectral templates provide suitable radial velocity standards for analyzing spectra with r@xmath0 1,800 , with an external accuracy of 3.8 km s@xmath37 , within the quoted error associated with the wavelength scale for sdss spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "internally , the templates are consistent to @xmath18 1 km s@xmath37 .",
    "the magnetically active templates , as identified by the presence of h@xmath14 emission in the individual stellar spectra , showed little difference in the measured balmer decrements with spectral type , indicating that chromospheric structure and heating are apparently similar through the m dwarf sequence .",
    "flares cause much larger changes in the decrement .",
    "we found some evidence that color changes ( active stars appearing bluer in @xmath34 and in one case in @xmath27 ) are due primarily to blue continuum enhancements in the active stars , which may be due to intermittent low - level flaring .",
    "in general , chromospheric line emission has a negligible effect on the colors of active stars .",
    "molecular bands including tio2 , tio4 and caoh showed significant changes between the active and inactive templates .    with regard to metallicity , our findings",
    "extend the earlier study by @xcite , which found subdwarfs to be @xmath0 0.2 mags redder in @xmath27 .",
    "our spectral analysis shows that the flux in the blue is depressed by as much as 60% , and that the strong mgh and cah bands are significantly deeper in the subdwarfs .",
    "the spectral analysis of metal - rich hyades stars ( [ fe / h ] = 0.13 , @xcite ) showed continuum differences , but these were not obviously attributed to any particular features .",
