    "<S> +    the structure function of the photon is described at large scales @xmath0 by the qcd improved parton model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected however that in the low @xmath0 region the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) contribution @xcite may also become important . here , as usual , @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the four momentum of the virtual photon probing the real photon with four momentum @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the cm energy squared @xmath9 of the @xmath10 system is @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> + in this talk we wish to present the representation of the photon structure function which includes both the vmd contribution together with the qcd improved parton model term suitably extrapolated to the low @xmath0 region . </S>",
    "<S> this representation of the photon structure function is based on the extension of similar representation of the nucleon structure function to the case of the photon `` target '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possible parametrization of the photon structure function which extends to the low @xmath0 region has also been discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there do also exist several microscopic models describing the energy dependence of the total @xmath12 cross - section @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + our representation of the structure function @xmath13 is based on the following decomposition : @xmath14 where in what follows we shall consider the structure function of the photon , i.e. @xmath15 . the terms @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the vmd and partonic contributions respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the vmd part is given by the following formula : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the vector meson @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the @xmath22 total cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath23 can be determined from the leptonic widths @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath25 the partonic contribution is expressed in terms of the structure function @xmath26 obtained from the qcd improved parton model analysis of the photon structure function in the large @xmath0 region @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29 denoting the bjorken variable , i.e. @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath31 should have its magnitude greater than the mass squared of the heaviest vector meson included in the vmd part and its value will be taken to be the same as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , i.e. @xmath32 gev@xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> + the @xmath34 total cross - section @xmath2 is related in the following way to the photon structure function : @xmath35 after taking in equation ( [ sigma ] ) the limit @xmath36 ( for fixed @xmath37 ) we obtain the total cross - section @xmath38 corresponding to the interaction of two real photons . </S>",
    "<S> the representation ( [ dec ] ) and equations ( [ vmd ] ) and ( [ partons ] ) give the following expression for this cross - section :    @xmath39    in the large @xmath0 region the structure function given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dec ] ) becomes equal to the qcd improved parton model contribution @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the vmd component gives the power correction term which vanishes as ( @xmath41 ) for large @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the modifications of the qcd parton model contribution ( i.e. replacement of the parameter @xmath29 by @xmath42 defined by equation ( [ xbar ] ) , the shift of the scale @xmath43 and the factor @xmath44 instead of 1 ) are also negligible at large @xmath0 and introduce the power corrections which vanish as @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> + in the quantitive analysis of @xmath45 and of @xmath38 we have taken the @xmath26 from the lo analysis presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the vmd part was estimated using the following assumptions :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the numerical values of the couplings @xmath46 are the same as those used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they were estimated from relation ( [ gammav ] ) which gives the following values : @xmath47 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the cross - sections @xmath48 are represented as the sum of the reggeon and pomeron contributions : @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the pomeron couplings @xmath54 are related to the corresponding couplings @xmath55 controlling the pomeron contributions to the total @xmath56 cross - sections assuming the additive quark model and reducing the total cross - sections for the interaction of strange quarks by a factor equal 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives : @xmath57 + @xmath58 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> the reggeon couplings @xmath59 are estimated assuming additive quark model and duality ( i.e. dominance of planar quark diagrams ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that the quark couplings to a photon are proportional to the quark charge with the flavour independent proportionality factor . </S>",
    "<S> this gives : @xmath60 + @xmath61 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> the couplings @xmath55 and @xmath62 are taken from the fit discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which gave : @xmath63    in fig.1 we compare our predictions with the data on @xmath64 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show experimental points corresponding to the `` low '' energy region ( @xmath65 10 gev ) @xcite and the recent preliminary high energy data obtained by the l3 and opal collaborations at lep @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the representation ( [ sgamgam ] ) for the total @xmath12 cross - section describes the data reasonably well . it should be stressed that our prediction is essentially parameter free . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the cross - section is dominated by the vmd component yet the partonic part is also non - negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the latter term is in particular responsible for generating steeper increase of the total cross - section with increasing @xmath37 than that embodied in the vmd part which is described by the soft pomeron contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the total cross - section with increasing energy in the low @xmath37 region is controlled by the reggeon component of the vmd part ( see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rpgv ] ) , ( [ rgv ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) ) and by the valence part of the partonic contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we show predictions for the total @xmath12 cross - section as the function of the total cm energy @xmath37 in the wide energy range which includes the energies that might be accessible in future linear colliders . we also show in this figure the decomposition of @xmath64 into its vmd and partonic components . we see that at very high energies these two terms exhibit different energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the vmd part is described by the soft pomeron contribution which gives the @xmath66 behaviour with @xmath67 = 0.0808 ( [ lambda ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the partonic component increases faster with energy since its energy dependence reflects increase of @xmath68 with decreasing @xmath42 generated by the qcd evolution @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ]    this increase is stronger than that implied by the soft pomeron exchange . as the result the total @xmath12 cross - section , which is the sum of the vmd and partonic components does also exhibit stronger increase with the increasing energy than that of the vmd component . </S>",
    "<S> it is however milder than the increase generated by the partonic component alone , at least for @xmath69 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the fact that in this energy range the magnitude of the cross - section is still dominated by its vmd component . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for sufficiently high energies @xmath37 the total @xmath70 cross - section @xmath64 described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sgamgam ] ) can be parametrized by the effective power law dependence @xmath71 with @xmath72 slowly increasing with energy within the range @xmath73 for 30 gev @xmath74 10@xmath75 gev . </S>",
    "<S> +    [ fig : fig3 ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we compare our predictions for @xmath76 based on equations([dec ] , [ vmd ] , [ partons ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) with the experimental data in the low @xmath0 region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that in this case the model is also able to give a good description of the data . </S>",
    "<S> + finally in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show our results for @xmath76 plotted as the function of @xmath0 for different values of the total cm energy @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that for low values @xmath0 the cross - section does only weakly depend upon @xmath0 . in the large @xmath0 region </S>",
    "<S> it follows the @xmath41 scaling behaviour modulated by the logarithmic scaling violations implied by perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> +    [ fig : fig4 ]    to sum up we have presented an extension of the representation developed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the nucleon structure function @xmath77 for arbitrary values of @xmath0 , onto the structure function of the real photon . </S>",
    "<S> this representation includes both the vmd contribution and the qcd improved parton model component suitably extrapolated to the region of low @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that it is fairly succesful in describing the experimental data on @xmath38 and on @xmath76 at low @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also showed that one can naturally explain the fact that the increase of the total @xmath12 cross - section with increasing cm energy @xmath37 is stronger than that implied by soft pomeron exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated total @xmath12 cross - section was found to exhibit approximate power - law increase with increasing energy @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath78 with @xmath72 slowly increasing with energy within the range @xmath73 for 30 gev @xmath74 10@xmath75 gev . </S>"
