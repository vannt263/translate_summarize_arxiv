    "through centuries , the stability of different phenomena has been studied by means of the bifurcation theory .",
    "mathematically , the observed states are modeled as solutions of nonlinear equations , a mathematical context where the intuitive notion of stability is made precise . roughly speaking",
    ", one expects that a slight change of a parameter in a system should not have great influence , but rather that stable solutions change continuously in a unique way .",
    "that expectation is verified by the implicit function theorem .",
    "consequently , as long as a continuous branch of solutions preserves its stability , no dramatic change is observed when the parameter is varied .",
    "however , if that _ ground state _ loses its stability when the parameter reaches a critical value , then the state is no longer observed , and the system itself organizes a new stable state that _ bifurcates _ from the ground state .    in @xcite , smoller and wasserman present a simple criterion based on the index morse determining the existence of bifurcation points which , together with the implicit function theorem , has enabled several authors to study different stability problems .",
    "for instance , bettiol and piccione @xcite used this technique to obtain results about the existence and non - existence of metrics with constant scalar curvature and as close as desired to a given homogeneous metric on the sphere .",
    "jin , lin and xu in @xcite obtained some multiplicity results for the yamabe equation on the sphere @xmath0 .",
    "recently , ramrez - ospina @xcite proved the existence of uncountably many unit volume constant scalar curvature metrics in product manifolds @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a flat @xmath3-torus and @xmath4 is a compact manifold . among all these works",
    ", we point out one authored by alas and piccione @xcite , where it is shown the existence of an infinite sequence of isometric embeddings of tori with constant mean curvature ( cmc ) in euclidean spheres that are not isometrically congruent to the cmc clifford torus .    motivated by this work , we propose to study the rigidity of families of cmc hypersurfaces in different ( and more general ) contexts . roughly speaking ,",
    "a family @xmath5 of cmc hypersurfaces is ( locally ) rigid if given any other cmc hypersurface @xmath6 which is sufficiently close to some element of @xmath5 , then @xmath6 must be _ congruent _ to some element of @xmath5 ( see section  [ sub : niftheory ] for details ) .",
    "constant mean curvature hypersurfaces have a well - known variational characterization as critical points of the area functional under variations preserving certain volume . our aim is to show when a family of hypersurfaces is rigid or it has some bifurcation point .",
    "a natural occurrence of foliations by cmc hypersurfaces appears in certain warped product spaces , which are the main object of our study .",
    "finally , we will apply our results to the spatial fiber of the so - called de sitter and anti - de sitter schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "these classical solutions of the vacuum einstein equation for static , spherically symmetric spacetimes describe the simplest model of a black hole which is known .",
    "recently , these spaces have received an increasing attention , especially with the so - called ads / cft correspondence ( or maldacena duality ) , a conjectured equivalence between a string theory on a _ bulk _ space ( typically , the product of anti - de sitter spaces by round spheres ) and a quantum field theory without gravity on the _ boundary _ of the initial space , which behaves as an hologram of lower dimension ( see @xcite for a detailed introduction on the topic ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we establish the basic notions of bifurcation and local rigidity ; and we present the variational setting in which we will work .",
    "the bifurcation phenomenon under volume - preserving variations of cmc hypersurfaces is analyzed in section 3 .",
    "as a first step , we consider the case of families of cmc hypersurfaces whose associated potential function of the jacobi operator is constant ( see ) .",
    "for this general setting , including the space of cmc hypersurfaces which are orbits for some isometric action of a lie group ( as it happens in the warped product case ) , we obtain simple sufficient conditions to guarantee the stability of an one - parameter family of hypersurfaces .",
    "our main results are summarized in the following statements ( see theorem [ teo1 ] , corollary [ cor1 ] and remark [ hypopen ] ( i ) for details ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be a family of cmc hypersurfaces in an @xmath8-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath9 .",
    "assume that , for each @xmath10 the map @xmath11 is constant on @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the squared norm of the second fundamental of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the normalized ricci curvature of @xmath4 evaluated at @xmath16 the unit normal to @xmath17 .",
    "then , the family @xmath18 is rigid for all @xmath10 if @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the first nonzero eigenvalue of the laplacian defined on @xmath14 with the induced metric .",
    "in particular , such a family is rigid if one of the following statements hold :    * @xmath14 is convex is convex if and only if its second fundamental form is positive definite with respect to the inward normal direction .",
    "] and has non - positive ricci curvature , * @xmath21 , * @xmath14 is ricci flat and @xmath22 , where @xmath20 is the first nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath23 on @xmath14 .",
    "for the particular case of warped product spaces , we give sufficient conditions for both the existence and non - existence of bifurcation points .",
    "the results for this case are summarized as follow ( see propositions [ prop2.3 ] , [ prop5.1 ] for more details ) .",
    "let @xmath24 be a warped product space where @xmath25 is an @xmath26-dimensional closed ( compact and without boundary ) manifold ; and consider the one - parameter family of cmc hypersurfaces @xmath27 .    * if @xmath28 for all @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the first non - zero eigenvalue of the laplacian on @xmath31 , then @xmath27 has no bifurcation point . *",
    "if @xmath32 then , there exists an infinite sequence of bifurcation points .",
    "furthermore , we give some geometric conditions ( on terms of the scalar and mean curvatures of warped product and the scalar curvature of its fiber ) , which allow us to ensure the rigidity of an one - parameter family of cmc hypersurfaces in a warped product , see corollary [ corsc ] .",
    "this type of situation occurs in general relativity , and we will discuss in section 4 an application of these results to the spatial fiber of the de sitter and anti - de sitter schwarszchild spacetimes . we show that the family of spheres around the blackhole are locally rigid for the former ( including the classical schwarszchild spacetime ) while the collapsing spheres on the latter have infinitely many bifurcation points .",
    "let us state some of the basic elements , results and notations that we are going to use in the rest of the paper . along this paper , we will consider an @xmath8-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath33 . in general , a local coordinate system will be denoted by @xmath34 and , in the adapted case for the boundary",

    "assume that we also have a continuous path of critical points @xmath45 of the corresponding functionals , that is , @xmath46 .",
    "fix @xmath47 .",
    "we will say that @xmath48 is _ a point of bifurcation _ if there exists a sequence @xmath49 and a sequence @xmath50 satisfying :    * @xmath51 and @xmath52 , * @xmath53 for all @xmath8 , * @xmath54 for all @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath48 is not a bifurcation point , we will just say that the family @xmath55 is _ locally rigid _ at @xmath48 .",
    "one of the classical criterion to determine when a point is of bifurcation is related with the so - called _",
    "morse index_. recall that the morse index of a critical point @xmath56 of a smooth functional @xmath57 is equal to the dimension of the maximal subspace of the tangent space @xmath58 where the second variation @xmath59 is negative definite .",

    "essentially , a variation of the morse index @xmath61 along the interval @xmath44 will indicate the existence of a bifurcation point ( see for instance @xcite for details ) .",

    "in particular , if @xmath70 for all @xmath43 in @xmath44 , then there is no bifurcation point .    in this paper , using the above conditions , we will study local rigidity and bifurcation by analyzing the spectrum of @xmath71 for all @xmath43 . essentially , we will determine the number of negative eigenvalues for each @xmath43 ( counting its multiplicity ) and we will study the evolution of such a number as @xmath43 runs along @xmath44 .",
    "let us recall the classical variational setup of the constant mean curvature ( cmc ) hypersurfaces as critical points of the area functional under variations preserving the volume .    in order to use the bifurcation theory above",
    "mentioned , let us describe the elements involved in this approach .",

    ", we are going to be interested in the so - called _ normal _ variations .",
    "a hypersurface variation @xmath84 is normal if the variation vector field @xmath89 is parallel to the unit normal vector field @xmath90 with respect to @xmath91 and the volume is preserved .",
    "in particular , if we denote by @xmath92 the linear subspace of @xmath93 only determined by normal variations , we can deduce that @xmath92 is naturally identified with the set of smooth functions with compact support @xmath94 , where such an identification is essentially obtained by defining @xmath95 for a normal variation @xmath84 .",
    "for the volume - preserving property , let us recall that the volume form varies as    @xmath96\\times { \\partial \\omega}}x^*(dv).\\ ] ]    and so , the normal variations has an associated function @xmath97 satisfying    @xmath98    finally , we will consider the area functional restricted to such a volume - preserving variations .",
    "the lagrange multiplier method leads us then to the functional @xmath99 defined as :    @xmath100    where @xmath43 varies on a prescribed interval @xmath44 ( to be determined later ) .",

    "so , that the first variation of our functional takes the following form    @xmath105    therefore , the critical points of @xmath99 under normal variations are open subsets of @xmath4 such that its boundaries are cmc - hypersurfaces with @xmath106 .",
    "[ hypopen][hypboundos](i ) it is important to remark that , for these computations , there is no real dependence on the open set @xmath91 but on the hypersurface @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , in the literature , it is more common to work in terms of hypersurfaces .",
    "however , for simplicity on this case , we have preferred this approach of open sets .",

    "under this assumption , the critical points of the functional will be open subsets @xmath91 such that their boundaries are union of a ( fixed ) set @xmath112 and a cmc hypersurface @xmath113 .",
    "as we are interested in rigidity results , we need to study the second variation of the functional on the critical points or , more precisely , its spectrum .",
