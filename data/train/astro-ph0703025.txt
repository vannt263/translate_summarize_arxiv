    "colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of most open clusters ( ocs ) feature age - dependent stellar sequences such as fractions of the main sequence ( ms ) , turnoff ( to ) and giant branch ( gb ) , that provide essential information to derive their reddening , age and distance from the sun . in this sense ,",
    "ocs have been used as probes of galactic disc properties ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the proximity of most ocs to the plane and the corresponding strong reddening and field star ( fs ) contamination , especially for ocs projected against the central parts of the galaxy , usually restrict this analysis to the more populous ocs and/or those located a few kpc from the sun ( @xcite , and references therein ) . using a sample of 654 ocs with available fundamental parameters , @xcite found that a large fraction of the intrinsically faint and/or distant ocs must be drowned in the field , particularly in bulge / disc directions .",
    "they estimate a total population of @xmath3 ocs in the galaxy , in agreement with @xcite .    because they are minority in catalogues , ocs projected towards the central parts of the galaxy are of particular interest .",
    "studies like the present one can provide means to unambiguously unveil the nature of such potential candidates , which is essential to establish the fraction of star clusters as compared to statistical fluctuations of the dense stellar field in those directions .    reliable fundamental parameters of unstudied ocs are important both to disc studies and to constrain theories of molecular cloud fragmentation , star formation , as well as stellar and dynamical evolutions",
    ". structural and dynamical - related parameters of star clusters can be used to investigate whether the apparent scarcity of ocs inside the solar circle is due to observational limitations in dense stellar fields or enhanced tidal disruption rates because of proximity to the bulge and/or higher rates of collisions with molecular clouds ( @xcite , and references therein ) .    as a first step a series of faint ocs",
    "were studied using near - ir ,  and  photometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) obtained from the 2mass point source catalogue ( psc ) .",
    "2mass spatial and photometric uniformity has been important to derive fundamental parameters and probe the nature of these objects , because it allows extraction of large surrounding fields that provide high star - count statistics in the near - ir .    to this purpose",
    "we have developed quantitative tools to disentangle cluster and field stars in cmds , in particular two different kinds of filters .",
    "basically we apply _",
    "( i ) _ fs decontamination to uncover cluster evolutionary sequences from the field , which is important to derive reddening , age and distance from the sun , and _",
    "( ii ) _ colour - magnitude ( cm ) filters , which proved to be essential for building intrinsic stellar radial density profiles ( rdps ) , as well as luminosity and mass functions .",
    "in particular , fs decontamination constrains more the age and distance from the sun , especially for low - latitude ocs ( @xcite ) .",
    "these tools were applied to ocs and embedded clusters to enhance ms and/or pre - ms sequences with respect to the field ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they were useful also in the analysis of faint and/or distant ocs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in addition , more constrained structural parameters such as core ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and limiting radii (  and , respectively ) , and mass function ( mf ) slopes have been derived from cm - filtered photometry , allowing inferences on cluster dynamical state ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the present work investigates photometric and structural properties of six ocs or candidates in dense stellar fields : ngc5715 , lyng4 , lyng9 , trumpler23 , trumpler26 and czernik37 .",
    "they were included in early catalogues of star clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) , but only recently some of them have been analysed . from 4 to 6 catalogues ( cols .  1 and 13 of table  [ tab1 ] ) considered these objects as ocs or candidates on plate materials .",
    "hereafter we will adopt the acronyms ly , tr and cz .",
    "the objects are projected within @xmath4 of the galactic centre .",
    "ngc5715 , ly4 , tr23 , ly9 and tr26 are located in the 4th quadrant while cz37 is in the 1st quadrant .",
    "we are dealing with very low latitude objects , all with @xmath1 . clearly , they are ideal targets to be analysed with decontamination methods .",
    "tr23 and tr26 are used to compare cluster parameters obtained by means of different decontamination approaches and observational data sets , and to further probe their properties .",
    "cluster parameters for ngc5715 , ly4 , ly9 and cz37 are derived for the first time .    to be considered as a high - probability star cluster , a candidate must present both a fs - decontaminated cmd morphology and cm - filtered stellar rdp consistent with those of typical ocs .",
    "a third criterion would be a cluster - like mf .",
    "however , since mfs change with cluster age and are environment dependent ( @xcite , and references therein ) , they do not provide enough constraints to confirm or rule out oc - candidates .",
    "the density of stars in the direction of the present objects is unprecedented as compared to our previous efforts to explore ocs in general .",

    "star clusters form in collapsing molecular clouds in which variable fractions ( 10  60% ) of the parent gas are converted into stars .",
    "they remain embedded in the clouds for about 2 - 5myr ( e.g. @xcite ) , and their dynamical state at that early phase can be described as out of virial equilibrium ( e.g. @xcite ) . following the rapid expulsion of the unused gas by massive winds and supernovae , stars end up with excessive velocities with respect to the new , decreased , potential ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "clusters grow in all scales as they reach for virialization",
    ". n - body simulations of massive star clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) show that after a few @xmath27yr , core growth levels off as some energy equipartition is reached , a phase that is followed by a decrease in core size .",
    "the outer parts , on the other hand , keep increasing in size . at some point",
    ", the intrinsic cluster size may no longer be observable because of the increased volume and low number - density of cluster stars at large radii .",
    "the external parts may become indistinguishable from the background , particularly for clusters projected against the central parts of the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) . besides , interactions with the disc and the tidal pull of the galactic centre / bulge , as well as collisions with molecular clouds , tend to destroy poorly - populated ocs in a time - scale of a few @xmath28 ( @xcite ) , especially for centrally located ocs .",
    "although conceptually different , these effects combine to produce observable changes in cluster structural parameters . for the outer parts of poorly populated and centrally located ocs it is expected : _",
    "( i ) _ cluster expansion due to dynamical evolution ; _ ( ii ) _ decrease in cluster / background contrast especially for @xmath29 ; _ ( iii ) _ enhanced disruption rates .",
    "empirical determinations of cluster limiting radii depend critically on rdp and background levels ( and respective fluctuations ) .",
    "thus , effects _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ should affect more  than , since the latter is derived by fitting an analytical function to the distribution of points provided by the rdp , as indicated by model - cluster simulations ( sect .  [ simul ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", dynamical evolution may accelerate because of _ ( iii ) _",
    ", thus increasing the rate of large scale core - halo mass segregation and low - mass star evaporation to the field - effects that tend to increase intrinsic cluster size and decrease . since mass segregation drives preferentially low - mass stars to the outer parts of clusters , cluster / background contrast in these regions tends to lower as clusters age . as an observational consequence , smaller values of limiting radii",
    "should be measured , especially for clusters in dense fields .    to disentangle these effects",
    "we employ a set of parameters that probe structure and dynamical state derived for a sample of nearby ocs with ages in the range @xmath30myr and masses within @xmath31 , following most of the present methodology ( @xcite ) . to the original reference sample",
    "were added ngc6611 ( @xcite ) and ngc4755 ( @xcite ) .",
    "clusters are differentiated according to total mass ( smaller or larger than 1000 ) .",
    "the evolutionary parameter @xmath32 ( col .  12 of table  [ tab5 ] ) , where @xmath33 is the relaxation time ( @xcite ) , was found to be a good tracer of dynamical states . in particular ,",
    "significant flattening in cluster mf slopes due to dynamical effects such as mass segregation is expected to occur for @xmath34 .",
    "details on parameter correlation in the reference sample are given in @xcite .    in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] we compare core and limiting radii of the present ocs with those of the reference sample in terms of cluster age . in all cases ,",
    "both kinds of radii appear to be significantly smaller than those of nearby ocs of similar ages , especially in limiting radius . tr23 and tr26 have @xmath35 of those in the reference sample , while for the remaining ones @xmath36 . a similar effect occurs for galactocentric distances ( panels ( d ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "core and limiting radii in the reference sample are related by @xmath37 ( panel ( c ) ) , which suggests that both kinds of radii undergo a similar scaling , at least for @xmath38 and @xmath39 . except for cz37 and tr26",
    ", the remaining ocs do not follow that relation . considering that we may have underestimated  by 1020% ( sect .",
    "[ simul ] ) , this again suggests that the present ocs are either intrinsically small or have been suffering important evaporation effects .",
    "the dependence of  on evolutionary parameter @xmath40 ( panel ( f ) ) supports this conclusion , since except for tr23 , the remaining ocs have @xmath40 significantly larger than 7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "relations presented in the bottom panels of fig .  [ fig16 ] also indicate that we are dealing with ocs affected by tidal and low - contrast effects , especially in their outer parts .",
    "the relation of their ( total ) masses with core radii is consistent with that defined by nearby ocs ( panel ( g ) ) , in both mass regimes .",
    "mass density , on the other hand , that in the context of the present work is basically sensitive to limiting radius , seems to be exceedingly high with respect to nearby ocs . except for cz37 and tr26 ,",
    "the remaining ocs have a mass density @xmath41 times higher than that of nearby ocs .",
    "if mass values are reasonably well determined , as suggested by panel ( g ) , a factor of @xmath42 applied to their limiting radii would bring densities close to the typical values of nearby ocs .",
    "interestingly , this correction would as well put the deviant ocs back into the tight core and limiting radii relation ( panel ( c ) ) .",
    "even so , they would still have core and limiting radii smaller than those of nearby ocs , with @xmath43pc and @xmath44pc . considering the discussion presented in sect .",
    "[ simul ] , most of the smaller limiting radii can be accounted for by dynamical effects , both internal and external to the clusters .",
    "probably because of its innermost position in the galaxy ( table  [ tab1 ] ) and low mass ( table  [ tab5 ] ) , cz37 seems to be the oc most affected by tidal effects ( and accelerated dynamical evolution ) , since it shows the flattest mf slope ( panel ( i ) ) , smallest core radius and total mass in the present sample .",
    "low - contrast star clusters projected against central parts of the galaxy present a challenge to observational projects that intend to improve their census and derive fundamental and dynamical parameters .",
    "high background levels may not allow detection of the external parts of clusters , because of low - surface brightness .",
    "in many cases , it may not be possible to detect faint clusters above the background at all ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical predictions indicate that poorly - populated ocs must by far be the majority of the star cluster population in the galaxy .",
    "indeed , @xcite have found that the distribution function for the number of ocs with @xmath45 observed member stars ( considering all disc directions in the galaxy ) follows @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that the fraction of milky way ocs with @xmath47 observed member stars amounts to about 65% , while for @xmath48 it increases to @xmath49 .",
    "derivation of accurate fundamental and structural parameters of poorly - populated ocs , especially those inside the solar circle , is important as well to test models of cluster tidal disruption .    in the present work",
    "a set of tools was applied - e.g. fs decontamination , cm filter and diagnostic - diagrams for structure and dynamical state - to six ocs projected not far from the galactic center .",
    "the objects are ngc5715 , lyng4 , lyng9 , trumpler23 , trumpler26 and czernik37 , whose near - ir cmds are heavily contaminated by field stars , especially bulge ones . probably because of this",
    ", these objects could not previously be studied in detail .",
    "lyng9 , in particular , was considered to be a fluctuation of the dense field ( @xcite ) .",
    "we work with wide - field extractions of 2mass photometry .",
    "2mass field - star decontaminated and colour - magnitude filtered photometry produced compelling evidence - in terms of cmds with well - defined cluster sequences and stellar density profiles following king law - that the 6 objects are ocs about the hyades age ( @xmath50 ) located @xmath2kpc inside the solar circle . in all cases core , and especially limiting radii , appear to be smaller than those of nearby ocs outside the solar circle .",
    "we measured @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "simulations of king - like ocs have shown that high background levels may have affected limiting radius estimates for the present ocs , in the sense that  can be underestimated by about 1020% .",
    ", on the other hand , is almost insensitive to the range of background levels used in the simulations .",
    "thus , background contamination alone can not account for the small limiting radii measured in the present ocs , which are scaled down by factors of @xmath53 , as compared to a sample of nearby ocs .",
    "except for cz37 which has a flat mf , the remaining ocs have salpeter - like mfs , within uncertainties .",
    "mass stored in observed ms and evolved stars amounts to @xmath25 .",
    "total masses , estimated by extrapolation of the mfs to 0.08 , are in the range @xmath54 .",
    "however we point out that total mass estimates may be upper limits because of dynamical evolution effects .    with the help of diagnostic diagrams that probe structure and dynamical state of ocs",
    ", we find evidence that the 6 objects have been suffering significant tidal effects ( for ages older than @xmath55myr ) .",
    "such tidal effects may have accelerated their dynamical evolution , especially in czernik37 , the innermost oc of the present sample with a flat mf . large - scale mass segregation and low - mass star evaporation drive preferentially faint stars to large distances from the cluster centre . however , because dynamically - inflated cluster external regions end up having a low surface brightness , they tend to become indistinguishable from the background when projected against dense stellar fields . as an observational consequence of these effects , poorly - populated ocs projected against the central parts of the galaxy tend to have smaller limiting radii than those measured in similar ocs located at high galactic latitudes and/or far from the centre .",
    "arguments based only on observed cmd morphology may not be enough to establish the nature of objects in dense fields as star clusters .",
    "instead , the present work shows that stronger constraints are provided by fs - decontaminated cmds and the shape of cm - filtered rdps , especially when rdps of different magnitude domains present similar features . besides , with the quantitative tools we have been developing in this series of works , it is becoming feasible to explore faint ocs in dense stellar fields with 2mass photometry , provided care",
    "is taken to statistically identify probable member stars ( to better define cluster stellar sequences on cmds ) and exclude stars with discordant colours ( for more intrinsic cluster rdps and mfs ) .",
    "considering as well structure and dynamical state diagnostic - diagrams , it is becoming possible to disentangle high background levels from tidal effects in the outer parts of ocs .",
