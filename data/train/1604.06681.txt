    "the rate of a clock appeared around 1300 and has been used since then for hundreds of years .",
    "@xcite by moving the small weights on the foliot the rate of the clock could be tuned . to our modern eyes ,",
    "the main disadvantage of a foliot is that it is not a very accurate timekeeper .",
    "some 15 min./day ( @xmath6 ) is about what you get .",
    "but in those days not yet ridden by notions of speed and efficiency , that was adequate for most purposes .",
    "the physical reason for the low accuracy is that the verge plus foliot is a highly dissipative system . in each swing",
    "_ all _ the energy has to be fed anew into the foliot and taken out again by the driving mechanism and friction .",
    "the trouble is that it is difficult to make this supply and removal of energy sufficiently reproducible , whence sizeable variations and drifts in subsequent oscillation periods accumulate . from our modern perspective",
    ", it is easy to sigh ` if they had only mounted some kind of a spring on the foliot - that would have dramatically improved the timekeeping ' .",
    "yes , but that invention was only introduced in 1675 by huygens .",
    "horologists did try to improve the performance , and arguably the most accurate foliot - equipped clocks have been made by jost brgi ( 1552 - 1632 ) , clockmaker and astronomer employed by wilhelm iv landgrave of hesse - kassel .",
    "@xcite his extant clocks are a marvel to see , and the craftsmanship with which they have been constructed makes you think they come straight from a modern mechanical workshop .",
    "they attain an accuracy of better than 1 min./day ( @xmath7 ) according to ref .  , and represent the state of the art in horology around 1600 .",
    "in actual fact brgi used a double - foliot or cross - beat escapement , @xcite but for the present that is a detail .     exerted on the verge switches",
    "sign after each half period , at fixed values @xmath1 of the swing angle @xmath3 . adapted from fig .  1 of roup",
    "_ et al._@xcite , width=170 ]    the foliot remained the clockmaker s workhorse until well into the second half of the 17th century .",
    "after huygens 1657 invention it became obsolete and was gradually replaced by a pendulum where and when the need arose .",
    "the great idea of a pendulum is that you do nt supply and remove _ all _ the energy in each swing , but rather leave as much of it stored in the system as possible . in this way",
    "the pendulum is largely free in its motion ( at least much more so than a foliot ) , and the escapement only supplies the fraction of the energy that is lost by friction . and only insofar energy is resupplied will inaccuracies and variability creep in . that is , in a nutshell , why pendulum clocks keep time more accurately than verge - and - foliot clocks .",
    "theoretical investigations have been published by only a few authors .",
    "lepschy et al .",
    "@xcite analyze the verge and foliot as a two - body system whose parts are in continuous frictionless motion , interrupted by inelastic collisional impacts .",
    "roup et al .",
    "@xcite studied a comprehensive version of this model using impulsive differential equations .",
    "they determine under what conditions the system has a stable limit cycle and find that the period @xmath8 of the foliot scales as @xmath9 where @xmath2 is the driving torque .",
    "denny @xcite obtains the same scaling using a much simpler model .",
    "it is not clear to what extent this is a coincidence or a more general result , as neither paper investigates the origin of their @xmath9 scaling .    the dependence of @xmath8 on the parameters ( driving torque @xmath2 and friction coefficient @xmath10 ) is an interesting topic in its own right that , to our knowledge , has not been studied before .",
    "we therefore consider the dynamics of a foliot driven by a constant torque and friction proportional to angular velocity .",
    "we see this as a first step , and reserve other types of friction such as coulomb friction for a later study .",
    "we introduce a model escapement and analyse its operation theoretically in sec .",
    "[ sec : statsw ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : propsw ] we discuss the properties of the foliot and we review our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "the foliot rotates on the vertically suspended verge and experiences torques due to driving and friction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : folesc ] .",
    "the swing angle @xmath11 obeys the same differential equation as that of a pendulum , except that there is no restoring gravity torque : @xmath12 here @xmath10 is the friction coefficient ( dimension @xmath13=\\ $ ] s@xmath14 ) and @xmath15 the driving torque ( @xmath16=$ ] torque / moment of inertia of the foliot ) .",
    "the dot stands for the time - derivative : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc .",
    "the escapement delivers a driving torque @xmath19 that switches to the opposite sign @xmath20 after half a period @xmath21 ( we take @xmath22 ) .",
    "the switch is at fixed , mechanically determined angles @xmath23 . for convenience",
    "we assume that @xmath10 and @xmath2 do not depend on @xmath11 and @xmath24 .",
    "it seems plausible that the dynamics of the foliot on time scales of a period and longer are not very sensitive to the fine structure of @xmath25 , as in the case of a pendulum.@xcite hence , we adopt this simple @xmath0 flip - flop model .",
    "( [ eq : ddt1 ] ) can be further simplified by introducing a dimensionless time @xmath26 , and a normalised swing angle @xmath27 leading to @xmath28 with @xmath29 , etc .",
    "but the advantage is marginal and we mention eq .",
    "( [ eq : dimless ] ) only to illustrate why the normalised torque @xmath30 figures so prominently below .",
    "we choose @xmath31 where @xmath15 switches sign from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : samplephi ] , taking as initial conditions @xmath34 assuming that @xmath20 and that @xmath10 and @xmath2 do not depend on time , we may solve eq .",

    "we may also compute the swing amplitude @xmath47 and the period @xmath48 , and other desired quantities .",
    "we relegate the technicalities to appendix  [ sec : peramp ] , and restrict ourselves below to a discussion of the results .",
    "[ fig : samplephi ] shows the angle @xmath3 of a foliot in stationary swing for several driving torques . for weak",
    "driving ( @xmath49 ; top panel ) , the foliot moves slowly , at virtually constant speed @xmath50 , as inertia can be ignored in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddt1 ] ) , and there is hardly any overshoot at the turning points .",
    "so the period is approximately equal to @xmath51 , or in terms of the normalised torque @xmath30 : @xmath52 , in agreement with table  [ tab : asex ] .",
    "it may take ages to complete a period when @xmath2 is small , but there is no minimum torque .",
    "the foliot is always self - starting and the amplitude @xmath47 is always larger than @xmath53 .    for moderate driving ( middle panel ) , the swing angle overshoots @xmath53 , by about @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "the period has decreased significantly and @xmath3 has developped a noticeable asymmetry .",
    "this is due to the fact that when the swing angle @xmath11 reaches position @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig : samplephi]c , the foliot has traversed a longer acceleration traject ( @xmath57 ) than @xmath58 when it arrives in @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , the angular speed @xmath24 in @xmath56 is larger than in @xmath59 , and that makes that the peaks appear to ` recline ' . for strong driving ( @xmath60 ; bottom panel ) the period decreases further , and the overshoot is large .",
    "the peaks are also rounder than they would be for sinusoidal motion . fig .",
    "[ fig : samplephi ] illustrates that the motion of the foliot is neither harmonic , nor isochronous as the period depends on @xmath2 .",

    "we derive this @xmath5 scaling from a different angle .",
    "we may summarize our results for the scaling of the period @xmath8 with @xmath2 as follows : @xmath67 the period scales as @xmath68 for small @xmath2 , and changes gradually into @xmath5 as the driving gets strong . on the other hand , roup et al .",
    "@xcite and denny @xcite find @xmath69 , apparently for all @xmath2 .",
    "the origin of this difference remains to be investigated , and the fact that the type of friction is quite different must be an important factor .      as an example of how fig .  [",
    "fig : amperlab ] may be used we study the sensitivity of the period to variations in driving torque and friction .",
    "we make a local power law fit to the @xmath61 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : amperlab ] by writing @xmath70 . starting from @xmath71 and using @xmath72 and @xmath73 , plus a little algebra , we arrive at @xmath74",
    "hence , @xmath69 ( or @xmath75 ) seems to be a good operating point , as the period is then insensitive to variations in friction .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath30 is obtained by constructing the tangent to the @xmath61 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : amperlab ] with inclination @xmath76 . in this way",
    "we arrive at point @xmath77 at @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( these numbers were simply read from the figure ) .",
    "unfortunately , this feature is not enough to stabilize the rate of the foliot : driving torque variations @xmath81 ( always present as the foliot needs continuous driving ) , will according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : amusens ] ) necessarily generate a nonzero period variability @xmath82 .",
    "we conclude from eq .",
    "( [ eq : amusens ] ) that the @xmath83 timing accuracy quoted in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] requires a driving torque stability of @xmath84 when the driving is strong ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath85 for weak driving ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "in this model , strong driving makes a verge - and - foliot clock a more accurate time keeper ( less sensitive to driving torque variations ) than weak driving .",
    "the verge plus foliot escapement has received much less attention in the literature than the pendulum .",
    "this is unfortunate because the foliot poses an interesting problem in theoretical horology .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of a foliot performing a stationary swing , assuming a constant driving torque and friction proportional to angular speed .",
    "the merit of this model is that most of the analysis can be done analytically .",
    "the analysis is so straightforward that it seems surprising that it has not been done earlier . in part",
    ", the reason must be that by the time analyses of the kind presented here became possible , say around 1700 , the perfection of the foliot had long since been completed empirically by horologists such as jost brgi and his peers .",
    "so there never was a real need for it .",
    "we constructed the swing angle @xmath3 by smoothly pasting together pieces lasting half a period .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 has a characteristic asymmetry in that the peaks are ` leaning backwards . '",
    "we developed a method to compute the period @xmath8 and the amplitude @xmath62 numerically for given parameters .",
    "we find that the period of the foliot scales as @xmath4 for weak driving ( which is easily understood ) , slowly changing into @xmath86 for large @xmath2 . in this strong driving limit period and amplitude change rather slowly with the driving torque : a tenfold larger @xmath2 reduces the period by a factor @xmath87 and makes the amplitude a factor @xmath88 larger .",
    "the reason for assuming that @xmath10 and @xmath2 are constant is foremost the wish to keep things simple .",
    "we suspect that the time keeping properties of the foliot depend mainly on some average of @xmath15 and @xmath10 over a period , as in the case of a pendulum .",
    "@xcite to prove this for a verge - and - foliot escapement requires averaging the equation of motion ( [ eq : ddt1 ] ) over a period , which is not straightforward as the foliot has no well - determined period .",
    "so for now it is merely a plausible assumption .",
    "one should certainly question the idea of @xmath89 constant , in view of the sensitivity of the motion to variations in friction , in particular when @xmath2 and/or the angular speed @xmath24 are small .",
    "friction may change its type and switch to coulomb friction , for example .",
    "this in turn will affect the self - starting property .",
    "problems of this nature are best tackled with the help of numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddt1 ] ) with a variable friction @xmath10 and/or driving torque @xmath2 . that would help to develop a more complete picture of the behavior of the foliot under various circumstances .",

    "we obtain @xmath91 an alternative route to eq .",
