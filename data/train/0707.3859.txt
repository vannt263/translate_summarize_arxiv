    "quantum chromodynamics , the yang - mills local gauge field theory of @xmath5 color symmetry provides a fundamental description of hadron and nuclear physics in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "however , because of its strong coupling nature , it is difficult to find analytic solutions to qcd or to make precise predictions outside of its perturbative domain . an important goal is thus to find an initial approximation to qcd which is both analytically tractable and which can be systematically improved .",
    "for example , in quantum electrodynamics , the coulombic schrdinger and dirac equations provide quite accurate first approximations to atomic bound state problems , which can then be systematically improved using the bethe - salpeter formalism and correcting for quantum fluctuations , such as the lamb shift and vacuum polarization .",
    "one of the most significant theoretical advances in recent years has been the application of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite between string states defined on the 5-dimensional anti  de sitter ( ads ) space - time and conformal field theories in physical space - time .",
    "the essential principle underlying the ads / cft approach to conformal gauge theories is the isomorphism of the group of poincare and conformal transformations @xmath6 to the group of isometries of anti - de sitter space .",
    "the ads metric is @xmath7 which is invariant under scale changes of the coordinate in the fifth dimension @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ". thus one can match scale transformations of the theory in @xmath10 physical space - time to scale transformations in the fifth dimension @xmath0 .",
    "qcd is not itself a conformal theory ; however as we shall discuss , there are indications , both from theory and phenomenology , that the qcd coupling is slowly varying at small momentum transfer .",
    "thus in the domain where the qcd coupling is approximately constant and quark masses can be neglected , qcd resembles a conformal theory . as shown by polchinski and strassler  @xcite",
    ", one can simulate confinement by imposing boundary conditions in the holographic variable at @xmath11 .",
    "confinement can also be introduced by modifying the ads metric to mimic a confining potential .",
    "the resulting models , although _ ad hoc _ , provide a simple semi - classical approximation to qcd which has both constituent counting rule behavior at short distances and confinement at large distances .",
    "this simple approach , which has been described as a `` bottom - up '' approach , has been successful in obtaining general properties of scattering amplitudes of hadronic bound states at strong coupling  @xcite , the low - lying hadron spectra  @xcite , hadron couplings and chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , quark potentials in confining backgrounds  @xcite and a description of weak hadron decays  @xcite . geometry back - reaction in ads may also be relevant to the infrared physics  @xcite .",
    "the gauge theory / gravity duality also provides a convenient framework for the description of deep inelastic scattering structure functions at small @xmath12  @xcite , a unified description of hard and soft pomeron physics  @xcite and gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling  @xcite .",
    "recent applications to describe chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite and other meson and baryon properties , have also been carried out within the framework of a top - bottom approach to ads / cft using higher dimensional branes  @xcite .",
    "the ads / qcd correspondence is particularly relevant for the description of hadronic form factors , since it incorporates the connection between the twist of the hadron to the fall - off of its current matrix elements , as well as essential aspects of vector meson dominance .",
    "it also provides a convenient framework for analytically continuing the space - like results to the time - like region .",
    "recent applications to the form factors of mesons and nucleons  @xcite have followed from the original work described in  @xcite    a physical hadron in four - dimensional minkowski space has four - momentum @xmath13 and invariant mass given by @xmath14 .",
    "the physical states in ads@xmath15 space are represented by normalizable  string \" modes @xmath16 with plane waves along the poincar coordinates and a profile function @xmath17 along the holographic coordinate @xmath0 . for small-@xmath0 , @xmath18 scales as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the conformal dimension of the string state , the same dimension of the interpolating operator @xmath21 which creates a hadron out of the vacuum  @xcite , @xmath22 .",
    "the scale dependence of each string mode @xmath23 is thus determined by matching its behavior at @xmath24 with the dimension of the corresponding hadronic state at short distances @xmath25 .",
    "changes in length scale are mapped to evolution in the holographic variable @xmath0 .",
    "the string mode in @xmath0 thus represents the extension of the hadron wave function into the fifth dimension .",
    "there are also non - normalizable modes which are related to external currents : they propagate into the interior of ads space .",
    "as we shall discuss , there is a remarkable mapping between the ads description of hadrons and the hamiltonian formulation of qcd in physical space - time quantized on the light front .",
    "the light - front wavefunctions of bound states in qcd are relativistic and frame - independent generalizations of the familiar schrdinger wavefunctions of atomic physics , but they are determined at fixed light - cone time @xmath26the  front form \" advocated by dirac  rather than at fixed ordinary time @xmath27",
    ". an important feature of light - front quantization is the fact that it provides exact formulas to write down matrix elements as a sum of bilinear forms , which can be mapped into their ads / cft counterparts in the semi - classical approximation .",
    "one can thus obtain not only an accurate description of the hadron spectrum for light quarks , but also a remarkably simple but realistic model of the valence wavefunctions of mesons , baryons , and glueballs .",
    "in fact , we find an exact correspondence between the fifth - dimensional coordinate of anti - de sitter space @xmath0 and a specific impact variable @xmath1 in the light - front formalism which measures the separation of the constituents within the hadron in ordinary space - time . since @xmath28 in the front form , it corresponds to the transverse separation @xmath29 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath17 describing the hadronic state in @xmath30 can then be precisely mapped to the light - front wavefunctions @xmath31 of hadrons in physical space - time  @xcite , thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review in section ii recent evidence which indicates that qcd has near - conformal behavior in the infrared region .",
    "the qcd light - front fock representation is then briefly reviewed in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we derive the exact form of current matrix elements in the light - front formalism which sets the framework for the identification with the corresponding amplitudes in ads / cft , and constitutes the basis of the partonic interpretation of the ads / cft correspondence . the actual mapping to ads matrix elements",
    "is carried out in section v for the hard wall model and in section vi for the soft wall model , where the truncated space boundary conditions are replaced by a smooth cutoff .",
    "results for the pion form factor in the space and time - like regions and the pion charge radius @xmath32 are presented in section vii for both models . in section viii",
    "we compute the pion decay constant in light - front qcd and find its precise expression in ads , following the mapping discussed in sections v and vi .",
    "some final remarks are given in the conclusions in section ix .",
    "other technical aspects useful for the discussion of the article are given in the appendices .",
    "in particular we relate our results for the soft wall model to the analytical results found recently by grigoryan and radyushkin  @xcite .",
    "it was originally believed that the ads / cft mathematical correspondence could only be applied to strictly conformal theories , such as @xmath33 supersymmetric yang - mills gauge theory . in our approach",
    ", we will apply the gauge theory / gravity duality to the strong coupling regime of qcd where the coupling appears to be approximately constant .",
    "theoretical studies based on dyson - schwinger equation  @xcite and phenomenological  @xcite evidence is in fact accumulating that the qcd couplings defined from physical observables such as @xmath34 decay  @xcite become constant at small virtuality ; _ i.e. _ , effective charges develop an infrared fixed point in contradiction to the usual assumption of singular growth in the infrared .",
    "recent lattice gauge theory simulations  @xcite also indicate an infrared fixed point for qcd .",
    "the near - constant behavior of effective couplings thus suggests that qcd can be approximated as a conformal theory at relatively small momentum transfer .",
    "it is clear from a physical perspective that in a confining theory where gluons and quarks have an effective mass or maximal wavelength , all vacuum polarization corrections to the gluon self - energy must decouple at long wavelength ; thus an infrared fixed point appears to be a natural consequence of confinement .",
    "furthermore , if one considers a semi - classical approximation to qcd with massless quarks and without particle creation or absorption , then the resulting @xmath35 function is zero , the coupling is constant , and the approximate theory is scale and conformal invariant .    in the case of hard exclusive reactions",
    "@xcite , the virtuality of the gluons exchanged in the underlying qcd process is typically much less than the momentum transfer scale @xmath36 , since typically several gluons share the total momentum transfer .",
    "since the coupling is probed in the conformal window , this kinematic feature can explain why the measured proton dirac form factor scales as @xmath37 up to @xmath38 gev@xmath39  @xcite with little sign of the logarithmic running of the qcd coupling .",
    "thus conformal symmetry can be a useful first approximant even for physical qcd .",
    "conformal symmetry is broken in physical qcd by quantum effects and quark masses ; nevertheless , one can use conformal symmetry as a _ template _ , systematically correcting for its nonzero @xmath35 function as well as higher - twist effects .",
    "for example ,  commensurate scale relations \"  @xcite which relate qcd observables to each other , such as the generalized crewther relation  @xcite , have no renormalization scale or scheme ambiguity and retain a convergent perturbative structure which reflects the underlying conformal symmetry of the classical theory .",
    "in general , the scale is set such that one has the correct analytic behavior at the heavy particle thresholds  @xcite .",
    "analytic effective charges  @xcite such as the pinch scheme  @xcite also provide an important perspective for unifying the electroweak and strong couplings  @xcite .",
    "the light - front expansion of any hadronic system is constructed by quantizing quantum chromodynamics at fixed light - front time @xcite @xmath40 . in terms of the hadron four - momentum @xmath41 , @xmath42 , the light - front lorentz invariant hamiltonian for the composite system , @xmath43 , has eigenvalues given in terms of the eigenmass @xmath44 squared corresponding to the mass spectrum of the color - singlet states in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the momentum generators @xmath45 and @xmath46 are kinematical ; _ i.e. _ , they are independent of the interactions . the lf time evolution operator @xmath47 can be derived directly from the qcd lagrangian in the light - front gauge @xmath48 . in principle , the complete set of bound state and scattering eigensolutions of @xmath49 can be obtained by solving the light - front heisenberg equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an expansion in multi - particle fock eigenstates @xmath52 of the free light - front hamiltonian : @xmath53 . the lf heisenberg equation has in fact been solved for qcd@xmath54 and a number of other theories using the discretized light - cone quantization method  @xcite .",
    "the light - front gauge has the advantage that all gluon degrees of freedom have physical polarization and positive metric .",
    "in addition , orbital angular momentum has a simple physical interpretation in this representation .",
    "the light - front wavefunctions ( lfwfs ) @xmath31 provide a frame independent representation of a hadron , and relate the quark and gluon degrees of freedom with their asymptotic hadronic state .    given the light - front wavefunctions",
    "@xmath31 one can compute a large range of hadron observables .",
    "for example , the valence and sea quark and gluon distributions which are measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering are defined from the squares of the lfwfs summed over all fock states @xmath55 .",
    "form factors , exclusive weak transition amplitudes  @xcite such as @xmath56 , and the generalized parton distributions  @xcite measured in deeply virtual compton scattering are ( assuming the  handbag \" approximation ) overlaps of the initial and final lfwfs with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the gauge - invariant distribution amplitude @xmath59 defined from the integral over the transverse momenta @xmath60 of the valence ( smallest @xmath55 ) fock state provides a fundamental measure of the hadron at the amplitude level  @xcite ; they are the nonperturbative input to the factorized form of hard exclusive amplitudes and exclusive heavy hadron decays in perturbative qcd . the resulting distributions",
    "obey the dokshitzer - gribov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) and efremov - radyushkin - brodsky - lepage ( erbl ) evolution equations as a function of the maximal invariant mass , thus providing a physical factorization scheme  @xcite . in each case , the derived quantities satisfy the appropriate operator product expansions , sum rules , and evolution equations . at large @xmath12 where the struck quark is far - off shell , dglap evolution",

    "<S> the ads / cft correspondence between string theory in ads space and conformal field theories in physical space - time leads to an analytic , semi - classical model for strongly - coupled qcd which has scale invariance and dimensional counting at short distances and color confinement at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> the ads / cft correspondence also provides insights into the inherently non - perturbative aspects of qcd such as the orbital and radial spectra of hadrons and the form of hadronic wavefunctions . in particular , we show that there is an exact correspondence between the fifth - dimensional coordinate of anti  de sitter ( ads ) space @xmath0 and a specific light - front impact variable @xmath1 which measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron in ordinary space - time . </S>",
