    "however , if the information is encoded in terms of nonorthogonal quantum states , to copy or clone the information which arrives over a quantum channel is not possible without introducing errors . instead of obtaining perfect copies ,",
    "the idea of imperfect cloning was introduced by buzek and hillery who construct the first _ quantum cloning machine _ ( qcm)[2 ] .",
    "their work triggered an explosion in the number of investigations on quantum cloning .",
    "the fist qcm , which was introduced by buzek and hillery for qubit case , is now known as the symmetric @xmath0 universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) , a terms comes from the fact that it copies equally well all the pure state .",
    "the first study of non - universal or state - dependent symmetric @xmath0 cloning , which is to clone at best two arbitrary pure states of a qubit , has been given by bru _",
    "et al._[3 ] .",
    "the best - known example of state - dependent qcms are the so - called phase - covariant qcms , which are defined as the qcms that copy at best states whose bloch vector lies in the equator of the bloch sphere [ 4 ] . as an generalization of the phase - covariant cloning ,",
    "the problem of cloning to qubits , where the euler angle @xmath1 is specified and fixed , has been introduced by kairimipour and rezakhani [ 5 ] . for this case ,",
    "the optimal @xmath0 qcms were derived by fiursek [ 6 ] .",
    "recently , bartkiewicz _ et al . _ provided an optimal cloner for the qubits with known @xmath2 [ 7 ] . on contrary to the symmetric @xmath0 qcms , where the outputs have the same fidelities ,",
    "the asymmetric @xmath3 qcms could offer copies with different fidelity .",
    "for qubit case , niu and griffiths derived , in particular , the optimal asymmetric uqcm in their comprehensive study [ 8 ] . the same result was found independently by cerf who used an algebraic approach [ 9,10 ] .",
    "a quantum circuit approach was pursued by buzek , hillery and bendik [ 11 ] .",
    "our present work originates from the open question , which has been emphasized in the review article of scarani _ et al .",
    "_ [ 12 ] , that there is no general result concerning state - dependent cloning and the zoology of cases _ is a priori _ infinite .",
    "it is an interesting task for us to find a solution for this open problem . following the work of niu and griffiths in [ 8 ]",
    ", we shall investigate the problem , how to design the optimal quantum cloning machines ( qcms ) for qubit system , in the bloch - sphere representation . in stead of the quality factor there , the fiursek s optimal condition , where the optimal cloning machine should maximize a convex mixture of the average fidelity ,",
    "is used as the optimality criterion in present protocol .",
    "almost all of the known optimal qcms in previous works , the cloning for states with fixed polar angle , the phase - covariant cloning , the universal qcms , the cloning for two arbitrary pure states , and the mirror phase - covariant cloning , should be discussed in a systematic way .",
    "the known results , the optimal fidelities for various input ensembles according to different optimality criteria , are recovered here .",

    "the argument , how to choose the basis and express the pauli operators according to it , is given at the beginning of this section .",
