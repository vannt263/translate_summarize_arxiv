    "wilsonian momentum shell renormalization group ( rg ) schemes have become an important tool for the weak - coupling analysis of interacting electron systems because they provide a means to sum competing classes of diagrams in perturbation theory in a consistent manner .",
    "moreover , with the wilsonian rg schemes one can systematically approach potential singularities , which would cause problems in a direct perturbation expansion .",
    "successes of rg methods in interacting electron systems are for example clear arguments for the stability of the landau - fermi liquid in two and more spatial dimensions for short range repulsive interactions and non - nested fermi surfaces unless a kohn - luttinger instability intervenes at lowest temperatures @xcite , or the classification of ground states in quasi - one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , numerous one - loop rg calculations have been used recently to analyze the interplay between antiferromagnetic ( af ) and @xmath3-wave superconducting ( sc ) pairing tendencies in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hubbard model was originally introduced to describe ferromagnetism ( fm ) of itinerant electrons ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "the existence of spin ",
    "polarized ground states has been proven in one ",
    "dimensional @xcite and in special higher ",
    "dimensional @xcite models and also established in the limit of infinitely many dimensions @xcite . in the @xmath4 hubbard model on the 2d square lattice at weak to moderate @xmath5 , hartree  fock results @xcite , @xmath6-matrix approximation together with quantum montecarlo simulations @xcite and a generalized random phase approximation approach including local particle - particle correlations@xcite point towards a fm regime for larger absolute values of @xmath1 around the van hove filling where the fermi surface ( fs ) contains the saddle points at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "recent parquet calculations@xcite indicated similar tendencies .",
    "however , momentum ",
    "shell rg methods have up to now not produced any evidence confirming these findings .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a novel rg scheme , which we call the temperature  flow rg .",
    "its distinguishing feature is that the temperature itself plays the role of the flow parameter .",
    "indeed , it has been observed in many studies that varying a cutoff scale is in many ways similar to varying the temperature , but here we provide an exact rg flow equation for the one  particle  irreducible correlation functions , parameterized by the temperature . using this method , we show that in the one  loop approximation , one finds a ferromagnetic regime in the @xmath4 hubbard model .",
    "more precisely , the new flow is similar to previous ones for small @xmath1 and near to half  filling , but for larger @xmath9 , a ferromagnetic regime appears .",
    "the boundary of the fm phase is roughly at the same @xmath10 where it would be in the hartree ",
    "fock approximation , but with our rg calculation we find a _ quantum critical point _ separating the fm regime from a @xmath3-wave superconducting regime instead of a first order transition to an af phase as in hartree  fock .",
    "we also find a triplet superconducting state when the filling is increased above the van hove value .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the reasons why this fm phase was not seen in previous rg calculations .",
    "the main point is that when the flow parameter is given by an infrared cutoff , the particle  hole excitations with small total momentum are artificially suppressed above the scale set by the temperature , but in many interesting cases one can not run the flow down to these low scales because the one  loop rg flow of the interactions leads to strong coupling and even diverges at a nonzero scale .    in rg",
    "flows to strong coupling , the main interest is to determine the nature of the strongly coupled state .",
    "very often there are several candidates for the latter and it is natural to assume that the strong coupling state with the highest energy gain will be realized . in the rg treatment this state is typically associated with the dominant channel at the energy scale at which the rg flow diverges , e.g. determined through an analysis of the corresponding susceptibilities .",
    "however , one  loop flows become unreliable once the coupling constants get larger than a value which depends , among other factors , on the fermi surface .",
    "thus it can happen that the one  loop approximation breaks down before processes involving particle - hole fluctuations at small wave - vectors , which could drive ferromagnetism or screen longer  ranged interactions , can intervene . because of its inequivalent treatment of fm fluctuations on the one side and af and sc tendencies on the other side , this type of momentum shell rg with infrared cutoff does presumably not represent , at least when used too straightforwardly , an appropriate method to answer the question which of the channels prevails@xcite .    thus , although momentum shell schemes apply , and can even be controlled rigorously , as long as the running coupling constants do not get large , it is interesting to investigate and compare alternative schemes which are not based on strict infrared cutoffs and therefore capable of taking into account low ",
    "energy fluctuations at all wave - vectors in the same way .",
    "we now specifically discuss the stoner problem .",
    "consider an electron system with a density of states @xmath11 per spin orientation and a repulsive onsite interaction @xmath12 .",
    "the rpa spin susceptibility is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bare particle  hole bubble",
    "@xmath15 with @xmath16 the fermi distribution . sending @xmath17 and afterwards @xmath18 , we get @xmath19 where @xmath20 becomes the delta function as @xmath21 .",
    "if the density of states @xmath11 is continuous , we get , at @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the pole in this expression leads to the simple stoner criterion @xmath24 for a ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "of course , it is well known that the stoner criterion overestimates the tendency towards ferromagnetism , and one should include correlation effects .",
    "one of them is that in ( [ stonercrit ] ) , @xmath5 is expected to get replaced by an effective stoner coupling @xmath25 .",
    "this was first discussed in the so - called @xmath6-matrix approximation by kanamori@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath6matrix approximation also sums only a subclass of diagrams of one  loop type .",
    "thus the natural question arises whether by rg methods one could perform a consistent resummation of all one  loop contributions , to treat the ferromagnetic tendencies and the screening together with other possibly competing tendencies .",
    "let us attempt to apply a one - loop momentum - shell scheme to the stoner problem .",
    "the divergence of the uniform spin susceptibility is equivalent to a pole in the rpa perturbation series for the forward scattering amplitude @xmath26 which is obtained from the antisymmetric irreducible two - particle scattering vertex @xmath27 via @xmath28 \\label{aspin } \\\\ & = & \\lim_{\\vec{q } \\to 0 } \\left\\ { \\gamma^{(4 ) } \\left [   ( \\vec{k}+\\vec{q},s , \\vec{k}',s ) \\to ( \\vec{k},s , \\vec{k}'+\\vec{q},s )   \\right ] - \\gamma^{(4 ) } \\left [   ( \\vec{k}+\\vec{q},s , \\vec{k}',-s ) \\to ( \\vec{k},s , \\vec{k}'+\\vec{q},-s )   \\right ] \\right\\ } \\ , .   \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the @xmath18 particle - hole loop is the only diagram occuring in the rpa calculation of @xmath29 and also in the rpa calculation leading to the stoner criterion , we can limit the rg analysis to this channel , in complete analogy to cooper or sdw ( spin density wave ) instabilities , where the ladder summation of the zero - total - momentum particle - particle diagram or the particle - hole diagram with the appropriate momentum transfer , respectively , are written as solutions of the one - loop rg equation for the corresponding channel only ( as indicated above , we do a study taking into account all contributions below ) .",
    "the rg equation is then the differential equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is given by the integral for @xmath32 , but with the integrand containing an additional factor @xmath33 $ ] , with @xmath34 the cutoff function , say , @xmath35 for @xmath36 . in the limit of interest for fm , @xmath37 and ( [ quade ] )",

    "however , a closer look at ( [ scaled ] ) reveals that @xmath43 is negligibly small for all scales @xmath44 above @xmath45 because @xmath46 and the cutoff function @xmath47 restricts to @xmath48 .",
    "thus the contribution to the rpa is built up only at the very lowest scales of the flow : small-@xmath49 particle - hole fluctuations , such as ferromagnetic tendencies , occur only at low rg scales @xmath50@xcite .",
    "for the derivation of the rpa as a solution to an approximate rg , this is not a problem .",
    "but our goal is to understand the interplay of different instabilities , and it can happen that another instability driven by terms that contribute to the flow at higher scales gives rise to a flow to strong coupling at scales @xmath51",
    ". then the small-@xmath49 contributions would remain unintegrated because , as discussed above , we have to stop the one - loop scheme once the couplings cease to be small .",
    "this appears to be particularly unjustified if the density of states ( dos ) at the fs is much larger than the dos at higher band energies , e.g. in cases where the fs is close to a van hove singularity .",
    "one can argue that this problem is not only due to the one  loop approximation but that it also has to do with restricting to @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 is of order @xmath54 , the infrared cutoff does not suppress the particle ",
    "hole susceptibility any more .",
    "thus one problem is the nonuniformity in the buildup of the function of @xmath49 , and one might think that averaging over @xmath49 in a region of size @xmath55 may help .",
    "however , in this paper we attack the problem directly : as we shall show , in the temperature  flow rg scheme , the small @xmath49 fluctuations are properly taken into account directly , without further approximations like the averaging mentioned above .    in the next section",
    ", we set up the exact rg equation for the temperature  flow , and describe the one  loop approximation .",
    "after considering simple examples we apply the scheme to the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 repulsive hubbard model on the square lattice .",
    "this model is interesting because it supports a variety of fluctuations which can become singular at low temperatures and an unbiased treatment is highly desirable . on one hand",
    "it shows strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations due to partial nesting of the fermi surface at finite wavevectors and omnipresent superconducting instabilities at low temperatures are enhanced by the anisotropic scattering . on the other hand",
    "the 2d hubbard model is also a good candidate for a ferromagnetic ground state even at weak coupling because of the large density of states at the fermi surface for certain particle densities .",

    "comparing the temperature derivatives of ferromagnetic and superconducting susceptibilities when the leading couplings become larger than @xmath242 , the transition from the ferromagnetic to the @xmath109-wave superconducting regime occurs at a particle density of @xmath243 per site .",

    "we find that the flow to strong coupling is dominated by ferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "this regime has not been found with the momentum - shell schemes used recently@xcite for the reasons explained in the introduction .",

    "on the other hand in hartree - fock one would find a first order transition at @xmath10 , while in our treatment the characteristic temperature gets suppressed to zero at the quantum critical point .",

    "can be proved exactly . among those",
    ", the so - called flat band ferromagnetism appears to have the closest relation to the case of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model .",
    "the typical feature of these models is a large density of states at the bottom of the band which gets pushed further below the fermi energy by polarizing the system . in the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model for @xmath268 the density of states",

    "the fs appears to be essential for the fm tendencies in the @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model , as the latter are strongly reduced when one raises the fermi level above the van hove energy .",
    "moreover , if we cut out the bottom of the band by hand and discard all modes with @xmath269 , the ferromagnetic tendencies do increase rather than decrease , presumably due to the reduced screening of the onsite repulsion .",

    "the sensitivity of the ferromagnetic regime to the location of the fs points to another effect which is not included in the present calculation .",
    "it is probable that the inclusion of selfenergy effects in the flow will shift the fermi surface and alter the low energy density of states such that the actual ferromagnetic regime might be changed .",
    "a calculation of the selfenergy at the fs from the flow of the interactions shows however that the real part of the selfenergy becomes comparable to the temperature only when the couplings have grown larger than the bandwidth to @xmath270 .    in analogy with the interplay between af and @xmath3-wave fluctuations close to perfect nesting at smaller @xmath1 ,",

    "the energy gap suggested by the rg flow of the cooper pair scattering is highly anisotropic and exhibits minima on the fs parts close to the saddle points .",
    "similar scenarios have already been proposed by several authors@xcite , our approach allows a more systematic analysis of the crossover from the fm to @xmath109-wave regime and the possible order parameter symmetries . we note that the superconducting gap functions suggested by the rg flow @xmath271 are among the candidates under debate for the superconducting state of sr@xmath272ruo@xmath273 @xcite . in this quasi - two - dimensional system one of the three fermi surfaces has a similar shape as the cases studied above .",
    "it should be interesting to investigate the rg flow and the superconducting properties suggested by the resulting pair scattering in a more realistic three - band model .",
    "another future application of the modified rg scheme could be to investigate the interplay of screening of long - range forces with other tendencies .",
    "further , other potential instabilities in forward - scattering channel could be analyzed , e.g. labbe - friedel or pomeranchuk instabilities with spontaneous deformations of the fs , as proposed by halboth and metzner@xcite .",

    "<S> we derive a differential equation for the one  particle  irreducible vertex functions of interacting fermions as a function of the temperature . formally , these equations correspond to a wilsonian renormalization group ( rg ) scheme which uses the temperature as an explicit scale parameter . </S>",
    "<S> our novel method allows us to analyze the competition between superconducting and various magnetic fermi surface instabilities in the one  loop approximation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular this includes ferromagnetic fluctuations , which are difficult to treat on an equal footing in conventional wilsonian momentum space techniques . applying the scheme to the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the rg flow of the interactions at the van hove filling with varying next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> starting at @xmath2 we describe the evolution of the flow to strong coupling from an antiferromagnetic nesting regime over a @xmath3-wave regime at moderate @xmath1 to a ferromagnetic region at larger absolute values of @xmath1 . upon increasing the particle density in the latter regime </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic tendencies are cut off and the leading instability occurs in the triplet superconducting pairing channel . </S>"
