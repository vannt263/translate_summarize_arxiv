    "given a heegaard surface in a 3-manifold @xmath2 one can _ stabilize _ to obtain a splitting of higher genus by taking the connected sum with the genus one splitting of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , to understand the set of all splittings of @xmath2 one should begin with the unstabilized ones .",
    "when @xmath2 is obtained by gluing two other 3-manifolds , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , along their boundaries , then an important question is to determine the extent to which unstabilized splittings of @xmath0 and @xmath1 determine the unstabilized splittings of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in problem 3.91 of @xcite , cameron gordon conjectured that the connected sum of unstabilized heegaard splittings is unstabilized .",
    "this was proved by the author in @xcite , and by scharlemann and qiu in @xcite .    given heegaard splittings @xmath10 , schultens gave a construction of a heegaard splitting of @xmath2 , called their _ amalgamation _",
    "@xcite . using this terminology",
    ", we can phrase the higher genus analogue of gordon s conjecture :    [ c : isotopyconjecture ] let @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote compact , orientable , irreducible 3-manifolds with homeomorphic , incompressible boundary .",
    "let @xmath2 be the 3-manifold obtained from @xmath0 and @xmath1 by gluing their boundaries by some homeomorphism .",
    "let @xmath11 be an unstabilized heegaard splitting of @xmath7 .",
    "is the amalgamation of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath2 unstabilized ?    as stated ,",
    "schultens and weidmann have shown the answer to this question is no @xcite . in light of their examples",
    "we refine the question by adding the hypothesis that the gluing map between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is  sufficiently complicated , \" in some suitable sense .",
    "we will postpone a precise definition of this term to section [ s : barriersurfaces ] .",
    "however , throughout this paper it will be used in such a way so that if @xmath14 is a fixed homeomorphism , then for each anosov map @xmath15 , there exists an @xmath16 so that for each @xmath17 , @xmath18 is sufficiently complicated .",
    "unfortunately , the assumption that the gluing map of question [ c : isotopyconjecture ] is sufficiently complicated is still not a strong enough hypothesis to insure the answer is yes , as the following construction shows .",
    "if @xmath19 , then one can _ boundary - stabilize _ a heegaard splitting of @xmath2 by tubing a copy of a component of @xmath20 to it @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a manifold that has a boundary component @xmath3 , and an unstabilized heegaard splitting @xmath12 that has been obtained by boundary - stabilizing some other splitting along @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath21-primitive _ heegaard splitting ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such a heegaard splitting is unstabilized , but has the property that boundary - stabilizing it along @xmath3 produces a stabilized splitting .",
    "then no matter how we glue @xmath0 to @xmath1 along @xmath3 , the amalgamation of @xmath12 and @xmath13 will be stabilized .",
    "given this example , and those of schultens and weidmann , we deduce the following : in order for the answer to question [ c : isotopyconjecture ] to be yes , we would at least have to know that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are not stabilized , not boundary - stabilized , and that the gluing map is sufficiently complicated .",
    "our main result is that these hypotheses are enough to obtain the desired result :    * theorem [ t : highergenusgordon ] . * _ let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be compact , orientable , irreducible 3-manifolds with incompressible boundary , neither of which is an @xmath22-bundle .",

    "the first examples of minimal genus , distance one heegaard splittings were found by lustig and moriah in 1999 @xcite . since then the existence of non - minimal genus examples",
    "was expected , but a construction remained elusive .",
    "this is why moriah has called the search for such examples the  nemesis of heegaard splittings \" @xcite . in some sense",

    "[ c : moriah ] we produce manifolds that have an arbitrarily large number of such splittings .",

    "however , no matter how complicated @xmath6 is this may not be the case , as the following construction shows .",
