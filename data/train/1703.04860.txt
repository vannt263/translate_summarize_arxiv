    "the skyrme system @xcite is one of the most useful models in nuclear and particle physics due to its close relationship to low energy qcd @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the skyrme action is that it allows for the existence of solitons ( skyrmions ) that behave as fermionic degrees of freedom , in spite of the fact that the basic fields are scalar .",
    "furthermore , skyrmions describe nucleons both theoretically and phenomenologically ( see , e. g.,@xcite ) , where the identification of the winding number of the skyrmion with the baryon number in particle physics @xcite plays a crucial role . following @xcite , the possibility of treating the skyrme solitons as fermions was extended to curved spaces as well @xcite , opening the possibility for applying this theory to general relativity and astrophysics .",
    "the above reasons imply that the einstein - skyrme system might be relevant for astrophysics from a phenomenological point of view . from a more theoretical angle ,",
    "numerical computations following earlier results in @xcite indicate the existence of spherically symmetric black - hole solutions with a nontrivial skyrme field ( skyrme hair ) @xcite .",
    "these were the first counterexamples to the black hole no - hair conjecture , and , moreover , the stability against spherical linear perturbations was shown in @xcite .",
    "regular particle - like configurations @xcite and dynamical properties of the system have also been investigated numerically @xcite . even in the sector with vanishing topological charge",
    "the cosmological consequences of the skyrme model are quite interesting @xcite .",
    "thus , having analytic solutions of the einstein - skyrme system with nontrivial topological charges would be extremely useful .",
    "in particular , the gravitational implications of the discreteness of the topological charge together with the fact that such topological objects have a characteristic size , deserve an in - depth investigation .",
    "an especially compelling case is the time - dependent situation in which the coupling of the skyrme system with gravity could reveal unexpected departures from the  natural \" spherical symmetry of configurations with winding number @xmath3 .    at first glance ,",
    "the possibility of finding nontrivial analytic solutions of the einstein - skyrme system may seem hopeless . until a few years ago , no analytic solutions of the skyrme model in flat space had been found .",
    "quite recently , however , the generalized hedgehog ansatz ( introduced in @xcite and its generalizations in @xcite ) allowed for the construction of exact multi - skyrmion configurations as well as the first analytic gravitating skyrmions @xcite . moreover , these approaches also work in the yang - mills case @xcite**. * *    in @xcite , the full einstein - skyrme field equations , in the bianchi ix case and the @xmath3 sector , reduce to a system of two autonomous second order odes for two scale factors , where the skyrme field equations , which are usually the difficult part of the problem , are automatically satisfied in this ansatz .",
    "such a system allows addressing the question of whether or not the @xmath3 skyrmion which is known to be spherically symmetric in flat space retains this symmetry when coupled to gravity .",
    "a preliminary analysis in the reference @xcite suggests that the answer should depend on the value of the cosmological constant and not just on its sign .",
    "here we generalize the analysis of @xcite , confirming that the cosmological constant is one of the relevant parameters of the dynamical evolution .",
    "moreover , we also clarify in which sense the @xmath4 evolution of the system is  asymptotically \" spherically symmetric , that is ,  asymptotically isotropic \" .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the action integral for the einstein - skyrme model with cosmological constant is presented in section [ section2 ] where we introduce the self - gravitating skyrmion model in the background geometry of a locally rotational bianchi ix universe .",
    "the remaining equations are those of general relativity in which the energy momentum tensor is produced by the skyrmion . in section [ section3 ]",
    "the field equations are shown to describe a mechanical system of two degrees of freedom . in the limit",
    "in which the bianchi ix space - time is isotropic corresponding to an einstein - skyrme system with @xmath3 , the integrability of the ermakov - pinney system provides a solution , including a special solutions for the static einstein universe . in section [ isotro ]",
    "we analyze the stability of the isotropic @xmath3 solution by studying the first - order perturbations around it and show that it is not stable .",
    "however for a positive cosmological constant we show that the final universe is approximately isotropic .",

    "our result can also be seen as a generalization of the hedgehog ansatz discussed in @xcite , that allows for the construction of exact multi - skyrmion configurations composed by elementary spherically symmetric skyrmions with non - trivial winding number in four - dimensions @xcite .    on any three - dimensional constant time hypersurface ,",

    "the technical reason why this happens is that the scale factor @xmath59 and the squashing parameter @xmath60 depend only on time , while the skyrme ansatz depends only on the spatial coordinates .",
