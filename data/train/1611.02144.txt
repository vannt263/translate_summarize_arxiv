    "thermoelectricity provides a convenient way to convert waste heat into electric power .",
    "as thermoelectric systems do not require moving parts to operate , their reliability is higher than those of standard heat engines .",
    "though their efficiency remains limited @xcite , great efforts are made to improve their performances , focusing especially on nanoscale structures @xcite .",
    "evaluation of thermoelectric generators performance often boils down to the determination of a single quantity : the so - called thermoelectric figure of merit @xcite    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the average working temperature of the system , @xmath2 is the electrical resistance of the module , @xmath3 is its thermal conductance at vanishing electrical current , and @xmath4 is the global seebeck coefficient characterizing the thermoelectric coupling between the electrical current and the heat flux across the legs of the device .",
    "indeed , the theoretical maximum efficiency of a thermoelectric generator working between two thermal reservoirs at temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ( @xmath7 ) is directly linked to the figure of merit : @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the carnot efficiency .    yet ,",
    "accurate evaluation of @xmath10 is far from being straightforward , and various approaches may apply : one may measure @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , separately and then compute @xmath10 using eq .",
    "( [ zt ] ) .",
    "this method however proves quite inaccurate without great experimental care as each measurement error for each parameter contributes to the cumulated global error on the resulting value of @xmath10 @xcite . to overcome the unavoidable drawbacks of multiple measurements , harman suggested that @xmath10 might be determined by only measuring , under adiabatic conditions , the voltage across the sample resulting from alternating current ;",
    "this technique is known as the transient harman method @xcite .",
    "lisker later extended the idea of a single parameter measurement for different conditions : he proposed to measure electrical conductivity under adiabatic and isothermal conditions or , equivalently , to measure thermal conductivity under vanishing electrical current and short - circuit conditions @xcite .",
    "min and row suggested that @xmath10 might also be evaluated by measuring the temperature difference across the sample for short - circuit and open - circuit conditions if the incoming heat flows remain constant during the experiment @xcite .",
    "recently , the harman technique has been further improved using impedance spectroscopy analysis to lower uncertainties on @xmath10 @xcite . with this technique",
    ", the frequency dependence of the voltage across the system is analyzed and then compared to theoretical models . besides the determination of @xmath10 ,",
    "it is also possible to gain additional information on the material s thermoelectric properties @xcite . to evaluate the different characteristics of the sample , measurements are fitted to an equivalent electrical model . amongst the different proposed equivalent models",
    ", the simplest one corresponds to an rc electrical circuit @xcite .",
    "this latter was obtained empirically from measurements . in this article , we show how to associate this ac model with existing dc models for thermoelectric generators .",
    "it is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we first present the dc model for thermoelectric generators including non - ideal thermal contacts .",
    "we then extend this model to the frequency domain using small - signal modeling . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss our approach and compare our results to the literature stressing similarities and discrepancies with other models .",
    "we consider a thermoelectric generator connected through non - ideal thermal contacts to two thermal reservoirs at constant temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the wording `` thermal contacts '' implies all the parts of the actual system that conduct the heat flux including the heat exchangers , heat conductive paste , ceramic layers , and copper stripes . with no loss of generality",
    ", we then assume that the thermal contacts thus defined are characterized by a finite thermal conductance @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) on the hot ( resp .",
    "cold ) side .",
    "the electrical and thermal properties of this system in the dc regime are given by @xcite :    [ equations ] @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the voltage and the temperature difference across the generator and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the electrical current and the thermal current flowing through the device . to obtain the two above equations ,",
    "the thermal current is assumed to be constant along the device , which amounts to neglecting both joule heating and energy conversion . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , these two contributions indeed remain small in the generator regime as compared to the average thermal current .",
    "such hypothesis greatly simplifies the model as @xmath17 is then only composed of two distinct contributions : a convective heat current @xmath18 associated with the global displacement of the electrons @xcite and a conductive heat current @xmath19 associated with heat leaks .",
    "we assume that the three thermoelectric parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constant and that the system exchanges heat only with the thermal reservoirs .",
    "the global system is described on fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] . for completeness",
    ", the thermal capacitances of the thermoelectric generator , @xmath20 , and of the thermal contacts , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are also displayed even if they have no influence in the dc regime as they are then equivalent to a thermal open - circuit .        even if it might be suggested by its form , eq .",
    "( [ thevenin ] ) does not correspond to a genuine thvenin modeling of the thermoelectric generator since the electromotive force @xmath23 depends on the electrical current @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this point is stressed by the use of a controlled voltage source rather than an ideal voltage source in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "this dependence is due to the combined effects of the convective heat current and of the non - ideal thermal contact conductances : because of the thermal contacts , the temperature difference @xmath15 across the generator is different from the temperature difference between the thermal reservoirs @xmath24 , the latter being constant .",
    "since we assume constant heat current @xmath17 across the device , the thermal circuit might be seen as a thermal equivalent of a voltage divider and one then gets :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the equivalent thermal conductance of the contacts , given by @xmath27 . due to the conductive heat current ,",
    "a change on the electrical current @xmath16 thus has consequences on the temperature difference @xmath15 and hence on the electromotive force @xmath23 .",
    "it is then possible to obtain a genuine thvenin model of this thermoelectric generator distinguishing constant terms from terms depending on the electrical current @xmath16 .",
    "the voltage output thus reads    @xmath28    where the first term of the right hand side is the actual electromotive force @xcite .",
    "the additional resistive term stems from the introduction of the non - ideal thermal contacts .      to perform impedance spectroscopy measurement , a small ac voltage with sweeping frequency",
    "is applied using a lock - in to a circuit made of a sense resistor and of the thermoelectric generator ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the resulting ac current in the circuit @xmath29 and the voltage @xmath30 are both measured and then used to compute the complex impedance @xmath31 of the circuit : @xmath32    we make the standard assumption that each variable @xmath33 in the circuit may be defined as the sum of a continuous contribution and of a varying contribution at a frequency imposed by the lock - in :    @xmath34    with value of the dc component being set by the choice of the working conditions .",
    "hence , the impedance @xmath31 is related only to the ac part of each variable .",
    "the dc model may then be modified to keep only these contributions .",
    "to do so , and hence to obtain the small - signal electrical model of the circuit , one needs to shut down every non controlled dc source . in the model displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , the only non controlled dc source is encountered in the thermal part of the device .",
    "indeed , the constant temperature difference between the thermal reservoirs might be seen as a thermal potential source ( by analogy with a voltage source ) and consequently has to be replaced by a thermal short circuit between the thermal reservoirs ; this amounts to discarding the dc contribution to the temperature difference across the system @xcite . since in this case",
    "both thermal contact impedances are in series , one gets the schematic representation of the small signal model given in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "one may then notice that the complex impedance @xmath31 may be split into two distinct parts :        @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the electrical impedance stemming from the thermal part of the circuit , defined as :    @xmath37    the small temperature variation due to the varying electrical load is obtained from the thermal part of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "indeed , we see that the thermal admittance is given by :    @xmath38    in order to keep compact notations , we define the global thermal capacitance of the contacts as :    @xmath39    moreover , in order to reflect the asymmetry between the thermal contacts on the hot side and on the cold side , we introduce two contrast functions :    @xmath40    and    @xmath41    the former reflects the asymmetry on the thermal conductances while the latter reflects the asymmetry on the thermal capacitances .",
    "these two quantities thus vary between @xmath42 and @xmath43 and vanish for symmetric contacts .",
    "tedious but simple calculations lead to the following canonical expression for the complex impedance @xmath36 :    @xmath44    where the dc value @xmath45 of this complex impedance is given by    @xmath46    the characteristic angular frequencies are    @xmath47    and    @xmath48    and where the damping factor @xmath49 is given by :    @xmath50 .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ]    the total electrical impedance of the system might then be easily obtained combining eqs .",
    "( [ z ] ) and ( [ zth ] ) .",
    "interestingly , for symmetric contacts , i.e. , @xmath51 , eq .",
    "( [ zth ] ) is greatly simplified and the total electrical impedance @xmath31 becomes    @xmath52    where the characteristic angular frequency is    @xmath53    this simplification is particularly valuable since this situation is often encountered in practice ( e.g. , both ceramic plates surrounding commercial thermoelectric modules are identical ) . actually , eq .  ( [ zsimple ] )",
    "has even a broader validity than only symmetric situation since it also holds for the more general condition @xmath54 , i.e. , when the complex thermal impedance of the contact on the hot side is proportional to the complex thermal impedance of the contact on the cold side .",
    "it is possible to associate eq .",
    "( [ zsimple ] ) with a pure electrical circuit . in this case",
    ", the form of the characteristic frequency @xmath55 leads to the introduction of a so - called thermoelectric capacitance @xcite :    @xmath56    the equivalent electrical circuit is then a simple rc circuit given in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] .    ) .,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "it is striking that the thermoelectric resistance @xmath45 assumes a form similar to the additional term for the electrical resistance appearing in eq .",
    "( [ realthevenin ] ) , i.e. the thvenin expression for the dc voltage @xmath14 , due to the finite thermal contact conductances . for both ac and dc regimes ,",
    "this resistance stems from the modification of the electromotive force @xmath23 with the electrical current .",
    "indeed , with an increase of the electrical current , the thermal flux also increases because of the convective part of this latter .",
    "this leads to larger temperature difference between the thermal contacts .",
    "the temperature difference between the reservoirs @xmath24 being constant , the effective temperature difference applied across the thermoelectric legs is thus smaller .",
    "consequently , a higher electrical current results in a lower effective electromotive force @xmath58 : the electrical resistance @xmath45 reflects this detrimental effect .    when the frequency increases sufficiently , the additional thermal contribution @xmath36 to the total impedance vanishes . indeed ,",
    "in this case , the thermal contacts have no longer any influence : at high frequency , the thermal capacitances create a bypass for the heat current and impose @xmath59 .",
    "since this phenomenon is of pure thermal nature , the associated characteristic frequency @xmath55 only involves thermal properties [ see eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) ] .",
    "this thermal process leads to the appearance of the so - called thermoelectric capacitance @xmath57 in the equivalent electrical circuit .",
    "the typical value of this capacitance is about 1  f @xcite , which is several orders of magnitude higher than standard values for genuine electrical capacitances .",
    "the appearance of such capacitance and its surprisingly high value might however be explained referring to the thermoelectric convection : according to thomson , the seebeck coefficient might be related to the specific heat of each electrical carrier @xcite . since theses carriers transport at the same time heat and electrical charges , these two quantities",
    "are tightly coupled , which is as a matter of fact the footprint of thermoelectricity .",
    "it thus implies that evacuating electrical charges from a thermoelectric system is tightly linked to evacuating heat from this same system .",
    "hence , the thermal capacity of the system might limit the convective heat flow and so the electrical current : this behavior is typical of an electrical capacitance . moreover , since a thermal system has much higher time constant than an electrical system , the effective electrical capacitance constituted that way is larger than genuine electrical capacitances .",
    "there are several models to assess the frequency response of thermoelectric systems .",
    "the most basic model corresponds to an rc circuit obtained empirically @xcite . in this model equivalent to the one displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] , downey and coworkers also obtain a thermal contribution to the electrical impedance but they do not distinguish the contribution of thermal contacts from the contribution of the thermoelectric material . despite its simplicity ,",
    "this model is sufficient to describe the frequency response of commercial thermoelectric modules @xcite .",
    "however the rc model fails to describe less standard thermoelectric systems ; downey and coworkers thus make use of a thermal transmission line model accounting explicitly for the contacts to overcome this limitation",
    ". both models are equivalent for commercial modules @xcite .",
    "the possibility of distinguishing both thermal contacts in the thermal transmission line model offers similar features as the general expression given in eq .",
    "( [ zth ] ) . hence , with this equation , it is possible to recover the surprising diminution of @xmath60 below its high frequencies limit , i.e. , @xmath2 , for the single te leg of a p - type sample made of na@xmath61pb@xmath62sb@xmath63te@xmath64 studied in @xcite .",
    "more recently , de marchi and giaretto have also recovered a similar rc behavior for the thermal contribution to the electrical small signal impedance using a lumped parameters model @xcite . yet , contrary to downey and coworkers , they linked the characteristic angular frequency , designated as @xmath65 in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the thermal properties of the system .",
    "they found that @xmath66 .",
    "this expression should be compared to the characteristic angular frequency @xmath55 given in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) : de marchi and giaretto neglected in the derivation of @xmath65 both the thermal conductance of the contacts and the thermal capacitance of the thermoelectric element . these simplifications compared to eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) might however be justified as , on the one hand , adiabatic conditions at the edges of the system are assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to @xmath67 , and , on the other hand , the thermal capacitance of the active part of the module @xmath20 is about one order of magnitude lower than that of the thermal contacts @xmath68 for commercial thermoelectric modules ( see , e.g. , the example considered in ref .",
    "equation  ( [ omega ] ) thus is an extension of the result of de marchi and giaretto allowing relaxation of the adiabatic conditions during measurements used in previous studies , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . without such constrain ,",
    "it is then possible to envisage impedance spectroscopy as an appropriate technique to perform _ in - situ _ characterization of thermoelectric modules , including determination of the thermal contact quality .",
    "note that a method based on the dc contribution of @xmath45 has already been proposed to evaluate thermal contact conductances  @xcite .",
    "consideration of both capacitances @xmath20 and @xmath69 in the expression of the characteristic angular frequency also sheds light in recent results by garca - caadas and min . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the characteristic angular frequency is given by @xmath70 .",
    "the value for the thermal capacitance of the thermoelectric module extracted using that expression is about one order of magnitude larger than typical values for the material used in the module ( bi@xmath71te@xmath72 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is easily overcome if one uses eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) : the thermal capacitance obtained by garca - caadas and min is not @xmath20 alone but @xmath73 .",
    "as already stressed , for commercial thermoelectric module @xmath69 is about one order of magnitude larger than @xmath74 , so the high value obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is mainly due to the contribution of @xmath69 .",
    "while the simple expression of the electrical impedance @xmath75 obtained for the symmetric case , i.e. , eq .  ( [ zsimple ] ) , describes properly the main feature of the small signal electrical response of thermoelectric modules , it fails to explain the slight modification of the response at frequencies higher than @xmath55 observed experimentally in refs .",
    "this small discrepancy compared to the simple rc model is particularly visible on a nyquist plot where the half circle associated with eq .",
    "( [ zsimple ] ) is deformed on the left , leading de marchi and giaretto to coin the term `` porcupine diagram '' to designate this specific diagram  @xcite .",
    "according to these authors , this behavior stems from the different thermal responses of the electrical conductors used to connect the different legs of the module together and of the electrical insulator , typically a ceramic . in our model ,",
    "the thermal contacts encompass these two different layers .",
    "garca - caadas and min managed however to recover the `` snoot of the porcupine '' without distinguishing the two layers in the thermal contacts @xcite . while it is possible to reproduce such a diagram using eq .",
    "( [ zth ] ) , the associated values for the contrast functions seem quite unrealistic for commercial modules , i.e. , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the asymmetry of the contacts thus seems not to be responsible for the modification of the higher frequencies response . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this anomaly can not be evidenced with a global approach such as the one used in the present article : one needs to start from the local heat equation .",
    "we end this discussion with the frequency limitation of the model developed in the present article .",
    "the value of the different parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtained in the dynamical regime might differ from those in the continuous regime @xcite , these latter being the ones needed to evaluate performances .",
    "it is thus important to consider in practice sufficiently low frequencies to limit this discrepancy .",
    "for example , noticeable variations of the thermoelectric properties of @xmath78 appear above 1  mhz @xcite ; these are mainly due to the electrical properties of this material .",
    "it appears however that characteristic frequencies @xmath79 due to temperature fluctuations remain below 1  hz @xcite .",
    "the assumption of constant parameters regarding frequency thus is meaningful for analysis of impedance spectroscopy measurements .",
    "in this article , we introduced a small - signal model for thermoelectric generator . while recovering the form of the equivalent electrical impedance of the system empirically given by downey et coworkers @xcite , we derived this model on a physical basis , extending an existing dc model to the dynamical regime .",
    "this model is particularly appealing as it allows to consider non vanishing contact thermal conductance between the thermoelectric system and its environment : this constrain relaxation compared to previous models paves the way to in - situ characterization of such devices through impedance spectroscopy measurements .",
