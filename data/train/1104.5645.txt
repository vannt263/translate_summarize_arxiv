    "andreev - reflection spectroscopy at point contacts has been suggested as a versatile tool to determine the magnetic ( spin current ) polarization @xmath1 of ferromagnets @xcite . today",
    "it is widely believed that the polarization can be reliably extracted from the measured point - contact spectra by applying a modified version of the btk theory of andreev reflection @xcite , like strijkers @xcite or mazin s model @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been noted that the interpretation of these point - contact spectra presents extra difficulties because of spurious superposed anomalies and the poor convergence of the fitting procedure @xcite .",
    "andreev reflection across a ballistic contact between a normal metal and a superconductor requires the transfer of an electron pair with opposite momentum and spin from the normal conductor to form a cooper pair in the superconductor . in an equivalent description",
    "an electron is transferred to the superconductor and the corresponding hole is retro - reflected .",
    "this reduces the contact resistance by a factor of two for energies within the superconducting gap @xmath2 .",
    "normal reflection at the interface has a pronounced effect on the shape of the spectra because it enters the pair transfer twice by affecting the incident electron and also the retro - reflected hole , yielding the typical double - minimum structure of andreev reflection . to keep the number of adjustable parameters as small as possible , blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk @xcite described normal reflection by a @xmath3-function barrier of strength @xmath4 .",
    "the btk theory is well accepted to analyze the andreev - reflection spectra of ballistic contacts between bcs - type superconductors and non - magnetic normal metals .    since interfaces are usually not perfect , they cause additional scattering that can break up the cooper pairs and , thus , reduce the superconducting order parameter .",
    "dynes model describes this situation by a finite lifetime @xmath5 of the cooper pairs , which strongly reduces the magnitude of the andreev - reflection anomaly @xcite .",
    "a magnetically polarized metal has an unequal number of spin up and spin down electrons .",
    "conduction electrons that can not find their corresponding pair with opposite spin do not participate in andreev reflection , opening the way to directly measure the polarization @xcite .",
    "the polarization reduces the magnitude of the andreev - reflection anomaly like the lifetime effects , and it leads to a zero - bias maximum of the differential resistance similar to that of normal reflection . with few exceptions @xcite , the analysis of superconductor - ferromagnet spectra usually excludes lifetime effects so that @xmath1 and @xmath4 are the only main adjustable parameters .",
    "also the superconducting energy gap has to be treated as a variable , although its approximate value at the contact is known from the bulk superconducting properties .",
    "often a so - called broadening parameter is included to improve the fit quality by simulating an enhanced smearing of the fermi edge @xcite , but increasing the parameter number means the solution becomes more easily degenerate .",
    "we show here that the andreev - reflection spectra of both ferromagnets and non - magnets can be fitted equally well by assuming a magnetic polarization of the normal metal without lifetime effects and vice versa .",
    "this problem can be solved by taking into account the lower bound of @xmath4 due to fermi surface mismatch .",
    "our experiments are based on shear contacts between superconducting nb ( @xmath6k ) and normal conducting co and cu wires ( @xmath7 mm diameter ) at @xmath8k in liquid helium .",
    "co is a band - ferromagnet with @xmath9k and cu a non - magnetic normal metal @xcite .",
    "we have also re - analyzed older spear - anvil type experiments at @xmath10k with the bcs - type superconductor auin@xmath0 ( @xmath11k ) in contact with a cu wire @xcite .",
    "the differential resistance @xmath12 was measured as function of bias voltage @xmath13 with low - frequency current modulation in four - wire mode .",
    "spectra of ( a - c ) nb - co and ( d - f ) nb - cu contacts at 4.2k . ]",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows typical spectra of nb - co as well as nb - cu contacts .",
    "we have observed various types that can be classified as follows : @xmath14 andreev - reflection double minimum ( a , d ) , @xmath15 andreev reflection with side peaks ( b , e ) , @xmath16 single zero - bias minimum with or without side peaks ( c , f ) , and @xmath17 zero - bias maximum without signs of superconductivity ( not shown ) . for our analysis",
    "we have used only contacts of type @xmath14 and @xmath15 which show the hallmark of andreev reflection .",
    "the origin of the side peaks will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "contacts of type @xmath17 were studied earlier @xcite .",
    "we fitted the spectra in the conventional way using strijkers model and assuming @xmath18 ( figure [ fits ] ) .",
    "mazin s model would only slightly change the @xmath19 data @xcite .",
    "the resultant polarization of nb - co contacts in figure [ polgamma ] ( a ) agrees well with that found by others @xcite .",
    "however , analysing the nb - cu and the auin@xmath0 - cu spectra in the same way , assuming @xmath18 and allowing @xmath1 to vary , yielded almost the same @xmath19 as for the nb - co contacts ( figure [ polgamma ] ) : without advance knowledge that cu has zero spin polarization @xmath20 , we would be led to believe that it is actually polarized like ferromagnetic co. such a possibility was mentioned  but discarded  by chalsani _",
    "@xcite for pb - cu contacts .",
    "nevertheless , this speculation could be supported by recent experiments on the size - dependence of the so - called zero - bias anomaly which has been attributed to the spontaneous electron spin polarization at the point contact @xcite .",
    "( thin dashed lines ) and @xmath20 ( thin solid lines ) using the indicated fitting parameters .",
    "for all contacts the curves are almost indistinguishable .",
    "deviations found only near the shoulder where @xmath12 starts to drop from its normal - state value can be removed by introducing a broadening parameter. ( a ) nb - co at @xmath21k and @xmath22mev , ( b ) nb - cu at @xmath21k and @xmath23mev , and ( c ) auin@xmath0 - cu at @xmath24k and @xmath25ev . ]",
    "it appears trivial to assume @xmath26 for cu and to use the lifetime parameter @xmath27 that fits the observed spectra equally well . but",
    "the lifetime - only model also works well for ferromagnetic co , as demonstrated in figure [ fits ] where the theoretical curves for the two fitting procedures can be barely separated .     at @xmath18 and life - time broadening @xmath27 at @xmath26 versus @xmath4 of nb - co , nb - cu , and auin@xmath0 - cu contacts .",
    "the vertical solid lines represent the expected minimum @xmath28 due to fermi momentum mismatch in free - electron approximation .",
    "solid lines through the data points serve as guide to the eye . ]    in order to study the similarities and differences between the two models in more detail , we have calculated spectra at small , medium , and large values of @xmath4 together with their typical polarization as found in the experiments summarized in figure [ polgamma ] .",
    "these theoretical curves were then fitted with the lifetime - only model .",
    "figure [ models ] demonstrates the perfect agreement between the two models at large @xmath4 and small @xmath1 .",
    "this confirms earlier findings by chalsani _",
    "_ in the case of pb - cu and pb - co contacts @xcite .",
    "deviations become obvious only at small @xmath4 and large @xmath1 .",
    "note also that the strong @xmath4-dependence of @xmath1 turns into a @xmath27 at nearly constant @xmath4 , in agreement with the experimental data in figure [ polgamma ] .",
    "consequently , distinguishing lifetime effects from the magnetic polarization requires additional information .",
    "is normalized to the normal contact resistance @xmath29 .",
    "first the polarization - only spectra were calculated assuming the indicated @xmath1 and @xmath4 at @xmath30mev for niobium and @xmath31k .",
    "then the lifetime - only spectra were fitted , resulting in the indicated @xmath27 and @xmath4 . for this fitting the energy gap had to be slightly adjusted . ]",
    "this knowledge could be obtained from normal reflection : figure [ polgamma ] shows that the @xmath19 data are almost evenly distributed on the @xmath4 axis from @xmath32 to the maximum value of @xmath33 for nb - co and nb - cu contacts .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath34 data are centered at around @xmath33 , indicating a preferred value for normal reflection .",
    "this different behaviour must have a reason .",
    "@xmath4 consists of two parts , @xmath35 describes reflection at a possible interface tunneling barrier ( and any other mechanism that might be subsumed under this term ) , and @xmath28 due a mismatch of the fermi surfaces or band structures of the two electrodes . in free - electron approximation fermi surface mismatch reduces to a mismatch @xmath36 of fermi velocities @xmath37 on both sides of the contact and results in @xcite @xmath38 thus @xmath28 defines a lower bound of @xmath4 when a tunneling barrier is absent .",
    "that means , without tunneling barrier the @xmath4 parameter of the contacts for a given metal combination should be constant while a tunneling barrier would add a tail to the @xmath4 distribution at large values .",
    "the experimental data in figure [ polgamma ] indicate that our contacts either have a negligibly small @xmath28 plus an irreproducible tunneling barrier ( polarization - only model ) or a large @xmath28 with a negligibly small tunneling barrier ( lifetime - only model ) .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ z - parameter ] requires equal effective electron masses .",
    "for example , fermi velocity mismatch is negligible at interfaces between a heavy - fermion compound and a simple metal because their huge velocity mismatch of up to @xmath39 is compensated by the large mismatch of the effective electron masses @xcite .",
    "therefore it is more appropriate to speak of a momentum mismatch instead and replace the variable @xmath40 by the ratio of fermi wave numbers @xmath41 .    while we do not know whether our point contacts possess a tunneling barrier",
    ", it should be possible to predict @xmath28 from the known band structure of metals .",
    "this turns out to be quite difficult because there are different theoretical and experimental estimates for the fermi surface properties . in free - electron approximation @xmath42nm@xmath43 for cu and @xmath44nm@xmath43 for nb @xcite .",
    "auin@xmath0 has nearly the same conduction electron density as cu and , thus , a very similar @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "co has spin - split energy bands , and therefore different wave numbers for the two spin directions .",
    "its average fermi velocity @xmath46km / s is known from critical - current oscillations in josephson @xmath47-junctions @xcite .",
    "its effective electron mass @xmath48 is about twice the free electron mass @xcite , yielding @xmath49nm@xmath43 .",
    "the minimum @xmath4 parameters @xmath50 for auin@xmath0 - cu @xcite , @xmath51 for nb - cu , and @xmath52 for nb - co are consistent with the polarization - only and with the lifetime - only model for nb - cu and auin@xmath0-cu , but they clearly contradict the conventional polarization data of nb - co. on the other hand , nb is claimed @xcite to have a fermi velocity of only @xmath53km / s , based on critical field measurements , with a heat - capacity derived effective mass enhancement of about 2 . that would mean a perfect match between nb and co with @xmath54 .    quite different estimates for @xmath28 come from proximity - effect studies on nb - normal metal bi - layers @xcite with interface transparencies @xmath55 consistently smaller than 50% .",
    "since those bi - layers should have no ( oxide ) tunneling barrier , their fermi surface mismatch must be large with @xmath56 for non - magnetic normal metals cu , ag , al , and pd as well as for the ferromagnets fe and ni .",
    "the same is to be expected for nb - co interfaces @xcite .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with the standard interpretation of andreev - reflection spectroscopy of the ferromagnets - here lifetime effects would fit much better .",
    "if we assume that our nb - cu contacts are non - magnetic , then they deliver the normal reflection @xmath57 due to fermi surface mismatch in good agreement with the above mentioned proximity - effect data where a tunneling barrier can be excluded .",
    "the scattering @xmath58 around the average could result , for example , from small residual oxide barriers or the different crystallographic orientations of the polycrystalline electrodes when the contacts are formed .",
    "there is little reason to assume that nb - co contacts should have a much smaller fermi surface mismatch even down to @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath19 data points of nb - co at small @xmath4 are therefore invalid . shifting them to higher @xmath4 values",
    "requires the inclusion of lifetime effects , a quite natural consequence since we would expect the interface with ferromagnetic co not to be less pair breaking than the one with non - magnetic cu .",
    "however , without precise knowledge of @xmath4 it is difficult to extract any reliable value of the polarization .",
    "our data even show that the nb - co contacts could be non - magnetic like the nb - cu contacts .",
    "a small polarization at contacts with a large @xmath4 would be consistent with predictions of the conventional theory @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we can not exclude that nb - cu contacts are magnetic .",
    "the andreev - reflection spectra are consistent with a small local polarization of cu as has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have obtained similar andreev - reflection data for the ferromagnets fe and ni as well as the non - magnets ag and pt in contact with nb , indicating a rather general problem of andreev - reflection spectroscopy .",
    "the available information suggests that the true ( spin current ) polarization of the ferromagnets is probably not that derived from andreev - reflection spectra when lifetime effects are arbitrarily excluded and the intrinsic normal reflection due to fermi surface mismatch ignored ."
