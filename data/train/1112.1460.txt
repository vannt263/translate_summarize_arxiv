    "<S> often experimentalists study particulate samples that are nominally monodisperse . in reality </S>",
    "<S> many samples have a polydispersity of 4 - 10% . at the level of an individual particle , </S>",
    "<S> the consequences of this polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual particle size from images of a dense sample . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method to estimate individual particle radii from three - dimensional data of the particle positions . </S>",
    "<S> we validate our method by numerical simulations of four major systems : random close packing , colloidal gels , nominally monodisperse dense samples , and nominally binary dense samples . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply our method to experimental data from moderately concentrated colloidal suspensions observed with confocal microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that we can recover the full particle size distribution _ in situ_. </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we use our method to study the relationship between homogeneous colloidal crystal nucleation and particle sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that nucleation occurs in regions that are more monodisperse than average .    </S>",
    "<S> a wide variety of techniques exist for three - dimensional imaging of collections of particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these types of samples include granular materials , soil mechanics , and colloidal suspensions . </S>",
    "<S> our particular interest is in colloidal suspensions ; these have been successfully used as model systems for understanding phase transitions for several decades @xcite , and moreover are interesting in their own right due to industrial relevance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> confocal microscopy can be used to take three - dimensional images of fluorescent colloidal particles deep within a sample @xcite . when coupled with particle tracking techniques , </S>",
    "<S> the motion of thousands of individual colloidal particles can be followed over long periods of time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been used to investigate the colloidal glass transition @xcite , crystallization @xcite , colloidal gels @xcite , capillary waves @xcite , sedimentation @xcite , and a variety of other questions ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review ) . </S>",
    "<S> one advantage of confocal microscopy of colloids is that the data obtained are similar to what is found using simulations , which also provide the data of particle positions over long periods of time .    </S>",
    "<S> however , experimental samples are always polydisperse : even for a nominally single - component sample , the particles have a variety of sizes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is quantified by the polydispersity @xmath0 , defined as the standard deviation of particle radii divided by the mean radius . for many samples , @xmath1 @xcite . from numerical simulations , we know that the effects of the particle size distribution are not negligible . for example , crystal nucleation is difficult or impossible for more polydisperse samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal - liquid phase boundary depends on the polydispersity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity to volume fraction near the glass transition depends on the composition in nontrivial ways @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the influence of polydispersity on colloidal crystallization has been demonstrated @xcite , and there is also some understanding of how the particle size distribution influences the rheological behavior of a colloidal sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these are limited to studies of the spatially averaged properties of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> microscopy is useful for local properties , but particle size fluctuations of @xmath2 are not easily detectable </S>",
    "<S> . it would be desirable to know particle sizes for more direct comparison with simulations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in some cases , neglecting these sizes in an experiment can lead to wrong conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> one example is that the pair correlation function @xmath3 can show a qualitatively incorrect dependence on control parameters if the particle sizes are treated as all identical @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a second example is that the apparent compressibility of a random close packed sample depends qualitatively on whether individual particle sizes are taken into account @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a general method for using 3d data to determine the size of individual particles in any moderately concentrated sample , in general with volume fractions @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we use simulation data to verify that our method works well in a variety of sample types . </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate the utility of our method using previously published experimental data from confocal microscopy of colloids . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that colloidal crystal nucleation is sensitive to the local polydispersity : nucleation happens in locally monodisperse regions . </S>",
    "<S> our method is not limited to confocal microscopy and colloidal samples , but rather works with any data of the 3d positions of a collection of particles .    due to diffraction limits </S>",
    "<S> , it is difficult to directly determine the radii of individual particles from microscopy images to better than @xmath5  @xmath6 m @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> defining the edge is somewhat arbitrary and varies depending on particle properties and the details of the microscope illumination . </S>",
    "<S> other 3d imaging techniques have similar issues @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , it is much easier to calculate the mean radius @xmath7 of particles with a variety of techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , from the centers of particles , the separations between neighboring particles @xmath8 can be easily calculated . </S>",
    "<S> our estimation method for particle sizes uses only @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea of our method is that a large particle will be slightly farther from its neighbors and thus have larger values for its @xmath8 , and likewise a smaller particle will have smaller values of @xmath8 .    to start </S>",
    "<S> , we relate the pairwise separations @xmath8 as @xmath9 where particle @xmath10 is a nearest neighbor particle of particle @xmath11 , @xmath8 is the measured distance between @xmath11 and @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are their radii , and @xmath14 is a surface - to - surface distance between their particles . </S>",
    "<S> we typically consider @xmath15 nearest neighbor particles ( the closest neighbors ) ; this choice is justified below . </S>",
    "<S> often these data come from particle tracking @xcite and so @xmath16 and @xmath14 depend on time @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> next we take an average of @xmath8 with respect to the nearest neighbor particles @xmath10 , and then @xmath18 , where @xmath19 means an average over particle @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we obtain @xmath20 this is exact , but the quantities @xmath14 are unknown . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate this by replacing @xmath14 with its time- and particle - averaged value , the mean gap distance @xmath21 , where the average is over all particle pairs and all times . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm is then : @xmath22 where the superscripts denote iteration . </S>",
    "<S> the more we iterate eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3 ] , the more information we obtain from particles far away from a given particle . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath23 is unchanged for @xmath24 since @xmath25 includes the information from several thousand particles , thus we fix @xmath26 for the number of iterations in this paper . of course , the particle radius does not depend on time , so after the 10th iteration , we time - average @xmath27 to obtain the estimated particle radius @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> time - averaging after each iteration of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3 ] does not change the results .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several sources of uncertainty in this estimation . </S>",
    "<S> first , there is the uncertainty of each particle position . </S>",
    "<S> typically this is about 5 - 8% of the mean radius , leading to a 8 - 10% uncertainty of @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these errors are nearly time - independent , so those errors are greatly diminished by time averaging . </S>",
    "<S> second , our approximation for @xmath28 is weaker in the case that the distribution of @xmath14 is broad . </S>",
    "<S> this in part depends on how many nearest neighbor particles are chosen : more neighbors results in a broader distribution , whereas too few neighbors means that the average @xmath29 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3 ] is poor . </S>",
    "<S> below , we use simulation data to determine that @xmath30 nearest neighbors is an optimal choice . </S>",
    "<S> third , independent of a given choice of @xmath31 , some particles will simply be farther from their neighbors , and some will be closer . in a dense suspension , for example , this relates to the size of the `` cage '' formed by the nearest neighbor particles @xcite . again , time averaging helps . </S>",
    "<S> if particles can rearrange and find new neighbors , then @xmath28 becomes a better approximation for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> in dense colloidal suspensions with volume fractions @xmath33 , rearrangements become infrequent and so longer time averages are desired @xcite . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the greatest strength of our algorithm is time - averaging , and past that , a sensible choice for the number of nearest neighbors @xmath31 is useful . </S>",
    "<S> our tests show that time averaging over @xmath34 different times is sufficient for reasonable results .    to verify our radius estimation method , we simulate a variety of systems and compare the estimated radius of each particle with its true radius . </S>",
    "<S> the error is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath25 is the estimated value and @xmath12 is the true value . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 is the mean fractional error in the estimated particle radius . </S>",
    "<S> also relevant is the polydispersity @xmath0 of the simulated sample , defined as @xmath37 , where the averages are over all particles @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> before any estimation is applied , the best guess for each particle size is @xmath7 with a fractional uncertainty @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if the mean estimation error @xmath38 is less than @xmath0 , the estimation method improves our knowledge of the particle sizes ; we will show this is true for the simulated data .    </S>",
    "<S> our first test case is a random close packed sample . </S>",
    "<S> in such a sample particles do not move , and so time - averaging can not be used . </S>",
    "<S> however , particles are packed so that they contact each other , that is , @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of contacting neighbors varies from particle to particle , so it is not clear how many neighbors should be considered . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we plot @xmath38 as a function of @xmath31 in fig .  [ z - delta]_a_. we find that @xmath38 is a minimum at @xmath31 = 5 , and is indeed much smaller than @xmath0 ( 0.01 _ vs. _ 0.07 in this case ) .     on parameters . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) the uncertainty @xmath38 as a function of the chosen number of neighbors @xmath31 used for the averaging . </S>",
    "<S> the circles , triangles and squares correspond to @xmath38 for volume fractions @xmath40 = 0.51 , 0.56 , and 0.64 ( rcp ) , respectively . in each case , the sample polydispersity is @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath38 as a function of the bulk polydispersity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the circles and the triangles correspond to @xmath38 at rcp and @xmath40 = 0.51 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines are the fitting lines for @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> [ z - delta ] , width=302 ]    it is possible that while @xmath38 is small , that there are systematic errors depending on the real particle size @xmath12 . to test this , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ size - est]_a _ we show the ratio between the estimated radius and the given radius @xmath42 as a function of @xmath12 for a polydispersity @xmath41 rcp sample . </S>",
    "<S> the symbols and the error bars correspond to the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath42 between [ @xmath43 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 should be 1 if our estimation is perfect and indeed we find @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the results is nearly uniform as a function of particle size . to check the validity of our method for rcp samples with different polydispersity , we plot the uncertainty @xmath38 as a function of sample polydispersity @xmath0 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ z - delta]_b_. we find @xmath45 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a colloidal gel shares a similarity to a rcp sample ( touching particles ) , and has a significant difference ( much lower volume fraction ) . in a colloidal gel particles </S>",
    "<S> are stuck to their neighbors and form a large network . often the attractive interactions have a finite range , for example with depletion gels @xcite [ see discussion in _ methods _ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus we note that the distribution of @xmath46 for gels is slightly broader than that for rcp , though the mean average of @xmath46 is close to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> some time averaging is possible , although such samples are frequently nonergodic or at best rearrange quite slowly .    </S>",
    "<S> likewise the contacting particles make gels similar to rcp samples locally . </S>",
    "<S> however , the contact number fluctuates greatly in a colloidal gel , and the number of neighbors averaged over must vary from particle to particle . rather than being a fixed parameter @xmath31 , we have a varying number of neighbors @xmath47 used in the average ( eq .  [ eq:3 ] ) . to determine @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> , we define the coordination number @xmath48 as the number of particles within a distance 2.8@xmath49 , which is the first minimum of the pair correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> we find the average coordination number @xmath50 for a rcp sample , but this will generally be smaller for a gel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus for every particle we estimate the number of touching neighbors @xmath51 where we round @xmath47 to the nearest integer . in general , given the tenuous nature of a gel , for many particles @xmath47 is fairly small ; also , @xmath46 has a broader distribution , and so @xmath38 will be worse than the rcp case . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath38 is improved by time - averaging , which also minimizes the uncertainty due to particle tracking errors . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ size - est]_b _ shows the ratio between the time - averaged estimated radius and the given radius @xmath42 as a function of the true radius @xmath12 for the colloidal gel . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 is much smaller than the polydispersity @xmath41 .    moving from gels , we next consider a dense suspension of purely repulsive ( hard - sphere ) particles . here </S>",
    "<S> no particles are in contact , so @xmath46 has a much broader distribution ; however , time - averaging is even more powerful . </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath42 as a function of @xmath12 at @xmath54 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ size - est]_c _ , finding @xmath55 . yet </S>",
    "<S> again @xmath56 is much smaller than the polydispersity @xmath57 .     as a function of the true radius @xmath12 , for four simulated systems : ( a ) random close packing , ( b ) a colloidal gel at @xmath58 , ( c ) a nominally monodisperse suspension at @xmath54 , and ( d ) a nominally binary suspension at @xmath54 . for ( a - c ) , the polydispersities are @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> for the binary sample , the size ratio is @xmath59 , the number ratio is @xmath60 , and each species has an individual polydispersity of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars correspond to the standard deviation of of @xmath42 between @xmath12 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the insets show sketches of each system . </S>",
    "<S> [ size - est ] , width=302 ]    for a dense suspension it is not obvious how many nearest neighbors should be used in the average ( eq .  [ eq:3 ] ) , so we plot @xmath63 as a function of @xmath31 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ z - delta]_a _ for two different volume fractions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is minimized at @xmath64 for the non - rcp samples ( circles and triangles in the figure ) , so we fix our choice @xmath65 for all our @xmath66 experimental data ( discussed below ) </S>",
    "<S> . figure  [ z - delta]_a _ demonstrates that @xmath38 does not depend too sensitively on this choice . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be expected that for a more dilute system , the importance of caging decreases , and the number of neighbors a particle has will fluctuate significantly . for fixed polydispersity @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that for @xmath71 , the estimation method may not be useful without further modifications .    to check the influence of the sample polydispersity at fixed @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> , we vary @xmath0 with results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ z - delta]_b _ ( triangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath73 , suggesting that the estimation is useful for samples with @xmath74 , that is , any realistic sample . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is nonzero when @xmath75 , in contrast to the rcp case . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the distribution of @xmath46 in a dense but non - contacting sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the last case we examine with simulation data is a nominally binary sample . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate a dense suspension composed of particles with a size ratio 1:1.3 ( mean sizes 0.877 and 1.14 ) and number ratio @xmath60 . for both `` small '' and `` large '' particles </S>",
    "<S> , there is a polydispersity @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ size - est]_d _ , and we find @xmath76 at @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here we have fixed @xmath65 . ) </S>",
    "<S> again , there is no strong dependence on the true particle size @xmath12 , and in particular the particles in the tails of the distributions are estimated with good accuracy </S>",
    "<S> . however , the uncertainty @xmath63 for the binary mixture is larger than what is found for the nominally monodisperse distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the overall polydispersity of the sample being larger , @xmath77 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( triangles ) for a simulated nominally monodisperse sample with @xmath72 and polydispersity @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the distribution of the true radius ( solid lines ) and the estimated radius @xmath25 ( triangles ) for a simulated nominally binary sample with @xmath72 ; see text for more details . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , for five volume fractions as indicated . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is a gaussian fit to the combined data , giving @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) the radii distributions for the nominally binary experimental suspension from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for four volume fractions as indicated . </S>",
    "<S> here the solid line is a fit to the sum of two gaussians . with the size ratio ( 1:1.3 ) and the polydispersity of each species ( @xmath79 for the small species , @xmath80 for the large species ) , the two sub - distributions have substantial overlap . </S>",
    "<S> [ distribution ] , width=302 ]    an important use of the estimation technique is to measure the particle size distribution of a sample _ in situ _ ; we wish to validate this idea with the simulation data . to do this , we compare the estimated radius distribution @xmath81 with the true radius distribution @xmath82 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ distribution]_a , b_. in both the nominally monodisperse sample and the nominally binary sample , the estimated distribution ( symbols ) is quite close to the true distribution ( lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the estimated distribution is essentially reproduced by convolving the true distribution with a gaussian of width @xmath38 . for a single - species sample with a gaussian distribution of radii with polydispersity @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the estimated polydispersity would be @xmath83 . given that for most situations we have shown @xmath84 , our technique will only slightly increase the apparent polydispersity of a sample .    </S>",
    "<S> one key difference between simulations and experiments is the boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations have periodic boundaries . in an experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we can not find all nearest neighbors of a particle when the particle is located at the edges of an image . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is similar to colloidal gels , where the number of nearest neighbors varies for each particle , and we adopt the same solution used there . for each particle , </S>",
    "<S> we average over a number of nearest neighbors given by @xmath85 , where @xmath48 is the observed coordination number defined before , and we round @xmath47 to the nearest integer . the denominator 13 is chosen as the number of neighbors in a close - packed sample , and the numerator 7 is from the results of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ z - delta]_a_.    furthermore , we need one more improvement when we apply our method to a nominally binary sample . </S>",
    "<S> it usually happens that we know the mean radii of each of the two species , while the number ratio of two species is unknown , which means that @xmath7 is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , we start with a reasonable guess for @xmath86 to be used in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> then we compute the particle radii and obtain the double peak distribution which depends on our guess @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> both peak radii of the trial estimated radius distribution should be shifted by @xmath87 from the known mean radii . </S>",
    "<S> thus we subtract @xmath88 to adjust the peak positions to the known mean radius of each species and we obtain the estimated particle size .    in an experiment </S>",
    "<S> we do not have an alternate means to determine each particle size and so can not directly verify our results in the way that the simulations allow . </S>",
    "<S> however , evidence that our method works is shown in fig .  [ distribution]_c , d_. here , we analyzed previously published experimental data from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( nominally monodisperse ) and ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( nominally binary ) . in each case , data from several different volume fractions are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the size distributions agree well for the different volume fractions for both the monodisperse and binary cases . </S>",
    "<S> each different volume fraction was a sample taken from the same stock jar and therefore should have the same size distribution , so this is a confirmation that our method works well with experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by studying colloidal crystal nucleation . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleation of crystals in a dense particle suspension depends sensitively on polydispersity @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we compute the number fraction of the sample that is crystallized , @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ xtal]_a _ shows @xmath93 as a function of both individual particle size and time , where darker colors correspond to larger values of @xmath93 . below @xmath94  s , @xmath95 for all @xmath49 , and essentially all crystal clusters are below the critical size ( @xmath96 particles ) @xcite . at @xmath97  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath98 increases first for particles with @xmath49 close to the mean radius , and these particles continue to be the subpopulation that is the most crystallized at any given time . at longer times the particles with @xmath49 farther from @xmath7 gradually begin to crystallize .    </S>",
    "<S> we next consider an alternate way of thinking about the same data . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ xtal]_b _ shows the relationship between the sample - averaged @xmath93 ( solid black line ) , the polydispersity @xmath99 for all crystalline particles ( blue circles ) , and the polydispersity @xmath100 for all non - crystalline particles ( green squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath98 starts to increase at @xmath97  s , and those particles that are crystalline at that time have @xmath101 , smaller than the bulk polydispersity @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> as the sample crystallizes we observe that both @xmath99 and @xmath100 increase . </S>",
