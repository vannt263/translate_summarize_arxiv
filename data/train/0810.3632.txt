    "the standard model of particle physics has proved remarkable successful in explaining the behavior of particles thus far observed in high energy physics experiments .",
    "however , the standard model requires significant fine tuning to explain why the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is so much less than the gut scale .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) theory provides a natural explanation for this by proposing a supersymmetric parter for each standard model particle . in the minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "there are hundreds of free parameters , so the searches described below set limits on specific models with some parameters held fixed .",
    "these searches are for charginos , @xmath0 , which are linear combinations of the susy partners of the @xmath1 and charged higgs , and neutralinos , @xmath2,which are linear combinations of the susy partners of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and neutral higgs bosons .",
    "r - parity conservation is assumed , so that the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "@xcite in minimal supergravity ( msugra ) models , the only free parameters are `` the scalar mass parameter @xmath5 , the gaugino mass parameter @xmath6 , the trilinear coupling @xmath7 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectations values , @xmath8 , and the sign ofthe supersymmetric higgs mass parameter , @xmath9 . ''",
    "@xcite in gauge - mediated symmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models , chiral messenger particles mediate the symmetry breaking , leading to the free parameters in the theory being @xmath10 , the number of messengers , @xmath11 , the masses of those messengers , @xmath12 , the apparent scale of the symmetry breaking at low energy , @xmath13 which sets the mass for the gravitino ( the lsp in gmsb ) , the sign of @xmath9 , and @xmath8 .",
    "minimal models set @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "`` the d  detector @xcite contains tracking , calorimeter and muon subdetector systems .",
    "silicon microstrip tracking detectors ( smt ) near the interaction point cover pseudorapidity @xmath15 to provide tracking and vertexing information .",
    "the central fiber tracker ( cft ) surrounds the smt , providing coverage to about ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the cft has eight concentric cylindrical layers of overlapped scintillating fibers providing axial and stereo ( @xmath17 ) measurements .",
    "a 2 t solenoid surrounds these tracking detectors .",
    "three uranium - liquid argon calorimeters measure particle energies .",
    "the central calorimeter ( cc ) covers @xmath18 , and two end calorimeters ( ec ) extend coverage to about @xmath19 . the calorimeter is highly segmented along the particle direction , with four electromagnetic ( em ) and for to five hadronic sections , and transvers to the particle direction with typically @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the calorimeters are supplemented with central and forward scintillating strip preshower detectors ( cps and fps ) located in front of the cc and ec .",
    "muons are measured just outside the calorimeters , and twice more outside the 1.8 t iron toroidal magnets , over the range @xmath22 .",
    "scintillators surrounding the exiting beams allow determination of the luminosity .",
    "a three level trigger system selects events for data logging at about 100 hz . ''",
    "the di-@xmath4 plus missing transverse energy ( met ) search is optimized for gmsb  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that r - parity is conserved and that the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is the neutral chargino .",
    "the nlsp is pair produced , and decays to a photon and a stable gravitino that escapes the detector undetected , showing up as missing energy .",
    "the data used in this search was taken during run iia of d  and has an integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb@xmath23 .",
    "there are three potential sources of background in this search .",
    "first , there are events with real di - photons and met , which primarily consists of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the lepton is lost or mis - identified .",
    "the next source is events with real met and a one or two fake photons .",
    "these events are mostly @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the electron and or jet fake the photon .",
    "the last source of background is events with fake met , which consists of qcd di - photon and di - jet events where the energy is mismeasured and the jets fake photons .",
    "we look for photons only in the cc .",
    "they must have a narrow energy deposition with 96% of their energy within the em calorimeter .",
    "the probability of a track from the cft matching the photon must be less than 0.001 , and only @xmath4 with an @xmath28 gev are considered .",
    "also , the photon must be isolated in both the tracker and the calorimeter .",
    "the anti - track match cut is enhanced by looking for hits in the cft where a track would have been expected to pass if the em cluster were due to an electron .",
    "doing so effectively improves the electron tracking efficiency from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "one major innovation used in this analysis is that hits in the cps detector are matched to the photon em cluster and used to extrapolate the z position of the photon at the beamspot .",
    "this is important because the cps has a much finer resolution than the em calorimeter , so the pointing is much more precise .",
    "the @xmath31 resolution at the beamline for a cps matched photon has been found to be 2.3 cm from @xmath32 data .",
    "this analysis requires that at least one of the 2 photons have a cps hit , and imposes a vertex cut between the primary vertex of the event and the photon of @xmath33 cm for events with one cps matched photon and @xmath34 cm with two cps matched photons .",
    "this improves the met resolution , and reduces the number of events where the 2 photons come from different vertices .",

    "the @xmath26 and @xmath39 fake rates are measured by finding @xmath40 events in data and multiplying by @xmath41 , where here @xmath42 is the efficiency for reconstructing and matching the electron s track to the electron s calorimeter stub .    the backgrounds with fake met are determined using two different methods .",
    "the first method is to reverse some of the quality cuts on the photons , resulting in a sample of jets that are very similar to photons .",
    "the other method is to look at met in @xmath43 events , as no real met is expected in these events and the energy deposition of the electrons is similar to that of photons .",
    "the met distribution produced via the two methods agrees within errors .",
    "the fake met background is normalized to the signal by scaling the met distributions at @xmath44 gev to match that of the good di-@xmath4 distribution below 12 gev .",
    "comparison of the met distribution from data and expected backgrounds is shown in figure  [ gmsbmet ] .",
    "there is no indication of an excess at large met that would indicate a gmsb signal .",
    "for the purpose of setting limits , we generate mc based on gmsb snowmass slope 8  @xcite , with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . in this scenario , we set a limit on the scale of susy symmetry breaking , @xmath49 at the 95% cl .",
    "this corresponds to a limit on the chargino mass of 229 gev and neutralino mass of 125 gev in this scenario at the 95% cl .",
    "the limit is plotted against the snowmass slope in figure  [ gmsbmet ] .",
    "the trilepton susy search is optimized to look for mssm .",
    "r - parity conservation is assumed , and the neutralino @xmath50 is assumed to be the lsp .",
    "this search looks for the decays of weakly produced @xmath51 @xmath52 pairs to three leptons plus met , as shown in figure  [ feyndiag ] .",
    "three trilepton search channels are described here : @xmath53",
    "@xcite , @xmath54  @xcite , and @xmath55  @xcite . a fourth search not detailed here , @xmath56",
    "@xcite , is designed to fills in the gap in phase space where the mass difference between the lightest slepton and chargino masses is so small that the third lepton is too soft to be found at d .",
    "electron i d for the trilepton search is similar to that of @xmath4 i d in the gmsb search detailed above , except that a track match is required .",
    "the muon i d requires a track in the cft that is isolated in both the tracker and calorimeter and matched to a hit in the muon chambers . in each analysis ,",
    "the third lepton is a track that is isolated in both the tracker and the calorimeter .",
    "this track must have at least 17 smt+cft hits or at least 14 cft hits .",
    "backgrounds for this analysis come from vector boson plus fake lepton events , diboson events , top pair production , upsilon to dilepton decays , and qcd multijet events with the jets faking leptons .",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are modeled using pythia+alpgen mc .",
    "the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 backgrounds are modeled with pythia .",
    "the qcd multijet backgrounds are modeled by reversing some of the lepton quality cuts in data .",
    "the susy signal is generated with version 6.319 of pythia .",
    "the optimization is done using the 3 lepton max scenario , where the mass difference between the second neutralino and lightest slepton is small enough to disfavor the decay of the @xmath67 to anything other than an @xmath68 or @xmath9 .",
    "we use susy parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath46 .",
    "susy points are generated for chargino masses between 98 and 150 gev .",
    "the @xmath53 analysis places the following cuts on its events .",
    "the objects must all come from the same vertex and have a @xmath71 between them .",
    "there are @xmath72 cuts of 12 , 8 , and 4 gev on the leading and second electron and isolated track , respectively",
    ". to remove @xmath3 events , the invariant mass of the @xmath73 must be between 18 and 60 gev/@xmath74 , the mass of the @xmath75 must be less than 60 gev/@xmath74 , and @xmath76",
    ". the met must be greater than 22 gev and the significance of the met must be more than 8.0 .",
    "met significance is defined as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the component of the error on the jet energy which is parallel to the met .",
    "the transverse mass of the lead electron plus met must be more than 20 gev , and if @xmath79 gev , the @xmath80 track must have a @xmath81 7 gev to cut out @xmath1 plus track background . to remove @xmath65 background , we require @xmath82 , the scalar sum of the @xmath83 of all jets in the event , to be less than 80 gev .",
    "lastly , a @xmath84 to get rid of remaining backgrounds .",
    "no candidate events survive the final cut .",
    "the cuts for the @xmath54 final state are similar to those of the @xmath58 final state .",
    "there is an additional @xmath72 balance cut of @xmath85 , as for this variable @xmath62 is close to 0 and qcd and z backgrounds are generally more than 3 .",
    "the @xmath86 cut is set to 150 gev@xmath87 , resulting in 2 events surviving all cuts . in the @xmath57 final state , we require met @xmath88 gev with a significance of 8.0 . the lower of the transverse mass of the @xmath68 or @xmath9 and the met must be between 20 and 90 to remove both events with poorly measured met and some @xmath61 background .",
    "there is a significant background from @xmath1 plus track events , so the @xmath72 of the @xmath80 must be greater than 7 gev if the transverse mass of the track plus met is between 60 and 90 gev . finally , to remove @xmath62 background , we place an invariant mass cut of between 5 and 70 gev on the @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this final cut removes all remaining events so that no candidates were found .",
