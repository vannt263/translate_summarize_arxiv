    "most of the e+a galaxies present mid- to early - type morphologies , as it was already shown by some authors ( [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] ) .",
    "a little fraction of them have late hubble types ( but see [ 3 ] ) .",
    "however , their spectra is peculiar : they do not have emission lines , representative of an ongoing star formation , but they have strong balmer absorption lines , representative of a young population ( a and b spectral types ) , and also strong mg b @xmath6 , ca h & k @xmath7 , @xmath8 and fe @xmath9 lines , indicating that they have a rich population of g , k and m spectral types .",
    "this young population suggests that the e+a galaxies are 1 gyr to 4 gyr old .",
    "are there other peculiar signatures in the spectra of the e+a galaxies ?",
    "in particular , are their late - type star populations and their agb population also different to those of normal galaxies ?",
    "if so , we can conclude that the e+a phenomenon also involves changes in their older population . in that case",
    ", models trying to explain the nature of the e+a galaxies should also fit the signatures observed in the old stellar content .",
    "in order to investigate the above questions , i have started a program to observe southern e+a galaxies in the near - ir . all the observations are being carried on at las campanas observatory ( lco ) , using nicmos3 hgcdte arrays ( 256 @xmath10 256 pixels ) at both the 1-m swope telescope ( 0.599 arcsec / pix , 2.5 arcmin@xmath11 fov ) , and the 2.5-m du pont telescope ( 0.42 arcsec / pix , 1.8 arcmin@xmath11 fov ) .",
    "all the observations are carried on under photometric conditions and seeing @xmath12 arcsec , and include @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 imaging .",
    "the sample of galaxies includes e+as from nearby ( @xmath13 , [ 2 ] ) and intermediate - redshift ( @xmath14 , [ 4 ] ) clusters , as well as e+as located in the field [ 5 ] , at @xmath2 .",
    "photometry is performed on the calibrated images using sextractor [ 6 ] .",
    "_ total _ apparent magnitudes and colors are computed , and compared with spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution generated using gissel96 [ 7 ] ( see figure [ colors ] ) .",
    "rest - frame colors are extremely dependent on models , necessary to compute k - corrections .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy will be obtained soon , in order to have reliable k - corrections , allowing to derive robust interpretations from rest - frame colors .",
