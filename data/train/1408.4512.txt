    "comprehensive radio and x - ray observations ( see the reviews by @xcite , and @xcite , and references therein ) and numerical models @xcite have established that the interactions between radio jets and the intracluster medium ( icm ) counteract the cooling by x - rays in galaxy clusters , in which `` cooling flows '' would develop without the energy input by the agn of the central cluster galaxy .",
    "this form of feedback , termed `` radio - mode '' feedback , is invoked in semi - analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation to regulate the growth of the most massive galaxies and explain their deficit in present - day galaxy - luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "the hydra a cluster ( abell 780 ) is a well - studied , relatively nearby cool core cluster at a distance to the central radio galaxy of approximately 230 mpc ( @xmath7 = 0.054 ) .",
    "there exists a wealth of radio and x - ray observations of the jets of hydra a and of the ambient icm @xcite .",
    "therefore , detailed models of the evolution of the radio jets in the hydra a environment have the potential to provide valuable insights into the physics of radio - mode feedback .    using high - resolution _ chandra _ data @xcite showed that hydra a is a cooling flow galaxy cluster with a mass accretion rate of approximately @xmath8@xmath9 beyond 30  kpc from the centre of the x - ray source .",
    "however , inside 30  kpc the mass accretion rate indicated by the x - ray spectroscopy drops sharply indicating that a heating mechanism is active near the cluster centre .",
    "a discontinuity in the x - ray surface brightness and temperature profiles indicates the existence of a large scale shock front at @xmath10  @xmath11 kpc @xcite .",
    "x - ray surface brightness deficiencies in the atmosphere were identified as a chain of x - ray cavities associated with radio bubbles @xcite .",
    "hydra a has also been observed at a wide range of radio frequencies .",
    "low frequency very large array ( vla ) observations reveal the remnants of the early epochs of radio activity @xcite , while ghz observations reveal active jets and inner radio lobes in the central @xmath12 kpc @xcite .",
    "[ fig1]a is a reproduction of the 4.635 ghz image in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "in the inner region of the radio source both jets flare , producing plumes at a deprojected distance of approximately 10 kpc from the core , assuming an inclination angle @xmath13 derived from rotation measure asymmetries @xcite .    in the northern jet , a bright knot at a deprojected distance of @xmath14 kpc from the core is apparent just before the jet flares . at approximately 3.7  kpc from the core ,",
    "another fainter knot is visible .",
    "a more bright third knot within the turbulent region at approximately 11.7  kpc is also visible . in the southern jet four bright knots are apparent at @xmath15 from the core .",
    "the bright knots and the flaring points are enlarged and clearly seen in the zoomed - in region shown in panels b and c of fig .",
    "the trajectories of the northern and southern jets in the inner 10 kpc from radio core exhibit an s - shaped structure , which persists in morphology of the plumes .",
    "the rotationally symmetric s - structure is also evident in the low frequency images at 74 mhz and 330 mhz @xcite .",
    "the spatial anti - correlation between radio and x - ray emission in hydra a strongly indicates that the radio jets impact large volumes of the icm gas and regulate the cooling flow in hydra a. the correlation between jet power and x - ray luminosity in the @xcite sample support such a scenario in cooling flow clusters in general .    in recent years",
    ", several models of the hydra a radio source and the icm have been presented .",
    "@xcite proposed , using hydrodynamic simulations , that the interaction of very powerful jets ( @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 ) with a spherically symmetric hydrodynamic environment can reproduce the observed large scale shock front with a mach number @xmath18 . in order to explain an offset of 70 kpc between the centre of the shock ellipse and the cluster core , the interaction was deemed to take place in two stages : first , active jets propagate through a hydrostatic environment within 100 kpc from the core ; second , the jets turn off and buoyant bubbles rise through a background environment that has a bulk velocity of 670 km s@xmath17 relative to the central galaxy . in that study ,",
    "the base of the jet in the hydrodynamic simulations is located at approximately 10 kpc from the core where the jet radius is approximately 6 kpc .",
    "the inner 10 kpc region , where the jet has not yet transitioned to a turbulent flow , was not explored .",
    "@xcite also modelled hydra a using axisymmetric , hydrodynamic simulations and showed that a single outburst can produce a series of x - ray deficient bubbles . in their model , the vortex shedding and the kelvin - helmholtz instabilities at the contact discontinuity of the shocked icm and the shocked jet plasma are responsible for multiple x - ray cavities .",
    "so far , the theoretical modelling of hydra a has focused on the large - scale structures , such as the cavities and the shock fronts bounding the expanding bubbles .",
    "however , no numerical simulations have related the outer structure of the radio source to the structure within @xmath19 kpc of the radio core .",
    "one feature in particular that demands attention is the jet - plume transitions in the northern and southern jets , which mark a dramatic change in the flow properties of the jets .    in this series of papers we address several aspects of the radio and x - ray properties of hydra a.",
    "these include the energy budget of the radio source and its inner 10 kpc structure . in this first paper",
    "we concentrate on the physics of the jets in the first 10 kpc and develop the following model : initially the supersonic jets are conically expanding and over - pressured with respect to the interstellar medium ( ism ) as they emerge from the core . as their pressure decreases , they start to come into pressure equilibrium with the ( ism ) and produce a series of biconical shocks , which are visible as knots . in conjunction with this process the jet boundary oscillates .",
    "the spacing of the knots and the variation in jet radius are sensitive to the overpressure ratio and the velocity of the jet ( for a given jet kinetic power ) enabling us to estimate both .",
    "in addition , the jets decelerate at each shock and make a transition to turbulence @xcite consistent with the formation of plumes in the radio image ( see [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we note however , that this transition is only indicative since turbulence is a three - dimensional phenomenon , which is not fully probed by the axisymmetric simulations that we employ here .",
    "paper  ii considers three - dimensional phenomena .",
    "as noted , in paper ii , we utilise three - dimensional simulations and model the dynamical interaction of the jets and the icm utilising a precessing jet model . in a third paper",
    "we address the detailed radio and x - ray emission features predicted by our model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in   [ jet_kinetic_power ] we discuss estimates of the jet kinetic power and composition . the description of our model of the interaction of initially conical and ballistic hydra a jets with the cluster environment is presented in   [ s : model ] . in ",
    "[ s : cluster ] we construct an analytic model of the density , temperature and pressure of the hydra  a icm from fits to published x - ray data .",

    "we summarise and discuss our results in ",
    "[ s : discussion ] .",
    "in order to construct physically realistic models of the interaction of the radio - jets with the environment of hydra  a , we require good estimates of the jet kinetic power and the spatial profiles of density , temperature and pressure in the cluster atmosphere .",
    "previous estimates of the jet power @xcite are based on x - ray observations of the outer shock and the cavities produced by the radio source . in this section we both supplement and",
    "confirm these estimates by utilising radio data of the inner lobes of hydra  a.      @xcite focused on the outer shock evident in the x - ray image and used a spherically symmetric hydrodynamic model of a point explosion in an initially isothermal and hydrostatic environment to produce theoretical x - ray surface brightness profiles for hydra  a. their best fit to the observed x - ray brightness profile gives a shock age @xmath20 and an explosion energy @xmath21 .",
    "the estimated power of the outburst is @xmath22 . on the basis of this model , we would associate @xmath23 with each jet .",
    "@xcite used the observations of three pairs of x - ray cavities revealed in _",
    "images to estimate the power of the hydra  a jets .",
    "the inner cavities a and b correspond to the 4.6  ghz radio lobes @xcite , the cavities c and d correspond to the middle lobe in the 1.4 ghz radio image @xcite and the outer cavities e and f correspond to the outer lobes in the 330 mhz image @xcite .",

    "consider that the three cavities on each side are interconnected and use the sum of the enthalpies , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the polytropic index , @xmath26 is the pressure of the lobe and @xmath27 is the volume of the cavity , in all cavities to calculate a total outburst energy . from this ,",
    "the combined jet power is calculated , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the age of each cavity .",
    "the average of three different cavity age estimates was used : the time required for the x - ray cavity to reach its present position if moving at the sound speed , the refilling time of the x - ray cavity , and the time required for the x - ray cavity to rise buoyantly to the present position .",
    "assuming pressure equilibrium of the lobes with the atmosphere they obtained powers for the inner and middle lobes of @xmath30 and for the outer lobes , @xmath31 , which gives a combined jet power @xmath32 .",
    "the authors find that a power of @xmath33 erg s @xmath17 for the northern jet is consistent with the supposition that the jet is still filling the outermost of the x - ray cavities at @xmath10 kpc ( the corresponding radio lobe is visible at 330 mhz ) and driving the large - scale shock .",
    "an independent estimate of the jet power from the expansion rate of the outermost cavity , assuming a self - similar evolution of the radius of the cavity wall and the large scale shock agrees with their first estimate to within a factor of 2 .",
    "this value of the jet power @xmath33 erg s @xmath17 is also consistent with the estimate of the jet power obtained by @xcite noted above .",

    "the contour image of the synthetic surface brightness is shown in the right panel . here",
    "we see that , in the shocked zone beyond each biconical shock , the pressure increases , producing bright knots in each region .",
    "this image reproduces some qualitative features of the data : the second and third knots are significantly brighter and more extended than the first knot .",
    "however , the brightness ratios of the knots are not reproduced .",
    "observationally ( corrected for resolution ) the second knot is 8.7 times brighter than the first and the third knot is 3 times brighter than the second .",
    "the model values are 2.5 and 1.14 respectively .",
    "in addition , in the observed jet , the fwhm extent of the second knot in the jet direction is 3.3  kpc compared to 0.6  kpc for the model .",
    "these differences may possibly be attributed to the approximate magnetic field model , which we have used , or the lack of turbulent three dimensional structure in our simulations .",
    "these are aspects to which we can return with three - dimensional simulations with magnetic field",
    ".              these two - dimensional models can not adequately reproduce the structure of the entire source , in particular the plume like regions beyond approximately @xmath105 .",
    "these are probably the result of three - dimensional turbulence and/or precession , and these effects will be addressed in subsequent papers in this series .",
    "however , we note that our numerical models _ qualitatively _ reproduce the turbulent transition of the jets to plumes , albeit at a distance of 14  kpc compared to approximately 11 kpc deprojected in hydra  a. in the density image snapshot at approximately 20 myr of run civ , fig .",
    "[ t_trans ] ( the left panel shows the full computational domain and the right panel is the zoom in section indicates by the rectangle in the left panel ) , a series of biconical shocks appears in the jet .",
    "deceleration of the jet occurs at these shocks and the jet becomes subsonic after the fourth shock at @xmath106 ( see the variation of mach number of the flow with distance along the jet axis in fig .",
    "[ mach ] ) . beyond 14  kpc",
    "the jet transitions to turbulence as a result of the axisymmetric kelvin - helmholtz instability , which becomes stronger as the mach number decreases . )",
    "although our axisymmetric jet simulations shed some light on the turbulent transition of the jet , it is well known that turbulence and the formation of plumes are three dimensional phenomena , especially in supersonic flows .",
    "we study the details of these features of the inner 50 kpc of the hydra a jets in our ensuing three dimensional study .",
    "we have used the 6 cm vla data of @xcite to determine the flux density ratio of the northern and southern jets within the first 10 kpc , obtaining a value @xmath107 attributing this ratio to doppler beaming , and using the inclination estimated by @xcite , implies a moderately relativistic jet @xmath108 . however , our parameter space study produces a higher jet velocity @xmath109 which , on the basis of a simple estimate , would give a brightness ratio @xmath110 .",
    "however , in our model , the emissivity is dominated by the decelerated post - shock regions of the jet , so that we estimate the brightness ratio from the synthetic brightness images of approaching and receding jets . with this approach",
    ", we obtain a simulated flux density ratio of 33 which still differs significantly from the observed value by a factor @xmath111 .",
    "we ran several additional models with jet @xmath75 , different jet inlet radii 120  pc , 100  pc , 80  pc and 60  pc and different pressure ratio 5 , 10 , and 15 , keeping the jet kinetic power constant at @xmath112 .",
    "we have not decreased the jet radius below 60  pc because that would require an even more highly over pressured jet to obtain the correct radius profile .",
    "these @xmath113 models are summarised in table  [ t : sim_par ] ( set d ) and the comparison of the simulated and observed shock positions and radius profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : p_s_b5 ] .",
    "it is evident that no model with the given jet kinetic power and jet @xmath75 is able to produce good fits for both the shock position and the jet radius .",
    "the shock spacings are all significantly larger than the observed shock spacing and the radius profiles are mismatched with these models .    from the above we can say that if we fix the inclination angle at the @xcite value of @xmath114 and fix the jet kinetic power at @xmath112 , then the jet pressure , jet velocity and the inlet jet radius at 0.5  kpc away from the core of the hydra a northern jet are well - constrained by both the jet radius profile and the first two knot / shock spacings .",
    "the best - fit values are @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "thus , there is a discrepancy in the flux density ratio between the simulated and observed jets .",
    "two potential explanations of the low flux density ratio are : i ) since our models do not include the magnetic field , we employ the assumption @xmath117 which gives a brightness ratio 33 .",
    "if we further assume that the magnetic field is 2.5 times stronger in the southern jet of hydra a we would obtain a lower brightness ratio @xmath14 .",
    "ii ) the southern jet is more dissipative since it is more twisted and produces more shocks producing a larger intrinsic emissivity than the northern jet .      .",
    "the dashed vertical lines represent the upper limits of @xmath118 for each model ( set a  red , set b  black , and set c  green ) .",
    "these limits are estimated for @xmath119 using eqn .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) .",
    "( a colour version of this figure is available in the online journal ) ]    in the above models we have used the angle between the jet and the line of sight , @xmath120 , estimated by @xcite from the rotation measure asymmetry of hydra  a. however , there is a fairly large uncertainty in their estimate of @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "increasing @xmath121 from @xmath123 , would reduce the brightness ratio ?",
    "however , for larger inclinations , the deprojected knot separation would decrease , and as we have seen with the above models , this would require a higher velocity than @xmath124 , tending to _ increase _ the brightness ratio .",
    "similar considerations apply if we _",
    "decrease _ the inclination .",
    "nevertheless , is it possible that notwithstanding opposing effects , an inclination angle within the @xcite range , and a jet velocity , can be found that are consistent with the dual constraints of surface brightness ratio and projected knot spacing ?    in order to assess this possibility we adopted the following procedure : for @xmath50 within the range , @xmath125 ( the lower limit being defined by the brightness ratio , @xmath126 ) we first estimate the value of @xmath121 corresponding to @xmath127 , using the standard doppler beaming formula , @xmath128 . for these values of @xmath129",
    "we determine the deprojected spacing between the first two shocks @xmath130 given the observed spacing of 2.25  kpc .",
    "this is shown , as a function of the 4-velocity , @xmath118 , as the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ f : ss ] .",
    "we then compare the observed deprojected knot spacings with the values inferred from the simulations so that in fig .",
    "[ f : ss ] the simulated shock spacing , for model sets a , b and c , are also plotted as functions of @xmath118 .",
    "the upper limits on the 4-velocity for each model ( estimated from eqn .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) ) , associated with a zero density parameter , @xmath119 , are also shown as dashed vertical lines .",
    "the first point to note with this comparison is that for most of allowable range of @xmath50 fig .",
    "[ f : ss ] shows that the calculated shock spacing exceeds the observed , deprojected value . at the upper end of the @xmath50 range the simulated shock spacings for each model asymptote to @xmath131 kpc for values of @xmath132 , i.e. , @xmath133 .",
    "however the asymptote of the observed shock spacing @xmath134 kpc .",
    "hence , there is an offset of approximately 0.5  kpc between the asymptotes of the simulated and observed shock spacing for @xmath132 .    at the other end of the allowable range of velocity , @xmath135 ( @xmath136 )",
    ", it could be inferred that the simulations and observations intersect at approximately this limiting value .",
    "however , this is the result of the steepness at @xmath135 of the ( blue ) curve representing the observed deprojected shock spacing as a function of 4-velocity , rather than a real physical correspondence between observed and simulated values",
    ". it would be fortuitous if the jet initial velocity were to be almost exactly the same as the lower limit on the jet velocity implied by beaming .",
    "hence we reject a solution at this end of the @xmath50 range on the basis of the `` fine - tuning '' that would be involved in accepting it .",
    "another unappealing feature of a low-@xmath50 solution is that the jet would be initially heavy with @xmath137 . as we noted above , observations and modelling of x - ray observations of the lobes of radio galaxies",
    "indicate that jets are initially electron - positron in composition @xcite and @xmath137 is inconsistent with this .",
    "another way of looking at the issue of reconciling shock spacing and flux ratios is the following : consider the simulation points near the upper end of the @xmath50 range in fig .",
    "[ f : ss ] , where the discrepancy between the observed jet and simulated jets with @xmath138 is the least . by way of example , consider the ( green ) point in simulation series c with @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the simulated flux ratio ( see   [ s : b_r ] ) for this model is 26.5 , a factor of 3.8 higher than the observed value .",
    "thus , even for these models there is an implication of intrinsic differences in the northern and southern jet rest - frame emissivities .",
    "moreover , this ratio is not very different from the value of 33 for the @xmath141 , @xmath5 model considered earlier .    in view of the above ,",
    "we conclude that , taking into account the modelling of shock spacing , radius evolution and surface brightness ratios , the most likely situation is that of fast , @xmath142 , jets with an intrinsic difference between the rest - frame emissivities of northern and southern jets .",
    "the main thrust of this paper has been to understand the physics of the inner jets in hydra  a with a view to using inferred parameters such as jet energy flux , pressure , density and velocity in large scale models of the radio source and its interaction with the cluster atmosphere .",
    "we have focused on the following key features of the inner ( @xmath143 from the core ) : i ) the bright knots in the northern jet at @xmath144 kpc from the black hole ii ) and the wave - like boundary of the northern jet . to this end , we have performed a series of two dimensional axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of the northern hydra a jet with the interstellar medium , particularly within the central @xmath145 .    to ensure that we use reasonable values for the jet parameters in our simulations ,",
    "we have estimated the powers associated with the inner x - ray cavities of hydra  a corresponding to the inner radio lobes .",
    "we have used 4.6  ghz radio observations by @xcite to estimate the inner cavity power and have compared them with the estimates of @xcite for the same cavities based on the x - ray data .",
    "we obtain powers for the northern and southern cavities @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the @xcite estimates @xmath148 for both cavities .",
    "hence , we adopt the total jet power obtained by @xcite @xmath149 erg @xmath150 as our value for the jet power in the numerical models . other jet parameters , the jet pressure @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ; @xmath153 ambient pressure ) and the jet inlet radius @xmath154(@xmath155 ) are chosen based on the 23  cm vlba and 6  cm vla data of hydra a @xcite .    on the basis of the minimum pressure estimates we conclude that , in the lobes , @xmath156 , the ratio of energy in other particles to that in relativistic electrons @xmath157 .",
    "moderate values of this parameter are supported by other recent studies : @xcite estimated @xmath156 for a group of radio galaxies assuming that the radio lobes are in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium .",
    "their estimates include the hydra a radio lobes at 1.4 ghz for which they obtained a value of @xmath158 .",
    "@xcite studied the inverse - compton x - ray emission from the outer hydra a radio lobes and obtained values of @xmath159 and 23 for minimum lorentz factor cut - offs of @xmath160 and 10 respectively .",
    "these estimates are all comparable given the different techniques used to derive them .    for the x - ray atmosphere used in our simulations",
    ", we have constructed hydrostatic profiles surrounding the hydra a radio source by fitting and extrapolating the density and temperature data from the x - ray observations of @xcite .",
    "the results of our numerical models of the interaction of initially conical and ballistic jet with the ambient medium support the idea that the consecutive biconical shocks are responsible for the bright knots in the northern jets of hydra a. with appropriate values of the initial jet pressure ratio and velocity the observed knot spacings and variation in jet radius are reproduced along a considerable section of the jet . we did not model the southern jet since it is more twisted and a straight jet model would be inappropriate ; furthermore the radius of the southern jet as a function of distance from the core has not been observationally determined .    from our comprehensive parameter study",
    "we have selected models ciii , civ and cv as are our best fit models for the inner @xmath157 kpc radio structure of the northern jet .",
    "these jet models with initially conical and ballistic jet and over - pressured with respect to the environment by a factor of 5 produce four successive biconical reconfinement shocks before the jets become fully turbulent .",
    "the location of the first three shocks and the radius profile of the jet along its propagation closely match the location of the southern edge of the bright knots and the radius profile of the hydra a northern jet . constructing a synthetic surface brightness image",
    "we have shown that the biconical shocks produced in the simulated jet are associated with bright knots . for our best fit models of the northern jet ,",
    "the jet parameters are @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "our estimated jet velocity for the northern jet of hydra a @xmath166 is consistent with a recent theoretical estimate of jet velocity for fri radio jets provided by @xcite . in the course of modelling the surface brightness of 10 fri radio sources they estimated a kpc scale jet velocity @xmath166 .",
    "the brightness of the knots in our best fit model gradually increase with distance from the core , in a way that is qualitatively consistent with the observed jet .",
    "however the brightness ratio between the second and first knot and between the third and second knot for the simulated jet ( run ciii ) @xmath167 and 1.14 respectively , differs from the observed brightness ratio @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "this discrepancy may arise as a result of the magnetic field increasing faster than the pressure along the jet and hence the assumption of @xmath170 in the emissivity model would underestimate the emissivity increase along the jet .",
    "our inferred relativistic jet velocity @xmath171 differs from the estimate based on the doppler beaming @xmath172 .",
    "consequently we estimate a large flux density ratio 33 of the approaching and receding jet compared to the observed flux density ratio of 7 .",
    "our additional parameter study in   [ s : b_r ] shows that the combination @xmath75 , jet kinetic power @xmath173 and an inclination angle",
    "@xmath13 is unable to produce the correct shock locations and the profile of the jet boundary for any feasible combination of the jet inlet radius and pressure .",
    "hence , one possibility is to adopt @xmath174 and to attribute the different flux density ratio to a difference in intrinsic rest - frame emissivities .",
    "for example , the flux density ratio may be overestimated in our best fit model since we assume that the magnetic field is the same in both jets .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic field is 2.5 times stronger in the southern jet , the flux density ratio would be 7 .",
    "another possibility is that the observed value of the flux density ratio is low since the southern jet is more dissipative as a result of its greater bending and the greater number of shocks .",
    "another possibility for the discrepancy between estimated and measured flux density ratios is that the angle , @xmath121 , between the jet and the line of sight , inferred from the rotation measure asymmetry ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) differs from @xmath114 .",
    "this is certainly possible given the range @xmath122 estimated by @xcite .",
    "hence , we have used the jet velocity as a parameter , calculated the inclination required to give a northern to southern flux ratio of 7 , calculated the deprojected spacing between the first and second knots and compared this with the simulated spacing .",
    "the result of this comparison has been that the simulated and observed spacings do not agree except at the lowest possible jet velocities , consistent with a beaming interpretation , @xmath175 .",
    "we have argued that a solution for the jet velocity at around @xmath176 is unappealing since it is unlikely that the optimal velocity for knot spacing would be close to the lower limit from beaming .",
    "we conclude that the jet velocities @xmath177 and that there is an intrinsic asymmetry between the rest - frame emissivities of the northern and southern jets .",
    "this may be a result of different magnetic fields ( by about a factor of 2.5 ) or higher dissipation in the southern jet .",
    "the initial value ( at 0.5  kpc ) of the density parameter @xmath178 derived from our simulations is also of interest for the parsec - scale value of this parameter . assuming that the key has constant velocity from the pc - scale outwards , @xmath179 and @xmath180 so that @xmath181 . from the vlbi images of @xcite @xmath182 in the 15.4  ghz image .",
    "hence our best fit value of @xmath183 extrapolates to 0.59  consistent with an electron - positron jet with @xmath184 or an electron proton jet with @xmath185 .",
    "our conclusions are subject to the assumption of a low magnetic pressure in the jet and we have provided some justification for this assumption , on the sub - parsec scale in   3 and the lack of magnetic collimation from the parsec to kiloparsec scale .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic field evolves along a jet , and its downstream strength and influence on the dynamics is an interesting issue .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field is important for the calculation of synchrotron emission so that even if it passively transported , its evolution is important for the calculation of surface brightness . hence , the inclusion of a magnetic field in future simulations is of interest .",
    "however , as @xcite has shown there is a lot more physics to consider in this case , in particular the modelling of reconnection of three - dimensional magnetic field .",
    "thus , while magnetic effects are important to consider in future work , their consideration is well beyond the scope of this paper , which we consider to be a useful first step in modelling features such as shock spacing and radial oscillations in order to estimate jet velocities .",
