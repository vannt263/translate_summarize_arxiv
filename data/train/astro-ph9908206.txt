    "soon after the launch of the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ in 1991 , observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) established two important global properties of grbs : an isotropic sky distribution @xcite and a radial distribution incompatible with a uniform population in euclidean space @xcite . the evidence for a non - uniform radial distribution was based on either the @xmath11 distribution or the @xmath12 distribution of the observed grbs .",
    "the @xmath11 distribution of the peak flux @xmath13 should be a power law of slope @xmath14 for a uniform population in euclidean space .",
    "the observed distribution was shallower , particularly at lower fluxes @xcite . for a uniform population",
    ", the @xmath12 distribution would be uniform between 0 and 1 , with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "early batse observations yielded @xmath16 , significantly different from the value expected for homogeneity @xcite .",
    "a cosmological distance scale of grbs is compatible with the isotropic sky distribution and the radial distribution @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by the first observation of a large redshift for a grb afterglow @xcite .",
    "the distance scale in this cosmological scenario for grbs has been derived from the observed @xmath11 distribution , usually on the assumption that grbs are standard candles @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that relaxing the standard candle assumption renders a broad range of models consistent with the batse @xmath11 relation .    in this _ letter _ , we are reporting the results of setting the cosmological distance scale of grbs , assuming a full luminosity function and using the euclidean @xmath17 value as a distance indicator .",
    "we use the bd2 sample of grbs derived from 5.9 years of batse discla data , briefly described in sec .",
    "the characterization of the luminosity function and its evolution , and the derivation of predicted distributions of luminosity , @xmath12 , redshift , and flux are discussed in sec .",
    "the results for a variety of luminosity functions are presented in sec . 4 and the conclusions are summarized in sec",
    "we are assuming in this paper a hubble constant @xmath18 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and zero cosmological constant .",
    "we use a large homogeneous sample ( the bd2 sample ) of 1391 grbs derived from batse discla data , consisting of the continuous data stream from the eight batse detectors in four energy channels on a time scale of 1024 msec @xcite .",
    "this sample is a revision , described below , of the bd1 sample which resulted from a search of discla data over the period tjd @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the bd1 sample was based on a trigger algorithm that used the background both before and after the onset of the burst and required an excess of at least @xmath20 over background in at least two detectors in the energy range @xmath5 kev .    in the process of classifying triggers for the creation of the bd1 sample @xcite",
    ", we had accepted 1018 discla triggers that were within 230 sec of a grb in the batse catalog @xcite as genuine grbs .",
    "in addition , we classified another 404 discla triggers as grbs .",
    "in a subsequent revision , we have now inspected the output of the batse detectors over a time interval of 12,000 sec around each of the 404 grbs not in the batse catalog , as well as those in the catalog for which times or positions differed appreciably . in the process",
    ", we rejected 7 triggers as caused by source fluctuations , 18 turned out to be parts of other grbs of long duration , and 6 were identified as the soft repeater sgr1806 - 20 and rejected . as a consequence of the revision",
    ", the bd2 sample now contains 1391 grbs , of which 1013 are listed in the batse catalog , another 377 are classified as grbs , and one as a probable grb .    for the purpose of this paper , we can characterize the bd2 sample as follows .",
    "the number of grbs is 1391 .",
    "the sample effectively represents 2.003 years of full sky coverage @xcite , so the rate is 694 grbs per year .",
    "the average euclidean @xmath12 is @xmath21 .",
    "the limiting flux has a distribution @xmath22 that has been derived as follows . for 104 positions of fixed celestial coordinates distributed isotropically around the sky , we checked every 100 sec during every tenth day whether the sky position was above the horizon and whether the time did not fall in an exclusion window set up to avoid interference or bad data @xcite .",
    "if so , we converted the limiting count of 5 times the square root of the observed background in the second brightest illuminated detector into a limiting flux @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting distribution @xmath22 has a median at 0.37 ph @xmath24 s@xmath3 , and 10 and 90 percentiles at 0.29 ph @xmath24 s@xmath3 and 0.51 ph @xmath24 s@xmath3 , respectively , in the @xmath5 kev band .",
    "since the number of redshifts of grbs is as yet too small for a statistical derivation of the luminosity function , we will instead _ assume _ a full luminosity function and then use the observed number of grbs and their euclidean @xmath17 in the bd2 sample to derive properties such as the local space density and the characteristic luminosity @xmath25 .",
    "we will find that these properties vary relatively little as we change the shape of the luminosity function .",
    "experience has shown that the differential luminosity function of many types of extragalactic objects can be represented as a broken power law ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite for x - ray active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "we will use a broken power law , and in addition introduce upper and lower limits of luminosity , thus allowing both narrow ( standard candle ) and more realistic broad luminosity functions .",
    "we will also assume density evolution , to be introduced below .",
    "the local luminosity function of peak grb luminosities @xmath26 , defined as the co - moving space density of grbs in the interval @xmath27 to @xmath28 , is    @xmath29    given that most types of extragalactic objects show evolution , and considering that the rate of star formation may be relevant for grbs @xcite , we introduce density evolution @xmath30 . in most cases ,",
    "we have assumed @xmath31 while any type of evolution can be explored @xcite , we have used in this _",
    "letter _ only the case @xmath32 and @xmath33 without a decline toward larger redshifts @xcite . the luminosity function at redshift @xmath34 is @xmath35 .      in principle , with the full characterization of the bd2 sample given in sec . 2 and the luminosity function @xmath36 with all its free parameters set , we can predict or model all properties of the sample .",
    "our procedure will be to assume values for the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , and then to vary @xmath25 until the predicted value of the euclidean @xmath17 equals the observed value in the bd2 sample , and to set @xmath41 to fit the observed number of grbs .",
    "the modeling procedure involves the derivation of the peak flux @xmath42 of a grb of peak luminosity @xmath26 observed at redshift @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bolometric luminosity distance and @xmath45 is the integral of the spectral energy distribution between @xmath46 kev and @xmath47 kev .",
    "we use a band spectrum @xcite for the energy distribution with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 kev in the restframe .    objects with luminosity @xmath26 observed in a part of the bd2 sample with flux limit @xmath23 are detectable to a maximum redshift @xmath51 that is easily derived from eq.(4 ) .",
    "the total number of objects in the sample is @xmath52 based on this model we can derive the distributions of the peak flux @xmath13 , the euclidean @xmath53 , the peak luminosity @xmath26 , and the redshift @xmath34 .",
    "these form the basis for the discussion of results below .",
    "we exhibit in table  [ tbl-1 ] numerical results for 18 luminosity function models , nine each for the cases @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "all are based on a hubble constant @xmath18 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and zero cosmological constant . among the nine cases ,",
    "two have zero density evolution , six have evolution as described in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , and one is an exponential of cosmic time . in the six cases , we explored variations of the extent of the luminosity function below @xmath25 , as well as of the logarithmic slopes of both parts , cf .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] .    as an example , model 14 uses the deceleration parameter @xmath0 and logarithmic slopes of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the power law luminosity function , which extends from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the model has density evolution @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the relation between the model values of @xmath17 and @xmath62 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath64 , where the error is the formal error corresponding to that in @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is set by the total number of grbs in the bd2 sample . with the luminosity function of model 14",
    "fully characterized , we can derive the predicted distributions in the bd2 sample of the luminosities , the fluxes , the @xmath12 values and the redshifts ; the last three are illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] together with the luminosity function .",
    "apart from the obvious onset of incompleteness in the observed fluxes , the predicted @xmath11 agrees well with the observed distribution .",
    "the model distribution of @xmath12 shows fairly good agreement with the observations .",
    "the distribution of redshifts is broad , with some redshifts expected as large as 6 .",
    "the median redshift is 1.5 .",
    "besides the values of @xmath62 and @xmath41 derived for each model , we show in table  [ tbl-1 ] also the local ( @xmath65 ) space density @xmath66 of grbs integrated over the full range of luminosities @xmath26 , and the probability @xmath67 that a grb in the bd2 sample has a redshift @xmath68 .",
    "this probability is of interest , since one of the first observed grb redshifts was 3.4 @xcite . for the models with a standard candle luminosity function or with zero evolution ( nos .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , the values of @xmath67 are so low that they are inconsistent with the observed redshift of 3.4 .",
    "model 53 is similar to the standard candle luminosity models considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a luminosity about 3.5 times larger , and a local density 2.5 times smaller than those given in table 1 , while @xcite found a luminosity similar to our value .",
    "the broad luminosity functions considered by @xcite cover a range from @xmath71 erg s@xmath3 , overlapping with those in models @xmath72 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig3 ] a plot of @xmath66 vs. @xmath25 for all models .",
    "there are clear systematics that can be summarized as follows . from @xmath0 to @xmath9 local densities increase and characteristic",
    "luminosities decrease , both by a factor of about 2.5 .",
    "the effect of the density evolution adopted is to decrease local densities by a factor of @xmath73 and to increase @xmath25 by a factor of 3 . for given cosmology and evolution , local densities range over a factor less than 2 and",
    "@xmath25 over a factor of 6 .",
    "given that @xmath66 and @xmath25 tend to be inversely correlated , we derived for each model @xmath74 , the total peak output of grbs per unit volume at @xmath65 .",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] , @xmath74 is remarkably stable at @xmath75 erg s@xmath76gpc@xmath2 y@xmath3 for the adopted evolution . for zero evolution",
    ", @xmath74 is some 5 times larger .",
    "if the gamma radiation of grbs is beamed or collimated , say over @xmath77 steradians , then all luminosities should be multiplied by @xmath78 , and all space densities divided by @xmath78 .",
    "the total peak output @xmath74 is unaffected by beaming .",
    "we have shown that using primarily @xmath17 , we can derive properties of grbs of useful accuracy .",
    "we have used redshift information only in arguing that the observation of a redshift of 3.4 for a grb is unlikely if the luminosity function is a standard candle , or if the grb rate does not evolve with redshift . for density evolution rising to a factor of 10 at @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( for @xmath9 , cf .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , the local space density is 0.18 gpc@xmath2 y@xmath3 , with a range of only 40% among the models considered .",
    "characteristic peak luminosities range over a factor of 6 around @xmath6 erg s@xmath3 in the @xmath5 kev band .",
    "luminosities ( cf .",
    "end of sec .",
    "2 ) are higher than those given by @xcite suggests the possibility that all our fluxes @xmath13 may be high by around @xmath79 compared to batse fluxes .",
    "if this is confirmed , then the values of @xmath62 in table 1 should be corrected by @xmath80 and the emissivities @xmath74 reduced by @xmath79 , while space densities are essentially unchanged . ]",
    "derived in this study are peak luminosities ( strictly per 1024 msec ) , since the detection of grbs in the bd2 sample is on that time scale .",
    "we estimate the _ total _ energy radiated by grbs in gamma rays by integrating over the time profile and by extending the spectral range to @xmath8 kev . to account for the total energy radiated in the @xmath5 kev band integrated over the duration of the burst , we consulted data in the batse catalog @xcite .",
    "we find that for the @xmath81 strongest bursts , the ratio of fluence over peak flux is around @xmath82 s. the ratio of the energy radiated in a band of @xmath8 kev over that in the @xmath5 kev range based on the band spectrum @xcite with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 kev is 2.1 . we conclude that total luminosities over the @xmath8 kev band are 20 times larger than the @xmath5 kev peak luminosities .",
    "employing this factor , we obtain for @xmath0 a characteristic grb luminosity of @xmath7 erg in the @xmath8 kev band .",
    "similarly , the local emissivity of grbs @xmath74 discussed in sec .",
    "4 is @xmath10 erg gpc@xmath2 y@xmath3 in the @xmath8 kev band with very little range among the models .    band , d. l. , et al .",
