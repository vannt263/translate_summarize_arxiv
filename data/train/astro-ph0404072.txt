    "this ring is complementary to a shell of neutral hydrogen discovered previously by wade ( 1957 , 1958 ) .",
    "there are two nearby dark clouds within this ring , namely b35 and b30 , separated from @xmath1 ori by 2.2 and 2.7 deg , respectively . based on a h@xmath3 emission survey , duerr , imhoff & lada ( 1982 ) , identified three stellar clusters centered around b30 , b35 and @xmath1@xmath5 ori , respectively .",
    "those clusters were later confirmed from a statistical point of view by gmez & lada ( 1998 ) .",
    "dolan & mathieu ( 1999 , 2001 , 2002 ) collected moderately deep photometry ( vri filters ) in an area about 8 sq.deg .",
    "centered on the ob association , discovering a significant population of low mass stellar members , and obtained medium resolution multifiber spectroscopy for those candidates closest to the central star .",

    "according to dolan and mathieu ( 2002 ) , the turn - off age for the massive stars is of order 6 myr ( see also murdin & penston 1977 for another age determination based on the masive stars , 4 myr ) , although the star formation history might be more complex ( dolan & mathieu 2001 ) .",

    "section 3 presents the analysis of these datasets , whereas the results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "on september 29th and 30th , 1999 , we conducted an optical photometric survey around the star @xmath1 orionis , using the cfht 12k mosaic camera and the cousins @xmath8 and @xmath9 filters .",
    "this instrument covers a projected area on the sky of 42@xmath1028 arcminutes , with a scale of about 0.2 arcsec / pix .",
    "the data were collected under photometric conditions .",
    "the reduction was performed with the standard pipeline , and the extraction of the aperture photometry was carried out within the iraf environment .",
    "the astrometric calibration was tied to the usno - a2.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "our derived coordinates , on average , should be accurate to better than 1 arcsec , except for the objects closer to the edges of each detector .",
    "based on the results of the wide - field imaging survey of dolan & mathieu ( 2002 ) specifically their figures 6 and 8 , the separation of lambda ori from the b30 and b35 clusters , and the fov of the 12k mosaic , we believe that our survey should mostly include young stars from the cluster associated with lambda ori . furthermore , because of the very young age and moderate distance to the cluster , we expect the very low mass cluster stars to be well separated from field stars in a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the location of @xmath1 orionis , the dark clouds and the cfht 12k field .",
    "we collected two different sets of exposures , with short and long exposure times . in the first case , we exposed during 10 seconds for each filter , whereas the exposure times were 600 and 900 seconds cousins @xmath9 and @xmath8 filters , respectively , for the second set . with this method",
    ", we increased the dynamical range , and our photometry overlaps with previously published data in these filters .",

    "would not modify in a significant manner our member selection .",
    "we used a reddening of e@xmath11=0.084 .",
