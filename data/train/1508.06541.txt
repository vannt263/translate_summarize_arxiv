    "the substitution of the traditional local monte carlo ( lmc ) algorithm@xcite by wolff s spin flip cluster ( sfc ) algorithm@xcite then quickly allowed to clarify that this model indeed undergoes a kosterlitz - thouless transition@xcite , whose temperature is now known to five significant digits @xcite .",
    "sfc has played a decisive role in understanding the physics of the @xmath0 model@xcite , and in arriving at its detailed quantitative description .",

    "s markov - chain monte carlo algorithms generally follow the conventional paradigm based on three principles : 1/ each move represents a finite change of the configuration .",
    "it is independent of the previous move , and depends only on the configuration itself .",
    "2/ the algorithm satisfies the detailed - balance condition .",
    "3/ the decision whether a proposed move is accepted is based on the change in energy , using the metropolis acceptance rule or the heat - bath condition@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that the novel event - chain monte carlo ( ecmc ) paradigm@xcite , that has already been very successful in particle systems @xcite , can also be applied to the @xmath0 model  and the @xmath0 spin glass model .",
    "the paradigm breaks all three principles of the conventional markov - chain scheme : moves are infinitesimal rather than finite , although an event - driven scheme allows to recover finite displacements@xcite . in one - dimensional systems , the moves do not change with time . in multidimensional systems , moves persist on long time scales .",
    "this is achieved within the markov - chain scheme through additional `` lifting '' variables@xcite .",

    "finally , the decision on future moves is based on the change in pair energies , rather than the change in total energy .",

    "for the two - dimensional @xmath0 model  at the critical point , we find that ecmc is about 100 times faster than lmc , although the presence of a slow time scale in autocorrelation functions makes that it is not as fast as sfc . in the low - temperature phase of the three - dimensional @xmath0 spin glass model , where sfc is known to be inefficient ,",

    "multiple rejections are totally suppressed , and the choice of @xmath40 is unique@xcite . at each time step , either a lifting move or a physical move takes place , and ecmc is thus formally rejection - free .",
