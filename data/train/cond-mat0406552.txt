    "recently , there has been a lot of experimental progress studying cold atoms confined in optical lattices .",
    "the defect free nature of the lattice potential , the long coherence times of the constituent atoms , and the high experimental control of the lattice parameters @xcite make this a unique system for precisely studying many - body physics .",
    "in particular , the experimental observation of the superfluid to mott insulator quantum phase transition @xcite has stimulated much interest in this area of research .",
    "perhaps one of the most important potential applications of the mott insulator transition is to use it as a means to initialize a quantum computer register@xcite .",
    "particulary in this case , it is important to have tools for thoroughly characterizing the experimentally obtained mott insulator states .",
    "the usual procedure for entering the mott insulator regime is to begin with a magnetically trapped bec ( with almost all the atoms in the condensate ) , slowly load it into an optical lattice by increasing the lattice depth . one key piece of evidence for the quantum phase transition is the loss of global phase coherence of the matter wavefunction when the lattice depth increases beyond a critical value @xcite .",
    "however , the loss of coherence could arise from many sources , such as the decoherence induced by quantum or thermal depletion of the condensate during the loading process @xcite and therefore it is not a sufficient signature that the system is in the mott insulator state .",
    "for this reason , in the experiments by greiner _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , complementary evidence for the mott insulator transition was provided by applying a potential gradient to the lattice to show the presence of a gap in the excitation spectrum . in this paper",
    "we show that bragg spectroscopy , done by applying additional laser beams independent from the lattice beams , is an experimental technique with the potential to thoroughly characterize the mott phase .",
    "in addition to determining the energy gap , we show that it provides detailed information about the excitation spectrum , information unavailable using other techniques .",
    "moreover , in contrast to applying a potential across the lattice bragg spectroscopy is not susceptible to effects like bloch oscillations and zener tunneling .",
    "furthermore , we show that different from the superfluid regime , the system s response to bragg perturbation in the mott regime is sensitive to finite temperature .",
    "this property might be used as a tool to probe temperatures of order of the mott gap .",
    "our analysis is based on a perturbative treatment , which we show to be applicable in the strong mott regime that has been reached in current experiments @xcite .",
    "although our approach is applicable only in the range of validity of first order perturbation theory , it has the advantage of properly including one - particle - hole correlations .",
    "such correlations have dominant influence on the spectrum of the system and are not accounted for in mean - field treatments @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ form ] we introduce the basic formalism that describes bragg spectroscopy in an optical lattice and use a linear response approach to calculate the imparted energy to the system . in sec .",
    "[ zero ] we derive the zero temperature response to bragg spectroscopy of a translationally invariant lattice deep in the mott regime and in sec .",
    "[ validity ] we discuss the conditions required for our linear response analysis to be valid . in sec .",
    "[ fin ] we extend the zero temperature analysis to finite temperature and finally in sec .",
    "[ con ] we conclude .",
    "the typical bragg spectroscopic procedure is to gently scatter atoms in an ultra - cold gas system with a moving potential of the form @xmath1 .",
    "this type of experiment was first demonstrated by the nist and mit groups @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier experiments that used momentum as the response observable , here we choose to examine the imparted energy . in trapped systems",
    "this allows long excitation duration that facilitates more precise spectral resolution .",
    "energy - spectroscopy is not as well developed as momentum spectroscopy but recent experiments have demonstrated the use of this technique @xcite .",
    "the bragg potential is formed by the ac - stark shift arising from a pair of interfering light fields ( e.g. see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will always assume that the bragg potential is _ generated independently _ of and is much weaker than the lattice potential .",
    "we therefore treat the scattering process with linear response theory . using an independent set of beams to generate",
    "the bragg potential also provides considerable flexibility in the range of @xmath2 and @xmath3 values that can be obtained .    in this work",
    "we consider one - dimensional bosons loaded in an optical lattice .",
    "effective 1d systems have been realized in recent experiments ( for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) by loading a bose - einstein condensate into a three - dimensional optical lattice , which is very deep in two directions .",
    "the dynamics is then restricted to the third , or axial , direction only . in this work",
    "we study the response of the system to bragg perturbation in the axial direction , assuming that the dynamics in the transverse directions is frozen .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional optical lattice which is sufficiently deep that the tight binding approximation is valid and assume that we can restrict the dynamics of the atoms to the lowest vibrational band .",
    "this applies when changing the lattice potential does not induce band excitations .",
    "this condition is fulfilled when the frequency , @xmath3 , of the bragg perturbation is less than the gap between the first and second bands , and when the momentum transfer @xmath2 is contained within the first brillioun zone .",
    "a detailed analysis of the validity of this first - band approximation to study bragg scattering of a dilute weakly - interacting gas in an optical lattice is found in @xcite where the authors used a mean field approach combined with bogoliubov analysis . in the single - band approximation and in absence of external potentials ,",
    "the system is described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( bhh ) @xcite @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the annihilation operator at site @xmath6 which obeys the canonical commutation relations for bosons , @xmath7 is the hopping matrix element between nearest neighbors , and @xmath8 is the on - site repulsion energy .",
    "the sum @xmath9 is taken over nearest neighbors .",
    "we use @xmath10 for the total number of atoms and @xmath11 for the total number of wells . in the tight binding approximation",
    "the hamiltonian describing the bragg perturbation reads @xmath12 where the density fluctuation operator @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a geometrical factor that involves integration over wannier functions @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the lattice constant . for deep lattices @xmath18 @xcite .    to analyze the bragg spectrum of the system we study the energy transfer , which can be measured by time - of - flight techniques@xcite",
    "under linear response theory , the energy transfer is related to the so called _ dynamic structure factor _",
    ", @xmath19 , which is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are eigenstates and eigenenergies of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( [ eqnbhh ] ) , @xmath24 is the usual boltzmann factor with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath27 the temperature , @xmath28 is the canonical partition function , and @xmath29 . because of the factor @xmath30 , the system s response shows peaks whenever the frequency of the bragg perturbation matches the energy difference between two eigenstates of the bhh .",
    "the peak height is proportional to the the transition probability between the two eigenstates , @xmath31 .",
    "the total energy transfer after applying the bragg perturbation can be shown to be given by @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the duration of the perturbation and @xmath34 . here",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the dynamic structure factor assuming we are deep in the mott insulator regime , where treating the hopping term in the hamiltonian as a perturbation is justified .",
    "in this work we assume a commensurately filled lattice with no external confinement , filling factor @xmath35 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian includes only the on - site interaction term , which is diagonal in a number fock - state basis . to zeroth order",
    "the ground state @xmath36 is the fock state with @xmath37 atoms in every lattice site .",
    "the lowest lying excitations correspond to the one - particle - hole ( 1-ph ) states @xmath38 with @xmath39 particles at site @xmath40 , @xmath41 particles at site @xmath6 , and exactly @xmath37 particles in every other site .",
    "there are @xmath42 1-ph excitations and , because of the translational symmetry , they are degenerate at zeroth order with excitation energy @xmath8 . to zeroth order the dynamic structure factor vanishes . at first order the ground state wave - function is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the normalized translationally invariant state of adjacent particle - hole excitations . in order for perturbation theory to be valid ,",
    "the parameter @xmath45 has to be small @xcite .",
    "this could be a significant restriction for systems with a large number of filled sites but can be perfectly realized in experiments such as ref.@xcite where the system has only 20 occupied sites in the central tube . to find first order corrections to the @xmath42 low lying excited states",
    "we must diagonalize the kinetic energy hamiltonian within the 1-ph subspace . if we expand the eigenstates as a linear combinations of 1-ph excitations @xmath46 the necessary and sufficient conditions that the coefficients @xmath47 have to fulfill are @xmath48 with @xmath49 . besides eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) , the amplitudes @xmath50 have to satisfy periodic boundary conditions @xmath51 and the constraint @xmath52 ( which prevents particle and hole excitations occurring at the same site ) .",
    "( [ eig ] ) is analogous to the tight binding schrdinger equation of a two dimensional square lattice in the @xmath53-plane .",
    "the @xmath54 direction is associated with the position of the extra particle and the @xmath55 direction with the position of the hole .",
    "the different weights @xmath39 and @xmath37 can be understood in the 2d - lattice model as different effective masses in the two directions and the constraint @xmath56 as a hard wall along the @xmath57 line .",
    "the solutions are not straightforward due to the fact that the effective mass difference breaks the lattice symmetry around the @xmath57 axis and makes the hard wall constraint hard to fulfill . however , in the limiting case of high filling factor , @xmath58 the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) ( including the constraints ) are @xmath59 where we used @xmath60 , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the notation @xmath63 restricts the values of @xmath64 to the ones where @xmath65 is an odd number and @xmath66 to the values where @xmath65 is even .",
    "the constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 guarantee the orthogonality of the eigenmodes .    using eqs .",
    "( [ spect ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) we get an expression for the zero temperature dynamic structure factor given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 an integer between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the prime in the sum imposes the constraint @xmath75 is even .",
    "it is important to emphasize that only the states with @xmath76 have a dispersion relation which agrees to first order in @xmath7 to the mean - field solution found in ref .",
    "however , for these states @xmath77 .    in fig .",
    "[ 101 ] we compare the energy transfer as a function of the bragg frequency calculated from eq .",
    "( [ contr ] ) to results obtained by the exact diagonalization of the bhh for two values of bragg momenta @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to the superfluid regime @xcite , where bragg spectroscopy excites only the quasiparticle state with quasimomentum @xmath2 , in the mott regime we observe @xmath74 peaks pertaining to the two dimensional character of the 1-ph dispersion relation . the bragg momentum @xmath2",
    "fixes one quantum number @xmath64 but the other can take @xmath74 different values . in the analytic solution due to the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ contr ] ) , @xmath75 even , only @xmath78 of the possible @xmath74 peaks are present .",
    "the constraint is a consequence of the extra symmetry introduced in the high filling factor approximation where similar `` effective masses '' are assumed .    in the analytic solution ,",
    "bragg peaks have an overall envelope of the form of an inverted parabola centered at the gap energy @xmath8 , with a maximum height proportional to @xmath79 and extended over an interval with an approximated width of @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 dependence of the width and @xmath79 dependence of the height indicate that as @xmath2 approaches @xmath82 the energy transfer is highly peaked around @xmath8 .",
    "this behavior is observed in fig .",
    "[ 101 ] , where the overall width decreases as @xmath2 approaches @xmath82 , while the peak height increases . in spite of the fact that the analytic solution uses the high filling factor approximation ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath2 of the width and peak height of the envelope is in agreement with the @xmath83 exact energy response as shown in fig .",
    "[ 101 ] .",
    "we found no structure around @xmath84 in the exact numerical results .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the parameters used in this paper lie within the regime of validity of first - order perturbation theory .    for the form of energy spectroscopy we consider here",
    ", there is no fundamental limit to bragg pulsed durations in contrast to momentum - spectroscopy .",
    "however , practical considerations will likely inhibit the resolution of the individual excitation peaks in current experiments ( see discussion below ) . in this case the envelope shown in fig . [ 101 ] will provide a more realistic depiction of the experimentally observable spectrum .",
    "the treatment we present here is based on linear response . in this section",
    "we indicate its strict validity conditions in terms of the bragg strength @xmath85 which is the relevant experimental parameter .",
    "after the bragg perturbation is applied , the many - body state is no longer in the bhh ground state , @xmath86 . the transition probability to an excited state @xmath87 , @xmath88 ,",
    "according to first order perturbation theory is given by @xmath89 where the eigenenergies @xmath90 of the states are measured with respect to the ground state energy .",
    "the validity of linear response requires the total excited state population at the conclusion of the bragg perturbation to be small compared to unity : @xmath91    deep in the mott regime the response of the system is dominated by the @xmath11 excited states @xmath92 . because all these states have energies @xmath93 approximately given by @xmath8 , the maximum transfer energy possible is of order @xmath8 .",
    "the validity of linear response constrains the total imparted energy to be much less than @xmath8 and the heating rate @xmath94 due to the bragg perturbation to be much less than @xmath95 .",
    "it was previously shown that the @xmath11 excited states @xmath92 , have an energy spread given by @xmath96 ( eq .   ( [ spect ] ) ) , and matrix elements given by : @xmath97 , ( eq .   ( [ contr ] ) ) .",
    "the average separation between two consecutive states is of order @xmath98 .",
    "individually resolving the different lines will require one to apply the bragg pulse for a time of order @xmath99 . the validity of linear response , eq .",
    "( [ valid ] ) , therefore requires that @xmath100    for the parameters of ref.@xcite , where @xmath101rb atoms are trapped in a lattice of depth @xmath102 , the tunneling time @xmath103 is about @xmath104 .",
    "the number of occupied wells is @xmath105 , with a filling factor @xmath106 .",
    "resolving a single peak would require a bragg pulse of duration @xmath107 . with these conditions",
    "linear response is valid if @xmath108 . the acceptable heating rate is much less than @xmath109 .",
    "if the duration of the applied perturbation is @xmath110 , excited states will not be individually discernible .",
    "near resonance ( @xmath111 ) , for pulse durations smaller than the inverse bandwidth : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , all states will be resonantly excited . if @xmath114 the validity of linear response requires @xmath115    where the factor of @xmath116 , accounts for the contribution from all @xmath11 excited states .",
    "for the parameters given above this inequality implies @xmath117 . here",
    ", the acceptable heating rate is much less than @xmath118 .",
    "we note that in the superfluid regime the uncorrelated nature of the system allows for a less stringent validity condition to hold : it is only required the amount of excited atoms to be small compared to the condensate population .",
    "it is well known in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) that in the superfluid regime , bragg spectroscopy is not an appropriate tool for probing the temperature of the system .",
    "the reason is that even though @xmath19 is temperature dependent , experimental observables such as the energy transfer depend on @xmath119 which is very weakly temperature dependent .",
    "this is not the case deep in the mott insulator regime . in a translationally invariant lattice",
    "all the 1-ph excitations have an energy separation of order @xmath8 from the ground state and a splitting between them of order @xmath7 . if the temperature is @xmath120 , it is still valid to restrict the hilbert space to the one spanned by the 1-ph excitations . in this regime",
    "@xmath119 ( see eq .",
    "( [ impene ] ) ) can be written as : @xmath121 @xmath122    where the sum runs over the states in the one particle - hole band , and @xmath123 . the first term in eq.([hsq ] ) ,",
    "proportional to @xmath124 , causes a thermal reduction of the zero temperature response . the second term , which scales like @xmath125 , subspace",
    ", @xmath126 makes the system sensitive to low energy bragg perturbations at frequencies resonant with the energy difference between two 1-ph excitations .",
    "the factor @xmath127 suppresses the observability of these thermal effects for @xmath128 .    in fig .",
    "[ 103 ] we plot the energy transfer as a function of the bragg frequency , as calculated from exact diagonalization of the bhh for two different temperatures .",
    "the figure shows that for temperatures @xmath129 the height of the zero temperature peaks around @xmath8 decreases , while low frequency peaks appear .",
    "the presence of these low - frequency peaks is therefore a signature of finite temperature .",
    "in particular , if peaks around @xmath8 are observed in absence of low frequency response , the temperature is lower than @xmath130 . while this analysis does not provide",
    "a precise determination of the temperature , it is still useful because it shows that bragg spectroscopy is sensitive to temperatures of order of the interaction energy .",
    "current experimental techniques do not provide any information on the scale of @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , in current experiments temperature measurements rely on the analysis of atomic interference patterns after a certain time of flight following the release of atoms , and the measurement precision is of the order of the energy spacing to the second lattice band , which is typically one order of magnitude larger than @xmath8 .",
    "in recent experiments @xcite , bragg spectroscopy was performed using a setup where the bragg momentum equals the lattice momentum and response was observed . our present analysis , in agreement with previous ones(@xcite,@xcite ) , predicts no response for @xmath131 . using similar perturbative techniques as the ones described here",
    ", we extended our calculation to inhomogeneous systems with a strong harmonic magnetic confinement .",
    "we also found no scattering for @xmath131 in these systems .",
    "the fact that neither the inhomogeneity nor the finite size of the system are responsible for the observed signal suggests that nonlinear effects are the most plausible explanation for the experimental results .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that bragg spectroscopy can be a suitable experimental tool for characterizing the mott insulator phase . by measuring the transfer energy at different bragg momenta we proved",
    "it is possible to get information about the excitation spectrum : bragg peaks are centered around the characteristic mott excitation gap and are contained in an interval whose width is proportional to the 1-ph excitation band width .",
    "their average height is maximized when the bragg momentum approaches @xmath82 .",
    "finally looking at the low frequency response we showed that bragg spectroscopy is sensitive to temperatures of order of the mott gap .",
