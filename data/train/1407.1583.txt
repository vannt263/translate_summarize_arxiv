    "a conventional approach to shed light on the origin of cosmic rays ( crs ) is to search for anisotropy in the arrival directions distribution .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to find excess fluxes of crs correlated with large - scale structures in the nearby universe , resulting in several indications of possible anisotropic effects , but none of these effects have been confirmed independently ( some examples can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    by restricting the data under analysis exclusively to ground - based arrays , an essentially uniform exposure in the right ascension can be obtained . under this restriction , in the present paper we examine the data obtained from scintillation counters  surface detectors of the yakutsk array .",
    "the results of previous analysis of the @xmath0 distribution of extensive air shower ( eas ) primaries detected within the time period from january 1974 to may 2000 were published in refs .",
    "we have now analyzed the extended dataset up to june 2008 .",
    "additional data include , specifically , 7598 eas events above the threshold energy 1 eev ( = @xmath1 ev ) @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this analysis was to extend the time series of the data by using an observational time that was as long as possible .",
    "these efforts were aimed at testing the previous indications of possible anisotropy in the arrival directions of crs in the extended dataset using different methods .",
    "the yakutsk array site is located near oktyomtsy , the satellite village of yakutsk , at geographical coordinates @xmath4 and at a mean altitude of 105 m above sea level . at present",
    ", it consists of 58 ground - based and 4 underground scintillation counters to measure charged particles ( electrons and muons ) , and 48 detectors of the air cherenkov light . during its 40-year lifetime",
    ", the array has been reconfigured several times . before 1990 ,",
    "the total area covered by detectors was at its maximum ( @xmath5 km@xmath6 ) ; now , it is @xmath7 km@xmath6 .",
    "eas events were selected from the background using a two - level trigger of detector signals : the first level is a coincidence of signals from two scintillation counters in a station within 2 @xmath8s ; the second level is a coincidence of signals from at least three nearby stations ( not lined up ) within 40 @xmath8s .",
    "stations spaced @xmath9 m and @xmath10 m form the so - called trigger-500 and trigger-1000 , respectively . over the entire observation period ,",
    "more than @xmath11 showers of primary energy above @xmath12 ev were selected .",
    "[ fig : map ] shows the positions of detectors of the yakutsk array and the core positions of eass with @xmath13 eev .",
    "only scintillation counters of the array with spacing 500 and 1000 m are shown .",
    "other types of detectors are described , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the shower core coordinates were located fitting the lateral distribution of particle densities by the greisen - type function .",
    "core location errors are @xmath14 m for trigger-500 and @xmath15 m for trigger-1000 events .",
    "arrival angles of the eas primary particles were calculated in the plane shower front approximation using detection times at the stations . a clock pulse transmitter at the center of the array provided pulse timing to 100 ns accuracy .",
    "errors in arrival angles depend on the primary energy decreasing from @xmath16 at @xmath17 eev to @xmath18 above @xmath19 eev .",
    "more detailed information can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work , a sample of the analyzed dataset consisted of eas events detected in the period january 1974  june 2008 within the array area , with energy above @xmath20 eev , at zenith angles @xmath21 .",
    "the energy estimation method was based on the total flux measurement of the air cherenkov light and the number of electrons and muons at observation level  @xcite . to unify the energies of showers detected in a variety of years",
    ", we used the same @xmath22-to - energy relationship and attenuation length as in ref .",
    "the number of eas events selected was 43710 at @xmath23 eev .",
    "the energy estimation error was approximately @xmath24 for the showers with axes within the array area @xcite .",
    "the systematic error in the energy estimation procedure of the yakutsk array , as in the case of other giant arrays , could be corrected by a specific factor @xcite .",
    "[ fig : eqfig ] shows the distribution of arrival directions of selected showers in the equatorial system compared with expected isotropic distributions .",
    "we used the rayleigh formalism in harmonic analysis of the @xmath0 distribution of cr arrival directions @xcite .",
    "if the large - scale anisotropy is present in the arrival directions of crs , it can be expressed using the anisotropy coefficient for the intensity variation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the maximum and minimum of cr intensity , respectively , as a function of the arrival angle , @xmath28 . in the simplest cases with one source at @xmath29 ( for example , @xmath26 from the galactic center , @xmath27 from the anticenter )",
    ", the distribution can be described by a cosine wave @xmath30 , or with the two opposing sources as @xmath31 ( for example , @xmath26 from the galactic arm `` in '' and `` out '' directions , while @xmath27 is from perpendicular directions ) . in the first case ,",
    "the coefficient is denoted @xmath32 , which is the amplitude of the first harmonic , and in the second case , the coefficient is denoted @xmath33 , which is the amplitude of the second harmonic . in the general case of harmonic expansion of an arbitrary distribution : @xmath34 if the observed distribution of arrival angles , @xmath35 , is given by a sum of delta functions @xmath36 , then @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "average values of the amplitudes are not zero even in the case of isotropic distribution , and converge to zero with @xmath39 ( see appendix a ) : @xmath40 the probability that isotropic amplitudes will be larger than the given @xmath41 is @xmath42    earth s rotation enables celestial regions to be represented as @xmath0 distributions .",
    "scintillation counters of the yakutsk array have a 24-hour duty cycle , resulting in almost uniform directional exposure .",
    "small deviations from the uniformity are caused by maintenance of the detectors ( mainly during working days ) and summertime shutdowns of the array due to thunderstorms .",
    "diurnal and seasonal variations of the array exposure and atmospheric conditions result in spurious amplitude @xmath43 @xcite . with datasets of the size described in section 2",
    ", we were able to determine only those amplitudes that were well above @xmath44 ( eq .",

    "we estimated the most probable @xmath47 parameters fitting the data from table 2 in the energy range @xmath48 eev .",
    "the results showed that the ss position is @xmath49 , and the ratio of cr flux from ss to the total flux is @xmath50 .",
    "we used two methods to examine the @xmath0 distribution of cr arrival directions measured with the yakutsk array : harmonic analysis and analysis of variance .",
    "resultant first and second harmonic amplitudes increased with energy but were consistent with expected amplitudes of the isotropic distribution .",
    "in the energy range @xmath51 eev , our data observed in the period 19742000 exhibited an excess flux with the first harmonic amplitude of @xmath52 , a chance probability of @xmath53 , but the second part of the data observed in 20002008 had the amplitude @xmath54 with a chance probability of @xmath55 . therefore , we found no significant deviation of the first and second harmonic amplitudes from those in the isotropic distribution , providing a hint of possible anisotropy above @xmath56 eev .",
    "analysis of variance demonstrated the prominent excess in the same energy bin , namely , a significant contraction of the minimal width of the @xmath0 distribution of cr arrival directions with respect to the isotropic distribution . downsizing in width was found in both independent parts of the yakutsk array data , i.e. , data observed before and after 2000 .",
    "the null hypothesis was rejected at the significance level @xmath57 . an alternative hypothesis with a single source in the uniform background flux of crs",
    "was fitted to the observational data in the energy range @xmath48 eev with the source position @xmath3 and the ratio of cr flux from ss to the total flux @xmath50 .",
    "the first harmonic phase did not appear to be randomly distributed in the interval @xmath58 , as would be expected in the isotropic case , but exhibited a gradual increase with energy in @xmath0 , at least in the energy interval above @xmath59 eev .",
    "this behavior is inherent in both yakutsk observation periods , i.e. , before and after 2000 , and is in agreement with the possible regularity in the phase of the dipole anisotropy observed by the pao and ta collaborations .",

    "here , we apply the rayleigh formalism , founded in @xcite , to illustrate a calculation of the first harmonic amplitude , @xmath32 , for @xmath60 isotropic points in the interval @xmath61 .    treating the amplitude as a sum of @xmath60 vectors of length @xmath62 with angle @xmath35 , we have the total length , @xmath63 , which accumulates @xmath60 equal random steps .",
