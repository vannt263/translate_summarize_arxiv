    "<S> the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator in a box problem is used to introduce the concept of an oblique - basis shell - model theory . </S>",

    "<S> other alternative basis sets are considered for future oblique - basis shell - model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that an oblique - basis , mixed - symmetry shell - model theory may prove to be useful in situations where competing degrees of freedom dominate the dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> two dominate but often competing modes characterize the structure of atomic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> one is the single - particle shell structure underpinned by the validity of the mean - field concept ; the other is the many - particle collective behavior manifested through nuclear deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the spherical shell model is the theory of choice when single - particle behavior dominates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when deformation dominates , the elliott su(3 ) model can be used successfully @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this manifests itself in two dominant elements in the nuclear hamiltonian : the single - particle term , @xmath4 , and a collective quadrupole - quadrupole interaction , @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> the use of two sets of basis vectors , one representing each of the two limits , has physical appeal , especially at energies near @xmath22 one basis set consists of the harmonic oscillator states ; </S>",

    "<S> this observation is demonstrated in the right graph of fig.[ho1dbox potential and spectrum ] which shows the relative deviations from the exact energy spectrum for a particle in a box .    </S>",
    "<S> although the spectrum seems to be well described using first order perturbation theory based on particle in a box wave functions , the exact wave functions near @xmath13 have an interesting structure . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the zero order approximation to the wave function used to calculate the energy may not be present at all in the structure of the exact wave function as is the case shown in the left graph of fig.[coherent mixing ] . </S>",
    "<S> another feature also seen in fig.[coherent mixing ] is the common shape of the distribution of the non - zero components along the particle in a box basis . the right graph of fig.[coherent </S>",

    "<S> the results shown in fig.[mg24oblique ] were obtained in a space that spans less than 10% of the full - space . </S>",
    "<S> they reproduce , within 2% of the full - space result , the correct binding energy as well as the low - energy spectrum and the dominate structure of the states that have greater than 90% overlap with the full - space results . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for a @xmath26-scheme spherical shell - model calculation one needs about 60% of the full space to obtain results comparable with the oblique basis results .    </S>",
    "<S> studies of the lower @xmath1-shell nuclei @xmath27 and @xmath18 @xcite , using the realistic kuo - brown-3 ( kb3 ) interaction @xcite , show strong su(3 ) symmetry breaking due mainly to the single - particle spin - orbit splitting . </S>",
    "<S> thus the kb3 hamiltonian could also be considered a two - mode system . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by the behavior of the yrast band b(e2 ) values that seems to be insensitive to fragmentation of the su(3 ) symmetry . specifically , the quadrupole collectivity as measured by the b(e2 ) strengths remains high even though the su(3 ) symmetry is rather badly broken . </S>",
    "<S> this has been attributed to a quasi - su(3 ) symmetry @xcite where the observables behave like a pure su(3 ) symmetry while the true eigenvectors exhibit a strong coherent structure with respect to each of the two bases . </S>",
    "<S> this provides strong justification for further study of the implications of two - mode shell - model studies .    </S>",
    "<S> future research may provide justification for an extension of the theory to multi - mode oblique shell - model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> an immediate extension of the current scheme might use the eigenvectors of the pairing interaction @xcite within the sp(4 ) algebraic approach to the nuclear structure @xcite , together with the collective su(3 ) states and spherical shell model states . </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonian driven basis sets can also be considered . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the method may use eigenstates of the very - near closed shell nuclei obtained from a full shell - model calculation to form hamiltonian driven j - pair states for mid - shell nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this type of extension would mimic the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite and the so - called broken - pair theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the three exact limits of the ibm @xcite can be considered to comprise a three - mode system . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the real benefit of this approach is expected when the system is far away of any exactly solvable limit of the hamiltonian and the spaces encountered are too large to allow for exact calculations . </S>"
