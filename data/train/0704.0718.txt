    "there is the expectation that in the near future we will see the opening of the new field of observational high energy neutrino astronomy @xcite .",
    "theoretically there are very robust reasons to expect the existence of high energy ( @xmath0  ev ) neutrino sources .",
    "the strongest motivation is the observation of a cosmic ray flux , mostly composed of protons and fully ionized nuclei that extends in energy up to @xmath1  ev .",
    "these hadronic particles can interact inside or near their acceleration sites or during their propagation in interstellar or intergalactic space .",
    "these interactions produce weakly decaying particles ( such as @xmath2 and kaons ) that generate neutrinos .",
    "these `` astrophysical neutrinos '' are intimately connected with the high energy photons that are created in the decay of @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles produced in the same hadronic primaries interactions , or in the radiation processes of relativistic electrons and positrons co  accelerated in the sources .",
    "a rich variety of high energy gamma ray sources has been observed with detectors on satellites @xcite and ground  based @xcite cherenkov telescopes , suggesting several possible neutrino sources .",
    "observations with neutrinos have the potential to give us unique information about their astrophysical sources , and hopefully could also result in the discovery of new classes of sources . on the other hand",
    "the possibility to use these observations to obtain information about the fundamental properties of the neutrinos has been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "astrophysical neutrinos travel pathlengths of order @xmath5  kpc ( @xmath6  cm ) for galactic sources , and as large as @xmath7  gpc ( @xmath8  cm ) for extragalactic sources .",
    "these remarkably long baselines allow the study of phenomena such as @xmath9 flavor transitions or @xmath9 decay in a range of parameters that is unaccessible with other methods . only observations with supernova neutrinos , very likely only observable from galactic sources , but having much smaller energy ( @xmath10  mev ) could provide larger @xmath11 .    in order to extract information about the neutrino fundamental properties from the observations one needs to have sufficiently good understanding of the properties of the neutrino emission at the source .",
    "the common assumption in several studies of this type is that the properties of the @xmath9 emission , and in particular the flavor composition at the source can be robustly predicted .",
    "there is of course a well known historical precedent for the successful use of this concept in the discovery of neutrino oscillations with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "in fact , the first hints of the existence of the now solidly established @xmath12 transitions were obtained with the kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite detectors as the measurement of a @xmath13 ratio for contained events smaller than the expectations .",
    "it is natural to try to make use of new , very distant neutrino sources ( when they will be discovered ) to perform additional studies of the properties of neutrino propagation .",
    "several `` exotic '' processes , beyond standard flavor oscillations , could reveal themselves only in the propagation of neutrinos over very long distances .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that some neutrinos could decay into a lighter neutrino and a majoron @xcite , if the lifetime is sufficiently long this phenomenon could be only detectable for neutrinos propagating over astronomical distances @xcite .",
    "a second interesting possibility is that neutrinos are pseudo  dirac states @xcite where each generation is actually composed of two maximally - mixed majorana neutrinos separated by a tiny mass difference . if the pseudo - dirac splittings are sufficiently small , the phenomenology of oscillations on short baselines remains unchanged , however when @xmath14 becomes comparable or smaller than the pseudo  dirac splittings new transitions become possible , and can in principle be detectable with astrophysical neutrinos @xcite .",
    "more in general , oscillations into sterile states that are quasi degenerate to the active neutrinos can in principle be investigated down to very small squared mass splittings @xcite .",
    "several other mechanisms such as quantum decoherence @xcite , violations of the equivalence principle @xcite , neutrinos with varying masses @xcite could leave their signature on the propagation of astrophysical neutrinos .    a well known `` naive '' argument",
    "states that since the dominant source of astrophysical neutrinos is the decay of charged pions , and each @xmath2 , after chain decays such as : @xmath15 , generates two muon neutrinos and one electron neutrino , the flavor ratio at the source is @xmath16 .",
    "this naive argument has some pedagogical value , but must be considered only as a first approximation .",
    "in fact , even if charged pions are the only source of neutrinos , @xmath17 is only equal to 2 after integration over all @xmath9 energies , because the three neutrinos generated in a charged pion decay have different energy spectra , and therefore in general the flavor ratio will depend on the spectral shape of the @xmath9 signal , and will vary with the neutrino energy .",
    "an effect that can be of large importance is the presence of sufficiently efficient energy loss mechanisms in the source . in this situation the particles that are most affected",
    "are the muons .",
    "the presence of additional neutrino sources ( such as kaons ) can also be important for the flavor ratio . in this work we will re  examine critically the uncertainties in the predictions of the spectra and flavor composition of astrophysical neutrinos and discuss the implications for the extraction of information on the neutrino properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss how the observable neutrino flavor ratios carry information at the same time about the flavor composition at the source and about the flavor transition probabilities .",
    "in section  3 we outline the general structure of the calculation of the neutrino signal from an astrophysical source .",
    "the different steps of these calculations are considered in more details in sections 47 . in section  8 , as an illustration , we describe an explicit calculation of the neutrino emission from the fireballs of gamma ray bursts following the model of waxman and bahcall @xcite . section  9 contains a short discussion of the problem of the experimental determination of the flavor composition and energy spectra of a neutrino signal .",
    "the last section presents our conclusions .",
    "the observable fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos from a source at distance @xmath18 will be linear combinations of the fluxes at the source .",
    "leaving implicit the energy and distance dependences one can write : @xmath19 the transition probabilities @xmath20 have certainly a non trivial structure because of the known existence of `` standard '' flavor oscillations , but might depend on additional `` new physics '' contributions , such as neutrino decay , that become significant only for very long pathlengths . in the standard scenario the neutrino number is conserved and therefore @xmath21 .",
    "more in general , in the presence of a non negligible decay probability or of transitions to additional sterile states , the sum can be less than unity .    the flavor , energy and pathlength dependences of the standard oscillation probabilities are well known , and are determined by two squared mass differences ( @xmath22  ev@xmath23 , @xmath24  ev@xmath23 ) and the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the oscillation lengths ( @xmath25 ) of the standard flavor transitions are short with respect to the typical astrophysical distances and , in most cases , it is a good approximation to consider only the probability averaged over distance . in this case",
    "the probability becomes independent from @xmath26 and @xmath18 and takes the form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unitary mixing matrix that relates the neutrino flavor and mass eigenstates .",
    "this matrix can be written in terms of three mixing angles and one cp violating phase . from a global fit to all existing neutrino data @xcite one can extract the best fit values : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and 99% c.l .",
    "intervals for the mixing angles : @xmath32 $ ] , @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath34 ; the phase @xmath35 remains completely undetermined .",
    "assuming to know sufficiently well the properties of the source , the observed flavor ratios can give information on the flavor transition probabilities .",
    "this can be used to help in the determination of the `` standard '' parameters in the flavor oscillations , or more ambitiously to investigate the possible existence of additional phenomena in neutrino propagation .    as an illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : flav1 ] and [ fig : flav2 ] we show the expectations for the two independent flavor ratios @xmath36 and @xmath37 , calculated for different assumptions for the source emission , in the presence of simple standard oscillations , or also including neutrino decay ( with two different assumptions ) @xcite .",
    "the distributions of the flavor ratio for a given model are determined only by the present uncertainties on the neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "a source model is defined by the relative intensity of the emission for the three neutrino flavors . for our illustration",
    "we have considered three source models .",
    "the first model is the emission of form : [ @xmath38_{\\rm source } = [ 1,1.86,0]$ ] .",
    "this corresponds ( as we will discuss more extensively in the following ) to pion dominated emission from a thin source ( no significant energy loss for secondaries ) with a power law energy spectrum of slope 2 .",
    "several classes of @xmath9 sources of this type ( such as supernova remnants and gamma ray bursts ) have been predicted .",
    "note that the flavor relative abundances in this model are close but not identical to the naive expectation [ 1,2,0 ] .",
    "the deviations are a simple consequence of the shape of the energy spectra of the neutrinos in pion chain decay .",
    "the observable @xmath39 ratio for this model takes value in the interval @xmath40 with a most likely value close to unity , while the other independent ratio @xmath41 has a narrow distribution sharply peaked at the value 1 , with a tail extending up to @xmath42",
    ".    figures  [ fig : flav1 ] and  [ fig : flav2 ] also show the predicted flavor ratios for emission with ( summing over @xmath9 and @xmath43 ) flavor abundances @xmath44 $ ] , and @xmath45 $ ] , that is pure muon or electron neutrino emission .",
    "the motivation for using these two models is that , to a very good approximation , they can be considered the two extreme models for the emission from a `` standard '' ( not involving new physics ) source , since a significant production of @xmath46 in an astrophysical environment is extraordinary unlikely .",
    "sources emitting pure fluxes of @xmath47 or @xmath48 are in principle possible , and have been in fact advocated in the literature .",
    "they correspond to a source dominated by pions where muons lose all their energy before decay , or to a pure neutron source , that generates a @xmath49 flux . a pure neutron ( @xmath49 ) neutrino source is in fact unrealistic since it is natural that neutron production is associated with pion production and therefore with some @xmath47 emission .",
    "we will comment more extensively on these issues in the following .",
    "for the [ 0,1,0 ] ( [ 1,0,0 ] ) model the most likely value for the observable flavor ratio is @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) . in both cases",
    "@xmath41 is centered at the value unity , this is a simple consequence of the large ( approximately maximal ) mixing between @xmath47 and @xmath46 . in the case of a [ 1,0,0 ]",
    "source the @xmath41 distribution is noticeably broader extending to the interval @xmath52 .",
    "neutrino decay with a very long lifetime is one of the most interesting possibilities that can be investigated with astrophysical neutrinos . assuming @xcite that only the lowest mass eigenstate is stable , and that the distance of the source is much longer than the decay lengths , the observable flavor ratios depend uniquely on the flavor composition of the lightest eigenstate .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath53 this is @xmath54 ( direct mass hierarchy ) or @xmath55 ( inverse hierarchy ) .",
    "the flavor ratios for these two models are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flav1 ] and  [ fig : flav2 ] as dashed lines .",
    "the @xmath56 ratio is particularly interesting . in the case of direct mass hierarchy ,",
    "the most probable value of the @xmath57 ratio is large ( @xmath58 ) , the distribution is also remarkably wide , allowing in principle to constrain the mixing parameters @xcite . for the inverse hierarchy ,",
    "when the stable neutrino is the @xmath55 that has a small ( or perhaps vanishing ) overlap with @xmath48 , the observable @xmath56 is close to zero .",
    "it is remarkable that the predictions for the @xmath57 flavor ratio in neutrino decay are in both ( direct and inverse mass hierarchy ) models significantly different from the standard model predictions for nearly all assumptions about the flavor composition of the emission .",
    "only a pure @xmath48 emission has some overlap with the decay model with stable @xmath54 .",
    "the study of the @xmath57 flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos can therefore give evidence in favor or against the existence of @xmath9 decay .",
    "the determination of the neutrino mixing parameters in the standard oscillation scenario is more problematic . for the most sensitive @xmath57 ratio , the range of possible values due to the present uncertainties on the mixing parameters",
    "is in fact smaller than the variations that result from different flavor abundances at the source .",
    "therefore the possibility to obtain interesting bounds on the mixing parameters depends crucially on having a sufficiently precise knowledge of the source .      in the remaining sections of this paper",
    "we will discuss how the properties of the astrophysical sources determine the flavor abundances of their emission , and estimate the associated theoretical uncertainties .",
    "astrophysical neutrinos are generated when a population of relativistic hadrons ( protons or nuclei ) interacts with some target material ( gas or a radiation field ) inside , near , or outside the acceleration site .",
    "these interactions produce weakly decaying secondary particles whose decay generate neutrinos either directly , or indirectly with the subsequent decay of muons .",
    "the description of these processes therefore requires the following elements :    1 .   the description of the energy spectrum and composition of the primary particles .",
    "2 .   the definition of the target material with which the primary particles interact . 3 .   the modeling of the properties of particle production in hadronic interactions .",
    "4 .   the description of the properties of the medium where the interactions are taking place , to determine the relevant mechanisms for energy loss .",
    "the ( well known ) properties of weak decays .    in our discussion we will describe the source as one stationary homogeneous region .",
    "this is an important limitation , because in general we can expect that the sources will have non trivial space structures , with the neutrinos emerging from different regions that can produce different spectral shapes and flavor contents ; most high energy radiation sources are also expected to show important time variabilities . because of the limited statistics and angular resolution , the observations of astrophysical neutrinos will necessarily integrate over the entire volume of the source ( that in most cases will appear as point  like ) and average over most or all time variations .",
    "describing this situation requires the averaging over different source regions and conditions .",
    "some of the most interesting postulated sources of neutrinos , in particular the jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , are expected to be associated with astrophysical jets with ultra  relativistic bulk motion .",
    "these relativistically moving sources are best described in the rest frame of the jet , where the emitted radiation is approximately isotropic , and the electromagnetic fields can be described as a purely magnetic field .",
    "the observable fluxes can then be obtained by an appropriate lorentz boost . the @xmath9 emission from a given source can be described by the emissivities @xmath68 ( in units ( s  sr  gev)@xmath69 ) that give the number of neutrinos of type @xmath70 emitted with energy @xmath26 in the direction @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath9 fluxes at the earth are obtained from the neutrino emissivities as : @xmath72 \\label{eq : q - flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the source luminosity distance , @xmath74 is its redshift , and @xmath75 are the flavor transition probabilities .",
    "the observable fluxes depend only on the emission in the direction @xmath76 that corresponds to the line of sight from the source to the earth . in the following",
    "we will not consider the angular dependence of the source emission , since this is not observable for any individual source .",
    "the calculation of the neutrino emissivities @xmath77 , starts from a decription of the energy spectrum and composition of the primary particles . in the following",
    "we will assume that the primary particles are protons and are described by the energy spectrum @xmath78 ( in units gev@xmath69 ) .",
    "the extension to the case where there is a significant contribution from nuclei is straightforward , and to a very good approximation can be calculated introducing effective proton and neutron spectra ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) that take also into account the bound nucleons .",
    "the description of the environment of the source must include the density and properties of the target material and of all other fields that can be a source of energy loss .",
    "the interactions of the primary particles result in the emission of secondary particles @xmath80 ) that are sources of neutrinos .",
    "these particles must be propagated in the source medium until they decay .",
    "all muons generated by these decays must also be propagated and their decay studied .",
    "the scheme of the calculation is therefore the following .",
    "the rate of production of secondary particle of type @xmath81 can be calculated with the convolution : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the interaction probability per unit time of a proton of energy @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the number of particles of type @xmath81 in the final state in the energy interval ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) .",
    "the energy distribution of particle @xmath81 at decay @xmath88 will in general differ from the distribution at production and can be obtained with the integration : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the probability density that particle @xmath81 created with energy @xmath91 will decay with energy @xmath92 .",
    "the neutrinos created in the _ direct _ decay of particle @xmath81 can be calculated as : @xmath93 folding the parent energy distribution ( at decay ) with the appropriate decay spectra @xmath94 .",
    "the muon production rate can be calculated with an expression that is the analogous of ( [ eq : adec ] ) substituting the appropriate decay distributions : @xmath95 the sum runs over all weakly decaying hadrons .    in out",
    "calculation we explicitely included charged pions , kaons and neutrons , neglecting the much smaller contributions of heavier particles .",
    "an important complication is that the spectra of the particles generated in muon decay depend on the muon helicity ( see discussion in section  [ sec : weak ] ) .",
    "it is therefore convenient to calculate separately the production of muons with different helicity : \\{@xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 } ( where @xmath18 and @xmath100 indicate the helicity ) .",
    "it is expected that the helicity of the muons is to a good approximation conserved even in the presence of a strong magnetic field and of significant energy losses , and therefore the energy distributions of the muon of different helicities at decay can be obtained with a convolution similar to ( [ eq : edec ] ) : @xmath101 the last step is to compute the neutrinos generated by muon decay : @xmath102 the neutrino flux is obtained summing over all possible sources .    in the following sections we will give more details about the neutrino production .",
    "our discussion starts from the neutrinos and goes backward along the chain of processes that lead to their production .",
    "the next section contains a discussion of the decay energy distributions ; after discussing the consequences for exact power law spectra in section  [ sec : power ] , in section  [ sec : pdec ] we will discuss possible mechanisms for energy loss and the calculation of the decay energy distribution ; in section  [ sec : inter ] we will discuss the interaction probability @xmath83 and the properties of particle production in hadronic interactions .",
    "for an accurate prediction of the neutrino fluxes it is necessary to include a precise description of the energy spectra produced in weak decays .",
    "the energy distribution of particle @xmath103 in the decay @xmath104 in the frames where the parent particle @xmath81 is ultrarelativistic , takes the scaling form : @xmath105 the functions @xmath106 for the relevant weak decays are calculable using the measured branching fractions in the possible final states , and their matrix elements .",
    "for the two body decay @xmath107 , that accounts for approximately 100% of charged pion decay , the scaling distributions are fully determined by elementary kinematics : @xmath108 @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the step function and @xmath111 .",
    "it is also necessary to take into account the spin state of the final state muons , that can be described by the helicity @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the probability that the muon has spin parallel ( anti  parallel ) to its momentum .",
    "the helicity , in a frame where the parent pion is ultrarelativistic , is a function of the fractional energy @xmath114 @xcite : @xmath115 because of @xmath116 invariance : @xmath117 the helicity @xmath118 takes the value @xmath119 for @xmath120 ( forward muon emission ) and @xmath121 for @xmath122 ( backward muon emission ) reflecting the fact that the @xmath123 is created as a left  handed particle in the pion rest frame in order to compensate the angular monentum of a left  handed neutrino .",
    "a useful method to take into account the effect of muon polarization in the presence of energy loss for the muons is to consider separately the production of left  handed and right  handed muons , that have two well determined decay spectra . combining equations ( [ eq : pimu ] ) and ( [ eq : pol ] ) one obtains the distributions : @xmath124 @xmath125 because of cp invariance one has : @xmath126 .",
    "the above discussion is also valid for the decay mode @xmath127 ( and charge conjugate ) , with the simple replacement @xmath128 .",
    "the scaling functions that describe the decay of a muon of helicity @xmath129 are : @xmath130 @xmath131 because of @xmath116 invariance the spectra for the charged conjugate decays are obtained with the replacement @xmath132 .",
    "the spectra for unpolarized muons can be obtained setting @xmath133 .    if the muon energy loss before decay is negligible , it is straightforward to convolute the previous expressions to obtain the @xmath9 spectra after a chain decay ( @xmath134 ) or ( @xmath135 ) . in the more general case",
    "the energy loss of the muon must be taken into account .",
    "the energy spectra of neutrinos and muons emitted in the three body decays of kaons ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) can be written in terms of vector form factors that have been experimentally determined @xcite .",
    "neutrons are also a source of @xmath49 .",
    "the energy spectrum of these neutrinos is also well known .",
    "the @xmath49 carry a very small fraction of the parent neutron energy and are negligible in most ( but not all ) cases .",
    "several works on the fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos make simplifying assumptions about the energy distributions of the neutrinos produced in weak decays .",
    "for example the calculation of kashti and waxman @xcite approximates the decay spectra of charged pions and muons into muons and neutrinos as : @xmath138\\ ] ] @xmath139\\ ] ] @xmath140\\ ] ] these approximations , together with the assumption that muon energy loss before decay is negligible , imply that a @xmath9 source dominated by pions has a flavor ratio ( @xmath141 . with the use of the correct expressions ( [ eq : pimu1 ] ) , ( [ eq : pimu2 ] ) , ( [ eq : mudec2 ] ) and ( [ eq : mudec3 ] ) for the decay spectra one obtains the result that even for a pure pion source the flavor ratio is not exactly two , and is in general a function of the @xmath9 energy determined by the shape of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "the situation where the neutrino energy spectrum is a power law of form @xmath142 is phenomenologically very important , and is simple to discuss .",
    "a power law @xmath9 spectrum implies that the spectrum of the parent particles ( pions and kaons ) is also a power law with the same slope ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "such a spectrum arises when the interacting primary particles have a power law spectrum and the target is either composed of normal matter at rest , or is a photon field with an energy distribution that has again a power law form . in the first case",
    "the slope of the secondary particles spectrum is equal to the one for the primary particles ( @xmath144 ) ; in the second case the slope of the secondaries is @xmath145 where @xmath146 the slope of the primary particles and @xmath147 the slope of the target photon distribution ( @xmath148 ) .    in general the spectrum of neutrinos produced in the decay of particle type @xmath81",
    "can be obtained convoluting the energy spectrum of the parent particles with the appropriate weak decay spectrum ( see equation ( [ eq : adec ] ) ) .",
    "if the parent particle spectrum has a power law form , because of the scaling form ( [ eq : dec_scaling ] ) of the decay spectra the resulting neutrino energy distribution can be written as : @xmath149 in other words the neutrino spectrum is a power law with the same slope of the parent particles , with a proportionality factor that is commonly called the `` @xmath150factor '' , and is the momentum of order @xmath151 of the decay spectrum : @xmath152 @xmath153 is the average multiplicity of @xmath154 in the final state , and @xmath155 is the fraction of the parent particle energy carried away by neutrinos of type @xmath156 .    in the case of @xmath2 chain decay",
    "the three relevant @xmath150factors are : @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 with @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath150factors for charged conjugate modes are identical because of @xmath116 invariance .",
    "the @xmath150factors given above are calculated neglecting the energy loss of muons before decay , and assuming that the muon helicity is exactly conserved .",
    "this assumption remains valid , to a very good approximation , also in the presence of a magnetic field , because the bending of the momentum and the spin precession exactly cancel for a particle of electric charge @xmath160 and magnetic moment of one  bohr magneton .",
    "neglecting the effects of the muon polarization leads to an overestimate ( underestimate ) of the @xmath150factor for the @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) channel .",
    "for @xmath163 the @xmath150factors for pion decay take the values : @xmath164 i.e. the three neutrinos carry approximately one quarter of the charged pion energy .",
    "this happens because in the first decay the muon carries away a large fraction ( @xmath165 ) of the pion energy .",
    "because of the different shapes of the energy distributions of the three neutrinos emitted in a pion decay , the flavor ratio @xmath166 for a power law spectrum of parent pions is a function of its slope .",
    "the ratio is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z ] . for @xmath167 one",
    "has @xmath168 , since in this case the @xmath150 factors correspond to the neutrino multiplicities .",
    "with increasing @xmath70 the flavor ratio decreases monotonically , this reflects the fact that the muon neutrinos produced in the direct pion decay are softer than the neutrinos of the muon decay .",
    "for the value @xmath169 one has @xmath170 .",
    "figure  [ fig : z ] also shows the predictions obtained neglecting the effects of muon polarization to illustrate the importance of their inclusion .",
    "the second most important source of neutrinos is the decay of kaons .",
    "charged kaons can produce neutrinos with three different decay channels : the two body mode @xmath171 ( with branching ratio 0.6343 ) , and the three body modes @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) and @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) that have branching ratios @xmath176 and @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath178 can also produce neutrinos in the @xmath179 decay mode ( @xmath180 ) with combined branching ratio @xmath181 , and @xmath182 mode ( @xmath183 ) with combined branching ratio @xmath184 .",
    "the @xmath17 ratios for neutrinos produced by the chain decay of charged or neutral kaons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z1 ] . in the case of charged kaons",
    "the 2body decay mode is the dominant one , the @xmath150factors for this mode have the same form as in pion decay , with the replacement @xmath185 , however for charged kaons the flavor ratio grows when @xmath70 increases , reflecting the fact that the muon neutrinos produced in the direct decay carry nearly half ( @xmath186 ) of the parent particle energy while the neutrinos produced in the second stage ( from muon decay ) take on average only 18% ( @xmath47 ) and 16% ( @xmath48 ) of the kaon energy .",
    "the inclusion of the three body decay modes ( @xmath172 and @xmath187 ) that have smaller branching fractions reduces the flavor ratio , but it is a small correction .    in the case of the decay of @xmath178 ,",
    "the three body decays are the only source of neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath188 mode has a larger branching fraction than the @xmath189 channel , because of the larger phase space available . when @xmath190 , when the flavor ratio reflects the neutrino multiplicities in the final state , the flavor ratio is @xmath191 .",
    "increasing @xmath70 the ratio decreases , because the @xmath48 from the @xmath188 decay have the hardest spectrum , and their contribution is enhanced .",
    "note that for power laws with slope @xmath192 the net effect of including kaon decay as a @xmath9 source is a only a small ( positive ) correction , because of a cancellation between the contributions of charged kaons ( that increase the relative importance of muon neutrinos ) and neutral kaons ( that do the opposite ) .",
    "in the most general case , the unstable particles that create neutrinos can lose a significant amount of energy during the time that elapses from the moment of their creation to the moment of their decay .",
    "this effect can have very important consequences for the spectrum and flavor composition of the neutrinos .    as an illustration ,",
    "muon energy losses are very important for the prediction of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes .",
    "the largest effect is due to the fact that the muons that reach the ground lose rapidly energy because of ionization and electromagnetic radiation processes , and decay practically at rest ( or are captured by heavy nuclei @xcite ) producing only very low energy neutrinos .",
    "pion energy losses are also very important for the calculation of the atmospheric @xmath9 fluxes . in this case the dominant mechanism for energy loss are hadronic interactions in air .",
    "the pion decay length grows linearly with @xmath193 , and ( for @xmath194  gev ) it becomes ( for vertical particles ) comparable to the interaction length .",
    "most pions of higher energy interact before decaying .",
    "these hadronic interactions result in a multiplication of the pions , but the secondary particles have much lower energy and the net effect is a strong suppression of the neutrino flux at high energy .",

    "the description of the emission of neutrinos from grb that we have used in this section following reference @xcite is very simplified , and could be improved in many aspects .",
    "the results of our calculation show that one obtains non trivial and intriguing energy dependences of the flavor ratios , that could reveal important informations about the source .",
    "this qualitative observation is of a much more general validity and one expects that in most cases , and also using more realistic descriptions of the sources , one should find non trivial structures in the energy spectra and flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino signals .",
    "in this work we will not consider in detail the crucial problem of the experimental determination of the flavor ratios .",
    "several experimental approaches for the detection are at present being developed .",
    "the concept that is in the most advanced stage is a large volume ( cubic kilometer ) ice or water cherenkov detector , with photon detectors distributed inside the volume , as originally proposed by the dumand group @xcite and now in different stages of development at the south pole @xcite , in the baikal lake @xcite and in the mediterranean sea @xcite .",
    "several other alternative techiques are also being developed @xcite , that includes radio @xcite , acoustic and air shower @xcite detection methods .",
    "a very imporant problem is of course the amount of data that is required in order to reduce the statistical errors to the level needed for a meaningful measurement .",
    "today we only have upper limits for the astrophysical neutrino fluxes , optimistically one can expect that these fluxes will be soon discovered just below the current upper limits , however even in this case the event rates will remain small , and one will need very long data taking periods , or much larger mass detectors to collect sufficient data @xcite .    in this section",
    "we want to stress the point that in all the experimental methods that are envisaged , the measurement of the flavor ratio is connected with a determination of ( or a theoretical assumption on ) the shape of the energy distribution of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "this happens because the detection methods of different neutrino flavors have efficiencies with different dependences on @xmath26 .",
    "if the statistical errors are sufficiently small ( with very large mass detectors ) , and having achieved perfect control of the detector acceptances and efficiencies , the uncertainties in the determination of the neutrino spectral shapes will remain as the dominant source of error in the measurement of the flavor ratios .    to illustrate the interplay between the spectral shapes and the determination of the flavor ratio one can consider the case of the km@xmath426 type cherenkov telescopes . in these detectors",
    "one expects to find different classes of neutrino induced events @xcite .    * in `` track events '' a single up  going muon is seen entering the detector .",
    "the energy of the muons can be estimated from the amount of cherenkov light produced by the photons and @xmath427 pairs radiated from the muon track . * in `` shower events '' one observes the release of a large amount of cherenkov light generated by the shower induced by a neutrino interaction in the detector volume .",
    "the amount of light can be translated in the estimate of a visible energy release @xmath428 .",
    "* in `` double bang events '' @xcite one detects two distinct energy releases inside the detector volume , with space and time separations that are consistent with the propagation and decay of an energetic tau lepton .",
    "events in class ( i ) are associated with the charged current ( cc ) interactions of muon neutrinos below the detector .",
    "events in class ( ii ) can be produced by several types of neutrino interactions .",
    "electron ( anti)neutrino cc interactions are the main source of shower events , there are also contributions from the neutral current interactions of all neutrino types , and in general also from the cc interactions of @xmath47 and @xmath46",
    ". finally events in class ( iii ) are generated by @xmath46 cc interactions .",
    "clearly , the ratio of the frequencies of these three classes of events does give information about the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "in fact the ratio of the event rates for `` shower '' and `` tracks '' events has been proposed as the best method for a measurement of the @xmath429 flavor ratio .",
    "the frequency of `` track '' events can be studied as a function of the visible muon energy @xmath430 .",
    "the differential event rate can be calculated as : @xmath431 where @xmath432 is the detector effective area for the detection of muons with energy @xmath430 from the direction @xmath76 , @xmath433 is the `` muon yield '' , that is the probability that a @xmath47 ( @xmath415 ) of energy @xmath26 produces a @xmath434 of energy @xmath430 at the detector . in this equation",
    "we have assumed that the muon and the neutrino are collinear .",
    "even for an individual source , the energy spectrum will depend on the zenith angle @xmath435 , because of the effects of neutrino absorption in the earth .",
    "this procedure hower implies a good understanding of the neutrino energy spectrum .      from ( [ eq : tracks ] ) and ( [ eq : showers ] ) it is clear that the energy response for the two classes of events is different , with the `` track '' events selecting larger @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the ratio for the integral rates for `` shower '' and `` tracks '' events is strongly dependent on the spectral shape of the fluxes .",
    "use of the differential distributions in @xmath430 and @xmath428 allows in principle to unfold the shape of the neutrino energy spectra , however an important difficulty is that a narrow interval in the muon energy @xmath430 ( that can however be measured only with modest resolution ) corresponds to a very broad interval in @xmath26 .",
    "also @xmath428 in shower events is not in a one to one correspondence with @xmath26 .",
    "the unfolding procedure has therefore some significant limitations .    as an illustration of these problems",
    ", one can look back at the original discovery of neutrino oscillations @xcite with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the evidence collected by the sk @xcite experiment for subgev fully contained events ( @xmath439  gev ) implied comparing the ratio of the observed rates of @xmath196like and @xmath440like events with a mc prediction @xmath441 .",
    "this prediction is significantly smaller than the no  oscillation ratio @xmath442 for the combination of several reasons , related to the difference in detector acceptances for @xmath196like and @xmath440like events .",
    "the experimental cuts select for the @xmath196like events a broader energy range , both at the low and high energy ends ( at low energy because electrons have a larger yield of cherenkov photons , and at high energy because electrons have a shorter range and are more easily contained ) .",
    "for this reason the mc prediction does depend on the shape of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "for these sub  gev events , the intervals of @xmath26 for the two classes of @xmath196like and @xmath440like events are very similar , and therefore the associated systematic uncertainty in the @xmath443 prediction is relatively small , but it remains as a relevant source of error .",
    "the comparison of the rates of classes of events that correspond to very different atmospheric neutrino energy , such as samples of fully contained @xmath196like events and upgoing muons ( that are produced by @xmath47 charged current interaction with a median energy of order 100  gev ) also allows in principle to verify the existence of @xmath12 transitions .",
    "however in this case the systematic uncertainty in the prediction of the shape of the energy distribution is much larger , and in practice this method gives only marginal evidence for the existence of a suppression of the upgoing muon rate .    in conclusion ,",
    "the extraction of the @xmath444 flavor ratio from the comparison of the rates of `` track '' and `` shower '' events in high energy neutrino telescopes requires excellent control of the detector performances , and a sufficiently precise knowledge of the shapes of the neutrino spectra .",
    "the determination of these shapes could be obtained from the data themselves ( the `` unfolding method '' ) or with the help of reliable theoretical models for the source . in both cases",
    "the task appears as remarkably difficult .",
    "the study of astrophysical neutrinos can be used for two distinct goals : the understanding of their sources and the investigations of the neutrino properties .",
    "these two goals are in a sense contradictory .",
    "the investigation of the neutrino fundamental properties requires a comparison of the observations with expectations that must necessarily be based on a sufficiently accurate understanding of the source . on the other hand the flavor composition of a neutrino signal encodes information about the source properties , but in order to extract this information one needs to know the properties of flavor transitions over galactic or cosmological distances with sufficient accuracy .",
    "several recent works @xcite have speculated that it is possible to discovery new neutrino properties , or even measure precisely the parameters of the already established standard oscillations @xcite from the observation of future astrophysical neutrino sources assuming that the flavor ratios at the source are robustly predictable .",
    "the often repeated argument is that a `` standard neutrino source '' is dominated by charged pion decay , and therefore emits the different flavors ( summing over @xmath9 and @xmath43 ) with relative intensities : [ @xmath445 \\simeq [ 1 , 2 , 0]$ ] .",
    "this statement however must be understood as a first approximation of only limited validity .",
    "first of all it requires that the energy losses of the muons created in charged pion decay are negligible .",
    "this crucial assumption is satisfied for several but not all of the proposed neutrino sources . even for `` thin environment sources '' ( where the density of ordinary matter and magnetic field is sufficiently low so that the energy losses for all secondary unstable particles can be safely neglected ) the flavor ratios are ( slowly varying ) functions of the neutrino energy , with values that are determined by the shape of the neutrino spectra and by the nature of target material .",
    "this dependence arises from two effects : the first is that in general the contributions of other weakly decaying particles ( kaons and in some cases also neutrons ) is not negligible , the second is that , even if charged pions are the only significant neutrino source , the three neutrinos that are emitted in a @xmath2 chain decay have different energy spectra .",
    "folding these decay spectra with the energy distribution of the parent particles , one obtains slightly different shapes , and therefore energy dependent flavor ratios .",
    "in the special case where the parent pion spectrum is a power law , the neutrino energy distributions have also a power law form with the same slope , and the @xmath9 flavor ratios are constants . as a ( phenomenologically important ) example , the neutrino fluxes with spectrum @xmath446 emerging from a `` thin '' , charged pion source , have relative intensity ( at the source ) [ @xmath445 \\simeq [ 1 , 1.86 , 0]$ ] , a 7% deviation from the naive expectation .    in general , the combined effects of different shapes for the @xmath9 energy spectra , and different contributions of the relevant weakly decaying particles correspond to variations of order 10% of the @xmath429 ratio ( in some special circumstances even larger ) .",
    "the size of these corrections is however comparable to the effects on the observable flavor ratios due to the present uncertainties in the values of the standard oscillation parameters ( for a quantitative illustration of this point see equations ( [ eq : rflav1 ] ) , ( [ eq : rflav2 ] ) and ( [ eq : rflav3 ] ) ) .",
    "the very ambitious program @xcite to attempt a precision measurement of @xmath421 or a determination of @xmath447 with astrophysical neutrinos can not therefore ignore these problems , and requires a very precise control of the structure and properties of the neutrino sources .",
    "much larger effects on the neutrino flavor ratio arise from situations where the environment of the source contains large energy densities in magnetic field , or in ordinary matter . in the presence of sufficiently large magnetic fields , such as those that could exist in a grb fireball ,",
    "high energy muons can lose most of their energy to synchrotron radiation @xcite and their contribution to the neutrino fluxes becomes strongly suppressed .",
    "this results in a very small @xmath429 ratio , with a value determined by the size of the kaon contribution ( that generate electron neutrinos in direct decay modes ) . at higher energy",
    "also pions suffer important synchrotron losses , and kaon decay become the dominant @xmath9 source for all flavors . in some extreme circumstances neutral kaon decay will remain as the only significant neutrino source with a @xmath429 ratio at the source of order unity .    in some circumstances it is possible that interactions with ordinary matter play a major rle .",
    "if the density is sufficiently large high energy pions reinteract before decaying .",
    "this supresses the neutrino fluxes and enhances the contribution of kaon decay .",
    "summing over charged and neutral kaons , this also results in a significantly reduced @xmath429 ratio .",
    "the prediction of the neutrino flavor ratios in these circumstances ( strong magnetic field or large densities of ordinary matter ) is going to be very difficult , because the assumption of a `` single volume '' homogeneous source is very likely a poor ( and in any case not demonstrable ) assumption .",
    "the neutrinos will likely emerge with different spectra and flavor ratios from different regions of the source , and for example fitting the data including a value of the field @xmath195 , and/or a matter density @xmath254 is likely to be only a poor approximation .",
    "the existence of neutrino sources dominated by neutron decay are also a theoretical possibility , in situations where photodisintegration of relativistic nuclei interacting on a radiation field is possible while pion photoproduction is kinematically forbidden .",
    "if such sources exist , it will however be very difficult to use these fluxes for studies of the neutrino flavor transitions because in general one expect them to have an important `` contamination '' of muon neutrinos in their initial flavor composition .",
    "in fact it is unnatural to have the pion photoproduction to be absolutely forbidden , because the energy thresholds for nuclear photodisintegration and pion production differ only by one order of magnitude .",
    "the size of the contribution of pion decay to the neutrino fluxes in these circumstances is difficult to control .",
    "even considering all the caveats of our discussion , there are some circumstances where observations of astrophysical neutrinos could lead to the discovery that new physics is involved in the propagation of neutrinos over astrophysical distances .",
    "in particular the investigation of the existence of neutrino decay @xcite is a very attractive possibility .",
    "the observation of the absence ( or very strong suppression ) of a @xmath48 component in the measured fluxes can not be explained with even extreme variations of the source astrophysical properties , and is on the contrary predicted ( for any type of source ) in a neutrino decay model with inverse mass hierarchy . for the normal mass hierarchy",
    "the neutrino decay model predicts a large @xmath448 ratio between 3 and 6 .",
    "if the neutrinos have standard properties , ratios @xmath448 much larger than unity are only possible ( and limited to @xmath449 ) for sources dominated by @xmath48 emission . therefore from the observation of a large @xmath448 ratio it could be possible to infer the existence of @xmath9 decay in the normal mass hierarchy case .",
    "this could require some understanding of the properties of the @xmath9 source .    in the general case the observation of flavor ratios very different from the `` standard source '' values ( relative intensities @xmath450_{\\rm obs } \\sim [ 1,1,1]$ ] ) could be interpreted as evidence for some form of new physics in neutrino propagation , but also , and probably more economically , as an indication of the existence of some unexpected properties in the @xmath9 source .",
    "resolving these ambiguities is in principle possible , but certainly not easy , and requires a careful interpretation of the multi ",
    "messenger ( photons , neutrinos and possibly cosmic rays ) and multi  wavelength observations .",

    "<S> the measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes from astrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only the nature of their emission mechanisms , but also the neutrino fundamental properties . </S>",
    "<S> it is however problematic to reconcile these two goals , since a sufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source is needed to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition and energy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources , and comment on the theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of their structure . </S>"
