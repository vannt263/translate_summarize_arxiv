    "motivated by the recent success on the evidence of stoner ferromagnetism for the repulsive fermi gas in the upper branch of the energy spectrum @xcite , there has been increasing interest in the nature of uncondensed fermi gas ( free of molecules ) within the repulsively interacting regime @xcite , which naturedly becomes the well - controlled platform for simulating landau fermi liquid .",

    "furthermore , the soc give rise to a variety of topological phases , such as the quantum spin hall state and the topological superfluid @xcite .",
    "in addition to the study of soc effect on these symmetry - breaking or topological phases , the normal state contains various potential instabilities and deserves attention .",
    "the consideration of soc systems in the framework of fermi liquid theory is therefore desirable .",
    "as is well known , landau s fermi - liquid theory provides a phenomenological approach to describe the properties of strongly interacting fermions .",

    "following previous studies of landau s fermi - liquid theory including soc @xcite , we are attempted to build a microscopic foundation of phenomenological parameters .",
    "therefore within the framework of random phase approximation ( rpa ) , we derive analytical expressions for the quasi - particle lifetime @xmath1 , the effective mass @xmath6 , and the green s function renormalization factor @xmath3 for a 2d fermi gases with repulsive @xmath0-wave interaction in the presence of rashba soc . to make contact with current experiments directly , we also calculate experimental observable such as spectral weight , density of state and specific heat , and discuss their corresponding experimental signatures .",

    "considering the @xmath0-wave interaction , there is a modification of the quasi - particle dispersion @xmath187 , and a finite lifetime of the quasi - particle @xmath179 corresponding to the imaginary part of the self - energy . in the weakly repulsive regime ,",
    "the polarization of the quasi - particle is hold because of the stability from its non - trivial topology structure , such that we obtain the many - body green s function as @xmath188 based on this form of green s function modified with @xmath0-wave interaction , we could obtain the spectral function in the spin representation , @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the spectral function in the helicity bases representation .",
    "we could find that @xmath191 the elements @xmath192 , @xmath193 are real and equal to each other , while the off - diagonal elements @xmath194 , @xmath194 have an angle dependence @xmath195 , @xmath196 , which is the very effect of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the other qualities such as the density of states at the fermi energy , and the low temperature specific heat are both independent to the representation we use .",
    "therefore they could be compared with experiment straightforwardly ."

    "<S> we investigate normal state properties of spin - orbit coupled fermi gases with repulsive @xmath0-wave interaction , in the absence of molecule formation , i.e. , in the so - called `` upper branch '' . within the framework of random phase approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we derive analytical expressions for the quasi - particle lifetime @xmath1 , the effective mass @xmath2 , and the green s function renormalization factor @xmath3 in the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to spin - orbit coupled electron gas with coulomb interaction , we show that the modifications are dependent on the rashba band index @xmath0 , and occur in the first order of the spin - orbit coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate experimental observable such as spectral weight , density of state and specific heat , which exhibit significant differences from their counterparts without spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we expect our microscopic calculations of these fermi liquid parameters would have the immediate applications to the spin - orbit coupled fermi gases in the upper branch of the energy spectrum . </S>"
