    "the galactic diffuse @xmath0-ray emission is believed to be mostly produced in interactions of cosmic rays with the matter and the radiation fields in the galaxy , the main production mechanisms being electron non - thermal bremsstrahlung , inverse compton scatterings off the radiation fields and pion decay processes in inelastic collisions of nuclei and matter .",
    "although the standard production mechanisms of @xmath0-rays @xcite explain generally well the spatial and energy distribution of the emission below 1 gev , the model does not match egret observations of the @xmath0-ray sky above 1 gev @xcite .",
    "many possible explanations have been proposed to account for the gev excess @xcite . in any case a major difficulty when studying the diffuse emission is to disentangle the truly diffuse emission from that produced by unresolved sources .    the tev diffuse @xmath0-ray emission from the galactic plane @xcite and from the cygnus region @xcite has been measured by milagro , a water cerenkov telescope surveying the northern sky at tev energies @xcite .",
    "the diffuse emission measured by milagro is @xmath1 for @xmath2 tev in the region @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the tev @xmath0-ray diffuse flux is important , as it allows us to calculate what fraction of the emission is produced through inverse compton and what fraction is produced through pion - decay mechanism .",
    "milagro result , which is consistent with egret data above 1 gev , seems to exclude an additional hard spectrum component continuing to above 10 tev to explain the 60 per cent excess of egret flux compared to @xmath4-decay production mechanism due to the local cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite have argued that no strong signal of pion decay is seen in the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "the pion decay mechanism would not be able to explain the excess above 1 gev and the milagro measurements of the diffuse flux at higher energies reveals a new excess at tev energies .",
    "@xcite investigated several possibilities for what might cause the tev excess , among them possible dark matter decay , contribution from unresolved egret sources or sources that are only bright in the tev range .",
    "an extrapolation of the egret sources within the range in galactic longitude of the milagro observation overestimates the diffuse tev flux measured .",
    "however , there could be a population of sources undetectable by egret , but contributing to both the gev and tev excess diffuse emission .",
    "recent observations by the tev observatory , hess , in fact point to a new class of hard spectrum tev sources located close to the galactic plane , within @xmath5 degrees of latitude , whose average slope is about @xmath6 @xcite . the hess detection of high energy @xmath0 rays from fourteen new sources has improved significantly the knowledge of both the spatial distribution and the spectra and fluxes of vhe @xmath0-ray galactic sources .",
    "these hess results make it possible to estimate with unprecedented precision the contribution of unresolved sources to the galactic diffuse emission recently extended to tev energies by milagro .",
    "in fact , the milagro sensitivity to point sources is about @xmath7 and it is of the order of the brightest integral source flux detected by hess .",
    "sources like the ones detected by hess are then unresolved by milagro and contribute to the diffuse emission milagro measures .    here , based on hess results , knowing the sensitivity and the field of view of an experiment",
    ", we estimate the number of expected sources and their expected vhe @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "we then evaluate the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission for milagro .",
    "the estimate of the diffuse emission arising from unresolved sources will be a lower limit .",
    "in fact , hess has mostly detected extended sources . for sources larger than the angular resolution of the experiment",
    "the source size determines the sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "the sensitivity decreases if the extension of the source increases . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the hess source fluxes and the sensitivity as a function of the source extensions are plotted .",
    "a clustering of sources about hess survey sensitivity of 3 percent of the crab flux reported in @xcite is evident , meaning that there are probably many more to be detected with better sensitivity .",
    "hereafter the following notations will be used . in terms of the heliocentric distance @xmath8 , the longitude @xmath9 and the latitude @xmath10 the galactocentric distance , @xmath11 , is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 is the distance from the earth to the galactic center .",
    "the height @xmath15 over the galactic plane is @xmath16    in the inner galaxy region observed by hess the existence of 91 snrs and 389 pulsars was already known at lower energies @xcite .",
    "many of these snrs and pulsars within the inner galaxy might emit vhe @xmath0 rays but only a few @xmath0 ray sources were previously known . although the hess collaboration indicates a clear positional coincidence of its sources with a known snr or pulsar only in a limited number of cases , the distribution of galactic latitude of the seventeen vhe @xmath0 ray sources detected by hess agrees quite well with the distributions of all snrs catalogued by @xcite and of all pulsars catalogued by @xcite . assuming , for example , that snrs are a single class of counterparts with isotropic luminosity @xmath17 to the new hess sources and taking for them a simple radiative model",
    ", @xcite found that the location of these sources favours a scale height of less than 100 pc , consistent with the hypothesis that these sources are either snrs or pulsars in a massive star forming region .",
    "therefore although for only a few of hess sources a firm identification with counterparts at other wavelengths exists , there are some suggestions that many of the hess sources might coincide with supernova remnants ( snrs ) or pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "in fact two of the hess sources have snrs as counterparts , and five of these most recently discovered hess sources are associated with pulsar wind nebulae @xcite .",
    "snrs are an established source class in vhe @xmath0 ray astronomy .",
    "possible correlations between snrs and unidentified egret and hess sources have been proposed since the release of the first egret catalogue @xcite , and later for the third egret catalogue by @xcite .",
    "pwne formed from young pulsars with age less than a million years are considered as potential gamma - ray emitters @xcite . though a young age is not a sufficient condition for a pulsar to generate a pwn .",
    "the spin - down energy loss is the key parameter to determine whether a young energetic pulsar forms a pwn @xcite .",
    "the ratio between @xmath0-ray loud versus @xmath0-ray quiet pulsars is uncertain .",
    "@xcite suggests that all pulsars with @xmath18 are x - ray bright , manifest a distinct pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , and are associated with a supernova event . by studying the chandra data on the 28 most energetic pulsars of the parkes multibeam pulsar survey @xcite",
    "@xcite found that 15 pulsars with @xmath19 are x - ray bright , show a resolved pwn , and are associated with evidence of a supernova event .",

    "in fact for many of hess sources the location and luminosity are unknown .",
    "the number - intensity relation also gives information on the geometry of the volume in which the sources are contained if a uniform source distribution is assumed .",
    "deviation from a simple power law @xmath40 with slope -1 ( for the case of a thin disk ) means that the sources or their luminosity function are not spatially uniformly distributed .    the major difficulties in the study of the collective properties of the hess source population consist of the limited number of sources detected and the relatively small range of flux covered by the survey .",
    "also , the hess survey of the galaxy was not performed with uniform sensitivity .",
