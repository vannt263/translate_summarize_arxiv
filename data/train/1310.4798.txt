    ". however , the concrete detection of such spin liquids on realistic quantum spin models seems to be still a delicate issue @xcite .",
    "the source of this classification are the mean field wave functions based on the bosonic and fermionic representations for the spin operator , originally used in the context of large @xmath9 theories @xcite .",

    "another route for the search of unconventional phases due to magnetic frustration has been the study of finite temperature transitions involving the rupture of non - trivial discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "this kind of transitions have been extensively investigated in the context of the frustrated @xmath10 heisenberg model @xcite . here",
    "the magnetic phase breaks the discrete lattice rotation symmetry from @xmath11 to @xmath5 with an associated ising variable that gives a measure of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 magnetic correlations @xcite while rotational symmetry is unbroken , as dictated by mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "several analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies in the @xmath10 model have confirmed the occurrence of a finite temperature transition to a @xmath5 broken symmetry phase that belongs to the ising universality class .",
    "less explored , instead , has been the occurrence of such transition in the @xmath0 model where , in contrast to the original case , the spin correlations are of spiral type @xcite .",

    "classical monte carlo calculations @xcite predicts that a @xmath5 broken symmetry phase described by an ising nematic order parameter ( see below ) survives within the finite temperatures range ( see inset of figure [ tdiagram ] ) , being the transition also of the ising universality class . on the other hand , at zero temperature , numerical studies",

    "+ motivated by these results , in the present article , we investigate the occurrence of both , the zero temperature @xmath2 broken symmetry ground state and the finite temperature @xmath5 broken symmetry transition in the frustrated @xmath0 heisenberg model , using the schwinger boson mean filed theory .",
    "for the zero temperature quantum phase diagram ( figure [ fig1 ] ) we show that the two singlet scheme of the sbmf takes correctly into account the effect of frustration @xmath22 within the collinear phases leading to qualitative and quantitative differences with respect to previous calculations based on a one singlet scheme @xcite .",

    "there are two schemes of calculation : one takes advantage of the above identity and uses only @xmath50 operators @xcite while the other one keeps both , @xmath44 and @xmath43 operators @xcite . in principle",
    "both schemes are equivalent but at the mean field level the two singlet bond scheme has shown to be quite more accurate to describe the magnetically ordered regions of several frustrated models @xcite .",

    "the boundary of the @xmath5 broken symmetry regime has been numerically identified with the temperature @xmath24 where the nematic order parameter @xmath183 goes to zero . in the inset of figure [ tdiagram ]",
    "is shown the qualitative good agreement for the critical temperature @xmath24 of the @xmath5 broken symmetry phase , as a function of frustration , predicted by classical monte carlo and sbmf theory .",
    "given that the sbmf recovers the classical result in large @xmath126 limit , the slight shift to the right of @xmath24 with respect to classical mc results can be interpreted as the quantum effect for the @xmath19 case . actually , we expect an even marked shift once correction above the sbmf are computed .",
    "we have investigated the rupture of the discrete and continuous symmetries in the frustrated @xmath0 heisenberg model using schwinger boson mean field theory . we have studied in detail both , the @xmath2 broken symmetry which have been explicitly related to the condensate part of the ground state wave function and the @xmath5 broken symmetry related to the rupture of the discrete degeneracy of the @xmath117 and @xmath16 phases . by comparing with the already existent results , we have shown that the two singlet bond operator scheme of the sbmf give confiable results for the zero temperature quantum phase diagram .",
    "in particular , this scheme describes correctly the expected effects of frustration in the collinear phase @xcite that are not captured by the one singlet scheme used in the literature @xcite . for @xmath19 ,",
    "local spin fluctuations considerations allows us to infer a disordered regime @xmath4 that qualitatively agrees with recent numerical results @xcite .",
    "regarding the finite temperature regime , we have found a @xmath5 broken symmetry phase characterized by the nematic order parameter @xmath183 with the rotational invariance restored .",
    "the behavior of the critical temperature @xmath24 versus frustration agrees qualitatively well with classical monte carlo results @xcite . based on these classical mc results",
    ", it has been suggested the possible realization of a @xmath5 spin liquid with nematic order in the limit @xmath76 between the nel and spiral phases @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that in principle there is no connection between the @xmath5 global symmetry of the ising - like nematic order parameter @xmath183 and the @xmath5 gauge theory of the spin liquid phase . in the context of the low energy",
    "effective field theory the @xmath5 gauge symmetry corresponds to the @xmath5 gauge invariance of some spinor fields , analog to the schwinger boson spinors , that results from a particular parametrization of the spiral order @xcite . in the present microscopic sbmf",
    "the nature of the studied quantum and finite temperature solutions are of the same kind with a finite ising - like nematic order ; consequently it is important to remark that , if exists , the non trivial properties of the @xmath5 spin liquid state will appear , for instance , by solving the hard core local constraint exactly .",
    "nonetheless , at present , its implementation within the variational monte carlo shows severe limitations allowing to study system sizes up to @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "another interesting result is the general tendency of thermal fluctuations to stabilize collinear correlations .",
    "in particular , we have found transitions from spiral sro to collinear nel sro before reaching the paramagnetic phase : for @xmath25 short range nel @xmath7 correlations are favored while for @xmath26 there is an intermediate phase @xmath27 characterized by four decoupled third neighbours sublattices with sro nel correlations each one .",
    "classical monte carlo are called for the study of the @xmath27 phase .",
    "+ we have shown that the schwinger boson mean field theory is a simple and versatile tool that , once adequately implemented , is able to recover the main features of frustrated heisenberg models such as static , dynamic and finite temperature properties",
    ". it would be interesting to extend the study to doped frustrated antiferromagnets within the context of the @xmath218 model @xcite where it is known that spiral fluctuations change drastically the hole spectral functions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the two singlet bond operator scheme used in the present work can be properly extended to the study of anisotropic frustrated models .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath219 model on the triangular lattice we have found @xcite that the sbmf recovers the dispersion relation predicted by the spin wave plus @xmath220 corrections @xcite .",
