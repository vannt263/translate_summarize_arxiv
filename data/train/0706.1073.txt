    "the characterization of the internal dynamics of the intracluster medium is very important for determining the evolutionary stage of galaxy clusters ( beers et al . 1982 ) , to study cluster formation and to assess the systematics of using clusters of galaxies as cosmological tools .",
    "the presence of surface brightness features detected by the _",
    "satellite such as cold fronts , shock fronts and x - ray cavities shows that the intracluster gas ( icm ) is often dynamically active .",
    "furthermore , departure from assumptions such as hydrostatic equilibrium has been justified theoretically ( e.g. kay et al .",
    "2004 ; rasia , tormen & moscardini 2004 , 2006 ; pawl , evrard & dupke 2005 ) , but detection of bulk gas velocities became possible only with the launch of the _ asca _ satellite and more recently with the spectrometers on - board _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_.    the key ingredient to quantify the level of activity is the determination of gas bulk ( or turbulent ) velocities . in order to assess the gas dynamics we would ideally like to have a `` direct '' measurement of intracluster gas velocities .",
    "since the intracluster medium is enriched with heavy elements , this can be done , for example , by measuring the doppler shift of the spectral lines in x - ray frequencies ( dupke & bregman 2001a , b ) or by measuring changes in line broadening due to turbulence ( inogamov & sunyaev 2003 ; sunyaev , norman & bryan 2003 ; pawl et al .",
    "the former can currently be done only if there are enough photon counts within the spectral lines , if the instrumental gain is stable and well known and if the instrument has good spectral resolution .",
    "doppler shift analysis of clusters started with the _ asca _ satellite , which set constraints on bulk velocity gradients in 14 nearby clusters ( dupke & bregman 2001a , b , 2005 ) .",
    "however , _ asca _",
    "relatively high gain temporal variation limited velocity constraints to @xmath62000 km / s , so that it is crucial to corroborate and improve previous measurements of velocity gradients found in the _ asca _ sample with other instruments if we wish to investigate intracluster gas dynamics .    the higher stability and better spectral resolution of acis - s3 and mos 1 & 2 on - board _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites provide , currently , a unique opportunity to improve the constraints on icm velocity gradients , allowing a factor of @xmath7 2 improvement in the uncertainties of velocity measurements .",
    "the two clusters found to have the most significant velocity gradients with _",
    "asca _ were the centaurus cluster ( abell 3526 ) and abell 576 .",
    "velocity gradients have been confirmed in the centaurus cluster in two off - center _ chandra _ pointings ( dupke & bregman 2006 , hereafter db06 ; however , see ota et al . 2007 ) and here we show a combined velocity analysis of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ pointings of abell 576 .",
    "abell 576 is a richness class 1 cluster with relatively low ( t@xmath84 kev ) central gas temperatures and average metal abundances ( e.g. rothenflug et al .",

    "( 2000 ) determined the mass profile of a576 using the infall pattern in velocity space for more than 1000 galaxies in a radius of 4 h@xmath3 mpc from the cluster s center .",
    "they found that the mass of the central mpc was more than twice of that found from x - ray measurements , suggesting that nonthermal pressure support may be biasing the x - ray derived mass .",
    "additional evidence for strong departures from hydrostatic equilibrium comes from energy excess of the x - ray emitting gas with respect to the galaxies ( benatov et al .",
    "these characteristics can be partially explained by non - thermal pressure support and significant departures from spherical symmetry due to a line of sight merger .",
    "mohr et al . ( 1996 ) , using galaxy photometric data , found a high velocity tail separated by @xmath83000 km / s from the cluster s mean .",
    "kempner & david ( 2004 ) , hereafter kd04 , analyzed a chandra observation of the core of this cluster and found brightness edges corresponding to mild jumps in gas density and pressure roughly in the n - s direction .",
    "the x - ray image of the cluster also shows an `` arm '' extending to the sw and mild evidence of wakes ( `` fingers '' ) in the n - nw direction ( figure 1a ) .",
    "the authors suggested that the core substructures are caused by a current merger with core velocities of @xmath8 750 km  s@xmath3 , to maintain the gas confined across the surface brightness edge towards the n. in their scenario the merging cluster came in from the direction of the `` fingers '' ( n - nw ) , has passed the core of the main cluster , created the sw and w edges and is now near the second core passage . in this paper , we perform a velocity analysis of abell 576 using the full field of view covered by _",
    "_ s acis - s3 and combine it with two _ xmm _ s epic mos 1 & 2 from two observations , specifically tailored to minimize random gain variations across the ccds .",

    "all distances shown in this work are calculated assuming a h@xmath9 km  s@xmath3mpc@xmath3 and @xmath10 unless stated otherwise .",
    "abell 576 was observed for 39 ksec on oct 2002 centered on acis - s3 .",
    "nearly a fourth of the observation was affected by flares and we here show the analysis of the unaffected initial 29 ksec of observation .",
    "we used ciao 3.2.1 with caldb 3.1.0 to screen the data .",
    "the data were cleaned using standard procedure .",
    "grades 0,2,3,4,6 were used .",
    "acis particle background was cleaned as prescribed for vfaint mode .",
    "a gain map correction was applied together with pha and pixel randomization .",
    "point sources were extracted and the background used in spectral fits was generated from blank - sky observations using the acis_bkgrnd_lookup script .    in order to obtain a overall distribution of the spectral parameters we developed an `` adaptive smoothing '' code that selects regions for spectral extraction based on a pre - determined minimum number of counts , which for the cases shown here was 5000 cnt / cell .",
    "the overlap of extraction regions is therefore stronger in the low surface brightness regions , away from the cluster s core .",
    "we also excluded the ccd borders by @xmath8 1@xmath11 to avoid `` border effects '' , characteristic of these type of codes .",
    "the responses were created for each individual region with the ciao tools _ makeacisrmf _ and _ mkwarf_. spectra and background spectra were generated and fitted with xspec v11.3.1 ( arnaud 1996 ) with an absorbed vapec thermal emission models .",

    "energy ranges were restricted to 0.59.0 kev .",
    "the spectral fitting parameter errors listed here are 1-@xmath15 unless stated otherwise . for all spectral fittings used here we applied the recursive process to find the best - fit redshift with `` true '' @xmath16 minimum as described in db05 .",

    "newton _ on 2004 march 23 for @xmath8 22 ksec .",
    "a second observation was obtained a few days later on 2004 march 27 for a total of @xmath8 20 ksec .",
    "the observations were planned in such a way as to overlap the cluster s core , while providing sufficient coverage on the northeast and southwest of the cluster , which were the regions expected to have the strongest velocity gradient from a previous _ asca _ observation ( db05 ) ( figure 1b ) .",
    "this observational strategy was designed to minimize the impact that spatial variations of the gain ( conversion between pulse height and energy of an incoming photon ) has on redshift measurements .",
    "initial inspection of the epic mos and pn data revealed a number of strong background flares . in order to exclude these periods of high background",

    "in addition , only events satisfying grade patterns @xmath1712 have been used .",
    "the effective exposure times after removal of background flares correspond to @xmath8 12 ksec ( 55% of the total ) for the first pointing , and @xmath8 16 ksec ( 80% of the total ) for the second . using these cleaned event lists ,",
    "background spectra were produced from several source - free regions on the detector away from the source .",
    "blank - sky backgrounds were also used for comparison with no significant changes in the resulting best - fit parameters .",

    "xmm - newton _ science analysis system sas 6.0.0 .",
    "response files for each region have been generated using the sas tasks _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen_. bright point sources were extracted and the spectral fitting routine was identical to that used with the _ chandra _ data described in the previous section . only moss 1 & 2 were used because of the high number of interchip boundaries within our regions of interest in the pns , which would affect significantly the estimation of gain fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the loss of data due to flares was especially strong for the pns . despite the relatively small number of counts the _ xmm _ observation helped to constrain the spectral parameters derived from _",
    "the resulting temperature and velocity distributions from the adaptive smoothing routine applied to the _ chandra _ data are shown in figures 2a , b . the colors are chosen in a way as to show the average 1-@xmath15 variations . the temperature map shows that the cluster s core regions is relatively cold ( @xmath8 3.5 kev ) and has an overall asymmetric distribution .",
    "the coldest region ( @xmath83.0 kev ) is not found in the core but at the ne region .",
    "interestingly , it can also be seen that the highest gas temperature is found 2@xmath113@xmath11 towards the nw direction and reaches @xmath185 kev .",
    "this was not noted in kd04 , due to their choice of orientation for selection of the extraction regions .",
    "overall , the temperature distribution follows roughly a configuration where a cold core is surrounded by a hotter elliptical ring elongated along the nw - se direction ( shown by the dashed lines in figure 2a ) .",
    "there are also marginal indications that the temperature decreases again at regions @xmath03@xmath11 to the e and s directions .",
    "the velocity map ( figure 2b ) is not smooth and shows higher velocities in the southern regions , and a clear zone of lower redshifts to the ne that extends to the central region .",
    "even though the highest redshift zone is apparently in the se corner , analysis of the error map in figure 2c shows that region has very high uncertainties . to find the regions of maximum significance of velocity measurements , in each cell we divided the difference of the best fit redshift from the average over the ccd ( denoted by @xmath19 ) by the error of the measured redshift @xmath20z .",
    "i.e. , @xmath21 ( see db05 & db06 for details ) .",
    "we denote this error - weighted - deviation simply as deviation significance and plot its color contours in figure 2c . in figure",
    "2c the black and white represent negative and positive velocities , respectively , with respect to the ccd average velocity .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation significance shows how significant the velocity structure is .",
    "we can see that the region of maximum negative significance is located slightly to the e of the cluster center .",
    "there is also a region of marginally higher positive significance ( @xmath83@xmath15 ) to the sw , in good agreement with previous observations with _",
    "asca_. based on these two deviation significance peaks we selected two regions for a more detailed study , shown in figure 1b as black rectangles ; a high ( redshifted ) and low ( blueshifted ) redshift regions , hereafter called south and east , respectively .",
    "although the cluster core seems to be included in the blueshifted zone in both _",
    ", _ xmm _ ( and was also in _ asca _ siss ) we , conservatively , avoid including it in our velocity analysis due to modeling uncertainties ( see db05 for a more extended discussion on the effects of multiple models in the best - fit redshift with the technique used here ) .",
    "below we explore in more detail the spectral analysis of these regions .",
    "the best - fit gas temperatures , iron abundances and velocities for the two regions with highest deviations from the average redshift are plotted in figure 3a and listed in table 1 .",
    "the spectra corresponding two these two regions are shown in figures 3b , c , d for different spectrometers .",
    "individual spectral fits of these regions show very similar gas temperatures , with an error weighted average of 3.87@xmath22 kev for south and 4.00@xmath22 kev for east , and also similar iron abundances , with an error weighted average of 0.54@xmath23 solar for south and 0.52@xmath24 solar for east ) .",
    "however , they show very discrepant radial velocities . with _",
    "chandra _ , south shows a best - fit redshift of ( 3.71@xmath25),@xmath1 10@xmath26 consistent with the overall redshift determined optically ( 0.039@xmath270.0003 , mohr et al .",
    "the east region shows a much lower best - fit redshift of @xmath50.016 ( the lower limits are not well constrained and are consistent with 0 ) , implying a velocity difference of @xmath0 3900 km  s@xmath3 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the velocity difference is consistent and better constrained than those obtained for similar regions with the _ asca _ spectrometers .",
    "_ xmm _ moss analysis of the same regions show similar velocity gradient . with mos 2",
    "the upper limit of the redshift values is not well constrained ( there is a secondary @xmath28 minimum for the best - fit redshift at @xmath29 ) .",
    "since the overall results are very consistent between the two moss , we fitted mos 1 & 2 spectra simultaneously to improve statistics .",
    "the results of the simultaneous fittings are also displayed in table 1 .",
    "the best fit redshift difference between these two regions is found to be @xmath0 4000 km  s@xmath3 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "we can assess the statistical uncertainties of the velocity differences between these two region using the f - test , i.e. , fitting the spectra of the two regions simultaneously with the redshifts locked together and comparing the resulting @xmath28 to that of simultaneous fittings where the redshifts are allowed to vary independently .",
    "the f - test indicates that the velocity differences in these two regions is significant at the 99.8% , 97.6% confidence level for _ chandra _ acis - s3 , and mos 1 & 2 , respectively .",
    "the error - weighted average velocity difference from all three detectors is ( 5.9@xmath271.6)@xmath110@xmath2 km  s@xmath3 ( the errors are 1-@xmath15 ) .",
    "the significance of the velocity gradient described above only includes statistical uncertainties .",
    "the major source of uncertainty in velocity measurements with current spectrometers is the temporal and spatial variations of the instrumental gain .",
    "as in db06 , we can estimate the effects of residual gain fluctuations through monte carlo simulations . given the relatively early date of the observations",
    ", we used the study of the gain variations in the first 20 rows of _ chandra _ acis - s3 by grant ( 2001 ) and assume that they also represent the expected variation for the moss as well . for a discussion on the gain stability in the _ xmm",
    "_ detectors see andersson & madejski ( 2004 ) .    in order to assess the impact that random gain fluctuations would have on our results we simulated 500 spectra for _ chandra _ , mos 1 and mos 2 using the xspec tool fakeit .",
    "the simulated spectra had the same input values as those obtained through spectral fittings of the real data in regions south and east for n@xmath30 , temperature , oxygen , neon , magnesium , silicon , sulfur , argon , calcium , iron , nickel , normalization and were set at some intermediary redshift ( z=0.029 ) .",
    "the background and responses corresponded to that of the real data .",
    "poisson errors were included .",
    "the simulated spectra was then used to estimate the probability that a velocity difference similar or greater than that observed in the real data in acis - s3 , mos 1 and mos 2 could be generated by chance and how this probability depended on the magnitude of gain fluctuations .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4a , where we plot the probability that c(z@xmath31  z@xmath32 ) @xmath0 @xmath33v as a function of the 1-@xmath15 variation of the gain assumed 300 km  s@xmath3 for individual velocity measurements , ( grant 2001 ) .",
    "we can see from figure 4a that the significance of the velocity gradient is @xmath099% assuming a 3-@xmath15 gain variation .",
    "the two _ xmm _ pointings from which the extraction regions were analyzed were taken with a separation of four days .",
    "we checked for possible anomalous gain variations that might have occurred between the two off - center observations by using a large elliptical region surrounding the cluster s center discussed in section 6.2 ( seen in figure 2a as the outer dashed lines ) .",
    "we fitted an absorbed apec model and checked for redshift differences between different epochs in mos 1 & 2 data individually .",
    "the best fit redshifts in the two epochs for mos 1 are ( 3.98@xmath270.39 ) @xmath1 10@xmath26 and ( 3.61@xmath270.26 ) @xmath1 10@xmath26 .",
    "for mos 2 the corresponding values are ( 3.56@xmath270.39 ) @xmath1 10@xmath26 and ( 3.66@xmath270.13 ) @xmath1 10@xmath26 .",
    "there were no significant changes in best - fit global redshift between the two observations and also between different detectors .",
    "given the random variation of instrumental gain with position and time in the ccds , it is useful to check whether some particular ccd region has been more affected than others . similarly to db06 , we split the cleaned final acis - s3 event file into 3 different epochs ( with @xmath89.7 ksec each ) and performed the same velocity mapping as that described previously , i.e. , through an adaptive smoothing routine that keeps a fixed minimum number of counts per region ( 5000 counts ) maintaining the range of fitting errors more or less constant for different regions .",
    "we then determined the standard deviation of the best fit velocities for the same region over different time periods .",
    "we plot the results in figure 4b , where regions of high scatter are brighter .",
    "the color steps in figure 4b represent the average 1@xmath15 fitting errors of the individual regions used to construct the velocity map . from figure 2d",
    ", we can see that the regions of significant low and high velocities are located in the zones with minimum redshift scatter ( @xmath340.004 ) .",
    "this suggests that the velocity gradient is not dominated by local temporal variations of the gain .",
    "that was the only instrument with enough counts to perform this analysis , given the loss of photons to flares with the _ xmm _ data .",
    "elemental abundance ratios can be used to determine the enrichment history of the intracluster gas ( e.g. mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) and can , potentially , be used to characterize the icm and to trace the origin of the undisturbed gas during merging ( e.g. dupke & white 2003 ) .",
    "this is because the internal variation of these ratios is not random , but show typically a central dominance of sn ia ejecta ( dupke & white 2000a , b ; finoguenov et al .",
    "2000 ; allen et al .",
    "dupke & white ( 2003 ) have used the `` lack '' of a chemical discontinuity in some cold fronts to point out that the scenario that cold fronts are caused by the unmixed remnant core of an accreted subsystem ( markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ) is not the unique way to make cold fronts .",
    "here we use abundance ratios to test the merging scenario , i.e. , looking for a discontinuity that separates two different media with different enrichment histories .    given the low temperatures and poor photon statistics for both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ observations the abundances of silicon and iron are the best defined and isolated lines in the x - ray spectra in our usable frequency range .",
    "the si / fe ratio spans a relatively wide range of values between sn ia and ii yields , even when taking into account the theoretical yield uncertainties of different sn models ( gibson et al .",
    "1997 ; dupke & white 2001a , b ) . using the same adaptive smoothing routine",
    "as described above we mapped the si / fe ratio throughout the cluster region with acis - s3 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5a .",
    "the cluster s core sits on a clear separation between two media , highly discrepant in sn type dominance .",
    "the fe mass fraction towards the w and nw is strongly dominated by sn ia ejecta while the e side is sn ii ejecta dominated . the transition from sn ia to ii dominance",
    "is nearly centered along the arrow shaped brightness edge .",
    "based on the si / fe _ chandra _ map we selected three characteristic regions for a direct comparison of the chemical enrichment gradient measured with _",
    "chandra _ & _ xmm_. these regions are circular and are denoted by cw ( circle west ) , c0 ( circle center ) , ce ( circle east ) in figure 1b . individual silicon and iron abundances",
    "are shown in table 2 and their ratios derived from different instruments are plotted in figure 5b . in figure 5b",
    "we also show the theoretical limits for 100% sn ii fe mass fraction ( top horizontal line ) and 100% sn ia fe mass fraction for four theoretical supernova explosion models that differ in their explosion characteristics ( nomoto et al .",
    "1997a , b ) .",
    "the error weighted average of the sn ia fe mass fraction contribution for cw is found to be 100@xmath35% as opposed to 33@xmath2722% found for the ce region .",
    "in this work we re - analyzed the _",
    "chandra _ observation of abell 576 and determined the spatial distribution of temperatures , individual elemental abundances and radial velocities of the icm , using the full field of view of the acis - s3 and also two new _ xmm _ observations covering similar spatial scales .",
    "this allowed us to compare the results obtained with different instruments having different systematic uncertainties .",
    "the velocity distribution near the core of the cluster shows a strong velocity gradient , in very good agreement both in magnitude and direction with the velocity gradient found with both siss onboard _ asca_. the error weighted average ( over acis - s3 , mos 1 & mos 2 ) maximum velocity difference is found to be ( 5.9@xmath271.6)@xmath110@xmath2 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the combined set of observations makes the significance of velocity detection @xmath099.9% confidence , when standard ( 1@xmath15 ) gain fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "we also found a strong chemical gradient in the intracluster gas of this cluster .",
    "the distribution of iron and silicon abundances is asymmetric in such a way as to produce a clear separation of the si / fe ratio at the cluster s center .",
    "if converted to sn type enrichment , the results indicate that nearly 67% of the fe mass has been produced by sn ii towards the e and that the fe mass content in the icm towards the w and nw direction has been fully produced by sn ia ( @xmath4 9% produced by sn ii ) .",
    "this chemical gradient is very asymmetric , not consistent with the radial chemical gradients found in some other clusters ( e.g. dupke 1998 ; dupke & white 2000a , b 2003 ; finoguenov et al .",

    "2004 baumgartner et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the general characteristics of this cluster are consistent with a merging origin as proposed by kd04 .",
    "however , the velocity gradient in a576 suggests a larger line - of - sight component for the merger axis .",
    "the distribution of galaxy velocities in the field of a576 do not show any clear spatial segregation ( rines et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , the distribution of galaxies ( from the ned database ) with redshift within r@xmath36 shows at least two large concentrations between 0.03@xmath4z@xmath40.07 ( figure 6a ) .",
    "the first one is centered at z@xmath8 0.0387 , which is the characteristic cluster redshift . since the velocity gradient found with _",
    "chandra _ & _ xmm _ is very high we consider also the second galaxy clump at z@xmath80.065 .",
    "we separate three galaxy groups based on redshift : a low z group ( 0.03@xmath4z@xmath40.0387 ) , a high z group ( 0.0387@xmath4z@xmath40.05 ) and a very high z group ( 0.057@xmath4z@xmath40.07 ) .",
    "we plot the galaxies for these three groups in figures 6b , c .",
    "it can be seen from figure 6b that the distribution of the 97 low z galaxies ( blue ) seem more isotropic than that of the 76 high z galaxies ( red ) , which seems to be more concentrated towards the sw of the cluster .",
    "the distribution of the 24 very high z galaxies ( magenta ) is displaced even more to the sw .",
    "figure 6c shows a blow - up of figure 6b with the velocity centroids of the three redshift groups ( shown by `` x ' 's with the corresponding group colors ) .",
    "the velocity centroids are 2@xmath11.4 ( 2@xmath11.2 ) away form the x - ray center for the low ( high ) z group .",
    "the x - ray center is also @xmath71@xmath11.3 from the line connecting the centroids of the two groups , this difference is significantly out of the error ellipsoid for the velocity centroid ( assuming 6@xmath110@xmath37 and 2@xmath38.5 errors for redshift & position , respectively ( ned ) ) .",
    "it is very difficult to make a direct comparison between the velocity measurements obtained from galaxy velocities and x - ray measurements given the difference of spatial scales . in general ,",
    "the optical results are not inconsistent with the x - ray measurements .",
    "however , the absolute values between the redshifts of the galaxy concentrations and those obtained from x - ray spectroscopy are discrepant and the results can only be compatible if there is an overall gain correction upwards .",
    "we do not have an external source to calibrate global gain corrections but it is unlikely that the same correction would affect all three different instruments in different epochs . on the other hand , the methodology used here is sensitive to gain dependence on frequency ( e.g. , dupke & bregman 2001b ) and this is likely the reason for this discrepancy given the low temperatures of teh cluster ( the redshift fitting process is weighted by the fel complex ) .",
    "even though the _ absolute _ redshift values may be inaccurate , the redshift _ differences _ should not be affected , since the same methodology was applied to all regions / and observations .",
    "so , we will assume that a correction of @xmath20z@xmath80.0150.02 should be applied to all measured redshifts when comparing the data in x - ray and optical frequencies .",
    "the orientation of the low  high velocity regions is very similar to that found in x - ray velocity measurements ( ne  sw ) .",
    "we also show the centroid of the joint high & very high z group in yellow .",
    "the centroid of this group coincides with the most significant high velocity region ( figure 2d ) . the above mentioned results using galaxy velocities",
    "can also be interpreted as due to an unusual amount of interlopers ( e.g. wojtak & loas 2007 ) and in this section we discuss two scenarios that can explain the observations , i.e. , projection of a background cluster and post - core crossing line of sight merging",
    ".      the results presented above can be at least partially interpreted as resulting from a scenario where a576 is , in reality , two clusters closely aligned in the line of sight .",
    "the two clusters could be gravitationally unbound or in a pre - merger stage , in which case the velocity gradient would be mostly attributed to the clusters hubble distances . in this scenario",
    "the cores of both clusters would have to be near aligned in order to escape easy identification of a secondary peak in surface brightness .",
    "optical studies of a576 show several peculiarities that can be interpreted either as consequences of a cluster - cluster merging or as due to projection effects .",
    "rines et al .",

    "their method does not need the equilibrium assumptions typically used in x - ray mass estimations and relies on the fact that the velocity field around clusters is determined by the local dynamics of the dark matter halo .",
    "the amplitude of the characteristic `` trumpet shaped '' caustics in their velocity @xmath1 radius plot is related to the escape velocity around halos . from their analysis one can infer that this cluster is passing through a major disturbance for several reasons , among them , ( 1 ) a `` finger '' in phase space with high velocities for radii @xmath4 2.9 @xmath39 mpc ( figure 4 of r00 ; see also rines et al .",

    "1996 ) .    in order to estimate the likelihood that the velocity gradient is due to projection effects we looked at the distribution of galaxy clusters from cosmological n - body hubble volume simulations . for that we use the positions of clusters in a 3 gpc cube at z@xmath180 selected in the data generated in evrard et al .",
    "the virtual clusters were generated in a flat @xmath40cdm model , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 of 0.3 and 0.7 , respectively and @xmath43=0.9 .",
    "clusters were found using an algorithm that identifies halos as spheres , centered on local density maxima , with radii defined by a mean interior isodensity condition ( see appendix a of evrard et al .",
    "2002 for details ) .",
    "we searched within 500000 mock clusters those that had a projected core separation within 180 h@xmath44 kpc , corresponding to 3.5@xmath11 at a redshift @xmath80.04 . to be conservative we searched for a radial distance separation within 2@xmath15 above and below the average redshift difference value of ( 5.9@xmath271.6)@xmath110@xmath2  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the results showed 265 systems that satisfied this criteria indicating a probability of 5@xmath110@xmath45 to find such systems in the nearby universe .",
    "local mergers are , however , much more frequent .",
    "the same above mentioned monte carlo strategy applied to angular scales equivalent to the virial radius of a 4 kev cluster , i.e. , r@xmath46 mpc  =  1.7 @xmath39 mpc , finds 3.9@xmath110@xmath47 in 5@xmath110@xmath48 clusters , i.e. , a probability of 0.078 .",
    "this estimate includes pairs of all relative velocities , but a recent analysis of subhalo  host halo velocity differences found for `` bullet clusters '' type ( 1e 0657 - 56  markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ) halos in the millennium simulation ( hayashi & white 2006 ) indicates that large velocity differences are not uncommon .",
    "they find that 40% of all host halos would have 1 out of the 10 most massive sub - halos with a velocity as high as that of the `` bullet cluster '' . from these studies",
    ", we roughly estimate that the likelihood of an ongoing merger with sufficiently high relative velocity is at the percent level , and thus a few examples in the local population of observed massive clusters should be expected .    the distribution of gas temperature , iron abundance , abundance ratios suggest that the merging axis component on the plane of the sky would follow a nw - se direction .",
    "the best configuration that explains the magnitude of the velocity gradient is a scenario similar to that of the `` bullet '' cluster ( 1e0657 - 56 ) , i.e. , a violent merger of two colder clusters and a ( initial ) merger axis making @xmath8 80@xmath49 with the plane of the sky and a small ( @xmath8 10@xmath49 , see below ) deviation with respect to the n ",

    "we compared two spectral models fitting simultaneously five data sets , _",
    "mos 1 & 2 data from the two pointings and acis - s3 data .",
    "the first one ( model 1 ) was a single temperature wabs apec .",
    "the second ( model 2 ) was a a double temperature wabs ( apec + apec ) corresponding to the cold and hot components .",
    "the cold component temperature was fixed at 3.5 kev , the lowest temperature observed throughout the temperature map .",
    "the normalization of the hot component was fixed at a fraction , f@xmath50 of that of the cold component .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in the two models is the same given the constrains imposed to the double temperature component .",
    "we varied f@xmath50 from 1% to 99% and recorded the best - fit parameters .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7a , where we plot the @xmath28 distribution as a function of f@xmath50 .",
    "it can be seen that the lowest @xmath28 is achieved at @xmath825% with a corresponding high temperature of 11.8 kev @xmath4 t @xmath4 21 kev at the 1@xmath15 level . from figure",
    "7a we can see that model 2 spectral fittings with f@xmath51  12% is better than those using a single temperature component ( model 1 ) , which has a @xmath28 of 1407 and is shown in figure 7a as a straight line with a best fit temperature of 4.1 kev .    for comparison",
    ", we estimated the fractional contribution of the hot component using a recently archived 100 ksec chandra exposure of 1e0657 - 56 ( observation i d 5356 ) . in figure",
    "7b we show the raw x - ray image and the rectangular region used to extract a surface brightness profile along the main direction of motion of the `` bullet '' to estimate the relative emission measure .",
    "the size of the rectangular region ( @xmath825@xmath38 ) corresponds to @xmath83@xmath11 region in a576 .",
    "on figure 7c we show the surface brightness profile along the slice . from right",
    "to left the first surface brightness enhancement before the `` spike '' associated with the cool `` bullet '' is that of the shock region .",
    "then , we see the colder `` bullet '' followed by extended peak of the disturbed core of the primary cluster . the last component is a hot tail .",
    "we separated the regions in three parts based on the temperature map in markevitch et al .",
    "the distribution of photon counts for these three components ( again from right to left ) is approximately 1000 counts ( shock region ) , 14500 counts ( the two cold cores ) and 3000 counts ( hot tail ) , which would place the f@xmath50 ( hot / cold ) at @xmath8 26% assuming that the bow shock symmetrically covers the two cluster cores .",
    "this fraction can be directly compared to that derived using spectral fittings up to the precision of a ( weak ) function of temperature f(t ) ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to carry out detailed modeling of 1e0657 - 56 .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that the overall agreement of f@xmath50 with what would be expected from `` seeing '' the `` bullet '' cluster along the merging axis is very consistent with a a576 passing through a near line of sight collision .    with the available data we do not have enough photon statistics and energy coverage to disentangle the multiple temperature components in the line of sight , i.e. , cold gas from the pre - shocked icm , a relatively thin bow shock , the projected high density cold cores , and finally the post and pre shocked material at the largest depth .",
    "however , we can roughly estimate a few merger parameters with the data at hand . from simple geometrical principles for a line of",
    "sight merger started at a time `` -t@xmath53 '' , the perturbation perpendicular to the surface of the mach cone will propagate with the sound speed , so that the @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is half angle of the cone , c@xmath56 is the sound speed given by @xmath57  km  s@xmath3 , and b the projected distance from the merging axis to the point where the sonic perturbation is at a time @xmath58 . since the mach number @xmath59 , the time when the shock front was effectively initiated is then @xmath60 or @xmath61 gy ago , assuming b to be @xmath62 , where 2b@xmath83@xmath63.5 would be the projected distance between the two `` hot '' regions ( nw & e of the central region ) in figure 2a .",
    "the distance traveled by the core along the line of sight during this time is @xmath64 mpc for m=6@xmath271.6 , using the error - weighted average velocity derived from _",
    "chandra _ & _ xmm _ data .",
    "the point in the past that the two merging clusters overcome the hubble flow , with zero relative radial velocity ( half the orbital period ) , can be given by @xmath65 mpc , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the total mass normalized by @xmath68 and @xmath67 is the core crossing time normalized by a hubble time ( set to 1.37@xmath69yr ) . from conservation of energy and angular momentum the relative velocity of the sub - systems at a distance `` r '' from each other",
    "is given by ( e.g. ricker and sarazin 2001 )      where b is the impact parameter .",
    "if we use the distance between the x - ray peak and the midpoint between the two `` hot '' regions ( @xmath71 ) in figure 2a as the impact parameter we obtain b=50@xmath2725  @xmath39  kpc . taking the total mass derived by rines et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , i.e. , @xmath72 , the relative velocity at @xmath73 , when the merger shock is effectively initiated , is found to be ( 3.8 @xmath27 0.63)@xmath110@xmath2  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this is in the lower end , but consistent , within the errors , with the observed velocity gradient , described in the previous paragraphs .    as pointed by dupke & bregman ( 2002 ) and sunyaev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) icm velocity detections can be corroborated by the use of the kinetic s - z effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , 1972 , 1980 ) .",
    "intracluster gas bulk velocities as high as those detected in a576 should generate significantly different levels of comptonization of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) towards different direction of the cluster ( red - shifted and blue - shifted sides ) .",
    "the total cmbr temperature variation towards the direction of a moving cluster has a thermal and a kinetic component :      where @xmath75 & @xmath76 are respectively the icm and cmbr temperatures , v@xmath77 is the radial velocity , @xmath78 and the other parameters have their usual meanings ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , 1972 , 1980 ) . if the gas number density @xmath79 follows a king - like profile @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are respectively the core radius and the central density , the thompson optical depth is given as a function of the projected radius `` @xmath83 '' by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the beta function of p , q. using @xmath86=0.64 , @xmath87=240 @xmath88 kpc , and @xmath82=2@xmath110@xmath89 cm@xmath89 ( mohr et al 1996 ) , @xmath91 and from equation ( 1 ) we get ( @xmath92  =  2.6@xmath110@xmath37 , near the optimal frequency to observe the kinetic effect .",
    "this effect could be detected with current ( or in development ) instruments , such as the _ bolocam _ , _ acbar _ ( runyan et al .",
    "2003 ) , suzie ( holzapfel et al . 1997 ) or _",
    "planck_.    the low photon statistics limits our ability to fully disentangle the 3-d physics of the merging event to make a close comparison to theoretical / numerical models .",
    "however , this work suggests that the temperature , abundance and velocity distributions in abell 576 are consistent with a scenario where the cluster is passing through a line of sight merger similar to that in the `` bullet '' cluster .",
    "if corroborated , this could provide a unique template to study supersonic line of sight cluster merger collisions .",
