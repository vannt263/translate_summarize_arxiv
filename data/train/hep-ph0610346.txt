    "the notion of quartification is predicated upon the hypothesis of quark - lepton universality at high energies .",
    "quark - lepton universality is typically implemented by the imposition of a discrete interchange symmetry between quarks and leptons , a demand which further requires the introduction of a leptonic colour gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "this leads one to the so called quark - lepton symmetric model  @xcite wherein the known leptons are identified as one member of a generalised @xmath6 lepton triplet .",
    "one of the primary goals of modern theoretical particle physics is to identify extensions to the standard model ( sm ) , with some of the most appealing extensions being grand unified theories ( guts ) . adding a leptonic colour group to the sm",
    "clearly renders the traditional approaches to unification , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 , inapplicable .",
    "it was the desire to uncover a unified theory capable of accommodating the notion of quark - lepton universality which motivated the construction of the quartification model  @xcite .",
    "borrowing from the notion of trinification  @xcite , which postulates the gauge group @xmath9 augmented by a cyclic @xmath10 symmetry , the quartification model posits the gauge group @xmath11 with a cyclic @xmath12 symmetry permuting the group factors .",
    "the discrete groups ensure a single coupling constant at the unification scale and thus , a crucial feature of guts , namely the unification of the gauge coupling parameters , can ensue .",
    "whilst in its original implementation only partial unification was achieved  @xcite , it was subsequently demonstrated that the modification of the exotic lepton mass spectrum permitted full unification  @xcite .",
    "this motivated a recent study of quartification models with intermediate symmetry breaking scales  @xcite where it was shown that unification could be achieved via a number of different symmetry breaking routes .    in",
    "@xcite a subset of schemes which allowed for unification and maintained phenomenological consistency were uncovered .",
    "although representing an improvement on the original quartified theories of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , these models exhibited some of the unsatisfactory features common to conventional guts , resulting mostly from the higgs sector .",
    "a large number of scalar multiplets were required to achieve a realistic model and any potential describing their self - interactions would contain a plethora of unknown parameters . furthermore , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and mass spectra of the fields was not predicated by the theory , forcing a variety of assumptions on this sector .",
    "orbifold compactifications , however , uncover a new arena by which to explore guts .",
    "the compactification process provides a geometrical origin for the symmetry breaking , allowing for the removal of the scalar sectors which complicate conventional 4d unified theories .",
    "the ability to obtain a consistent effective field theory on these constructions has motivated the use of orbifolds to probe grand unified theories  @xcite .",
    "even the sm higgs field has a natural origin in orbifold models , with gauge - higgs unified theories identifying the higgs doublet as higher dimensional components of the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "this type of hybrid model was recently explored in a supersymmetric trinification theory by carone and conroy  @xcite .",
    "they placed the trinification gauge supermultiplets on a five dimensional orbifold , and localised the full trinified matter content onto a brane .",
    "the orbifold action reduced the symmetry down to a subgroup on this subspace .",
    "this symmetry was then broken to the sm gauge group by a boundary scalar sector which decoupled from the low - energy theory .",
    "additionally , the sm higgs doublets were recovered as remnant zero modes of the gauge fields .",
    "the realisation of a gut that is not reliant upon a scalar sector and its associated problems provides the motivation to explore quartification in this orbifold context .",
    "we follow a similar approach to carone and conroy  @xcite , considering a five dimensional quartification model and studying the prospects for unification within this framework .",
    "interestingly we find that unification is only achieved when the remnant leptonic colour group @xmath13 remains unbroken .",
    "furthermore the demands of a phenomenologically acceptable fermion spectrum specifies the choice of orbifold symmetry reduction on the sm matter brane and thus we arrive at a unique five dimensional quartification model which achieves unification .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : quart_prelim ] provides the reader with a brief summary of the quartification framework . in section  [ sec : quart_symmetry_b ] we consider the higher dimensional symmetry breaking necessary to reduce @xmath14 to an acceptable low energy subgroup .",
    "the symmetry breaking occurs in two distinct ways , via both orbifolding and the introduction of a boundary higgs sector ( which we ultimately decouple from the theory ) , and we detail each of these mechanisms . in section",
    "[ sec : quart_fermion_mass ] we consider fermion mass in the model and demonstrate that the exotic fermions all obtain gut scale masses whilst the sm fermions remain massless until electroweak symmetry breaking occurs . section  [ sec : quart_unification ] covers the issue of gauge coupling unification within the model and we contrast our five dimensional model with conventional approaches in section  [ sec : quart_comparison ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : quart_conc ] .",
    "in this section we briefly surmise the conventional quartification framework . for more details refer to  @xcite .",
    "the quartification gauge group is @xmath15 a @xmath12 symmetry which cyclicly permutes the gauge groups as per @xmath16 is also imposed to ensure a single gauge coupling constant .",
    "the fermion assignment is anomaly - free , with each family contained within a left - handed @xmath17 of eq .",

    "where the leptonic colour symmetry is entirely broken @xmath3 , the @xmath36 and @xmath37 leptons become neutral .",
    "the higgs sector required to reproduce acceptable low energy phenomenology in 4d quartification models @xcite consists of two different @xmath38 s of @xmath39 which are labelled as per @xmath40 these fields are closed under the @xmath12 symmetry and generate realistic fermion masses and mixings .",
    "we shall not require the two @xmath38 s of scalars to accomplish the necessary symmetry breaking in the 5d model , relying instead on the orbifold geometry .",
    "the subsequent absence of scalars with non - trivial @xmath41 quantum numbers removes issues of proton stability in this higher dimensional context .",
    "we consider a pure quartification gauge theory defined in a five dimensional spacetime , with the extra dimensional coordinate labelled @xmath42 .",
    "this extra dimension is compactified on an @xmath43 orbifold .",
    "this procedure constrains the spacetime geometry as per @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "these identifications have the effect of reducing the physical region to the interval @xmath46 $ ] with two fixed points located at @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these points are geometrical singularities and are thus chosen as the location of 4d branes .",
    "for simplicity , we shall consider all matter fields to be localised on the @xmath48 brane , which we shall refer to as the matter brane , while the brane at @xmath47 remains `` hidden '' .",
    "the orbifold action also has a definition on the space of gauge fields which freely propagate in the bulk .",
    "the quartification gauge fields are denoted by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gauge index and @xmath51 is the lorentz index @xmath52 .",
    "we define @xmath53 and @xmath54 to be @xmath23 matrix representations of the orbifold actions @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively . to maintain gauge invariance under these projections , the gauge fields are required to have the transformations @xmath57 given that @xmath53 and @xmath54 define a representation of reflection symmetries , their eigenvalues are @xmath58 , and thus we can express these matrices in diagonal form , with a freedom in the parity choice of the entries .",
    "the exact nature of these actions then completely determines the gauge symmetry which remains unbroken at the fixed points .",
    "unless @xmath53 is the identity matrix , not all the gauge fields will commute with the orbifold action .",
    "these fields are projected off the brane , and thus only a subset of the 5d gauge theory is manifest at the fixed points . ideally , one would desire the matter brane to respect only the sm gauge group ; however , this is not directly possible here via orbifolding .",
    "the @xmath59 actions are abelian and commute with the diagonal quartification generators .",
    "subsequently , the rank of the quartification group must be preserved on the matter brane .",
    "this means that breaking unwanted @xmath60 factors has the trade - off of retaining the spurious @xmath61 subgroups .",
    "thus one must invoke a mechanism in tandem to orbifolding in order to accomplish the breaking to @xmath4 .",
    "we shall choose to have higgs fields @xmath62 localised on @xmath48 to instigate the rank - reducing breaking , giving the general symmetry breaking framework @xmath63 this type of hybrid model has been explored recently in the context of @xmath8 @xcite and the aforementioned @xmath64  @xcite orbifold guts .",
    "we shall consider the case where there is a residual @xmath5 symmetry in what follows .",
    "it is phenomenologically acceptable to retain @xmath5 as an exact low energy symmetry .",
    "this symmetry acts only on exotic leptons which fill out the @xmath6 multiplets ( known as liptons in the literature ) .",
    "these are constrained to be heavier than a tev and will be much heavier than this in our construct .",
    "we shall comment on the case when @xmath5 is broken ( namely @xmath3 ) in section  [ sec : quart_broken_su2 ] .    the group @xmath65 is determined by the desire to reproduce the correct sm matter content on the brane at the @xmath48 fixed point .",
    "it turns out that the only feasible choice is to consider the orbifold returning the symmetry @xmath66 .",
    "all other options do not return a favourable low energy theory .",
    "for example , we require the @xmath67 symmetry to generate realistic quark masses , and the @xmath68 symmetry must be realised so as to return a sm higgs .",
    "the full leptonic colour symmetry @xmath6 also needs to be respected on the matter brane .",
    "if this symmetry was broken , then indistinguishability issues surface between the sm leptons and their liptonic partners .",
    "the orbifold action can be decomposed as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 under this action , the parity assignments of the vector components of the gauge multiplets are @xmath71 the wavefunctions of these component fields have the kaluza - klein decompositions @xmath72 the towers of @xmath73 fields @xmath74 upon compactification acquire kk masses @xmath75 respectively where @xmath76 is defined to be the compactification scale .",
    "only the @xmath77 fields possess massless zero modes , and hence the massless sector is restricted to a subset of the full 5d theory .",
    "the towers @xmath78 and @xmath79 have degenerate mass spectra , as do the towers @xmath80 and @xmath77 excluding the zero mode .",
    "we can now discern the nature of the theory on the branes .",
    "in general , only those fields which are odd under @xmath81 vanish at @xmath82 .",
    "thus , one can see that at @xmath47 , the gauge symmetry @xmath83 is respected , while at the fixed point @xmath48 the symmetry is @xmath84 .",
    "the cumulative effect of the orbifold compactification is the reduction of the overall symmetry to the intersection of these two subgroups , @xmath85 .",
    "clearly further symmetry breaking is required to firstly reproduce , then break , the sm .    as evident in eq .",
    "[ eq : projections ] , the scalar components @xmath86 necessarily have opposite parities to their vector counterparts allowing one to determine the scalar content at the fixed points .",
    "the transformation of @xmath87 importantly reveals a scalar doublet which has a massless zero mode at the 4d level , and this possesses the appropriate hypercharge to be identified as a sm higgs doublet .",
    "this type of identification is referred to as gauge - higgs unification and has been employed extensively as an origin for the ew higgs in orbifold guts  @xcite . attention to this sector will be given in section  [ cha : ewhiggs ] .",
    "after the orbifold compactification , the symmetry of the 4d effective theory is @xmath88 , while on the matter brane the gauge symmetry is @xmath89 the usual approach to breaking this remaining symmetry is to implement boundary conditions on the compactified space for the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "this method is more generalised than the orbifold mechanism , leading to a greater set of symmetry breaking opportunities .",
    "the structure of the boundary conditions are realised in a uv completion of our gut theory in which localised scalar fields @xmath62 prescribe the breaking .",
    "as the fields are localised on the matter brane where only the reduced @xmath90 symmetry is operative , the fields are housed in incomplete quartification multiplets , with transformation properties @xmath91 the three fields @xmath92 carry @xmath93 charge @xmath94 and are necessary for the @xmath95 breaking . the final higgs field , @xmath96 is neutral under @xmath93 .",
    "its vevs do not increase the symmetry breaking but they are important contributors to fermion mass generation .",
    "as will be detailed later , we shall be considering the limit in which this sector decouples entirely from the brane , and so the addition of these scalars does not pose a complication",
    ".    the effect of these fields can be ascertained from the kinetic sector of our action .",

    "the brane localised mass terms for the gauge fields become larger and their wavefunctions are eventually expelled from the brane",
    ". a similar mass shift can be induced by the boundary conditions on the @xmath78 fields .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : vdef ] , the association of @xmath106 with the vevs of the boundary scalar sector implies that the limit @xmath118 is attained when @xmath119 .",
    "however , when the vevs of the higgs fields are taken to infinity , the shift in the kk masses of the gauge fields is finite , giving the exotic gauge fields masses dependent only upon the compactification scale @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , these fields remain as ingredients in the effective theory while the boundary higgs sector decouples entirely , and we can view our reduced symmetry theory in an effective higgless limit .",
    "interestingly , in this limit also , the high - energy behaviour of the massive gauge boson scattering remains unspoilt as shown in  @xcite .",
    "depending on the exact nature of @xmath106 , a shift can be induced in the kk towers of the gauge fields generating a greater symmetry breaking than the orbifold compactification .",
    "the gauge fields are decomposed into one of six possible kk towers depending on the orbifold and boundary conditions , and we need to choose the latter such that the @xmath120 gauge fields are exiled from the brane , while those corresponding to the @xmath121 symmetry remain unperturbed .",
    "given that the structure of the breaking parameter @xmath106 is predetermined by the higgs fields , the desired boundary constraints can be satisfied with our scalar fields acquiring vevs of the form @xmath122 the fields @xmath92 and @xmath96 have a @xmath93 charge of @xmath94 and @xmath123 respectively , where these assignments and the vev structure are motivated by the embedding of the fields in the conventional quartification models  @xcite .",
    "these fields transform trivially under @xmath124 and thus the gauge fields defining these symmetries remain unaffected by the scalars .",
    "the @xmath125 gauge fields , however , are subject to the constraint @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a matrix in the space of these fields . for the non - abelian components",

    "the hypercharge gauge field is @xmath134 and this must remain massless in the low - energy theory .",

    "furthermore , the only scalar that has a massless mode transforms as an @xmath68 doublet ( and its conjugate ) .",

    "we now briefly comment on 5d quartified models which do not have a residual leptonic @xmath142 symmetry , i.e. @xmath3 . there exists only a limited approach to extend upon the previous scheme in which this symmetry remained in the low energy theory .",
    "we require the breaking of the leptonic symmetry to be achieved by a combination of the orbifolding and brane localised scalar fields .    to obtain a consistent low - energy model the orbifold projections must be @xmath143 which break the quartification symmetry to @xmath144 on the matter brane .",
    "as the quarks are singlets under leptonic colour , we still require the full @xmath67 symmetry on the brane and the fields @xmath145 and @xmath146 to generate mass terms .",
    "hence , our quark sector will be identical to that of the previous model . to instigate the breaking to the sm gauge group",

    "the remaining three eigenvalues per family are all of gut scale .",
    "the neutral particles again have dirac masses , with four of the eigenvalues at the gut scale , and the other of ew order which we identify with the neutrino .",
    "thus the brane localised higgs fields break the symmetry down to the sm gauge group and deliver mass terms to the exotic particles . at the electroweak scale , the theory comprises of the minimal sm particle spectrum and the right - handed neutrino .",
    "the exotic fermions all have heavy masses , and are decoupled from the theory in the higgsless limit .    above the compactification scale",
    ", the excitation modes of the sm gauge fields and the multiplet containing the sm higgs field appear at each @xmath151 level .",

    "we have investigated the prospects for unification with this new symmetry framework .",
    "we find that the fewer states contributing at each @xmath153 level fail to sway the coupling constants to unify in a phenomenologically consistent fashion .",
    "the couplings converge only when @xmath156 .",
    "however , for compactification scales this large , the unification always occurs at energies greater than the 5d planck scale and so can not result .",
    "it is interesting that unification within our 5d framework requires @xmath5 to remain as an exact symmetry .",
    "we have shown that unification can be achieved within a five dimensional quartification model . before concluding we shall contrast the 5d construct with the conventional quartification models of  @xcite .",
    "our intention is to draw the readers attention to the advantages and disadvantages of each approach .",
    "let us first consider the case of unbroken @xmath5 . in the 4d case unification could be achieved with four distinct models , each differing in their symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "no predictions regarding the favourability of the distinct models was possible with all of these models permitting a flexible range of symmetry breaking scales consistent with unification .",
    "however intermediate symmetry breaking scales were required , otherwise unification mandates the inclusion of 14 - 37 sm higgs doublets .",
    "the models with intermediate breaking scales required eight distinct scalar @xmath14 multiplets ( related by the cyclic @xmath12 symmetry ) , and these naturally returned seven sm higgs doublets .",
    "furthermore , this results in complicated higgs potentials with many arbitrary parameters .",
    "these parameters must be tuned to generate the desired stages of symmetry breaking , with further assumptions required to ensure that the masses of the scalars were consistent with unification .",
    "the gut scale was found to lie in the range @xmath157  gev and proton decay inducing scalars were required to be of order the gut scale to ensure proton longevity .",
    "finally we note that several of the 4d models predicted that the @xmath158 @xmath159 and @xmath160 bosons should be order tev and are thus observable at the lhc .",
    "we contrast this with the 5d case . here",
    "the demands of a realistic sm fermion spectrum restricted the intermediate symmetry group on the matter brane @xmath90 , resulting in just one feasible choice , namely @xmath161 .",
    "we have shown that unification can be achieved via this route , occurring for a range of compactification scales , @xmath162  gev .",
    "only one sm higgs doublet arose in the 5d construct and this was adequate to achieve unification .",
    "the reduced symmetry operative on the matter brane meant that brane localised scalars need not fill out entire @xmath14 representations .",
    "thus no coloured scalars were required and the proton was found to be stable .",
    "this has the advantage of permitting unification at low scales ( relative to typical 4d unification scales ) .",
    "the 5d framework naturally motivates the intermediate mass scales necessary for unification .",
    "these are introduced in a somewhat ad hoc way in 4d constructs , but here they arise as kk excitations of bulk fields . thus all intermediate mass scales are set by the one parameter , @xmath117 , and the inclusion of intermediate mass scales does nt imply an increase in parameter numbers . as we consider the higgsless limit",
    "the complications which arise in the higgs sector of 4d models essentially disappear .",
    "however , no new phenomenology appears in our model until the scale @xmath117 and given the large @xmath117 values required to achieve unification this prohibits the observation of any new particles at the lhc .",
    "this is similar to the 5d trinification models of  @xcite which reproduce the minimal supersymmetric sm at low energies but predict no additional phenomenology .",
    "the 4d models with broken @xmath5 found to unify in  @xcite possessed essentially the same features as those outlined above for the unbroken @xmath5 case and thus provide no real advantage over these models . given that unification can not be achieved without a remnant @xmath5 symmetry in our 5d model we shall not comment further on these .",
    "we have investigated five dimensional quartification models where the symmetry breaking is achieved by a combination of orbifold compactification and the introduction of a boundary higgs sector .",
    "we have shown that the sm higgs doublet may be identified as the fifth component of a higher dimensional gauge field .",
    "this forces matter to be brane localised , with the sm yukawa structure arising from fermion couplings with wilson line operators .",
    "the models may be considered in a higgsless limit wherein all gauge fields corresponding to generators broken above the electroweak scale have their mass set by the compactification scale . as in 4d models ,",
    "intermediate mass scales were required to ensure unification .",
    "however only one arbitrary scale , namely the compactification scale , was required , with the embedding of the quartification model in a higher dimensional framework naturally introducing a new class of threshold corrections to the running coupling constants , corresponding to kk excitations of bulk gauge fields .",
    "surprisingly we found that a unique symmetry breaking pattern consistent with both unification and phenomenological demands emerged from our framework .",
    "this required @xmath5 to remain as an exact low - energy symmetry and differed markedly from the 4d case where multiple symmetry breaking routes consistent with unification have been found for both broken and unbroken @xmath5 models .",
    "importantly the higher dimensional model alleviates the complications arising from the higgs sector of 4d models by rendering this sector supplementary .",

    "<S> we investigate quartification models in five dimensions , with the fifth dimension forming an @xmath0 orbifold . </S>",
    "<S> the orbifold construction is combined with a boundary higgs sector to break the quartified gauge group directly to a group @xmath1 which is operative at the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the standard model gauge group , and find that unification occurs only when the remnant leptonic colour symmetry @xmath5 remains unbroken . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the demands of a realistic low energy fermion spectrum specify a unique symmetry breaking route for the unifying case of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast this with four dimensional quartification models where unification may be achieved via a number of different symmetry breaking routes both with and without the remnant @xmath5 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary higgs sector of our model may be decoupled to achieve a higgsless limit and we show that the electroweak higgs doublet may be identified as the fifth component of a higher dimensional gauge field . </S>"
