    "the bright 5.75  ms pulsar j04374715 was discovered by johnston et al .",
    "( 1993 ) during the parkes survey for millisecond pulsars .",
    "the pulsar is in a 5.74  d binary orbit with a cool ( @xmath13  k ) , low - mass ( @xmath14 ) white dwarf companion and is surrounded by a bow - shock nebula ( becker et al .",
    "1993 ; bailyn 1993 ; bell , bailes & bessel 1993 ; danziger , baade & della valle 1993 ; bell et al .",
    "it is an old object , with a characteristic age @xmath15  yr , low magnetic field @xmath16  g , and rotational energy loss @xmath17  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "the observed dispersion measure of 2.65  pc  @xmath18 implies a distance @xmath19  pc , making this the closest known millisecond pulsar .",
    "sandhu et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported the distance @xmath20  pc , from parallax measurements .",
    "the pulsar shows significant radio emission over at least 80% of the pulse period , with a complicated mean pulse shape varying with radio frequency .",
    "variation of the linear polarization position angle within the mean pulse interpreted in terms of the rotating vector model ( radhakrishnan & cooke 1969 ) yields the angle between the observer s line of sight and the rotation axis , @xmath21 , and the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes , @xmath22 ( manchester & johnston 1995 ) .",
    "@xmath0 observations of   with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) have revealed ( becker & trmper 1993 ; hereafter bt93 ) that this is also a bright ( count rate @xmath23  s@xmath12 ) soft x - ray pulsar with a single broad pulse and a pulsed fraction @xmath24 in the pspc energy range @xmath25  kev .",
    "bt93 found that the pulsed fraction varies with photon energy @xmath26 and peaks in the range @xmath27  kev , reaching @xmath28 .",
    "although the pulsar spectrum can be fitted with a single power law , indicative of a non - thermal origin of the soft x - ray radiation , the energy dependence of the pulsed fraction in the narrow energy range makes this interpretation hardly plausible .",
    "bt93 showed also that a single blackbody model does not fit the pspc spectrum leaving a residual hard excess above 0.4  kev .",
    "they suggested that the spectrum can consist of two components : a power law , representing magnetospheric or nebular emission , and a blackbody component of the temperature @xmath29  k emitted from an area of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) ; this thermal component was suggested by bt93 to be radiated from a hot spot on the neutron star ( ns ) surface .",
    "was also detected with the @xmath1 deep survey instrument ( dsi ) in the lexan band filter ( @xmath32  kev ) by edelstein , foster & bowyer ( 1995 ) and halpern , martin & marshall ( 1996 ; hereafter hmm96 ) . according to edelstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the dsi count rate of the source is @xmath33  s@xmath12 , whereas hmm96 report the count rate of @xmath34  s@xmath12 obtained with a much longer exposure ( 496  ks vs.  72  ks ) .",
    "edelstein et al .  ( 1995 ) ruled out the single power - law spectral model based on the improbably high hydrogen column density , @xmath35  @xmath9 , required by this model .",
    "they claimed that both the @xmath0 flux below 0.4  kev and the @xmath1 flux could arise from an isothermal blackbody with a temperature @xmath36  k , an emitting area of @xmath37  km@xmath38 , and an absorbing column of @xmath39  @xmath9 . on the other hand , hmm96 concluded that the combined analysis of the @xmath0 spectrum and @xmath1 flux is consistent with a single power - law spectrum of photon index @xmath40 and intervening column density @xmath41  @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , the combined data can be interpreted as comprised of two components , e.  g. , a power law and a blackbody component emitted from a hot polar cap of radius 50600  m and temperature @xmath42  k. hmm96 observed the pulsar in the high time resolution mode , which enabled them to obtain the light curve and to measure the pulsed fraction @xmath43 in the @xmath1 dsi spectral range .",
    "thus , although very important data have been collected and analyzed , the true nature of the soft x - ray radiation from   remains elusive .",
    "the only firmly established facts are that the radiation is pulsed ( pulsed fraction apparently depends on energy ) , and the spectrum can not be fitted with a single blackbody model .",
    "the main question is whether the radiation is of a nonthermal ( magnetospheric ? nebular ? )",
    "origin or at least a fraction of it can be interpreted as thermal ( or thermal - like ) radiation from some heated regions ( polar caps ? ) on the ns surface .",
    "virtually all the ( different ) models of radio pulsars ( e.  g. , cheng & ruderman 1980 ; arons 1981 ; michel 1991 ; beskin , gurevich & istomin 1993 ) predict these objects to have _ polar caps _ ( pcs ) around the ns magnetic poles heated up to x - ray temperatures by relativistic particles and gamma - quanta impinging onto the pole regions from the acceleration zones .",
    "a conventional assumption about the pc radius is that it is close to the radius within which open magnetic field lines originate from the ns surface . for",
    ", it gives @xmath44 km .",
    "expected pc temperatures , @xmath45  k , and luminosities , @xmath46  erg  s@xmath12 , are much less certain , being strongly dependent on the specific pulsar model .",
    "thus , one can not firmly predict pc properties because of the lack of a well - established pulsar model  rather a theoretical model should be chosen based on x - ray observations of radio pulsars .",
    "x - ray observations of other old pulsars ( e.  g. , psr b1929 + 10  yancopoulos , hamilton & helfand 1994 ; psr b0950 + 08  manning & willmore 1994 ) do show pulsed x - ray radiation which , in principle , could be the thermal pc radiation .",
    "however , the number of photons collected has been too small to make firm conclusions , and the opposite hypothesis , that this radiation is of a magnetospheric origin ( gelman 1995 ; becker & trmper 1997 ",
    "hereafter bt97 ) , can not be excluded . in principle",
    ", one could also observe the pc radiation from younger pulsars and use these data to discriminate between different pc models .",
    "indeed , there are some indications that hard components of the soft x - ray spectra of , e.  g. , psr b0656 + 14 and psr b105552 ( greiveldinger et al .",
    "1996 ) may consist of two subcomponents , a power law and a thermal subcomponent corresponding to emission from pcs of temperatures @xmath47  k ( for psr b0656 + 14 ) and @xmath48  k ( for psr b105552 ) .",
    "this interpretation , however , is not unique because it is difficult to separate the hard component from the soft one which is believed to originate from the ( cooler ) entire ns surface , and even more difficult to separate the two subcomponents of the hard spectral tail",
    ".    one can not also exclude _ a priori _ that the nonthermal radiation from the pulsar magnetosphere or a pulsar - powered compact nebula contributes to , or even dominates , the observed soft x - ray flux of .",
    "it is natural to assume that the spectrum of this radiation can be approximated by a power law in the relatively short @xmath1-@xmath0 range .",
    "one could also expect the magnetospheric ( but not nebular ) radiation to be pulsed with the radio pulsar period ; the pulses should be , as a rule , narrower than those of the thermal pc radiation , and the shape of the light curve should not vary considerably with photon energy . thus , if more data confirm the conclusion of bt93 that the pulsed fraction depends on @xmath26 , the radiation of   should either be thermal or consist of the thermal and nonthermal components . in the latter case , since the sources of the thermal and nonthermal radiation are expected to be spatially separated , it is natural to expect that pulsations of these two components should be phase - shifted due to the difference of travel times and aberration .",
    "for instance , if the nonthermal component is generated at a distance comparable to the light cylinder radius ( @xmath49 cm ) , the time delay leads to a phase shift of about 0.2 of the pulsar period .",
    "no energy - dependent phase shifts have been reported for this source , although it can be explained by the poor photon statistics in hard pspc channels .",
    "as in the case of thermal pc radiation , the current theoretical models of nonthermal high - energy pulsar emission ( e.  g. , sturner , dermer & michel 1995 ; romani 1996 ) are not enough elaborated to predict the intensity , spectrum and light curve for a given pulsar .",
    "there exist empirical formulae",
    "( seward & wang 1988 ; gelman 1995 ; bt97 ) which relate the ( presumably nonthermal ) x - ray luminosity to the pulsar parameters , e.  g. , to the period and magnetic field .",
    "for instance , gelman ( 1995 ) pointed out that the observed soft x - ray luminosities satisfy , for 7 pulsars , the following equation : @xmath50  erg  s@xmath51 .",
    "bt97 fitted the luminosities of 26 pulsars observed in the @xmath0 range with the dependence @xmath52 .",
    "these pulsars represent a very wide range of spin - down luminosities ( @xmath53  erg  s@xmath12 ) , ages ( @xmath54  yr ) , magnetic field strength ( @xmath55  g ) and spin periods ( @xmath56  ms ) .",
    "the inferred dependence indicates that for most pulsars the bulk of observed radiation is directly connected with pulsar mechanisms , i.  e. , with production and acceleration of relativistic particles which carry away the ns rotational energy . the fact that x - rays from some of these pulsars ( e.  g. , crab ) are certainly nonthermal may allow one to assume that the radiation detected with the @xmath0 from most pulsars is of a nonthermal origin . on the other hand",
    ", a correlation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 should take place also for radiation emitted by the pulsar pcs because their ( thermal ) luminosity is also provided by relativistic particles generated in the magnetosphere and accelerated towards the ns surface , so that the pc luminosity should be a fraction of @xmath58 which goes to heating of the pcs .",
    "moreover , both theoretical ( see section 5.1 ) and observational estimates of the pc luminosities may happen to be very close to the values predicted by the @xmath59 dependence obtained by bt97 .",
    "for instance , the luminosity of the thermal component in the power - law plus blackbody fit for , @xmath60  erg  s@xmath12 ( bt93 ) , is close to the predicted value , @xmath61  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "another example is psr b1929 + 10 whose luminosity @xmath62  erg  s@xmath12 inferred from the blackbody fit of both @xmath0 and @xmath63 data ( yancopoulos et al .",
    "1994 ; wang & halpern 1997 ) perfectly matches the dependence derived by bt97 . in general case , we may expect that the pulsar x - ray radiation contains both thermal ( pc ) and nonthermal components , both growing with @xmath58 , and the relation between the thermal and nonthermal fluxes may be different for different objects , depending , in addition to @xmath58 , on other intrinsic pulsar parameters ( e.  g. , pulsar period @xmath64 , magnetic inclination @xmath65 ) , as well as on the rotational inclination @xmath66 ( because the radiation beam widths are different for the thermal and nonthermal components ) .",
    "thus , one can not rule out that the pc component dominates in some cases , and we explore this possibility for .",
    "an important evidence on the nature of radiation of   could come from deep observations of its high - energy tail , at energies above @xmath67  kev .",
    "although this object has been detected by @xmath63 ( two 20  ks observations ) below 3  kev , the results are still not very conclusive because of poor choice of observing modes which did not take into account the presence of a neighboring seyfert galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , preliminary results show that a spectrum of @xmath68 pulsar photons extracted from the ccd away from the seyfert galaxy is softer than a power law and resembles more a thermal - like spectrum ( kawai , tamura & saito 1996 ) .",
    "this conclusion , however , needs verification based on longer pointed observations in a mode minimizing contamination from the seyfert .",
    "the conclusion of bt93 and hmm96 that the pspc spectrum of   can not be fitted with a single thermal component is based on the assumption that its spectrum coincides with the spectrum of the blackbody radiation .",
    "however , spectra emitted by real bodies , including stars , are always different from the planck spectrum .",
    "in particular , if the temperature of a stellar atmosphere grows inward , and the absorption coefficient decreases with frequency ( e.  g. , @xmath69 for the kramers law ) , then the spectrum is harder than the blackbody spectrum at high frequencies because we see deeper and hotter layers .",
    "this means that if a ns is covered with a fully ionized plasma , whose opacity can be described by the kramers law , its spectrum is substantially harder at high energies , @xmath70 ( e.  g. , pavlov & shibanov 1978 ) .",
    "this general property has been demonstrated in models of hydrogen and helium atmospheres of cooling nss by romani ( 1987 ) , pavlov et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , rajagopal & romani  ( 1996 ) , zavlin , pavlov & shibanov ( 1996 ; hereafter zps96 ) . one can expect that a ns has a purely hydrogen atmosphere if it experienced accretion of the interstellar matter  heavy elements of the accreted matter sink down rapidly due to the strong ns gravitation ( alcock & illarionov 1980 ) .",
    "since   is a very old object , it is quite plausible that it accreted some matter during its long life , and in this case we may expect that the excess of the observed flux at @xmath71  kev is due to the fact that , including its pcs , is covered by a fully ionized hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "the pc radiation should be inevitably pulsed unless the rotation axis coincides with either the line of sight or the magnetic axis .",
    "if it were the blackbody radiation , the shape of the light curves and the pulsed fraction @xmath72 would remain the same at all photon energies @xmath26 .",
    "however , the atmosphere radiation has a very important feature  it is anisotropic , with anisotropy ( and consequently light curves ) depending on energy ( pavlov et al .  1994 ; shibanov et al .  1995 ; zps96 ) .",
    "this dependence is different for different chemical compositions and surface temperatures .",
    "e.  g. , for atmospheres with relatively high temperatures @xmath73  k consisting of light elements ( hydrogen , helium ) , the anisotropy increases with increasing @xmath26 in the soft x - ray range .",
    "this also makes the spectra dependent on the rotation phase .",
    "the inter - dependence of the spectral and angular distributions means that the proper interpretation of the observed pc radiation implies fitting of _ both the spectra and the light curves with the same pc model_.    the above - described properties of radiation emitted by a pc covered with an atmosphere warrant a new investigation of the soft x - ray radiation observed from , based on the ns atmosphere models . to perform this investigation",
    ", we used the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data analyzed previously by bt93 and hmm96 and combined with the results of new observations carried out with the @xmath0 high - resolution imager ( hri ) and @xmath0 pspc ( becker et al .",
    "these observations are briefly described in section  2 .",
    "we show that with allowance for the properties of ns atmosphere radiation these joint @xmath0 and @xmath1 data can be interpreted as thermal radiation of two pcs , _ without invoking an additional nonthermal component_. in section  3 we explore a simplest single - temperature pc model which assumes that both pcs have equal radii @xmath74 and uniform temperatures @xmath75 , whereas the rest part of the ns surface has a much lower temperature and is invisible in x - rays .",
    "since the magnetic field of   is very low , it can not affect the radiative properties of the pc atmospheres .",
    "therefore , we use the low - field atmosphere models developed by zps96 . to calculate the flux as measured by a distant observer",
    ", we integrate the specific flux over the visible pc surface with allowance for the gravitational redshift and bending of the photon trajectories . for the case of small pcs ( @xmath76 ) with uniform temperatures , a convenient expression for the observable flux",
    "is given by zavlin , pavlov & shibanov ( 1995 ; see their eq .",
    "[ a15 ] ) ) .",
    "we show that this simple model is generally consistent with the observational data if the pcs are covered with hydrogen or helium , whereas the iron atmosphere model does not fit the spectra ( cf .",
    "pavlov et al .",
    "for the hydrogen and helium models , we estimate @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the interstellar hydrogen column density , @xmath77 .",
    "the fit with the simplest pc model is still not perfect .",
    "this is not surprising because it is hard to expect the real pcs to be uniformly heated . on the contrary , due to higher heat conduction of subphotospheric layers , where the energy of accreting relativistic particles is released",
    ", the heat can propagate along the surface , eventually heating surface layers out of the `` primary '' hot spot .",
    "this should result in a larger hot region with the temperature decreasing outward .",
    "in fact , this mechanism should be more efficient just for low - field pulsars because the strong magnetic fields of ordinary pulsars greatly reduce the transverse conductivity ( e.  g. , hernquist 1985 ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there have been no reliable calculations of the temperature distribution around the pulsar magnetic poles .",
    "thus , to include this effect into consideration , we explore in section  4 a simple model : the distribution is assumed to be a two - step function ( `` core+rim '' ) with two temperatures , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and two radii , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we show that this model is fairly consistent , for hydrogen - covered pcs , with all the data available .",
    "we discuss the results and implications of our interpretation in section  5 and draw conclusions in section  6 .",
    "we used two data sets obtained during pointed pspc observations ( total @xmath82 counts ) and one data set obtained with hri ( @xmath83 counts ) ; the corresponding count rates are @xmath84  s@xmath12 and @xmath85  s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "details of these observations are described by bt93 and becker et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "since no source counts were detected in the pspc pulse height channels above channel 200 , and the pspc response matrix is not sufficiently known for softest channels , we used channels 10200 ( @xmath86  kev ) for our spectral and temporal analysis .",
    "we manually binned the count spectrum into 49 energy bins with the signal - to - noise ratio between 4 and 9 and used this binning for the spectral fitting with the aid of the midas / exsas software ( zimmerman et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we used the pspc and hri temporal dependences of the source count rate folded with the radio pulsar period by becker et al .",
    "the pspc light curves were extracted in 0.10.6 , 0.61.1 , 1.12.0 and 0.12.0  kev energy ranges ( 13 , 9 , 9 and 17 phase bins , respectively ) .",
    "the shapes of the light curves from the second data set were compared with those of the first set using a @xmath87 test .",
    "the analysis showed that the light curves from both sets of the pspc data are consistent with each other with a probability @xmath88 , that justifies summation of the light curves from the two pspc observations .",
    "the combined pspc light curves show an evidence that the pulsed fraction @xmath72 depends on energy , in accordance with the dependence reported by bt93 for the first data set . defining @xmath72 in the standard way ,",
    "as the fraction of the total counts lying above the light curve minimum , we obtained an increase from @xmath89% at 0.10.6  kev to @xmath90% at 0.61.1  kev .",
    "formally , in the 1.12.0  kev range the pulsed fraction reaches @xmath91% , but this value should be considered with caution because of poor statistics ( @xmath92 counts in this range ) .",
    "the pulsed fraction in the total energy range is @xmath93% .",
    "no phase shifts between the light curves in different energy ranges were found ( cf .",
    "bt93 ) .",
    "although the estimated @xmath72 values indicate that the light curves have different shapes in different energy ranges , they suffer from large uncertainties of the number of counts in the phase bins corresponding to the minima of the observed light curves , being thereby not very reliable estimators . besides , light curves with equal @xmath72 can have quite different shapes .",
    "therefore , an independent statistical test is needed to ascertain and quantify statistically the difference of the light curve shapes .",
    "the same @xmath87 test shows that the probability that the shapes of the light curves in different ranges are _ different _ is generally high , between 77% and 92% .",
    "although the difference might be partly due to systematic uncertainties , we believe that the dependence of the light curve shapes and pulsed fractions on energy is statistically reliable ( at least , it can not be rejected on statistical grounds ) and can be considered as an additional argument in favor of thermal origin of the soft x - ray radiation from .    the hri light curve folded with the radio pulsar period and binned into 11 phase bins results in the pulsed fraction @xmath94% .",
    "we used the observational data kindly provided by jules halpern and described in detail by hmm96 .",
    "the total of @xmath95 source counts were collected at the source count rate of @xmath96  s@xmath12 .",
    "this uncertainty ( @xmath97 ) is due to statistics only ; a systematic uncertainty may be as high as 1520% ( bowyer et al .",
    "the produced light curve with 20 phase bins yields the pulsed fraction @xmath98% .",
    "= 8.5 cm      a power law with the photon index @xmath99 , intrinsic source luminosity @xmath100  erg  s@xmath12 in 0.1 - 2.0  kev and @xmath101  @xmath9 provides an acceptable ( @xmath102 ) fit to the combined pspc spectrum .",
    "the parameter values are generally consistent with those obtained by bt93 and hmm96 : @xmath103 , @xmath104  @xmath9 , @xmath105  erg  s@xmath12 , and @xmath106 , @xmath107  @xmath9 , @xmath108  erg  s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the best power - law fit to the combined pspc spectrum yields the hri count rate @xmath109  s@xmath12 , which is compatible with the measured value of @xmath85  s@xmath12 .",
    "folding the same model with the @xmath1 dsi response gives the count rate @xmath110  s@xmath12 , which is about 20% lower than the observed value .",
    "following hmm96 , we tested whether or not the single power - law fits to the pspc spectrum can be consistent with the dsi flux .",
    "we folded each of the trial spectra on a grid of the fitting parameters @xmath111 and @xmath77 through the effective area curve of dsi and obtained a corresponding grid of predicted dsi count rates .",
    "figure  1 presents the 68% , 90% and 99% confidence contours of the pspc fits in the @xmath111-@xmath77 plane , together with the bands allowed by estimated systematic uncertainties of the dsi response .",
    "figure  1 shows that our joint pspc+dsi analysis restricts the hydrogen column density to @xmath112  @xmath9 , at a 90% confidence level .",
    "this restriction is compatible with that of hmm96 , @xmath41  @xmath9 , obtained with almost thrice lower number of the pspc counts .",
    "it should be noted , however , that if one adopts the 2% statistical uncertainty for the dsi domain , it does not overlap the 68% pspc confidence ellipse , so that the joint analysis of the pspc and dsi data hints that the power - law spectral model may be only _ marginally _ acceptable .",
    "this can be considered as one more reason to test _ thermal _ models for the soft x - ray radiation of .",
    "in this section we analyze the above - described data in terms of the simplest one - component thermal model .",
    "we assume that the observed radiation is emitted by two symmetric , uniformly heated pcs around the ( dipole ) magnetic poles .",
    "we consider three chemical compositions for the pc atmospheres , and , for the sake of comparison , the blackbody model for the pc radiation .",
    "the fitting parameters for this model are @xmath77 , the pc ( effective ) temperature @xmath75 , and the ratio @xmath113 .",
    "the radius @xmath74 is defined as the distance from the cap edge to the magnetic axis .",
    "we fix the distance to the pulsar , @xmath114  pc ( a most probable value , according to sandhu et al .",
    "1997 ) , and present the results for @xmath74 and pc luminosity for this distance . since the atmosphere spectra and , particularly , light curves depend on the viewing angle , the directions of the magnetic and rotation axes are to be specified .",
    "we adopt , for most of our fits , @xmath115 for the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight , and @xmath116 for the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes ( manchester & johnston 1995 ) .",
    "to specify the gravitational acceleration for calculating the atmosphere models , and the ns mass - to - radius ratio for account of the gravitational bending of the photon trajectories , we adopt @xmath117 and @xmath118  km for the ns mass and radius .",
    "all temperatures and radii here and below are as measured at the pulsar surface .",
    "fitting the combined pspc spectrum with four models for the pc radiation yields the following results .    _",
    "blackbody_. in agreement with what was found by bt93 and confirmed later by hmm96 for the first pspc data set , the single blackbody model fails to fit the combined pspc spectrum ( minimum @xmath119 ) because the blackbody spectrum is too soft ( steep ) at high energies and leaves too large residuals at @xmath120  kev ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "formally , the fit yields @xmath121 @xmath9 , @xmath122 and @xmath123  km .",
    "this gives the bolometric luminosity of two pcs @xmath124  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "_ iron atmosphere_. because of numerous spectral lines quasi - randomly distrubuted at @xmath125  kev , the smoothed spectra emitted by iron atmospheres in the soft x - ray range are not much different from blackbody spectra at the same temperatures ( rajagopal & romani 1996 ; zps96 ) .",
    "the spectral lines of iron atmosphere spectra can not be detected by @xmath0 due to its poor energy resolution .",
    "the spectral fit with the iron atmosphere model ( right panel of fig .",
    "2 ) is even worse than with the blackbody : minimum @xmath126 .",
    "the lower quality of this fit is caused by the fact ( zps96 ) that the iron atmosphere spectra are softer the blackbody spectra in the soft x - ray range at temperatures @xmath73  k.    _ hydrogen atmosphere_. in comparison with the two cases above , the pc model with hydrogen composition gives a much better fit , with minimum @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "since the hydrogen atmosphere spectra , as well as any other thermal spectra , have an intrinsic decrease towards low energies , they fit the observed spectrum at much lower interstellar hydrogen density , @xmath128 @xmath9 .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath129 and @xmath130  km .",
    "since the high - energy tail of the radiation emitted from hydrogen atmospheres is harder than the blackbody tail , the resulting pc temperature is 2.2 times lower than the temperature of the blackbody fit . to provide the same flux",
    ", @xmath74 becomes 4.5 times greater approaching the conventional estimate of @xmath131  km .",
    "the corresponding bolometric luminosity of two pcs is @xmath132  erg  s@xmath12 , comparable with that for the blackbody model .",
    "we checked that the fitting parameters are very stable with respect to the choice of energy channels ( binning ) of the pspc count rate spectrum  only the minimum value of @xmath133 varies slightly .",
    "for example , the fit in 20 - 140 channels ( @xmath134  kev range ) with 19 bins yields the same values of @xmath77 , @xmath75 and @xmath74 , with minimum @xmath135 .    _",
    "helium atmosphere_. for helium - covered pcs ( right panel of fig .",
    "3 ) , the quality of the fit and the values of the model parameters are similar to those for the hydrogen composition .",
    "a smaller value of the minimum @xmath136 is due to the fact that at @xmath137  k the spectrum of the helium atmosphere is slightly harder than that of the hydrogen atmosphere ( zps96 ) .",
    "generally , the fits with hydrogen and helium models are almost indiscernible .",
    "although the hydrogen and helium pc models fit the pspc spectrum much better than the blackbody model , there still is an excess of the observed radiation at @xmath138  kev ( see fig .  3 )",
    ". the excess can be partly due to systematic errors of the high - energy pspc response which may be as high as 20% .",
    "irrespective of that , the excess can be naturally explained by simplicity of the single - temperature pc model  if there is a smaller area of a greater temperature within the pc , it can easily provide the excess high - energy quanta , the possibility we explore in section  4 .",
    "the single - temperature approximation , however , enables us to show that the spectrum can be fitted with a purely thermal model provided that the pcs are covered by a hydrogen or helium atmosphere , whereas the hypothesis about the iron surface of the pcs can be firmly rejected .",
    "( a similar conclusion has been drawn by rajagopal & romani ( 1996 ) who , however , obtained substantially different pc parameters because they fitted the observed spectrum without allowance for the limb - darkening and light bending . )",
    "we do not expect that other heavy - element compositions of the ns surface could fit the observed spectrum  they should also lead to emitted spectra much softer that the spectra of hydrogen or helium atmospheres .",
    "we consider the hydrogen atmosphere more natural that the helium one ( e.  g. , if the atmosphere was formed due to accretion of the hydrogen - rich interstellar matter or matter from the binary companion ) , and we explore consistency of this hypothesis with the hri and dsi results , as well as with the light curves observed with the three instruments .",
    "figure  4 shows the confidence contours for the parameters of the hydrogen pc fit to the pspc spectrum .",
    "we checked that any point from the 99% pspc confidence region produces the model hri count rate within the observed range .",
    "the best parameters of the pspc spectral fit give a too high count rate for the @xmath1 dsi , 0.01136  s@xmath12 , which does not even get into the @xmath139% systematic uncertainty range around the observed value .",
    "the reason is that the formal best fit yields @xmath140 ( no interstellar absorption ) , which clearly is not a realistic value .",
    "however , @xmath77 is determined with some uncertainties , and even a small value of @xmath77 can noticeably decrease the dsi flux and make the dsi and pspc count rates consistent with each other .",
    "similar to the case of the power - law model ( section  2 ) , we computed the bands in the parameter planes allowed by the observed dsi flux .",
    "the thick dot - dash lines in fig .",
    "4 correspond to the dsi count rates of @xmath34  cnts / s .",
    "the shaded regions show the domains of the model parameters allowed by all the three instruments at the 68% confidence level .",
    "if we adopt the @xmath141 uncertainty for the observed dsi count rate ( thick dots ) , the allowed regions become much broader .",
    "thus , there exist a domain of the model parameters compatible with all of the detected count rates and with the pspc spectra : @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the corresponding area and bolometric luminosity of two pcs are @xmath145  km@xmath38 and @xmath146  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "similar to the case of the power - law fit , the main role of the @xmath1 data is that these data enable us to restrict the @xmath77 value ; the difference is that for the thermal pc model the range of jointly acceptable @xmath77 values lies above the best - pspc - fit value , and they are an order of magnitude lower than for the joint power - law fit .",
    "this implies a higher ionized fraction , and a lower mean number density of the interstellar hydrogen in the direction to   ( see discussion ) .",
    "the center of the allowed three - dimensional parameter domain is given , approximately , by the following values : @xmath147  @xmath9 , @xmath148 and @xmath149  km , which can be considered as a best joint psps+hri+dsi fit ( marked with crosses in fig .",

    ", we call this set of parameters `` _ the best pc model _ '' for the rest of this section .    = 8.5 cm      now we should test whether the pc model obtained from the analysis of the pspc spectrum and hri and dsi count rates fits the light curves detected with these instruments . to do that , we computed the spectra for 80 rotation phases , @xmath150 , for the best pc model and convolved the spectra at each phase with the pspc , hri and dsi responses .",
    "then , we binned these model count rates into the the phase bins adopted for the observed light curves to compare the light curves with the aid of the @xmath87-test .",
    "the @xmath87 value depends on how we co - align the phases for the model and the observed light curves .",
    "since the reference phases of the observed light curves were chosen arbitrarily , we may vary the phase shift between the model and observed light curves to minimize @xmath87 .",
    "( of course , the shifts in different energy ranges should not differ from each other by more than a fraction of the bin width ; ideally , the difference should be comparable with , or less than , the instrument time resolution ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    figure  5 presents the adjusted model and observed pspc light curves for the four energy ranges .",
    "we define the zero rotation phase as the phase when the angle @xmath151 between the magnetic axis and the line of sight equals its minimum value , @xmath152 ; this phase corresponds to the maximum of the model light curve , whereas the minimum lies at @xmath153 , corresponding to @xmath154 .",
    "the difference of the phase shifts applied to minimize @xmath87 does not exceed 1/80 of the rotational period , which corresponds to 0.07  ms , about one half of the the @xmath0 time resolution . as is seen in fig .  5",
    ", the best pc model yields the light curves in excellent agreement with those observed in the @xmath155 and @xmath27  kev ranges  not only the pulsed fractions are within the statistical uncertainties , but also the @xmath133 values are small enough . for the @xmath156  kev range ,",
    "the model @xmath72 is within the observed uncertainty , but the fit is formally unacceptable ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the aforementioned deficit of pc counts with respect to observed in this energy range .",
    "figure  6 shows the observed @xmath0 hri and @xmath1 dsi light curves it is worth noting that the difference between the phase shift applied to adjust the observed pspc and hri light curves to the model ones is as small as 1/80 .",
    "the coincidence of the model and observed light curves is fairly good for both hri and dsi .",
    "the results above were obtained for @xmath158 , @xmath116 , and the standard ns mass and radius .",
    "the angles , however , are not very certain as this pulsar shows a complicated variation of linear polarization angle across the eight - component mean radio pulse ( manchester & johnston 1995 ) . in principle , the interpretation of the soft x - ray data adopted in the present paper can reduce this uncertainty  one can fit the data with the pc model considering @xmath65 and @xmath66 as fitting parameters .",

    "one more example shown in fig .",
    "7 demonstrates the importance of the gravitational bending of photon trajectories : if this effect is neglected , the best pc model yields a light curve with strong pulsations , @xmath167% , resulting in a great deviation , @xmath168 .",
    "the mass - to - radius ratio can be also considered as a fitting parameter to provide better coincidence of the light curves and put constraints on the equation of state of the ns interiors .",
    "motivated by the results of section  3 , we examine a more complicated pc model which allows , in the first approximation , for a non - uniform temperature distribution along the pc surface .",
    "we adopt a two - step approximation , `` core+rim '' , with @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the definitions of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are analogous to @xmath74 in section  3 .",

    "it is natural to expect that @xmath171 and @xmath172 , where @xmath75 and @xmath74 are the parameters of the one - component pc model , so that the rim and the core should be responsible for the soft and hard spectral components of this two - component model .",
    "we retain the same assumptions on the pulsar angles , mass , radius and distance as earlier .      as one could expect for a two - component model , the iron atmosphere model yields an acceptable fit of the pspc spectrum ( minimum @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) , with the best - fit parameters @xmath175  @xmath9 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178  km and @xmath179  km .",

    "_ the rim can not produce the pulsed fraction _",
    "@xmath180% observed in the 0.10.6  kev range ( the model @xmath72 does not exceed a few percent ) .",

    "thus , we exclude the iron atmosphere model from further consideration , as well as the two - component blackbody model which also leads to @xmath181 .",

    "the corresponding bolometric luminosity of two rims and cores , @xmath188  erg  s@xmath12 ( 51% and 49% from the cores and rims , respectively ) , is close to that of the single - temperature pc model .",

    "although these errors , calculated from the derivatives of the fit statistics , are not reliable , they indicate that the parameters are strongly correlated , and the best fit gives only qualitative estimates of the parameter values . in principle , the parameter ranges can be reduced with the use of the @xmath0 hri and @xmath1 dsi data , but it would require an extremely time - consuming analysis of five - dimensional confidence volumes .",
    "a practical way to solve the problem is prompted by the shapes of the best - fit component spectra  we see that the hot core component gives the main contribution at higher energies , above 0.40.6  kev , whereas the rims are responsible for the flux at lower energies . therefore , we can first fit the hard channels separately with a single - temperature cap model ( notice that @xmath77 of expected magnitudes does not affect spectra at these energies ) , and then fix some set(s ) of @xmath78 and @xmath80 and fit the rim component with the three fitting parameters , @xmath77 , @xmath79 and @xmath81 .",
    "the first step with 21 energy bins in the 53200 channels gives the best - fit parameters of the hot core , @xmath189 and @xmath190  km ( @xmath191 , @xmath192 ) , in accordance with the two - component results .",
    "figure  9 demonstrates the confidence contours for this fit .    at the second step , we fixed the best pair of @xmath78 and @xmath80 obtained at the first step and fitted the total pspc count rate spectrum with the `` core+rim '' model ( the best - fit parameters are given in the right panel of fig .",

    "the projections of the three - dimensional confidence regions for the parameters of the soft component are shown in fig .",
    "the regions are still too broad , in spite of the reduced number of the fitting parameters , because the parameters are strongly correlated ( e.  g , @xmath193 at a given @xmath79 ) due to narrowness of the soft - energy range .",

    "the rim emits 74% of all the pspc counts with @xmath205% at @xmath206  kev , and 87% of counts with @xmath207% in the ds range .",

    "if the correct estimate obtained for the pc luminosity from the slot - gap model is not a chance coincidence , we may expect that the luminosity is scaled as @xmath324 , and the bolometric luminosity from two pcs of psr b182124 can be estimated as @xmath325  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "this estimate is much lower than the luminosity @xmath326  erg s@xmath12 inferred by saito et al .",
    "if we adopt the outer - gap model and assume that the accelerator efficiency is reduced by the same factor for all pulsars , then the luminosity is scaled as @xmath327 , which yields @xmath328  erg  s@xmath12 for psr b182124 , even less than for the slot - gap model .",
    "moreover , even the maximum possible pc luminosity predicted by the outer - gap model remains lower than observed .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the pc radiation is not seen from this pulsar , being overwhelmed by a nonthermal soft x - ray radiation .",
    "saito et al .  ( 1997 ) speculate that the high luminosity of the nonthermal radiation may be associated with large values of the magnetic field at the light cylinder , @xmath329  g , close to that of the crab pulsar and much higher than @xmath330  g for .",
    "the nature of x - ray radiation from other five millisecond pulsars is much less certain because of small numbers of counts detected .",
    "their luminosities in the @xmath0 range , inferred under the assumption of a power - law spectrum with the photon index @xmath331 , obey the same dependence , @xmath332 , as ordinary pulsars ( bt97 ) , and they are greater than the pc luminosities predicted for these objects by the slot - gap model ( scaled to ) .",
    "however , the ratios of the observed to predicted luminosities , ranging from @xmath333 for psr j1012 + 5307 to @xmath334 for psr j0751 + 1907 , are smaller than @xmath335 for psr b182124 .",
    "since the power - law model always yields a higher luminosity than the pc model ( because of higher @xmath77 needed to suppress the intrinsically high low - energy flux ) , one may expect that the luminosities inferred from the pc interpretation would be compatible with those predicted by equation ( 3 ) .",
    "in addition , as arons ( 1981 ) emphasizes , equation ( 3 ) gives a _ minimum _ expected luminosity  although the luminosity of   coincides with that minimum , pc luminosities of other pulsars may be greater .",
    "thus , the soft x - ray radiation of at least some other millisecond pulsars can be partly supplied by their pcs , although a nonthermal component may also be present and may even dominate . to resolve the dilemma , and to separate the two components ,",
    "further observations are needed . at present",
    ", we can only say that both possibilities should be explored , and complementary interpretations are still viable for some pulsars .",
    "we have shown that both the spectra and the light curves of the soft x - ray radiation of   observed with the @xmath0 pspc and hri and @xmath1 dsi can be interpreted as _ thermal radiation from two hydrogen - covered polar caps_. the simplest , single - temperature pc model allows us to estimate typical pc radius , @xmath336  km , and temperature , @xmath337  k. the successful fitting of the data with the two - temperature model indicates that the pc temperature may be non - uniform , decreasing from @xmath338  k at a pc core with a typical size @xmath339  m down to @xmath340  k at a much greater radius @xmath341  km , so that the heated area may comprise a considerable fraction of the ns surface .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the two pcs is @xmath342  erg  s@xmath12 , that is @xmath343 of the total energy loss of the pulsar is absorbed and re - emitted by the pcs .",
    "we emphasize that the proposed interpretation is based essentially upon the _ neutron star atmosphere models _  the data can not be interpreted as purely thermal pc radiation with the simplistic blackbody model .",
    "moreover , with the aid of the ns atmosphere models we show that the emitting layers should be depleted of heavy elements , which can be naturally explained by the plausible assumption that the old ns has experienced accretion of the hydrogen - rich matter during its long life - time .",
    "the successful fits of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 light curves in different energy ranges with the pc models are possible only if the energy - dependent limb - darkening of the hydrogen atmospheres is taken into account .",
    "the shape of the light curves is also very sensitive to the bending of photon trajectories in the strong gravitational field of the ns and to the orientations of the rotational and magnetic axes of the pulsar .",
    "we obtained the satisfactory fits assuming @xmath344 and @xmath345  km , with the magnetic inclination angle , @xmath116 , and viewing angle , @xmath158 , inferred from radio observations .",
    "we have demonstrated that the effect of the gravitational bending on the light curves can provide important information on the ns mass - to - radius ratio .",
    "the hydrogen column density towards the , @xmath346  @xmath9 , as well as strong ionization of hydrogen , @xmath347 , estimated from the pc model fits are consistent with the ism properties obtained from observations of other objects in the vicinity of the pulsar , whereas the power - law fit yields greater @xmath77 and lower @xmath348 .",
    "this can be considered as one more argument in favor of thermal origin of the x - ray radiation of .    the inferred pc temperature , radius and , especially , luminosity are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the slot - gap pulsar model ( arons 1981 ) .",
    "the upper limit on the pc luminosity provided by the outer - gap pulsar model ( cheng et al .",
    "1986 ) exceeds the observed value .",
    "this model becomes compatible with our results if a reduced efficiency of the particle accelerator , consistent with the upper limit on the gamma - ray flux from the pulsar , is assumed .",
    "radio pulsar models predict that heated pcs is a common phenomenon inherent to all active pulsars . by virtue of this ,",
    "the dependence @xmath349 found by bt97 for 26 pulsars detected with the @xmath0 determines a fraction of the rotational energy loss re - emitted in x - rays _ by both nonthermal and thermal processes_. contributions of these two mechanisms to the total x - ray flux depend on various factors , such as pulsar period , radius , magnetic field , etc . in some pulsars ( e.  g. , psr b182124 ) the thermal - like soft x - ray radiation from pcs may happen to be less intensive than the nonthermal radiation generated in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "for instance , both the slot - gap and outer - gap models predict the luminosity of pcs of psr b182124 much lower than the luminosity observed with the @xmath0 and @xmath63 .",
    "although all the available observations of   are consistent with the suggested pc interpretation , and this interpretation is supported by the theoretical pulsar models and by indirect arguments , we still can not completely exclude that the same data , collected in the relatively narrow energy range , could be interpreted with another model  for instance , as a combination of the pc radiation and magnetospheric radiation .",
    "hence , the proposed interpretation can be considered as complementary to the nonthermal interpretation discussed by bt97 . a crucial test",
    "would be provided by observations of this object at energies @xmath350  kev , which would enable one to firmly discriminate between the power - law and thermal - like spectra , or to separate their contributions .",
    "such observations could be carried out by @xmath63 ( with a sufficiently long exposure ) and by the forthcoming @xmath351 , @xmath352 and @xmath353-@xmath26 missions .",
    "important data could be also obtained from observations of the pulsar in the uv range ( @xmath354   ) with the @xmath355 . in particular , such observations would enable one to measure the temperature of the entire ns surface ( cf .",
    "pavlov , stringfellow & crdova 1996a ) and to elucidate other possible heating mechanisms competing with the pc heating .    for more accurate and reliable interpretation of the future observations , more theoretical",
    "work is highly desirable .",
    "in particular , the temperature distribution over the ns surface within and around the pcs should be investigated ( and further used to fit the data ) , and the nonthermal x - ray spectrum and beam shape should be calculated .",
