    "investigations related to the so called complex systems are widely spread among different scientific communities , ranging from physics and biology to economy and psychology .",
    "a considerable part of these works deals with empirical data aiming to extract patterns , regularities or laws that rule the dynamics of the system . in this direction ,",
    "the concept of complexity measures often emerges .",
    "complexity measures can compare empirical data such as time series and classify them in somewhere between regular , chaotic or random  @xcite , while other complexity measures can differentiate between degrees of correlations  @xcite .",
    "examples of these measures include algorithmic complexity  @xcite , entropies  @xcite , relative entropies  @xcite , fractal dimensions  @xcite , and lyapunov exponents  @xcite .",
    "these seminal works are still motivating new definitions , and today there are numerous definitions of complexity , which have been successful applied to different areas such as medicine  @xcite , ecology  @xcite , astrophysics  @xcite , and music  @xcite .    it is surprising that this large number of complexity measures is mainly focused on one - dimensional data , while much less attention has been paid to two and higher - dimensional structures such as images . naturally , there are few exceptions such as the work of grassberger  @xcite and more recent refs .",
    "@xcite , though some of the authors of these papers agree that a higher - dimensional approach still represents an open and subtle problem .",
    "furthermore , as it was stated by bandt and pompe  @xcite , most of the complexity measures depend on specific algorithms or recipes for processing the data which may also depend on tuning parameters . as a direct consequence ,",
    "there are huge difficulties for reproducing previous results without the knowledge of details of the methods .",
    "bandt and pompe not only raised this problem , but they also proposed an alternative method that tries to overcome the previous problems , introducing what they call _ permutation entropy _  a _ natural _ complexity measure for time series .",
    "there are many recent applications of this new technique that confirm its usefulness   @xcite .",
    "in particular , rosso et al .",
    "@xcite have successful applied the bandt and pompe ideas together with a relative entropic measure  @xcite to differentiate chaotic time series from stochastic ones .",
    "they have constructed a diagram , which was first proposed by lpez - ruiz et al .",
    "@xcite , ( called as complexity - entropy causality plane ) by plotting the relative entropic measure versus the permutation entropy .",
    "intriguingly , chaotic and stochastic series are located in different regions of this representation space .    here , we show that the complexity - entropy causality plane can be extended for higher - dimensional patterns .",
    "we apply this new approach in different scenarios related to two - dimensional structures and the results indicate that the method is very promising for distinguishing between two - dimensional patterns .",
    "the following sections are organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to review briefly the properties of the permutation information - theory - derived quantifiers and the complexity - entropy causality plane , and also to define an appropriate way to generalize these definitions to higher - dimensional data . in section iii , we work out several applications based on numerical and empirical data .",
    "section iv presents a summary of our results .",
    "the ingenious idea of bandt and pompe  @xcite was to define a measure that may be easily applied to any type of time series .",
    "the method lies on associating symbolic sequences to the segments of the time series based on the existence of local order , and next , by using probability distribution associated to these symbols , to estimate the complexity quantifier . for purpose of definition ,",
    "let us consider a time series @xmath4 composed by @xmath5 elements and also @xmath6-dimensional vectors ( @xmath7 ) defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "next , for all the @xmath10 vectors , we evaluate the permutations of @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 possible permutations of @xmath14 will be the accessible states of the system , and for each state we estimate the ordinal pattern probability given by @xmath15 where the symbol @xmath16 stands for the number of occurrences of the permutation @xmath14 .",
    "now , we can apply the ordinal patterns probability distribution , @xmath17 , to estimate a complexity measure based on some entropic formulation .    before advancing",
    ", we note that the previous method may be extended to higher - dimensional data structures such as images . in order to do this ,",
    "we consider that the system is now represented by a two - dimensional array @xmath18 of size @xmath19 . in analogy to the vector @xmath20",
    ", we define @xmath21 matrices ( @xmath22 ) given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "next , for all these @xmath26 matrices , we evaluate the permutations @xmath27 @xmath28 $ ] of @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 .",
    "the system can now access @xmath31 states for which we calculate the probability distribution @xmath17 through the relative frequencies given by @xmath32 for easier understanding , we illustrate this procedure for a small array in fig .",
    "[ fig : ext ] .     array ( left panel ) and we choose the embedding dimensions @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the right panel",
    "we illustrate the construction of the states .",
    "we first obtain the sub - matrix corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 that have as elements @xmath37 and , after sorting , this sub - matrix leads to the state `` 0132 '' .",
    "we thus move to next sub - matrix @xmath38 and @xmath36 which have the elements @xmath39 and that , after sorting , leads to the state `` 1023 '' .",
    "the last two remaining matrices lead to the states `` 1230 '' and `` 0132 '' . finally , we estimate the probabilities @xmath40 , that are , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 which are then used in the equations ( [ eq : entropy ] ) and ( [ eq : rosso ] ) , leading to @xmath44 and @xmath45 . ]",
    "naturally , the order procedure that defines the permutation @xmath14 is no longer unique as in the one - dimensional case .",
    "for instance , instead of ordering the elements of @xmath46 row - by - row , we could also order column - by - column .",
    "however , these other definitions will only change the `` name '' of the states in such a way that the set @xmath17 will remain unchanged .",
    "thus , there is no lost of generalization in assuming a given order recipe for defining @xmath14 .",
    "we note that this procedure is straightforward generalized to accomplish higher - dimensional structures ( e.g. , the volumetric brain images obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging ) , and that it recovers the one - dimensional case by setting @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here , for simplicity , we focus our analysis on two - dimensional structures .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( known as embedding dimensions ) play an important role in the estimation of the permutation probability distribution @xmath51 , since they determine the number of accessible states . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "it is usual to choose @xmath52 in order to obtain reliable statistics in the one - dimensional case ( for practical purposes , bandt and pompe recommend @xmath53  @xcite ) .",
    "for the two - dimensional case a similar relationship must hold , i.e. , @xmath54 . to go further ,",
    "we need to rewrite the entropic measures used in refs .",
    "the first one is called normalized permutation entropy  @xcite and it is obtained by applying the shannon s entropy to the probabilities @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath55=\\frac{s[p]}{s_{\\text{max } } } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath56=-\\sum p(\\pi ) \\log p(\\pi)$ ] and @xmath57 $ ] . the value of @xmath58 is obtained by considering all the @xmath59 accessible states to be equiprobable , i.e. , @xmath60 . by definition , @xmath61 \\leq 1 $ ] , where the upper bound occurs for a completely random array .",
    "we expect @xmath62<1 $ ] for arrays that exhibit some kind of correlated dynamics .",
    "the other measure  @xcite is defined by @xmath63=q[p , p_e]\\,h[p]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 $ ] is a relative entropic metric between the empirical ordinal probability @xmath17 and the equiprobable state @xmath65 .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 $ ] is known as disequilibrium and it is defined in terms of the jensen - shannon divergence  @xcite ( or also in terms of a symmetrized kullback - leibler divergence  @xcite ) and can be written as @xmath66 = \\frac{s[(p+p_e)/2 ] - s[p]/2 - s[p_e]/2}{q_{\\text{max}}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 - 2 \\log[2 ( d_x d_y ) ! ] + \\log[(d_x d_y ) ! ] \\right\\}\\,\\ ] ] is the maximum possible value of @xmath64 $ ] , obtained when one of the components of @xmath51 is equal to one and all the other vanish .",
    "the disequilibrium @xmath68 quantifies the degree of correlational structures providing important additional information that may not be carried only by the permutation entropy .",
    "in addition , for a given @xmath62 $ ] value there exists a range of possible values for @xmath69 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "this is the main reason why rosso et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to employ a diagram of @xmath69 $ ] versus @xmath62 $ ] as a diagnostic tool , building up the complexity - entropy causality plane .",
    "in the following , we will calculate the diagram of @xmath69 $ ] versus @xmath62 $ ] to measure the complexity and to distinguish among different two - dimensional patterns .",
    "we generate fractal surfaces through the random midpoint displacement algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm starts with a square . for each vertex",
    ", we assign a random value representing the surface height .",
    "next , we add a new point located at the center of the initial square .",
    "we set the height of this point equal to the average height of the previous four vertex plus a gaussian random number with zero mean and standard - deviation @xmath70 .",
    "we also add four points located at the middle segments which connects each initial vertex .",
    "for these four points , the heights are equal to the average value between the two closest vertex and the middle point plus a gaussian random number with zero mean and standard - deviation @xmath70 .",
    "now , we imagine that these 9 points represent four new squares and , for each one , we apply the previous procedure using @xmath71 . by repeating this process @xmath72 times and using @xmath73",
    ", we should obtain a square surface of side @xmath74 with fractal properties . here",
    ", @xmath75 is the hurst exponent and @xmath76 is the surface fractal dimension .",
    "figure [ fig : midpoint ] shows several surfaces generated through this procedure for different values of @xmath75 .",
    "surfaces ( @xmath77 ) for different values of the hurst exponent @xmath75 . for easier visualization",
    ", we have scaled the height of the surfaces in order to stay between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we note that for small values of @xmath75 the surfaces display an alternation of peaks and valleys ( anti - persistent behavior ) much more frequent than those one obtained for larger values of @xmath75 . for larger values of @xmath75 ,",
    "the surfaces are smoother reflecting the persistent behavior induced by the value of @xmath80 . ]",
    "we apply our method for these surfaces aiming to verify how the permutation quantifiers @xmath81 and @xmath68 change with the hurst exponent @xmath75 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : midpointa ] . in these 3d plots ,",
    "we show the localization in the causality plane obtained for different values of @xmath75 evaluated from @xmath82 surfaces ( @xmath83 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : midpointa]a , we use @xmath33 and @xmath84 ( circles ) , and @xmath85 and @xmath34 ( squares ) as embedding dimensions . note that the values of @xmath81 and @xmath68 are practically invariant under the rotation @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this invariance is related to the fact that in these fractal surfaces there is not preferential direction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : midpointa]b , we employ @xmath85 and @xmath84 .",
    "we note basically the same dependence but a different range for @xmath81 and @xmath68 , since this change increases the number of accessible states .",
    "these results show that our method properly differentiates fractal surfaces concerning the hurst exponent .",
    "moreover , we investigate the robustness of the permutation quantifiers under several realizations of the random midpoint displacement algorithm and the results show that both indexes are very stable .",
    "for example , the standard - deviation in the values of @xmath81 and @xmath68 are usually smaller than @xmath88 when considering @xmath83 .    .",
    "* we have employed fractal surfaces of size @xmath89 ( @xmath83 ) . in ( a ) we plot @xmath68 and @xmath81 versus @xmath75 for the embedding dimensions @xmath33 and @xmath84 ( circles ) and also for @xmath85 and @xmath34 ( squares ) .",
    "we note the invariance of the index against the rotation @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in ( b )",
    "we plot the diagram for @xmath90 .",
    "we observe changes in the scale of @xmath68 and @xmath81 caused by the increasing number of states . in both cases , as @xmath75 increases the complexity @xmath68 also increases while the permutation entropy @xmath81 decreases .",
    "this behavior reflects the differences in the roughness shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : midpoint ] . for values of @xmath91",
    "the surface is anti - persistent which generates a flatter distribution for the values of @xmath17 leading to values of @xmath68 and @xmath81 closer to the aleatory limit ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) . for values of @xmath80",
    "there is a persistent behavior in the surfaces heights which generates a more intricate distribution of @xmath17 and , consequently , values of @xmath81 and @xmath68 that are closer to the middle of the causality plane ( region of higher complexity ) . ]",
    "another interesting application is related to different patterns that a thin film of a liquid crystal exhibits .",
    "these textures are obtained by observing a thin sample of liquid crystal placed between two crossed polarizers in a microscope .",
    "the textures give useful information about the macroscopic structure of the liquid crystal .",
    "for instance , different phases have different typical textures , and by tracking their evolution one can properly identify the phase transition .",
    "we first study a lyotropic liquid crystal under isotropic - nematic - isotropic phase transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : lio ] shows three snapshots of the texture at different temperatures . in this case , we clearly note the differences in the textures .",
    "the leftmost and rightmost textures are at the isotropic phase while the middle one is at the nematic phase .",

    "the different shaded areas represent the different liquid crystal phases .",
    "note that the phase transitions are properly identified in all cases .",
    "due to the asymmetry of the elongated capillary tube where the liquid crystal sample is placed , @xmath81 and @xmath68 present slight differences under the rotation @xmath86 and @xmath87 . ]",

    ", there is a surface effect that act on the liquid crystal molecules .",
    "this effect is usually amplified at the phase transition and it is also the reason for differences between the embedding dimensions .    in this particular phase transition ,",
    "the difference between the textures are large enough that it can be identified just by visual inspection .",
    "however , this is not the usual case and many phase transitions are very difficult to identify . in this context",
    ", an interesting question is whether our method can help to distinguish different phases . to address this question ,",
    "we evaluate @xmath81 and @xmath68 for twelve characteristic textures of different liquid crystals .",
    "we download these textures from the webpage of the liquid crystal institute at kent state university  @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : lc - textures ] shows the value of @xmath81 and @xmath68 for each texture in the causality plane .",
    "the results allow to conclude that the method ranks the textures in a kind of complexity order where each characteristic texture occupies a different place in this representation space .",
    "moreover , the different values of @xmath81 and @xmath68 indicate that the permutation quantifiers can also identify smooth phase transitions .",
    "naturally , the location of each texture in the causality plane should be related to physical properties of the liquid crystals",
    ". a better understanding of the relation between the permutation quantifiers and these physical attributes may deserves a more careful investigation since some properties of liquid crystals such as the order parameter can be quite hard to empirically measure . in this context , the existence of a clear relation between , for example , the order parameter and @xmath81 or @xmath68 will be experimentally handy . here",
    ", we just have the pictures of the textures in such a way that is very hard to point out these relationships . however , a visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc - textures ] suggests that some of the more ordered phases , such as the blue phase ( this phase display a cubic structure of defects ) , are located in the central part of the causality plane ( region of higher complexity ) , while other textures which present a large number of non - ordered defects , such as the smectic b and c , are positioned closer to the aleatory limit ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "thus , it seems that the permutation quantifiers are capturing in somehow the competition between the orientational order of the phase and , also , the number of defects present in the textures .     and @xmath84 .",
    "the image sizes are about @xmath98 pixels .",
    "we note that each texture has a unique position in the causality plane which indicates that the permutation quantifiers are capable of differentiate not only transitions involving the isotropic phase , but also smoother phase transitions .",
    "we further observe that some high ordered phase such as the blue phase are located at the central part of the causality plane ( region of higher complexity ) , while other phases which present a large number of defects such as the smectic b and c are closer to the aleatory limit ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) . ]      as a last application , we study the permutation measures @xmath81 and @xmath68 applied to ising surfaces  @xcite .",
    "these surfaces are obtained by accumulating the lattice spin values @xmath99 of the ising model defined by the hamiltonian @xmath100 where the sum is over all the pairs of first neighbor sites in the lattice .",
    "we numerically solve this spin-@xmath101 ising model on a @xmath102 lattice using the monte carlo method with periodic boundary conditions . by using the spin values",
    ", we define the surface height for each lattice site @xmath103 as @xmath104 where @xmath105 represents the number of monte carlo steps . in fig .  [",
    "fig : isingsurf ] , we show three surfaces obtained though this procedure for different values of the reduced temperature @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the critical temperature of the model .",
    "we note the complex pattern exhibited by the surface for @xmath108 , and the almost random patterns for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    ". moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : isingsurftemp]c presents a 3d visualization of the phase transition for @xmath90 .",
    "this higher - dimensional representation can be useful when investigating more complex phase transitions , since a greater number of degrees of freedom allows the critical point to be more visible .",
    "we further study the temporal evolution of @xmath81 and @xmath68 for different reduced temperatures , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isingsurfttime ] .",

    "<S> complexity measures are essential to understand complex systems and there are numerous definitions to analyze one - dimensional data . however , extensions of these approaches to two or higher - dimensional data , such as images , are much less common . here , we reduce this gap by applying the ideas of the permutation entropy combined with a relative entropic index . </S>",
    "<S> we build up a numerical procedure that can be easily implemented to evaluate the complexity of two or higher - dimensional patterns . </S>",
    "<S> we work out this method in different scenarios where numerical experiments and empirical data were taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we have applied the method to @xmath0 fractal landscapes generated numerically where we compare our measures with the hurst exponent ; @xmath1 liquid crystal textures where nematic - isotropic - nematic phase transitions were properly identified ; @xmath2 12 characteristic textures of liquid crystals where the different values show that the method can distinguish different phases ; @xmath3 and ising surfaces where our method identified the critical temperature and also proved to be stable . </S>"
