    "in many branches of theoretical physics one encounters the necessity to reconstruct an observable from a diverging perturbation series .",
    "this is possible because a divergent series , by itself , is not a bad thing , but still carries profound mathematical meaning  @xcite .",
    "take , for example , the geometric series @xmath1 where the sum on the right - hand side ( r.h.s . )",
    "converges only for @xmath2 . nonetheless , if one regards the left - hand side ( l.h.s . ) as a definition of the formal sum , as already done by euler  @xcite , that sum obtains a well - defined meaning even for @xmath3 , giving , for instance , @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , quantum - mechanical perturbation theory may yield a formal series @xmath5 for some quantity @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a small parameter .",
    "the coefficients @xmath8 may be such that the series is asymptotic , having zero radius of convergence , as it happens , e.g. , when computing the ground - state energy of an anharmonic oscillator with a quartic perturbation of a quadratic potential  @xcite .",
    "the task then again is to identify the unknown true observable on the l.h.s .  from the given formal sum on the r.h.s .",
    "the concept that naturally comes into play here is analytic continuation .",
    "still , for applying this concept in practice , when merely a few leading coefficients @xmath8 are available , one needs to invoke some sort of _ a priori _ hypothesis about @xmath6 , either explicitly or implicitly .",
    "for instance , if one possesses explicit knowledge of @xmath6 for large values of @xmath7 , one can exploit this for designing rapidly converging strong - coupling expansions from divergent weak - coupling perturbation series  @xcite .",
    "when resorting instead to the more familiar pad approximation technique  @xcite , one introduces rational approximants of the form @xmath9 and equates the coefficients obtained from a taylor series expansion of @xmath10 up to the order @xmath11 to those of the perturbation series  ( [ eq : pes ] ) . while the resulting pad table then may yield good numerical values of the desired quantity , one is implictly imposing the asymptotic behavior @xmath12 for large @xmath7 , which may not be physically correct .    recently",
    ", mera , pedersen , and nikoli  @xcite have suggested to replace the rational pad approximants  ( [ eq : rpa ] ) by hypergeometric functions , which represent another form of an implicit _ a priori _ hypothesis .",
    "the examples from elementary single - particle quantum mechanics studied by these authors suggest that the corresponding analytic continuation technique can dramatically outperform pad and borel - pad approaches .",
    "hence , it was conjectured that the hypergeometric - function scheme might also be useful for many - body problems of condensed - matter physics@xcite .    in the present letter",
    "we provide first evidence which strongly supports this conjecture .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - hubbard model on a square lattice , which constitutes a system of paradigmatic importance for quantum many - body theory  @xcite , and develop a `` hypergeometric '' technique for obtaining the critical exponents of its mott insulator - to - superfluid transition .",
    "we proceed as follows : we first briefly introduce the bose - hubbard model , and the strong - coupling perturbation series derived from it , which serves as input for the subsequent analysis .",
    "next , we show how gaussian hypergeometric functions @xmath13 , and their generalizations @xmath14 , emerge quite naturally when studying the quantum phase transition .",
    "we then apply our scheme for computing the phase diagram and the critical exponent of the order parameter .",
    "this is of some conceptual interest , since these exponents are supposed to be universal , but there is still a slight discrepancy  @xcite between experimentally measured  @xcite and theoretically calculated  @xcite values .",
    "our scheme opens up a fresh approach to this subtle issue .",
    "we consider the pure bose - hubbard model for interacting bose particles  @xcite on a two - dimensional square lattice at zero temperature . in its grand - canonical version this model",
    "is characterized by three parameters : the hopping matrix element  @xmath15 , which quantifies the strength of the tunneling contact between neighboring lattice sites , the repulsion energy  @xmath16 provided by each pair of particles occupying the same lattice site , and the chemical potential  @xmath17 . for a given value of @xmath17 the competition between particle delocalization due to tunneling and",
    "localization caused by repulsion leads to the well - known quantum phase transition from a mott insulator to a superfluid when the ratio @xmath18 is gradually increased , starting from zero  @xcite .",
    "we employ the fock - space operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 which create or annihilate a boson at the @xmath21th site , so that @xmath22 counts the number of particles at that site , and use @xmath16 as the energy scale of reference .",
    "the non - dimensionalized hamiltonian then is written as @xmath23 where the site - diagonal part @xmath24 models the on - site repulsion and incorporates the chemical potential to fix the particle number ; this operator  ( [ eq : hdi ] ) serves as the starting point for perturbative expansions  @xcite .",
    "the further term @xmath25 accounts for the tunneling effect , with the sum ranging over all pairs of neighboring sites @xmath21 and @xmath26 . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we then break the particle - number conservation implied by this bose - hubbard model  ( [ eq : hbh ] ) by adding spatially uniform sources and drains , @xmath27 where , without loss of generality , we have taken the dimensionless source strength  @xmath28 to be real .",
    "the quantity of interest now is the intensive ground - state energy @xmath29 where the expectation value is taken with respect to the ground state of the extended model  ( [ eq : ebh ] ) , and @xmath30 denotes the number of sites , assumed to be so large that finite - size effects do not matter . from this",
    "we obtain the susceptibility @xmath31 where the first identity constitutes the definition of @xmath32 , and the second is provided by the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "when taken at @xmath33 , this derivative describes the response of the original bose - hubbard model  ( [ eq : hbh ] ) to the sources and drains : the expectation value @xmath34 is zero in the mott - insulating phase , but takes on nonzero values in the superfluid phase , and thus serves as order parameter .",
    "assuming now that the ground - state energy per site can be expanded in a power series of @xmath28 , we write @xmath35 for each @xmath36 the coefficients @xmath37 , known as @xmath38-particle correlation functions , are then expanded in powers of @xmath39 : @xmath40 in order to make contact with the landau theory of phase transitions  @xcite , the key idea now is to employ @xmath32 instead of @xmath28 as independent variable .",
    "this is achieved by means of a legendre transformation , which leads to the effective potential  @xcite @xmath41 with the one - particle - irreducible vertices @xmath42 having suppressed their dependence on @xmath18 and @xmath43 . since @xmath28 and @xmath32 constitute a legendre - conjugated pair , this construction implies @xmath44 leading to the physical interpretation of the formalism : since the actual bose - hubbard system  ( [ eq : hbh ] ) is recovered by setting @xmath33 , the physical solutions correspond to the stable stationary points of @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "now one can invoke a standard argument : assuming @xmath46 and @xmath47 to be positive , and neglecting higher order terms of the expansion  ( [ eq : gam ] ) , a single minimum of @xmath45 is found at @xmath48 as long as @xmath49 , indicating the mott insulator phase .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath50 the minimum is found at @xmath51 , thus signaling the presence of the superfluid phase .",
    "therefore , for given chemical potential @xmath43 the transition occurs when @xmath52 , that is , at that value @xmath53 at which the series @xmath54 starts to diverge  @xcite .",
    "moreover , from the usual landau form @xmath55 one obtains @xmath56 for @xmath57 . assuming @xmath46 to be positive and smooth at the transition , the exponent  @xmath58 which characterizes the emergence of the order parameter according to @xmath59^{2\\beta } \\label{eq : dce}\\ ] ] is thus solely determined by @xmath60 .",
    "this sets the stage for the present work : its starting point is the perturbation series  ( [ eq : psc ] ) for the coefficient @xmath61 .",
    "although this series requires a small parameter @xmath18 it is referred to as a strong - coupling expansion  @xcite , since it should converge in the strongly correlated mott regime .",
    "we have evaluated its coefficients @xmath62 numerically up to the order @xmath63 in @xmath18  @xcite , making use of the process - chain approach as devised in general form by eckardt  @xcite .",
    "this technique , which has been recognized as an extremely powerful method  @xcite , is based on kato s non - recursive formulation of the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series  @xcite . here",
    "we take these coefficients as input for determining optimal hypergeometric approximants to the landau parameter @xmath64 , as detailed in the following section , from which the respective exponents @xmath58 can then be read off directly .",
    "given the coefficients @xmath65 for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , ",
    ", @xmath69 , the first task is to deduce the radius of convergence of the series  ( [ eq : psc ] ) .",
    "this can be accomplished only if some _ a priori _ knowledge concerning the unknown higher - order coefficients is invested . to this end",
    ", useful guidance is provided by the case of high dimensionality  @xmath70 : as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath71 the expansion  ( [ eq : psc ] ) becomes a geometric series , @xmath72 from which one can immediately read off its radius of convergence @xmath73 after working out @xmath74 , this leads precisely to the mean - field phase boundary  @xcite @xmath75 where the integer filling factor  @xmath76 satisfies @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , in this limiting case the landau coefficient @xmath60 takes the simple form @xmath78 exhibiting the mean - field exponent @xmath79 .     of subsequent coefficients of the series  ( [ eq : psc ] ) for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as corresponding to the tip of the lowest mott lobe shown in fig .",
    "the solid horizontal line indicates the limit @xmath82 expected from qmc calculations  @xcite .",
    "observe that all coefficients @xmath62 have the same sign , which impedes the borel summability of the series  ( [ eq : psc]).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    for finite dimension  @xmath70 , however , the ratio @xmath83 of subsequent coefficients is not constant . for @xmath80",
    "this is shown exemplarily in fig .",
    "[ f_1 ] for @xmath84 , corresponding to the tip of the lowest mott lobe of the phase diagram depicted later in fig .",
    "thus , the corresponding series  ( [ eq : psc ] ) is no longer geometric , so that it is tempting to _ assume _ a landau coefficient of the form @xmath85 thereby admitting nontrivial exponents @xmath86 . according to this educated guess",
    ", the expansion  ( [ eq : psc ] ) should have the form of a binomial series , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the usual pochhammer symbol  @xcite . from an optimal fit of the given coefficients  @xmath62 to this hypothesis",
    "one could then determine approximate values of the two parameters @xmath86 and @xmath53 .    but",
    "this guess can still be improved : realizing that the binomial series coincides with the function @xmath89 , employing the nomenclature used for generalized hypergeometric functions  @xcite , one may generalize the _ a priori _",
    "ansatz  ( [ eq : apa ] ) further and require @xmath90 where now @xmath91 denotes the well - known gaussian hypergeometric function  @xcite , giving us four degrees of freedom for a least - square fit to the @xmath69 perturbative data .",
    "the strength of its singularity at the point of divergence is given by @xmath92 from which one finds the exponents @xmath93 going still one step further , one may replace @xmath13 by a generalized hypergeometric function @xmath94 providing @xmath95 degrees of freedom , requiring the evaluation of the perturbation series at least to the corresponding order .",
    "this possibility to perform analytic continuation of a perturbation series by means of an analytic function which itself is a member of a general familiy of `` higher order '' functions is the core of the proposal made in ref .",
    "the hypergeometric functions , just as the binomial series , can adopt complex values beyond their radius of convergence . in view of its physical meaning",
    "we require @xmath61 , as well as @xmath64 , to be a real quantity , so that we take the real part of @xmath96 .",
    "technically , this is achieved by computing @xmath97 .",
    "thus , from the expectation of a nontrivial exponent we infer that @xmath61 has to have an essential singularity at @xmath53 with a strength determining the respective exponent .",
    "this is why @xmath94 are suitable approximants : as exemplified by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sin ] ) , the strength of their singularities can be tuned by adjusting their parameters .",
    "we have applied this strategy to the series  ( [ eq : psc ] ) for the two - dimensional bose - hubbard model with @xmath98 , having at disposal its coefficients @xmath62 up to @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f_2 ] again displays the ratios @xmath83 of subsequent coefficients for @xmath100 , now plotted vs.  the reciprocal order @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , we also indicate by continuous lines the ratios resulting from the best fit @xmath102 to the binomial series hypothesis  ( [ eq : apa ] ) , and from the best fit @xmath103 to the gaussian hypergeometric hypothesis  ( [ eq : apb ] ) . evidently , the quality of these fits is excellent .",
    "this allows us to perform reliable extrapolations to @xmath104 , where the ratios should approach the expected value @xmath82 known from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have also fitted the exact coefficients to those of generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ".     of subsequent coefficients of the series  ( [ eq : psc ] ) for @xmath80 and @xmath84 , plotted vs.  the reciprocal order @xmath101 , together with the corresponding ratios obtained from the fit  ( [ eq : fbs ] ) to the binomial series , and from the fit  ( [ eq : fgh ] ) to the gaussian hypergeometric function .",
    "again , the horizontal line indicates the limit @xmath82 expected from qmc calculations  @xcite.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    performing these procedures for all values of the chemical potential that are of interest , and reading off the respective values of @xmath53 , we obtain the system s phase diagram . in fig .",
    "[ f_3 ] we show this diagram for @xmath107 , as resulting from the binomial and from the gaussian hypergeometric fit , respectively .",
    "the relative deviation between both curves stays below 4% .",
    "it is largest halfway between the position of a tip of a mott lobe and the nearest integer values of @xmath43 ; at the tips these deviations are smaller than  @xmath108 .",
    "particles per site , outside these lobes in a superfluid state . also shown",
    "is the expression for the lowest mott lobe stated in ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the tips of the mott lobes represent multicritical points with particle - hole symmetry ; here the system falls into the universality class of the @xmath109-dimensional @xmath0  model  @xcite .",
    "the critical scaled hopping strength  @xmath53 at the tip of the lowest lobe for @xmath80 , as provided by the respective fit , figures as @xmath110 which matches the qmc value @xmath111 quite well .",
    "if we assume this value to be exact , and take the result provided by @xmath13 as sound compromise between the number of coefficients available and the number of fit parameters , the error of that result is less than @xmath108 .     for @xmath84 , as obtained by gaussian hypergeometric continuation ; for @xmath57 the real part is shown . also shown is the power - law fit  ( [ eq : fit]).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    so far , we have used hypergeometric continuation merely to reproduce existing knowledge , thus confirming its reliability . however , with the determinantion of the order parameter s exponent we now move to a ground which is technically far more demanding  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f_4 ] we show the gaussian hypergeometric description of the landau coefficient @xmath64 , and its analytic continuation beyond the transition point , again at the tip of the lowest mott lobe .",
    "the data are well described by the power - law fit @xmath112     of the order parameter @xmath32 for the mott insulator - to - superfluid transition , as obtained by binomial and gaussian hypergeometric continuation , respectively .",
    "the `` critical '' value @xmath113 is adopted at the tips of the mott lobes.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    performing this procedure within the interval @xmath114 for both the binomial and the gaussian hypergeometric ansatz , we obtain the exponents displayed in fig .",
    "[ f_5 ] . while both variants lead to notably different results for general @xmath43 , they agree quite well at the tip of the lobes , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the critical points .",
    "this observation is quite significant , since one expects nontrivial critical exponents only at the tips of the lobes , while the system should be mean - field like for all other @xmath36 .",
    "our approximate scheme can only yield continuous lines , and it is an open question whether these would reduce to @xmath115-like spikes with higher orders .",
    "however , the relative stability of the data at the lobes tips indicates that one can actually determine the true critical exponent @xmath116 of the mott insulator - to - superfluid transition with good accuracy by hypergeometric continuation . in particular , at the tip of the lowest lobe",
    "we obtain the following values : @xmath117 this gives rise to a nontrivial test of the universality hypothesis for critical phenomena . using the scaling relation @xmath118 , and inserting the best known estimates for the critical exponents @xmath119 and @xmath120 , as derived from the three - dimensional @xmath0 model by combining monte carlo simulations based on finite - size scaling methods and high - temperature expansions  @xcite , the assumption of universality yields the expectation @xmath121 .",
    "indeed , this coincides within less than 1% with our @xmath13-estimate extracted from the 2d bose - hubbard model .",
    "it remains to be seen whether further refinement of our approach will result in an even better confirmation of the universality hypothesis .",
    "in summary , we haven taken up an idea put forward by mera , pedersen , and nikoli , who have suggested to utilize hypergeometric functions for the analytic continuation of divergent perturbation series  @xcite ; here we have adapted this concept to the strong - coupling perturbation series  ( [ eq : psc ] ) of the bose - hubbard model . after evaluating this series to the maximum accessible order in the scaled hopping strength  @xmath18 , which is @xmath63 in the present case , we are in a position to determine the parameters of its hypergeometic approximants from a least - square fit with high accuracy .",
    "this has enabled us to assess the critical exponent of the order parameter of the mott insulator - to - superfluid transition .",
    "compared to a previous attempt to deduce critical exponents from diverging perturbation series  @xcite , the present approach is conceptually simpler , and more easy to handle in practice .",
    "the success of this approach indicates that hypergeometric functions , and their generalizations , indeed embody the proper _ a priori _ knowledge required by this quantum phase transition . aside from further refinements ,",
    "the next steps to be taken with hypergeometric analytic continuation will involve the investigation of the superfluid density , and the corresponding analysis of the 3d  bose - hubbard model .",
    "one of us ( m.h . ) wishes to thank d.  hinrichs and a.  pelster for long discussions .",
    "the computations were performed on the hpc cluster hero , located at the university of oldenburg and funded by the dfg through its major research instrumentation programme ( inst 184/108 - 1 fugg ) , and by the ministry of science and culture ( mwk ) of the lower saxony state ."
