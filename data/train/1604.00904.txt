    "this model has a clear lhc signature : neutralino production via vector boson fusion.@xcite all this can be realised in string models with sequestered susy breaking.@xcite      a generic feature of string compactifications is the presence of light axionic degrees of freedom which is unavoidable in string models where not all the moduli are fixed by non - perturbative effect .",
    "@xcite this leads to the production of axionic dark radiation from the decay of the lightest modulus .",
    "@xcite in fact , the moduli are gauge singlets , and so they do not prefer to decay into visible sector fields and might have non - negligible branching ratios into light axions .",
    "this results in a non - zero contribution to the effective number of neutrino - like species @xmath223 which parameterises the energy density of radiation as : _",
    "rad = _ ( 1 + ( ) ^4/3 n_eff ) however there are tight bounds from observations , @xmath224 at @xmath225 @xmath226,@xcite which would give a central value of order @xmath227 .",

    "thus when @xmath179 decays , it produces both sm particles and axionic dark radiation .",
    "these axions are relativistic , and so behave as radiation even if they are not in thermal equilibrium with sm particles since they are very weakly ( gravitationally ) coupled .",
    "hence they free - stream to present day .",
    "given that the temperature of the thermal bath is @xmath231 while the energy of the axions is @xmath232 , the ratio between the two energies is:@xcite ~~10 ^ 6()^1/2 this ratio is retained through all cosmic history .",
    "therefore , if the lightest modulus mass is around @xmath233 gev ( often associated with low - energy susy in many string models ) , for @xmath234 ev these axions today have an energy of order @xmath235 ev .",
    "hence we have the prediction of a cosmic axion background ( cab ) with energies in the soft x - ray wavebands.@xcite let us stress that this prediction comes from very general properties of string moduli since it relies just on the existence of massive particles with only gravitational couplings to ordinary matter .",
    "this cab can be revealed via axion - photon conversion in coherent magnetic fields induced by a lagrangian of the form : = -14 f^f _ + 12 _ a ^a -12 m_a^2 a^2 - f^ _ notice that @xmath236 gev from supernovae cooling bounds .",

    "inconsistent morphology of the signal : one would expect a non - zero signal from everywhere in the dark matter halo but the signal is stronger from the central cool core of perseus,@xcite and ophiucus and centaurus.@xcite 3 .",
    "non - observation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies : dwarf galaxies are dominated by dark matter , and so they should give the cleanest dark matter decay line but no line has been observed from these astrophysical objects .",
    "an alternative explanation of the @xmath9 kev line relies on a monochromatic @xmath9 kev axion line produced from the decay of a dark matter particle with @xmath258 kev , followed by axion - photon conversion in the cluster magnetic field.@xcite the dark matter decay into axions could be induced by couplings of the form : _ a ^a_= |^^5 _ a= the predicted photon flux is:@xcite",
    "f_dm^i_dma p_a^i _ dm^i ( ) ^2 it is interesting to notice that observational data can be matched for the same values which reproduce the soft x - ray excess : @xmath253 ev and @xmath254 gev .",
    "moreover this line with a @xmath45-dependent strength can explain all the anomalies listed above :    1 .",
    "since the photon flux depends on both dark matter density and @xmath45-field , a stronger signal from perseus is explained by its large magnetic field 2 .",
    "the morphology of the signal is explained by the fact that the @xmath45-field peakes at the central cool core in galaxy clusters 3 .",
