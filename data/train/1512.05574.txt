    "]    genetic differences between individuals are responsible for variation in the observable phenotypes .",
    "this principle underpins genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) , which map the genetic architecture of complex traits by measuring genetic variation at single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) on a genome - wide scale across many individuals @xcite .",
    "gwas have resulted in major improvements in plant and animal breeding @xcite and in numerous insights into the genetic basis of complex diseases in human @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative trait loci ( qtls ) with large effects are uncommon and a molecular explanation for their trait association rarely exists @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of qtls indeed lie in non - coding genomic regions and presumably play a gene regulatory role @xcite .",
    "consequently , numerous studies have identified _ cis_- and _ trans_-acting dna variants that influence gene expression levels ( i.e. , `` expression qtls '' ; eqtls ) in model organisms , plants , farm animals and human ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "gene expression programmes are of course highly tissue- and cell - type specific , and the properties and complex relations of eqtl associations across multiple tissues are only beginning to be mapped @xcite . at the molecular level ,",
    "a mounting body of evidence shows that _ cis_-eqtls primarily cause variation in transcription factor ( tf ) binding to gene regulatory dna elements , which then causes changes in histone modifications , dna methylation and mrna expression of nearby genes ; _",
    "trans_-eqtls in turn can usually be attributed to coding variants in regulatory genes or _",
    "cis_-eqtls of such genes @xcite .    taken together ,",
    "these results motivate and justify a systems biological view of quantitative genetics ( `` systems genetics '' ) , where it is hypothesized that genetic variation , together with environmental perturbations , affects the status of molecular networks of interacting genes , proteins and metabolites ; these networks act within and across different tissues and collectively control physiological phenotypes @xcite . studying the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation networks is of crucial importance in understanding the fundamental biological mechanisms by which genetic variation causes variation in phenotypes @xcite , and is expected to lead to the discovery of novel disease biomarkers and drug targets in human and veterinary medicine @xcite . since direct experimental mapping of genetic , protein  protein or protein  dna interactions is an immensely challenging task , further exacerbated by the cell - type specific and dynamic nature of these interactions @xcite , comprehensive , experimentally verified molecular networks will not become available for multi - cellular organisms in the foreseeable future .",
    "statistical and computational methods are therefore essential to reconstruct trait - associated causal networks by integrating diverse omics data @xcite .",
    "a typical systems genetics study collects genotype and gene , protein and/or metabolite expression data from a large number of individuals segregating for one or more traits of interest .",
    "after raw data processing and normalization , eqtls are identified for each of the expression data types , and a co - expression matrix is constructed .",
    "causal bayesian gene networks , co - expression modules ( i.e. clusters ) and/or causal bayesian module networks are then reconstructed . _ in silico _ validation of predicted networks and modules using independent data confirms their overall validity , ideally followed by experimental validation of the most promising findings in a relevant cell line or model organism ( figure [ fig - flow ] ) .",
    "here we review the main analytic principles behind each of the steps from eqtl identification to _ in silico _ network validation , and present a selection of most commonly used methods and softwares for each step . throughout this chapter ,",
    "we tacitly assume that all data has been quality controlled , pre - processed and normalized to suit the assumptions of the analytic methods presented here . for expression data , this usually means working with log - transformed data where each gene expression profile is centred around zero with standard deviation one .",
    "we also assume that the data has been corrected for any confounding factors , either by regressing out known covariates and/or by estimating hidden factors @xcite .",
    "a first step towards identifying molecular networks affected by dna variants is to identify variants that underpin variations in eqtls of transcripts @xcite , proteins @xcite or metabolites @xcite across individuals .",
    "when studying a single trait , as in gwas , it is possible to consider multiple statistical models to explicitly account for additive and/or dominant genetic effects @xcite .",
    "however , when the possible effects of a million or more snps on tens of thousands of molecular abundance traits need to be tested , as is common in modern genetics of gene expression studies , the computational cost of testing snp - trait associations one - by - one becomes prohibitive . to address this problem ,",
    "new methods have been developed to calculate the test statistics for the parametric linear regression and analysis of variance ( anova ) models @xcite and the non - parametric anova model ( or kruskal - wallis test ) @xcite using fast matrix multiplication algorithms , implemented in the softwares * matrix - eqtl * ( http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/matrix_eqtl/ ) @xcite and * krux * ( https://github.com/tmichoel/krux ) @xcite .    in both softwares , genotype values of @xmath2 genetic markers and expression levels of @xmath3 transcripts , proteins or metabolites in @xmath4 individuals",
    "are organized in an @xmath5 genotype matrix @xmath6 and @xmath7 expression data matrix @xmath8 .",
    "genetic markers take values @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the maximum number of alleles ( @xmath11 for biallelic markers ) , while molecular traits take continuous values . in the linear model",
    ", a linear relation is tested between the expression level of gene @xmath12 and the genotype value ( i.e.  the number of reference alleles ) of snp @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding test statistic is the pearson correlation between the @xmath12th row of @xmath8 and the @xmath13th row of @xmath6 , for all values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . standardising the data matrices to zero mean and unit variance , such that for all @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14",
    "it follows that the correlation values can be computed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the transpose of @xmath6 .",
    "hence , a single matrix multiplication suffices to compute the test statistics for the linear model for all pairs of traits and snps .",
    "the anova models test if expression levels in different genotype groups originate from the same distribution .",
    "therefore , anova models can account for both additive and dominant effects of a genetic variant on expression levels . in the parametric anova model ,",
    "suppose the test samples are divided into @xmath17 groups by the snp @xmath13 . the mean expression level for gene @xmath12 in each group",
    "@xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of samples in genotype group @xmath18 for snp @xmath13 .    again assuming that the expression data is standardised , the f - test statistic for testing gene @xmath12 against snp @xmath13 can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sum of squares between groups , @xmath23    let us define the @xmath24 indicator matrix @xmath25 for genotype group @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "then @xmath29 hence , for each pair of expression level @xmath30 and snp @xmath31 , the sum of squares matrix @xmath22 can be computed via @xmath32 matrix multiplications .",
    "matrix multiplications , because the data standardization implies that @xmath33 . ]    in the non - parametric anova model , the expression data matrix is converted to a matrix @xmath34 of data ranks , independently over each row . in the absence of ties ,",
    "the kruskal - wallis test statistic is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the average expression rank of gene @xmath12 in genotype group @xmath18 of snp @xmath13 , defined as @xmath37 which can be similarly obtained from the @xmath32 matrix multiplications .",
    "there is as yet no consensus about which statistical model is most appropriate for eqtl detection .",
    "non - parametric methods were introduced in the earliest eqtl studies @xcite and have remained popular , as they are robust against variations in the underlying genetic model and trait distribution .",
    "more recently , the linear model implemented in matrix - eqtl has been used in a number of large - scale studies @xcite .",
    "a comparison on a dataset of 102 human whole blood samples showed that the parametric anova method was highly sensitive to the presence of outlying gene expression values and snps with singleton genotype group .",
    "linear models reported the highest number of eqtl associations after empirical false discovery rate ( fdr ) correction , with an expected bias towards additive linear associations .",
    "the kruskal - wallis test was most robust against data outliers and heterogeneous genotype group sizes and detected a higher proportion of non - linear associations , but was more conservative for calling additive linear associations than linear models @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "when large numbers of traits and markers have to be tested for association , efficient matrix multiplication methods can be employed to calculate all test statistics at once , leading to a dramatic reduction in computation time compared to calculating these statistics one - by - one for every pair using traditional methods .",
    "matrix multiplication is a basic mathematical operation which has been purposely studied and optimized for tens of years @xcite .",
    "highly efficient packages , such as * blas * ( http://www.netlib.org/blas/ ) and * lapack * ( http://www.netlib.org/lapack/ ) , are available for use on generic cpus , and are indeed employed in most mainstream scientific computing softwares and programming languages , such as matlab and r. in recent years , graphics processor unit ( gpu)-accelerated computing , such as cuda , has revolutionised scientific calculations that involve repetitive operations in parallel on bulky data , offering even more speedup than the existing cpu - based packages .",
    "the first applications of gpu computing in eqtl analysis have already appeared ( e.g. @xcite ) , and more can be expected in the future .",
    "lastly , for pairs exceeding a pre - defined threshold on the test statistic , a @xmath38-value can be computed from the corresponding test distribution , and these @xmath38-values can then be further corrected for multiple testing by common procedures @xcite .",
    "the pearson correlation is the simplest and computationally most efficient similarity measure for gene expression profiles . for genes @xmath12 and @xmath13 , their pearson correlation can be written as @xmath39 in matrix notation ,",
    "this can be combined as the matrix multiplication @xmath40    gene pairs with large positive or negative correlation values tend to be up- or down - regulated together , due to either a direct regulatory link between them , or being jointly co - regulated by a third , often hidden , factor . by filtering for correlation values exceeding a significance threshold determined by comparison with randomly permuted data ,",
    "a discrete co - expression network is obtained . assuming that a high degree of co - expression signifies that genes are involved in the same biological processes , graph theoretical methods can be employed , for instance , to predict gene function @xcite .",
    "one drawback of the pearson correlation is that by definition it is biased towards _ linear _ associations . to overcome this limitation , other measures are available .",
    "the spearman correlation uses expression data ranks ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : genet - gene - expr ] ) in equation , and will give high score to _ monotonic _ relations .",
    "mutual information is the most general measure and detects both linear and non - linear associations . for a pair of discrete random variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( representing the expression levels of two genes ) taking values @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ,",
    "the mutual information is defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the individual and joint shannon entropies of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and @xmath47 , and likewise for the other terms . since",

    "to illustrate the above concepts , we show some results for a co - expression cluster in visceral fat ( 88 samples , 324 genes ) which was highly enriched for tissue development genes ( @xmath118 ) and contained 10 genome - wide significant eqtl genes and 25 transcription factors , including eight members of the homeobox family ( figure [ fig - figs]a ) .     for further details.[fig - figs ] ]    a representative example of an inferred causal interaction is given by the co - expression interaction between hap1 ( huntingtin - associated protein 1 , chr17 q21.2 - 21.3 ) and foxg1 ( forkhead box g1 , chr14",

    "in contrast , although foxg1 expression is significantly associated with its eqtl rs7160881 ( @xmath124 ) , there is no association between this snp and hap1 expression ( @xmath125 ) , and conditioning on foxg1 and hap1 s eqtl has only a limited effect ( @xmath126 ) ( figure [ fig - figs]d ) . using conditional independence tests ( section [ sec - direction ] ) , this results in a high - confidence prediction that hap1 @xmath127 foxg1 is causal .    a standard greedy bayesian network search algorithm @xcite was run on the aforementioned cluster of 324 genes . figure",

    "gene regulation networks reconstructed from omics data represent hypotheses about the downstream molecular implications of genetic variations in a particular cell or tissue type .",
    "an essential first step towards using these networks in concrete applications ( e.g. discovering novel candidate drug target genes and pathways ) consists of validating them using independent data .",
    "the following is a non - exhaustive list of typical _ in silico _ validation experiments .",
    "[ [ model - likelihood - comparison - and - cross - validation . ] ] model likelihood comparison and cross - validation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when different algorithms are used to infer gene network models , their log - likelihoods can be compared to select the best one .",
    "( with the caveat that the same data that was used to learn the models is used to compare them , this comparison is meaningful only when the algorithms optimize _ exactly _ the same ( penalized ) log - likelihood functions . ) in a @xmath128-fold cross - validation experiment , the available samples are divided into @xmath128 subsets of approximately equal size . for each subset",
    ", models are learned from a dataset consisting of the @xmath129 other subsets , and the model likelihood is calculated using only the unseen data subset .",
    "thus , cross - validation is used to test the generalisability of the inferred network models to unseen data . for an example where model likelihood comparison and cross - validation were used to compare two module network inference strategies , see @xcite .",
    "[ [ functional - enrichment . ] ] functional enrichment .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    organism - specific gene ontology databases contain structured functional gene annotations @xcite .",
    "these databases can be used to construct gene signature sets composed of genes annotated to the same biological process , molecular function or cellular component .",
    "reconstructed gene networks can then be validated by testing for enriched connectivity of gene signature sets using a method proposed by @xcite . for a given gene set",
    ", this method considers all network nodes belonging to the set and their nearest neighbours , and from this set of nodes and edges , the largest connected sub - network is identified .",
    "then the enrichment of the gene set in this sub - network is tested using the fisher exact test and compared to the enrichment of randomly selected gene sets of the same size .",
    "[ [ comparison - with - physical - interaction - networks . ] ] comparison with physical interaction networks .",

    "a more appropriate validation is therefore to test for enrichment for short connection paths in the physical networks between pairs predicted to interact in the reconstructed networks @xcite .",
    "[ [ gene - perturbation - experiments . ] ] gene perturbation experiments .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    gene knock - out experiments provide the ultimate gold standard of a causal network intervention , and genes differentially expressed between knock - out and control experiments can be considered as true positive direct or indirect targets of the knocked - out gene . predicted gene networks can be validated by compiling relevant ( i.e. performed in a relevant cell or tissue type ) gene knock - out experiments from the * gene expression omnibus * ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) or * arrayexpress * ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ ) and comparing the overlap between gene sets responding to a gene knock - out and network genes predicted to be downstream of the knocked - out gene .",
    "overlap significance can be estimated by using randomized networks with the same degree distribution as the predicted network .",
    "although combining genotype and transcriptome data to reconstruct causal gene networks has led to important discoveries in a variety of applications @xcite , important details are not incorporated in the resulting network models , particularly regarding the causal molecular mechanisms linking eqtls to their target genes , and the relation between variation in transcript levels and protein levels , with the latter ultimately determining phenotypic responses .",
    "several recent studies have shown that at the molecular level , _",
    "cis_-eqtls primarily cause variation in transcription factor binding to gene regulatory dna elements , which then causes changes in histone modifications , dna methylation and mrna expression of nearby genes ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "although mrna expression can be used as a surrogate for protein expression , due to diverse post - transcriptional regulation mechanisms , the correlation between mrna and protein levels is known to be modest @xcite , and genetic loci that affect mrna and protein expression levels do not always overlap @xcite .",
    "thus , an ideal systems genetics study would integrate genotype data and molecular measurements at all levels of gene regulation from a large number of individuals .",
    "human lymphblastoid cell lines ( lcl ) are emerging as the primary model system to test such a approach .",
    "whole - genome mrna and micro - rna sequencing data are available for 462 lcl samples from five populations genotyped by the 1000 genomes project @xcite ; protein levels from quantitative mass spectrometry for 95 samples @xcite ; ribosome occupancy levels from sequencing of ribosome - protected mrna for 50 samples @xcite ; dna - occupancy levels of the regulatory tf pu.1 , the rna polymerase ii subunit rbp2 , and three histone modifications from chip - sequencing of 47 samples @xcite ; and the same three histone modifications from chip - sequencing of 75 samples @xcite .",
    "these population - level datasets can be combined further with three - dimensional chromatin contact data from hi - c @xcite and chia - pet @xcite , knock - down experiments followed by microarray measurements for 59 transcription - associated factors and chromatin modifiers @xcite , as well as more than 260 encode assays ( including chip - sequencing of 130 tfs ) @xcite in a reference lcl cell line ( gm12878 ) .",
    "although the number of samples where all measures are simultaneously available is currently small , this number is sure to rise in the coming years , along with the availability of similar measurements in other cell types . despite the challenging heterogeneity of data and analyses in the integration of multi - omics data , web - based toolboxes , such as * genomespace * ( http://www.genomespace.org ) @xcite can prove helpful to non - programmer researchers .",
    "in this chapter we have reviewed the main methods and softwares to carry out a systems genetics analysis , which combines genotype and various omics data to identify eqtls and their associated genes , reconstruct co - expression networks and modules , reconstruct causal bayesian gene and module networks , and validate predicted networks _ in silico_. several method and software options are available for each of these steps , and by necessity a subjective choice about which ones to include had to be made , based largely on their ability to handle large datasets , their popularity in the field , and our personal experience of using them . where methods have been compared in the literature ,",
    "they have usually been performed on a small number of datasets for a specific subset of tasks , and results have rarely been conclusive .",
    "that is , although each of the presented methods will give somewhat different results , no objective measurements will consistently select one of them as the `` best '' one . given this lack of objective criterion , the reader may well prefer to use a single software that allows to perform all of the presented analyses , but such an integrated software does not currently exist .",
    "nearly all of the examples discussed referred to the integration of genotype and transcriptome data , reflecting the current dominant availability of these two data types .",
    "however , omics technologies are evolving at a fast pace , and it is clear that data on the variation of tf binding , histone modifications , and post - transcriptional and protein expression levels will soon become more widely available . developing appropriate statistical models and computational methods to infer causal gene regulation networks from these multi - omics datasets is surely the most important challenge for the field .",
