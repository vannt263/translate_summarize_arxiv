    "molecular line data can place strong limits on molecular abundances within b68 because its density structure has been so well constrained by all01 .",
    "for example , abundances can be estimated by calculating with a monte carlo code the radiative transfer , molecular excitation , and line emission through a model of a dense core with a specific density profile , and varying abundances within the model until the output matches the observed data .",
    "for this purpose , we used the one - dimensional monte carlo code of hogerheijde & van der tak ( 2000 ) which can solve molecular excitation coupled with line and continuum radiative transfer in core models .",

    "the @xmath28 parameter identifies the particular solution from the family that solves the second - order differential equation characterizing a bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "we determined the density in 30 linearly - spaced concentric shells by solving that differential equation with a fourth - order runge - kutta method ( see press et al .",
    "the central density in the all01 model for b68 is @xmath52.5 @xmath19 10@xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "molecular abundances were assumed to be constant with radius , although abundance gradients within b68 are quite possible for the molecular species considered here .",
    "for example , bergin et al . found edge - to - center contrasts in the abundances of c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 of 100 and 2 respectively using their own maps of b68 . with only single pointings for the single - dish data and non - detections for the interferometer data , we can derive abundance values or upper limits only at the positions listed in table 1 , averaged over the respective lines - of - sight and beam widths , and can not probe for abundance gradients .",
    "gradients should not produce dramatic differences in the abundances we derive , however , given the small sizes of the beam widths relative to the spatial extent of b68 .",
    "for example , we note in  4.2 little difference between our abundances of c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 and those derived by bergin et al . at positions observed in common , despite our different abundance profiles .",
    "the velocity field of the gas was assumed to have a turbulent line width of 0.4 km s@xmath15 ( see wang et al . ;",
    "since the lines are optically thin at the abundances found , the integrated intensity is independent of the adopted turbulent line width . )",
    "we assume that each shell is stationary , although bergin et al .",
    "suggest velocity variations within b68 may be significant . for reasons similar to those cited above for abundance gradients , we did not consider radial variations of line width .    in each shell ,",
    "level populations were determined assuming standard collision rates for each molecule .",

    ", the original cubes were convolved with gaussians with widths appropriately representing the resolution of the respective observations .",
    "the abundances were varied until the observational data were well matched .",
    "table 2 lists the fractional abundances of the sampled molecular species at various positions toward b68 , constrained with the data described in  2 , and estimated by using the method described in  3 ( assuming models with the bonnor - ebert density profile of all01 . ) the bima data yield the first upper limits to the abundances of hco@xmath3 toward the extinction peak of b68 , as well as upper limits to the abundances of @xmath4co , c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 at the same location . since collision rates are not available for hoc@xmath3 , we do not attempt to place limits on its abundance .",

    "finally , other single - dish data of b68 from the literature yield new abundance values of c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 at some of these latter locations .      how do the abundances derived for b68 here compare to those derived for other clouds ? ",

    "some comparison , table 2 also lists the fractional abundance estimates of the same species in clouds similar in character to b68 , obtained directly from the literature but made without the detailed foreknowledge of cloud density structure now available for b68 .",

    "1997 , or dickens et al .",

    "for example , turner notes abundances can vary by an order of magnitude both between different translucent clouds and within larger , dense clouds ( presumably determined using similar assumptions . )",
    "table 2 shows that every value of molecular abundance we derive for b68 is less than the lowest value derived for other clouds . from the bima data , we find the upper limits to the @xmath4co , hco@xmath3 , and n@xmath2h@xmath3 abundances in b68 are lower than values derived for other clouds by factors of 7 , 14 , and 4 respectively .",
    "( the upper limit to the c@xmath0o abundance is similar to the lowest value found for other clouds . ) from the various single - dish data , we find the c@xmath0o , cs , and h@xmath2co abundances differ least , by roughly an order of magnitude or less , with the b68 abundances lower than the lowest values derived for other clouds by factors of only 5 , 3 , and 16 respectively at the locations observed . however , the n@xmath2h@xmath3 , nh@xmath1 , and c@xmath1h@xmath2 abundances differ the most , by over an order of magnitude , with those of b68 lower by factors of 25 , 29 , and 170 respectively at the locations observed .    the assumption in our models of an isothermal bonnor - ebert sphere , at the same 16  k temperature derived by bourke et al . and used by all01 , has likely minimized the resulting abundance values we obtain .",
    "other temperature profiles , such as those suggested for bonnor - ebert spheres by zucconi , walmsley , and galli ( 2001 ; see also evans et al . 2001 ) which have cooler temperatures at small radii , may be more appropriate .",
    "for example , bergin et al . assumed for their models of b68 the zucconi et al .",
    "radial temperature profile with a global reduction of 2  k , in addition to the all01 density profile . with this same temperature profile in our models , the values in table 2",
    "increase by factors of only 23 .",
    "therefore , using this radial temperature profile would bring the abundances of c@xmath0o , cs , and h@xmath2co at the positions observed in b68 even more in line with the abundances found for other cloud types .",
    "however , the abundances of n@xmath2h@xmath3 , nh@xmath1 , and c@xmath1h@xmath2 at other positions would still remain lower than those of other clouds by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "only n@xmath2h@xmath3 , nh@xmath1 , and c@xmath1h@xmath2 are arguably depleted in b68 , given the values shown in table 2 and assuming a typical order of magnitude abundance variation between and within similar clouds . however , other species considered here still may be depleted in b68 .",
    "note that the degree to which the abundance of a particular species in b68 is low compared to those of other clouds appears related to the position across b68 that the respective data were obtained .",
    "the c@xmath0o , cs , and n@xmath2h@xmath3 data from the literature were those of maximum line brightness from maps of b68 , and h@xmath2co and c@xmath1h@xmath2 data were obtained only subsequently by the respective authors at those positions .",
    "( nh@xmath1 was observed only at the clemens & barvainis position of b68 . )",
    "figure 1 and table 2 together reveal that the less - discrepant abundances are found at positions relatively far from the extinction peak but the more - discrepant abundances are found at positions closer to the extinction peak ( except notably nh@xmath1 . ) this pattern suggests c@xmath1h@xmath2 may be also depleted by some process related to extinction , e.g. , the sublimation of gas - phase molecules onto grains , as suggested by bergin et al . for c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 and hotzel et al . for @xmath4co and c@xmath0o .",

    "<S> the abundances were determined using our own bima millimeter interferometer data and single - dish data gathered from the literature , in conjunction with a monte carlo radiative transfer model . since b68 is the only starless core to have its density structure strongly constrained via extinction mapping , a major uncertainty has been removed from these determinations . </S>",
    "<S> all abundances for b68 are lower than those derived for translucent and cold dense clouds , but perhaps only significantly for n@xmath2h@xmath3 , nh@xmath1 , and c@xmath1h@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> depletion of cs toward the extinction peak of b68 is hinted at by the large offset between the extinction peak and the position of maximum cs line brightness . </S>",
    "<S> abundances derived here for c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 are consistent with other , recently determined values at positions observed in common . </S>"
