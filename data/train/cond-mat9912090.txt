    "the systematic study of sub - dominant terms in scaling provides researchers with guidelines on how to extrapolate e.g. finite - size results to the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "also , it may in itself bring out connections to underlying physical properties .",
    "these latter may be universal , such as the relationship between critical free - energy finite - width correction and conformal anomaly of the corresponding universality class  @xcite , or otherwise relate to details of the system under consideration  @xcite . in the present work we investigate the possible existence of a link between lattice structure and presence ( or absence ) of specific subdominant terms in finite - size scaling .",
    "a numerical analysis is made of correlation - length and free energy data at criticality , as given by the largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix ( tm )  @xcite , for ising and three - state potts ferromagnets on strips of square , triangular and honeycomb lattices with homogeneous , isotropic nearest - neighbour couplings , and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) across .",
    "we recall the following results from conformal invariance  @xcite for the critical spin - spin correlation length , @xmath2 , and ( dimensionless ) negative free energy per site , @xmath3 , on strips of width @xmath0 sites with pbc  @xcite : @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the decay - of - correlations exponent and @xmath7 the conformal anomaly number , with respective exact values @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( ising ) ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( three - state potts )  @xcite . in terms of the two largest eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the column - to - column tm , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; the factor @xmath16 is unity for the square lattice and , in triangular or honeycomb geometries , corrects for the fact that the physical length added upon each application of the tm differs from one lattice spacing  @xcite .",
    "studies of the operator content of conformally invariant theories , and the perturbation theory ( for finite - size systems , with @xmath17 as the perturbation variable ) for the corresponding operator product expansion  @xcite have shown how , in two dimensions , the allowed values of the exponents @xmath18 , @xmath19 etc are related to the scaling dimensions of the respective set of ( model - specific ) irrelevant operators .",
    "these exponents are therefore universal , as the set of their allowed values is fixed for a given model .",
    "it must be noted that terms with @xmath20 , the so - called `` analytical '' corrections , are expected in any theory , as they are related to the conformal block of the identity operator  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown  @xcite that no first - order corrections are expected for ground - state energies , the dominant terms being second - order ; this will be particularly relevant for the three - state potts model , as seen below .",
    "many numerical studies of corrections to scaling pertaining to two - dimensional classical ( i.e. ising , potts etc ) systems have actually been carried out in their _",
    "one_-dimensional _ quantum _ counterparts  @xcite , by taking advantage of well - known correspondences  @xcite . while this is expected to have no effect on the determination of the universal correction exponents , the amplitudes @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 etc",
    "are generally believed to be non - universal , though e. g. in certain quantum chain systems they display similar dependences ( privman - fisher universality )  @xcite on the anisotropy parameter  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the relationship between @xmath25-dimensional chains and two - dimensional spin systems is such that the latter are necessarily located on a square lattice .",
    "thus , much less is known about corrections to scaling for spins on , say , triangular or honeycomb symmetries than on their square counterpart .",
    "so far , the only explicit ( published ) reference to the connection between lattice symmetry and corrections to scaling seems to be a remark on the fact that , on a square lattice operators of spin @xmath26 will appear , giving rise to @xmath1 corrections  @xcite .",
    "our main purpose here is to estimate , through numerical work , the first ( i.e. lowest - order ) few amplitudes and exponents as given in equations  ( [ eq:1 ] ) and  ( [ eq:2 ] ) , for ising and three - state potts spins on square , triangular and honeycomb geometries .",
    "we shall usually assume , for each model , definite values for the two or three exponents used in our fits , taking our hints from conformal invariance theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we shall seek instances in which , for a given spin model and exponent , the corresponding amplitude appears to vanish for one or more lattices and is non - zero otherwise .",
    "the idea of linking accidentally ( or otherwise ) vanishing amplitudes to underlying physical properties has been exploited fruitfully in the past  @xcite : the absence of vacancy corrections ( with an exponent @xmath27 ) has been demonstrated for some ising - like models , implying completeness of the corresponding set of irrelevant operators ; investigation also showed that this is particular to ising systems , and that for @xmath28 potts spins such corrections are of order @xmath29 .",
    "in the present case , we expect to probe the interplay between lattice symmetries and the set of irrelevant operators for the respective spin systems . to our knowledge ,",
    "no attempt to draw such a connection has been made , despite the wealth of data available for two - dimensional conformally invariant systems .",
    "we start by considering the ising model .",
    "exact expressions for the eigenvalues of the tm are available for all lattices concerned : square  @xcite , triangular  @xcite and honeycomb  @xcite . from their inspection ,",
    "one readily sees that the finite - size estimates @xmath2 and @xmath3 of equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) must have well - defined parity as functions of @xmath17",
    ". therefore we assume , consistently with : ( i ) analytical evidence derived for @xmath2 on square  @xcite and honeycomb  @xcite lattices ( ii ) numerical analysis of @xmath3 on the square lattice  @xcite ; ( iii ) the universal result connecting @xmath3 and conformal anomaly  @xcite , and ( iv ) results for quantum ising chains  @xcite , that for all cases one has : @xmath30 @xmath31 the bulk free energies @xmath32 can be calculated in closed form  @xcite , again for all three lattices . truncating the series above at @xmath33 ,",
    "one gets finite - size approximants ( also referred to as two - point fits ) to the amplitudes @xmath34 , @xmath35 from pairs of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for consecutive widths @xmath36 and @xmath0 ( @xmath37 and @xmath0 for the honeycomb ) .",
    "the approximants themselves still exhibit a weak @xmath0-dependence , on account of the truncation just mentioned .",
    "in fact they usually converge rather smoothly as @xmath0 increases , allowing reliable extrapolations to be produced ; for example , @xmath21 for the square lattice agrees with the exact result  @xcite to two parts in @xmath38 .",
    "we have found the sequences of two - point fits for @xmath21 , @xmath23 to behave better than those for @xmath22 , @xmath24 . for these",
    "latter on triangular and honeycomb geometries , as well as @xmath23 on the triangular lattice , numerical instabilities or sudden trend reversals arose for large @xmath0 ; the worst such cases were @xmath22 , @xmath24 on the triangular lattice where behaviour changed abruptly for @xmath39 .",
    "we did not pursue the analysis of such deviations , since by then we already had a fairly large sample of well - behaved data from which to extrapolate ( albeit with less accuracy than in other instances , where monotonic trends seem to extend all the way as @xmath40 ; for instance , from a logarithmic plot one finds for the honeycomb @xmath41 for @xmath42  ) .",
    "graphical illustrations and extrapolated numerical estimates are shown respectively in figure  [ fig:1 ] ( where use of @xmath43 on the horizontal axis is for ease of representation , not implying assumption of a specific scaling form ) , and table 1 .",

    "in order to check whether the ( apparently exact ) vanishing of the analytical corrections is a model - independent , purely lattice - related phenomenon , we proceeded to study the next simplest spin system , the three - state potts ferromagnet . exact critical temperatures and exponents , and closed forms for bulk free energies , are again avaliable for all three lattices  @xcite . compared to the ising case ,",
    "the main differences are : ( i ) no exact expressions are forthcoming for the eigenvalues of the tm , implying that one must rely on numerical diagonalisation , and also that the simple argument for definite parity of eigenvalues as functions of @xmath17 , plausible in the ising case , need not apply here ; and ( ii ) ( corroborating the point just made ) a correction exponent @xmath54 is expected to arise  @xcite , overshadowing higher - order terms .",
    "we tackled ( i ) by generating the data displayed in table 2 , for strip widths @xmath55 ( square ) ; @xmath56 ( triangular ) and @xmath57 ( honeycomb ; @xmath0 even ) .",
    "the data in part ( b ) are displayed without the geometric factor @xmath16 , in order to match the bulk free energies as given in closed form in ref .",

    "( ii ) , we took recourse to predictions from conformal invariance , namely : ( a ) analytical ( @xmath1 ) corrections are always expected  @xcite ; ( b ) first - order corrections to the ground - state free energy must be absent  @xcite .",
    "therefore we assumed : @xmath66 @xmath67 because of the small value of @xmath68 , second , and even third  order perturbation terms may give rise to corrections of comparable magnitude to the analytical ones .",
    "obviously , one can not simultaneously and reliably fit all coefficients displayed in equations  ( [ eq : etap ] ) and ( [ eq : fep ] ) from the data of table 2 .",
    "we thus resorted to selective truncations .",
    "recall that our main goal is to check whether the presence or absence of analytical corrections follows the same lattice - dependent pattern found above .    for correlation - length data we started by trying ( a1 )",
    "two - point fits for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , assuming @xmath71 ; ( a2 ) same for @xmath69 and @xmath21 , assuming @xmath72 ; ( b1 ) three - point fits for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath21 ; ( b2 ) three - point fits for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath73 , assuming @xmath74 .",

    "= 10.5 cm    for each lattice , all procedures gave reasonably consistent trends for @xmath69 , no doubt because of the small value of @xmath68 , and the wide gap separating it from all other assumed secondary exponents ; on the other hand , since these latter are so close to one another , we could generally extract no clear - cut information from their respective fitted coefficients : in all cases , any pair of terms ( or single term ) among @xmath70 , @xmath21 , @xmath73 could do a reasonable job of standing in for effective corrections when the other(s ) was ( were ) assumed absent .",
    "further , we noticed that sequences of finite-@xmath0 estimates were much more stable than any of the above if we used an _ ad hoc _ form inspired in the ising case , namely @xmath76 indeed , in figure  [ fig:2 ] one sees that , although for each lattice all forms ( a1)(b2 ) yield estimates of @xmath69 whose extrapolated values might conceivably coincide ( as illustrated by the splines ) , data from equation  ( [ eq : etap2 ] ) exhibit the smallest residual @xmath0-dependence of all , leading to the least uncertainties upon extrapolation .",
    "such stability shows up also in the estimates of @xmath21 of equation  ( [ eq : etap2 ] ) and , to a more limited extent , in those of @xmath23 .",
    "this contrasts with the corresponding sequences of @xmath70 etc in procedures ( a1)(b2 ) , which generally display a much broader variation .",
    "see table 3 for the respective extrapolations against @xmath43 .",
    "the small absolute values of @xmath21 for triangular and honeycomb lattices remind one of the corresponding case for ising spins . for ( a2 ) on the triangular lattice , and ( b1 ) on the honeycomb , error bars actually include the origin",
    ". however , turning now to the most regular series given by equation  ( [ eq : etap2 ] ) , we recall that the respective estimates are reached by crossing the horizontal axis , on extrapolation of rather monotonic sequences ; so it seems improbable that by e. g. going to larger widths a change of trend would occur , causing error bars to be consistent with @xmath77 in this case .",

    "the results were generally undistinguished , much as was the case for @xmath6 above .",
    "the only exception was ( a2 ) for the square lattice where , contrary to all other cases , we found a steadily growing @xmath94 with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this clearly signals , consistently with earlier results  @xcite , that for the square lattice analytical terms are present with a large coefficient .    in order to make contact with conformal invariance work",
    ", we investigated the convergence of @xmath92 and @xmath22 in procedure ( a1 ) , for the square lattice .",
    "we found these estimates to vary significantly with @xmath0 ; in fact , bulirsch - stoer  @xcite extrapolations pointed to effective corrections @xmath96 , @xmath97 , with respective final estimates @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "this gives a value @xmath100 for the ratio @xmath101 , to be compared to reinicke s estimate , @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "given the number and severity of approximations involved in our calculations , this result may be regarded as broadly consistent with universality of the ratio @xmath101 , as expected from conformal invariance .    since , for all procedures and lattices , the overall picture was very similar to that described in the preceding paragraph , we decided to try the simpler scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely assuming effective one - power corrections @xmath103 , and allowing @xmath68 to vary , searching for good fits .",
    "we determined the following optimum values for @xmath68 : @xmath104 , ( square lattice , again in accord with the early estimate @xmath20  @xcite ) ; @xmath105 ( triangular ) ; @xmath106 ( honeycomb ) .",
    "similarly scattered results arose recently from monte - carlo calculations of magnetisation , susceptibility and specific heat for three - state potts spins on square @xmath107 systems  @xcite , where widely differing values of @xmath68 were obtained for the corrections of each quantity . as regards the possible connection between lattice symmetry and presence , or absence , of analytical corrections , the above one - power corrections are broadly consistent with a similar picture to that found for ising systems . in such scenario , the triangular- and honeycomb- effective exponents would reflect a non - zero coefficient for @xmath108 , and a null one for the analytical term , while for the square lattice the explanation would be as discussed above : both terms are present , with @xmath1 having an amplitude one order of magnitude larger than @xmath109 .",
    "we have analysed corrections to scaling in critical ising and three - state potts ferromagnets on the three main two - dimensional lattices . by studying the simplest non - trivial systems available and well - defined lattice symmetries , we have left aside e.g. anisotropy - induced crossover phenomena and dealt with power - law finite - size corrections alone , avoiding marginal operators ( which arise in four - state potts systems , for instance ) with their associated logarithmic terms .",
    "we have given strong evidence that the amplitudes of the @xmath1 corrections of inverse correlation length and free energy of ising systems vanish both on triangular and honeycomb geometries , but not on the square lattice .",
    "for the inverse correlation length of the potts model , the main correction is well fitted by an @xmath110 term , in accord with theory and earlier numerical work  @xcite .",
    "we have found the values of the @xmath1 coefficients for the triangular and honeycomb lattices to be certainly much smaller than for a square geometry , though we have not been able to ascertain that they vanish .    for potts free energies ,",
    "the @xmath110 term is always absent , as predicted by conformal invariance  @xcite ; we have estimated the power arising in an effective single - term correction to be an apparently lattice - dependent exponent in the range @xmath111 .",
    "our results for the square lattice are consistent with earlier work , in predicting @xmath109 and @xmath1 corrections whose amplitude ratio is @xmath100 , to be compared with the previously obtained estimate @xmath102  @xcite . as regards triangular and honeycomb geometries , the respective exponents for the effective single - term corrections are much closer to @xmath112 ( the second - order perturbation value predicted by conformal invariance ) than to 2 . this may , or may not , mean that the @xmath1 term is absent in these cases .",
    "several questions arise : ( i ) can one prove , e.g. on the basis of conformal invariance properties , that the amplitudes of the @xmath1 corrections are exactly zero for triangular and honeycomb ising systems ?",
    "if so , ( ii ) how do such amplitudes behave e.g. in an anisotropic triangular lattice as one crosses over towards a square symmetry , by reducing the strength of the bonds along one of its main directions ? and ( iii ) how does the @xmath113state potts model behave in triangular or honeycomb geometries , as regards the @xmath1 correction ?",
    "( iv ) do the amplitudes of the @xmath1 corrections really vanish for the three - state potts model on the same lattices as it appears to be the case for ising systems ?",
    "if so , can it be established by conformal invariance theory ? we plan to investigate numerical aspects of these and related matters in future work .",

    "<S> for potts spins , our results are broadly consistent with this lattice - dependent pattern of cancellations , though for correlation lengths non - vanishing ( albeit rather small ) amplitudes can not be entirely ruled out .    </S>",
