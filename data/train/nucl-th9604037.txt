    "it is one of the most important goals of the nuclear theory to reproduce and predict the nuclear ground - state energy and other properties globally in the nuclear chart within a single framework .",
    "a variety of theoretical models have been introduced for this goal .",
    "the most elaborate works have been done in the framework of the finite - range droplet model with a microscopic shell correction ( frdm ) , whose latest result was given by mller et al .",
    "another extensive calculation was carried out by aboussir et al .",
    "@xcite in the extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral method ( etfsi ) .",
    "the former as well as the latter methods can be regarded as approximations to the hartree - fock ( hf ) equation .",
    "the straight - forward solutions of the equation including deformation require long computation time for global calculations even with present computers .",
    "such global results are not yet available to the public as far as we know . in this paper , we report on the results of our extensive hf+bcs calculation with the skyrme siii force for 1029 even - even nuclei having atomic number ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and neutron number from outside the proton drip line to beyond the experimental neutron - rich frontier .",
    "we use a hf+bcs code _ ev8 _",
    "@xcite , in which the single - particle wavefunctions are expressed in a three - dimensional cartesian - mesh representation , while most of the other methods for deformed nuclei express the single - particle wavefunctions by the expansion in a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "let us mention three advantages of the mesh representation .",
    "first , it is capable of treating nucleon skins and halos .",
    "in contrast , they can not be described efficiently in the oscillator - basis expansion because the asymptotic form of wavefunctions far from the nuclear surface is determined by the basis .",
    "second , one can treat exotic ( e.g. , high - multipole ) shapes and large ( e.g. , super and hyper ) deformations without preparing a basis specific to each shape .",
    "third , the saturation property of density makes the atomic nucleus a very suitable object to the mesh representation , as we discuss in section [ s_basis ] .",
    "this paper is mainly concerned with the proton - rich nuclei than the neutron - rich ones .",
    "we thoroughly explore the proton - rich side , even to beyond the proton drip line by several neutrons , while restricting the investigations in the neutron - rich side within the experimental frontier plus a few neutrons .",
    "this is because the hf+bcs method used in this paper can not correctly include the coupling in the pairing channel with the continuum , which can be influential in nuclei near the neutron drip line@xcite .",
    "the hf+bcs method including the coupling with the continuum gives rise to unphysical neutron gas surrounding the nucleus .",
    "the solution of this problem requires the hartree - fock - bogolyubov method , with which ordinary and pair densities are spatially localized when the fermi level is at a negative energy@xcite . on the other hand , for nuclei near the proton drip line ,",
    "the hf+bcs method is still applicable in practice to obtain localized solutions because the coulomb barrier confines the wavefunctions of low - and - positive as well as negative energy levels .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . in the next section",
    ", we survey the features of the three - dimensional cartesian - mesh representation , discuss the choice of the interaction , and explain the points newly developed in the present paper for extensive calculations . among these points",
    "are the determination of the pairing force strengths and the acceleration of the convergence to the solution .    in section [ s_mass ]",
    ", we compare the atomic masses obtained from our calculations with those in the latest experimental mass table@xcite .",
    "for this purpose , we consider a correction for the error in the total binding energy due to the finite mesh size : a greatly high precision is necessary in calculating the binding energy compared with other quantities like moments .",
    "section  [ s_deform ] treats the deformation .",
    "we compare the electric axial quadrupole moments with those deduced from the experimental b(e2)@xmath5 data@xcite .",
    "we also discuss the deformation parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , which we define for the hf+bcs solutions in terms of multipole moments , and compare them with those of the frdm .",
    "the difference of shapes between protons and neutrons as well as the difference of the energies between the prolate and the oblate solutions are also discussed .",
    "we choose a shape coexisting nucleus @xmath11zr@xmath12 to illustrate the strong dependence on the force parameters of the landscape of the potential energy curve along the axial - quadrupole - deformation path .",
    "the proton and the neutron skins are the subject of section  [ s_skin ] .",
    "we discuss the thickness , the anisotropy , and the relation with the halo radius .    in the last section ,",
    "the contents of this paper is summarized and an instruction to obtain our results electronically via computer network is given .",
    "the main feature of the hf+bcs code _",
    "ev8 _ used in this paper is the three - dimensional cartesian - mesh representation : each single - particle wavefunction @xmath13 is defined in a rectangular box ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) with its values @xmath17 at cubic mesh points , ( @xmath18 ) = @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 take on integers . in this study ,",
    "the mesh size @xmath25 is set to 1 fm , while the size of the box is @xmath26 fm , @xmath27 fm for @xmath28 and @xmath29 fm , @xmath30 fm for @xmath31 .",
    "the nucleus is placed at the center of the box .",
    "we impose a symmetry with respect to reflections in @xmath32-@xmath33 , @xmath33-@xmath34 , and @xmath34-@xmath32 planes ( the point group d@xmath35 ) .",
    "this symmetry allows triaxial solutions , although all of our solutions have eventually turned out axial and stable against @xmath36-deformation . on the other hand",
    ", the symmetry prohibits odd - multipole deformations , which may not be negligible in some actinide nuclei . according to the calculations with the frdm@xcite",
    ", the nucleus @xmath37ra@xmath38 has the largest octupole deformation ( @xmath39 = 0.15 , the energy gain due to the octupole deformation is @xmath40 mev ) , while except in the neighborhood of this nucleus the octupole deformation occurs only in odd-@xmath41 and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "incidentally , both in light@xcite and heavy nuclei@xcite , the octupole deformation is likely to be enhanced by the procedure of the variation after parity projection",
    ".    one might wonder that a mesh size of 1 fm were too large to describe the abrupt change of density at nuclear surface .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , that a mesh size @xmath25=1 fm can produce enough accurate results for several spherical nuclei with mass below @xmath42pb .",
    "we did a similar test of accuracy for a deformed actinide nucleus @xmath43pu@xmath44 and found that the relative errors of the quadrupole moment and the total energy are 0.4% and 0.5% , respectively .",
    "( the method of extrapolation to @xmath45 is explained in section [ s_correction ] . )",
    "this order of accuracy is higher than necessary for the quadrupole moment , while it is not for the energy to make comparison with experiments .",
    "considering that the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "deviation of the atomic masses of recent mass formulae is @xmath46 0.5 mev , the desirable precision is of the order of 0.1 mev , which is only 0.005% of the total binding energy of @xmath47pu .",
    "therefore , the binding energy , but not the other quantities , has to be corrected for the effect of the finite mesh size , which is done in section  [ s_correction ] .",
    "the origin of this unexpectedly high accuracy with apparently coarse meshes has been explained by baye and heenen@xcite .",
    "the equation to determine @xmath48 is usually derived through a discrete approximation to the schrdinger equation .",
    "they presented an alternative point of view , in which they introduced a set of orthogonal basis functions @xmath49 such that @xmath50 are the coefficients to expand @xmath13 in this basis .",
    "( in this point of view , the equation for @xmath50 is determined uniquely from the variational principle . )",
    "this basis can be unitary - transformed to plane - wave basis with @xmath51 ( @xmath52 = @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , which suggests that the atomic nucleus is a very suitable physical object to apply the mesh representation because the saturation property of nuclear matter guarantees the suppression of large - momentum components in wavefunctions from the view point of the thomas - fermi approximation .    to enjoy this high accuracy , the method to determine @xmath50 must be in accordance with the view point of baye and heenen .",
    "exact variational treatment with the plane - wave basis requires , however , long computation time and diminish the simplicity of the cartesian - mesh representation . the code _",
    "ev8 _ is designed to emulate the plane - wave expansion method , though it is based on the discrete approximations , by choosing the appropriate orders of approximation formulae for derivatives ( the 7- and 9-point formulae for the first and second derivatives , respectively ) and integrals ( the mid - point formula ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a new formulation of the mesh representation in terms of collocation basis splines is being developed recently by chinn et al.@xcite .      for the hf ( mean - field )",
    "part of the interaction , the code uses the skyrme interaction@xcite , which is a zero - range force with the lowest order momentum dependences to emulate the finite - range effects , a density dependence to reproduce the saturation of nuclear matter density , and a spin - orbit coupling term",
    ".    the relation between the skyrme - hf model and the relativistic mean - field model@xcite has been discussed by many authors ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which has invoked arguments on the density dependence ( the ratio of the isoscalar to the isovector density dependences ) of the spin - orbit term@xcite . however , as these arguments are not yet conclusive , we rather like to use the old but well - examined standard form of the skyrme force in this paper .    among the many parameter sets proposed for the skyrme force@xcite , we choose the siii@xcite . its validity has been examined in many nuclear structure calculations . in particular , it produces single - particle spectra in good agreement with experiment .",
    "it also reproduces fairly well the @xmath53 dependence of the binding energy@xcite compared with other widely - used parameter sets of sgii@xcite and skm@xmath54@xcite .",
    "although its incompressibility is said to be too large , it is not a serious drawback because elaborate fittings of the parameters of the skyrme force@xcite and the frdm@xcite have shown that different assumptions for the incompressibility lead to practically the same quality of fittings to nuclear masses .",
    "the force sksc4@xcite was determined through the most extensive fitting to nuclear mass data among the skyrme forces .",
    "however , the fitting was done in the etfsi scheme , which produces unnegligibly different energy from that of the hf method .",
    "because of this disadvantage , we do not choose the force sksc4 in this paper .",
    "for the interaction in the pairing channel , we employ a seniority force @xmath55 , whose pair - scattering matrix elements are defined as a constant multiplied by cutoff factors depending on the single - particle energy @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 signifies proton or neutron . we assume the following form for the cutoff function , @xmath59 which contains two cutoff energies , @xmath60 and @xmath61 : the former is for a smooth cutoff necessary to stabilize the iterative procedures to solve the hf equation , while the latter is for a sharp cutoff preventing occupation of spatially unlocalized single - particle states .",
    "the cutoff energies take on the following values , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fermi level defined as the average of the highest occupied level and the lowest vacant level in the hf ( or normal ) state .    in the bcs treatment of nuclei",
    "far from the @xmath64-stability line , one has to take care so that the continuum states are not occupied , which give rise to unphysical nucleon gas extending over the entire box . in our calculations , for neutrons ,",
    "if the right - hand side of the second of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_ec ] ) is positive , @xmath65 is replaced by zero ( for @xmath28 ) or @xmath66 is replaced by @xmath67 mev ( for @xmath31 ) . for protons , instead of lowering the sharp cutoff energy @xmath68 , we modify the proton potential outside the coulomb barrier ( in the imaginary - time evolution operator , not in the evaluation of the energy ) so that the potential is higher than @xmath68 .",
    "this prevents the tunneling through the barrier and makes the proton single - particle wavefunctions whose energy is within the pairing active interval ( @xmath69 ) spatially localized .    in order to treat a wide range of nuclei on a single footing ,",
    "we need a prescription to determine the strength @xmath70 for each nucleus .",
    "for this purpose , we have developed a method based on the continuous spectrum approximation .",
    "we solve the following particle - number and gap equations , @xmath71 which use the semiclassical single - particle level density @xmath72 ( obtained in the thomas - fermi approximation ) instead of the discrete spectrum of the single - particle hf hamiltonian .",
    "one notes that @xmath72 does not have the fluctuation due to the shell effects .",
    "( [ eq_partnum ] ) determines the fermi level @xmath73 , while eq .",
    "( [ eq_gap ] ) tells the force strength @xmath70 when it is combined with the empirical formula for the pairing gap @xmath74 = @xmath75 mev . for light nuclei ,",
    "the resulting @xmath70 becomes apparently too strong .",
    "we replace @xmath70 with 0.6 mev when it exceeds 0.6 mev .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ s_gap ] .",
    "because the single - particle basis of the mesh representation is huge , it takes unmanageably long computation time to solve the hf+bcs equation with the usual method of iterative diagonalization of the single - particle hf hamiltonian @xmath76 .",
    "instead , the code _ ev8 _ employs a much more efficient method of imaginary - time evolution@xcite , in which the evolution operator for a small time interval @xmath77 is repeatedly operated on each single - particle wavefunction to decrease its expectation value of the energy . after each evolution",
    ", the single - particle wavefunctions are orthogonalized in the gram - schmidt method from low to high energy states . as the initial wavefunctions , we utilize either the eigenstates of the nilsson model or the solutions for the neighboring nuclei .",
    "the imaginary - time evolution operator @xmath78 is expanded to the first order in @xmath77 as @xmath79 . to this order",
    ", the imaginary - time evolution method is equivalent to the gradient iteration method@xcite . consequently , to obtain the minimum energy state rather than the maximum one",
    ", it must hold that @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the maximum single - particle eigenenergy , which is approximately the free kinetic energy for @xmath24 = @xmath82 . with @xmath25=1 fm",
    ", it follows @xmath83 sec ( the actual upper bound for @xmath77 is larger than this estimation because the discrete approximation underestimates the kinetic energy for very high momentum states ) .",
    "we use @xmath84 sec in this paper .",
    "we regard that the wavefunction is converged to a hf+bcs solution when the following four criteria are satisfied .",
    "\\i ) the energy spreading of single - particle states are smaller than 0.1 mev .",
    "practically , we require that the third largest value of @xmath85 should be less than ( 0.1 mev)@xmath86 , where @xmath87 represents the @xmath22th single - particle state and @xmath88 its bcs occupation probability .",

    "\\iii ) during the same period , the variation in @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are @xmath89 0.5 fm@xmath86 for @xmath28 and @xmath89 0.005 @xmath94 @xmath95 for @xmath31 , where @xmath58 stands for all the protons or all the neutrons and @xmath96 fm .",
    "\\iv ) the axial quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath97 is close to the convergent value .",
    "we adopt a definition @xmath97 @xmath98 3 @xmath99 / 4@xmath100@xcite , where @xmath101 @xmath98 @xmath102 .",
    "the convergent value , @xmath103 , together with its uncertainty , @xmath104 , are predicted using the values of @xmath97 during the last 200 steps is determined by an equation @xmath105=0 , where @xmath105 is the time derivative of @xmath97 and expressed as a quadratic function in @xmath97 whose coefficients are determined from the least - square fitting to the last @xmath106 steps .",
    "changing @xmath106 between 200 and 150 produces a set of values @xmath107 .",
    "the average of them is adopted as @xmath103 , while a half of the difference between the maximum and the minimum of them is used as the size of the error @xmath104 . ] .",
    "the condition is expressed as @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 + @xmath104 @xmath89 @xmath111 .",
    "for nuclei in the shape - transitional region this criterion is the last one to be satisfied among the four , because the potential energy surface ( pes ) is very flat versus @xmath97 .",
    "in order to accelerate the convergence when the wavefunction looks slowly converging to a state with deformation @xmath103 , we exert an external mass quadrupole potential during several tens of evolution steps so that the wavefunction quickly acquires the predicted deformation .",
    "then , we switch off the external potential and continue the free imaginary - time evolution . with this acceleration method , the necessary number of evolution steps to achieve convergence can be decreased by a factor larger than two .",
    "the reason why this method works is that the quadrupole deformation is almost always the softest mode in atomic nuclei ( under the d@xmath35 symmetry ) . on the other hand , in generic multi - dimensional minimization problems ,",
    "the principal difficulty is in finding the direction of the softest mode@xcite .    in the top portion of fig .",
    "[ f_conv ] we show histories of the imaginary - time evolution of the deformation parameter @xmath97 with ( solid curve ) and without ( dot curve ) the acceleration method for the prolate solution of @xmath112er@xmath113 .",
    "the sharp fall of the solid curve is due to the external quadrupole potential exerted between the time steps 213 and 291 .",
    "one can see that the convergence can be achieved within much shorter time than without the acceleration method .    in the bottom - left and bottom - right portions of the figure , the time evolution of the maximum spreading in the single - particle levels , eq .",
    "( [ eq_dei ] ) , and the total energy ( measured from the convergent value ) are displayed , respectively , for the same process as in the top portion .",
    "one can see that the convergence of these quantities are also advanced by using the external potential .",
    "all the solutions of our extensive hf+bcs calculation have been found axially symmetric .",
    "the stability of these solutions against triaxial deformation can be known from the time evolution of the ( very small ) triaxiality parameter when the external potential is not effective , because it should grow exponentially if the axial solution is a saddle point rather than a minimum .",
    "it has turned out that none of the axial solutions exhibit clearly such an exponential growth of the triaxiality .",
    "it is possible , however , that triaxial minima exist which are separated from the axial path by a potential barrier .",
    "bonche et al",
    ".  found triaxial ground - state solutions for @xmath114zr and @xmath115zr using the same skyrme interaction and the same computer code as we used .",
    "however , these triaxial minima look so shallow that they can easily be moved to axially symmetric shapes by , e.g. , making the pairing correlation slightly stronger .",
    "the treatment of the coulomb interaction is in line with the appendix  c of ref .",
    "@xcite : the exchange part of the interaction is approximated by a local potential in terms of the slater approximation . the direct part is implemented in terms of a coulomb potential obtained by solving the poisson equation using a three - point approximation to the second derivative .",
    "the boundary conditions are determined by , first , dividing the nucleus into two fragments in one of the @xmath32-@xmath33 , @xmath33-@xmath34 , and @xmath34-@xmath32 planes ( we select the plane which gives the largest distance between the centers of mass of the two fragments ) and , second , expanding the coulomb potential originating in each fragment in terms of multipole moments of protons through order three .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we treat a nucleon as a point particle , neglecting its extension .",
    "the effect of the spurious center of mass motion is corrected for by reducing the bare nucleon mass by a factor @xmath116 .",
    "the explicit form of the hamiltonian density is found in ref .",

    "spatially localized solutions have been obtained for 1029 nuclei .",
    "although some of these solutions have negative two - proton separation energies , their densities are localized owing to the coulomb barrier .",
    "the second local minima have been found for 758 nuclei .",
    "we determine the ground - state solution of each nucleus by , first , searching the spherical , a prolate , and an oblate solutions and , second , comparing the energies of thus obtained solutions .",
    "our strategy to search for these three solutions for each nucleus is as follows .",
    "the spherical solution is obtained by constraining the mass quadrupole moments to be zero .",
    "the prolate ( oblate ) solution is searched in two steps .",
    "first , we exert an external potential proportional to @xmath101 on the initial wavefunction until its quadrupole deformation parameter satisfies @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "second , we switch off the external potential , let the wavefunction evolve by itself ( or with the acceleration method described in section  [ s_solution ] ) , and see if it converges to a deformed local minimum . if the nuclear shape becomes very close to the sphericity in the course of evolution , i.e. @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) , we conclude that the normal - deformation prolate ( oblate ) solution does not exist in this nucleus .    for some nuclei with @xmath125 ,",
    "the frdm@xcite predicts very large deformations @xmath126 . in order not to miss such large - deformation solutions ,",
    "we have done additional searches for all the nuclei in this region , in which we continue to exert the quadrupole potential until @xmath97 becomes @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) before starting the free evolution for the prolate ( oblate ) solution .",
    "these additional searches indeed produced large - deformation solutions .",
    "however , none of them are the ground states unlike in the results of the frdm .    in shape - transitional nuclei ,",
    "the pes often has more than three normal - deformation minima .",
    "however , they are usually very shallow and it is doubtful that each of them corresponds to a distinct eigenstate notwithstanding the quantum fluctuation in shape .",
    "therefore , we do not manage to find out all of these shallow minima .      as we have discussed in section  [ s_basis ] , it is necessary to correct the total energy for the inaccuracy due to the finite mesh size because its relative error has to be by far smaller than that of other quantities for the sake of comparison with experimental data .    to evaluate the size of the error",
    ", one needs the hf+bcs solution for vanishingly small mesh size .",
    "it can be obtained without difficulty concerning spherical solutions , because even personal computers can execute spherical hf+bcs codes with very small radial - grid spacing .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to compare the total energies between the solutions of a spherical hf+bcs code ( the _ skhafo _ taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the cartesian - mesh code _ ev8 _ with constraints of vanishing quadrupole moments . in the following ,",
    "we designate the total energy obtained with the spherical code as @xmath129 while that from the cartesian - mesh code simply as @xmath130 .",
    "our aim is to construct a formula for the energy correction so that the corrected energy @xmath131(correction ) has a much smaller r.m.s .",
    "deviation from @xmath129 than @xmath130 has .    in the least - square fitting to determine the parameters of the formula , we have used 1005 nuclei ( among the 1029 nuclei ) whose paring gaps ( both for proton and neutron ) coincide within 0.1 mev between the results of the two codes . with the simplest fitting function of @xmath132 = @xmath130 + @xmath133 , the r.m.s .",
