    "recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) show a flat portion at low multipole number @xmath1 and a sharp peak around @xmath2 , as well as tentative evidence for a peak structure beyond @xmath3 .",
    "this represents a tremendous success for the simplest models of the universe described by a flat friedmann ",
    "walker metric with adiabatic perturbations , which are in excellent qualitative agreement with these observations .",
    "the power of the cmb is that it can be used to constrain cosmological parameters , as well as allowing us to test our assumptions about the form of the initial irregularities in qualitative and now quantitative ways .",
    "the most popular assumption concerning the initial irregularities is that they originated during a period of cosmological inflation ( see liddle & lyth 2000 for an extensive account of inflationary cosmology ) .",
    "there have now been several papers which have searched for possible effects in this data from quite complicated inflationary models .",
    "one example is the inclusion of extra isocurvature degrees of freedom in the primordial power spectrum in addition to a dominant adiabatic component ( trotta , riazuelo & durrer 2001 ; amendola et al .",
    "2002 ) , with the conclusion that the current data set is consistent with a sub - dominant isocurvature component ( or even a dominant one on large scales in the case where the isocurvature perturbations are correlated with the adiabatic ones ) and that the allowed values and ranges of the cosmological parameters are sensitive to the type of perturbations under consideration .",
    "another example is attempts to fit inflation - motivated ` features in the power spectrum ' to the data ( griffiths , silk & zaroubi 2001 ; barriga et al .",
    "2001 ; adams , cresswell & easther 2001 ) .",
    "these scalar power spectra have the intrinsic property of introducing extra degrees of freedom  the shape parameters associated with the feature  which can be used alter the peak heights at will .",
    "however it is necessary to choose the features to coincide with characteristic scales in the cmb power spectrum , such as the first or second peaks [ early work in this direction ( adams , ross & sarkar 1997 ) was also motivated by possible features in the matter power spectrum ] .",
    "the cmb spectrum alone offers no evidence for any extra features and so smooth power spectra are currently best motivated .",
    "it is surprising that relatively little attention has been paid to the cmb spectrum resulting from slow - roll inflation , even though these models have been the most intensively studied since its conception .",
    "slow - roll inflation has acted as a guiding principle for inflation model builders , and is the simplest assumption and capable of giving excellent agreement with observations .",
    "the reason why specific studies of slow - roll inflation have been lacking is the usual assumption that inflation predicts a nearly power - law shaped spectrum , and hence that any information about inflation can be extracted as some linear combination of the constraints on the two key parameters , the scalar spectral index @xmath4 , and the tensor fraction @xmath5 , an approach used by kinney , melchiorri & riotto ( 2001 ) and by hannestad et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to discuss constraints on inflation .",
    "hansen & kunz ( 2001 ) also included the running of the spectral index , translating constraints on these parameters to place bounds on derivatives of the inflaton potential .",
    "other parameter analyses ( wang , tegmark & zaldarriaga 2002 ; percival et al .",
    "2002 ) have tended to focus on results for other cosmological parameters such as the densities of the various matter components , and have been content to use this simple parametrization .",
    "however , this approach ignores the fact that current data are only weakly constraining , and the current data set permits parameter regions where a significant deviation from a harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum is allowed , and where the use of the full slow - roll power spectra is required to obtain robust results .",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to make the first direct estimation of slow - roll inflation parameters from cmb data .",
    "while the full predictions are relevant only in extreme regions of parameter space given current data , as the global cosmological data set improves ( and in particular as significant observational weight develops on the high @xmath1 part of the cmb spectrum ) it may well be that these types of corrections take on increasing importance , depending which ( if any ) inflation models prove capable of fitting the data .",
    "we do not expect any dramatic new results from this analysis given the quality of present data , though it is a useful test of the robustness of results under more general forms of the initial power spectra .",
    "however it is an important test of principle to bring these methods to bear on cosmological parameter estimation , as the high - quality data of coming years may well require the high - accuracy description of the power spectrum that this approach allows .",
    "in order to implement the inflationary cosmology into a parameter search method , we need an adequate parametrization of the scalar and tensor power spectra that give rise to the observed anisotropies .",
    "we use the recently introduced horizon - flow parameters ( schwarz , terrero - escalante & garcia 2001 ) which are based around the hubble parameter during inflation and its derivatives .",
    "these parameters enter directly into both the friedmann equation and into the mode equations for scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "they often simplify the results from analytical calculations of the power spectrum because of their simple definition @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hubble parameter at some chosen time and @xmath8 is the number of @xmath9-foldings of inflation .",
    "more importantly from the observational side , this formalism provides a consistent and detailed description of the shapes of the scalar and tensor power spectra as well as their absolute and relative normalizations , independent of other cosmological parameters ( such as the cosmological constant physical density @xmath10 ) .",
    "our inflationary parameter set consists of the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , evaluated at some particular time during inflation . as the amplitude of inflationary perturbations is primarily determined around horizon crossing",
    ", we can relate time to scale by asking when a given scale equalled the hubble radius during inflation , @xmath15 , and we can then think of these parameters as a function of scale .",
    "the scale at which they will be evaluated is in a sense arbitrary but is of course most wisely chosen to be around the centre of the scales actually probed by the observations .",
    "this parameter set replaces that made up of astrophysical quantities @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 that are used if the power spectra are taken as the starting point .",
    "here @xmath22 is the amplitude of scalar perturbations specified at the scale @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the ratio of the tensor and scalar @xmath25 curves evaluated at @xmath26 , and @xmath27 and @xmath20 are the slopes of the initial scalar and tensor power - law spectra .",
    "use of the inflationary parameters automatically enforces the inflationary consistency relations between scalar and tensor perturbations , and so there are fewer parameters to be fit ; a full treatment of observations would also test these conditions though present data is not good enough for a meaningful confirmation .",
    "the current data set has very limited abilities to constrain tensor perturbations and usually only @xmath5 is used to describe them ( perhaps coupled with a consistency relation to fix the tensor spectral index ) .",
    "it is also common , though not universal , for parameter searches to neglect scale - dependence of the scalar spectral index .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath28 from slow - roll inflation can be obtained as an expansion of the power spectrum ( or some function of the power spectrum ) in terms of the logarithmic wavenumber . while the usual power - law expression is mostly simply related to an expansion of @xmath29 , since it is the power spectrum itself which is constrained by observations it is most direct to expand @xmath30 itself ( martin , riazuelo & schwarz 2000 ; leach et al .",
    "the spectra of curvature perturbations @xmath31 and of tensor perturbations @xmath32 are written as @xmath33 the detailed predictions for the @xmath34 have been calculated to second order in the slow - roll parameters ( stewart & gong 2001 ; leach et al .  2002 ) to be @xmath35 for the scalars , and @xmath36 for the tensors , where @xmath37 is a numerical constant .",
    "the full parametrization of inflation as given here , where we truncate at @xmath38 , should remain sufficiently accurate for some time to come , quite likely including _ planck _ satellite results .    concerning the relative normalization of tensor and scalars , the constant of proportionality for eq .",
    "( [ eqn : chaotic ] ) is given by the slow - roll amplitudes @xmath39 in the slow - roll limit the tensor to scalar ratio is given by @xmath40 , and the more general expression can be read from the above expansion coefficients as @xmath41 \\,.\\ ] ]    this logarithmic expansion of the power spectra is accurate over a wide range of the inflationary parameter space .",
    "however , unlike the expansion of @xmath42 ( the power - law expansion ) , the logarithmic expansion of @xmath43 can become negative at large @xmath44 for large @xmath45 .",
    "this pathological behaviour serves as a warning against using either expansion alone for robustly extracting any inflationary signal in this regime without cross - checks . in any case",
    ", this is behaviour does not occur in our analysis due to the limited range of scales currently probed by the cmb .",
    "the methods that we describe in this paper therefore complement the traditional approach , and a careful analysis should utilize both ( leach et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "to lowest order in slow - roll these predictions reduce to the well - known linearized form @xmath46 written is this way it is clear that an observational strategy would ideally use information from the tensor sector ( primarily the tensor amplitude ) to break the degeneracy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the scalar spectral index .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath12 is to boost the large - angle anisotropies via the tensor amplitude while simultaneously tilting downwards the small - angle anisotropies via the scalar tilt , which act roughly constructively .    in slow - roll inflation",

    "we examine a set of spatially - flat cosmologies using the parameters @xmath69 where @xmath70 measures the physical matter density and @xmath71 is the optical depth to the last - scattering surface .",

    "it is worth emphasising that we have included @xmath80 as a full parameter instead of using an analytic procedure to choose the best amplitude from the data and each model .",
    "apart from our obvious interest in primordial physics , @xmath81 is a parameter that will be determined with high accuracy in the future and so should be included in the analysis .",
    "the dependence of the power spectrum on the third slow - roll parameter @xmath38 is very weak , given the current data set , and so we fix @xmath82 while still using the second - order expressions , which give a better representation of the power spectrum at large @xmath83 and @xmath44 than the first - order expressions .",
    "our decision to truncate the slow - roll expansion after @xmath13 is based on subtle considerations .",
    "as the series expansion is an infinite one , it clearly has to be truncated somewhere ; if we did include @xmath38 the same question of whether to include or not would then arise for @xmath84 .",
    "we believe that a suitable criterion is that one ought not to include parameters which the data can not distinguish from zero , i.e.  we impose a null hypothesis that those parameters are zero .",
    "while that criterion is driven by data alone , it makes sense in the context of inflation because one does expect the parameters to be small , and if the data is unable to constrain them to be small , then the parameter space explored would include models which would not be satisfactory inflation models .",
    "unfortunately this criterion can not be rigidly applied , as even @xmath12 and @xmath13 can not presently be distinguished from zero ; thirty years of large - scale structure studies have not excluded the harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum .",
    "however if inflation is to be meaningfully tested , eventually at least one of these parameters needs to be detected with a non - zero value and so we do include them in our current treatment .",
    "this is appropriate as inflation models do predict values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 comparable to constraints from present data .",
    "by contrast , typical inflation models predict @xmath38 to be much smaller than the present limits from data ( see e.g.  hansen & kunz 2001 ) .",
    "whether experiments such as _ planck _ can detect a non - zero @xmath38 remains to be seen .",
    "we fix the pivot point to @xmath85mpc@xmath86 , ignoring the cosmological dependence , proportional to @xmath87 , of the range of scales probed by the cmb .",
    "the hubble parameter is an auxiliary parameter given by @xmath88 throughout this paper we examine the effect of applying the hst hubble parameter prior of @xmath89 at 1@xmath90 , which acts as a constraint on the total physical matter density for our flat cosmologies .     +    when presenting parameter constraints , we simply minimize the @xmath48 over unwanted parameters . in principle",
    "one should consider performing a cubic spline over the @xmath48 of our coarse grid of models in order to examine the shape of the likelihood function @xmath91 and to subsequently perform a marginalization procedure ( efstathiou et al .",
    "however , minimizing the @xmath48 reproduces the basic shape of the allowed region in parameter space ( tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 ) .",
    "our best - fit model has @xmath92 and so we plot the 2@xmath90 and 3@xmath90 contours for a @xmath48 distribution with 51.1 degrees of freedom . we omit the 1@xmath90 contour , as little useful information is conveyed by this level of certainty in the context of cmb parameter searches .",
    "we regard the models enclosed by the 2@xmath90 contours as representing good fits to the data , and the 3@xmath90 contours mark out the region where tension between the data and the models begins .    turning firstly to three of the standard cosmological parameters , the densities of the three main components , we see in fig .",

    "for the current dataset we observe a weak correlation between the constraints on @xmath95 and @xmath10 .",
    "the main effect of applying a prior on the hubble parameter , @xmath96 , is to rule out models with a large physical density in @xmath10 , and to close the contours near @xmath97 .",

    "including @xmath98 as a full parameter in the analysis acts as a useful warning against including higher - order parameters in the power spectrum ; until we have pinned down the amplitude of perturbations at some given scale , there is little sense in trying to measure the higher derivatives of the power spectrum such as the running of the spectral index etc , under the assumption that these higher derivatives are weak .",
    "reading off the 2-@xmath90 bounds on @xmath100 and @xmath12 we find @xmath101 these are the main results of this paper , and are in good agreement with the analysis of lewis & bridle ( 2002 ) .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath12 is consistent with the inflationary hypothesis , which requires @xmath102 for inflation to occur .",
    "it is nt possible push this limit much further down using cmb data from ground and balloon observations due to the calibration uncertainties in the high @xmath1 region which mask the primary effect of @xmath12 , which is to boost the low @xmath103s relative to the high @xmath103s .",

( [ eqn : chaotic ] ) , for the first time . although the present data set can not hope to actually measure the weak running of the spectral index induced by a significant tensor component , we derived sensible limits on the power spectrum amplitude @xmath116 and the first two parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , by assuming the running to be weak , which was achieved by considering models with @xmath117 , @xmath78 ( and fixing @xmath82 ) .",

    "as the global dataset improves , including map and then _ planck _ data , it is quite likely that these techniques are required to ensure robust estimation even of cosmological parameters such as the densities of the various components .",
