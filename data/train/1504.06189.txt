    "although the foundations of quantum and classical physics are much different , it is often difficult to construct a simple criterion of non - classicality of a particular system .",
    "a prominent example of a quantum phenomenon is the ability of particles to exist in superpositions of states .",
    "the most well known manifestation of such superposition is the young double - slit experiment for massive particles , which confirms their wave character and the ability to coherently interfere .",
    "a more subtle example of genuinely quantum phenomenon is the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox @xcite , which was introduced using a pair of entangled particles , separated far apart .",
    "a consequence of quantum mechanics is that a measurement of some physical quantity of one of the particles affects the other at an instant .",
    "this has no classical counterpart , as shown by john bell @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the bell inequalities , tested in many experiments @xcite , are analyzed in the context of the entanglement @xcite .",

    "the definition of an entangled state is discriminative .",
    "namely , it is based on the definition of the separable ( non - entangled ) states as being a mixture of product states of @xmath0 particles @xcite , i.e. , @xmath1 here @xmath2 s are non - negative weights that add up to unity . entangled",
    "are all those states which can not be represented in the form ( [ sep ] ) .",
    "a consequence of this indirect definition is that it is usually not straightforward to construct a criterion or a measure of particle entanglement .",
    "usually , one must find some physically measurable quantity @xmath3 , which for separable states is bounded ( from above or below ) by a critical value @xmath4 .",
    "if some state gives the value of @xmath3 , which breaks this bound , then @xmath3 is a criterion for particle entanglement .",
    "trivially , such criterion detects entanglement of only those states , which break the bound , therefore most @xmath3 s are not universal .",
    "quantum interferometry provides a good example of such criterion .",

    ", a phase @xmath6 is imprinted between the modes .",
    "if the phase is estimated in a series of @xmath7 experiments , the precision of the estimation is limited by the cramr - rao lower bound @xcite : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the quantum fisher information , which depends on @xmath5 and the type of applied interferometer @xcite . for all separable two - mode states",

    "the useful particle entanglement has been achieved by means of two - body interactions present in ultra - cold systems .",

    "this statement can be quantified if the density matrix of the electromagnetic field is expressed using the p - representation @xcite @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is a ( possibly multi - mode ) coherent state of light , defined by the relation @xmath15 the operator @xmath16 implies the positive - frequency part of the electromagnetic field @xmath17 , while the symbol @xmath18 in eq .",

    "at this point , we formulate a criterion for the separability of a system of @xmath0 bosons , based on their second - order correlation function .",

    "<S> basing on the analogy between the coherent states of light and separable states of @xmath0 bosons , we demonstrate that the violation cauchy - schwarz inequality for any - order correlation function signals the entanglement among the constituent particles . rather than restricting to the correlations between the positions of particles , we consider the broadest set of measurements allowed by quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> our result is general  it applies to any quantum system of bosons , even when the number of particles is not fixed , provided that there is no coherence between different number states . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the compact expression for the separable state of bosons can be used to relate some known metrological quantities to the particle entanglement in a very simple way . </S>"
