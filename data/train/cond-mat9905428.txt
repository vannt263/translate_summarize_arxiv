    "the anomalous normal state transport properties of high-@xmath0 superconductors have attracted much attention for a decade . for a wide temperature ( @xmath1 ) range the electrical resistivity shows @xmath1-linear behavior in the optimally doped and under - doped compounds .",
    "this behavior is understood as a result of the presence of a second energy scale well below the fermi energy .",
    "such an energy scale is related@xcite to strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations which develop due to the large antiferromagnetic coupling between nearest neighbor cu spins via the superexchange mechanism .",
    "furthermore the electrical resistivity of samples in a over - doping region shows a gradual change from @xmath1-linear behavior to @xmath2-behavior@xcite , and the metallic properties in the over - doping limit recover conventional behavior of a fermi liquid .    in the present paper",
    "our main concern is the hall coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "it is usually related to charge carrier density @xmath4 as @xmath5 , and its sign to carrier type ( electron- or hole - like ) in conventional metals and semiconductors .",
    "if the anisotropy in transport relaxation time @xmath6 is neglected , conductivity and hall conductivity are proportional to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "then hall coefficient @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath6 , and shows no significant temperature dependence .",
    "however if transport relaxation time is dependent on temperature differently from point to point on the fermi surface , the hall coefficient can depend on temperature . in the normal state of hole - doped cuprate superconductors@xcite ,",
    "the sign of the hall coefficient is positive , and the hall coefficient decreases as the temperature increases for a wide temperature range .",
    "hole - like character of the fermi surface has been observed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments@xcite . moreover in samples with lower doping rate the absolute value of the hall coefficient is larger and the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient is stronger .",
    "the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient has been recently recognized@xcite to be due to the strongly anisotropic scattering of quasiparticles from antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "however it also has been pointed out that the temperature dependence of the anisotropy in the quasiparticle damping is insufficient to account fully for the hall coefficient .",
    "temperature dependence of the hall angle @xmath9 also has attracted attention@xcite .",
    "if transport relaxation time @xmath6 is isotropic , @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath11 and therefore should show similar temperature dependence as that of resistivity .",
    "however in high-@xmath0 cuprates @xmath12 shows nearly @xmath2-behavior rather than the @xmath1-linear behavior of the resistivity .",
    "this fact also indicate the existence of anisotropy in the transport relaxation time .    in this paper we consider the electrical conductivity and the hall conductivity on the basis of the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( nafl ) model taking account of the vertex correction to the current vertex arising from interactions between quasiparticles .",
    "study based on the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation@xcite is reported elsewhere@xcite .",
    "incidentally , miyake and narikiyo@xcite has developed a theory , which is supposed to explain the anomalous behavior of the hall coefficient , on the basis of some kind of spin fluctuation theory but from different viewpoint than ours .",
    "the nafl model@xcite has been used to calculate the superconducting transition temperature on the basis of the eliashberg formalism@xcite , and to describe magnetic and transport properties@xcite in the normal state . in this model",
    "the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are provided by giving the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath13 , which is required to provide a quantitative fit to nmr or other magnetic experiments . since the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath14 peaks at the wave vector @xmath15 on the simple square lattice ( the lattice constant is set to be unity ) , quasiparticles located close to those momentum points on the fermi surface which are connected to another point on the fermi surface by @xmath16 have much larger damping rate than that of quasiparticles away from those momentum points , and therefore are said@xcite to be `` hot '' in the literature .",
    "this distinct difference in quasiparticle lifetimes on the fermi surface leads to the anomalous behavior of the hall coefficient .",
    "we base our calculation of conductivities on the formalism developed by eliashberg@xcite , which was applied to hall conductivity by fukuyama , ebisawa and wada@xcite , and by kohno and yamada@xcite .",
    "eliashberg derived a general formula for conductivity on the basis of the fermi liquid theory starting from the finite - temperature current - current correlation function , namely the kubo formula .",
    "his formula is exact as far as the most singular term with respect to the quasiparticle damping rate is concerned ; in applying to strongly correlated metals it is on firmer theoretical grounds than is a transport theory which makes use of the boltzmann equation@xcite .",
    "we show that by the vertex correction the current vertex is transformed to a large extent from the quasiparticle velocity in the presence of highly anisotropic scattering coming from strong antiferromagnetic spin correlations . as a result",
    "the hall coefficient can be much larger at low temperatures than the estimate made without the vertex correction .",
    "both the smearing of the fermi and bose distribution and the temperature dependence of the spin correlations cause the unusual temperature dependence of the hall coefficient .    in an electron - doped cuprate nd@xmath17ce@xmath18cuo@xmath19 , the normal state hall coefficient has been reported@xcite to be negative , although there seems to remain some controversy in experimental situation@xcite .",
    "this negative sign is difficult to understand in the framework of quasiparticle transport without taking into account the vertex correction to the current vertex , since with electron - doping the fermi surface is expected to remain hole - like .",
    "the hole - like character of the fermi surface is predicted@xcite by band structure calculations , and is seen@xcite in arpes experiments . in the present paper",
    "we show that hall coefficient can be negative due to strong backward scattering between quasiparticles , even if the curvature of the fermi surface is everywhere hole - like .    in  2",
    "we describe expressions of conductivities which was derived on the basis of the fermi liquid theory . in ",
    "3 the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid model is described , and the expression of vertex corrections to the current vertex is given . in ",
    "4 numerical results are shown for the transport current , the resistivity and the hall coefficient .",
    "conclusion and some discussions are given in  5 . in the present paper",
    "we consider only the transport properties in the cuo@xmath20-plane , although out - of - plane transport phenomena also have attracted intense interest@xcite .",
    "a formula for electrical conductivity in interacting electron systems was given by eliashberg@xcite on the basis of the fermi liquid theory .",
    "it is exact as far as the term singular with respect to quasiparticle damping is concerned .",
    "the result is given by@xcite @xmath21 here the factor two is from the spin degeneracy , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the velocity , energy and damping rate of a quasiparticle of momentum @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the fermi distribution function .",

    "this imaginary quantity is related to the imaginary part of selfenergy , and only by treating the correction from this term in a manner that preserves the conservation laws we can obtain the correct result for the resistivity arising from electron - electron interactions@xcite , i.e. the resistivity vanishes without umklapp processes .    a general expression for hall conductivity in interacting electron systems",
    "was obtained by kohno and yamada@xcite following an earlier work by fukuyama , ebisawa and wada@xcite .",
    "it is exact as far as the most singular @xmath45-term is concerned , i.e. it gives the main contribution in the fermi liquid .",

    "note that the charge of carriers is such as @xmath48 in the electron- ( hole- ) picture . in the first expression it is assumed that @xmath49- and @xmath50- directions are equivalent . in the second expression the momentum integration variables in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the magnetic field ( assumed to be in the @xmath51-direction ) are changed@xcite from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is tangential to the curve of intersection of a constant energy surface with a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field and @xmath55 is perpendicular to a constant energy curve in the plane .",
    "( [ hallc ] ) is valid as far as the @xmath56-term can be neglected in comparison with the @xmath45-term . in the present paper",
    "we neglect the @xmath56-term , although it can be shown that there really are diagrams which contribute to the @xmath56-term@xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that interband effects are neglected .",
    "if we approximate the last factor in the integrand of ( [ hallc ] ) as @xmath57 , where the chemical potential for quasiparticles is set to be zero , then integration over @xmath55 cancels with the factor @xmath58 and hall conductivity is reduced to the form @xmath59 where the integration is over the fermi surface .",
    "therefore hall conductivity is given by an integration over @xmath60 of the area swept out by @xmath61 weighted by a factor proportional to the square of unrenormalized lifetime of quasiparticles .",
    "moreover if we assume free - electron dispersion , i.e. @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , then we obtain the well known drude formulae : @xmath65 and @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath66 is a constant independent of @xmath25 , @xmath4 is the charge carrier density @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the fermi momentum ) , and @xmath69 is the transport relaxation time . as discussed by yamada and yosida@xcite , @xmath66 is divergent and resistivity vanishes if we consider only electron - electron interactions and do not take umklapp processes into account .",
    "in an anisotropic system on a lattice with a large fermi surface , the vertex correction arising from quasiparticle interaction ( [ vc1 ] ) can not be reduced to a momentum independent factor @xmath66 like that introduced in the last paragraph under the assumption of isotropy , and @xmath70 is not in the same direction of @xmath71 , except when the momentum is at symmetric points or at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "therefore the effect of this vertex correction remains to be reflected in hall coefficient , while the factor @xmath66 and quasiparticle damping @xmath72 cancel out in hall coefficient in free - electron - like isotropic approximation .    in the expressions for conductivities , @xmath37 , @xmath73 and @xmath24 are renormalized by @xmath31 , and the density of states of quasiparticles @xmath57 is enhanced by @xmath74 .",
    "therefore all renormalizations cancel with each other .",
    "this cancellation applies also to @xmath33-sections given by ( [ g2 ] ) , which appear in the expressions for the vertex correction to the current vertex .",

    "the temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic spin correlation length also is important in bringing about strong temperature dependence of the hall coefficient ; as temperature increases and the spin correlation length gets shorter , enhancement of the transport current is reduced . in the scheme ( iv ) , in a narrow low temperature region , effect of the vertex correction gets stronger as temperature increases , and then decrease of the hall coefficient with increasing temperature is restrained at low temperatures .    in figs .",

    "[ hallc_imp ] for the following reason , as long as a system remains normal in a temperature regime where residual impurity scattering dominates .",
    "when @xmath174 at low temperatures the vertex correction arising from interactions between quasiparticles is negligible , since there is a factor proportional to @xmath2 arising from the discontinuity of the vertex function in complex energy plane .",

    "however the hall conductivity can be negative in our treatment , since the greater part of the fermi surface in the first brillouin zone is outside of the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone , and therefore makes a dominantly negative contribution to the hall conductivity .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ hallce ] an example of temperature dependence of the hall coefficient in electron - doped systems . here",
    "@xmath120 ev , @xmath124 , @xmath179 ev and @xmath180 , with @xmath133 twice as large as that used previously for a hole - doped system .",
    "the fermi surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] as the case ( c ) .",
    "it has been pointed out in the literature that the remarkable temperature dependence of the hall coefficient in the normal state of the high-@xmath0 cuprates is due to highly anisotropic scattering of the quasiparticles in the presence of strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "there is much difference in the damping rate of the quasiparticles on the fermi surface , according to whether a quasiparticle is located near the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone boundary or not .",
    "however the temperature dependence of the anisotropy in the quasiparticle damping is not sufficient to account fully for the hall coefficient .    in the present paper",
    "we have furthermore taken account of the vertex correction to the current vertex arising from interactions between the quasiparticles .",
    "we have given a phenomenological expression for the dynamical spin susceptibility to describe interactions between the quasiparticles .",
    "in the presence of strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , the current vertex is considerably transformed from the quasiparticle velocity by the vertex correction , and is enhanced at most points on the fermi surface . as a consequence",
    "a part of the fermi surface outside of the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone makes negative contribution to the hall conductivity , even if the curvature of the fermi surface is everywhere hole - like . if due regard is taken to the vertex correction to the current vertex , the hall coefficient is much enhanced at low temperatures .",
    "temperature dependence of anisotropy in the quasiparticle damping rate and of the spin correlation length lead to significant temperature dependence of the hall coefficient . in our treatment",
    "the hall conductivity can be negative in electron - doped systems , even if the fermi surface is hole - like .",
    "a single fermi surface can make both positive and negative contributions to the hall conductivity , and then a sign change of the hall coefficient with a variation of temperature can occur . generally speaking ,",
    "sign of hall coefficient can not be determined only by curvature of the fermi surface in systems with highly anisotropic scattering .",
    "we have adopted a form for the dynamical spin susceptibility which has large weight only on the antiferromagnetic spin correlations and is not good at accounting for the long wavelength component of dynamical spin susceptibility@xcite . therefore in our approximation scheme for evaluation of the transport current , the effect of anisotropic scatterings on the vertex correction may be overestimated .",
    "in actuality the integral equation for the vertex correction no longer converges with the antiferromagnetic correlation length @xmath88 as large as 5 measured in units of the lattice constant . as was discussed below eq .",
    "( [ vc22 ] ) , a large @xmath88 restricts regions which make significant contribution to the integral equation to those near the `` hot spots '' , and each `` hot spot '' is coupled to another proportionally to @xmath181 .",
    "then the transport current is very much different from the quasiparticle velocity , and the integral equation converges slowly .",
    "our evaluation of the transport current is sensitive to shape of the fermi surface , especially to position of the `` hot spots '' as intersection points of the fermi surface with the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone boundary .",
    "the `` hot spots '' are strongly coupled with each other , and around the `` hot spots '' the fermi surface is divided into two parts , one of which contribute positively and the other of which negatively to the hall conductivity . in the present paper",
    "we have regarded the fermi surface for the quasiparticles as to be given , and have not selfconsistently determined the fermi surface in the presence of interactions .",
    "yanase and yamada@xcite and the present authors@xcite have pointed out the importance of transformation of the fermi surface due to electron - electron interactions ; the strong antiferromagnetic spin correlation leads to a shape more suitable for nesting and with less curvature . from this",
    "transformation results a wider range of @xmath1-linear resistivity .    in our calculation",
    "if we take the ratio @xmath182 larger , the ratio of the absolute value of the quasiparticle velocity at the `` hot spots '' to that at the `` cold spots '' ( where @xmath183 ) becomes larger . then effect of the vertex correction gets stronger and the conductivity as well as the hall conductivity becomes enhanced . as a result the enhancement of the hall coefficient is suppressed .",
    "therefore , in our treatment , less curvature of the fermi surface leads to more enhancement of the hall coefficient .",
    "this tendency is likely to be strengthened , if shape of the fermi surface is incorporated to determine characteristics of spin fluctuations .",
    "the contrary is expected with no regard to the vertex correction to the current vertex .",
    "it has been reported@xcite that , with some generality but being not always the case , the hall coefficient decreases as the temperature decreases in a low temperature region .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that isotropic impurity scattering leads to a downturn of the hall coefficient at low temperatures .",
    "on the other hand yanase and yamada@xcite attributed such decrease of the hall coefficient at low temperatures to consequent decrease of the antiferromagnetic spin correlation length upon the opening of the pseudogap and development of correlations favoring spin singlet states .",
    "moreover there exists an intimate relationship@xcite between the pseudogap phenomena and the transport properties , e.g. the onset temperature of the pseudogap @xmath184 is closely related to the beginning of the downward deviation of the in - plane resistivity from a @xmath1-linear behavior .",
    "therefore the downturn of the hall coefficient at low temperatures may be mainly due to the opening of the pseudogap .",
    "also in our theory a decrease of the antiferromagnetic spin correlation length leads to a reduction of the hall coefficient at low temperatures .    in a paper@xcite in association with the present one , an analysis based on the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation is given .",
    "the flex is a kind of conserving approximation in the sense of baym and kadanoff@xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "characters of spin fluctuations for some representative compounds are reproduced . with the use of results of the selfconsistent calculations ,",
    "the conductivity and hall conductivity are calculated in a manner which preserves the conservation laws .",
    "temperature dependence of the fermi surface is predicted , and this effect leads to an temperature dependence of the hall coefficient inconsistent with experiments , if the vertex correction to the current vertex is neglected .",
    "it is shown that the characteristic temperature dependence and the enhancement of the hall coefficient are reproducible only by taking account of the vertex correction to the current vertex .",
    "lastly we point out that our idea may also account for similar behavior in transport phenomena of other systems with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , for example heavy fermion compounds and organic conductors such as bedt - ttf salts .",
    "to cite a few recent experiments , strong temperature dependence of the hall coefficient was reported@xcite for a ladder compound sr@xmath185ca@xmath18cu@xmath186o@xmath187 ; similarity in transport properties with the high-@xmath0 cuprate is discussed for a correlated metal v@xmath188o@xmath127@xcite .",
