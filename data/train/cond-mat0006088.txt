    "the trapping and guiding of atoms has been the subject of a number of experimental and theoretical works during the last few years.@xcite among the various methods that have been applied to the trapping of atoms , the magnetic one has been clearly recognized as the most powerful.@xcite the possibility of exciton trapping in semiconductors has been actively pursued for many years.@xcite recently , nonhomogeneous stress was used in order to create an energy minimum for the trapping of excitons in gaas quantum wells.@xcite several works have argued that the utilization of homogeneous magnetic fields during the trapping of excitons in semiconductors quantum wells will enhance bose - einstein effects in a gas of excitons.@xcite in particular , ref . [ 9 ] reported a strong increase of the exciton confinement properties above a critical threshold of uniform magnetic field . an alternative approach to localize excitons is by using nonhomogeneous magnetic fields .",

    "several magnetic structures which can be used for the trapping of particles have been proposed,@xcite such as : magnetic quantum dots produced by a scanning tunneling microscope lithographic technique,@xcite magnetic superlattices created through the patterning of ferromagnetic materials integrated with semiconductors,@xcite type - ii superconducting materials deposited on conventional heterostructures,@xcite and nonplanar 2deg systems grown by molecular - beam epitaxy.@xcite in particular , a magnetic dipole type of profile , which experimentally can be created by ferromagnetic materials deposited on top of semiconductor heterostructures , has attracted a great deal of interest.@xcite this system is essentially different from the others since the local nonhomogeneous magnetic field has zero average magnetic field strength .",

    "<S> the trapping of excitons in a semiconductor quantum well due to a circular symmetric nonhomogeneous magnetic field is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the spin state of the exciton on its trapping energy is analyzed , and the importance of the interaction of the orbital and spin zeeman effect as compared to the diamagnetic term in the exciton hamiltonian is emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic field profiles are considered , which can experimentally be created through the deposition of ferromagnetic disks on top of a semiconductor heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> this setup gives rise to a magnetic dipole type of profile in the @xmath0 plane of the exciton motion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spin direction of the exciton influences its localization by changing the confinement region in the effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton confinement increases with magnetic field intensity , and this is more pronounced when the exciton g - factor is different from zero . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical calculations are performed for gaas / al@xmath1ga@xmath2as quantum wells and we show that it open up a new realistic path for experiments designed to probe exciton trapping in semiconductors . </S>"
