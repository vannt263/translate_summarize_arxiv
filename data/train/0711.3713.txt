    "in the study of inflationary cosmology , it is often assumed that a classical inflaton field @xmath0 obeys a local equation of motion of the form @xmath1 where the friction term @xmath2 accounts for the loss of inflaton energy by radiation of particles .",
    "( we omit the usual hubble damping term @xmath3 , for reasons discussed below . )",
    "in particular , `` warm inflation '' scenarios ( see , for example , @xcite ) envisage a friction coefficient @xmath4 large enough for the inflaton motion to be perpetually overdamped , thus avoiding the usual process of reheating .",
    "however , an equation of this form does not arise automatically from quantum field theory .",
    "indeed , if the inflaton couples biquadratically to scalar fields @xmath5 , and via yukawa interactions to spin-@xmath6 fields @xmath7 , its equation of motion is generically of the form @xmath8 where the expectation values @xmath9 and @xmath10 are nonlocal functionals of @xmath0 .",
    "that is , they depend on the entire history of @xmath0 , at all times prior to the time @xmath11 at which the expectation values are evaluated .",
    "the issue we address here is whether these expectation values can be adequately approximated by a local friction term , together with a local correction to the effective potential @xmath12 , leading to the equation of motion ( [ localeom ] ) . to focus on this issue , which is substantially independent of the background metric",
    ", we simplify matters throughout by studying quantum field theory in minkowski spacetime , with @xmath13 .",
    "if the motion of @xmath0 is slow enough , it seems intuitively reasonable that suitable approximations to these expectation values can be obtained by considering the linear response of a state of thermal equilibrium to a time - dependent perturbation , @xmath14 .",
    "several implementations of this general idea can be found in the literature ( see , for example @xcite ) , and lead to well - defined estimates of the friction coefficient @xmath4 . however , the _ assumption _ that this problem can adequately be treated on the basis of linear perturbations about _ equilibrium _ thermal field theory deserves further investigation .",
    "if this assumption is valid , then the results should be reproduced in the slow evolution limit of _ nonequilibrium _ field theory .    for the case of an inflaton coupled to a scalar field , this does not seem to be true @xcite .",
    "formally , one can derive approximate , local nonequilibrium evolution equations , but a time - derivative expansion of the solution to these equations , which is needed to arrive at ( [ localeom ] ) , does not exist . with the further approximation of replacing non - equilibrium self - energies with their equilibrium counterparts , a time - derivative expansion becomes possible , leading to what we call",
    "the _ adiabatic approximation _ , which essentially reproduces the results of linear response theory .",
    "however , numerical investigation shows that the motion generated by the nonequilibrium equations is not well approximated by the adiabatic approximation",
    ".    these results might well be specific to the particular field theory considered . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this to some extent by extending the analysis of @xcite to the case of an inflaton that decays into spin-@xmath6 fermions . in principle , the calculations are quite similar , but the technicalities associated with spin-@xmath6 fields are slightly more complicated .    in section [ freefer ] we derive exact evolution equations for the number densities @xmath15 , and auxiliary functions @xmath16 , which together specify the nonequilibrium state of fermions that are free , except for a @xmath0-dependent mass arising from a yukawa coupling to the classical inflaton .",
    "these are the fermionic analogues of the exact equations derived for scalar fields by morikawa and sasaki @xcite . as in the scalar - field case",
    ", they do not describe any significant frictional effect , because particles radiated by the inflaton motion can easily be reabsorbed . to achieve a permanent transfer of energy from the inflaton to the system of particles",
    ", these particles must interact with each other , and dissipate energy by scattering .",
    "an approximate set of nonequilibrium evolution equations is obtained in section [ interactions ] , by adapting the analysis described by lawrie and mckernan in @xcite .",
    "the closed - time - path methods used to develop this approximation are very different from the straightforward ( if long - winded ) operator methods available for free field theories , and the fact that the equations of section [ freefer ] are recovered in the free - field limit is a crucial check on this method of approximation .",
    "we again find that the nonequilibrium evolution equations do not admit a solution in the form of a time - derivative expansion ( in fact , this seems to be a general , model - independent result ) , but an adiabatic approximation can be devised , as explained in section [ adiabatic ] .",
    "numerical solutions to the nonequilibrium evolution equations , and to the adiabatic approximation to these equations , are described in section [ results ] . as in the previous case of an inflaton that decays into scalars , we find that these solutions do not agree well . in general , the adiabatic approximation appears to overestimate the damping effect of particle radiation on the inflaton motion ; in particular , we find that overdamping predicted by the adiabatic approximation , is not exhibited by the nonequilibrium evolution",
    ".    a self - contained summary and discussion of these results is given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we derive a set of exact equations for the time evolution of a system of fermions that are free , apart from a coupling to the classical inflaton ; this gives rise to an effective time - dependent mass @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the bare mass .",

    "the approximate nonequilibrium evolution equations developed in section [ deriv ] lead to the local equation of motion ( [ eomad ] ) only when we make the extra approximation of replacing self - energies ( from which the functions @xmath189 and @xmath145 are derived ) with their values in a state of thermal equilibrium , together with the time - derivative expansion which then becomes possible . on the face of it , one might expect these further approximations to be fairly harmless , at least for a system that does not evolve too fast , and does not stray too far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , the numerical calculations described in @xcite for the case of an inflaton coupled to scalar particles showed that the nonequilibrium evolution governed by a set of equations analogous to those of section [ deriv ] is not well represented by the corresponding adiabatic approximation , even under circumstances when that approximation might seem to be reasonably well justified .",
    "we therefore discuss in this section a similar numerical comparison of the time evolution generated by the nonequilibrium equations described in sections [ deriv ] and [ renorm ] , with that generated by the adiabatic approximation of section [ adiabatic ] .",
    "to discretize the nonequilibrium time evolution , we use a semi - implicit method defined schematically by @xmath201\\frac{\\delta t}{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath202 represents the whole collection of variables @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath164 , @xmath78 , @xmath200 , and @xmath79 and @xmath203 labels time steps . in the absence of the @xmath204 interaction , it is straightforward to show that this method is stable for our problem .",
    "crucially , it is also simple enough that we can implement a discretized version of the renormalization scheme of section [ renorm ] that is exact up to rounding errors .",
    "when interactions are included , stability of the resulting set of integro - differential equations is very hard to analyse .",
    "we do in fact see evidence of instability when the calculations are pursued for sufficiently long times , but the results presented below are for periods of time for which the effects of this instability appear to be negligible .",
    "moreover , although the renormalized total energy ( [ renormenergy ] ) is exactly conserved in the continuum limit , there is no local discretized version of this expression that is exactly conserved by the discretized evolution equations . as a rough check on our computations ,",
    "we have evaluated a discretized version of ( [ renormenergy ] ) , but we do not expect it to be exactly conserved .",
    "in particular , divergent contributions to the integral , which cancel by construction in the continuum limit , are not guaranteed to cancel when time evolution is discretized . in practice ,",
    "all the initial conditions we have considered lead to an oscillatory solution for @xmath138 ; we find that energy acquires an oscillatory component ( with amplitude of order 5% of the total ) , consistent with incomplete cancellation of the divergent integral proportional to @xmath205 , together with a drift amounting to a few percent over the time intervals of interest .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is not affected by these issues . here , no renormalization is required ; semi - implicit discretization of the one remaining differential equation , the equation of motion ( [ eomad ] ) , leads to a stable problem ; and exact conservation of energy is imposed as the criterion for determining @xmath174 .",
    "intuitively , this approximation ought to be good when @xmath138 is slowly varying and thermalization of the created particles is efficient .",
    "a rough criterion for efficient thermalization is @xmath206 or , @xmath207 where @xmath208 is a relaxation time , which we take to be @xmath209 .    to obtain slow variation in @xmath138",
    ", we would ideally like to identify a set of parameters for which the motion is overdamped . within the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "one way of achieving this is to make the first term in the friction coefficient ( [ etaad ] ) large , by making @xmath145 relatively small , but this tends to make thermalization slow , at least according to the criterion ( [ thermcrit ] ) .",
    "the parameter space of couplings , masses and initial conditions is , even for the simple model considered here , too large to permit a systematic exploration , but we have not succeeded in locating a set of parameter values that leads both to overdamped motion and to a very small value of @xmath210 .",
    "( this was also true of the investigation reported in @xcite for an inflaton decaying into scalars ; in the context of warm inflation , it seems to be generally hard to devise simple field theory models that exhibit efficient thermalization as well as other desirable properties @xcite . )    nevertheless , we can find a situation in which the adiabatic approximation predicts overdamped motion , and @xmath210 is not too large .",
    "figure [ comparison ] shows the evolution of @xmath138 calculated from the nonequilibrium evolution equations and from the adiabatic approximation , with the parameter values @xmath211 ,",
    "@xmath212 , @xmath213 , and initial conditions @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "the solid curve is the motion generated by the adiabatic approximation , which is indeed overdamped ; we see , however , that the motion generated by the non - equilibrium equations without the adiabatic approximation ( dashed curve ) although it exhibits some damping is far from overdamped .     in both the adiabatic and non - equilibrium solutions .",
    "the initial conditions predict overdamping for the adiabatic solution . ]     and @xmath210 for early times .",
    "the thermalization is relatively efficient in this period and the two solutions are still very different ]    as in @xcite , this striking discrepancy does not seem to be accounted for by inefficient thermalization . in figure [ comparisontherm ]",
    "we show the early stages of the motion , along with the parameter @xmath210 as estimated within the adiabatic approximation . during this period of time",
    ", @xmath210 remains below 1 .",
    "thus , within the adiabatic approximation , one might well conclude that this approximation is reasonably self - consistent . while thermalization is not efficient enough to guarantee good accuracy",
    ", one would probably not anticipate the gross discrepancy between the two approximations for @xmath138 .     at @xmath217 for both the adiabatic and the non - equilibrium solutions . ]",
    "moreover , we compare in figure [ gammacomp ] the function @xmath145 calculated at @xmath218 from the nonequilibrium number densities with that calculated in the adiabatic approximation from an exactly thermal distribution . while some difference is visible , it seems clear that the small quantitative difference can not in itself account for difference between the overdamped and oscillatory motions apparent in figure [ comparisontherm ] .",
    "in fact , the difference between these motions can be understood in the way suggested in @xcite . at @xmath219",
    ", we chose an initial state of exact thermal equilibrium .",
    "denote by @xmath220 the integral ( [ eomint ] ) evaluated in this state , and let @xmath221 . at early times , when the value of @xmath0 has not changed by much , the nonequilibrium equation of motion ( [ eomne ] ) is given approximately by @xmath222 while the adiabatic approximation to this equation is @xmath223 as seen from figure [ comparisontherm ] , where @xmath224 , the velocity @xmath164 in the adiabatic approximation quickly approaches the `` terminal velocity '' @xmath225 and thereafter @xmath0 and @xmath164 evolve slowly , with @xmath226 .",
    "according to the original equation , by contrast , @xmath227 is still approximately equal to @xmath228 , leading to the dashed curve .",
    "clearly , in these circumstances , the original equation of motion is not well represented by the adiabatic approximation , and this is substantially independent of how well the number densities used to calculate @xmath229 and @xmath4 are thermalized .",
    "an example of the more generic case of underdamped motion is shown in figure [ underdamped ] .",
    "for both the adiabatic and non - equilibrium solutions ]    we see that the nonequilibrium evolution shows significant damping , but that the rate of damping is overestimated by the adiabatic approximation .",
    "this differs somewhat from the case of inflaton decay into scalars @xcite . in that case",
    ", the adiabatic approximation leads to a friction coefficient roughly proportional to @xmath230 , and thus to an overestimate of damping at large amplitudes , but an underestimate at small amplitudes .",
    "in this paper , we have sought to address a very specific issue : can the expectation value @xmath231 appearing in the generic inflaton equation of motion ( [ phieom ] ) , which is a non - local functional of @xmath0 , be adequately approximated by a local function of @xmath138 and @xmath14 , leading to a local equation of motion such as ( [ localeom ] ) .",
    "the conclusion suggested by the results of the two preceding sections is that it can not be , but these results are neither exact nor wholly rigorous , so it is worthwhile to summarize carefully the line of argument we have adopted .",
    "derivations of the local friction coefficient @xmath4 to be found in the literature vary somewhat in the details of implementation , but generally involve the _ assumption _ , characteristic of linear response theory , that under suitable conditions the state of the particles can be treated according to _ equilibrium _ field theory .",
    "the possibility of obtaining a local equation of motion then depends on the behaviour of the relevant integral kernels , which can be investigated in perturbation theory for specific models ( see , for example @xcite and , for recent discussions @xcite ) .",
    "we seek to avoid this assumption by studying instead the slow - evolution limit of the _ nonequilibrium _ state . in principle",
    ", this is certainly the more correct procedure ; in practice , however , nonequilibrium evolution is extremely hard to deal with by analytic means .",
    "the approximation scheme sketched in sections [ deriv ] and [ renorm ] is the lowest non - trivial order of a partially resummed perturbation theory .",
    "it leads to a local set of evolution equations , but we find that these equations do not admit a solution in the form of a time - derivative expansion , which is needed to derive the local equation of motion ( [ localeom ] ) , and consequently that this local equation of motion does not , in principle , exist .",
    "we can not altogether rule out the possibility that this result is a feature of our approximation scheme , rather than of the exact dynamics .",
    "quantitatively , indeed , the accuracy of the approximation is likely to be quite modest , though we have no good way of assessing this . however , the fact that it reproduces the exact dynamics of section [ freefer ] in the free - field limit , and that the boltzmann - like scattering terms have a sensible kinetic - theory interpretation , offers some reassurance that the approximation captures essential features of the nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "moreover , any improved method of studying nonequilibrium dynamics ( for example , the 2-particle - irreducible formalism developed by berges and coworkers ; see @xcite and references therein , especially @xcite ) is intrinsically non - local .",
    "it seems very likely that any attempt to derive a local equation of motion must follow a sequence of approximations more or less equivalent to that used here , and would fail at the same point .    even if the local equation of motion is formally not valid",
    ", it might nevertheless be a good approximation under suitable circumstances .",
    "indeed , we can recover essentially the same result for @xmath4 as that given by linear response methods by taking the further step of replacing nonequilibrium self - energies with those calculated in a state of thermal equilibrium : we called this the adiabatic approximation to our non - equilibrium evolution equations .",
    "intuitively , this would seem to be a fairly innocuous step if the evolution is fairly slow , and thermalization is not too inefficient . to test this , we obtained numerically , in section [ results ] , solutions for the motion of @xmath0 both with and without the adiabatic approximation . in order to focus on the frictional effect ( and to simplify the numerical calculation somewhat )",
    "we took the whole effective potential ( including the local part of @xmath231 ) to be approximated by the parabola @xmath232 . while this might significantly affect the actual motion obtained for @xmath138 , it is irrelevant for our purpose of assessing the effect of the extra adiabatic approximation .",
    "the results of this numerical comparison of the nonequilibrium and adiabatic approximations are broadly similar to those of the parallel calculations reported in @xcite for an inflaton decaying into scalars . in both cases , we find examples of conditions for which the adiabatic approximation predicts overdamped motion ( and so might seem , at least on the grounds of self - consistency , to be reliable ) , while the motion resulting from the `` full '' nonequilibrium evolution is oscillatory , with relatively little damping .",
    "( in neither case did we find conditions under which the frictional effect generated by the nonequilibrium evolution is sufficient to cause overdamping ; however , we were unable to explore the large parameter space exhaustively . ) even with the adiabatic approximation , underdamped motion seems to be more typical of the model we studied , but the magnitude of the frictional effect seems to be significantly overestimated by this approximation . for the model studied in this work , indeed , it seems that friction is always overestimated by the adiabatic approximation . in the case of inflaton decay into scalars , the adiabatic approximation yields a friction coefficient that contains a factor @xmath230 , and appears to overestimate the frictional effect when @xmath0 is large , while underestimating it when @xmath0 is small .    beyond the formal difficulty discussed in section [ adiabatic ] , the reasons for the failure of the adiabatic approximations are hard to identify in any detail .",
    "poor thermalization may be an issue , but as noted earlier , it seems implausible that the large discrepancies we observe are due merely to the quantitative effect of number densities that differ somewhat from a true thermal distribution .",
    "a more plausible possibility is that the discrepancies could be lessened simply by retaining more terms in the time - derivative expansion .",
    "comparison of ( [ od1 ] ) and ( [ od2 ] ) makes it rather obvious that , if the adiabatic motion is friction limited , so that @xmath225 and @xmath226 , and if the same value of @xmath0 and the same number densities are used to evaluate both the adiabatic and the `` full '' equation of motion , a large discrepancy is more or less inevitable .",
    "it could be , however , that this friction - limited motion does not lead to negligible values for higher - order terms in the time - derivative expansion , and that this accounts for the discrepancy .",
    "unfortunately , pursuing the adiabatic approximation to higher orders is rather complicated ( and not entirely unambiguous , in view of the evolving temperature we employed ) ; and to our knowledge , approximation schemes of this kind are not commonly used in the cosmological literature .",
    "the possibility of describing the dissipation of inflaton energy by a local friction term is primarily of interest in connection with warm inflation scenarios , and it should be emphasized that the results reported here and in @xcite do not in themselves determine whether or not such scenarios may be viable . to the extent that any generic result can be extracted , it seems that the adiabatic approximation overestimates the effects of dissipation : in particular , overdamped motion ( and hence warm inflation ) is apparently harder to achieve than the adiabatic approximation suggests .",
    "however , this may be true only of the simple models we have investigated .",
    "the somewhat discouraging conclusion is that no simple analytical approximation known to us represents dissipation reliably , and numerical investigations of the kind reported here offer a very inefficient tool for inflationary model building ."
