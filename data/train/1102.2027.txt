    "it has been widely accepted that the @xmath1 cluster structure exists in light nuclei.@xcite it has been also shown that the @xmath1 cluster picture persists even in the @xmath4-shell region like @xmath5ti where the spin - orbit force becomes strong.@xcite    clustering is realized due to the logic that the interaction of subunit clusters in nuclei is _ internally ( intracluster ) strong but externally ( intercluster ) weak_.@xcite this is most typically seen in @xmath6be with the @xmath1+@xmath1 cluster structure .",
    "this logic of _ internally strong but externally weak _ is justified by a microscopic model study which uses a two - body nuclear force and fully takes into account the pauli principle.@xcite    in the @xmath7-shell closure region , @xmath8o@xmath9 @xmath10ne , a weak coupling model was proposed phenomenologically @xcite to account for the similarity of the structure of the rotational band built on the mysterious 0@xmath11 state of @xmath8o at 6.06 mev and the intruder band in @xmath12f starting from the @xmath13 state at 0.11 mev to the ground band of @xmath10ne .",
    "nemoto and band @xcite clarified in the microscopic model that this weak coupling is a consequence of both the development of @xmath1 clustering and the pauli principle , which causes internally strong and externally weak binding of the clusters .",
    "the persistency of this weak coupling due to @xmath1 clustering in the @xmath14-shell closure region , @xmath15ca @xmath16ti , was also shown.@xcite it is important to know whether this weak coupling is universal and persists in much heavier nuclei where the closed shells for protons and neutrons are different .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study whether the weak coupling picture due to @xmath1 clustering still persists in the @xmath0 region .",
    "the structure of nuclei in the @xmath0 region has been mostly studied in the shell model and many properties have been successfully explained.@xcite however , for some nuclei the existence of intruder states , which are difficult in the shell model , have been suggested .",
    "for example , in the typical nucleus @xmath17mo , which has two protons and two neutrons outside the double closed shell , the shell model calculation needs a large effective charge to explain the large @xmath18 values of the ground band .    on the other hand , from the viewpoint of a unified description of bound and scattering for the @xmath1+@xmath19zr system , the present author suggested that the @xmath1 cluster model is still successful in understanding the structure of @xmath17mo.@xcite the structure of @xmath17mo",
    "is also described in the @xmath1+@xmath19zr cluster model using a phenomenological potential @xcite and a double folding model potential.@xcite    although there are not many experimental data of @xmath1 transfer reactions in this region compared with the @xmath10ne and @xmath5ti regions , there are some indications which suggest the importance of @xmath1 clustering in this mass region . for example , molnr _ et al . _ @xcite suggested that the intruder band states 0@xmath11(1.581 mev ) , 2@xmath11 ( 2.225 mev ) and 4@xmath11 ( 2.857 mev ) in @xmath20zr have four - particle four - hole character just as in @xmath8o . in the @xmath19zr@xmath9@xmath17mo region @xmath1 transfer reactions , which were very powerful in light nuclei in selectively populating the @xmath1 cluster states , were reported @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath1 cluster states have not been clearly identified .",
    "therefore another approach from the viewpoint of @xmath1 clustering seems necessary .",
    "a unified description of @xmath1 cluster bound states and @xmath1 particle scattering may be one of the useful approaches in this region .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath5ti region where @xmath1 transfer reactions were not sufficiently available , a unified description of bound states and @xmath1 particle scattering from @xmath15ca using a global potential was powerful in revealing the @xmath1 clustering aspects in @xmath5ti and @xmath15ca.@xcite because the structure of the typical nucleus @xmath17mo has been shown to be described in the @xmath1 cluster model , it seems useful to take this approach for the nuclei in the @xmath19zr@xmath9@xmath17mo region .",
    "in fact , as displayed in fig .  1 , the observed angular distributions in @xmath1 particle scattering from @xmath2y at @xmath21=21 - 25 mev are very similar to those for @xmath1+@xmath19zr scattering .",
    "the observed excitation function at @xmath22=176@xmath23 for @xmath1+@xmath2y scattering shows a deep minimum at around @xmath21=23.4 mev similar to that for @xmath1+@xmath19zr scattering.@xcite furthermore , as seen in fig .  2",
    ", the band structures built on the 4p - nh states resemble each other as was the case in the @xmath8o@xmath9@xmath10ne region.@xcite    the above two facts , the close angular distributions in the scattering ( fig .  1 ) and the energy levels with a similar band structure ( fig .",
    "2 ) , suggest that the potentials for the @xmath1+@xmath2y and the @xmath1+@xmath19zr systems are very similar . as the @xmath1+@xmath19zr structure in @xmath17mo is an analog of the @xmath1+@xmath8o cluster structure in @xmath10ne and the @xmath1+@xmath15ca cluster structure in @xmath5ti , the @xmath1+@xmath2y structure in @xmath3nb",
    "may be regarded an analog of the @xmath1+@xmath24n structure in @xmath12f in the @xmath14-shell and the @xmath1+@xmath25k structure in @xmath26sc in the @xmath4-shell .",
    "therefore , to clarify whether the weak coupling feature persists in the heavier @xmath0 region it seems useful to study the @xmath1+@xmath2y cluster structure of @xmath3nb in comparison with the @xmath1+@xmath19zr structure of @xmath17mo .",
    "recently kiss _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite extended the measurement of @xmath1+@xmath2y scattering to the lower energies , @xmath21=16.2 and 19.4 mev .",
    "also a large @xmath18 value of the electric transition in @xmath3nb has been observed by orce _",
    "we analyze the @xmath1+@xmath2y scattering by taking a woods - saxon squared phenomenological potential , which is similar to the one used for the @xmath1+@xmath19zr system.@xcite the form factor of the optical potential is given in the standard notation as follow@xcite :    @xmath27\\}/ \\{1+\\exp[(r - r_v)/2a_v]\\}^2+v_c(r ) , \\\\\\ ] ]    @xmath28\\}^2,\\ ] ]    for the real and imaginary potentials , respectively .",
    "the coulomb potential @xmath29 is assumed to be a uniformly charged sphere with a radius @xmath30=7.49 fm .",
    "the real potential parameters @xmath31=35 mev , @xmath32=7.49 fm , @xmath330.43 fm , @xmath34=4.86 fm and @xmath1=4.748 are fixed for all the incident energies .",
    "the @xmath31 , @xmath35 and @xmath1 parameters are the same as those for the @xmath1+@xmath19zr system , and the @xmath32 and @xmath34 parameters are scaled from those for the @xmath1+@xmath19zr system.@xcite the imaginary potential parameters were adjusted to fit the data and are given in table i.    as shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "a good agreement is obtained with the experimental data .",
    "the characteristic deep minimum in the angular distribution at the extreme backward angle at @xmath21=23.4 mev , which is also seen in the @xmath1+@xmath19zr scattering ( fig .  1 ) , is well reproduced by the calculation .",
    "as discussed in the @xmath1+@xmath19zr scattering @xcite , the oscillatory structure of the angular distribution at the backward angular region and the deep minimum at the extreme backward angle @xmath22=176@xmath23 at @xmath21=23.4 mev are caused by the interference between the internal waves , which penetrate deep into the internal region of the potential and the barrier waves , which are reflected at the surface region of the potential .",
    "this shows that absorption is incomplete and transparent for the @xmath1+@xmath2y scattering in this energy region and the potential can be checked not only at the surface region but also in the internal region .",
    "this means that the real part of the obtained potential may be used for the @xmath1+@xmath2y cluster structure calculation in @xmath3nb .",
    "as shown in fig .  4 , in @xmath3nb the first excited state @xmath13 appears at an extremely low excitation energy , @xmath36=0.031 mev above the ground state @xmath37 similar to the @xmath13 state at 0.11 mev with a well - developed @xmath1+@xmath24n cluster structure in @xmath12f .",
    "in the @xmath1 cluster model this state may be understood qualitatively that an @xmath1 particle is orbiting around the core nucleus @xmath2y(@xmath13 ) with an orbital angular momentum @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39 state at @xmath36=0.687 mev and the @xmath40 state at @xmath36=0.810 mev are considered to be doublet states , in which the @xmath1 particle is orbiting around the core with @xmath41 . recently",
    "orce _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite observed a strong @xmath42 transition from the @xmath43 state at @xmath36=1.500 mev to the @xmath40 state ( @xmath36=0.810 mev ) with @xmath44)=26.4@xmath45 w.u .",
    "this state may be considered to be a partner of the doublet states , in which the @xmath1 particle is coupled to the core with @xmath46 .",
    "the state at 1.364 mev is reported to be @xmath40 or @xmath47.@xcite    the calculated energy levels and the @xmath18 values are displayed in fig .  4 in comparison with the experimental data.@xcite in the calculation of the @xmath1 cluster structure we take the real potential parameters used in the analysis of @xmath1 + @xmath2y scattering .",
    "to take account of the angular momentum dependence of the real potential , as discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] , we assume @xmath1=@xmath48-@xmath49@xmath50 . @xmath48=4.17 is fine tuned to reproduce the experimental threshold energy and @xmath49=0.005 is used , which is very small , consistent with the values needed in the @xmath5ti and @xmath17mo cases.@xcite no spin - orbit potential is introduced .",
    "the calculated @xmath51 band states , which satisfy the wildermuth condition @xmath52=@xmath53=16 with @xmath54 being the number of nodes of the relative wave function , fall well near the experimental states .",
    "the agreement of the calculated energy levels with the experimental data is good .",
    "the experimental @xmath18 value of the @xmath42 transition from the @xmath43 state ( 1.500 mev ) to the @xmath40 state ( 0.810 mev ) is reproduced well with a small effective charge @xmath55e=0.2 , which is consistent with the value in ref .",
    "[ ] . in fig .  4",
    ", we note that the calculated and observed @xmath44 ) values for @xmath3nb are comparable to the observed values for @xmath17mo . thus it is found that the @xmath1 cluster model works in @xmath3nb in addition to @xmath17mo and the structure of the energy levels and the @xmath18 values suggests that weak coupling picture due to @xmath1 clustering persists in this mass region .",
    "the @xmath1-hole energy estimated from the experimental binding energies of @xmath17mo , @xmath19zr , @xmath3nb , @xmath2y and the @xmath1 particles is 0.17 mev for a proton hole in the @xmath56 shell .",
    "this is still small compared with 0.86 mev of the @xmath1-hole energy in @xmath12f.@xcite it is desired to observe the @xmath42 transition from the @xmath40 state ( 0.810 mev ) to the @xmath13 ( 0.031 mev ) and to compare with the predicted value .",
    "we have studied @xmath1+@xmath2y scattering and the @xmath1+@xmath2y cluster structure in @xmath3nb in a unified way by using a phenomenological potential . it is found that the potential which reproduces the angular distributions in @xmath1+@xmath2y scattering is very similar to that for the @xmath1+@xmath19zr system . the calculated energy levels and @xmath18 values obtained using the potential reproduce the experimental data well .",
    "the weak coupling picture due to @xmath1 clustering seems to persist in @xmath3nb . a systematic measurement of the @xmath18 values of the nuclei in the @xmath19zr @xmath9 @xmath17mo region",
