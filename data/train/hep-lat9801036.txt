    "the u(1 ) lattice gauge model has been studied from the early days of numerical simulations of gauge theories @xcite .",
    "its apparent simplicity makes it a natural choice for testing concepts and techniques used in simulations of non - abelian lattice gauge theories .",
    "however it turned out that the abelian character of the u(1 ) model brings specific difficulties .",
    "it can be proven rigorously under rather general assumptions @xcite that abelian lattice gauge theories have a phase transition at finite coupling though the order is not known .",
    "the determination by numerical simulations of the properties of the critical point in compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory with wilson action and periodic boundary conditions has been strongly dependent of the computing power available at the time .",
    "the early simulations @xcite made runs with a few hundred iterations at each coupling constant on rather small ( @xmath1 to @xmath8 ) lattices .",
    "they reported a second - order phase transition but observed some signs of metastability with longer runs at isolated points .",
    "subsequent simulations @xcite made runs with a few thousand iterations on larger ( @xmath9 up to @xmath10 ) lattices .",
    "it became possible to histogram the runs and to observe a gap in the plaquette energy .",
    "they concluded to the existence of a first - order critical point but did notice a decrease of the gap with the lattice size which was later confirmed @xcite on @xmath11 and @xmath12 lattices .",
    "but the situation became still more confusing in the following years .",
    "indeed the results , always for lattices with periodic boundary conditions and with runs of @xmath13 length , have usually depended on which method was used for studying the phase transition .",
    "most studies using the monte - carlo renormalization group transformation @xcite have claimed a second order phase transition , but sometimes with very different critical exponents , whereas most works based on finite size scaling theory @xcite have concluded to a first - order transition , but again with a critical exponent not consistent with the first - order prediction .",
    "these discrepancies led the subject into an expectant state .",
    "the interest about the nature of the phase transition has been revived more recently by two new kinds of results .",
    "the role played by topological excitations , the monopoles , had been the object of inquiries since the very beginning of numerical studies of the u(1 ) lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the influence of topology on the critical properties can be probed in several ways .",
    "one approach @xcite is to add to the standard wilson action a coupling @xmath14 controlling the density of monopoles .",
    "there is some evidence @xcite in favor of the existence of a non - gaussian second - order critical point in the @xmath15 plane when monopoles are suppressed .",
    "there is also preliminary evidence @xcite against universality with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "another approach @xcite is to study the compact u(1 ) gauge theory on lattices with sphere - like topology with a wilson action extended by a coupling @xmath16 of charge 2 @xmath17 no signs of metastability are found on these lattices for @xmath18 . a finite - size scaling analysis of the data on sphere - like lattices",
    "@xcite has concluded to the existence , for @xmath18 , of a second - order transition with a non - gaussian continuum limit .",
    "however we must notice that the critical exponents of these two approaches are still different .",
    "the latter result has spawned further investigations .",
    "there has been a study @xcite of the scaling behaviour of gauge - ball masses and of the static potential , which claims to confirm the second - order nature of the transition also on lattices with periodic boundary conditions at @xmath19 and @xmath20 with a critical exponent @xmath21 consistent with universality and the finite - size scaling analysis of sphere - like lattices .",
    "the results on lattices with spherical topology could also lend support to the suspicion that the first - order signal observed on toroidal lattices might be a finite - size effect due to the topology of the lattice .",
    "this suspicion had been raised by the observation of the decrease of the gap mentioned above .",
    "however the measurements of gaps were not accurate enough and systematic enough to make a statement about the infinite volume limit .",
    "the particular case of the wilson action was therefore re - investigated @xcite with increased statistics ( @xmath22 for each coupling constant ) and an emphasis on the study of gaps .",
    "there was definite evidence that the latent heat extrapolates to a non - zero value in the infinite volume limit of toroidal lattices .",
    "moreover the measurement of the critical exponent , @xmath23 , though clearly different from the first - order prediction , was not statistically consistent with the claim of universality with respect to the coupling @xmath16 .",
    "therefore there is always an apparent contradiction between the simulations on lattices with sphere - like topology and on lattices with periodic boundary conditions since one observes a gap on the latter even when @xmath24 .",
    "moreover the dispersion of the predicted values for the critical exponent @xmath0 is always as large as before , despite the increase in statistics since the last decade .",
    "one can fairly state that the confusion about the nature of the transition has also increased !",
    "but one can now strongly suspect that the origin of these paradoxical results could be explained by the presence of systematic corrections to the asymptotic finite - size scaling formulas .",
    "this will be our working hypothesis .",
    "there are two ways of circumventing these corrections .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to simulate the largest possible lattices for a given computing power .",
    "however , for a transition with a weak first - order signal like u(1 ) , one must thoroughly assess whether the number of tunnelling events is sufficient to get statistically reliable results .",
    "the other approach is to perform a finite - size scaling analysis of the four - dimensional compact u(1 ) gauge theory on smaller lattices but with the same quality standard as the best analyses of three - dimensional spin models .",
    "such an analysis must meet two criteria .",
    "on the one hand the simulation must be done on many lattice sizes ( and not restricted to 3 or 4 data points as is so often the case ) in order to be able to test the _ stability _ of the fits . on the other hand",
    "the statistics must be large enough to _ disentangle _ the systematic errors from the statistical errors .",
    "only then can we interpret correctly the observed deviations in a critical exponent extracted from different observables .",
    "we can learn from the two and three dimensional numerical studies of spin models how large the statistics must be : one needs at least @xmath25 configurations at each coupling constant .",
    "none of the presently published studies of the u(1 ) phase transition satisfy both constraints and we contend that this is the source of the contradictory results .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present a study at eight lattice sizes with statistics up to @xmath26 at each pseudo - critical coupling after reweighting and to clarify the nature of the u(1 ) phase transition . in the next section",
    "we shall review the part of finite - size scaling theory that we shall need in the sequel to interpret the data .",
    "then we shall describe the details of our monte - carlo simulation and present the results of the measurements . in the following sections we shall discuss , for various cumulants , the finite - size scaling analysis of their pseudo - critical couplings and of their extrema .",
    "the conclusion will be devoted to putting all these results into a coherent perspective .",
    "most of the numerical finite - size scaling analyses of the phase transition in the u(1 ) lattice gauge theory have been restricted to the specific - heat and the binder cumulant .",
    "when scaling violations are important , as it turns out for u(1 ) , introducing higher - order cumulants brings some improvement as we shall explain below .",
    "most reviews on finite - size scaling theory discuss the magnetic cumulants only .",
    "studying energy cumulants carries some specific features .",
    "even if this is standard lore we shall briefly remind some useful formulas not always easy to find elsewhere .",
    "first , to fix our notations , we recall that the canonical partition function of a lattice gauge theory on a @xmath27-dimensional cubic lattice of size @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the microcanonical partition function , @xmath31 is the plaquette energy and the volume , for a lattice gauge theory , is @xmath32 .",
    "standard arguments @xcite lead for continuous phase transitions to the free energy density decomposition in a singular part and an analytic contribution : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scaling variable and @xmath35 is the reduced coupling . in this parameterization",
    ", the hyperscaling relation @xmath36 is assumed with only one relevant scaling variable @xmath37 and no dangerous irrelevant variable .",
    "moreover one assumes that there are no marginal variables and no logarithmic bulk singularities , even if we work in dimension @xmath38 , which could be the upper critical dimension of the continuum limit if there were a second - order phase transition .",
    "the function @xmath39 represents the non - singular contribution of the background to the free energy density .",
    "@xmath40 is an analytic function in @xmath41 .",
    "its dependence upon @xmath28 is not so clear .",
    "there is a conjecture @xcite that for periodic systems one can take @xmath42 .",
    "we shall assume that this conjecture holds true and that the @xmath28-dependence is exponentially suppressed : @xmath43 however one must be aware that for systems with free boundary conditions one expects in general that @xmath44 can have geometrical terms present , which are proportional to inverse integral powers of @xmath45 .",
    "there are further analytic corrections introduced by non - linearities in the scaling variables away from criticality either when solving the renormalization group beyond the linear approximation , @xmath46 , or for instance , when using @xmath47 instead of @xmath41 . expressing the non - linear scaling variable @xmath48 in terms of @xmath37 yields corrections in powers of @xmath49 .",
    "we will neglect these corrections .",
    "in the renormalization group description of second - order phase transitions , one expects corrections to the asymptotic scaling function @xmath50 induced by the irrelevant variables .",
    "we shall keep the leading contribution in these corrections and parameterize it by an exponent @xmath51 .",
    "therefore we write @xmath52 we stress that this ansatz for the free energy density is a natural , but completely phenomenological generalization of the asymptotic scaling formula . moreover",
    "this ansatz still depends at least upon 4 parameters .",
    "it is not yet possible to extract that many parameters from a numerical finite - size analysis .",
    "we will have to resort to further approximations and limit ourselves to considering three - parameter fitting anstze .",
    "ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) can also describe the finite - size behavior at first - order transitions .",
    "even if there is not so much known about this behavior from a theoretical standpoint , one usually expects @xcite that @xmath53 .",
    "heuristic arguments based on the double - gaussian approximation @xcite predict that the corrections should be expressible as a power series in @xmath6 . these arguments can be put onto a rigorous basis @xcite in the special case of q - states potts models for large q.      in principle we would better like to determine directly the finite - size scaling properties of @xmath30 or equivalently of the probability distribution @xmath54 of the plaquette energy . in practice",
    "it is more convenient to extract the different moments of the plaquette distribution : @xmath55 then , with ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) it is easy to derive the scaling properties of any cumulant from these moments .",
    "the choice of cumulants to include in the analysis is , in a large respect , rather arbitrary .",
    "of course , for the sake of comparison with previous works , we have to study standard cumulants such as the specific heat : @xmath56 and the binder cumulant : @xmath57 we shall also introduce the second cumulant : @xmath58 these low - order cumulants are sensitive to the analytic contribution to the free energy density in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) . for instance",
    "ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) implies the following for the scaling behavior of the specific heat : @xmath59 but we know that @xmath60 and we can expect that @xmath61 .",
    "such an approximate equality would imply that the next - to - leading contribution comes both from the corrections to scaling and from the analytic background .",
    "then we can anticipate difficulties in describing the scaling behavior of the specific heat with three - parameter anstze .    in the same way the predicted finite - size scaling behavior of the second cumulant and the binder cumulant",
    "is : @xmath62 @xmath63 the corrections to scaling are now governed by the exponent @xmath64 .",
    "we can expect to run into problems describing these corrections when @xmath65 . in the limit @xmath66 , for first - order transitions , eqs .",
    "( [ cvfss],[u2fss],[u4fss ] ) yield the correct leading behavior but the corrections become of order @xmath67 .",
    "one can notice @xcite that deriving eqs .",
    "( [ cvfss],[u2fss],[u4fss ] ) with respect to @xmath68 introduces an additional factor @xmath69 through the scaling variable @xmath37 . therefore studying the finite - size scaling behavior of the derivatives of the standard cumulants",
    "should make it easier to determine the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "we have also introduced these cumulants into our analysis :    @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath71    @xmath72    in order to make a comparison between different lattice sizes one still needs a prescription to define a common value of the scaling variable @xmath37 .",
    "one usually uses the location of an extremum of a cumulant @xmath73 to define a universal value @xmath74 , independent of @xmath28 .",
    "when there are several extrema it is natural to choose the extremum closest to the infinite volume critical point .",
    "[ fig : std ] displays the plots of the cumulants @xmath75 and their derivatives @xmath76 as a function of @xmath68 and which extremum we have studied in each case .",
    "they have been produced by reweighting a run with @xmath77 iterations on a @xmath2 lattice at @xmath78 .",
    "we recall that the critical coupling of u(1 ) lattice gauge with wilson action and periodic boundary conditions is @xmath79 .",
    "c +      we have just seen that it is not always easy to interpret the scaling corrections to the standard cumulants or their derivatives .",
    "the interpretation would be more tractable if we could study cumulants which are directly expressible in terms of the free energy .",
    "in particular we can introduce the energy cumulants @xmath80 @xcite which are defined through the taylor expansion of the free energy density @xmath44 : @xmath81 the finite - size scaling behavior of these energy cumulants is much simpler since they are simply the derivatives of the free energy density : @xmath82 the analytic piece @xmath83 can be neglected as soon as @xmath84 .",
    "the first three cumulants coincide with the central moments : @xmath85 the higher - order cumulants can be expressed as non - linear combinations of the central moments @xmath86 .",
    "we shall introduce in our analysis the cumulants @xmath87 up to sixth order : @xmath88 fig .",
    "[ fig : kn ] displays the plots of the cumulants @xmath89 on a @xmath90 lattice as a function of @xmath68 and which extremum we have studied in each case .",
    "c +    these energy cumulants have not been studied very often in finite - size scaling analyses of phase transitions . in lower dimensions and for spin models",
    "the emphasis is of course on magnetic cumulants and the standard set of cumulants is natural in this context .",
    "the energy cumulants @xmath87 are more suitable to the analysis of four - dimensional field theories .",
    "previous studies @xcite provide us already with a good knowledge of the locations of pseudo - critical couplings at eight lattice sizes .",
    "we have therefore decided to increase the statistics at several couplings inside the error bars of these pseudo - critical points . for each coupling we did at least two runs with hot and cold starts , different random generators with large periods , and statistics of @xmath91 configurations . for a complete overview of our statistics",
    "we refer to table [ tab : mcit ] .",
    "the simulated @xmath68-values are quite close to each other and we can use the spectral density method @xcite to study the pseudo - critical points without noticeable extrapolation errors .",
    ".number of configurations generated on different lattice sizes .",
    "mc indicates multicanonical data .",
    "simulations were performed in steps of @xmath92 . [ cols=\">,^,>,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the main feature is the smallness of the ratios @xmath93 . in the first - order fits ,",
    "the leading contribution @xmath94 is generally smaller than the correction term @xmath95 up to the lattice size @xmath7 .",
    "it is no surprise that the first - order nature of the transition is so difficult to observe .",
    "we can get order - of - magnitude estimates of the parameters of a first - order transition by comparing the values of @xmath94 with the predictions of the ( very crude ) double - gaussian approximation @xcite .",
    "the height of the maximum of the specific heat should increase linearly with @xmath96 as : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the infinite - volume critical coupling and @xmath99 is the latent heat .",
    "we find @xmath100 the minimum of the binder cumulant is predicted to be @xcite : @xmath101 we get another estimate of the latent heat which agrees pretty well with ( [ gap1 ] ) : @xmath102",
    "our study shows that finite - size scaling violations are indeed present in each observable for lattice sizes @xmath103 .",
    "the observed scaling violations are consistent for all observables : the critical exponent @xmath0 systematically * decreases * with the lattice size @xmath28 .",
    "asymptotic finite - size scaling of all cumulants and of their pseudo - critical couplings yields consistently @xmath104 for @xmath105 which points towards a first - order transition .",
    "the scaling violations in the pseudo - critical couplings and the cumulant values decrease slowly with the lattice size .",
    "this slow variation , which is hard to unravel , can explain the claims for a second - order transition with @xmath106 .",
    "however the scaling violations seem to decrease more rapidly for the derivatives of the standard cumulants and for the cumulants @xmath87 .",
    "the finite - size size behavior of all these cumulants can be completely described in the range @xmath107 by volume correction terms of order @xmath6 and @xmath108 .",
    "the cumulant @xmath109 is even completely described by the asymptotic first - order formula .",
    "there seems to be a correlation between the amount of scaling violations in each cumulant extremum and the location of its pseudo - critical - coupling . the closer the pseudo - critical coupling is , at fixed lattice size , from the infinite - volume critical point , the better the description of the extremum by a first - order transition .",
    "all the cumulants we have studied follow this rule . then we can make two observations .    on the one hand , if we had chosen to study the extremum in each cumulant which is farthest from @xmath110 we would certainly have found a behavior inconsistent with a first - order transition and concluded to a second - order transition with a critical exponent @xmath0 _ greater _ than 0.33 .",
    "we suggest that this is the origin of many claims for a large critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "most of them are not based on finite - size scaling analyses of the standard cumulants , which all should give @xmath111 , but come from various analyses done at couplings @xmath68 smaller than @xmath112 , the pseudo - critical coupling of the specific heat in the corresponding lattices .    on the other hand",
    "we could think of studying still higher - order @xmath87 cumulants to get closer to @xmath110 .",
    "however we would face two difficulties .",
    "first the statistical noise increases with @xmath113 .",
    "secondly the extrapolation from the couplings where we generated our configurations gets large .",
    "the solution might be to generate the configurations for all lattice sizes at the infinite - volume critical point and use the method developed @xcite for the study of first - order transitions in potts models .",
    "however it is not clear how the proofs can be extended to the case of the u(1 ) phase transition .",
    "potts models have a discrete symmetry and a local order parameter whereas the u(1 ) lattice gauge theory has a continuous local symmetry and a non - local order parameter since the proof of existence of the phase transition uses the wilson criterion @xcite . in potts models",
    "the physical correlation lengths in both pure phases stay finite in the infinite volume limit whereas there exist massless photons in the ordered phase of u(1 ) .",
    "clearly the u(1 ) lattice gauge theory deserves as much numerical study as the lower - dimensional spin models and theoretical understanding of the scaling violations will be required before a definitive conclusion on the nature of its phase transition .",
