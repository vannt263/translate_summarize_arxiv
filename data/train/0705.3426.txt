    "the corrections necessary to generate a higgs mass consistent with direct lep bounds @xcite requires even more fine - tuning .",
    "the tight constraints on msugra compel us to study more natural  _ i.e_. less fine - tuned  models of supersymmetry .",
    "the most general superpotential with the mssm field content includes lepton and baryon number violating terms @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 are flavor indices .",
    "bounds on proton decay severely constrain the combination of baryon and lepton number violation . separately , however , they are much more weakly constrained . throughout the following we restrict our attention to the baryon number violating operators , the @xmath4 terms .",
    "this choice is motivated by the interesting and challenging phenomenology it produces .",
    "the bounds for squark masses in this scenario are typically below 100 gev @xcite ; some particles , such as the gluino and lightest sbottom , do not have published bounds above @xmath5 gev in regions of parameter space @xcite . moreover , the bound on the higgs can be below the z mass when decays to neutralinos are kinematically allowed @xcite .",
    "the phenomenologically interesting feature of this model is that the lightest superpartner - taken to be a neutralino - is unstable .",
    "it decays to three quarks . with regard to supersymmetry at the lhc ,",
    "the signals are changed significantly  missing energy signals are largely absent , and the number of isolated leptons is reduced due to increased soft jet production @xcite .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments @xcite will have weakened sensitivity to this scenario because their triggers are designed to exploit missing transverse energy and isolated leptons . in the case of squark or gluino production",
    "the associated jets should pass the triggers at atlas and cms , however hard jets are typically pre - scaled by a large factor that would significantly reduce the effective luminosity @xcite . even if the trigger issue is solved , it is not clear that pure multi - jet events coming from this new physics can be seen above the ( unknown ) qcd background . yet more worrisome",

    "no obvious search strategy presents itself , while the standard searches are made more difficult with the reduced branching ratios .",
    "the lightest neutralino has a macroscopic decay length in broad regions of parameter space .",
    "while neither atlas nor cms currently employ a displaced vertex trigger , lhcb @xcite is designed to trigger on and reconstruct such events .",
    "lhcb operates at a center of mass energy equal to that of atlas and cms ( 14 tev ) .",

    "the experiment is designed to make measurements of rare @xmath7-hadron decays by relying on their ability to precisely reconstruct displaced vertices .",
    "the lower luminosity limits the average number of interactions per bunch crossing to @xmath8 1 , which allows for more precise vertexing .",

    "we have neglected yukawa couplings , qcd corrections and phase - space corrections ( taking final state particles as massless ) .",

    "yukawa couplings are relevant to the extent that the lightest neutralino is partially higgsino . for higgs production and decay ,",
    "the neutralino is much lighter than the top , and for the decay to neutralinos to dominate , it turns out @xmath33 should not be too large @xcite , and therefore all relevant yukawa couplings are small . in the case of squark production , we will look only at the ` pure bino ' limit ( making the higgsinos and winos heavy ) , and thus we can ignore the yukawas entirely . in the former case , @xmath32 is less than and of order unity . in the latter case ( pure bino limit ) , @xmath34 .",

    "the background is taken to be multiple @xmath7 production .",
    "we use pythia to simulate @xmath53 events .",
    "madgraph v4.1.19 @xcite is used to compute matrix elements of @xmath54 @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xmath57 , and @xmath56 @xmath58 while pythia is used to shower these events . *",
    "we find that the following cuts and triggers discriminate the signal and background : * * requiring a displaced vertex with 300 @xmath59 m @xmath60 0.4 m and @xmath61 60 @xmath59 m , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the horizontal and perpendicular distance from the interaction point . * * requiring at least 5 tracks from the displaced vertex . * * requiring at least two tracks with @xmath64 1 gev and a two - dimensional impact parameter of 0.07 mm @xmath65 15.0 mm * for offline discrimination we use invariant mass distributions of displaced vertices .",
    "we now describe the relevant aspects of the lhcb experiment @xcite and explain in detail the motivation for and expected results of these cuts .",
    "lhcb is asymmetric in theta ( polar angle ) acceptance .",
    "the horizontal acceptance is 15 mrad @xmath66 300 mrad while the maximum vertical acceptance is 250 mrad . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our analysis to the region 15 mrad @xmath66 250 mrad .",
    "offline reconstruction of the primary vertex is expected to have a resolution of @xmath8 50 @xmath59 m along the beam line and @xmath8 10 @xmath59 m perpendicular to it .",
    "the typical @xmath62 resolution of a secondary vertex is @xmath67 200 @xmath59 m .",
    "transverse resolution is @xmath68 dependent , and is @xmath67 20 @xmath59 m for 1 gev @xmath68 track .",
    "we assume that vertexing may be done up to 0.4 m along the beamline which corresponds to half of the vertex locator length @xcite , we set the resolution of a displaced vertex to be a cylinder of 200 @xmath59 m in @xmath62 and 30 @xmath59 m in @xmath63 .",
    "this means that if a second vertex lies outside this cylinder then it can be distinguished , otherwise it can not .",
    "we denote these lengths as @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the required minimum distances from the primary vertex as described above in @xmath62 and @xmath63 are denoted @xmath71 300 @xmath59 m and @xmath72 60 @xmath59 m .",
    "no detector effects beyond vertex resolution are considered .",
    "all superpartners produced at the lhc cascade to the lightest neutralino ( direct decays via r - parity violation are suppressed by the small @xmath23 coupling ) . for simplicity",
    "we look at squark pair production where each squark decays to a quark and the lightest neutralino . the goal of this search is to see one of these neutralinos in the lhcb acceptance .",
    "the signal we look for is a displaced vertex with a larger track multiplicity than a typical @xmath7 decay and an invariant mass of the tracks larger than the @xmath7 mass .",
    "the decay length may or may not be similar to a typical @xmath7 hadron , so we do not use this as a distinguishing feature .",
    "lhcb s level 0 ( l0 ) trigger is designed to reject multiple primary vertices ( ` pile up ' events ) and events with large numbers of tracks ( ` busy ' events ) .",
    "l0 reduces the data rate from @xmath67 12 mhz to @xmath67 1 mhz .",
    "we find that 95@xmath73 of our squark production signal ( one neutralino leaving at least 5 tracks in the detector acceptance ) passes l0 .",
    "the high level triggers ( hlt ) are responsible for reducing the rate to 2 khz , the read out rate .",
    "one component of the hlt is 2d track reconstruction searching for tracks with high @xmath74 ( @xmath75 1 gev ) and large impact parameter , 0.15 mm @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath76 3.0 mm , tracks .",
    "our signal generically produces more high @xmath74 tracks than the background because of the neutralino s greater mass and because it is the product of a heavy particle decay .",
    "however , we find that the proposed impact parameter window results in signal efficiencies below 10@xmath73 for decay lengths inconsistent with that of a @xmath7 . the signal efficiency is increased to above 50@xmath73 in most parts of parameter space if the impact parameter window is widened to 0.07 mm @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath76 15.0 mm .",
    "figure  [ fig : impactplot ] shows the efficiencies of the two ranges for a particular point in parameter space .    extending the impact parameter range to a lower value of 50 @xmath59 m",
    "is suggested in the context of lhcb upgrades @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of extending the range to large values in unknown and requires a detector simulation .",
    "the naive background for large impact parameter tracks is strange decays .",
    "this is because @xmath78 centimeters .",
    "if this is the case , it seems plausible that requiring multiple tracks with high @xmath68 can significantly reduce this background .",
    "henceforth we optimistically assume that the range can be extended .",
    "the expected event rate of neutralinos from squark production that pass our cuts are shown in figures  [ fig : acceptcp1 ] and  [ fig : acceptcp2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : squarkmass ] shows the signal invariant mass distributions of tracks for events that pass our cuts . as expected , these distributions reach far beyond the mass of a @xmath7-hadron , and thus we need not worry about isolated @xmath7 decays as a background .",
    "we find rather that the most important background ( offline ) consists of @xmath7-hadron events in which another particle , produced at the primary vertex , decays near enough to the @xmath7 that the vertices can not be resolved individually by the detector .",
    "we refer to these as overlapping events .",
    "we now give a rough quantitative estimate of the background .",
    "our region of interest is for track invariant masses above @xmath79 gev .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : squarkmass ] this region has a significant overlap with our signal .",
    "our limited computing power only allows us to simulate @xmath45 years of background , in which we find no events which pass our track cuts and have an invariant mass above 12 gev ( see figure [ fig : background ] ) . to better understand the background",
    ", we also look at the invariant mass of all decay products ( charged and uncharged ) from these overlapping events . using this information , we are able to define cuts which should in principle reduce our background to less than 1000 events per year .",
    "below , we describe how we come to this estimate .    the expression for the invariant mass of two particles is @xmath80 where @xmath14 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are the mass , energy , @xmath62-momentum and transverse momentum respectively of the @xmath12th particle , and @xmath84 is the difference in the azimuthal angle of the two particle momentum vectors .",
    "there are two overlap cases : 2@xmath7s and a @xmath7 plus a non-@xmath7 .",
    "we discuss the 2@xmath7 case .",
    "it is clear that the non - relativistic limit can not produce @xmath85 .",
    "the relativistic limit reduces ( [ eq : mass ] ) to @xmath86 where @xmath87 , the cosine of the polar angle of the momentum vector of the @xmath12th particle , and similarly , @xmath88 .",
    "( note , the region of parameter space where one @xmath7 is non - relativistic is a special case of what we discuss below ) .    examining the cross term we see that there are two interesting cases : @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the former case requires a large difference in polar or azimuthal angles to generate a large cross term . maximizing this difference ( for example , in the polar angle ) while demanding a large cross term and using @xmath91 leads to a minimum @xmath74 for the @xmath92hadrons .",
    "furthermore a large @xmath93 difference with a small transverse distance ( making the vertices unresolved ) requires the vertices to be as near the primary vertex as possible .",
    "these considerations significantly suppress the number of overlapping events . as an illustration",
    "we take @xmath94 m , the closer @xmath7 a transverse distance of 30 @xmath59 m from the @xmath62 axis , and the vertices a distance of 360 @xmath59 m from the primary vertex along the @xmath62 direction . demanding the cross term give 16 @xmath95 ( to get an invariant mass of all decay products , not just tracks , of just over 20 gev ) we find that @xmath96 160 gev .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath97 20 gev for the softer @xmath7 , a requirement which suppresses the cross section by better than @xmath45 and makes this parameter range irrelevant .",
    "conversely , the case in which @xmath98 is important even when the @xmath93 difference is small .",
    "the non - relativistic corrections  the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass2 ] )  dominate when the difference in angles vanish . generating a cross term of @xmath99 requires a ratio of 16:1 between the @xmath100 s . the softer @xmath7 ( call it @xmath101 ) decays dominantly at a length @xmath102 . now",
    "the harder @xmath7 has @xmath103 . using the requirement that @xmath104 ( so the displaced vertex satisfies our @xmath105 cut ) , and plugging the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 leads to the requirement @xmath107 . to estimate our background , we create a sample of @xmath45 years of 2@xmath7 production using pythia ( roughly @xmath108 events at leading order ) requiring both @xmath7s to decay within the acceptance of our detector and to pass our @xmath105 and @xmath109 requirements .",
    "we then count the number of events that satisfy @xmath110 and @xmath111 gev .",
    "the fraction of our sample which passes these cuts is one part in @xmath112 .",
    "then we take the same sample without the momentum requirements and find the number of overlap events to be 69  or scaled up , roughly @xmath113 per year .",
    "if we take the distribution of momenta among these events to be flat ( overly conservative ) , we can simply take a product of the two suppressions and estimate the number of events which have the potential to have a large enough invariant mass .",
    "our estimate is @xmath114 .",
    "if we include the fact that @xmath7 s with very different momenta will have very different decay lengths , we find another suppression of a factor of nearly an order of magnitude and thus expect a background to be at most on the order of hundreds of events .",
    "in addition to the @xmath115 background , there are overlap events generated in , for example , the 3@xmath7 background .",
    "we find no events where two @xmath7s overlap giving a large invariant mass , and using similar arguments to those above find that a full year should produce at most as many events as in the 2@xmath7 sample .",
    "however , we do find large invariant mass events in this sample which involve the overlap of a @xmath7 and a strange hadron decay .",
    "these events do not pass either the 5 track cut or the @xmath105 requirement . imposing both should in principle severely limit or eliminate events of this type , but",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to estimate .",
    "we will simply assume they can be removed by these or similar cuts . in figure",
    "[ fig : background ] we plot the invariant mass of overlapping vertices in the 3@xmath7 sample .",
    "we include in the plot the invariant mass of all decay products to see the large invariant mass events .",
    "all of the events with invariant masses larger than 10 gev are due to @xmath7-non-@xmath7 overlapping events .",
    "the other simulated backgrounds produce an overlapping event fraction about that of @xmath115 , and they are cross section suppressed by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we now estimate the parameter space that can be explored by lhcb .",
    "we assume a background of 400 events above 12 gev of track invariant mass .",
    "significance at the level of @xmath116 requires @xmath75 100 signal events above 12 gev .",
    "the regions of parameter space which exceed this event rate after cuts are :    * @xmath117 : * * @xmath118 : 200 gev @xmath8 @xmath40 @xmath8 600 gev .",

    ".      there exists an interesting region of parameter space in which the higgs dominantly decays to neutralinos .",
    "the signal invariant mass distribution becomes more background - like in this parameter space as @xmath123 becomes lighter .",
    "in fact the distribution is almost indistinguishable from the overlap background in figure [ fig : background ] for @xmath124 20 gev , in part because the neutralino vertex loses some of its track invariant mass through its decay to a @xmath7 whose decay products often reconstruct at a different point .",
    "however , a distinguishing characteristic of the signal is the possibility of both neutralinos being in the acceptance .",
    "an exemplary point is shown in figure [ fig : higgs_accept ] where we use the leading order inclusive higgs production cross section of @xmath125 pb @xcite .",
    "we see that at this point if @xmath126 gev then there are a significant number of higgs decays that deposit both neutralinos in the detector .",
    "the expected background for this signal is two sets of overlapping decays which should be negligiable .",
    "the rapid fall off of the acceptance distribution at small @xmath127 is primarily due to long decay length at these particular points .",
    "the decay length of a 20 gev neutralino for the prescribed parameters is @xmath128 0.2 m. given that such a neutralino is boosted by at least a factor 3 due to the higgs decay , we would not expect both neutralinos to be in the acceptance ( defined with an upper z limit of 0.4 m ) whereas it is not surprising that one of the decays is in the detector .",
    "reducing @xmath127 by a factor of 2 leads to 32 fold increase , plus a significant phase - space increase of @xmath129  hence the sparseness of accepted events at small @xmath127 .",
    "the addition of baryon number violating operators to the mssm superpotential allows for a more natural model of supersymmetry while also producing phenomenology that may pose difficulties for atlas and cms .",
    "the central phenomenological signature is displaced vertices for which the lhcb is well suited to observe and reconstruct .",
    "displaced vertices of @xmath92hadron decays is a potentially enormous background . despite computational limitation that forbid a full simulation of the background we can argue that it is plausible for large portions of parameter space to be explored .",
    "this is a consequence of the large invariant mass distribution of our signal , that necessitates coincident background decays .",
    "thus we estimate that lhcb could rule out a significant portion of parameter space .",
    "however , only the most nave detector issues have been considered and a full detector simulation is needed to understand the detector s true reach .",
    "in addition to r - parity violating supersymmetry , other versions of supersymmetry may also contain displaced vertices .",
    "this includes parts of parameter space with near degeneracies between the lsp and nlsp which could occur between , for example , a stau and a neutralino , or between neutralinos in theories with an added singlet field .",
    "finally , so - called ` hidden valley ' models @xcite also give rise to non - standard displaced vertices and have been suggested as good candidates for lhcb physics .",
    "a dedicated search at lhcb may provide the first discovery of new physics at the lhc .",

    "<S> the spectrum of supersymmetric theories with r - parity violation are much more weakly constrained than that of supersymmetric theories with a stable neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the signatures of supersymmetry at the lhcb experiment in the region of parameter space where the neutralino decay leaves a displaced vertex . </S>",
    "<S> we find sensitivity to squark production up to squark masses of order 1 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we note that if the higgs decays to neutralinos in this scenario , lhcb should see the lightest higgs boson before atlas and cms . </S>"
