    "much attention has been devoted to the spin degree of freedom in one - dimensional ( 1d ) conductors , both of the linear shape ( quantum wires  @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite ) and of a circular one ( quantum rings  @xcite ) .",
    "physical parameters of such systems , e.g. , average distance between the electrons @xmath0 , their total number @xmath1 , their effective mass @xmath2 , dielectric constant @xmath3 , etc .",
    ", can vary over a broad range or can be tuned experimentally .",
    "this creates unique opportunities for studying the effect of reduced dimensionality and strong coulomb interactions on quantum magnetism .",
    "a number of new developments have generated a particular interest to the physics of a 1d wigner - crystal ( wc ) .",
    "unlike the case in higher dimensions , in 1d the crossover to this strongly - correlated regime occurs at easily achievable electron densities  @xcite , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the effective bohr radius .",
    "disorder has been the only major obstacle to realizing the 1d wc experimentally  @xcite .",
    "a successfully solution to this problem has been apparently found , at least , for the case of carbon nanotubes .",
    "very large @xmath6 values have been recently demonstrated in suspended nanotube devices without appreciable intervention of disorder effects  @xcite .",
    "because of their finite length , in the desired range @xmath7 these devices contained only a few electrons , @xmath8 .",
    "such finite - size systems are traditionally referred to as wigner molecules  @xcite .",
    "the progress towards realizing wigner crystal ( molecule ) states in gaas quantum wires has also been very encouraging  @xcite , therefore , one may hope that they will soon follow suit .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the 1d wc is interesting because of a dramatic difference between the characteristic energy scales for orbital and spin dynamics .",
    "strong _ spin - charge separation has been recently predicted to cause anomalies in many essential electron properties , e.g. , ballistic conductance  @xcite of quantum wires and persistent current of quantum rings  @xcite . in view of the above ,",
    "obtaining a reliable estimate of the spin - related energy scales , notably , the exchange - coupling @xmath9 of the nearest - neighbour electrons , is desirable .",
    "it has been an outstanding challenge , though .",
    "as depicted in ( a ) , @xmath9 is determined by the acts of quantum tunnelling in which any two such electrons interchange . at @xmath10 the corresponding potential barrier greatly exceeds the kinetic energy of the electron pair , which makes @xmath9 exponential small and difficult to compute numerically  @xcite .",
    "attempts to derive @xmath9 analytically ( for the nontrivial case @xmath11 ) were based on the approximation that neglects all degrees of freedom in the problem except the distance between the two interchanging electrons  @xcite .",
    "we call this a frozen lattice approximation ( fla ) .",
    "the accuracy of the fla is unclear because it is not justified by any small parameter .",
    "when a given pair does its exchange , it sets all other electrons in motion , too ( ) . to obtain the much needed reliable estimate of @xmath9 one has to treat the spin exchange in a wigner molecule ( or a wc ) as a truly many - body process .",
    "this is done below in this letter , where we compute @xmath9 to the leading order in the large parameter @xmath6 .",

    "we assume that electrons are tightly confined in the transverse dimensions on a characteristic lengthscale @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to treat the problem as strictly 1d , provided we replace the coulomb law by the appropriate effective interaction that goes to a finite value at distances @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt a simple model form  @xcite @xmath20 , which is the simplest expression that correctly captures both short- and long - range behaviour of the ( unscreened ) coulomb interaction for _ any _ realistic confining potential and is similar to other forms used in the literature  @xcite . for convenience , we focus on the quantum ring geometry where @xmath21 is the chord distance and @xmath22 is the coordinate along the circumference .    in the wigner molecule configuration electrons reside at the corners of a regular polygon .",

'' at large @xmath6 , the total moment of inertia @xmath27 and the vibrational frequencies @xmath28 are easy to compute because they are close to their classical values . in order to calculate @xmath9 , which is more difficult ,",
