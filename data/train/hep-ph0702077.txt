    "proton structure at large @xmath3 and small bjorken @xmath1 has been extensively investigated in experiments at hera .",
    "this program is of great intrinsic interest and provides valuable information for the lhc program , where the short - distance structure of protons and nuclei will be probed at tev energies .",
    "two physical pictures that seem very different from each other are used to analyze hadronic structure functions for large @xmath3 and small @xmath1 .",
    "there is a parton picture , in which the hadron consists of partons and the partons undergo a hard collision that produces the final state .",
    "this is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "this applies at large @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding theoretical method is that of factorization .",
    "the cross section is written as a convolution of parton distribution functions , @xmath4 , and a hard cross section for partonic scattering .",
    "the parton distribution functions are evaluated at small @xmath1 , but the @xmath1 dependence is not predicted except insofar as it results from evolution starting from @xmath5 at a smaller virtuality scale @xmath6 .    there is an @xmath0-channel picture , in which one thinks of the event in the rest frame of one of the hadrons .",
    "see @xcite for recent accounts .",
    "this applies at small @xmath1 .",
    "the hard interaction takes place far outside the hadron and the products of the interaction travel toward the hadron and interact with it . in the simplest case , there are effectively two objects that collide with the hadron .",
    "these objects carry opposite color , so that they can be said to constitute a `` color dipole '' , described by a correlator of two eikonal wilson lines .",
    "an important concept here is that the cross section for the color dipole to scatter from the hadron can be simple when the transverse separation between the elements of the dipole are large .",
    "then the dipole always scatters as long as its impact parameter is within the hadron radius .",
    "one speaks of the cross section saturating  that is , being as large as it possibly could be @xcite .",
    "these pictures seem quite different , as they look at the collision in different reference frames , and lead to different theoretical methods , but they are not at all incompatible . in the region where their domains of validity overlap , they must describe the same physics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to connect the two pictures .",
    "we examine one of the main ingredients used in the parton picture , namely the distribution function for finding a quark in a hadron , defined as a hadronic matrix element of a certain product of operators @xcite .",
    "for very small @xmath1 , the parton system created by this operator is far outside the hadron .",
    "we analyze the evolution of the system using @xmath0-channel methods .",
    "we find that the quark distribution can be expressed as a wilson - line correlator convoluted with a simple lightcone wave function .",
    "moreover , we find that this answer allows one to relate with precision the seemingly dissimilar results for structure functions in the parton framework and the @xmath0-channel framework .",
    "part of the results of this analysis have been used in @xcite to investigate the power corrections to structure functions that arise from the @xmath0-channel picture .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin by applying the hamiltonian method  @xcite to the quark distribution function .",
    "this allows us to write the quark distribution as a convolution of a lightcone wave function and a matrix element of eikonal - line operators ( sec .",
    "[ sec : qua ] ) .",
    "we work in the lowest - order approximation , i.e. , the dipole approximation .",
    "the convolution formula provides a simple interpretation in coordinate space for the physical process that probes the distribution .",
    "the parton distribution is defined by matrix elements of operator products that require renormalization .",
    "we perform the renormalization at one loop using the @xmath7 subtraction scheme for the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the eikonal - operator matrix element receives contribution from both short distances and long distances .",
    "we first analyze it by an expansion in powers of @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 the strong coupling and @xmath10 the gauge field ) , valid at short distances ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dipoleandglu ] ) .",
    "this expansion is useful to carry out the matching with renormalization - group evolution equations .",
    "in particular , it allows us to relate the eikonal matrix element at short distances to a well - prescribed integral of the gluon distribution function .",
    "next , we motivate and discuss a widely used approach for modeling the eikonal - operator matrix element at large distances ( sec .  [",
    "sec : xi ] ) , based on parton saturation  @xcite . as the saturation scale in the quark sector is likely to be at much lower momenta than in the gluon sector ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we critically examine the validity of the treatment for the quark distribution , and the potential breakdown of the dipole approximation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : crit ] ) .",
    "we finally discuss the relation of our results for the quark distribution with known dipole results for structure functions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : strfun ] ) .",
    "this discussion also illustrates how standard factorization properties are reobtained from the @xmath0-channel point of view .",
    "some supplementary material is left to the appendices . in appendix",
    "[ app : little_u ] we collect calculational details on integrals of lightcone wave functions . in appendix",
    "[ sec : algeb ] we give a relation between products of eikonal operators for color - octet and color - triplet dipoles . in appendix",
    "[ app : ft ] we report details on applying the hamiltonian method to the hadronic matrix element of two currents .",
    "we study the quark distribution using the @xmath0-channel picture in the style of  @xcite .",
    "we start with the definition @xcite of the quark distribution as a proton matrix element of a certain operator , @xmath11 here for any four - vector @xmath12 we use lightcone components @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 the proton momentum is @xmath15 the operator @xmath16 is the path - ordered exponential of the color potential @xmath17 where the path ordering instruction @xmath18 puts fields and color matrices with the most positive values of @xmath19 to the left .",
    "equivalently , following the notation of @xcite , we can think of @xmath20 as creating an eikonal particle that moves in the minus direction , starting at minus coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "an eikonal particle is an imaginary particle that retains its plus and transverse positions no matter how much momentum it absorbs .",
    "the subscript @xmath22 on the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqdef ] ) indicates that we are to take the connected parts of the graphs , in which some partons from the proton states communicate with the indicated operators . the operator product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqdef ] ) is ultraviolet divergent and requires renormalization .",
    "we will use the standard @xmath7 prescription .",
    "the required subtraction at the one loop level is analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : renormalization ] .",
    "we begin by rewriting the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqdef ] ) so that it has the form of the real part of a forward scattering amplitude . to do this",

    "the @xmath32 here indicates this time ordering . for our purposes , it is helpful to insert a factor @xmath1 and another @xmath21 integral : @xmath33 the integral over @xmath34 can be thought of as setting the proton state to position @xmath35 .",
    "we have thus rewritten the original @xmath28 , which was analogous to a total cross section , as a green function analogous to a forward scattering amplitude .",
    "our next task is to break the scattering amplitude into parts that can be analyzed separately .",
    "the fourier transformed operator @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqasforwardscattering ] ) creates an antiquark and an eikonal particle with a total plus - momentum @xmath37 .",
    "we consider that @xmath1 is very small , say @xmath38 .",
    "that means that the typical distance @xmath39 from the proton to where the antiquark and the eikonal particle are created is large , of order @xmath40 .",
    "this is way outside the proton .",
    "the antiquark and eikonal particle develop into a shower of partons with minus - momenta of order @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the transverse momentum of the parton and @xmath43 is its virtuality and we take both of these to be of order @xmath44 .",
    "thus the partons created by the original operator have very large minus - momenta .",
    "we will speak of them as `` fast '' partons . as noted",
    ", the fast partons travel a long distance in @xmath21 before meeting the proton .",
    "when the fast partons meet the proton , they scatter from the gluon field of the proton , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sec2 ] .",
