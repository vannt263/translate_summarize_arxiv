    "conversely , let @xmath690 , and let @xmath691 , @xmath627 . since @xmath672 must also be the right - stabiliser of @xmath95 we have @xmath692 as well , and @xmath693 , as desired .",
    "we have seen that a type of a member of @xmath485 is generic if and only if the corresponding type in @xmath553 is a non forking extension of the unique type over @xmath563 , i.e. , if its @xmath552-type has the same cantor - bendixson ranks as all of @xmath485 for every @xmath545 .",
    "thus the various @xmath134-@xmath552-cantor - bendixson ranks play the role of stratified local ranks characterising genericity . in a superstable ( and even more so in an @xmath695-stable ) theory one would expect a similar characterisation via global lascar and/or morley ranks .",
    "we shall consider here the case of superstability and lascar ranks .",
    "morley ranks are studied in a subsequent paper @xcite , and similar results are proved .",
    "significant work regarding superstability has been carried out in the context of metric hausdorff cats , and in many cases definitions and proofs transfer verbatim to continuous logic .",
    "the objects of study in this context are partial types constructed from complete types and conditions of the form @xmath696 via conjunction and existential quantification .",
    "it is a general fact that if @xmath697 is a partial type then the property @xmath698 , where the existential quantifier is interpreted in a sufficiently saturated model , is definable by a partial type as well .",

    "let @xmath48 be a partial type and @xmath699 a real number .",
    "we define @xmath700 to be the partial type expressing that @xmath701 , i.e. , that @xmath49 is realised in the @xmath134-neighbourhood of @xmath37 . for a tuple @xmath15",
    "we shall use @xmath702 as a notational representation for the somewhat vague concept of `` @xmath15 known up to distance @xmath134 '' , so in particular @xmath703 is just another representation for @xmath15 . accordingly , if @xmath704 then we define @xmath705 , so in particular @xmath706 .    to an arbitrary theory @xmath2",
    "we define @xmath707 to be the least infinite cardinal , if such exists , such that for every complete type @xmath115 over a set @xmath30 , and for every @xmath40 , there is a subset @xmath708 such that @xmath709 does not divide over @xmath710 .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is _",
    "@xmath714-stable _ if for every set @xmath30 , @xmath715 , the metric density character of @xmath99 is at most @xmath714 .",
    "we define @xmath716 to be the least ( infinite ) cardinal of stability for @xmath2 .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is _ superstable _ if it is @xmath714-stable for all @xmath714 big enough .    in the context of henson s logic for banach space ,",
    "this definition dates back to iovino @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath2 is stable if and only if it is @xmath717-stable for all @xmath714 . in particular , @xmath2 is stable if and only if @xmath718 , in which case @xmath719 . the following is an example for a result whose statement and proof translate word - for - word to the continuous logic setting .        many of the arguments that follow are valid both for stable and for simple theories , and are stated as such , even though no development of simplicity theory for continuous logic exists in the literature",
    ". the reader may either refer to the development of simplicity in the context of cats @xcite , which encompasses that of continuous logic , or simply restrict his or her attention to the stable case .    in light of and of the definition of @xmath707",
    "we wish to define global forking ranks @xmath721 for @xmath40 such that @xmath722 if and only if @xmath15 `` @xmath134-depends '' on @xmath332 over @xmath232 .",
    "we have quite a bit of liberty in choosing what `` @xmath134-depends '' should mean ( i.e. , different choices can give rise to ranks which have all the properties we seek ) .",
    "for example , we could say that this happens if @xmath723 forks over @xmath232 , or if @xmath724 forks over @xmath232 . for consistency with earlier work we shall opt for a slightly more complex definition which was given in @xcite and which has some advantages over other definitions for the purposes of that paper .      1 .",
    "we say that an indiscernible sequence @xmath725 _ could be in @xmath726 _ if there are @xmath727 and a sequence @xmath728 such that @xmath729 is @xmath727-indiscernible , @xmath730 and @xmath731 .",

    "( in @xcite the notation @xmath738 was used . )    a few justifications for these definitions may be in place . indeed , for @xmath739 it is easy to see that a sequence @xmath740 could be in @xmath741 if and only if it admits a conjugate which is in @xmath742 in the ordinary sense . by a compactness argument ,",
    "this is further equivalent to the property that @xmath740 could be in @xmath726 for every @xmath40 .",
    "next , we wish to justify the notation @xmath743 .",
    "the result in @xcite on which this justification relies does not immediately make sense in continuous logic , since at some point it uses a local ranks argument which is specific to the formalism of compact abstract theories .",
    "the core of that argument resides in the following technical result , which indeed can be proved very quickly in many different contexts ( simple or stable theories , classical logic , continuous logic , cats ) using the appropriate local ranks .",
    "since the notion of local forking ranks varies drastically between contexts we shall provide here a more combinatorial and therefore more universal argument .",
    "[ lem : avoidlocalrank ] let @xmath744 , @xmath745 and @xmath73 be three tuples , possibly infinite , in a stable or even simple theory ( classical , continuous , or any other setting in which basic simplicity or stability hold ) .",

    "our induction hypothesis tells us that @xmath752 and @xmath758 . by standard independence calculus",
    "we obtain @xmath759 , whence @xmath760 , as desired .    since @xmath749 , there exists a @xmath745-indiscernible sequence @xmath761 , starting with @xmath762 , such that there exists no @xmath763 satisfying @xmath764 for all @xmath32 . for each @xmath277",

    "since @xmath769 , we may choose @xmath765 to be indiscernible over @xmath770 .",
    "let us now define @xmath771 for all @xmath277 and consider the sequence @xmath772 .",
    "applying compactness , we can find for arbitrarily big @xmath714 a sequence @xmath773 in @xmath774 , such that for each @xmath162 there exists a sequence @xmath775 which is indiscernible over @xmath776 such that @xmath777 , so in particular @xmath778 .",
    "each of these sequences witnesses that @xmath779 , contradicting the local character .",
    "indeed let @xmath728 and @xmath727 witness that a morley sequence @xmath740 could be in @xmath726 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath729 is indiscernible over @xmath783 , and we may further assume that for some @xmath784 , the pair @xmath785 continues the sequence @xmath729 indiscernibly over @xmath783 .",
    "standard arguments regarding indiscernibility provide that @xmath786 .",

    ". then @xmath793 and @xmath794 .",
    "thus @xmath780 does not fork over @xmath232 , as desired .",
    "thus in particular @xmath795 if and only if @xmath796 does not fork over @xmath232 , i.e. , if and only if @xmath797 , justifying our notation . by earlier observations ,",
    "this is further equivalent to @xmath732 holding for all @xmath40 .",
    "it is further shown in @xcite that @xmath2 is supersimple if and only if @xmath798 is ordinal for every finite tuple @xmath15 and @xmath40 . moreover , in a supersimple theory @xmath2 , @xmath721 ranks characterise independence : @xmath799 if and only if @xmath800 for all @xmath40 .",
    "since our global ranks depend ( inevitably ) on a metric resolution parameter @xmath134 we may only hope to characterise genericity in case the metric is invariant under the group action , i.e. , if the action of each @xmath507 on @xmath485 is an isometry .",
    "assume @xmath483 is a type - definable transitive group action in a stable theory @xmath2 , @xmath493 generic over a set @xmath30 , @xmath802 satisfying @xmath803 . then there is @xmath507 , @xmath804 such that @xmath805 .",

    "then @xmath808 is generic over @xmath809 , so @xmath810 by standard independence calculus we obtain @xmath811 . since the action is transitive we can find @xmath538 such that @xmath812 , and we may take it so that @xmath813",
    ". then @xmath469 is generic over @xmath814 , and so is @xmath628 , and in particular @xmath815 . then @xmath816 is generic over @xmath817 as required .",
