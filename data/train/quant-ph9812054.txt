    "in a remarkable paper , berry et .",
    "al.@xcite clarified the way in which a curl - free magnetic vector potential modifies the wavefront structure of an electronic wavefunction that obeys the non relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "they concluded that for electrons travelling outside an infinitely long cylinder enclosing a magnetic field , the wavefronts outside the cylinder would be dislocated by an amount proportional to the amount of magnetic flux within the cylinder .",
    "reasoning by analogy , they also concluded that such dislocated wavefronts should occur for surface water waves when they encounter a vortex .",
    "a simple experiment conclusively demonstrated this effect@xcite .    in the case of the electronic wavefunction interacting with a confined magnetic field ( and its unconfined vector potential ) berry et .",
    "al . @xcite also computed the complete solution to the schrdinger equation that , in addition to the dislocated wave , includes a scattered wave . trying to do this in the case of the water waves",
    "is however more difficult because the analogy between de broglie waves and water waves breaks down when pushing it into a quantitative statement .",
    "there are two essential differences :",
    "the first is that for an electron the appropriate boundary condition is that the wave function vanishes at the surface of the cylinder ; in the case of water waves , the waves of course penetrate inside the vortex and it becomes necessary to solve the appropriate equations not only outside the vortex but also inside , and match them with continuity conditions .",
    "the second is that the wave equations that govern both phenomena , although similar , differ in quantitative details",
    ". this paper addresses both these issues .",
    "the scattering of surface waves by vertical vorticity in shallow water was discussed by cerda and lund@xcite and by umeki and lund@xcite who discovered that a vortex may support spiral wave solutions .",
    "fabrikant and raevsky@xcite have studied the case of a fluid of arbitrary depth in a born approximation .",
    "the interaction between surface waves and vertical vorticity is in many respects similar to that of acoustic waves and vorticity , a topic that has been much studied over the years and that recently has been the subject of particular interest due to the possibility of using acoustic waves as a nonintrusive probe of vortical flows , both laminar and turbulent@xcite , much in the same way that x rays and neutrons are used to probe condensed matter structures , both ordered and disordered .",
    "most treatments , however , rely on a born approximation@xcite whose validity breaks down when a surface wave interacts with a vertical vortex with nonvanishing circulation , leading to a long range velocity field that decays like @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the distance to the vortex core .",
    "this is precisely the case that is studied in the present paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 derives the equations that describe the scattering of a surface wave by vertical vorticity in shallow water .",
    "we pay particular attention to the assumptions needed to derive those equations .",
    "section 3 has a reminder on the aharonov - bohm effect as relevant for the present discussion .",
    "section 4 presents the computation of the solution to the equations derived in section 2 .",
    "section 5 presents several illustrative examples and section 6 has concluding remarks .",
    "technical details are contained in two appendices . a subsequent paper@xcite studies the first order corrections to the shallow water approximation .",
    "we consider the problem of the interaction of shallow water surface waves in an inviscid incompressible fluid of uniform depth @xmath2 with a stationary vertical vortex .",
    "the coordinates are @xmath3 in the horizontal direction and @xmath4 in the vertical direction .",
    "the velocity and the surface displacement are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the equation of motion is@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ( uniform ) density of the fluid , @xmath9 is the pressure , @xmath10 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath11 = @xmath12 and @xmath13 the three - dimensional gradient .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath14 are @xmath15 at the fluid s bottom ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a horizontal gradient , at the surface .",
    "we consider a free surface and neglect surface tension , which is consistent with the shallow water approximation .    in shallow water",
    "the length scale for spatial variations is much bigger than the fluid depth @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , the continuity equation @xmath19 together with the boundary condition at the bottom imply @xmath20 to leading order in @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the length scale for space variations . inserting ( [ eq : neweq ] ) into the kinematic boundary condition ( [ s2 ] ) and using that , to leading order in the shallow water approximation @xmath23 leads to @xmath24 assuming surface deformations small compared to depth ( @xmath25 ) .    neglecting vertical accelerations with respect to @xmath26 ,",
    "the @xmath4-component of ( [ s1 ] ) and continuity of the pressure at the free surface yield @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the atmospheric pressure .",
    "substitution into the @xmath29-component of ( [ s1 ] ) gives , again in the shallow water approximation @xmath30    we will consider surface waves with particle velocity @xmath31 and surface deformation @xmath32 as small perturbations on a background flow consisting of a steady vertical vortex @xmath33 , with corresponding surface deformation @xmath34 ; @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes a typical value of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . substituting @xmath39 and @xmath40 into ( [ s8 ] ) and ( [ s9 ] ) leads , to leading order in the small perturbations @xmath41 and @xmath42 , to @xmath43 and @xmath44 these equations allow the computation of @xmath45 in terms of @xmath46 for the background flow .",

    "taking the difference between @xmath54 of eqn .",
    "( [ s15 ] ) and @xmath2 times eqn .",
    "( [ s17 ] ) leads to @xmath55 + 2h(\\partial_i u_j)(\\partial_j u_i ) , \\label{eqpb}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the phase velocity of shallow water waves .",
    "we consider the case @xmath57 . in analogy with gas dynamics , we call @xmath58 the mach number .",
    "we denote a typical length scale of the vortex by @xmath59 , and the wavelength and frequency of shallow water waves by @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "we will assume that wavelengths are small compared to vortex size@xcite : @xmath62 , ( @xmath63 )",
    ".    under these assumptions , the right hand side of ( [ eqpb ] ) will be o(@xmath64 ) or o(@xmath65 ) compared with the left hand side . neglecting these terms ,",
    "the final equation to be solved is @xmath66 note that one might be tempted to neglect @xmath67 with respect to @xmath68 on the grounds that @xmath69 .",
    "however , it is possible to have @xmath70 without violating this small mach number assumption by considering ( as we do in section 4 below ) a background velocity @xmath71 with length scale @xmath59 and frequency scale @xmath72 , together with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the equation ( [ s19 ] ) is readily obtained , under the same assumptions , in the diffusion of acoustic waves by a vortex @xcite .",
    "the physics is the same since acoustic waves and shallow water waves are both _ nondispersive _ , and the results of sections  [ sec : scattering ] and [ sec : examples ] are valid for both types of waves .",
    "they depend only on two parameters , the dimensionless wave number @xmath75 and the mach number @xmath64 , and when those parameters are the same the results that hold for the surface elevation @xmath41 may be transposed , quantitatively and with no change , for the scattered acoustic pressure .",
    "the wave equation ( [ s19 ] ) posesses a close analogy with the quantum mechanical wave equation describing the aharonov - bohm effect , in which a magnetic vector potential influences the dynamics of a charged particle in a region where the magnetic field vanishes .",
    "this can not happen in classical electrodynamics@xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "this effect occurs when a beam of particles with charge @xmath76 and mass @xmath77 is incident normally on a long thin cylinder containing a magnetic field @xmath78 parallel to its axis .",
    "the schrdinger equation in the presence of a magnetic vector potential @xmath79 is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is planck s constant . outside the cylinder , @xmath82 , with @xmath83 the magnetic flux contained within the cylinder , and",
    "@xmath84 an azimuthal unit vector .",
    "of course , @xmath85 outside the cylinder .",
    "both equations ( [ s19 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) allow for a solution of the form @xmath86,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 in the fluid mechanics case and @xmath88 in the quantum mechanics case .",
    "this is an exact statement in the latter case , while in the water wave case it is approximate , because ( [ s19 ] ) is valid only when @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "except for integer values of @xmath91 , this is a multivalued solution .",
    "al.@xcite showed how fixing this multivaluedness leads to a solution that is a superposition of dislocated wavefronts and scattered waves .",
    "this was achieved by solving the schrdinger equation ( [ a1 ] ) with impenetrable boundary conditions : @xmath92 at the surface of the cylinder .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions in the fluids case are continuity of velocity and of surface elevation .",
    "we now turn our attention to solving eqn .",
    "( [ s19 ] ) under these conditions .",
    "one important physical difference between the classical and quantum mechanical cases is that in the latter the phase of the waves can not be measured , while in the classical case it can .",
    "table 1 compares these two cases .",
    "as an example , we consider a scattering problem by a circular uniform vortex with vorticity @xmath72 and radius @xmath59 surrounded by an irrotational flow . using polar coordinates @xmath93 , the background flow is given by@xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the circulation . eqn .",
    "( [ s19 ] ) will be solved separately for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and the results matched with a continuity condition .    inside the vortex",

    "thus we have @xmath108 , \\label{v4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath109 are as yet undetermined coefficients and @xmath110 when @xmath111 is an integer and vanishes otherwise .    outside the vortex , @xmath112 , the assumption @xmath113 reduces ( [ s19 ] ) to @xmath114",
    "\\eta_1 = 0 .",
    "\\label{v5}\\ ] ] inserting the form ( [ form ] ) of @xmath41 into this equation gives @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "we wish this parameter to be of order 1 .",
    "following berry et al .",
    "@xcite we write the surface elevation outside the vortex in the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 with @xmath119 , and @xmath120 the coefficients @xmath109 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are defined so that they denote the amplitude of the wave components at the vortex boundary @xmath123 . in order to obtain these coefficients , the continuity of @xmath124 and @xmath125 at @xmath123 is required .",

    "we require that the asymptotics of @xmath131 coincides with the dislocated wave incident from the right plus outgoing waves only .",

    "the second term in the right hand side of the equation diverges for @xmath149 .",
    "this is because this asymptotics is valid everywhere except in a narrow sector centered around the forward direction , @xmath150 , of angular width @xmath151 , where @xmath131 can not be separated into incident and scattered waves @xcite , and it does not make sense to speak of a forward scattering amplitude . this peculiarity was already pointed out by aharonov & bohm@xcite in the case of scattering by a _ point _",
    "vortex .    also @xmath152 the sum of the last term of ( [ v16 ] ) and ( [ v17 ] ) is the correction to the aharonov - bohm scattering amplitude that comes from the matching of the surface elevation and of its gradient inside and outside the vortex core .",
    "berry et al . have calculated a correction for different boundary conditions .",
    "they consider the finite radius of the scattering solenoidal field , which is considered as impenetrable . in the quantum mechanical context ,",
    "the scattering is due to the magnetic field inside the solenoid , and in an hydromechanical context it could be a solid body rotating in a perfect fluid .",
    "their result reads @xcite @xmath153    since the usual scattering cross section is not defined in the forward direction , it is interesting instead to compare the difference in the far - field correction to the aharonov - bohm wave function ( obtained in the limit of zero cylinder thickness ) calculated by berry et .",
    "on the basis of schrdinger equation , and our own calculations obtained on the basis of the fluids equations .",
    "the general asymptotic form of the scattered wave @xmath154 is @xmath155 with a scattering amplitude @xmath156 given by @xmath157 in the following section , we will compare the correction to the aharonov - bohm scattering amplitude for a vortex , that is @xmath158 with the correction for an impenetrable solenoidal field , @xmath159",
    "the solutions we have obtained are parametrized by two dimensionless numbers : @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "that is , for a given incident wave , they depend on vortex radius and circulation as independent parameters .",
    "the mach number is related to @xmath162 and @xmath75 through @xmath163 . scaling radial distance with the vortex radius , @xmath164 , the analytical expression of the surface displacement",
    "is summarized as follows : @xmath165 @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 @xmath169 where @xmath170 .",
    "we have numerically computed the total surface displacement given by ( [ v27]-[v29 ] ) for several values of the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath75 . in order to approximate the series in ( [ v27]-[v29 ] ) by a finite sum",
    ", it is necessary to estimate their convergence .",
    "this is done in appendix b , where it is shown that @xmath171 is an absolutely and uniformly convergent series , and that @xmath131 and @xmath172 are both absolutely and simply convergent series . as an illustration , absolute values of the coefficients @xmath109 and @xmath122 are plotted in fig . 1 .",
    "since convergence of the series expansions for @xmath131 and @xmath172 is not uniform , the number of terms to keep in the infinite series depends on the value of @xmath173 . in practice",
    ", we compute the patterns of the surface displacement in the region @xmath174 $ ] by the finite sum of ( [ v27 ] ) and ( [ v29 ] ) with @xmath175 for @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178 , but we keep more terms , @xmath179 in ( [ v28 ] ) .",
    "2 shows the resulting displacements for @xmath180 and @xmath181 , and fig . 3 for @xmath182 and the same values of @xmath91 .",
    "the dislocation of the incident wavefronts by an amount equal to @xmath91 is clearly visible .",
    "the outward travelling scattered wave is also visible .",
    "note the strong interference patterns between scattered and incident wave .    another illustration is given in fig .",
    "4 , where we substract to the total field the dislocated wave . the scattered wave appears as an outgoing cylindrical wave , with a clearly visible dislocation in the forward direction .",
    "this is the part of the wave that _ does not _ decrease as @xmath183 , and that ensures single - valuedness of the total field .",
    "note that the representation is for an half - integer value of @xmath91 , and the scattering amplitude is exactly zero in the direction @xmath150 @xcite ; the comparison between the two figures clearly shows the exact compensation of the dislocation in this direction , because of destructive interference , to yield a single valued total wave field .    finally , fig . 5 shows the absolute value of the correction to the aharonov - bohm scattering amplitude , compared to the correction calculated by berry et al . for @xmath184 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath77 is imaginary for small negative @xmath185 .",
    "this induces very different partial amplitudes for @xmath186 and @xmath187 when @xmath185 is small .",
    "our calculations thus predict a forward scattering with a strong asymmetry , which increases with @xmath91 as shown in figs . 5 ( c ) and 5 ( d ) .",
    "this asymmetry effect is observed both in experiments on water wave scattering by a vortex @xcite and in direct numerical simulations of sound scattering by a vortex @xcite . as can be seen from the dashed curves in fig .",
    "5 , this asymmetry is absent in the calculation of berry et al . for @xmath188 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath77 is real for all @xmath185 and the scattering in the forward direction is much less asymmetric ( figs .",
    "5 ( a ) and 5 ( b ) ) .",
    "all calculations were performed using mathematica@xcite .",
    "we have computed the surface displacement due to a surface wave interacting with a vertical vortex in shallow water when the vortex core performs solid body rotation , the wavelength is small compared to the vortex core radius and the particle velocities associated with the wave are small compared with the particle velocities associated with the vortex .",
    "when the parameter @xmath189 is of order one or bigger , the wavefronts become dislocated .",
    "the scattered waves interact strongly with the dislocated wavefronts and produce interference patterns .",
    "the differential scattering cross section is strongly peaked along a direction at an angle with respect to the incident direction .",
    "this is in contrast with previous calculations of berry et al .",
    "@xcite in the case of quantum mechanical scattering by an impenetrable cylinder of finite radius . in the sequel to this paper@xcite",
    ", we will show that these properties roughly persist when the depth of the water increases .",
    "this is important because deep water waves are much more amenable to actual experiments .",

    "we gratefully acknowledge a grant from ecos - conicyt .",
    "in this appendix , we study the asymptotic behavior of the function ( [ v9 ] ) . to this end , we use the computations in the appendix of berry et .",
    "al.s paper@xcite .",
    "in order to avoid confusion , we use the following notations : our definition of @xmath77 is called @xmath190 , whereas the function used in @xcite is called latexmath:[$m_{\\rm old } \\equiv     series representation of @xmath131 in our work , whereas the constants for @xmath192 are noted @xmath121 .    solutions to our eqn .",

    "consequently , it is appropriate to take as a boundary condition at large distances from the vortex that the solution should approach this dislocated wave",

    "consequently , there will be an @xmath203 , such that , if @xmath204 , the difference between the two @xmath77 s will be smaller than any preasigned value .",
    "let us write @xmath205 the wave @xmath206 is the original result of aharonov & bohm @xcite , and represents the scattering by a _ point _",
    "vortex , hence the notation .",
    "the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) is interesting only if the last sum , @xmath207 , is small when @xmath203 is sufficiently large .",
    "we will see that it is indeed the case , and we temporarily drop it from the calculations .    we know that if @xmath208 then @xmath206 gives a dislocated wavefront plus an outgoing cylindrical wave .",
    "next , if @xmath209 we may write , @xmath210 where @xmath211 is an analytic function of @xmath212 , because it is a finite sum of analytic functions ( exponentials ) . also , it is dominated by the contribution from low @xmath185 s . for @xmath213 , @xmath131",

    "this is good , since it is just the dislocated incident wave .",
    "also , @xmath214 for all @xmath99 , including the forward and backwards directions .",
    "this means that there are no further contributions from the @xmath215 saddle point .",
    "this is also good , since the outgoing character of the scattered wave is preserved . on the other hand , @xmath216",
    "this is different from zero for all @xmath99 , including the forward and backwards directions and we have , outside a small angular sector around the forward direction , the following asymptotic behaviour at large distances : @xmath217 this result differs from that obtained by berry et .",
    "al.@xcite on the basis of schrdinger s equation .",
    "let us turn back to the behavior of @xmath207 at large @xmath203 .",
    "we consider the behavior of @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a fixed number .",
    "using the asymptotic expressions of bessel functions for large values of the index ( ref .",
    "@xcite , formula 8.452.1 ) , we have @xmath220 @xmath221 where @xmath222 means that we consider only the dominant behavior at large @xmath185 .",
    "an important point is that these expressions suppose that @xmath223 .",
    "the following study concerns simple convergence of the series @xmath207 , for a fixed value of @xmath4 , not uniform convergence valid for all @xmath4 .",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath226 , and that @xmath227 .",
    "we then deduce that @xmath228 @xmath229 and that @xmath230 @xmath231 so that @xmath232 for large @xmath185 .",
    "we have thus @xmath233 using only the very rough inequality @xmath234 , we can now conclude on the asymptotic behavior of @xmath207 at large @xmath203 . begining with ( [ rndepart ] ) , we obtain @xmath235 up to prefactors that we have dropped .",
    "the important point is that , indeed , @xmath207 is a very small correction at large @xmath203 , which validates the preceeding analysis . as a last remark",
    ", we insist on the fact that all calculations are done for a _ fixed value _ of @xmath4 , and that @xmath203 , at a prescribed accuracy , may depend on @xmath4 .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss the convergence of the numerical series ( [ v27]-[v29 ] ) .",
    "the simplest case is that of @xmath131 . in this case",
    ", the variable @xmath173 may extend toward infinity , and we fix its value in the calculations",
    ". therefore we can conclude only on simple convergence of the series , not uniform convergence . for large @xmath185 , @xmath236 .",

    "we then deduce the asymptotic behavior of @xmath245 from its expression ( [ v23 ] ) @xmath246 we have seen in the preceeding paragraph that the convergence of @xmath247 is extremely fast , which ensures convergence of @xmath109 . for @xmath248 ,",
    "the term @xmath249 takes the maximum value at @xmath250 for sufficiently large values of @xmath185 .",
    "then the absolute convergence of the sum ( [ v27 ] ) is guaranteed by the absolute convergence of the coefficients @xmath109 . since the support of @xmath171 is compact , this convergence is uniform .",
    "rather easily , we get that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath122 is that of @xmath247 , which converges very rapidly .",
    "let us introduce @xmath251 we have that @xmath252 , both being asymptotically of order @xmath253 .",

    "<S> when a surface wave interacts with a vertical vortex in shallow water the latter induces a dislocation in the incident wavefronts that is analogous to what happens in the aharonov - bohm effect for the scattering of electrons by a confined magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this global similarity between these two physical systems there is scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this paper reports a detailed calculation of this scattering , which is quantitatively different from the electronic case in that a surface wave penetrates the inside of a vortex while electrons do not penetrate a solenoid . </S>",
    "<S> this difference , together with an additional difference in the equations that govern both physical systems lead to a quite different scattering in the case of surface waves , whose main characteristic is a strong asymmetry in the scattering cross section . the assumptions and approximations under which these effects happen </S>",
    "<S> are carefully considered , and their applicability to the case of scattering of acoustic waves by vorticity is noted . </S>"
