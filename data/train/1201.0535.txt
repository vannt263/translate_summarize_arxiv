    "the mutualism is acknowledged as a fundamental process in ecological systems : it is an interaction between individuals of different species , from which the interacting populations have beneficial effects . like predation and competition , is now recognized as a consumer - resource ( c - r ) interaction @xcite .",

    "all the types of mutualism belong to one of the three general forms of c - r interaction : uni - directional , bi - directional and indirect c - r mutualisms @xcite .    from a mathematical point of view",

    "one of the critical aspects of the discretization methods is just the dipendence from this interval , the time step .",
    "since the time step should be selected only in relation to the characteristics of the problem under examination , it is necessary to choose a reliable discretization method that allows to make this transformation without any restriction on time step , as well as not to introduce artifacts , change the linear stability properties etc .. since , in general , these requirements are not satisfied from all the discretization methods ( see i.e. @xcite ) , in this paper is discussed the application of the non standard finite difference scheme @xcite to the system of differential equations discussed by holland and deangelis in the articles @xcite and @xcite . of this work",
