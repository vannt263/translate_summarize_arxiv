    "during last decades we see a large growth of scientific interest in study of the old extremely metal - poor stellar population .",
    "search for stars of first generations in galaxy is a key program at largest telescopes in world since chemical evolution of galaxy in whole is imprinted in chemical abundances pattern in atmospheres of stars of following generations .",
    "reconstruction of chemical evolution of galaxy requires an enormous number of highly qualitative spectra of metal deficient stars .",
    "we undertake to high resolution spectroscopy of old stars at the 6 m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ras .",
    "below we present some results .",
    "we have selected a sample of metal - poor stars to obtain their evolution status and detailed chemical composition .",
    "some characteristics of 4 first stars and model parameters adopted are presented in table[model ] .",
    "the spectra were obtained using the echelle spectrograph nes ( panchuk et al . , 2007 )",
    "permanently mounted in a nasmyth focus .",
    "nes provides a spectral resolving power of r@xmath360000 in the range 320010000 . a possibility to observe in uv",
    "was given thanks to creation of an echelle spectrograph nes with a camera from fused silica .",
    "nes works in combination with a ccd 2048x2048 pixels having a high sensitivity in a blue spectral range .",
    "the 2d spectra were reduced ( applying standard procedures of bias subtraction , scattered light and cosmic ray trace removal , and order extraction ) using the context echelle under midas ( version 01feb ) .",
    "to process spectra obtained with an image slicer the context echelle was modernized ( yushkin & klochkova , 2004 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for all the spectra shown in this atlas is higher than 200 .",
    "combined with the spectral resolving power , that allowed us not only to detect rather weak lines but also to study their profiles . to illustrate an effect of difference in metallicity , full spectra of 2 stars with significantly distinqished metallicity",
    "are presented in fig.[full ] .",
    "such a scale illustrates very well a role of blanketting effect .",
    "large details , balmer lines ( especially h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 ) , caii doublet , are clearly seen .",
    ".basic data and model atmospheric parameters of stars studied [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ relative ]    from comparison our results for the star hd115444 with data by westin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for overlapping elements we obtained systematic deviation about 0.1dex which is caused by using of different systems of oscillator strengths and models parameters adopted . for most of chemical elements we obtained typical for their metallicity chemical abundances picture .",
    "for example , @xmath6-process elements mg , ca , ti are overabundant for stars of low metallicity .",
    "for the first time an unique atlas of f  k - stars spectra of very low metallicities is produced .",
    "an atlas is produced for the range 35505000 with a high spectral resolution r=60000 .",
    "the lines identification was performed by the models atmospheres method .",
    "more detailed results will be published in a forthcoming paper by klochkova et al .",
    "the atlas in whole , w@xmath7 , atomic data and abundances calculated are available by web access to @xmath8 .",
    "a comparison of the spectra of stars may help in a search for new spectroscopic criteria to distinguish metal deficient stars . in this connection",
    "several spectroscopic features are particularly interesting",
    ". such spectra could be useful for studies both of the chemical abundances of separate stars and determination their evolution stages .",
    "the atlas provides a spectral library for population synthesis . besides a large number of spectral lines sufficient for calculation of numerous elements abundances ,",
    "a short wavelengths range has another advantage in task of chemical composition determination . for temperature and pressure values typical for subdwarf atmospheres",
    "a coefficient of extintion in continuum near 4000 is lower about 0.2dex than in red part of spectra .",
    "it means that continuum extintion arises deeper in atmosphere than that in red range ( near 6000 ) .",
    "therefore , weak short wavelengths lines are formed in average closer to photosphere than longer wavelengths lines .",
    "it permits to hope that a model description of short wavelengths line is more accurate than the longer wavelengths lines .",
    "our work was supported by the russian foundation for basic research ( project 050790087b ) and the russian federal program `` observational manifestations of evolution of chemical abundances of stars and galaxy '' ."
