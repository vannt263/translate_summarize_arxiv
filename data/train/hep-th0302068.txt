    "in the case of the rindler , schwarzschild and de sitter metrics ( for which a thermodynamical interpretation can be provided ) , one can introduce@xcite a set of coordinates @xmath7 which covers the entire spacetime manifold and another set of coordinates @xmath8 which covers only part of the manifold .",
    "the metric is static with respect to @xmath9 since it is associated with a killing symmetry of the spacetime . under the euclidean extension of @xmath10",
    ", the resulting metric should exhibit periodicity in terms of the euclidean time coordinate @xmath11 leading to a non - zero temperature .",
    "for example , let us consider the case of flat spacetime represented in minkowski and rindler coordinates .",
    "since the transformation between @xmath12 and @xmath10 in the case of many other spacetimes ( like schwarzschild , de sitter etc ) has identical structure when the spacetime is embedded in higher dimension@xcite , the results obtained in the case of minkowski and rindler frames can be easily translated to other cases . in the case of the inertial ( @xmath13 ) and rindler ( @xmath14 ) coordinates , related by the transformation @xmath15 @xmath16 in the region @xmath17",
    ", the line element is @xmath18 the euclidean version of the transformation between ( @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath20 ) is given by @xmath21 which is the standard transformation connecting cartesian and polar coordinates .",
    "the euclidean metric , @xmath22 however , will have a conical singularity unless the coordinate @xmath23 has a periodicity @xmath24 ; this leads to the thermal effects .    the transformations ( [ rindlering ] ) between the euclidean versions of @xmath12 and @xmath10 has some curious features which needs to be stressed :    \\(i ) consider a parametrised curve ( @xmath25 ) in the inertial frame and its mapping under euclidean extension .",
    "in general , such a curve will not map to real values under the transformation ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "( a simple example is the straight line @xmath26 , which goes over to @xmath27 ; this can not be expressed in a _",
    "real _ @xmath28 plane . )",
    "even when it is possible to represent a curve in both minkowski and euclidean sectors , its topological nature as well as range can vary significantly .",

    "hyperbola , given in parametric form as @xmath38 .",
    "on analytically continuing in both @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we get @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",

    "the key new feature is the analytic continuation in the parameter @xmath40 as well .",
    "\\(iii ) the above result translates to the following feature in the transformation between inertial and rindler coordinates .",
    "the transformations in ( [ rindlering ] ) with @xmath47 covers _ only _ the right hand wedge [ @xmath48 of the lorentzian sector ; one needs to take @xmath49 to cover the left hand wedge [ @xmath50 .",

    "thus the euclidean sector `` knows '' about the region beyond the horizon ( the left wedge ) even though @xmath51 .",
    "\\(iv ) the left half of the circle can arise purely from the part of the hyperbola in the _ right wedge _ corresponding to @xmath57 and it is _ not _ necessary to introduce the hyperbola in the left wedge to get the left half of the circle .",
    "more generally , all the events @xmath58 [ where @xmath59 which correspond to _ different _ values of @xmath39 and @xmath33 will be mapped to the _ same _ point in the euclidean space . thus the circle in figure ( [ fig : rindlerfigsb ] ) is traversed several times as one moves along the hyperbola in figure ( [ fig : rindlerfigsa ] ) .",
    "( iv ) the light cones of the inertial frame @xmath60 are mapped into the horizon @xmath61 in the rindler frame and to the origin of the figure ( [ fig : rindlerfigsb ] ) in the @xmath28 plane . the region  inside \"",

    "the shaded regions in figure [ fig : rindlerfigsa ] maps to the corresponding shaded regions in this figure . in particular , the range @xmath69 with @xmath51 can cover the @xmath53 wedge of the minkowski coordinate . ]",
    "since the horizon @xmath61 [ or @xmath60 ] plays an important role in the thermodynamics of the spacetime , it is natural to explore whether one can attribute any special properties to the origin in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "one could , for example , take the point of view that since the region bounded by the horizon is inaccessible to the rindler observer , the origin should be removed from the euclidean spacetime .",
    "this will change the topological structure and will introduce a nontrivial winding number for paths that go around the origin .",
    "the thermal effect can be obtained directly from this feature.@xcite the conceptual difficulty with this approach is that , euclidean rindler coordinates are the same as the standard polar coordinates in a plane ; removing the origin is then like removing the origin from a two dimensional , flat , sheet of paper just because one is using polar coordinates . that hardly seems justifiable . at the same time",
    ", the economy and geometrical beauty of the above argument is so attractive that i shall provide an alternative way of generalizing and interpreting this result .    to do this , let us begin with a class of metrics of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an even function of @xmath73 .",

    "let us now confine attention to a subset of @xmath72 which are _ asymptotically rindler _ , in the sense that @xmath80 as @xmath81 for these metrics , when @xmath82 , the action is given by @xmath83 which is completely independent of the detailed behaviour of @xmath84 at finite @xmath73 .",
    "[ note that for @xmath85 but @xmath86 ; so , @xmath87 in ( [ actionval ] ) gives @xmath88 at @xmath89 but @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",

    "we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the acceleration of @xmath95 constant world lines .",
    "then , limiting the time integration to @xmath96 , say , the action becomes @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the induced metric on the two dimensional boundary @xmath99 . for metrics with @xmath100 ,",
    "the action depends only on the surface gravity of the boundary @xmath101 of @xmath102 .",
    "let us now write @xmath103 with @xmath104 as @xmath105 .",
    "since the result in ( [ actionvalue ] ) holds independent of @xmath106 , it will continue to hold even when we take the limit of @xmath106 tending to zero .",
    "but when @xmath106 goes to zero , the metric reduces to standard rindler metric and one would have expected the scalar curvature to vanish identically , making @xmath107 vanish identically .",
    "our result in ( [ actionvalue ] ) shows that the action is finite even for a rindler spacetime _ if we interpret it as arising from the limit of these class of metrics .",
    "_ it is obvious that , treated in this limiting fashion , as @xmath106 goes to zero @xmath76 should become a distribution in @xmath108 such that it zero almost everywhere except at the origin and has a finite integral . to see how this comes about ,",
    "let us study an explicit example .",
    "consider the class of two parameter metrics with @xmath109 .",
    "when @xmath110 this metric represents flat spacetime in standard minkowski coordinates ; it also represents flat spacetime for @xmath111 but now in the rindler coordinates . for finite values of @xmath112",
    "the spacetime is curved with @xmath113 [ only the component @xmath114 and those related to it by symmetries of the curvature tensor are non zero for this metric .",
    "] there is no horizon when @xmath115 . when @xmath116 limit is taken , we obtain the flat spacetime in minkowski coordinates without ever producing a horizon .",
    "but the limit @xmath117 leads to a different result : when @xmath5 , a horizon appears at @xmath61 . to study the properties",
    ", we use the limit @xmath118 valid for @xmath119 .",
    "[ a rigorous proof of this result can be found in ref .   and is based on the following theorem : if @xmath120 is a unit normalized function , then the sequence of functions @xmath121 tends to the dirac delta function when @xmath122 . ] in this limit , the scalar curvature @xmath76 in ( [ reqn ] ) becomes the distribution @xmath123 showing that the curvature is concentrated on the surface @xmath124 giving a finite value to the action even though the metric is almost everywhere flat in the limit of @xmath5 . in this limit",
    "we can introduce the minkowski coordinates both in spacetime and in its euclidean extension .",
    "the entire analysis goes through even in the euclidean sector , showing that the curvature is concentrated on @xmath125 .",
    "when analytically continued to the lorentzian sector , the curvature is on the light cones @xmath126 .",
    "thus , if we treat the rindler frame as a limit of a sequence of metrics with @xmath127 , then it makes sense to exclude the origin from the euclidean plane or the horizon from the spacetime .",
    "this will lead to a nontrivial topological winding number and a topological interpretation of the thermal behaviour.@xcite    similar conclusions can be obtained from another class of metrics : let @xmath128 where @xmath129 with @xmath130 being constants @xmath106 being an arbitrary function of its argument , subject to the condition that integral of @xmath131 $ ] with respect to @xmath132 over the real line is finite ( and equal to @xmath133 , say ) . in this case , the scalar curvature and the action [ in the notation of equation ( [ actionvalue ] ) ] are given by @xmath134 note that the action is independent of @xmath135 . in the limit of @xmath5 , the curvature goes to @xmath136 , while we can easily choose @xmath106 such that as @xmath137 , @xmath138\\ ] ] which is a rindler coordinate system for @xmath139\\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "an explicit example is given by the choice @xmath140 once again , if we treat rindler frame as a limit of a sequence of metrics , the scalar curvature is concentrated on the light cone and action is finite .    what we have done is to construct a class of metrics of the form @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a parameter , such that when @xmath2 the metric reduces to flat spacetime in some curvilinear coordinates .",
    "but , in the same limit , the curvature scalar ( as well as some of the components of the curvature tensor ) becomes a distribution [ like dirac delta function ] .",
    "calculating the curvature by taking the derivatives of the limiting form of metric , gives a different result from calculating the curvature and then taking the limit .    if @xmath143 in ( [ classofmetrics ] ) , then a coordinate transformation with @xmath144 will convert ( [ classofmetrics ] ) to ( [ startmetric ] ) with @xmath145 . the euclidean continuation @xmath146 ) of this metric when @xmath147 has the correct signature only for @xmath148 . examining the nature of the conical singularity at the origin",
    "we again conclude that @xmath23 is periodic and we can take @xmath148 ; in fact , this is again just the polar coordinates @xmath149 with @xmath150 . let us now consider a different metric with @xmath151 . for @xmath148 , this is identical to the metric with @xmath143 ; since the euclidean extension cares only about @xmath148 , the euclidean extension will again be the same ! however , for @xmath152 while for @xmath153 .",
    "thus the boundary condition at the origin in euclidean sector ( or on the horizon in the minkowski sector ) is what distinguishes the two metrics with @xmath154 or @xmath155 .",
    "our earlier analysis shows that the metric in ( [ startmetric ] ) with @xmath109 or the metric in ( [ classofmetrics ] ) with @xmath156 , provides a limiting procedure in which the @xmath157 is picked up .",
    "the fact that length scales below planck length can not be operationally defined@xcite makes this procedure particularly relevant .",
    "these metrics play an important role in the in the complex path approach@xcite to quantum field theory near the horizon .",
    "the wave equation for a scalar field near the horizon can be reduced to a schrodinger equation with the potential @xmath158 . usually , if the horizon is at @xmath61 , then @xmath159 near the horizon , where @xmath160 is the surface gravity .",
    "this will lead to a singular effective potential @xmath161 and one needs to dip into complex - x plane to obtain finite results@xcite .",
    "but for both classes of metrics considered above , @xmath162 with some constant @xmath163 , so that the effective potential reduces to @xmath164 near the horizon with @xmath5 .",
    "the poles of the potential are at @xmath165 and it is shown in the appendix of ref .",
    "that this regularisation of the @xmath161 potential leads to the correct thermal behaviour for the horizon .",
    "thus complex extension in either @xmath40 or @xmath73 possesses the same information and the same regularisation works in both cases .",
    "[ this issue is investigated fully in a separate publication ] .",
    "to provide some physical intuition into this bizarre situation , one may consider an analogy in the case of electrodynamics .",
    "in standard flat spacetime electrodynamics with vector potential @xmath166 , a configuration of the form @xmath167 appears to be a pure gauge connection with zero curvature .",
    "this result , of course , has well known caveats . if we take @xmath168 and @xmath169 , then the vector potential @xmath170 is _ not _ pure gauge and will correspond to a magnetic flux confined to a aharanov - bohm type solenoid at the origin",
    ". the line integral of @xmath171 around the origin will lead to a non - zero result , showing @xmath172 is non zero at the origin corresponding to @xmath173 in the cartesian coordinates . in this case",
    "@xmath174 . instead",
    ", if we take @xmath175 , then the same analysis goes through leading to an electric field confined to the light cone @xmath176 .",
    "this is seen most easily by noticing that , in the euclidean sector , there is no difference between @xmath6 plane and @xmath177 plane and @xmath178 will go over to @xmath179 as one proceeds from euclidean electrodynamics to lorentzian electrodynamics .",
    "consider now an one - parameter class of vector potentials of the form @xmath180 in the limit of @xmath5 , this vector potential reduces to @xmath181 $ ] .",
    "the electric field corresponding to the above vector potential has the form @xmath182 when @xmath5 , this electric field becomes a distribution concentrated on the light cone :",
    "@xmath183 thus , one can construct electromagnetic field ( curvature ) concentrated on the light cone by a suitable limiting process .",
    "this situation is completely analogous to the rindler frame example given above .",
    "the connection @xmath184 in ( [ vectorpot ] ) is analogous to the gravitational connection @xmath185 for the metric in ( [ startmetric ] ) with @xmath186 . when @xmath5 , this connection can be expressed as pure gauge ( almost everywhere ) , just as @xmath187 in ( [ vectorpot ] ) becomes @xmath188 .",
    "the @xmath189 in ( [ electricfield ] ) is analogous to curvature in ( [ reqn ] ) and the limit in ( [ elimit ] ) correspond to ( [ rlimiteqn ] ) . just as the line integral of @xmath171 around the origin",
    "indicates the presence of a non trivial field configuration , one can construct the line integral over the gravitational connection to probe curvature . in the case of asymptotically",
    "rindler spacetimes , the euclidean metric will correspond to that of standard polar coordinates in the @xmath28 plane at large @xmath73 . in this limit",
    ", the angular coordinate will correspond to @xmath190 .",
    "the line integral over a circle of large radius @xmath73 @xmath191 in the limit of @xmath192 indicating the existence of non zero curvature around the origin .",
    "just as the aharanov - bohm effect introduces non zero winding number in space , the concentrating of the scalar curvature in the origin of the euclidean plane leads to a non zero winding number in the presence of horizons and thermal effects ( as originally suggested in ref .  ) .",
    "since the topological feature arises due to a circle of infinitesimal radius around the origin in the euclidean case , the analysis should work for any horizon which can be approximated by a rindler metric near the horizon .",
