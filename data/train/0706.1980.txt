    "the acceleration of the universe is one of the most important problems in modern cosmology .",
    "an interesting approach to explain it is to modify gravity at very large distances .",
    "one of the most studied examples of a modified gravity model is the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) brane - world model  @xcite . in this model",
    ", there exits a self - accelerating ( sa ) solution in which the universe undergoes an exponential expansion without introducing a cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "however , this branch contains a ghost in the spectrum at the quadratic order  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that a perturbative argument is not conclusive because the brane is in a strongly coupled regime in this branch , and it is not clear that this implies an instability ( see also the recent analysis of nonlinearities in a cosmological background given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there is some indication that the sa branch is pathological at the nonperturbative level  @xcite , coming from the known exact solutions for domain walls  @xcite and point - like sources  @xcite localized on the brane ( although the bulk solution is not known in the latter case ) . in both cases ,",
    "the effective gravitational mass ( or tension ) of the source is negative from the five dimensional point of view , which might signal an instability in the full nonlinear theory .",
    "this raises a number of interesting questions .",
    "if the sa branch contains a ghost instability at nonperturbative level , then we are naturally lead to ask what does this solution decay to .",
    "is it possible to have transitions from one branch to the other ? this is what we shall address in this paper , with the hope that it can shed some light on the presence of ghosts in the sa solution and the question to what extent they are harmful .    the 5d action describing the dgp model is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the brane tension and @xmath3 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "we assume @xmath4 symmetry across the brane , and above we omitted the matter lagrangian .",
    "this model has two very interesting features .",
    "the first is that gravity becomes five dimensional at distances larger than the crossover scale @xmath5 the other is that for generic sources , it allows two branches .",
    "for example , considering only the brane tension @xmath2 , the flat frw solutions can take two different values of hubble parameter on the brane given by  @xcite @xmath6 with @xmath7 where @xmath8 is quarter the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the brane in the respective branches .",
    "the difference between the two branches can be visualized ( for @xmath9 ) as the different embeddings of the brane . in both solutions ,",
    "the brane is a 4d de sitter hyperboloid in the 5d minkowski spacetime .",
    "for the conventional ( self - accelerating ) branch , the bulk is identified as the interior ( exterior ) of the hyperboloid .",
    "the sa solution is the one with the larger hubble rate , @xmath10 .",
    "it is phenomenologically interesting that the hubble parameter at late times in the sa branch approaches a constant @xmath11 even for vanishing @xmath2 , mimicking a cosmological constant  @xcite .    as has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the sa universe contains a ghost . for a positive tension ( @xmath12 ) ,",
    "one has a spin-2 graviton having mass in the range @xmath13 and its helicity-0 excitation is a ghost  @xcite . on the other hand , for a negative tension brane ( @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the spin-0 mode becomes a ghost . in the sa universe ( @xmath15 ) , the spin-0 mode and a helicity-0 excitation of the spin-2 mode mix and a ghost arises from the mixing  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the ghost can not be removed even in the presence of the second brane in the bulk due to the correlation between spin-0 and spin-2 ghosts  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the conventional branch of solutions does not contain ghosts , though it does not self - inflate .    having a ghost in the spectrum for the sa universe",
    ", one expects that it is unstable to spontaneous particle creation out of the vacuum or to some even more dramatic process . in this article",
    ", we try to go one step further in the analysis of the stability of the sa branch by considering nonperturbative decay channels . since the conventional branch solution is stable , it is tempting to think that the sa solution decays into the conventional branch solution . here",
    "we shall consider the nucleation of bubbles of the conventional branch in the environment of the sa branch .",
    "this would resemble a kind of false vacuum decay in de sitter space .",
    "false vacuum decay is described by an instanton which is a classical solution in an euclidean time connecting initial and final configurations . in our case",
    ", we are interested in a solution that interpolates between the sa and the conventional branches  @xcite .",
    "we shall see that in the thin wall approximation , there exists a solution similar to the coleman de luccia instanton  @xcite describing this process . unlike the bubble of nothing  @xcite , mediating the decay of the kaluza - klein vacuum",
    ", the bubbles do not occur spontaneously in the gravitational sector in the dgp model .",
    "rather , a material wall separating the two phases is required for the instanton to exist .",
    "the second part of this paper is dedicated to show that this solution can not be recovered as a limit of any microscopic model of the bubble based on a scalar field .",
    "we interpret this as an indication that the thin wall instanton is unphysical .",
    "hence , the sa branch does not decay nucleating bubbles of the conventional branch . in section [ sec : disc ] , we comment on other possible decay channels .",
    "let us construct the instanton representing a bubble of the conventional branch in the background of the sa branch .",

    "this is the only possible configuration compatible with the profile of @xmath95 shown in upper panel of fig .",
    "3 .    in summary ,",
    "the argument for the absence of branch - changing solutions consists of two observations .",
    "the first is that , in order to join the two branches , @xmath96 must have a minimum at @xmath76 .",
    "the second is that a minimum in @xmath96 is only compatible with the equations of motion if we stay on the conventional branch around the minimum .",
    "it is instructive to compare this situation to what we would find in gr under the assumption that @xmath96 has a minimum . by the conservation equation ( [ conservation ] ) , one also concludes that @xmath83 has a minimum . in gr",
    ", we would not have eq ( [ zdot ] ) , and @xmath97 in eq .  ( [ r ] ) would be replaced by @xmath98 .",
    "since this is always increasing in @xmath67 , it follows by the same argument that a minimum in @xmath83 would be incompatible with eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) ( irrespective of the value of @xmath67 at the minimum ) .",
    "hence , the reason why one can obtain a minimum in dgp for the conventional branch relies on the very peculiar property that @xmath99 in the range @xmath100 . the hubble rate in the closed frw universe is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the energy density .",
    "hence , in this range @xmath103 increases with decreasing the energy density @xmath102 , which is a manifestation of anti - gravity .",
    "this is expected since for very low densities gravity in dgp behaves as in 5d , where the sign of the effective newton constant is reversed for @xmath104 .",
    "the obstruction to find a minimum arises because eq .",
    "enforces that the signs of @xmath82 and @xmath105 are identical .",
    "generally , this relation holds if @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the analytic continuation of the pressure to euclidean .",
    "the energy momentum tensor on the four dimensional brane takes the form , @xmath108 . in the case of a scalar field , we have @xmath109 . as @xmath107 dominates in the thin wall case , the above condition @xmath106",
    "is approximately interpreted as the negative pressure of the bubble wall , which means that the tension of the bubble wall is positive . then , permitting the presence of a negative tension bubble drastically alters our discussion .",
    "in particular , it is not difficult to construct branch - changing instantons with a pair of positive and negative tension bubbles .",
    "however , a normal scalar field can not support a negative tension bubble .",
    "the only way to incorporate a negative tension bubble using a scalar field model is to flip the overall sign of its action , _",
    "i.e. _ to introduce a ghost . in general",
    ", it seems that the negative tension bubble requires the presence of an additional ghost matter sector .",
    "therefore we shall not pursue this direction here .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion on the nucleation of pairs of ghost and normal domain walls . )",
    "in summary , we have studied the possibility to construct an @xmath0 invariant instanton that describes the nucleation of bubbles of the conventional branch in the self - accelerating ( sa ) universe .",
    "we found that this is impossible unless there is a material bubble wall which induces the transition . introducing the bubble wall tension",
    ", one can find an instanton in the thin wall limit .",
    "however , we showed that it is impossible to construct this instanton in a scalar field model of the wall .",
    "the reason is that at the point where the two branches are connected , the equations of motion can not be integrated in the sa branch .",
    "it immediately follows that the thin wall instanton is unphysical and that transitions between the two branches can not happen ( at least with @xmath0 symmetry ) .",
    "we should emphasize that the obstruction to have the solution is not due to the impossibility to embed the brane in such a way that the bulk is the exterior of the brane on one side of the wall and the interior on the other with a ` false ' vacuum with positive cosmological constant ( cc ) and a ` true ' vacuum with negative cc ( but larger than @xmath76 ) .",
    "then , true vacuum bubbles solutions within the same branch can form . for the conventional branch , the instanton looks like fig .  1 with the bulk being the complement of what is shown there , so that the bulk corresponds the interior or the exterior of the brane in either side of the bubble wall . ] .",
    "instead , it is a direct consequence of the equivalent of the null energy condition ( @xmath106 ) , which is satisfied in a scalar model of the bubble .",
    "let us now give a few comments on the interpretation of our results .",
    "+ _ bubbles in the ` @xmath110-lagrangian ' _ + it is also useful to analyze the bubble configurations in terms of the effective scalar field lagrangian introduced in ref .",

    "the most relevant non - linearities are encoded in the brane bending mode @xmath110 , and are described by the equation of motion @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the trace of the stress tensor of @xmath65 . in this treatment ,",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath65 is the same as in flat space . in the absence of the brane tension ,",
    "the conventional branch is @xmath114 and the sa branch is @xmath115 .",
    "one expects that analog of the thin wall instanton of sec .",
    "ii is @xmath116 where we introduced the ` rindler ' coordinate @xmath117 . inside the hyperboloid at @xmath118",
    "there is the conventional branch and outside the sa branch .",
    "clearly , the only nontrivial step to check whether this is a solution of eq .   is to see what happens on the hyperboloid . assuming that @xmath110 depends only on @xmath119 , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "is rewritten as @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "hence , the singular term at @xmath118 on the left - hand side has a distributional form like @xmath122 ( and it is proportional to @xmath123 ) .",
    "this means that the configuration can not be sourced by a simple @xmath124-function .",
    "in fact , integrating around the bubble wall , one obtains @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "given that @xmath127 in the sa branch , this is identically zero !",
    "this does not mean that this is a ` vacuum ' ( no source ) solution , but rather that the total tension of the source vanishes , as would happen for example in a system of two walls with opposite tensions .",
    "the fact that the two terms in the previous equation cancel out is the remnant of the cancellation between the terms linear in @xmath128 on the left - hand side of eq .  . recall that these terms originate from the intrinsic curvature and the extrinsic curvature , respectively . in the exact solution",
    ", these terms do not cancel out at higher order in @xmath128 , and this is what allows to have solutions with a net bubble wall tension .",
    "hence , the @xmath110 lagrangian does not reproduce the relation between the deficit angle and the tension for the thin wall approximation .",
    "interestingly enough , it does reproduce the fact that , in order to have a branch - changing solution , one has to provide a negative energy density at some point .    _ strong coupling _ + if the branch - changing instanton existed , in principle there would be the concern of how good an approximation to the nucleation process it is , given that the brane would be at an infinitely strongly coupled regime at the branch - changing point .",
    "the de sitter invariant solutions are @xmath129 , with @xmath130 and @xmath8 given by , and represent the de sitter branes in the conventional or sa branch .",
    "the fluctuations around this background can be studied by plugging @xmath131 in , and one obtains that the coefficient in front of the kinetic term for @xmath132 is @xmath133 .",
    "hence , this mode becomes infinitely strongly coupled for @xmath134 , which is precisely the point where the two branches join , @xmath135 .",
    "one could expect that any perturbation would produce a large backreaction , so that the actual process significantly differs from the solution .",
    "however , even if the infinitely strong coupling is achieved at the branch - changing point , it may not prevent the solution from having a physical meaning .",
    "the present situation is quite similar to the violation of the wkb approximation in false vacuum decay . at the turning points ,",
    "the wkb approximation is broken maximally . however , in the description of the bubble nucleation , the time coordinate is extended from the real ( or the imaginary ) axis to the full complex plane .",
    "then the wkb approximation is violated only around a point , e.g. @xmath136 , in the complex plane .",
    "the situation concerning the strong coupling seems to have the same structure in the complex plane . therefore having a region with strong coupling",
    "would not render the analysis of instantons invalid .",
    "this issue clearly deserves further investigation , though .",
    "let us emphasize that our main conclusion that there is no evidence for the instability through the branch - changing bubble nucleation is not affected by these considerations .",

    "this suggests that this is not related to the perturbative ghost instability , for the conventional branch does not have any ghost mode .",
    "furthermore , if the brane tension is negative , one can have a similar instability due to the the nucleation of conventional branch bubbles in the bulk .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the decay rate was estimated as @xmath146 when the brane tension is small ( a similar instability was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite when the @xmath4 symmetry across the branes is not imposed ) .",
    "even though this process is suppressed , it represents a catastrophic instability if the light cone extends into the bulk forever in the past .",
    "however , once we introduce a cutoff in time , typically of order the age of the universe @xmath147 , the probability that an observer is hit by such a sa brane nucleated in the bulk becomes really suppressed .",
    "let us just add that one can also avoid this instability trivially by restricting to topology preserving configurations .",
    "+ _ taming the ghost ?",
    "_ + it is still unclear what is the consequence of the ghost instability in the sa universe .",
    "usually , the ghost leads to spontaneous pair creation of ghost and normal particles .",
    "once such a channel opens , lorentz invariance leads to a divergence of the particle creation rates .",
    "if we consider the situation in which there is a spin-2 ghost , we need to treat the helicity zero mode in a different way .",
    "otherwise , negative norm states appear .",
    "but if we take a different prescription for the quantization for the helicity zero mode , this procedure necessarily breaks de sitter invariance . when there is a spin-0 ghost , a similar phenomenon happens . in this case , the mass of the ghost is given by @xmath148 .",
    "but we know that there is no de sitter invariant vacuum state for a scalar field with negative mass squared . once de sitter invariance is broken , one may be allowed to consider the possibility that the non - covariant cutoff scale may arise due to the strong coupling effect .",
    "then the particle creation could be milder than the usual ghost in the minkowski background .",
    "further studies are necessary to verify this , but together with the non - existence of the non - perturbative instability , the ghost in the sa universe could be less harmful than expected . +",
