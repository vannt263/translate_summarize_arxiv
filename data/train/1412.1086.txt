    "several recent experiments @xcite have provided strong evidence for a dramatic change in the nature of the low temperature electronic state of the hole - doped cuprate superconductors near optimal doping ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , zero field photoemission experiments carried out in the normal state have seen evidence for a ` large ' fermi - surface for @xmath1 , consistent with the overall luttinger count @xcite , and disconnected fermi ` arcs ' near the nodal regions for @xmath2 @xcite . at high fields , quantum oscillations also reveal a ` large ' fermi - surface for @xmath1 @xcite , but a closed electron - like fermi - surface with an area that constitutes a small fraction of the entire brillouin - zone for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to associate the transition with decreasing @xmath3 at @xmath0 with the loss of a ` large ' fermi - surface and the simultaneous opening of a pseudogap .",
    "there has also been significant experimental progress @xcite in understanding the structure of the density - wave ordering at lower doping , which is likely responsible for the reconstructed electron - like fermi - surface seen in quantum oscillation experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will use these advances to motivate and develop a previously proposed model @xcite for the physics of the strange metal near optimal doping .",
    "we argue that the rich phenomenology observed in the underdoped cuprates is primarily driven by a transition between non - fermi liquid metals with large and small fermi surfaces which does not directly involve any broken global symmetry .",
    "all states with broken symmetry observed at low temperatures and low doping are not part of the critical field theory @xcite , but are derived as low energy instabilities of the parent small fermi surface phase .",
    "this diminished role for broken symmetries is consistent with absence of any observed order with a significant correlation length at higher temperatures .",
    "we will also construct a global phase diagram to describe the many phases and crossovers around the strange metal .    a quantum phase transition which does not involve broken symmetries",
    "is necessarily associated with a _",
    "topological _ change in the character of the ground state wavefunction .",
    "emergent gauge fields are a powerful method of describing this topological structure , and they remain applicable also to the gapless metallic phases of interest to us here . given the fundamental connection between emergent gauge fields and the size of the fermi surface , which was established in ref .",
    "using oshikawa s method @xcite , we are naturally led to a quantum phase transition in which there is a change in the structure of the deconfined gauge excitations .",
    "indeed , this describes a higgs transition in a metal , such as that discussed in ref .  .",
    "this argument is a general motivation for higgs criticality near optimal doping in the cuprates , which applies beyond the specific model considered here .",
    "we emphasize that we are using the traditional particle - physics terminology in which a `` higgs transition '' describes the breaking of a local gauge invariance .",
    "we are not referring to the longitudinal mode of a broken global symmetry , which has also been labeled `` higgs '' in condensed matter contexts @xcite .    the primary new motivation for the model of ref",
    ".   arises from our recent work @xcite analyzing the @xmath4-form factor density waves observed in scanning tunnelling microscopy @xcite and x - ray experiments @xcite . in this work @xcite",
    ", we argued that such density waves arise most naturally as an instability of a metallic higher temperature pseudogap state with small fermi surfaces described as a @xcite ` fractionalized fermi liquid ' ( fl * ) ; other works with related ideas on the pseudogap are refs .  .",
    "specifically , we used a theory of the fl * involving a background u(1 ) spin liquid with bosonic spinons @xcite : it is therefore convenient to dub this metallic state for the pseudogap as a u(1)-fl*. these results are also easily extended to a @xmath5 spin liquid , and we will consider this case in appendix  [ app : spiral ] .",
    "the presence of a small fermi surface without symmetry breaking requires topological order and emergent gauge fields @xcite , and so also a higgs transition to the large fermi surfaces at larger doping : here we provide a natural embedding of a fl * theory into such a transition , and we expect similar approaches are possible for other possible topological orders in the underdoped regime .",
    "we now consider the evolution of the u(1)-fl * , and its small electronic fermi surfaces , to the conventional ` large ' fermi surface fermi liquid state at large doping .",
    "there is an existing conventional theory of the transformation from small to large fermi surfaces driven by the disappearance of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this is a transition between two fermi liquids , and the vicinity of the transition is described by the hertz - millis theory @xcite and its field - theoretic extensions @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] .    .",

    "the detour is described by a su(2 ) gauge theory , and the transition from small to large fermi surfaces is now a higgs transition without any local order parameter , in which the emergent gauge structure describing the topological order in the ground state changes from u(1 ) to su(2 ) .",

    "[ fig : phase1 ] is between metallic states which we denote as ` algebraic charge liquids ' ( acl ) .",
    "the small and large fermi surfaces in the acls are those of spinless fermions which carry the electromagnetic charge of the electron . for the u(1 ) acl , a bound state forms between the spinless fermions and a spin @xmath6 boson @xcite , leading to small fermi surfaces of fermionic quasiparticles carrying the same quantum numbers as the electron in the u(1)-fl * : so photoemission will detect a small fermi surface of electrons in the u(1)-fl*. we anticipate that similar effects are also present in the su(2 ) acl metal : there is a large density of states of thermally excited @xmath6 bosons at low energy , so that the photoemission spectral function reflects the large fermi surface of the spinless fermions .    we also note that although the higgs field plays a central role in our phase diagram , its direct experimental detection will be difficult .",
    "it is overdamped via its coupling to the fermi surfaces , and gauge invariance prohibits any experimental probe from coupling linearly to it .",

    "the u(1 ) fl * phase also has an emergent u(1 ) gauge field , as required by the topological arguments in ref .  ,",

    "the recent remarkable observation of fermi liquid transport properties in the pseudogap phase of hg1201 @xcite below @xmath131 , with some possibly non - fermi liquid behavior between @xmath131 and @xmath132 , can therefore be viewed as strong support for the existence of a fl * derived out of a parent acl . in particular , the alternative ` fluctuating order ' picture of the pseudogap does not naturally lead to such temperature dependent crossovers from non - fermi liquid to fermi liquid regimes .    for the la - based cuprates , there is a larger doping regime with magnetic order , overlapping with the regime of charge order .",

    "such a coupling leads to a linear - in - temperature resistivity . also , as emphasized in ref .",

    ". also note that while the higgs field coupling does show up in the resistivity as discussed above , the gauge fields coupling has a weaker effect on transport .",
    "this is because gauge - invariance prevents a non - derivative coupling between the gauge field and perturbations that violate momentum conversation .",
    "an important open question is whether this rich theoretical structure can be made consistent with the complex experimental features of the conductivity and magnetotransport in the strange metal @xcite .",
    "our linear-@xmath25 resistivity is proportional to disorder , as in the previous model in ref .  .",
    "however , because the disorder couples to the higgs field , the relevant disorder is long - wavelength .",
    "this is in contrast to short wavelength disorder , which can lead to efficient large momentum scattering of fermions around the fermi surface .",
    "modifying the coefficient of the resistivity therefore requires modifying long - wavelength disorder , and this may be difficult to do because of the intrinsic disorder from the dopant ions . inducing short - wavelength disorder , by including _",

    "<S> we analyze a candidate theory for the strange metal near optimal hole - doping in the cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the theory contains a quantum phase transition between metals with large and small fermi surfaces of spinless fermions carrying the electromagnetic charge of the electron , but the transition does not directly involve any broken global symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the two metals have emergent su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge fields respectively , and the transition is driven by the condensation of a real higgs field , carrying a finite lattice momentum and an adjoint su(2 ) gauge charge . </S>",
    "<S> this higgs field measures the local antiferromagnetic correlations in a ` rotating reference frame ' . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a global phase diagram around this higgs transition , and describe its relationship to a variety of recent experiments on the cuprate superconductors . </S>"
