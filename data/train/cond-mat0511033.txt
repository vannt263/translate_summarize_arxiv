    "<S> in this work we present measurements of the electrical conductivity and of the magnetization of la and of la - pr and la - lu dilute ( up to ) alloys , from which we determine , very in particular , the influence of dilute magnetic impurities on the upper critical magnetic field amplitude [ and then on the superconducting coherence length amplitude @xmath0 and on the ginzburg - landau parameter  @xmath1 .    as it is well known since the pioneering experiments of matthias and coworkers@xcite , the la - pr and la - lu alloys are very well suited to study the different aspects of the interplay of superconductivity with magnetic impurities.@xcite however , even today some of the main superconducting characteristics of these alloys are still not well settled or even they have not been measured at all . </S>",
    "<S> this is , for instance , the case of a so - central parameter as the ginzburg - landau superconducting coherence length amplitude , @xmath2 . here </S>",
    "<S> we will present detailed magnetic and electrical measurements in la and la - pr and la - lu dilute ( up to ) alloys , from which we will obtain , very in particular , @xmath2 and the ginzburg - landau parameter , @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> all the samples ( pure la and la - pr and la - lu alloys ) used in this work are commercial ( goodfellow and alfa aesar , 99.9% purity ) . the manufacturers warrant that the impurity concentrations are below 100  ppm ( by weight ) for any of the following ions : al , ca , fe , mg , nd , ni , pr , si , and y. x - ray diffraction analyses revealed that the pure la samples consist in a randomly - oriented mixture of two crystallographic phases , double - hexagonal - close - packed ( @xmath3-la ) and face - centered - cubic ( @xmath4-la ) , which is a common feature in most of the la samples studied in other works.@xcite for the alloys , we indicate in the last column in table  i the average distance between pr or lu impurities , @xmath5 , obtained from the samples densities and nominal compositions . </S>",
    "<S> the values are between 12 and 19  @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> a first magnetic characterization of the different samples has been done through measurements of the field - cooled magnetic susceptibility versus temperature curves , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> some examples of the obtained curves are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements were performed with a high resolution , superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) based , magnetometer ( quantum design s mpms ) . </S>",
    "<S> for that , each sample was first cut as a cylinder of 6  mm height and 6.5  mm diameter , and care was taken just before each measurement of removing the possible superficial insulating oxide layer with sandpaper ( buehler , 600 grit ) and then immersing the samples in an acetone ultrasonic bath for several minutes . </S>",
    "<S> the external magnetic field applied in the measurements was @xmath8  mt , much smaller than the lower critical magnetic field amplitude ( see refs .  [ ] and also below ) . </S>",
    "<S> for each sample , the resulting magnetic susceptibility was corrected for demagnetizing effects through the ellipsoidal approximation and then normalized to the ideal value -1 at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> other details of these last measurements are similar to those we have followed in magnetization experiments in other superconductors.@xcite in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) the solid lines are fits to the experimental @xmath9 points of a gaussian distribution , @xmath10 $ ] with @xmath11 and @xmath12 as free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we will see below that these @xmath11 temperatures , that are summarized in table  i , are consistent with the transition temperatures that may be obtained from resistivity versus temperature curves . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 values , which are also summarized in table  i , provide a good indication of how much the structural and stoichiometric inhomogeneities at long length scales [ well larger than @xmath0 affect the normal - superconducting transition temperature of each sample . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting here that in the case of the nominally pure la samples their @xmath11 values are well between the ones for pure @xmath3-la ( @xmath13 k ) and @xmath4-la ( @xmath14 k ) , @xcite but no traces were observed of diamagnetic transitions near these last temperatures ( which would manifest themselves as steps in the @xmath15 curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a mixing of both crystallographic phases at lengths of the order or smaller than @xmath2.@xcite we note also that the @xmath11 values of table  i are consistent with both the experimental results of matthias and coworkers@xcite and the abrikosov - gorkov predictions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these last aspects will be analyzed in detail elsewhere .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ susceptibilidad ] we present measurements , corresponding to three of the superconducting compound studied in this work , of the magnetization under a constant magnetic field of @xmath16  mt and including temperatures well above the superconducting transition . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements may be useful , _ e.g. _ , to analyze the superconducting fluctuations above @xmath17 in these samples , as it will be reported elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> note that the absolute values of @xmath18 above the transition increase with the pr content but , for instance , in the la-1  at.%pr alloy the magnetization at 1.5@xmath19 is only around 5 times larger than the one of the optimally - doped yba@xmath20cu@xmath21o@xmath22.@xcite as for the @xmath23-dependence of these magnetization curves , they present a curie - like curvature , ressembling the one of optimally - doped yba@xmath20cu@xmath21o@xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed measurements of the magnetization versus applied magnetic field at a constant temperature above the transition ; however , the understanding of the resulting @xmath24 curves is complicated by the existence of an upturn at low fields , perhaps related to the presence of small amounts of inhomogeneities which do not affect the @xmath25 dependence.@xcite    to perform measurements of the resistivity against temperature , thin slabs ( typically @xmath26 ) were cut from the same rods used in the magnetization experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical contacts were made by attaching to the samples four al - si wires ( @xmath27 diameter ) with an in - line geometry by using an ultrasonic micro - wire bonder ( kulicke @xmath28 soffa , model 4523 ) . </S>",
    "<S> just before attaching the contacts the possible superficial insulating oxide layer was again removed with sandpaper and an acetone ultrasonic bath . </S>",
    "<S> the final resistance was typically 50  m@xmath29 per contact . the ac ( 34 hz ) current supplied to measure the samples resistance was 2 ma , and the longitudinal voltage </S>",
    "<S> was measured by using a lock - in amplifier ( eg@xmath28 g princeton applied research , model 5210 ) which has a resolution of 0.05% up to 1 nv . the main uncertainty in these measurements comes from the samples dimensions and is around 15% . a general view of the resulting resistivity versus temperature curves is presented in fig .  2 for some of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> the nominally pure la samples have a room - temperature resistivity ( @xmath30 cm ) and a temperature dependence comparable to the one of pure @xmath3-la and @xmath4-la samples.@xcite note also that the room - temperature resistivity increases monotonically with the pr concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 presents a detail of these measurements around the superconducting transition . by taking into account that the resistivity falls to zero at the temperature at which a superconducting path exists through the sample ( _ i.e. _ , when the superconducting volume fraction exceeds @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) the transition temperature obtained from those measurements are in good agreement with the ones obtained from the low - field @xmath15 measurements presented in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath32 , the normal - state electronic mean field path extrapolated to @xmath33  k , were estimated from the residual resistivities @xmath34 through a simple drude - model relation,@xcite and compiled in table  i. by comparing these @xmath32 values with the corresponding @xmath2 ( see below ) , one may conclude that all the samples are in the dirty limit . in the case of </S>",
    "<S> nominally pure la , this is consistent with the presence in these samples of a small amount of impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation time of normal electrons corresponding to those @xmath32 values are of the order of @xmath35 s.    other basic superconducting parameters were obtained from measurements of the magnetization against magnetic field at different constant temperatures below the superconducting transition . </S>",
    "<S> some examples of these measurements are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> these curves are , even in the case of the pure la , typical of type ii superconductors , in agreement with the earlier results of pan and coworkers@xcite which showed that even high - purity @xmath3-la is a type ii superconductor with a ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> for all the compounds studied here we found that the mixed - state magnetization is highly irreversible up to the upper critical field , @xmath37 . to overcome this difficulty in determining @xmath37 , the reversible magnetization was approximated as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the magnetization when increasing and decreasing the external magnetic field respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath41 curves present a linear behaviour over a wide region near @xmath37 , consistently with the abrikosov prediction for the magnetization in the high - field regime,@xcite @xmath42},\\ ] ] with @xmath43 for a triangular vortex lattice . </S>",
    "<S> for each sample , the solid straight lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 are the best fits of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mrev ] ) to the @xmath41 curves in the linear region , with @xmath37 and @xmath44 as free parameters ( for each temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath37 , presented in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) , show a linear temperature dependence in the interval studied ( @xmath45 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the obtainment of @xmath2 through the relationship@xcite @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties in the so - obtained @xmath2 values are of the order of 20% . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize in table  i these results for the @xmath2 of each sample . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath47 are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are almost temperature independent , and linear extrapolations to @xmath11 give the values of @xmath48 summarized also in table  i. note that in the case of pure la , these values are compatible with the ones that may be found in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ] is proposed a thermodynamic critical magnetic field @xmath49 mt for pure @xmath3-la and @xmath50 mt for @xmath4-la . by using the relation @xmath51 and the @xmath1 values obtained from our magnetization curves , </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath52 mt . we are not aware of the existence of previous measurements of @xmath1 or @xmath53 in the la - pr and la - lu alloys studied here . in fig .  6 it is shown the dependence with the impurity concentration of the obtained @xmath48 and @xmath53 values for all the samples studied . as may be seen , @xmath1 scarcely varies with the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities but it increases slightly with the amount of pr . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 seems to increase a little with the pr concentration .    in conclusion , in this work we have obtained the @xmath54 , @xmath2 and @xmath32 values for pure la and , for the first time , la - pr and la - lu dilute ( up to ) alloys . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting values are summarized in table  i. these superconducting parameters have a considerable interest , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , for further studies we are performing about the behaviour of the fluctuating cooper pairs in presence of magnetic impurities . </S>"
