    "currently , the most successful model of cosmology that we have is @xmath0cdm .",
    "it is constructed in order to match a wide variety of modern cosmological observations that have stunned the physicist community in the last decades . among them , there are precision measurements of anisotropies in the cosmological microwave background radiation @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillation @xcite , and type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "all these observations point out that our universe at present is dominated by a cosmological constant -dark energy- and there are about 5 times of some unknown nonbaryonic , dark matter , over the baryonic matter which is well understood by the standard model of particles .",
    "nonetheless , some objections to the @xmath0cdm model exist , both theoretical @xcite and observational ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus , alternative proposals have appeared in the literature giving rise to the idea that dark energy varies with time .",
    "scalar fields have attracted special attention , mainly quintessence @xcite , among some other alternatives @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a lot of interest in studying couplings in the dark sector species @xcite .",
    "this is in part motivated by the fact that until today we can only extract information of these components through gravitational interaction , a feature that has been dubbed _",
    "dark degeneracy _ @xcite .",
    "specifically , we can define the energy content of the dark sector , and in fact the dark sector itself , using the einstein field equations @xmath1 where @xmath2 comes from the observed geometry of the universe and @xmath3 from its observed energy content . in this sense",
    "the dark sector reflects our lack of knowledge .",
    "the easiest way -mathematically and conceptually- to accommodate these ideas into the observed history of the universe is decomposing @xmath4 in two species , dark energy and dark matter , @xmath5 but this decomposition is not unique .",
    "in fact , the dark sector could be composed by a large zoo of particles and complicated interactions between them . or",
    ", it could be even just one unknown field . to accomplish this last possibility we note that in the @xmath0cdm model the equation of state parameter of the total dark sector is given by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 index the dark matter component and the cosmological constant , and in the last equality we have used @xmath8 @xcite . in order to mimic this model with just one dark field",
    ", we must have @xmath9 .",
    "any fluid with equation of state parameter equal to @xmath10 will produce the same expansion history of the universe .    on the other hand , some string theory - inspired models of dark energy share the peculiarity that scalar fields , like the dilaton , couple directly to matter with gravitational strength .",
    "to have cosmological influence at present , these fields must be nearly massless , leading to long - range fifth - forces and to large violations of the equivalence principle .",
    "some mechanisms have been proposed in order to avoid this unacceptable behavior , as the damour - poliakov effect @xcite , in which the interaction is dynamically driven to zero by the expansion of the universe , and as the chameleon mechanism @xcite , where the mass of the scalar field has an environment density dependence , becoming very huge in overall high density regions , such as those in which einstein principle equivalence and fifth - force search experiments are performed .    in this work",
    "we follow the both lines of thought outlined above . to this end",
    "we consider an interaction lagrangian between a nearly massless scalar and the trace of the energy momentum tensor of the ordinary matter fields given by    @xmath11    this type of coupling has been investigated in a cosmological context in @xcite .",
    "this interaction has some attractive properties , the field does not couple to the electromagnetic field and in this sense is dark ; also , it does not couple to relativistic matter and then do not affects the success of the early universe cosmology , although it could couple to the inflaton field . as we shall see ,",
    "the coupling could also give mass to the field .    at a more fundamental level we can consider , in a first approximation , a fermionic matter free fields with energy momentum tensor @xmath12 and trace given by @xmath13 , where in the last equality we have used the dirac equation .",
    "the coupling then becomes a yukawa - like one and gives mass to the fermions .",
    "if we chose correctly the function @xmath14 we can also interpret this result as that the interaction has given mass to the field @xmath15 .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the details of the general theory ; in section iii , we derive the background cosmology equations and we choose a specific model that mimics the @xmath0cdm model , then we numerically obtain the cosmological solutions ; in section iv , we work the theory of linear perturbations ; finally , in section v , we present our conclusions .",
    "the action we consider is    @xmath16   \\nonumber\\\\ & & + s_{int } + s_{m},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the coupling of the scalar field with the trace of the energy momentum tensor of the ordinary matter fields is given by ( [ intlag ] ) .",
    "there is a difficulty here because the matter fields not only appears in the matter action , but also in the interaction action .",
    "thus , we have to define the trace of the energy momentum tensor of baryonic matter as    @xmath17    to solve this redundant definition we will be specific and we will work with a perfect fluid of dust in the matter sector , the lagrangian is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the energy density of the fluid in its rest frame @xcite . the trace of the energy momentum tensor becomes ( see appendix , or for an alternative derivation see @xcite )    @xmath20    then , the total action can be written as    @xmath21,\\ ] ]    where we have defined the function @xmath22 through    @xmath23    these theories reduce to those with an interaction term @xmath24 , proposed in @xcite , in the case in which the matter fields are perfect fluids , although the interaction vanishes for relativistic fluids ( see appendix ) .",
    "the field equations derived from action [ act2 ] are    @xmath25    where the energy momentum tensors of the fields are @xmath26 and @xmath27    for the scalar field the evolution equation is @xmath28 where prime means derivative with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "this equation shows that , as in the chameleon models , the evolution of the scalar field is governed by the effective potential @xmath29 , and that the mass of slow oscillations about the minimum is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the value of the scalar field that minimizes the effective potential . by using the bianchi identities",
    "the conservation equation for the matter fields becomes    @xmath32    from this equation we obtain the continuity and geodesic equations    @xmath33    and @xmath34    the geodesic equation ( [ geodeq ] ) shows that only the changes of the scalar field perpendicular to the four velocity of a particle affect its motion . in particular , if the vector field @xmath35 defines a global time , only the spatial gradient of the field influences the particle s motions .",
    "this is the case of the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology , in which there is a family of preferred comoving observers with the expansion .",
    "if the field is also homogeneous and isotropic , these observers are affected by the field only through gravity .    in the nonrelativistic limit with static fields , the geodesic equation ( [ geodeq ] ) for a point particle reduces to    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the spatial position of the particle , @xmath38 its three velocity and @xmath39 the newtonian potential .",
    "the last term can be dropped out because it is of the order @xmath40 , but we prefer to leave it there because it is a dissipative term that arises due to the interaction with the scalar field and it shows explicitly how the energy transfer occurs . equation ( [ wflim ] ) also shows that the force exerted by the scalar field upon a test particle of mass @xmath41 is given by    @xmath42",
    "considering a spatially flat frw metric , we write the background evolution equations as    @xmath43    the last equation is a consequence of ( [ consm ] ) ( see also the discussion after equation ( [ geodeq ] ) ) , and it can be integrated to give @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the value of the energy density of baryonic matter today and we have normalized the value of the scale factor today to @xmath46 .",
    "this set of equations is a general feature of interactions of the type @xmath47 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the conservation equation suggests to interpret the interaction as a pure dark sector feature .",
    "then we define    @xmath48    where @xmath49 .",
    "the total energy density is then @xmath50 , and the friedman equation , @xmath51 .",
    "the conservation equation for @xmath52 is    @xmath53    where    @xmath54    if the field is in slow - roll regime we neglect the @xmath55 contribution and the dark equation of state parameter becomes    @xmath56    then , the following cosmological scenario is plausible without dark matter . during the radiation era , the trace of the energy momentum tensor of the baryonic matter is equal to zero and the background cosmology is as the standard big bang .",
    "then , in the early times of matter era the energy density @xmath19 is high , and thus the interaction term dominates in the last expression , giving rise to @xmath57 .",
    "as the time goes on , @xmath19 is redshifted as @xmath58 , the potential becomes important and eventually dominates over the interaction term , and in this limit @xmath59 .    to obtain an acceptable late time cosmology we have to impose a set of constrictions in the free functions of the theory",
    "first , to obtain equation ( [ lcdmweff ] ) we impose the constriction    @xmath60    second , to account for the correct amount of _ dark matter _ , here given by the interaction term , we impose the constriction    @xmath61    @xmath62 and @xmath63 are general functions of the scalar field that we expect to have a very little variation in the slow - roll regime . also , to obtain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe",
    ", we must have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the value of the scalar field today and @xmath0 is the measured _",
    "cosmological constant_. note that this last equation is not independent from the two constrictions .",
    "the interaction over fermions impose other constraints because , as we show in the appendix , its effect is to shift the fermion masses from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "following @xcite the abundance of light elements constrains the variation of protons and neutrons masses to be at most of about @xmath68 from nucleosynthesis until today . in our model this is translated into @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the value of the scalar field at nucleosynthesis and @xmath65 is the value of the scalar field today . according to this the scalar field has to be in slow - roll at least since that epoch .      in the chameleon model",
    "the potential is of the runaway form and the coupling with matter is an exponential one .",
    "the effective equation of state parameter becomes of the form @xmath71 and the arguments shown above are applicable as long as the field is in the slow - roll regime .",
    "nevertheless we will follow a different approach and with the only aim to mimic as far as possible the @xmath0cdm model we choose the free functions of the theory as    @xmath72    and @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a constant with inverse squared mass units .",
    "note that with this selection the minimum of the effective potential is always at @xmath75 , and the evolution field equation for the scalar field ( [ efe ] ) becomes    @xmath76    and it is explicit that the field has an effective environment dependent mass @xmath77 and that the force mediated by the field has a range @xmath78 .",
    "although this is a feature on chameleon fields , the evolution equation here is linear and then we do not expect to obtain the thin - shell suppression @xcite , also a feature in chameleon fields .    the two constriction equations ( [ 1fc ] ) and ( [ 2fc ] ) become    @xmath79    and @xmath80    the equation that relates the scalar field mass with @xmath0 becomes @xmath81 where the reduced planck mass is given by @xmath82 .      with the selection of the free functions given in last section ,",
    "the cosmological background evolution equations can be written as    @xmath83    and @xmath84    to do the numerical analysis , it is convenient to define the dimensionless strength parameter of the interaction @xmath85    using @xmath86 , @xmath87 and equation ( [ 3nc ] ) , the required value of the scalar field mass as a function of @xmath88 and @xmath89 is @xmath90    we evolve the equations ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) for different values of @xmath88 , using the numerical constrictions ( [ 1nc ] ) and ( [ 2nc ] ) .    . the dashed line is the result in the @xmath0cdm model .",

    "in the last section we have shown how the background dynamics can be made very similar to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this is mainly because the background fluids are affected by the scalar field only gravitationally , see equation ( [ f1c ] ) .",
    "this comes ultimately from the fact that the right - hand side of the conservation equation ( [ consm ] ) projects out temporal variations of @xmath123 , with respect to the observer @xmath35 . in the background cosmology",

    "the results of the numerical analysis are shown in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "the dashed lines are the results in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "an interesting parameter is the squared of the effective sound speed of the perturbations of the scalar field , @xmath146 , @xmath147    for an uncoupled scalar field dark energy component , as quintessence , the sound speed is exactly one in the slow - roll approximation , preventing scalar field structure to form . in our model ,",
    "the scalar field acts both as dark energy and , by the coupling to baryons , as dark matter . as a dark energy component ,",
    "scalar field perturbations tend to be erased , but on the other hand the interaction drives to zero the speed of sound squared , due to the last term in the denominator of equation ( [ ss ] ) , allowing the scalar field perturbations to grow . as a result of this interplay",
    "scalar field perturbations are not completeley damped , instead initial scalar field inhomogeneities could be amplified or at least frozen .",
    "this behavior is shown in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , where the scalar field perturbations do not decay to zero as the time goes on , but they tend to a negative value about which they oscillate .",
    "the scalar field perturbations become a source of the gravitational potential ( see equation [ pe1 ] ) that acts upon the baryonic matter through equation ( [ pe4 ] ) .",
    "this is a feature of dark matter .",
    "however , note that the sign of the average of the scalar field perturbations is negative and , from the poisson equation ( 46 ) , they act as a repulsive gravitational source .",
    "nevertheless , the gravitational potential , read from figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , is similar to the one in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this is because the baryonic matter energy density appears multiplied by the factor @xmath148 in equation ( [ pe1 ] ) and it contributes as an attractive gravitational source . on the other hand",
    ", the scale factor grows at slower rate than in the @xmath0cdm model and this yields an increase in the gravitational perturbations through the second term of the left - hand side . of equation ( [ pe1 ] ) . as a net result of these effects",
    "the gravitational potential is slightly stronger ( @xmath149 more negative ) , and therefore the density contrast grows faster , than in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "these can be seen in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "as it was pointed out in @xcite coupled dark energy models could suffer from unwanted severe instabilities characterized by a negative speed of sound squared .",
    "this is not the case in our model in which the numerical analysis shows that the scalar field perturbations do not grow but instead oscillate around a nonzero value .",
    "a more detailed analysis @xcite has shown that these instabilities are suppressed when the scalar field is in the slow - roll regime , as in our case .",
    "it is possible that future observations and experiments reveal that there exist some interactions between the dark sector and the known fields of the standard model ; indeed , this is the hope for terrestrial experiments in detecting dark matter .",
    "the dark degeneracy allows us to study a wide variety of models that mimic the @xmath0cdm at today s observation accuracy but with a richer dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we have presented a plausible mechanism in which an interaction between a quintessence - like field and baryonic matter gives rise to effects similar to those of dark matter .",
    "the interaction is given through the trace of the energy momentum tensor of the matter fields , and in the case that we have considered , dust matter , it is the same as an interaction of the type @xmath150 .",
    "the differences are manifest if we instead use a radiation field , _",
    "e.g. _ photons , in this case the interaction vanishes -neglecting the trace anomaly @xcite- and in this sense is dark .",
    "because of this coupling the radiation era is the same as in the standard big bang and the differences appear once matter dominates .",
    "we have described the background cosmology and by fitting the parameters of the model we can mimic as far as we want the late time @xmath0cdm background solutions , from decoupling until today .",
    "specifically we have shown the differences for the cases of @xmath151 ( @xmath128 ) and @xmath99 .",
    "for this last value of @xmath88 , we made fits to the union 2 supernovae data set and found that the best fit is obtained by choosing the other two parameters of the model equal to @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "we have worked out the first order perturbation theory and shown that these models are capable to form linear structure without dark matter .",
    "initial perturbations of a free scalar field dark energy are erased because its sound speed is equal to one , and by the fact that dark energy accelerates the universe , it tends to freeze any matter perturbation .",
    "one of the effects of the interaction , when the field is slow - rolling , is to decrease the sound speed . in our model",
    "this induces the scalar field perturbations to oscillate about a nonzero negative value and yield a repulsive gravitational force over the baryonic matter perturbations .",
    "despite this effect , we showed that the baryonic matter density contrast could grow as fast as in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this is because the interaction enhances the gravitational strength of the baryons .",
    "this latter effect increases as @xmath88 does , but at the same time the increase of @xmath88 can break the slow - roll .",
    "thus , suitable @xmath88 are found for @xmath122 .",
    "in this appendix , we show how the interaction affects different types of matter , namely a fermion field and a perfect fluid .    for a fermion dirac field",
    "we focus on the microscopic interaction and we consider a fixed minkowski spacetime .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath154 , and the trace is given by equation ( [ tracedef ] ) , which now reads @xmath155 for a free fermion field , one obtains @xmath156 , where we have used the dirac equation .",
    "now , for the total lagrangian we make the ansatz @xmath157 , and inserting it into equation ( [ tracedef2 ] ) , we obtain that @xmath158 .",
    "so , the lagrangian now reads @xmath159      now , let us consider in the matter sector a perfect fluid with an equation of state parameter @xmath161 constant .",
    "the matter lagrangian is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the energy density of the fluid in its rest frame @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the trace of the energy momentum tensor depends only on @xmath19 , @xmath162 .",
    "it also depends on the metric , but only through @xmath163- .",
    "then @xmath164 . let us consider the action                      for dust , @xmath173 and this equation reduces to ( [ trace1 ] ) .",
    "for a relativistic fluid @xmath174 and the trace vanishes .",
    "this result agrees with the one obtained through an iterative procedure in @xcite .",

    "<S> we present a scenario in which a scalar field dark energy is coupled to the trace of the energy momentum tensor of the baryonic matter fields . in the slow - roll regime </S>",
    "<S> , this interaction could  give rise to the cosmological features of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we work out the cosmological background solutions and fit the parameters of the model using the union 2 supernovae data set . </S>",
    "<S> then , we develop cosmological perturbations up to linear order , and we find that the perturbed variables have an acceptable behavior , in particular the density contrast of baryonic matter grows similar to that in the @xmath0cdm model for a suitable choice of the strength parameter of the coupling . </S>"
