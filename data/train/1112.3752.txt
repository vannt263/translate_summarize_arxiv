    "the mueller - navelet jet production process  @xcite was suggested as an ideal tool to study the regge limit of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in proton - proton ( or proton - antiproton ) collisions .",
    "it is an inclusive process @xmath5 where two hard jets @xmath6 and @xmath7 are produced ( the transverse momenta of jets are much larger than the qcd scale , @xmath8 ) in the kinematical region where the jets are separated by a large interval of rapidity , @xmath9 .",
    "this regime requires large center of mass energy @xmath10 of the proton collisions , @xmath11 , since @xmath12 .",
    "it can be studied experimentally at modern high energy hadron colliders , lhc and tevatron .",
    "the bfkl approach  @xcite is the most suitable framework for the theoretical description of the high - energy limit of hard or semi - hard processes . at high @xmath10 , large logarithms of the energy",
    "compensate the small coupling and must be resummed at all orders of the perturbative series .",
    "the bfkl approach provides a systematic way to perform the resummation in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) , which means resummation of all terms @xmath13 , and in the next - to - leading logarithmic approximation ( nla ) , which means resummation of all terms @xmath14 .    in the bfkl approach , both in the lla and in the nla ,",
    "the high - energy scattering amplitudes are expressed by a suitable factorization of a process - independent part , the green s function for the interaction of two reggeized gluons , and process - dependent terms , the so - called impact factors of the colliding particles  ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the green s function is determined through the bfkl equation , whose kernel is known at the next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite .",
    "the impact factors of the colliding particle are a necessary ingredient for the complete description of a process in the bfkl approach and , therefore , to get a contact with phenomenology .",
    "the only impact factors calculated so far with nlo accuracy are those for colliding quark and gluons  @xcite , for forward jet production  @xcite , for the @xmath15 transition  @xcite , and for the @xmath16 to light vector meson transition at leading twist  @xcite .",
    "the d0 collaboration at tevatron  @xcite observed power - like rise of the mueller - navelet jet cross section with energy , though the d0 results revealed an even stronger rise than predicted by lla bfkl calculations . besides the cross section measurement",
    ", it was suggested to study a less inclusive observable , such as the decorrelation of jets in the relative azimuthal angle .",
    "the d0 experiment  @xcite found less decorrelation than predicted by lla calculations  @xcite .",
    "important improvements were made toward the description of the process within nla accuracy .",
    "effects related with qcd running coupling were studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite the full nlo green s function",
    "was implemented , but the jets impact factors were taken into account at the leading order only .",
    "recently the results of a complete nla analysis of the process  ( [ process ] ) were reported  @xcite , which incorporates nlo corrections to both the bfkl green s function and the jets impact factors , calculated earlier in  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite found that for kinematics typical of the lhc experiment the effect of nlo corrections to the jet impact factors is very important , of the same order as the one obtained from the nlo correction to green s function .",
    "this observation is similar to one obtained earlier in the nla analysis of the diffractive double @xmath17-electroproduction  @xcite .",
    "another important conclusion of  @xcite is that the results for mueller - navelet jet observables obtained within complete bfkl nla analysis appeared to be very close to the one calculated in the conventional collinear factorization at the nlo , with the only exception of the ratio between the azimuthal angular moments @xmath18 .",
    "in our opinion it would be important to have an independent calculation of mueller - navelet jet observables in nla .",
    "the aim of the present paper is the calculation of nlo correction to the jet impact factor in order to have an independent check of the results of  @xcite . in many technical steps",
    "we follow closely the method used in  @xcite , but we will take advantage of starting from the general definition for the impact factors at nlo , see  @xcite , which allows us to come to the results more shortly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will present the factorization structure of the cross section , recall the definition of bfkl impact factor and discuss the treatment of the divergences arising in the calculation ; in section  3 we give the derivation of the quark contribution to the impact factor ; section  4 is devoted to the calculation of the gluon part ; finally , in section  5 we summarize our results and make a comparison to the ones of  @xcite .",
    "the state of the jets can be described completely by their rapidities , @xmath19 , and transverse momenta , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the azimuthal angles of the produced jets as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is convenient to define the sudakov decomposition for the jets momenta . for a jet in the fragmentation region of the proton with momentum @xmath24 ,",
    "one has @xmath25 where we assume @xmath26 neglecting the proton mass and the longitudinal fraction @xmath27 is related to the jet rapidity in the center of mass system by @xmath28    in qcd collinear factorization the cross section of the process reads @xmath29 where the @xmath30 indices specify parton types ( quarks @xmath31 ; antiquarks @xmath32 ; or gluon @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 denotes the initial proton parton density function ( pdf ) , the longitudinal fractions of the partons involved in the hard subprocess are @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the factorization scale and @xmath37 is the partonic cross section for the production of jets , and @xmath38 is the energy of parton - parton collision . at lowest order each jet",
    "is represented by a single parton having high transverse momentum , and the partonic subprocess is given by an elementary two - to - two scattering .",
    "in the discussed mueller - navelet kinematics the higher order contributions to the partonic cross section have to be resummed using bfkl approach .",
    "such resummation at nla accuracy depends on the details of jet definition ( jet algorithm ) and will be specified later .",
    "a convenient starting point for our discussion is the case of inclusive forward parton - parton scattering , considered in @xmath39 dimensions to regularize the appearing divergences . due to the optical theorem , the cross section is related to the imaginary part of the forward parton - parton scattering amplitude , @xmath40 which is given in the bfkl approach at nla by @xmath41 where the green s function obeys the bfkl equation @xmath42 and @xmath43 ,  @xmath44 are the parton impact factors calculated separately for the cases of massless quark and gluon in  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the transverse momenta of the reggeized gluons , the energy scale parameter @xmath47 is arbitrary , the amplitude , indeed , does not depend on its choice within nla accuracy .",
    "in this subsection we review the definition of the impact factors in nlo .    both the kernel of the equation for the green s function and the parton impact factors can be expressed in terms of the gluon regge trajectory , @xmath48 and the effective vertices for the reggeon - parton interaction .",
    "is the proton momentum , @xmath49 is the fraction of proton momentum carried by the parton and @xmath50 is the transverse momentum of the incoming reggeized gluon . ]    to be more specific , we will give below the formulae for the case of forward quark impact factor .",

    "the sum @xmath53 is over all intermediate states @xmath54 which contribute to the @xmath55 transition .",
    "the phase space element @xmath56 of a state @xmath54 , consisting of particles with momenta @xmath57 , is ( @xmath58 is initial quark momentum ) @xmath59 while the remaining integration in ( [ eq : a7 ] ) is over the squared invariant mass of the state @xmath54 , @xmath60    in the lo the only intermediate state which contributes is a one - quark state , @xmath61 .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a7 ] ) with the known reggeon - quark vertices @xmath62 is trivial and the quark impact factor reads @xmath63 where @xmath33 is qcd coupling , @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the number of qcd colors .    in the nlo",
    "the expression  ( [ eq : a7 ] ) for the quark impact factor has to be changed in two ways .",
    "first one has to take into account the radiative corrections to the vertices , @xmath66 secondly , in the sum over @xmath53 in  ( [ eq : a7 ] ) , we have to include more complicated states which appear in the next order of perturbative theory . for the quark impact factor",
    "this is a state with an additional gluon , @xmath67 .",
    "however , the integral over @xmath68 becomes divergent when an extra gluon appears in the final state .",
    "the divergence arises because the gluon may be emitted not only in the fragmentation region of initial quark , but also in the central rapidity region .",
    "the contribution of the central region must be subtracted from the impact factor , since it is to be assigned in the bfkl approach to the green s function .",
    "therefore the result for the forward quark impact factor , see  @xcite and fig .",
