    "the quantum behavior of noninteracting tight - binding electrons on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice immersed in a perpendicular magnetic field has attracted much attention due to its important role in diverse areas of physics .",
    "for instance , the problem is intimately related to the quantum hall effect . during the past few years",
    ", the ground - state energy of this system has also been intensively investigated@xcite in connection with mean - field studies of the @xmath12-@xmath13 and hubbard models of high-@xmath14 superconductors . at half - filling",
    ", the absolute minimum of the kinetic energy has a half flux quantum ( @xmath15 ) per plaquette  called the flux state .",
    "in addition , there are local minima at flux values equal to @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "more recently , several groups have paid attention to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case : the kinetic energy of a 3d noninteracting electron gas under the influence of both a strong periodic potential and a magnetic field .",
    "for instance , for several rational values of the magnetic field , skudlarski and vignale@xcite analyzed the changes in the ground - state properties induced by the addition of hopping in the direction parallel to the uniform magnetic field .",
    "hasegawa@xcite studied the density of states and the total energy with the external field in the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 directions for certain selected rational values of the resulting flux .",
    "kunszt and zee@xcite showed that for rational values of the flux the eigenvalue problem can be reduced to a one - dimensional hopping in momentum space .",
    "they then calculated the energy spectra and the density of states for various selected rational values of the flux states .",
    "these three works@xcite focused on a _ discrete _ set of ( rational ) magnetic field values .",
    "here we are interested in obtaining results that are _ continuous _ functions of the applied field ",
    "valid for both commensurate and incommensurate flux values .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the isotropic 3d cubic lattice , namely , the hopping integrals in the @xmath21- , @xmath22- , and @xmath23-direction are the same and taken to be equal to one .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 refers to nearest - neighbor sites , and the phase @xmath26 is @xmath27 times the line integral of the vector potential along the bond from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . throughout this paper ,",
    "the flux quantum @xmath30 is set equal to one .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore conceptually different viewpoints and approaches to study this interesting problem .",
    "focusing on the hopping motion of electrons on the lattice , we first study the quantum interference between the phase factors of electron closed paths .",
    "this phenomenon is the source for the lowering of the total energy in a magnetic field .    in sec .",
    "ii , we examine the quantum interference effects originating from lattice path - integrals  defined as sums over magnetic phase factors on different electron closed paths .",
    "there , the physical meaning of these lattice path - integrals @xmath31 and the techniques we use to compute them are discussed in detail .",
    "results for @xmath31 in an arbitrarily oriented field of any strength are also presented .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the lattice path - integrals for several flux orientations by exactly summing an enormous number ( @xmath5 ) of closed paths , each one weighted by its corresponding acquired phase factor .    in sec .",
    "iii , we present an analytical calculation of the total kinetic energy @xmath3 of the half - filled fermi sea of tight - binding electrons .",
    "we use two different approaches : one based on a direct series expansion for the energy@xcite and the other on a moment expansion for the density of states.@xcite these two different methods yield the same results .",
    "moreover , they provide different insights into the problem . for an arbitrary field orientation ,",
    "analytic results for the total energy , in terms of the lattice path - integrals , are obtained .",
    "it is found that the lowest energy state is reached when the fluxes per plaquette on each one of the @xmath32- , @xmath33- and @xmath34-planes are equal to @xmath15 .",
    "we also show the variations of the total energy @xmath4 as a function of the flux , for various orientations of the magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , we obtain an analytic expression for the total kinetic energy @xmath6 for any filling @xmath7 close to one half .    in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate the magnetic moment @xmath8 and orbital susceptibility @xmath9 of this quantum system . for various flux orientations",
    ", we also obtain the zero - field susceptibility @xmath10 as a function of the fermi energy @xmath11 .",
    "we show that the magnetic response , in the presence of a strong periodic potential , is significantly different from the familiar landau diamagnetism .",
    "the zero - field susceptibility @xmath10 as a function of the fermi energy @xmath11 exhibits a large diamagnetic ( i.e. , negative @xmath35 ) response at very low electron filling",
    ". for increasing @xmath11 , @xmath10 increases and fluctuates around zero .",
    "paramagnetism prevails for large @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , the orbital response is paramagnetic at and near half - filling ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we obtain the field dependence of @xmath8which can be regarded as a generalized current in a multiply - connected geometry  and @xmath9 at half - filling , and both show oscillations between para- and diamagnetic behaviors as a function of the flux .",
    "the frequencies of these oscillations , as functions of the flux , tend to decrease for increasing field .    in sec .",
    "v , we summarize our results .",
    "the lattice path - integral of order @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the sum over phases of the bonds on the path @xmath40 of @xmath37 steps starting and ending at the same site .",
    "let @xmath41 denote a localized one - site electron state centered at site @xmath28 .",
    "it is not difficult to notice that @xmath31 corresponds precisely to the quantum mechanical expectation value @xmath42 , which summarizes the contribution to the electron kinetic energy of _ all _ closed paths of @xmath37-steps .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath31 ( @xmath43 ) thus becomes clear .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath44 is applied @xmath37 times to the initial state @xmath41 , resulting in the new state @xmath45 located at the end of the path traversing @xmath37 lattice bonds . because of the presence of a magnetic field , a magnetic phase factor @xmath46 is acquired by an electron when hopping through two adjacent sites @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath31 is nonzero only when the path ends at the starting site . in other words , @xmath31 is the sum of the contributions from all closed paths of @xmath37 steps starting and ending at the same site , each one weighted by its corresponding phase factor @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the _ net _ flux enclosed by the closed path @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath39 depends crucially on the traveling route of the path .",
    "for instance , @xmath39 will be positive ( negative ) by traversing a polygon loop counterclockwise ( clockwise ) .",
    "therefore , quantum interference information contained in @xmath49 arises because the phase factors of different closed paths , including those from all kinds of distinct loops and separate contributions from the same loop , interfere with each other .",
    "sometimes , the phases corresponding to subloops of a main path cancel .",
    "we will now compute the lattice path - integrals @xmath31 .",
    "this is a difficult task since @xmath31 involves an enormous number of different paths ( growing rapidly when the order increases ) , each one given by its corresponding net magnetic phase factor .",
    "we have considerably simplified this calculation by successively iterating the recursion relation and analyzing the symmetries of the problem .",
    "we consider a unit spacing for the cubic lattice .",
    "the vector potential of a general magnetic field @xmath50 can be written as @xmath51 let @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 represent the three fluxes through the respective elementary plaquettes on the @xmath33- , @xmath34- and @xmath32-planes .",
    "thus , a flux configuration is specified by @xmath55 .    from the definition of @xmath31 ,",
    "it is clear that : ( i ) @xmath56 obviously equals @xmath57 , ( ii ) @xmath58 are always zero because there is no path with an odd number of steps for returning an electron to its initial site , ( iii ) the @xmath31 s are gauge invariant , and ( iv ) in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath49 are just the total number of @xmath37-step paths on the cubic lattice starting and ending at the same site .    first , it is instructive to evaluate the first two lattice path - integrals .",
    "this will help clarify their physical meaning .",
    "for the two - step closed paths , and starting from any initial site , the electron retraces its first step on one of the six bonds connecting the initial site with its adjacent sites .",
    "this process can be designated symbolically by @xmath59 , where the dot ( @xmath60 ) indicates the initial site .",
    "the flux enclosed , of course , is zero . from these six closed paths of two steps each ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 where @xmath23 stands for the coordination number of the cubic lattice .    for the four - step closed paths , we need to consider four different possibilities :",
    "( 1 ) the electron retraces twice each one of the six bonds connecting the initial site with its nearest - neighboring sites @xmath62 ; ( 2 ) after retracing once one of the six bonds connecting to the initial site , the electron retraces two steps on one of the other five bonds @xmath63 ; ( 3 ) hopping first to one of the six adjacent sites , the electron retraces once one of the other five bonds ( the one connecting to the initial site is excluded ) and then returns to the original site @xmath64 ; and ( 4 ) the electron traverses either counterclockwise or clockwise on one of the four elementary square cells ( connecting to the initial site ) on the @xmath33- , @xmath34- and @xmath32-planes respectively [ @xmath65 $ ] . thus @xmath66 \\\\ & = & ( 6 + 30 + 30)\\,e^{i0 } \\\\ & & \\mbox{}+4\\,[(e^{ia}+e^{-ia})+(e^{ib}+e^{-ib } ) + ( e^{ic}+e^{-ic } ) ] \\\\ & = & 66 + 8\\,(\\cos a+\\cos b+\\cos c).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to compute @xmath31 in a systematic manner , we first define the quantity @xmath67 , which is the sum over all possible paths of @xmath12 steps on which an electron may hop from the origin @xmath68 to site @xmath69 . from the definition of @xmath67 , it is straightforward to construct the following recurrence relation for @xmath70 @xmath71 this equation states that the site @xmath69 can be reached by taking the @xmath72th step from the six nearest - neighboring sites .",
    "the factors in front of the @xmath73 s account for the presence of the magnetic field . by recursively using eq .",

    "( 4 ) as the basic recurrence relation in our iteration scheme . without loss of generality and for convenience ,",
    "we choose the origin @xmath68 to be our starting site .",
    "the initial conditions then read @xmath76 and @xmath77 for other @xmath69 s .",
    "it is evident that @xmath31 is just equal to @xmath78 .",
    "putting @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we directly have @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 using the above results for the @xmath83 s and putting @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we then obtain the @xmath85 s . in general , by following this procedure",
    "we can obtain @xmath78 to any desired @xmath86 .",
    "the properties discussed below will make the computation of @xmath78 quite efficient .    for a given @xmath86 ,",
    "a nonzero @xmath87 exists only on those @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 satisfying @xmath91 .",
    "this stems from the fact that only the sites @xmath69 satisfying this condition can be reached by an electron after @xmath37 hops from @xmath68 .",
    "the total number of these sites is @xmath92 among the @xmath87 s , we find the following symmetries hold for any @xmath86 .",
    "we omit the superscript @xmath93 below .",
    "@xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 we can therefore reduce our calculation to the @xmath97 s at sites @xmath69 in the first octant with @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the total number of the independent @xmath87 is @xmath99 for @xmath100 , where @xmath101 are non - negative integers and @xmath102 thus the number of the @xmath97 s to be computed is significantly reduced ( about a factor of @xmath103 ) compared to that of the whole @xmath87 .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to note that to obtain the lattice path - integrals up to @xmath104 , it is sufficient to compute the @xmath105 s for @xmath106 when @xmath107 is even and the @xmath108 s for @xmath109 when @xmath107 is odd . to be more specific ,",

    "( 24 ) with respect to @xmath11 , we can establish the following identity @xmath233 it is worthwhile to emphasize that the formalism described in this section is equally applicable to the 2d square lattice case .",
    "in this section we investigate two experimentally accessible observables , namely , the magnetic moment @xmath234 and the orbital susceptibility @xmath35 of this quantum system .",
    "it is well known@xcite that at absolute zero temperature @xmath234 and @xmath35 are given by the first- and second - order derivatives of the total energy @xmath235 and @xmath236 with our analytical results for @xmath4 at hand , equations ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) provide a straightforward way to study these important quantities for any orientation of the externally applied field . for illustration purposes , below we will focus on the following flux orientations : @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "it will be seen that the magnetic response , in the presence of a strong periodic potential , is significantly different from the familiar landau diamagnetism of a 2d electron gas , where @xmath237 has its largest value at @xmath238 and its vicinity and decreases _ monotonically _ as @xmath239 is increased .",
    "when we increase the electron filling factor @xmath7 , the fermi energy @xmath11 increases .",

    "large diamagnetic ( i.e. , negative ) susceptibilities are observed at very low electron filling . for increasing @xmath11 , the quantity @xmath237 decreases and fluctuates around zero . for @xmath11 larger than a certain value ( @xmath244 ) , paramagnetism prevails .",
    "indeed , the orbital response is weakly paramagnetic at half - filling ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the observations of skudlarski and vignale@xcite based on calculating the current - current correlation function .",
    "furthermore , note that the absolute value of @xmath35 for @xmath158 is always twice that for @xmath157 ; @xmath245 for @xmath159 is always three times that for @xmath157 ; and @xmath245 for @xmath160 is twice that for @xmath159 .",
    "these results clearly reflect the orbital origin of the susceptibility .",
    "we now focus on the system at half - filling and examine the _ continuous _ dependence of the magnetic moment @xmath234 and susceptibility @xmath35 on the magnetic flux @xmath165 . employing eq .",
    "( 20 ) for @xmath198 , we can directly obtain @xmath249 and @xmath250 the results for four different flux orientations are shown in fig .",

    ", @xmath254 is mostly negative for low fields ( @xmath257@xmath258 ) , oscillates around zero for intermediate fields ( @xmath259@xmath260 ) , is negative for larger fields ( @xmath255@xmath256 ) , and reaches zero at @xmath204 . at relatively large flux values ( @xmath261@xmath256 )",
    ", @xmath254 : decreases to zero ( at @xmath204 ) from a positive value for @xmath157 ; and increases to zero ( at @xmath204 ) from a negative value for @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "the field - dependent orbital magnetic susceptibility , @xmath262 , fluctuates somewhat evenly around zero in the low - field regime .",
    "however , @xmath237 fluctuates less , and around a small negative value for the flux orientation @xmath157 , where only one plane ( @xmath32-plane ) is penetrated by the flux .",
    "the fluctuations are more pronounced in the flux orientations : @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 , where at least two perpendicular planes are affected by the field .",
    "as the flux is raised , @xmath237 tends to fluctuate less and : ( i ) a crossover from diamagnetism to paramagnetism is observed in the configuration @xmath157 ; and , on the other hand , ( ii ) a crossover from paramagnetism to diamagnetism is observed in the orientations @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 . in other words , at @xmath204 , the magnetic response is weakly paramagnetic in the flux configuration @xmath157 , while the other three orientations provide a strong diamagnetic response in the lattice .",
    "figure  4 suggests that , for both @xmath234 and @xmath35 , the following four quantities tend to grow larger with the increase of planes exposed to the field : the number of oscillations , the frequency of the oscillations as a function of the flux , the number of nodes , and the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "for instance , @xmath263 oscillates more rapidly and strongly than @xmath264 , which at the same time oscillates more rapidly and strongly than @xmath265 .",
    "a similar general trend is observed between @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 .",
    "these features can be understood intuitively : the more perpendicular planes are exposed to the flux , the more strongly @xmath234 and @xmath35 will be affected .",
    "in conclusion , we present an investigation of quantum interference phenomena of tight - binding electrons on the 3d cubic lattice in a _ continuously - tunable _ magnetic field with _ arbitrary orientation_. previous work on this problem focused on a _ discrete _ set of ( rational ) magnetic field values .",
    "we study the total kinetic energy , and subsequently the magnetic moment and orbital susceptibility .",
    "the main results include : ( 1 ) an analytic study of electron quantum interference effects resulting from sums over magnetic phase factors associated with 3d closed paths , ( 2 ) a very efficient computation of these  lattice path - integrals \" @xmath31 in closed - form expressions , ( 3 ) explicit analytic expressions , in terms of the lattice path - integrals , for the fermi - sea ground - state energy @xmath4 as a function of the fluxes for electron fillings @xmath7 at and near one half , ( 4 ) the 3d lattice path - integrals to very high order and the total energies in various flux orientations , ( 5 ) the investigation of the zero - field orbital susceptibility @xmath10 as a function of the fermi energy @xmath11 , and ( 6 ) the magnetic moment @xmath246 and susceptibility @xmath247 as functions of the flux , both at half - filling .",
    "we find that the absolute minimum of @xmath198 at half - filling occurs at @xmath204 in all of the flux orientations under consideration , except for the configuration @xmath157 in 3d .",
    "it becomes evident that hopping in an additional direction drastically changes the properties found in strictly two - dimensional systems .",
    "it is also seen that the magnetic response , in the presence of a strong periodic potential , is significantly distinct from the familiar landau diamagnetism  where in a 2d electron gas @xmath237 takes the largest value close to @xmath238 , and decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath239 .",
    "for the zero - field susceptibility @xmath10 , diamagnetism dominates in spite of small fluctuations of @xmath10 around zero for small electron filling @xmath7 . on the average , with increasing @xmath11 , the quantity @xmath269 _ non - monotonically _ decreases from a large positive ( diamagnetic ) value to a relatively small negative ( paramagnetic ) value . for @xmath270 ,",
    "the orbital response becomes paramagnetic .",
    "both the field - dependent @xmath253 and @xmath271 exhibit irregular oscillations according to the direction of the field . for the four flux orientations",
    "@xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 , the magnetic moment @xmath246 is always zero at @xmath252 and @xmath272 ; and paramagnetism ( @xmath273 ) exists at @xmath252 for all these flux orientations . however , when @xmath274 , the magnetic response is paramagnetic for the flux configuration @xmath157 , and diamagnetic for the other three orientations",
    ".    here , we add a remark on the quantity @xmath275 . it is known that at zero temperature the persistent current@xcite in a metal ring threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath276 is proportional to the sum over the contributions of @xmath277 from all occupied states , where @xmath278 is the eigenstate energy .",
    "we therefore can regard @xmath275 as a generalized  current \" in this multiply - connected lattice system .",
    "an approach commonly employed in recent years to study electrons in a magnetic field @xmath279 ( e.g. , refs .",
    "4 - 6 ) uses the bloch theorem and maps the problem into a @xmath280 matrix problem  related to a @xmath280 cell with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in the actual lattice .",
    "thus , for @xmath281 , the electron energy levels are determined by considering a @xmath282 cell with pbc in the lattice and diagonalizing a @xmath282 matrix .",
    "this approach presents a problem for any irrational field , since @xmath283 , and a periodic cell can not be realized .",
    "we do not follow this approach , thus , we can explicitly consider a _",
    "continuum _ of values of @xmath165 , without treating irrational numbers on a special footing .",
    "our lattice path - integrals are local quantities . by construction , they are valid for _ any _ value of the magnetic field . the pbc we impose [ in eq .",
    "( 9 ) ] are only designed to make these lattice path - integrals homogeneous ( i.e. , translationally invariant ) and have nothing to do with the imposition of a bloch theorem . indeed ,",
    "in contrast to most works studying electrons in a magnetic field , here we never invoke any k - space or momentum - space : our sums over closed paths ( lattice path - integrals ) are all explicitly defined in real space .",
    "the lattice path - integrals obtained here are  many - loop \" generalizations of the standard ",
    "one - loop \" aharonov - bohm - type argument , where the electron wave function picks up a phase factor @xmath1 each time it travels around a closed loop enclosing a net flux @xmath2 .",
    "the evaluation of these lattice path - integrals enables us to analytically obtain the total energies , magnetic moments , and orbital susceptibilities of the corresponding flux states .",
    "the spirit of our approach follows feynman s programme : to derive physical quantities in terms of  sums over paths \" .",
    "this method is considerably different from the standard ones that have been employed so far ( e.g. , transforming the problem to momentum space and computing @xmath4 numerically ) . in particular",
    ", it allows the analytic calculation of physical quantities as explicit functions of a continuously - tunable flux , while other approaches need to separately consider different cases ( e.g. , matrices ) for several discrete ( rational ) values of the magnetic field .",
    "the lattice path approach can also be used for a variety of other physical problems , including the derivation and analysis of the superconducting transition temperature in wire networks and josephson - junction arrays ( see , e.g. , refs .  10 and 11 ) , and the analytical computation of the magnetoconductance for strongly localized electrons.@xcite    we thank a. rojo for conversations and for bringing to our attention ref .  7 , and g. vignale for useful comments on the manuscript .",
