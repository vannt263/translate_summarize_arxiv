    "the first sum runs over pairs of neighboring sites @xmath8 of the square or cubic lattice ; @xmath9 is the exchange integral , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , determines the strength of the anisotropy along the easy axis ( @xmath12axis ) .",
    "the field @xmath2 acts along the @xmath12axis .",
    "classical xxz antiferromagnets on square and cubic lattices have been analyzed using monte carlo techniques first about three decades ago @xcite .",
    "additional phases in the ( @xmath13)plane , observed in experiments and theoretical studies , have been attributed to , for instance , further anisotropy terms and/or interactions ranging beyond nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "one of the main aims of the present contribution is to draw attention to recent theoretical analyses of the classical xxz antiferromagnet and its analogue for spins with only two components , the anisotropic xy antiferromagnet @xcite . especially , the importance of non  collinear structures of biconical ( bc ) or bidirectional ( bd ) type , see fig .",

    ", these structures may be enhanced or suppressed , depending on whether that term favors a planar or a uniaxial anisotropy @xcite .",
    "some of the recent theoretical analyses have been partly motivated by experiments on quasi ",
    "twodimensional cuprate antiferromagnets , the telephone number compounds @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "thence , we shall discuss also more complicated models for uniaxially anisotropic twodimensional antiferromagnets proposed to describe such compounds , in particular @xmath15 ( here , one may mention previous and recent experimental studies on related quasi  twodimensional antiferromagnets @xcite as well ) .",

    "the classical xxz heisenberg antiferromagnet is described by the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , where we shall deal with spin vectors of length unity on square and cubic lattices .",
    "we first consider the twodimensional version .",
    "phase diagrams in the @xmath17plane are depicted in fig .",
    "2 , where we set the exchange anisotropy @xmath10 to be equal to 2/3 and 4/5 , the latter case being the standard choice @xcite .",
    "the general topology of the phase diagram seems to be independent of the concrete value of @xmath10 , @xmath18 , comprising the long  range ordered af and the algebraically ordered sf phase .",
    "the boundary lines to the disordered phase are in the ising universality class for the af case , and in the kosterlitz ",
    "thouless universality class @xcite for the sf case @xcite .",
    "the af and sf phase boundary lines approach each other very closely near the maximum of the sf phase boundary in the @xmath17plane , see fig .",
    "3 . accordingly , at low temperatures , there may be either a direct transition between the af and sf phases , or two separate transitions with an extremely narrow intervening phase may occur .    indeed , recent simulations suggest a narrow ( disordered ) phase between the af and sf phases @xcite , extending presumably down to zero temperature @xcite",
    ". the evidence has been provided by determining the universality classes of the transitions at low temperatures @xcite , remaining to be of ising or kosterlitz  thouless type , and by finite  size arguments in the limit of @xmath1 approaching zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the presence of that intervening phase may be argued @xcite to be closely related to the highly degenerate ground state occurring at the field @xmath19 separating the af and sf structures . at that point , not only af and sf configurations have the same energy , but also biconical structures .",
    "those structures may be described by the tilt angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 characterizing the orientations of spin vectors at neighboring sites , belonging to the two different sublattices @xmath22 and @xmath23 , see fig .",
    "the two tilt angles are interrelated by @xcite    @xmath24    with the bc configurations interpolating continuously between the af and sf structures , where the tilt angle @xmath20 ranges from 0 to @xmath25 .",
    "the relevance of bc fluctuations in the transition region between the af and sf phases at low temperatures may be conveniently seen by studying probability functions of the tilt angles , such as the probability @xmath26 for finding the two angles , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , at neighboring sites and the probability @xmath27 for encountering the tilt angle @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "the rather low probability for configurations deviating only slightly from the af structure , see fig .",
    "4 , is caused by the small radii of their cones. in fact , at @xmath30 , the probability of @xmath29 along the line given by eq.(3 ) is proportional to @xmath31 . in any event ,",
    "the , presumably , narrow disordered phase seems to be governed by degenerate bc fluctuations , with a hidden tetracritical point at zero temperature @xcite .     and  @xmath21 on neighboring sites for the xxz antiferromagnet , with  @xmath32 spins , at  @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and  @xmath35 .",

    "only a few years ago , this scenario has been questioned , based on high - order perturbative renormalization group calculations @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that , instead of the bicritical point , there may be a tetracritical biconical @xcite point , due to an intervening ordered biconical phase in between the af and sf phases , or a point at which first  order transition lines meet .",
    "our previous monte carlo simulations @xcite for the threedimensional xxz antiferromagnet agreed with a first ",

    ", we locate a triple point at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , in reasonable agreement with the estimate by landau and binder @xcite .",
    "so far we did not specify its ( multicritical ) character .",
    "moreover , we analyzed @xmath29 , showing that bc fluctuations occur in the transition region between the af and sf phases temperatures well below @xmath41 .",
    "however , in contrast to the twodimensional case , one now observes a tendency towards coexistence of the af and sf phases , as reflected by fairly pronounced maxima at the corresponding points in the @xmath42 plane , compare with fig .",
    "we also estimated critical exponents from monitoring the size dependence of the maxima in the longitudinal , i.e. along the easy axis , as well as the transverse staggered susceptibilities and the specific heat near the transition between the af and sf phases at temperatures somewhat below that triple point . in agreement with previous findings @xcite and the behavior of @xmath29 , a transition of first order between the af and sf phases is strongly suggested @xcite .",

    "accordingly , at low temperatures , there seems to be , again , either a direct transition between the af and sf phases , or two separate transitions with an extremely narrow intervening phase .    in principle , now a bicritical point , with o(2 ) symmetry , may occur at non  zero temperature , being of kosterlitz  thouless type .",
    "our simulations , however , suggest that , like in the xxz case , there is a narrow disordered phase intervening between the af and sf phases down to temperatures well below the point where the af and sf phases approach each other very closely @xcite",
    ". in particular , critical exponents of the staggered susceptibilities are found to be compatible with the ising universality class holding now for the transitions of the af as well as the sf phases to the disordered phase .",
    "the narrow intervening phase seems to be due to degenerate bidirectional structures , see fig .",
    "1 , arising from the highly degenerate ground state at the field @xmath48 , which separates the af and sf structures .",

    ", an ordered bc phase arises at low temperatures , bordered by the af and sf phases , as shown in fig . 7 . based on renormalization group calculations @xcite ,",

    "we observe a transition of first order separating the af and sf phases .",
    "evidence for that kind of transition is provided , especially , by the critical exponent describing the size  dependence of the maximum in the longitudinal staggered susceptibility and by a coexistence phenomenon of af and sf structures in the transition region between the two ordered phases , showing up , e.g. , in @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "when the uniaxiality is solely due to a single  ion anisotropy , @xmath60 , bc structures do not occur as ground state .",
    "accordingly , one may tend to believe that , at low temperatures , a direct transition of first order between the af and sf phases takes place , in contrast to a conflicting claim @xcite .",
    "of course , this aspect needs to be clarified .    here , attention is also drawn to interesting recent work on a twodimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet with long  range dipolar interactions providing a uniaxial anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the quasi ",
    "twodimensional uniaxially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet @xmath15 shows intriguing magnetic features , as the consequence of an interplay of spin and charge properties in the coupled @xmath61 spin chains @xcite , see below .",
    "perhaps most interestingly , at low temperatures a sharp transition at a fairly low field along the easy axis is followed , at a higher field , by an anomaly in the susceptibility .",
    "@xcite . ]    to describe the measured spin  wave dispersion of @xmath15 matsuda _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a classical twodimensional model with short  range exchange interactions and a single  ion anisotropy @xcite .",
    "however , the model does not reproduce thermal properties of that magnet like the sharp transition @xcite .",
    "that transition has been argued to indicate the thermal breaking of defect stripes @xcite .",
    "the defects correspond to nonmagnetic @xmath62ions , due to mobile holes , replacing some of the magnetic @xmath63ions in the @xmath61 spin chains ( the defect concentration is about 10 percent ) .",
    "indeed , such a transition has been described by an ising model with mobile defects @xcite .",
    "introducing nonmagnetic , mobile defects in the model of matsuda _ et al .",
    "_ is , however , not sufficient to reconcile the discrepancy with the measurements @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed anomaly at higher fields has been explained qualitatively as indicating the onset of merely @xmath64 spin  flop structures related to a significant decrease in the mobility of the defects or holes @xcite .",
    "this presumption has been used in a twodimensional uniaxially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet , with an exchange anisotropy and short  range competing interactions by including defects _ quenched _ at randomly chosen lattice sites @xcite .",
    "the model parameters have been carefully chosen , partly on theoretical , partly on experimental grounds .",
    "in fact , the model then reproduces ( semi)quantitatively the field dependence of the anomaly when changing the temperature , see fig .",
    "9 . from the simulations ,",
    "one easily sees that the anomaly is driven by the onset of merely local spin  flop structures , its local character being due to the quenched random defects .",
    "note that the competing exchange interactions may induce helical spin configurations when tuning the parameters suitably @xcite .",
    "we should like to mention a recent study on these telephone number compounds applying density functional theory @xcite , which might also be useful to quantify model parameters .",

    "schmid _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed quantum monte carlo simulations to determine the phase diagram , for @xmath71 .",
    "they found a topology which resembles that of the classical xxz antiferromagnet with a negative single ",
    "ion anisotropy , compare with fig . 9 . on the boundary line of the af phase a tricritical point has been reported to occur at @xmath72 , below which the transition to the paramagnetic phase is of first order .",
    "the triple point , at which the af , sf , and disordered phases meet , is proposed to be a critical endpoint , located at @xmath73 .    to check these predictions",
    ", we performed large scale quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite using the method of stochastic series expansions with directed loop updates @xcite . from those simulations , considering larger system sizes and improved statistics ,",
    "we conclude that the previous analysis has to be viewed with care .",
    "for instance , we studied the model , @xmath65 , at @xmath74= 0.13 , i.e. in between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , near the af phase boundary .",
    "in particular , we monitored the size dependence of peak positions in the magnetization histograms , see fig . 11 .",
    "obviously , the two peaks , corresponding to af and sf structures , may well coincide at the transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thence the transition may well be continuous , in contrast to the previous suggestion .",
    "actually , at the lowest temperature we studied , @xmath77 , a continuous transition might still occur @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the previous @xcite scenario with the triple point being a critical endpoint needs to be shifted to somewhat lower temperatures , if it exits at all .    in any event , a clue on possibly distinct phase diagrams for the classical and quantum xxz antiferromagnets on a square lattice may be the possibly different role of biconical fluctuations .",
    "that aspect deserves further studies .",
    "in this contribution we presented results of recent monte carlo simulations on classical xxz antiferromagnets in a field along the easy axis as well as classical variants and on the s=1/2 xxz antiferromagnet on a square lattice .      the role of non  collinear structures of biconical and bidirectional type in classical models is emphasized .",
    "these structures have an important effect on phase diagrams , in particular , the transition region between the af and sf phases at low temperatures , and they may provide a clue to explain the possibly different topology of the phase diagrams of classical and quantum , s=1/2 , xxz antiferromagnets in two dimensions .",
