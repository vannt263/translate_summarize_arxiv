    "half - metallic ferromagnetism was first predicted for the half heusler compound nimnsb by de groot _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "a half - metallic ferromagnet is a material with a gap between spin states at the fermi energy ( @xmath4 ) , such that the majority states are conducting and the minority states are semi - conducting .",
    "half - metallic ferromagnets ( hmf ) are supposed to exhibit a real gap in the minority ( or majority ) density of states ( dos ) .",
    "this gap has in compounds with integer site occupancies the consequence that the magnetic moment has to be an integer , because the number of occupied minority states is integer .",
    "it should be noted that the hmf character is lost if an already small deviation from an integer value is observed .",
    "certain x@xmath0yz heusler compounds have also been predicted to show half - metallic ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "co and mn containing heusler compounds have attracted particular attention , as they are strongly ferromagnetic with high curie temperatures ( above 900k ) @xcite .",
    "one of them - co@xmath0mnsi - is an attractive candidate for many applications in spin dependent electronics .",
    "this compound was used by several groups to produce thin films @xcite and devices @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that co@xmath0fesi is also a very good candidate as it exhibits a very high curie temperature of 1100k and a magnetic moment of 6@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this compound is somewhat peculiar regarding its curie temperature and magnetic moment because both are reaching the highest values observed up to now in this class of materials .    in heusler as well as other compounds ,",
    "the half - metallic ferromagnetism has not yet been unambiguously confirmed by experiments , although there is strong evidence in some cases . despite a lot of work on co and mn containing heusler compounds @xcite , a breakthrough",
    "is still required to prove the existence of half metallic ferromagnetism in these materials .",
    "the electronic structure plays an important role in determining the magnetic properties of the heusler compounds . in this work ,",
    "a comprehensive investigation of the equilibrium structural , electronic and magnetic properties of co@xmath0fesi is presented and compared to co@xmath0mnsi .",
    "the dependence of the magnetic moment on the lattice parameter was analyzed , focusing on the differences between lsda ( local spin density approximation ) and gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) treatments .",
    "a series of calculations for co@xmath0 based heusler compounds was performed which shows that mostly all co@xmath0 based heusler compounds exhibit half - metallic ferromagnetism @xcite , in agreement with ref.@xcite .",
    "the slater - pauling rule @xcite fits for most co@xmath0 based heusler compounds and may be used as a rule of thumb for estimating their magnetic moments .",
    "according to this rule the magnetic moment of co@xmath0fesi is expected to be @xmath1 per unit cell .",
    "this work was stimulated by a recent experimental study that was devoted to the magnetic moment and curie temperature of the co@xmath0fesi compound @xcite . to provide a concise picture of the co@xmath0ysi systems ( y = mn , fe )",
    ", a theoretical investigation will be presented utilizing the local ( spin ) density approximation ( l(s)da ) , gga , and lda+@xmath6 methods .",
    "heusler compounds @xcite belong to a group of ternary intermetallics with the stoichiometric composition x@xmath0yz ordered in an @xmath7-type structure , space group @xmath8 , many of which are ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the prototype cu@xmath0mnal is a ferromagnet even though none of its constituents is one @xcite . in general , the x and y atoms are transition metals and z is a main group element . in some cases y",
    "is replaced by a rare earth element .",
    "the x atoms are placed on 8a ( 1/4,1/4,1/4 ) wyckoff positions and the y and z atoms on 4a ( 0,0,0 ) and 4b ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) .",
    "the cubic @xmath7 structure consists overall of four interpenetrating fcc lattices , two of them equally occupied by x. the latter two x@xmath0 fcc sub - lattices combine to a simple cubic sub - lattice .",
    "thus , the , compound may be seen as a cscl ( b2 ) superstructure with the cubic vacancies of the x@xmath0 sub - lattice filled alternatingly by y or z atoms .",
    "other than in a simple cscl structure , the nearest neighbor polyhedra of each @xmath9 atom are given by two different tetrahedra ( rotated by @xmath10 with respect to each other ) that are built from either y or z atoms .",
    "the @xmath11 point of the paramagnetic structure has the symmetry @xmath12 .",
    "however , the wave functions at the @xmath11 point have to be described by @xmath13 in the ferromagnetic state to account for the correct transformation of the electron spin .",
    "self consistent band structure calculations were carried out using the full potential linear augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method as provided by p. blaha _",
    "et al _ ( wien2k ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed using the von  barth - hedin @xcite parametrization of the exchange - correlation functional within lda .",
    "further , the perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite implementation of gga was used .",
    "gga accounts specifically for density gradients that are neglected in pure l(s)da .",
    "the energy threshold between core and valence states was set to -6ry .",
    "we considered 2.3a@xmath14 for the muffin - tin radii ( @xmath15 ) of all atoms leading to nearly touching spheres .",
    "455 irreducible @xmath16 points of a @xmath17 mesh , were used for brillouin zone integration .",
    "the number of plane waves was restricted by @xmath18 .",
    "the energy convergence criterion was set to @xmath19 .",
    "simultaneously , the charge convergence was monitored and the calculation was restarted if it was still above @xmath20 .    finally , the lda@xmath2 method @xcite was used to account for on - site correlation at the transition metal sites .",
    "the lda@xmath2 method accounts for an orbital dependence of the coulomb and exchange interaction that is absent in pure lda . here",
    ", the effective coulomb - exchange interaction ( @xmath3 ) was used for the calculations .",
    "this particular scheme is used in wien2k to include double - counting correction .",
    "one leaves the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) by applying the lda@xmath2 method .",
    "however , it is one of the most popular and easiest approaches to consider electron - electron correlation .",
    "it will be shown that the lda@xmath2 method gives qualitative and quantitative improvements compared to the bare lda or gga approaches , when applied to co@xmath0fesi .",
    "the main focus was put on the magnetic moment as this shows a very strong discrepancy if comparing the experimental and calculated values reported for co@xmath0fesi .",
    "et al _ @xcite reported already a magne , tic moment of 5.9@xmath5 per unit cell at 10k , whereas band structure calculations using the screened korringa - kohn - rostocker method ( kkr ) predicted later only @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the present lsda calculations ( flapw ) revealed also a total magnetic moment of only 5.29@xmath5 .",
    "this value is much lower than the measured value of about 6@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such a large discrepancy points clearly that the actual electronic structure of this compound is different from the calculated one .",
    "even so the calculations for co@xmath0mnsi agree with the experiment concerning the magnetic moment , their reliability concerning the details of the electronic structure may have to be called in question as long as the differences obtained for co@xmath0fesi stay unexplained .",
    "the discrepancy between experiment and calculation was not removed when using the gga parametrization resulting still in a too low value ( @xmath22 ) . inspecting the spin",
    "resolved density of states ( dos ) and band structure revealed the appearance of a gap in the minority bands , but located below the fermi energy ( see figs.[fig_8]b,[fig_9]e in sec.[secios : eslu ] ) .",
    "this is finally one reason why the magnetic moment is too low and not an integer . in the following",
    ", details of the electronic structure calculations will be discussed .",
    "first , a structural optimization was performed for co@xmath0fesi and co@xmath0mnsi to determine whether the experimental lattice parameter minimizes the total energy .",
    "it was found that the optimized lattice parameter from the calculation agrees very well with experimental values of @xmath23and @xmath24 . within the flapw scheme the structure optimization for co@xmath0ysi ( y =",
    "mn , fe ) was performed using the gga parametrization and a spin polarized ( ferromagnetic ) setup .",
    "the initial crystal structural parameter for @xmath25 is taken from the experimental value @xmath26 and varied in steps of 2% .",
    "for each of the different @xmath27 parameter , the iteration procedure was performed up to self - consistency .",
    "the energy minimum then defines the optimal value of @xmath27 .    for co@xmath0fesi",
    ", the energy minimum ( ferromagnetic ) was found to appear at @xmath28(corresponding to @xmath29% , see fig.[fig_1 ]  gga ) .",
    "it was also found that the ferromagnetic ( spin polarized ) configuration has the lower minimum total energy compared to the paramagnetic ( non spin polarized ) case , not shown here .",
    "similar calculations revealed for co@xmath0mnsi that the energy minimum appears at @xmath30(corresponding to @xmath31%",
    ".    fesi .",
    "shown is the change of the total energy as function of the lattice parameter ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the gga results are compared to lda@xmath2 calculations with different @xmath33 ( see text ) .",
    "note that all energy scales are shifted to result in @xmath34 for better comparison .",
    "the lines are results from a polynomial fit.,width=226 ]    figure [ fig_1 ] displays in addition the results of a structural optimization using the lda@xmath2 scheme with @xmath33 as variational parameter .",
    "the results of this optimization being performed for different values of @xmath33 will be discussed below in sec.[secios : ece ] .      in order to understand why lsda and gga do not give the expected magnetic moment and position of the gap ,",
    "the dependence of both on the lattice parameter was carefully inspected for co@xmath0fesi as well as co@xmath0mnsi .",
    "it is important to compare the electronic structure of co@xmath0fesi with co@xmath0mnsi as the latter is predicted to be a half - metallic ferromagnet with the measured magnetic moment of 5@xmath5 found in calculations using the experimental lattice parameter .",
    "however , a spin polarization of only about 55% was obtained for this compound as determined by point contact andreev reflection spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the spin polarization at the fermi energy determined by means of photo emission was even lower ( @xmath35% ) @xcite .",
    "the calculated total and site specific magnetic moments are shown in fig.[fig_2 ] for co@xmath0fesi and co@xmath0mnsi . in co@xmath0fesi ( fig.[fig_2]b ) ,",
    "the calculated atomic resolved magnetic moments of co and fe increase both with @xmath27 and the overall magnetic moment follows the same trend , it increases from @xmath36 to above @xmath1 with increase of @xmath27 .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath1 is found for an enlargement of the lattice parameter by about @xmath37% .",
    "the site specific moments seem to saturate above + 6% change of the lattice parameter at about 1.5@xmath5 and 3@xmath5 for co and fe , respectively .",
    "( slightly higher values are compensated by an anti - parallel alignment of the moments at si sites and in the interstitial . )",
    "mnsi ( a ) and co@xmath0fesi ( b ) as function of the lattice parameter .",
    "experimental values are assigned by a cross .",
    "the experimental lattice parameters are @xmath38and @xmath39 .",
    "lines are drawn through the calculated values to guide the eye.,width=302 ]    the total magnetic moment of co@xmath0mnsi ( fig.[fig_2]a ) increases also slightly with the lattice parameter but it stays at @xmath40 in the range of @xmath41% change of @xmath27 .",
    "there is a significant change in the magnetic moment at mn sites , it increases with lattice parameter . at the same time , the magnetic moment of co decreases .",
    "thus the co moment counter balances the mn moment such that the overall magnetic moment keeps constant while changing the lattice parameter .    at this point",
    "one can say that a moderate change of the lattice parameter does not change the overall magnetic moment of co@xmath0mnsi .",
    "the case of co@xmath0fesi is completely different and an overall change of about 1@xmath5 is observed in the same range of @xmath42 as for co@xmath0mnsi .",
    "overall , the magnetic moment of co@xmath0fesi is less stable against variation of the lattice parameter ( at least if using the same parameters for integration and convergence criteria as for the co@xmath0mnsi calculations ) .",
    "it exhibits some fluctuations about the integer value at very large lattice parameter .",
    "the formation of the gap and localized magnetic moments in heusler compounds is due to hybridization as was explained in detail by kbler _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "there is a close relation between the magnetic moment and the hmf character .",
    "the appearance of the gap in the minority density constrains the number of minority electrons to be integer .",
    "however , an integer value of the magnetic moment may not result automatically in a real gap in the minority ( or majority ) density .",
    "the band structure of co@xmath0fesi ( see also below in sec.[secios : eslu ] ) revealed already a small gap in the minority states in the calculation for the experimental lattice parameter , but this gap is located below the fermi energy ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , the band structure was closer inspected in order to proof whether the integer moment is related with the appearance of a real hmf minority gap .",
    "figure [ fig_3 ] shows the dependence of the extremal energies of the lower ( valence ) band and the upper ( conduction ) band of the minority states enveloping the gap . for both materials",
    "the magnetic moment has to be integer in the region were @xmath4 falls into the gap ( gray shaded areas in fig.[fig_3 ] ) , that is the region of half - metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "mnsi ( a ) and co@xmath0fesi ( b ) .",
    "the shaded areas assign the region of half - metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "lines are drawn to guide the eye.,width=302 ]    figure [ fig_3]a shows the dependence of the gap on the lattice parameter for co@xmath0mnsi .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the region of half - metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "it is clearly seen that co@xmath0mnsi behaves like a hmf within @xmath43% change of the lattice parameter .",
    "therefore , a moderate change of the lattice parameter does not change the hmf behavior of co@xmath0mnsi .",
    "figure [ fig_3]b shows the dependence of the gap on the lattice parameter for co@xmath0fesi .",
    "it is seen that the gap encloses the fermi energy between 7.5% and 12% enlargement of the lattice parameter .",
    "the gap is completely closed for lattice parameter being 4% smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "obviously the gap ( @xmath44ev at + 12% ) is smaller compared to co@xmath0mnsi ( @xmath45ev at -2.5% ) and appears in a narrower range of the lattice parameter .",
    "so far it is seen that the hmf character and thus the integer magnetic moment is more stable against variation of the lattice parameter in co@xmath0mnsi compared to co@xmath0fesi .",
    "an enlargement of the lattice parameter by @xmath46% , as needed to explain the magnetic moment of co@xmath0fesi , corresponds to a volume - expansion of about @xmath47% .",
    "such a large expansion of the crystal volume by about 1/3 is rather unrealistic and falls far out of the expected uncertainties for the experimental determination of @xmath27 .",
    "however , it may be interesting to inspect which changes in the electronic structure are caused by such an expansion .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) and the band structure of co@xmath0fesi are shown in fig.[fig_4 ] for the enlarged lattice parameter .",
    "the calculations were performed using the gga scheme .",
    "an expansion of @xmath48% was used in the calculation ( for @xmath490 see sec.[secios : eslu ] and also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this particular value was chosen as it is the case where the fermi energy lies just in the middle of the gap of the minority dos ( see fig.[fig_4]a , b ) and thus the material would securely be in a hmf state .",
    "fesi with enlarged lattice parameter .",
    "( lsda - gga , @xmath50),width=321 ]    there are no minority states at @xmath4 confirming the compound to be in a hmf state .",
    "the high density below @xmath4 is dominated by @xmath51 states being located at co and fe sites .",
    "the small density of states near @xmath4 in the majority dos emerges from the strongly dispersing majority bands crossing the fermi energy . from the spin",
    "resolved bands , it is seen that the majority bands cross or touch the fermi energy ( @xmath4 ) in rather all directions of high symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the minority bands exhibit a clear gap around @xmath4 . for co@xmath0fesi , the width of the gap is given by the energies of the highest occupied band at the @xmath11-point and the lowest unoccupied band at the @xmath11 or @xmath9-point .",
    "the smaller value is found between @xmath11 and @xmath9 , thus it is an indirect gap .",
    "the conclusion drawn from the displayed electronic structure is that the states around the fermi energy are strongly spin polarized and the system is according to the calculations indeed a half - metallic ferromagnet , at least for an enlarged lattice parameter .",
    "the gap in the minority dos has the compelling result that the magnetic moment is integer with a value of @xmath1 , as expected from the experiment .",
    "the change of the electronic structure with the lattice parameter is clear from two basic points of view .",
    "firstly , from a free electron like band structure one expects a change of the band gradients and thus simply a shift of @xmath4 due to the accompanied changes in the dos .",
    "secondly , from a tight binding like approach one expects a difference in both , overlap and hopping integrals .",
    "in particular , they will be smaller for larger lattice parameter . with a decrease of @xmath27 ,",
    "the interaction between the atoms becomes stronger and the higher overlap results in a stronger de - localization of the electrons .",
    "obviously the overlap is too large in the calculation using the experimental lattice parameter of co@xmath0fesi . on the other hand",
    "one may make use for nearly hmf compounds that small deviations of the magnetic moment from integer values can be compensated by small variations of the lattice parameter supposed the lsda ( gga ) calculations result in the correct electronic structure .",
    "unfortunately , the opposite is also true .",
    "if the calculated fermi energy is not just in the middle of the minority gap , then a small deviation of the lattice parameter may destroy the hmf character .",
    "the major conclusion that can be drawn from the needed increase of the lattice parameter of co@xmath0fesi is that bare lsda ( gga ) calculations are not sufficient to explain its electronic and geometric structure at the same time and thus may fail for similar compounds , too .",
    "moreover , it is suggested that electron - electron correlation might play an important role for opening the gap in the minority states and to get the magnetic moment with an integer value .",
    "the verification of the experimental results has to be fulfilled independent of the material for both , lattice parameter and magnetic moment . in the following section",
    "it will be analyzed whether this goal can be reached possibly by inclusion of correlation .",
    "the relative importance of itinerant versus localized properties of @xmath51 electrons in metal alloys was already discussed by van vleck @xcite and slater @xcite .",
    "heusler compounds are generally thought as systems exhibiting localized magnetic moments as was first mentioned by pauling for cu@xmath0mnal @xcite . in particular , the magnetic moments of the co@xmath0yz half - metallic ferromagnets follow strictly the",
    "_ localized _",
    "part of the well known slater - pauling curve @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath51 electrons are de - localized in metals .",
    "thus , the question about correlation in transition metal based compounds is to what extent the on - site coulomb interaction between @xmath51 electrons is preserved such that important atomic properties like hund s rule correlation are significant and determine the magnetic properties at least partially @xcite .",
    "the idea from the above discussion is , after the structural optimization failed to explain the magnetic moment of co@xmath0fesi , that inclusion of electron - electron correlation may be necessary in order to respect a partial _ localization _ of the @xmath51 electrons in a better way .",
    "therefore , the lda@xmath2 method was used to recalculate the electronic structure of co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0fesi .",
    "the lda@xmath2 scheme is designed to model localized states when on - site coulomb interaction becomes important .",
    "it gives a self energy correction to localized states embedded in de - localized states .",
    "the energy @xmath6 of the coulomb interaction is rather large in free atoms ( 17ev to 27ev in @xmath52 transition metals , see fig.[fig_5 ] ) , while screening results in solids in a much smaller values @xcite ( for example 4.5ev in bcc fe ) . in the present work ,",
    "the value of the effective coulomb - exchange interaction @xmath3 was varied in order to reproduce the measured magnetic moment .",
    "it turned out that @xmath33 from 2.5ev to 5.0ev for co and simultaneously 2.4ev to 4.8ev for fe result in a magnetic moment of @xmath1 .",
    "these values for @xmath33 correspond to about @xmath53% of the free atom values as calculated from the corresponding slater integrals by means of cowan s program @xcite .",

    "the occupied states of the minority dos exhibit a less complicated behavior , they are mainly shifted towards the fermi energy .    for co@xmath0fesi as shown in fig.[fig_8]b , @xmath71 was chosen because for this value the fermi energy lies just in the middle of the gap .",

    "the situation is clear at this stage : the gap in the minority states stays only within a certain range of the effective coulomb - exchange interaction .",
    "if one goes away from that limit the fermi energy falls not longer inside of the gap and the material loses its hmf character .",
    "it is also obvious that the mechanism leading to the half - metallic ferromagnetism in co@xmath0fesi serves to destroy it in co@xmath0mnsi .",

    "it was found that the gap in the minority dos stays up to @xmath103ev for mn and 2.5ev for co. for larger values of @xmath33 , that means for stronger correlation , the system loses its hmf character , by shifting @xmath4 outside the minority gap .",

    "many effects have been considered to explain the missing experimental proof of the complete spin polarization in predicted half - metallic ferromagnets @xcite . for sure ,",
    "each of these effects may serve by itself to reduce the spin polarization at the fermi energy . on the other hand ,",
    "none of these effects is able to explain a difference of 15% between the observed and calculated magnetic moments like for the case of co@xmath0fesi .",
    "the appearance of surface or interface states @xcite may decrease the spin - polarization in certain layers but will not influence drastically the measurements of the magnetization of bulk samples .",
    "magnon excitations @xcite will lead to a decrease of the magnetic moment with temperature rather than in an increase and thus can easily been disregarded here .",
    "spin - orbit interaction couples , indeed , spin - up and spin - down states @xcite but does not enhance the magnetic moment , as was shown above . from this point of view",
