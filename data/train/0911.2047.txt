    "<S> the word ` universal ' above is used in the sense of @xcite where they essentially prove that @xmath10 is universal for all subfactor planar algebras .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall now outline the structure of this paper . in  </S>",
    "<S> 1 we construct - see proposition [ p1 ] - a graded , tracial , faithful @xmath11-probability space @xmath12 associated to a finite , weighted , bipartite graph @xmath13 and establish - see proposition [ same ] - an isomorphism between @xmath12 and a filtered , tracial , faithful @xmath11-probability space @xmath14 - see proposition [ p3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> our main interest will be in an associated finite von neumann algebra @xmath15 and some of its corners determined by sets of vertices of @xmath13 - specifically the corner @xmath16 ( respectively @xmath17 ) determined by the set of even ( respectively odd ) vertices of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the main result in  2 asserts - see theorem [ mgamstr ] - that if @xmath13 is a connected graph with more than one edge , then , @xmath15 is the direct sum of a @xmath0 factor and a finite - dimensional abelian algebra . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of  3 is to express @xmath18 and @xmath16 - see proposition [ freeness ] and equation ( [ mgamam ] ) - as amalgamated free products of the corresponding algebras associated to subgraphs with a single odd vertex . in  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we determine the structure of @xmath19 - see corollary [ l0str ] - for a graph @xmath20 with a single odd vertex . the penultimate  5 proves - see theorem [ mgamlf ] - one of our main results : for a connected graph @xmath13 with more than one edge and equipped with its perron - frobenius weighting </S>",
    "<S> , the algebra @xmath15 is an interpolated free group factor with finite parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the final  6 applies this - see theorems [ main ] and [ main2 ] - to show that the guionnet - jones - shlyakhtenko ( henceforth gjs ) construction applied to a finite depth subfactor planar algebra yields an inclusion of interpolated free group factors with finite parameters . </S>"
