    "topological insulators are new quantum states discovered recently , which have a bulk band gap and gapless edge states or metallic surface states due to the time - reversal - symmetry and spin - orbit coupling interaction  @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological insulator has first been predicted theoretically as a quantum spin hall state@xcite and then observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "the topological characterization of quantum spin hall insulators can be generalized from 2d to three - dimensional ( 3d ) case , and leads to the discovery of 3d topological insulator ( ti)@xcite .",
    "the tis in 3d are usually classified according to the number of dirac cones on their surfaces .",
    "those strong topological insulators with odd number of dirac cones on their surfaces are robust against the time - reversal invariant disorder , while the weak topological insulator is referred to those with even number dirac cones on their surfaces which depends on the surface direction and might be broken even without breaking the time reversal symmetry@xcite .",
    "when the tis are coated with magnetic or superconducting layers , the surface states could be gapped and many interesting properties emerge , such as half - integer quantum hall effect@xcite , majorana fermion@xcite , etc .",
    "the topological surface states had been observed by several experimental groups by means of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite . although the residual bulk carrier density brings much difficulty to the surface states transport experiments@xcite , the signatures of negligible bulk carriers contributing to the transport@xcite and near @xmath0 surface transport in topological insulator@xcite have been found recently in experiments .",
    "the low energy physics of the surface states of strong topological insulators can be described by the 2d massless dirac theory@xcite , which is different from that in graphene where the spinors are composed of different sublattices@xcite .",

    "the electronic transport properties on topological insulator surface with magnetization has attracted a lot of attention@xcite . in refs .   and",
    "the results are given in the limit of thin barrier ( i.e. , the width of barrier @xmath1@xmath20 and barrier potential @xmath3@xmath4 while @xmath5 is constant ) , and the physical origin of this thin barrier is the mismatch effect and built - in electric field of junction interface . refs .   and studied the spin valve on the surface of topological insulator , in which the exchange fields in the two ferromagnetic leads are assumed to align along the y axis direction .",

    "it is noted that both the electric potential barrier and the ferromagnetic barrier are the transport channels in these models .",
    "the bulk band gap of topological insulator is usually about @xmath6-@xmath7 mev@xcite , in order to keep the transport at the fermi energy inside the bulk gap , and the gate voltage on topological insulator should be finite .    in this paper , we study the electronic transport through a 2d ferromagnet / normal / ferromagnet junction on the surface of a strong topological insulator where a gate voltage is exerted on the normal segment with a finite width , and the exchange fields in the two ferromagnetic leads point mainly to the z axis direction .",
    "so far such a system has not been well studied .",
    "we find that the conductance oscillates with the width of normal segment and gate voltage , and the maximum of conductance gradually decreases while the minimum of conductance can approach zero as the width increases .",
    "these behaviors are more obvious when the gate voltage is smaller than the fermi energy .",
    "this gate - controlled 2d topological ferromagnet / normal / ferromagnet junction shows the property of a spin field - effect transistor .",
    "the magnetoresistance ( mr ) can be very large and could also be negative owing to the anomalous transport .",
    "in addition , when there exists a magnetization component in the 2d plane , it is shown that only the magnetization component which is parallel to the junction interface has an influence on the conductance .",

    "<S> we investigate the electronic transport properties of a ferromagnet / normal / ferromagnet junction on the surface of a topological insulator with a gate voltage exerted on the normal segment . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the conductance oscillates with the width of normal segment and gate voltage , and the maximum of conductance gradually decreases while the minimum of conductance approaches zero as the width increases . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance can be controlled by tuning the gate voltage like a spin field - effect transistor . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the magnetoresistance ratio can be very large , and can also be negative owing to the anomalous transport . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , when there exists a magnetization component in the surface plane , it is shown that only the component parallel to the junction interface has an influence on the conductance . </S>"
