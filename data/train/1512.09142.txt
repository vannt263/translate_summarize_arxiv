    "finally , in  [ sec : community ] we focus on the channels through which the greater community can participate in this community - driven microlensing experiment .",
    "in this section we provide a brief overview of the theoretical background and observational implementation of gravitational microlensing .",
    "see @xcite for a deeper exploration of the fundamental mechanics of lensing , particularly in the context of searches for exoplanets .",
    "readers who possess a foundational understanding of the technical details of microlensing should proceed to  [ sec : science ] .",
    "a microlensing event occurs when the light from a background `` source '' star is magnified by the gravitational potential of an intervening foreground `` lens '' system in a way that is detectable by a given observer .",
    "when describing the temporal evolution of an event , as is shown in figure [ fig : ulens_geometry ] , the coordinate system keeps the lensing body fixed at the origin such that all of the lens - source relative proper motion is encapsulated in the trajectory of the source .",
    "the light from the source is split into two images that , in the case of perfect observer - lens - source colinearity , trace out the einstein radius @xmath5 , the angular scale for microlensing phenomena .    for a lensing system with total mass @xmath6",
    "the einstein ring is defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the relative lens - source parallax , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively . normalizing the relative lens - source parallax to @xmath5 yields the microlens parallax @xmath2 . for typical microlensing surveys toward the galactic bulge ,",
    "@xmath5 is of - order a milliarcsecond or smaller , meaning that the images of the source are not spatially resolved .",
    "an event due to a single lensing mass leads to a light curve defined by three microlensing observables @xcite .",
    "the first is @xmath12 , the time of closest approach of the source to the lens .",
    "second is the impact parameter @xmath13 , which measures the angular distance of the closest approach of the source to the lens and is normalized to @xmath5 .",
    "lastly , the einstein crossing time @xmath14 is defined via : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the relative lens - source proper motion .",
    "since the two images created during the event are not resolved , a given observer measures the total flux of the event . for a single - lens microlensing event the observed flux @xmath17 at a time @xmath18 is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the flux of the source , @xmath21 is the blend flux of all other stars that are not resolved , and @xmath22 is the magnification of the point - like background source star : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the angular separation of the lens and source at a given time @xmath18 , normalized to @xmath5 .    in some cases ,",
    "higher - order effects are imprinted on the light curve . among these",
    "is @xmath25 , the angular radius of the source star , @xmath26 , normalized to @xmath5 : @xmath27 finite - source effects , caused by a value of @xmath25 that is comparable to @xmath13 , and also the higher - order microlens parallax @xmath2 , alter the magnification structure of the light curve , causing it to deviate from a simple paczynski curve .",
    "if the lensing system contains an additional mass whose position is roughly coincident with that of one of the images at any point during the event , the additional gravitational potential introduced by the second body will distort the magnification structure of the event @xcite . in the case of a static two - body lensing system , such as a planet orbiting a host star ,",
    "these perturbations allow for the measurement of three additional parameters .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath28 of a lens comprised of a planet of mass @xmath29 and a star of mass @xmath30 is given by : @xmath31 the instantaneous projected angular separation of the two bodies , normalized to @xmath5 , is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "finally , @xmath33 gives the angle of the source trajectory relative to the star - planet binary axis .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a more complete discussion of microlensing notation conventions .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath28 and the separation @xmath32 of the two lensing masses define the topology governing the location and morphology of the caustics @xcite , which are closed curves in the plane of the lens that identify where the magnification of a point - like source formally diverges to infinity .",
    "these caustic curves increase the probability that @xmath25 will be measured , since the finite size of the source will be  resolved \" from the detailed magnification structure of the light curve if the trajectory of the source passes near to or over one or more caustics . for a lens system comprised of two point masses ,",
    "there are either one , two , or three non - intersecting caustics .",
    "if the second lensing body is low - mass ( @xmath34 ) , there is typically a central caustic located near the primary star and either one ( for @xmath35 ) or two ( for @xmath36 ) planetary caustics , whose position and morphology can be approximated analytically for @xmath34 and @xmath37 @xcite . for @xmath38 , there is one caustic .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for the exact values of @xmath32 where these caustic topologies change for arbitrary @xmath28 .",
    "the light curve , caustic geometry , and source trajectory for an example planetary event are shown in figure [ fig : mb11293_lightcurve ] .",
    "due to the relatively small detectors that were available at the time when microlensing planet surveys were first initiated , they followed a two - tiered strategy that was first advocated by @xcite .",
    "the microlensing event rate , even toward the galactic bulge , where the surface density of stars is the highest , is such that an arbitrary source star in the bulge comes within @xmath0@xmath5 of a foreground lensing star only once every @xmath0100,000 years . to detect a few hundred events per year , it is thus necessary to monitor tens of millions of stars .",
    "survey telescopes with bigger apertures and the largest available fields of view ( fovs ) , such as the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ; @xcite ) and the microlensing observations in astrophysics collaboration ( moa ; @xcite ) , would monitor many tens of square degrees of high stellar density , low extinction fields toward the bulge with cadences of once or twice per night .",
    "these cadences were sufficient to detect and alert the primary events themselves but insufficient to accurately characterize planetary perturbations .",
    "networks of smaller telescopes , such as the microlensing follow - up network ( @xmath39fun ; @xcite ) and the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet ; @xcite ) , with more readily available narrow - angle detectors , would then monitor a subset of the most promising of these alerted events with the cadence and wider longitudinal coverage required to characterize the planetary anomalies .",
    "large format detectors , with fovs of a few square degrees , have facilitated a transition to a phase in which microlensing has been able to increase the planetary yield , by imaging tens of millions of stars in a single pointing with the cadence necessary to detect the primary microlensing events as well as the planet - induced deviations .",
    "furthermore , surveys performed with these detectors are blind and so circumvent the biases introduced by the reliance on subjectivity and human judgment for the selection of follow - up targets .",
    "additional groups such as the wise observatory @xcite , robonet @xcite , and mindstep @xcite have provided greater access to events through improved longitudinal coverage and higher - cadence observations . the korean microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet ) , an array of three 1.6 m telescopes located at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile , south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) in south africa , and siding spring observatory ( sso ) in australia @xcite , represents the next realization of the automated survey strategy , with its ability to conduct a @xmath016 square - degree survey with a @xmath010-minute cadence using a homogeneous network of telescopes @xcite .",
    "however , for a static two - body lens system , additional information beyond the microlensing observables described in  [ sec : ulens_geometry ] is needed to determine the fundamental properties of the planetary system ( @xmath30 , @xmath29 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "there are currently two primary methods to achieve this with minimal model dependence , both of which require measuring @xmath5 , typically by rearranging equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) and combining multiband photometry to determine @xmath26 with a measurement of @xmath25 through a detection of finite - source effects @xcite .",
    "the first avenue is by determining @xmath2 , which can be accomplished through one or both of two primary channels .",
    "one method involves measuring the distortion in the observed light curve due to the acceleration of the observer relative to the light expected for a constant velocity . in this situation",
    ", the single - platform observer could be the earth @xcite , a satellite in low - earth orbit @xcite , or a satellite in geosynchronous orbit @xcite .",
    "this orbital parallax can be measured for events with timescales that are typically a significant fraction of a year and requires good observational coverage ( see @xcite for examples ) .",
    "a second technique involves taking observations from two or more well - separated locations @xcite .",
    "generally this requires two observatories separated by of - order an au in order to produce detectably different light curves .",
    "this is becoming the dominant mechanism for measuring @xmath2 and is referred to as the ",
    "satellite parallax \" technique .",
    "it is possible , however , to measure  terrestrial parallax , \" which involves two observatories at different longitudes on the earth monitoring an intrinsically rare high - magnification event , for which @xmath40 , with extremely high cadence ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in all cases , by combining @xmath2 with @xmath5 the total mass of the lensing system can be determined via equation ( [ eq : thetae ] ) , yielding the masses of the individual components of the lensing system .",
    "furthermore , by assuming the source is located in the galactic bulge , @xmath10 can also be extracted .    recently , _",
    "spitzer _ has been employed to measure satellite parallaxes .",
    "@xcite first used it to measure the microlensing parallax @xmath2 for a weak ( i.e. , non - caustic - crossing ) binary event toward the small magellanic cloud .",
    "a pilot 100-hour program in 2014 made the first satellite parallax measurement of an isolated star @xcite .",
    "the light curve , shown in figure [ fig : ob140939_parallax ] , clearly demonstrates the shifts in @xmath12 and @xmath13 that arise from the @xmath01 au separation between the earth and _ spitzer _ and that alter the magnification of the source in the ground - based light curve compared to that seen in the space - based light curve .",
    "the 2014 _ spitzer _ campaign also resulted in the first satellite parallax measurement for a microlensing exoplanet @xcite . in the case of that event , the precision of @xmath2 via satellite parallax ( @xmath02.5@xmath41 ) was an order of magnitude better than that obtained through orbital parallax ( @xmath022@xmath41 ) , emphasizing the importance of space telescopes for improving the precision on ( @xmath30 , @xmath29 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "an 832-hour _ spitzer _ campaign in 2015 observed 170 additional events , helped to refine the methodology ( see @xcite ) , and led to @xmath2 measurements for a cold neptune in the galactic disk @xcite and a massive stellar remnant @xcite , among other astrophysically interesting objects .          the second channel for converting microlensing observables into the fundamental parameters ( @xmath30 , @xmath29 , @xmath10 ) involves constraining the flux of the primary lensing mass : the host star . determining @xmath5 from color information and finite - source effects and assuming a value for @xmath11 gives one mass - distance relation for the lens system .",
    "then , measuring the lens flux @xmath42 and applying a mass - luminosity relation @xcite provides a second mass - distance relation , given a value of the extinction toward the lens . combining these two allows for the unique determination of ( @xmath30 , @xmath29 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the extinction is known for any line - of - sight within the ogle - iii footprint ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , measuring @xmath42 gives an additional technique for deriving the fundamental parameters of the lensing system .",
    "it is important to note that this does not necessarily require waiting for the lens and source to be resolved .",
    "in fact , there are several ways by which @xmath42 can be constrained , including :    1 .   measuring a color - dependent centroid shift , 2 .   imaging the lens after it is spatially resolved from the source , 3 .   inferring @xmath42 by measuring the elongation of the point spread function ( psf ) of the unresolved microlensing target ( lens+source ) as the lens and source begin to separate , and 4 .   promptly obtaining high - resolution follow - up photometry while the lens and source are unresolved .",
    "@xcite discusses the challenges and possibilities for items 24 specifically in the context of kmtnet planetary detections .",
    "@xcite furthermore identified the subset of past microlensing events with @xmath16 sufficiently high that current high - resolution facilities can spatially resolve the lens and source in @xmath4310 years . here",
    "we focus only on the fourth option .",
    "measuring @xmath42 this way requires near - infrared ( nir ) observations at two different epochs : the first while the source is magnified and the event is ongoing , the second with a high - resolution facility after the event is over and the source has returned to its baseline brightness . by modeling the ground - based light curve , which includes both magnified and unmagnified nir data , the nir flux of the source can be measured precisely .",
    "then , the high - resolution nir observation at baseline will resolve out all stars not dynamically associated with the event to a high probability . by subtracting the nir source flux from the second , unmagnified , observation ,",
    "any detected flux that is in excess of the source flux can be ascribed to the lens , breaking the degeneracy by searching for the light from the planet s possible host .",
    "we note that this excess light could potentially be due to companions to the lens and/or source instead of , or in addition to , the lens itself .",
    "but , this depends on the underling stellar multiplicity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and moreover the contamination from undetected , unknown companions to either lens or source is low @xcite .",
    "the nir flux characterization method has been applied to a handful of planetary events @xcite .",
    "_ k2_c9 represents an extraordinary opportunity to make progress in several regimes of exoplanet demographics . covering 3.7 deg@xmath1",
    ", it will be the first space - based blind survey dedicated to exoplanetary microlensing , facilitating @xmath2 measurements for @xmath3127 events ( see  [ sec : k2_pixels ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the 2014 and 2015 _ spitzer _ programs , which require @xmath34 days between target selection and observation , _ k2_c9 will be able to measure @xmath2 for short - timescale events ( @xmath14 of - order 1 day ) , which are potentially indicative of free - floating planets ( ffps ) .",
    "microlensing s intrinsic sensitivity to bound planets beyond the snow line makes it an indispensable complement to radial velocity , transit , and direct imaging exoplanet searches that seek to improve demographic understanding and provide input for planet formation models .",
    "furthermore , planetary systems with satellite parallax constraints will better our understanding of the frequency and distribution of planets at a wide range of distances from earth .",
    "we lastly note that , as with _ spitzer _ , it will be possible to probe the stellar remnant population @xcite , measure the mass of isolated objects such as stars and brown dwarfs @xcite , and determine the fundamental parameters for binary star systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite announced the discovery of an excess of short - timescale microlensing events , with @xmath44 days , discovered by the moa survey , which they inferred to be caused by a population of  unbound or distant planetary - mass \" objects with masses comparable to that of jupiter and outnumbering main sequence stars by 2:1 .",
    "their results imply that these ffp candidates account for @xmath01.8 @xmath45 of planetary - mass objects per star on the main sequence , as highlighted in figure [ fig : mass_comparison ] .",
    "such a plenitude of ffps stands in stark contrast to observational constraints on bound planetary systems as well as theoretical expectations for ejected planets . combining the detailed statistical analysis of exoplanets discovered by microlensing and radial velocity surveys out to an orbital period of @xmath010@xmath46 d @xcite and including planets with small radii inaccessible to rv surveys and planets orbiting more massive host stars @xcite only accounts for @xmath00.4 @xmath45 of bound planetary mass material per star . extending out to the farthest reaches of stellar systems and adding , optimistically , cold - start - based upper limits from direct imaging searches for loosely bound planets around young stars only allows for , at most , an additional @xmath00.6 @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , current theories of planetary dynamics can not explain the existence of such an abundance of ffps .",
    "for example , simulations by @xcite of the formation and evolution of planetary systems without eccentricity damping eject only @xmath00.04 @xmath45 of planets per star , a rate that is significantly lower than is needed to explain the moa result .",
    "we note that the accounting presented here is extremely rough and is intended to give an idea of the scale of the problem rather than a precise quantitative description .",
    "if the short - timescale events discovered by moa are in fact ffps , these objects must thus dominate the mass budget of planet formation .",
    "additionally , their abundance is severely underestimated by even the most detailed theoretical models of planetary dynamics .",
    "however , short - timescale microlensing events can also be caused by stars with large proper motions in the galactic bulge or low - mass planets that are bound to but widely separated from their host star .",
    "it is thus of crucial importance to investigate the nature of events with short @xmath14 and determine whether they are indeed caused by free - floating planetary - mass objects .",
    "satellite parallax measurements made with _ k2 _ during c9 will help verify whether the cause of each of these short - timescale events is , in fact , a low - mass object .",
    "the nir source flux measurements enabled with ground - based facilities ( see  [ sec : ground ] ) will then set the stage for follow - up high - resolution nir observations that will help distinguish between a planet that is bound to but widely separated from its host star and one that is truly free - floating ( see  [ sec : ulens_flux ] ) .    _",
    "k2_c9 presents another method for vetting ffp candidates .",
    "_ k2 _ will take continuous observations with a photometric precision that may be better than that attained by many ground - based telescopes .",
    "there will thus be two source trajectories , one as seen _ continuously _ by _ kepler _ and one as seen from the earth .",
    "together they increase the geometric probability of detecting potential host stars , and during _ k2_c9",
    "this will be done with an efficiency that is much higher than was possible for the @xcite sample .",
    "figure [ fig : planet_distance ] shows planet mass @xmath29 as a function of planetary system distance from earth @xmath47 for all verified exoplanets , with @xmath29 and @xmath47 data taken from the nasa exoplanet archive @xcite . while the 34 microlensing detections account for only @xmath04@xmath41 of the 844 total such planets , they constitute @xmath040@xmath41 ( 32 out of 78 ) of those with @xmath48 pc and @xmath070@xmath41 ( 26 out of 36 ) of those with @xmath49 pc .",
    "we note that only half of the microlensing - discovered exoplanets have mass constraints either via @xmath2 or nir flux measurements , while the rest rely on characterization through bayesian analysis .",
    "there are thus only 17 microlensing planets ( in 15 systems ) with directly measured distances .    in order to best understand the frequency of planets in different stellar environments",
    ", it is crucial that any selection effects be well understood ( see @xcite ) , a problem made tractable by the _ k2_c9 automated survey .",
    "such an approach will not only then improve our understanding of planet demographics from the solar neighborhood to the galactic bulge but will also allow us to investigate planet frequency in the galactic disk versus the galactic bulge @xcite , or the occurrence rate as a function of , e.g. , metallicity @xcite .",
    "perhaps most compelling is that bound planetary systems with satellite parallax - derived masses and distances are invaluable as we strive toward a comprehensive picture of exoplanet demographics that can reconcile detections obtained using multiple techniques @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified that a repurposed _ kepler _ spacecraft could be utilized as a microlens parallax satellite .",

    "we will briefly describe the plans for all pipelines here , which are being developed and tested on data taken during campaign 0  of the dense open cluster ngc 2158 .",
    "difference image analysis ( dia ; @xcite ) uses convolution to match the psf of a high - quality reference image to that of a generally poorer - quality target image in order to enable the reference image to be subtracted from the target image , leaving only variable objects with non - zero flux in the residuals that comprise the difference image .",
    "it is typically used on well - sampled ground - based images for which the variations in the psf are caused by time - dependent changes in the seeing .",
    "the _ k2 _ data differ significantly from the usual application of dia in that the psf does not differ significantly over the entire data set , and that the psf is severely undersampled , suggesting that without significant modification , standard dia software packages might not work well on _",

    "the _ k2_c9 pipeline based on this method will produce a light curve for every pixel in the _",
    "k2_c9 superstamp , as each pixel will contain several stars ( see figure [ fig : stardensity_cdf ] ) .",
    "quick - look light curves of known microlensing events will be delivered to the exoplanet follow - up observing program ( exofop ) site ( see  [ sec : community_exofop ] ) as soon as they are processed .",
    "a full catalog of light curves for all pixels will be hosted on the nasa exoplanet archive at a date to be determined once the pipeline s performance has been evaluated .",
    "a second difference imaging technique being investigated involves extending the detrending procedure on resolved stars to individual pixels , or combinations of pixels . applying the procedure",
    "to pixel - by - pixel light curves will generate a series of residual images .",
    "these can be used in a similar fashion to classical difference images in that they can be used to identify the locations of variable stars , including microlensing events .",
    "one approach to extracting photometry for variable stars is to combine the modeling of the intrinsic shape of the light curve profile with the detrending procedure . by iteration ,",
    "it is thus possible to find an optimal set of light curve parameters .",
    "this method has been applied to eclipsing binaries within ngc 2158 using a simple model for the shape of the eclipse profiles .",
    "preliminary results have yielded a photometric precision of a few millimag for 15th - magnitude eclipse eclipsing binaries , and this same approach can be taken for microlensing events .",
    "a final methodology involves forward modeling the _ k2 _ images using either star catalogs or higher - resolution ground - based images as the input .",
    "forward modeling refers to the process of producing a generative model of the _ k2 _ data by modeling the process by which stars cause charge to be collected in _",
    "kepler _ s pixels . for our purposes",
    ", this will involve the production of a model image for each 30-minute image from a model of the _ kepler _ pixel response function ( prf ) and a set of input data .",

    "the _ kepler _ prf ( as a function of wavelength and position ) will be fit for ( using well measured _",
    "kepler _ prfs as strong priors ) together with the pointing , roll , and distortion of the focal plane in order to produce each model image .",
    "if , rather than a catalog , ground - based images are used for the input , a convolution kernel that matches the ground - based psf to _ kepler _ s will be fit for instead of the prf itself . because the pipeline for this method will rely on other data and the technique is new and",
    "will likely require more computing power , we expect the outputs of the pipeline to be delayed relative to the dia - based pipeline .",

    "the mst and many members of the larger exoplanetary microlensing community have worked to secure a substantial network of ground - based resources that will observe in concert with _ k2_c9 .",

    "the vast majority of them were alerted to the community via the ogle early warning system @xcite . in its current fourth phase",

    "table [ tab : ground_resources ] provides a detailed list of the parameters of each facility .",
    "the las cumbres observatory global telescope ( lcogt ) network , which consists of multiple telescopes at several northern and southern hemisphere sites , will also perform survey - mode operations during _ k2_c9 . at each of ctio , saao , and",

    "together , ogle - iv , moa - ii , lcogt , and kmtnet will provide the dense coverage necessary to detect microlensing events and , in the case of ogle - iv and moa - ii , generate and circulate alerts for new events on a @xmath0daily timescale .",
    "such information is not only crucial for constructing a database of known microlensing events within the _ k2_c9 superstamp but also for providing real - time updates to targeted follow - up groups ( see  [ sec : ground_followup ] ) and quick - look photometry for real - time modeling analysis ( see  [ sec : realtime_modeling ] ) , which itself is also useful for follow - up observations across all wavelengths .",
    "although the current generation of microlensing surveys are able to observe many square degrees at an @xmath43hourly cadence , there are many advantages of collecting yet higher - cadence follow - up photometry of individual events .",
    "the first is for event characterization . while survey groups are indeed able to detect events as well as the perturbations induced by the presence of a planet , observing at a rate of several times more frequently can provide the most robust interpretation of the lens system , particularly in the case of high - magnification events @xcite .",

    "additionally , the smarts 1.3 m telescope at ctio , the 2.0 m liverpool telescope ( lt ) at la palma , and the 3.0 m infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) at mauna kea , the primary purpose of all of which is for nir source flux measurement for short - timescale events ( see  [ sec : ground_nir ] ) , will take observations in optical bands simultaneous with their nir flux measurements , as each is equipped with a dual - channel optical+nir imager . the parameters of each of these resources is included in table [ tab : ground_resources ] .",
    "multiband time - series photometry plays two critical roles for _ k2_c9 , and in both cases the goal of the observations is to measure the color and magnitude of the source star .",
    "firstly , knowledge of the source color will be invaluable in measuring all parameters of the microlensing events seen from _",
    "kepler_. this is because the events seen by _ kepler _ will be highly blended , and will be in the so - called pixel lensing regime @xcite , wherein the impact parameter @xmath13 , timescale @xmath14 , and the source flux relative to blended light are strongly degenerate ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the impact parameter must be measured in order to determine the parallax , so if the degeneracy is not broken it is only possible to measure one - dimensional parallaxes @xcite . however ,",
    "if the source magnitude in the _ kepler _ bandpass can be inferred from ground - based monitoring of the event in one or more filters , the impact parameter for _ kepler _ can be better constrained .",
    "_ kepler _ s bandpass is broad , covering @xmath108@xmath109  nm , and so covers @xmath110 or @xmath97 bandpasses , though with only partial overlap of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "reconstruction of the source s _ kepler _ magnitude @xmath114 can best be done with knowledge of the source magnitude in several filters that cover the _ kepler _ bandpass ( especially in regions where there is significant differential extinction ) , but it can also be achieved to lesser accuracy with just a single color .",
    "the second application of a source color is the measurement of the source s angular diameter through a color - angular diameter relation .",
    "this becomes important if the microlensing light curve displays finite - source effects , as this allows the conversion of these effects into a measurement of the angular einstein ring radius @xmath5 @xcite , which together with microlens parallax @xmath2 can be used to fully solve the event and measure the lens mass @xmath6 and the lens - source relative parallax @xmath9 ( see  [ sec : ulens_parallax ] ) .",
    "the angular diameter measurements are best made using the widest practical wavelength baseline ; @xmath115 has sufficient baseline and is regularly used in practice , and @xmath116 has a similar baseline but may be more useful in regions of high extinction .",
    "if nir measurements are possible , then visual minus nir colors can be used and may prove to be more accurate .    in all cases , measurements of the source color must be made using time - series photometry in order to separate the varying , magnified source flux from any blended light whose magnitude is constant in time . for short - timescale ffp events , there may not be enough time to alert follow - up observations to obtain multicolor observations , so it is necessary to survey the entire c9 superstamp with a cadence of at least a few hours in each filter in order to ensure the color measurements are possible .",
    "there are several facilities that will contribute the aperture and fov necessary to obtain multiband photometric monitoring across the _",
    "k2_c9 superstamp .",
    "table [ tab : ground_resources ] details the parameters of each of them .",
    "the ogle and moa surveys will obtain occasional @xmath78-band data ( see table [ tab : ground_resources ] ) , which will provide source color measurements for some events .",
    "but , as explained above , it is important to measure the source color for all events , regardless of timescale or magnitude , and to do so in multiple filter combinations and across long wavelength baselines",
    ". the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on mauna kea , with a 3.6 m aperture and 1.0 deg@xmath1 fov , will take @xmath96 data twice per night .",
    "skymapper , a 1.3 m telescope with a 5.6 deg@xmath1 fov located at sso , will cycle through @xmath97 every 23 hours .",
    "the one - degree imager on the wiyn 3.5 m at kitt peak will take @xmath98- and , less frequently , @xmath82-band images .",
    "lastly , the 2.6 m eso - operated vlt survey telescope ( vst ) , which has a 1.0 square - degree fov and is located in cerro paranal , will contribute @xmath78 and @xmath98 observations @xmath03 times per night .",
    "however , even with the involvement from all of these observatories , telescope and instrument scheduling means that the color coverage is not complete over the entire campaign .",
    "there is thus a significant role to be played by follow - up observations .",
    "additionally , there will be no survey - style multiband coverage for events outside the superstamp , so color follow - up observations are essential for interpretation of events monitored by _",
    "k2 _ outside the superstamp .      by tiling the _ k2_c9 superstamp with nir facilities it will be possible to determine the nir source flux of most if not all microlensing events . as discussed in detail in ",
    "[ sec : ulens_flux ] , such an effort will provide a second method by which to directly measure ( @xmath30 , @xmath29 , @xmath10 ) that is independent from @xmath2 .",
    "_ k2_c9 , then , will provide a large control sample with which we can refine and calibrate the flux characterization - derived results with satellite parallax values , which moreover is crucial pathfinding work in advance of _ wfirst _",
    "@xcite , as nir flux characterization may be the dominant mechanism by which to derive the fundamental parameters of the planetary systems _ wfirst _ will detect .",
    "additionally , nir source flux measurements are integral for ultimately deriving the strongest constraints possible on the nature of ffp candidates .",
    "the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) , with a 3.8 m aperture and a 0.20 deg@xmath1 fov , will conduct an automated survey of the _ k2_c9 superstamp through the campaign with a cadence of 23 observations per night . in principle",
    "this will be sufficient to measure the nir source flux for all microlensing events save those with the very shortest timescales .",
    "as these are characteristic of ffps , one of the primary scientific drivers for _ k2_c9 , the mst have worked to procure an array of nir facilities able to trigger nir follow - up for these events . specifically , the smarts 1.3 m at ctio , the irtf at mauna kea , the lt at la palma , and the 1.4 m infrared survey facility ( irsf ) at saao will all target individual microlensing events to guarantee nir source flux measurements . additionally , the 8.2 m subaru telescope , located at mauna kea , will contribute two hours of targeted follow - up in nir bands on 24/june .",
    "a final , experimental venture to this end is the use of nirc2 on keck to trigger target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations of hand - picked short - timescale events .",
    "the mst was awarded four such too triggers during _ k2_c9 , the goal being to obtain the first epoch of magnified nir data for short - timescale ffp candidates described in  [ sec : ulens_flux ] .",
    "it is true that all of the nir resources that have hitherto been discussed are able to accomplish this task .",
    "nevertheless , as the second epoch must necessarily be taken with a high - resolution facility , taking the first epoch using the same instrument on the same telescope allows for the strongest possible lens flux constraints . in table",
    "[ tab : ground_resources ] we provide a catalog of the parameters of all observatories .      along with the aggregation of telescopes listed above",
    ", a real - time modeling effort will be essential to the success of _ k2_c9 . while _",
    "k2 _ itself and many of the ground - based facilities will operate in an automated fashion , all targeted data collection efforts , and in particular those contributing nir imagers , will benefit from and rely on some form of real - time event analysis . this capability helps efficaciously allocate resources to events with high observational and/or scientific priority via rapid interpretation of the temporal evolution of the events . in specific",
    ", predictions by real - time modeling efforts help to predict caustic crossings in order to guarantee the dense observations necessary to constrain the microlensing observables ( see  [ sec : ulens_geometry ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the rapid and robust determination of short - timescale microlensing events is crucial for any nir facilities . having a well - developed modeling pipeline is of paramount importance for eliminating false positives and utilizing the keck too triggers on the candidates most likely to yield secure ffp detections",
    ". a prompt classification of anomalous events can also be useful for deploying additional too facilities for genuine planetary events , identifying stellar binary contaminants , and preventing the use of expensive facilities on less interesting events .    within the microlensing community",
    ", there are several active groups providing real - time modeling of binary and planetary events .",
    "these groups have developed their own codes using different algorithms that naturally provide independent checks for the proposed solutions .",
    "the modeling of binary microlensing events is made particularly difficult by the existence of caustics ( see  [ sec : ulens_geometry ] ) , which rapidly change their shapes for small variations in the parameters and may abruptly create peaks or dips in the light curves .",
    "for this reason , many disconnected local minima for the chi - squared function can coexist in the parameter space . with the purpose of making the exploration as exhaustive and fast as possible ,",
    "two strategies have been proposed to set the initial conditions of downhill fitting : a grid search in the parameter space , or template - matching from a wide library of light curves @xcite .",
    "the latter is the strategy adopted by the fully automatic platform rtmodel , which is able to provide predictions for the light curves as seen by _ kepler _ using available ground - based observations .",
    "from june 18 to july 26  in 2016 , _ spitzer _ will also be able to observe the galactic bulge , leading to a 13-day overlap with the _ k2_c9 window .",
    "gould , yee , and carey have an accepted _ spitzer _ program to conduct a two - satellite microlensing experiment ( pi : a.  gould , @xcite ) .",
    "the primary goal of this _",
    "k2 _ plus _ spitzer _ endeavor is to demonstrate the idea of using an additional satellite to break the four - fold degeneracy that is present in the case of observations from a single - satellite ( in addition to those from the ground ) @xcite . in a single - satellite experiment",
    "k2_c9 or _ spitzer _ ) , the microlens parallax vector is given by : @xmath117 here @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the differences in the peak times and impact parameters as seen from the two sites , respectively . while the light curves can yield @xmath120 and @xmath121 unambiguously",
    ", they can only yield the absolute values of impact parameters , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "hence , equation  ( [ eq : pievec ] ) is four - fold ambiguous ( see , e.g. , figure 1 of @xcite ) : @xmath124 this degeneracy typically leads to two distinct solutions for the lens mass and distance .",
    "the four - fold degeneracy can be broken in specific cases , such as planetary events , high - magnification events , or events with kinematic information @xcite , and can be approached statistically for a sample of events @xcite .",
    "however , it can only be systematically broken by obtaining observations from a second , misaligned , satellite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the addition of _ spitzer _ ( _ kepler _ ) to _ kepler _ ( _ spitzer _ ) fulfills such a requirement , as is shown in figure  [ fig : k2_spitzer_positions ] .",
    "figure [ fig : k2_spitzer_break_degeneracy ] shows the light curve for an event with parameters typical of a lens in the galactic disk as seen by the earth , _ kepler _ , and _ spitzer_. observations with _",
    "spitzer _ can easily identify the correct solution , leading to the unique determination of @xmath2 . when combined with a measurement of @xmath5 or the lens flux ,",
    "this uniquely solves for the lens mass and distance .",
    "an ensemble of single - lens events for which the four - fold degeneracy has been broken can be used to test the rich argument .",
    "rich s argument , which asserts that the parallactic shift in impact parameter , @xmath125 , should be the same order as the parallax - induced shift in @xmath12 , @xmath126 , is used to statistically break the four - fold degeneracy @xcite . for events with @xmath5 measurements ,",
    "the resolution of this four - fold degeneracy can directly yield precise mass and distance measurements of the lens system without requiring any additional arguments or observations @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a second satellite can also break the 1-d continuous parallax degeneracy that can be present in events with a binary lens system .",
    "since @xmath5 is nearly always measured in such cases , this leads to more precise measurement of the mass of the binary lens .    with 50 hours of _ spitzer _",
    "time , @xmath025 events that fall inside the _ k2_c9 superstamp are expected to be observed .",
    "this subset will include several binaries that remain active when _ spitzer _ observations begin , and @xmath020 relatively bright single - lens events selected from a sample of @xmath050 events that will peak within a 30-day window that is centered on june 24 , the midpoint of the 13-day overlap window .",
    "these events will follow the standard _ spitzer _",
