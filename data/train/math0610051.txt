    "this paper introduces a general - purpose algorithm to compute the action of linear operators which are frequently encountered in analysis and scientific computing .",
    "these operators take the form @xmath12 where @xmath5 is a smooth phase function obeying the homogeneity relation @xmath13 for @xmath14 positive , and @xmath4 is a smooth amplitude term . as is standard",
    ", @xmath15 is the fourier transform of @xmath3 defined by @xmath16 with the proper regularity assumptions on the phase and amplitude to be detailed later , defines a class of oscillatory integrals known as fourier integral operators ( fios ) .",
    "fios are the subject of considerable study for many of the operators encountered in physics and other fields are of this form .",
    "for instance , most differential and pseudodifferential operators are fios .",
    "convolutions and multiplications by smooth functions are fios .",
    "some `` principal value '' integrals are fios .",
    "and the list goes on .",
    "an especially important example of fio is the solution operator to the free - space wave equation in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 with initial conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , say .",
    "everyone knows that for constant speeds , the fourier transform decouples the different frequency components of @xmath22 .",
    "each fourier component obeys an ordinary differential equation which can be solved explicitly .",
    "the solution @xmath23 is the superposition of these fourier modes and is given by @xmath24 the connection is now clear : the solution operator is the sum of two fourier integral operators with phase functions @xmath25 for variable but reasonably smooth sound speeds @xmath26 , the solution operator is for small times a sum of two fios with more complicated phases and amplitudes .",
    "in particular , the phase can be constructed from the optical traveltime in a medium with index of refraction @xmath27 , see @xcite for details .    in short ,",
    "it is useful to think of fios as proxies for the solution operator to large classes of hyperbolic differential equations .",
    "numerical simulation of free wave propagation with constant sound speed is straightforward .",
    "as long as the solution @xmath23 is sufficiently well localized both in space and frequency , it can be computed accurately and rapidly by applying the sequence of steps below .    1 .",
    "compute the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   multiply the result by @xmath29 , and sum as in ( [ eq : wave_solution ] ) .",
    "3 .   compute the inverse fft .",
    "of course , this only works in the very special case where the amplitude @xmath30 is independent of @xmath31 , and where the phase is of the form @xmath32 plus a function of @xmath1 alone",
    ". expressed differently , this works when the fio is shift - invariant so that it is diagonal in the fourier basis .",
    "note that there is in general no formula for the eigenfunctions when @xmath33 or @xmath30 depend on @xmath31 .",
    "computing these eigenfunctions on the fly is out of the question when the objective is merely to compute the action of the operator .",
    "( note that even if the spectral decomposition of the operator were available , it is not clear how one would use it to speed up computations . )    the object of this paper is to find an algorithm that is considerably faster than evaluating by direct quadratures , and is yet suited to handle large classes of phases and amplitudes .",
    "most of the existing fast summation techniques rely on either the non - oscillatory behavior ( such as wavelet based techniques @xcite ) or the existence of a low rank approximation ( fast multipole methods @xcite , hierarchical matrices @xcite , pseudodifferential separation @xcite ) . the difficulty here is that the kernel @xmath34 is highly oscillatory and does not have a low rank separated approximation",
    ". therefore , all the modern techniques are not directly applicable .    the main claim of this paper ,",
    "however , is that there is a way to decompose the operator into a sum of components for which the oscillations are well - understood and low - rank representations are available . in addition , the number of such components is reasonably small which paves the way to faster algorithms . before expanding on this idea",
    ", we first explain the discretization of the operator .      for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our attention in this paper to the two dimensional case @xmath35 .",
    "the situation in which @xmath36 is exactly the same .",
    "just as the discrete fourier transform is the digital analogue of the continuous fourier transform , one can also introduce discrete fourier integral operators .",
    "given a function @xmath3 defined on a cartesian grid @xmath37 , we simply define the discrete fourier integral operator by @xmath38 for every @xmath39 .",
    "( we are sorry for overloading the symbol @xmath40 to denote both the discrete and continuous object but there will be no confusion in the sequel . )",
    "the summation above is taken over all @xmath41 and throughout this paper , we will assume that @xmath7 is an even integer . here and below",
    ", @xmath42 is the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of @xmath3 and is defined as @xmath43 the normalizing constant @xmath44 in ( resp .  )",
    "ensures that @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "the dft ) is a discrete isometry in the case where @xmath45 .",
    "the formula turns out to be an accurate discretization of ( [ eq : fio ] ) as soon as @xmath3 obeys standard localization estimates both in space and frequency .",
    "a justification of this fact would however go beyond the scope of this paper , and is omitted . in the remainder of the paper , we will take ( [ eq : dfio ] ) as the quantity we wish to compute once we are given a phase and an amplitude function .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 measures the size and difficulty of the computational problem . in a nutshell",
    ", it corresponds to the number of points which are needed in each direction to accurately sample the continuous object @xmath46 .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath7 will be a central quantity throughout the rest of paper .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the straightforward method for computing simply evaluates the summation independently for each @xmath31 .",
    "since each sum takes @xmath47 operations and there are @xmath48 grid points in @xmath49 , this strategy requires @xmath8 operations .",
    "when @xmath7 is moderately large , this can be prohibitive .",
    "this paper describes a novel algorithm which computes all the values of @xmath50 for @xmath51 with high accuracy in @xmath9 operations .",
    "the only requirement is that the amplitude and the phase obey mild smoothness conditions , which are in fact standard .",
    "this section outlines the main idea of the paper .",
    "let @xmath52 be the angle between @xmath1 and the horizontal vector @xmath53 , and partition the frequency domain into a family of angular wedges @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( assume @xmath57 is an integer ) .",
    "an important property of these wedges is that each @xmath58 satisfies the parabolic relationship @xmath59 up to multiplicative constants independent of @xmath7 .",
    "there are @xmath10 such wedges , as illustrated in figure [ fig : wedge ] .    for each wedge",
    "@xmath58 , we let @xmath60 be the indicator function of @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , we denote by @xmath61 the unit vector pointing to the center direction of @xmath58 @xmath62 it follows from the identify @xmath63 that one can decompose the operator @xmath40 as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 within each wedge @xmath58 , we can perform a taylor expansion of @xmath5 in the second variable , around the point @xmath66 .",
    "there is a point @xmath67 which belongs to the line segment @xmath68 $ ] such that @xmath69 by homogeneity of the phase ( @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) , it holds that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the first and third terms in the above expression cancel and thus @xmath74 the first term @xmath75 , which is linear in @xmath1 , is called _ the linearized phase _ and poses no problem as we will see later on .",
    "the rest , denoted as @xmath76 and called _ the residual phase _",
    ", is of order @xmath77 for @xmath78 , independently of @xmath7 .",
    "this follows from @xmath79 since @xmath5 is homogeneous of degree @xmath80 in @xmath1 , together with @xmath81 for all @xmath82 , which uses the fact that the shape of @xmath58 obeys the parabolic relationship .",
    "equiangular wedges.,height=192 ]    because the residual phase @xmath83 is of order @xmath77 independently of @xmath7 , we say that the function @xmath84 is _",
    "nonoscillatory_. under mild assumptions , this observation guarantees the existence of a low rank separated representation which decouples the variables @xmath31 and @xmath1 and approximates the complex exponential very well .",
    "define the @xmath85-separation rank of a function @xmath86 of two variables as the smallest integer @xmath87 for which there exists @xmath88 , @xmath89 such that @xmath90 then we prove the following theorem in section [ sec : analy ] .    *",
    "* for all @xmath91 , there exist @xmath92 and @xmath93 such that for all @xmath94 , the @xmath85-separation rank of @xmath95 for @xmath96 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath97 obeys @xmath98 in section [ sec : analy ] we make explicit the values of the constants @xmath99 and @xmath100 by relating them , among other things , to the smoothness of @xmath33 and the angular span of @xmath58",
    ". we will also provide results in the case where @xmath101 , and explain why the separation rank for the amplitude is also under control .",
    "the point of the theorem is that the bound on the @xmath85-rank does not grow as a function of @xmath7in fact , the threshold condition on @xmath7 indicates that the @xmath85-rank _ decays _ as @xmath7 grows .",
    "the logarithmic dependence on @xmath85 is the signature of what is usually called spectral accuracy .",
    "note that the decomposition into frequency wedges obeying the parabolic scaling has a long history in mathematics . a multiscale version of this partitioning , the second dyadic decomposition , was introduced by fefferman in 1973 for the study of bochner - riesz multipliers @xcite , and used by seeger , sogge and stein in 1991 to prove a sharp @xmath102-boundedness result for fio @xcite .",
    "more recently , it also served as the basis for the construction of curvelets , with applications to sparsity of fios and related results for wave equations @xcite .",
    "the low - rank separated representation provided by the theorem above offers us a way to compute efficiently with high accuracy .",
    "each term in the decomposition @xmath103 can be further simplified as follows : @xmath104 .",
    "\\label{eq : dfioalgo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our analysis guarantees that the sum over @xmath105 can be truncated to a fixed , hopefully small number of terms without significant loss of precision .    in order to carry out the final summation over @xmath105 , we first need to construct the functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "sections [ sec : algo - dete ] and [ sec : algo - rand ] discuss two different methods to find these functions . in section [ sec : algo - dete ] we present an elementary deterministic approach , while in section [ sec : algo - rand ] we present a randomized approach that offers better efficiency both timewise and storagewise .",
    "assuming that @xmath106 and @xmath108 are available for all values of @xmath109 and @xmath105 , the computation of @xmath110 for a given @xmath3 consists of the following 4 steps :    1 .",
    "fourier transform @xmath3 by means of the fft to get @xmath42 .",
    "2 .   choose a bound @xmath111 greater than the @xmath112-rank @xmath113 .",
    "for each @xmath109 and @xmath114 , form @xmath115 .",
    "3 .   for each @xmath109 and @xmath114 ,",
    "compute @xmath116 by means of a nonuniform fft algorithm .",
    "4 .   compute @xmath117 .",
    "the only step that require further discussion is the computation of @xmath118 .",
    "we defer the details to section [ sec : algo - eval ] .",
    "it is instructive to understand why linearizing the phase is so important .",
    "if we disregard the error introduced by the discretization in @xmath1 , we observe that @xmath119 is simply @xmath120 the interpretation of an oscillatory integral in the fourier domain as a diffeomorphism is only possible when the phase is linear in @xmath1 .",
    "for each @xmath109 and @xmath105 , the computation of @xmath118 which is an interpolation problem , is therefore much simpler problem than applying the original operator .",
    "admittedly , diffeomorphisms do not provide accurate approximations to fios over angular wedges , but the content of our analysis in section [ sec : analy ] shows that the computational budget to make up for the residual is safely under control .",
    "applying nontrivial fios repeatedly is a daunting task that has proved to be the computational bottleneck in various inverse problems .",
    "there is serious scientific as well as industrial interest in speeding up fio computations , and accordingly a lot of resources have been invested over the past decades in engineering better codes .",
    "we believe that the ideas introduced in this paper provide new directions . to explain and illustrate this contrast ,",
    "let us consider an example from the field of reflection seismology : kirchhoff migration .",
    "the problem is to produce an image of the discontinuities in the earth s upper crust from seismograms , i.e. , wave measurements @xmath121 parameterized by time @xmath105 and receiver coordinate @xmath122 .",
    "glossing over the details , the core of kirchhoff migration consists in integrating several different functions @xmath121 over a fixed set of curves , parameterized as the level lines of some traveltime function @xmath123 : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is for us a fixed parameter ( the source coordinate ) .",
    "we do not expect the reader unfamiliar with seismic imaging to understand all the physics underlying this equation .",
    "anyone interested in details may want to consult @xcite , for example .",
    "this collection of integrals is called a generalized radon transform ( grt ) , or in the field of image processing , a hough transform .",
    "( for convenience , the appendix explains why integration along ellipses  a simple grt  is a sum of two fios . )",
    "a useful notation for kirchhoff migration is @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is called the imaging operator .",
    "the standard algorithm for applying the imaging operator is a simple quadrature of @xmath121 , interpolated and integrated along each curve @xmath128 ( parameterized by @xmath31 . ) if the data @xmath121 oscillates at a wavelength comparable to the grid spacing @xmath129 , then an accurate quadrature on a smooth curve requires @xmath130 points . since @xmath31 takes on @xmath47 values , the curve integration results in a total complexity of @xmath131 for applying the imaging operator ( which is of course better than the @xmath8 complexity of the naive summation . )    in reality , the true @xmath127 is only approximated by a grt .",
    "the derivation of the expression for @xmath127 from the wave equation reveals that if the geometry of the optical rays is not too complex , @xmath127 is in fact closer to an fio than a grt @xcite .",
    "this is akin to the observation that the retarded propagator of the wave equation in 2d is not a distribution strictly supported on the boundary of the light cone  only its singular support is the boundary of the cone . how to compute",
    "the action of an operator with such a singular kernel is much less obvious .",
    "the direct summation along curves provides a fragile , restricted paradigm for curvilinear integrals , the same way the fft provides a fragile setting for shift - invariant problems .",
    "the advantages of our algorithm should now be clear : very general fios can be handled with an asymptotic computational complexity which is lower than that required for grt summation , i.e. ( @xmath9 vs. @xmath131 ) , and this without making any curvilinear approximation . the other argument in favor of the grt method is the typically low memory usage .",
    "but this equally applies to our method .",
    "we will show that the storage overhead ( on top of storing the phase and amplitude ) is negligible and scales like @xmath10 .",
    "we only discussed applications to reflection seismology , but there are many other areas where nontrivial fios are computed routinely , e.g. as part of solving an inverse problem . examples in radar imaging , ultrasound imaging , and electron microscopy",
    "all come to mind .",
    "some hough transforms for feature detection in image processing can also be formulated as fios . in short",
    ", the ideas presented in this paper may enable the speed up of fundamental computations in a variety of problem areas .",
    "in the case where @xmath45 , the operator is said to be pseudodifferential . in this",
    "simpler setting , it is known that separated variables expansions of the symbol @xmath4 are good strategies for reducing complexity .",
    "for instance , bao and symes @xcite propose a numerical method based on a fourier series expansion of the symbol in the angular variable arg @xmath1 , and a polyhomogeneous expansion in @xmath6 , which is a particularly effective example of separation of variables .",
    "another popular approach for compressing operators is to decompose them in a well - chosen , possibly adaptive basis of @xmath132 .",
    "once a sparse representation is achieved , evaluation simply consists of applying a sparse matrix in the transformed domain . in the case of 1d oscillatory integrals ,",
    "this program was advocated and carried out by bradie et al .",
    "@xcite and averbuch et al .",
    "@xcite . in spite of these successes , the generalization to multiple dimensions",
    "has so far remained an open problem .",
    "we will come back to this question in section [ sec : disc ] , and in particular discuss the relationship with modern multiscale transformations such as curvelets @xcite and wave atoms @xcite .",
    "we would also like to acknowledge the line of research related to filon - type quadratures for oscillatory integrals @xcite .",
    "when the integrand is of the form @xmath133 with @xmath134 smooth and @xmath135 large , it is not always necessary to sample the integrand at the nyquist rate .",
    "for instance , integration of a polynomial interpolant of @xmath134 ( filon quadrature ) provides an accurate approximation to @xmath136 using fewer and fewer evaluations of the function @xmath134 as @xmath137 . while these ideas are important , they are not directly applicable in the case of fios .",
    "the reasons are threefold .",
    "first , we make no notable assumption on the support of the function to which the operator is applied , meaning that the oscillations of @xmath138 may be on the same scale as those of the exponential @xmath34 .",
    "second the phase does not in general have a simple formula that would lend itself to precomputations . and third",
    ", filon - type quadratures do not address the problem of simplifying computations of _ several _ such oscillatory integrals at once ( i.e. computing a family of integrals indexed by @xmath31 in the case of fios ) .",
    "finally , we remark that fios are also interesting when the canonical relation is nontrivial  that is , multivalued phase  because they allow to study propagation of singularities of hyperbolic equations in regimes of multipathing and caustics @xcite . to mathematicians taking this specialized viewpoint",
    ", the focus of this paper may appear restrictive .",
    "our outlook and ambition are different .",
    "we find fios to be interesting mathematical objects even when the canonical relation is a graph and degenerates to the gradient of a phase .",
    "our concern is to understand their structure from an operational standpoint and exploit it to design efficient numerical algorithms .",
    "in fact , we expect this paper to be the first of a projected series which will eventually deal with more complex setups .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : analy ] proves all the analytical estimates which support our methodology . in section [ sec : algo ] , we describe algorithms for constructing the low rank separated approximation , evaluating @xmath139 , as well as for evaluating its adjoint , namely , computing @xmath140 .",
    "numerical examples in section [ sec : results ] illustrate the properties of our algorithms .",
    "finally , section [ sec : disc ] discusses some related work and potential alternatives .",
    "in this section , we return to a description of the problem in continuous variables @xmath31 and @xmath1 to prove estimates on the separation rank of @xmath95 , where @xmath83 is the residual phase after linearization about @xmath61 .",
    "we begin with a lemma which concerns the separation of the exponential function and whose variations play a central role in modern numerical analysis .",

    "the proof is very simple .",
    "we start with @xmath152 it is now straightforward algebra to check that the condition @xmath153 suffices to bound the right - hand - side by @xmath85 .",
    "since the @xmath85-rank @xmath87 is integer - valued , the estimate on @xmath154 may need to be rounded up to the next integer , hence the precaution of incrementing the bounds in ( [ eq : r_epsilon1 ] ) and ( [ eq : r_epsilon2 ] ) by one .    in the next section",
    "we will make use of lemma [ teo : sep_exp ] to prove that the nonoscillatory factor @xmath95 has a separation rank which is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "the other factor in the kernel @xmath155 , namely , the amplitude @xmath4 is in general a simpler object to study .",
    "the standard assumption in the literature , and also in applications , is to assume that @xmath4 is a smooth symbol of order zero and type @xmath53 , meaning that for each pair of integers @xmath156 , there is a positive constant @xmath157 obeying latexmath:[\\[|{\\partial}^\\alpha_\\xi { \\partial}^\\beta_x a(x,\\xi)| \\leq c_{\\alpha \\beta } ( 1 +    @xmath4 is compactly supported in @xmath31 are themselves compactly supported in situations of interest , which ought to be the case for accurate numerical computations . ] .",
    "the nice separation properties of @xmath30 are simple consequences of its assumed smoothness .",
    "assume @xmath4 is a symbol of order zero .",
    "then for all @xmath159 there exists @xmath160 such that for all @xmath144 , the @xmath85-rank for the separation of @xmath31 and @xmath1 in @xmath4 obeys @xmath161    perform a fourier transform of the @xmath162 , compactly supported function @xmath163 .",

    "our situation is different .",

    "but the point is that our matrix has a special structure .",
    "as we argued earlier , the columns of @xmath213 are often highly correlated and we believe that this is the reason why the randomized subsampling performs well .    a recent article by martinsson , rokhlin and tygert @xcite presents a new randomized solution to the same problem .",
    "the only inconvenience of this algorithm , probably inevitable for general matrices , is that one needs to visit all the entries of the matrix multiple times",

    "whenever this is not true , one might be forced to store these matrices , which could be quite costly .",

    "however , as long as the interaction is low rank , @xmath357 and @xmath358 have far fewer objects than @xmath354 and @xmath355 , so that @xmath367 only uses very little storage .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that , instead of representing the interaction from @xmath358 ( a subset of @xmath355 ) to @xmath357 ( a subset of @xmath354 ) , @xmath367 is a reverse interaction .",

    "<S> we introduce a general purpose algorithm for rapidly computing certain types of oscillatory integrals which frequently arise in problems connected to wave propagation and general hyperbolic equations . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is to evaluate numerically a so - called fourier integral operator ( fio ) of the form @xmath0 at points given on a cartesian grid . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 is a frequency variable , @xmath2 is the fourier transform of the input @xmath3 , @xmath4 is an amplitude and @xmath5 is a phase function , which is typically as large as @xmath6 ; hence the integral is highly oscillatory at high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> because an fio is a dense matrix , a naive matrix vector product with an input given on a cartesian grid of size @xmath7 by @xmath7 would require @xmath8 operations .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper develops a new numerical algorithm which requires @xmath9 operations , and as low as @xmath10 in storage space . </S>",
    "<S> it operates by localizing the integral over polar wedges with small angular aperture in the frequency plane . on each wedge , the algorithm factorizes the kernel @xmath11 into two components : 1 ) a diffeomorphism which is handled by means of a nonuniform fft and 2 ) a residual factor which is handled by numerical separation of the spatial and frequency variables . </S>",
    "<S> the key to the complexity and accuracy estimates is that the separation rank of the residual kernel is _ provably independent of the problem size_. several numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodology . </S>",
