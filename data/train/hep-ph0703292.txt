    "various methods related to @xmath9 decays have been proposed to determine the ut angle @xmath0 . within them , the one that gives the best error on @xmath0 is the dalitz method @xcite@xcite .",
    "we propose to measure the angle @xmath0 using a dalitz analysis applied to neutral b mesons . in general , since the neutral b mesons mix , interference effects between @xmath10 and @xmath11 decay amplitudes in @xmath12 decays ( for instance into @xmath13 final states ) are studied for the determination of the combination of ut angles @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the tagging technique and a time dependent analysis are required .",
    "this can be avoided if the final states contain a particle which allows to unambiguously identify if a @xmath12 or @xmath15 has decayed . this is the case of neutral b mesons decaying into @xmath16 $ ] final states , where the flavor of the b meson can be determined through the sign of the electric charge of the kaon .",
    "one of the relevant parameter in those kind of analysis is the ratio between the @xmath11 and @xmath10 amplitudes , which can be expressed by :    @xmath17    the sensitivity to @xmath0 is proportional to the @xmath18 value . considering the ckm factors in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 transitions and the fact that in both cases the processes are mediated by a color suppressed diagram , we expect @xmath19 to be in the range [ 0.3 - 0.5 ] , larger than for the equivalent ratio in the charged b sector , which has been found to be of the order 0.1  @xcite .",
    "in the analysis on data we would perform an unbinned maximum likelihood fit in order to extract the interesting quantities : the likelihood will contain a product of a yields pdf and a cp pdf ( only the latter has , within its variables , the weak phase @xmath0 ) .    in our feasibility study , we assume the yields pdf to be a function of the classic babar analysis variable @xmath20 , where the asterisk denotes evaluation in the @xmath21 cm frame ] and of a variable that is able to discriminate between @xmath22 and continuum events ( @xmath23 events , with @xmath24 ) .",
    "for the distributions of those variables we make some realistic assumptions inspired by babar analysis .    in writing the cp pdf , we have an additional difficulty , with respect to the @xmath25 dalitz analysis .",
    "this is due to the fact that the natural width of the @xmath26 is not small ( @xmath2750  ) and hence the interference with the other @xmath28 processes may not be negligible .",
    "we follow the formalism introduced in  @xcite and also used in the @xmath29 babar analysis in order to solve this problem .",
    "we introduce the effective quantities @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 defined as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 for the schwartz inequality and @xmath35 $ ] . in the limit of a @xmath362-body decay , such as @xmath37 we have : @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( the phase difference between the @xmath40 and the @xmath41 amplitudes of eq.[eq : rb ] ) and k=1 .",

    "( [ eq : rs_square ] ) and  ( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "we have simplified the notation using @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the dalitz structure of the decay @xmath57 is well known and it has already been used in dalitz analysis in the charged b sector @xcite @xcite .",
    "we performe a study to evaluate the possible variation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 on the b dalitz plot . for this purpose",
    "we use a b dalitz model as suggested by the recent measurements @xcite , @xcite . the model assumed for the decay parametrizes the amplitude @xmath58 at each point @xmath31 of the dalitz plot as a sum of two - body decay matrix elements and a non - resonant term according to the following expression : @xmath59 we consider a region within @xmath60 48 mev from the nominal mass of the @xmath26(892 ) resonance and we obtain the distribution of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath61 by randomly varying all the strong phases between [ 0 - 2@xmath62 and the amplitudes up to @xmath63 of their nominal value ( shown in table [ tab : b0 ] ) . only for the @xmath64 resonance ,",
    "the variation is up to @xmath65 of its nominal value .",

    "the last two columns present the chosen values of the coefficients @xmath68 for the @xmath41 and @xmath40 transitions respectively . note that the phase @xmath69 are not indicated and their choice is arbitrary . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we conclude that , with the now available babar statistics , the measurement strategy would be extracting from the fit @xmath0 as a scan with respect to @xmath18 ( i.e. by performing a likelihood scan on @xmath0 for each value of @xmath18 with @xmath0 , @xmath70 and all the yields parameters floated in the fit ) .    in this way we would extract from data the maximum possible information for the available statistics : an information on @xmath0 and not on @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution obtained in that way , already very interesting on its own , would be very precious when combined with an experimental input for @xmath18 .",
    "the coverage tests on toy - mc generated with different values of @xmath30 show that we have no bias in this fit configuration .",
    "in this section we show , on one chosen toy - mc , what would be the impact of a real mesurement . in figure",
    "[ fig : gammascan_rbfix_toy ] we show the output of our fit : a likelihood scan of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "this distribution , when combined with a fake @xmath30 measurement ( @xmath71 ) gives @xmath0 with an error of @xmath72 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath30 with such an error is what we could expect to obtain , if @xmath73 , on @xmath74 data from an analysis of @xmath75 with the @xmath4 in flavor modes .",
    "clearly , this is just a example on a chosen toy - mc and it is not necessarily representative of what we will find on data .",
    "indeed we found , on toy - mc studies , that in a small percentage of cases we can be much less sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "that problem has been found to depend on the low number of signal events ( such that in some cases those events happen to be in poorly sensitive regions of the @xmath4 dalitz plot ) and it will therefore disappear with the increasing of the statistics . still , our test shows that we could have a result on @xmath0 that is competitive with the charged b dalitz analysis ( the analysis made on babar data gives today an error on @xmath0 of @xmath76 ) .",
