    "among the most precisely measured electroweak observables the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath1 , the muon decay constant , @xmath2 , the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath3 , and the ratio of charged to neutral current cross - sections in semi - leptonic neutrino scattering , feature prominently . because of their high experimental precision @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are commonly used as input in calculations of electroweak radiative corrections . until relatively recently the experimental errors on @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "were entirely negligible compared to those on the third input quantity , @xmath4 .",
    "now , however , both @xmath2 and @xmath4 are both measured to 2 parts in @xmath5 .",
    "any further improvement on the accuracy of @xmath4 would mean that the measurement of the muon lifetime in principle limits the accuracy with which electroweak theory can be tested .    in this arena ,",
    "theoretical calculations currently lag experiment .",
    "calculations are not available that could exploit the @xmath6 accuracy available on @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is therefore of technical interest and practical necessity to develop electroweak calculations that approach the @xmath7 accuracy of experiment .",
    "while a full 2-loop calculation would be ideal , it is likely that the analytic form of such results would be too complicated to usefully write down .",
    "one would therefore probably wish to rely on computer algebra and integration to obtain numerical results @xcite .",
    "however it is still true that certain dominant subclasses of 2-loop diagrams can be calculated and written down in compact analytic form @xcite .",
    "such results are , of course , always preferable to numerical ones .",
    "the set of 2-loop feynman diagrams containing one fermion loop are such a class . these we will refer to as @xmath0 corrections where @xmath8 is the number of fermions and @xmath9 is the number of complete generations . in these corrections",
    "we will assume that fermions are massless which is an excellent approximation for all but the third generation .",
    "the @xmath0 results can be used either with @xmath10 and mass corrections computed for the third generation or @xmath11 and corrections for the third generation computed separately .    because @xmath8 is quite large",
    " up to 24  the @xmath0 corrections are expected to be a dominant subset of 2-loop graphs and since @xmath8 provides a unique tag , the complete set of @xmath0 corrections contributing to a particular physical process will form a gauge - invariant set .",
    "diagrams of this type have been considered in connection with the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .    _",
    "a priori _ the @xmath0 corrections can be expected to contribute at the level of @xmath12 . without their calculation and inclusion , theoretical predictions are uncertain at this level .    to test the standard model",
    ", one needs at least four well - measured electroweak observables .",
    "three of these are used as input to the model and the fourth is then predicted and can be compared with experimental determinations . in addition , relating electroweak parameters , such as @xmath4 , extracted at high energies with those , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , extracted at low energies inevitably involves an uncertainty arising from the hadronic contribution to the photon vacuum polarization , @xmath13 .",
    "this hadronic uncertainty can be reduced by improved measurements of the cross - section @xmath14 and the use of dispersion relations @xcite or eliminated completely by sacrificing one high precision observable @xcite .    at present the fourth well - measured electroweak observable , needed to test the standard model at very high precision ,",
    "is missing but it is not unlikely that quantities , such as the polarization asymmetry , @xmath15 , or @xmath3 of the muon , could fulfill this rle in the foreseeable future . in any event",
    "the calculation of the @xmath0 electroweak radiative corrections are a necessary prerequisite to be able exploit the extremely accurate experimental measurement that are the legacy of lep .",
    "in what follows the general coupling of a fermion to a vector boson will be denoted @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the usual left- and right - handed helicity projection operators and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the corresponding coupling constants .",
    "we assume throughout an anticommuting @xmath21 .",
    "a euclidean metric with the square of time - like momenta being negative will be used and all calculations will be done in @xmath22 gauge . the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle @xmath23 will be denoted @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "we will be interested in the @xmath0 corrections for massless fermions . in corresponding feynman diagrams the fermions couple only to vector bosons and never to goldstones or the physical higgs particle .",
    "many , but by no means all , such diagrams are obtained simply by inserting a fermion loop into the boson propagator of a one - loop diagram , see fig.1a . because the original one - loop diagram is logarithmically divergent",
    ", the fermion loop insertion will need to be calculated to @xmath26 in dimensional regularization , where @xmath27 is the dimension of space - time .",
    "it turns out , however , that for all @xmath0 diagrams for low - energy processes , it is possible to obtain expressions that are exact in @xmath27 .    for the massless fermion loop insertion , it may be shown that @xmath28 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 of the couplings of the attached vector bosons .",
    "a number of special cases of low energy 2-loop integrals have appeared in the literature @xcite . by using the projection operator techniques described in the following sections , most @xmath0 diagrams occurring in low - energy electroweak processes , including box diagrams , can be reduced to expressions involving a general master integral of the form @xmath31^j[p^2+m^2]^k } \\int\\frac{d^nq}{i\\pi^2}\\frac{1}{[q^2]^l[(q+p)^2]^m } \\label{eq : masterintdef}\\ ] ] provided the diagram contains at least one massive boson .",
    "the only exceptions to this are certain contributions to the photon vacuum polarization . in that case some diagrams must be calculated retaining the fermion mass , @xmath32 , and then applying the asymptotic expansion of ref.@xcite before taking the limit @xmath33 .",
    "other @xmath0 diagrams that can not be expressed in terms of the integral ( [ eq : masterintdef ] ) are of the pure qed type containing only internal photons and fermions .",
    "the relevant master integrals for this case can be found in ref.@xcite .    in eq.([eq",

    "for electroweak processes , such as muon decay , in which the external fermions can be considered massless , only the self - energy diagrams of vector bosons need to be considered .",
    "general techniques are available to reduce the tensor integrals that occur to standard form factors @xcite for which scalar integral representations are known . for the present case of zero external momentum , @xmath39 , the vector boson self - energies , @xmath40 , can only take the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a function of the internal masses only and may be obtained from the tensor integral representation of @xmath43 by means of the projection operator , @xmath44 . thus @xmath45 the resulting scalar integral can always written in terms the master integral , @xmath46 , of eq.([eq : masterintexpr ] ) and results obtained that are exact for all @xmath27 .",
    "again for processes with massless external fermions the only relevant vertex corrections are those involving vector bosons and these will necessarily be purely vector and axial - vector in character . a general vertex correction can then be represented as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are functions only of the internal masses .",
    "the tensor integral representation of @xmath50 can easily be obtained by standard techniques and from it the scalar integral representations of @xmath48 and @xmath49 follow by means of projection operators .",
