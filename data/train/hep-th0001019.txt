    "calculations of the casimir energy for spherically symmetric boundary conditions have been the issue of numerous papers , since the first calculation by boyer @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although a general theory describing the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field at finite temperature has been present for a long time @xcite , the extension of the results for the dielectric ball from zero temperature to finite temperatures received less attention .",
    "the case of a conducting spherical boundary ( at zero and finite temperature ) was studied by balian and duplantier @xcite , and will serve here to verify the validity of the results we obtain .",
    "brevik and clausen @xcite , used the debye asymptotic expansion to calculate the casimir force on the dilute dielectric ball , assuming uniform velocity of light inside and outside the ball ( including , however , frequency dependence of the permeability and permittivity ) , to leading order in the so  called dilute approximation ( the nature of this approximation is explained following eq . ) . it turns out that the usual debye approximation is most useful for zero temperature calculations , but involves complications at finite temperatures . for example , it was shown @xcite that use of these asymptotics may lead to problematic results , such as that the casimir energy of a dielectric ball is independent of temperature .    in this letter",
    "we calculate the thermodynamic features of the casimir effect for the dilute dielectric ball at finite temperature ( to leading order in the dilute approximation ) .",
    "we obtain explicit simple expressions for the casimir energy , free energy and for the casimir force at arbitrary temperature . in particular",
    ", we find that ( within the approximation made ) the casimir force is repulsive for any radius at any temperature ( see eq . ) . at high temperature its leading behavior is proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the radius of the ball .",
    "higher order corrections to the dilute approximation decay like powers of @xmath4 , and consequently the leading behavior @xmath2 gives the casimir force quite accurately at high temperature ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the starting point of the present calculation is an explicit expression for the casimir energy density ( to leading order in the dilute approximation ) .",
    "this expression was derived in @xcite using simple properties of the green s function of the helmholtz equation . the casimir energy at finite temperature , @xmath5 , is then obtained by summing that explicit expression for the energy over the matsubara frequencies .",
    "then , using the usual thermodynamic relation between the casimir free energy @xmath6 and the casimir energy @xmath5 , we obtain an explicit expression for @xmath6 valid for all temperatures .",
    "we verify that @xmath5 and @xmath6 coincide at @xmath7 , as they should ( and the casimir entropy vanishes at @xmath7 ) .",
    "furthermore , at high temperatures , @xmath6 tends to a term which is proportional to @xmath8 ( where @xmath3 is the radius of the ball ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the results of @xcite and is also consistent with the recent general discussion of the high  temperature classical limit in @xcite .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of the electromagnetic field , subjected to some boundary conditions , are solutions of a set of characteristic equations @xmath9 labeled by an index @xmath10 .",
    "( the eigenfrequency spectrum is the union of solutions to all the equations in . )",
    "the set of parameters @xmath11 describes the constraints , such as the radius of the sphere or the distance between the conducting plates .",
    "the functions @xmath12 are usually expressions involving solutions of the scalar helmholtz equation subjected to appropriate boundary conditions . in the following",
    "we consider the case of spherical symmetry , where the functions @xmath12 involve combinations of bessel functions ( see eq .",
    "( [ fldef]-[elh ] ) in sec .",
    "3 ) .    let us first consider the system in its ground state at zero temperature .",
    "the zero temperature casimir energy is of course the difference between the formally divergent sum over all allowed modes of the constrained system and the divergent sum over the modes of the free electromagnetic field , @xmath13 this expression is still divergent and needs regularization .",
    "thus , we introduce a uv  frequency cut - off @xmath14 and define @xmath15 when the boundaries are pushed to infinity , the system ceases to be constrained and becomes free .",
    "this is described by letting the parameters * c * in tend to an appropriate value , say , infinity .",
    "it is convenient to represent the sum in the last expression as a contour integral @xmath16 where @xmath17 is shown on fig.[f1 ] , and    @xmath18    is the ( regulated ) resolvent corresponding to index @xmath10 in , and ",
    "@xmath19 \" denotes the set of parameters describing the limiting case where the boundaries are taken to infinity . in the case of spherical geometry",
    "this is achieved by taking the radius to infinity .",
    "the casimir energy is then defined as @xmath20 to carry over these considerations to finite temperature , we recall that the average energy per mode of the electromagnetic field is @xmath21 and that the free energy per mode is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "thus , @xmath24 is the ( cut off ) casimir energy at temperature @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the ( cut off ) casimir free energy at temperature @xmath25 . upon rotating the integration contour in to wrap around the imaginary axis",
    ", the casimir energy can be expressed as a sum over matsubara modes , namely @xmath27 this concludes our general considerations .",
    "in this section we study the temperature dependence of the casimir energy of a dielectric ball , having permittivity and permeability @xmath28 which is embedded in a medium with permittivity and permeability @xmath29 . a further simplifying assumption which we make throughout this letter ,",
    "is that the velocity of light be continuous across the boundary , namely @xmath30 this condition is often desirable as it causes the frequency equations to simplify and some divergences to cancel out ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it turns out that in this case the energy depends on the dielectric data only through the parameter @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 which is symmetric under @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the casimir energy is invariant under interchanging the inner and outer media .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that under the condition , and after rotating the integration contour in to the imaginary axis , that the difference in zero point energy of two balls of radii @xmath3 and @xmath34 may be written as @xmath35 where the resolvent is @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the modified bessel functions ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 @xmath40 the case of @xmath41 finite but small corresponds to the inner ball being nearly identical in its properties to the surrounding medium .",
    "this is referred to in the literature as the limit of dilute media . in this limit",
    "we can expand in powers of @xmath31 .",
    "this expansion is further justified by the fact that on the imaginary @xmath42 axis @xmath43 is small , thus the expansion can be pushed to @xmath44 ( for @xmath45 , of course , one of the media has infinite conductivity and is thus a perfect conductor ) . in this letter",
    "we will content ourselves with the leading term in this expansion .",
    "thus , to order @xmath31 we have from @xmath46 in to first order in @xmath31 in closed form , without using debye approximations , as is usually done in the literature .",
    "the result was @xmath47 thus , the relative resolvent , to order @xmath31 , is @xmath48\\label{relativedensity}\\ ] ] ( here @xmath49 is a pure imaginary frequency . )    using this simple explicit expression , we can calculate the energy in the dilute limit at an arbitrary temperature . in order to calculate the zero point energy with respect to the vacuum we take the limit @xmath50 at the outset .",
    "note that the @xmath51 independent term in cancels between the two terms in the difference , resulting in an expression which decays exponentially when @xmath52 .",
    "thus , no further regularization will be needed when we integrate over @xmath42 . using and , the casimir energy at temperature @xmath25 is @xmath53 yielding @xmath54 this result is exact ( to order @xmath31 ) for all temperatures .",
    "it is immediate to check that as @xmath25 goes to zero we retain the correct zero temperature result @xcite @xmath55 note that at high temperatures , @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 which is consistent with eq.(8.39 ) in @xcite for the free energy , to leading order .",
    "namely , the casimir energy at high temperatures is independent of the radius of the ball . that @xmath58 becomes independent of the radius at high temperature",
    "is expected on general grounds ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) : at high enough temperatures we expect classical equipartition to hold .",
    "since there is obviously a one to one correspondence between the states of the system with radius @xmath3 and the states of any other system with a different radius @xmath34 , the difference between the zero point energies of these two systems must vanish at high temperatures .",
    "indeed , for the case studied here , the difference ( to order @xmath31 ) vanishes exponentially fast with temperature .",
    "having calculated the energy we may now use the expression to infer the casimir free energy of the system . from the general relation @xmath59 we have @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is an integration constant to be determined ) , or , equivalently , @xmath62 to evaluate the casimir free enrgy at low temperatures we first expand @xmath5 around @xmath7 @xmath63 ( note that the first temperature dependent contribution to the energy is of order @xmath64 . ) thus , from , the casimir free energy is @xmath65 to fix the constant @xmath61 , we use the third law of thermodynamics , namely , that the casimir entropy @xmath66 vanishes at @xmath7 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that this implies @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , at low temperatures , the casimir free energy is : @xmath68 this result coincides with the two scattering approximation @xcite for the conducting sphere ( up to multiplication by @xmath31 ) .    to proceed beyond low temperatures we rewrite as @xmath69 one can easily check , using the power series , that the integral on the right side converges , and that indeed @xmath70 satisfies the condition . to show that there is no additional term of the form @xmath71 in",
    ", we note that this expression can also be verified for any particular mode @xmath42 of the electromagnetic field .",
    "writing , @xmath72 and then summing over the modes gives precisely .    in order to evaluate it",
    "is convenient to split @xmath73 into @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 and then split the integral in accordingly .",
    "the contribution associated with @xmath77 can be integrated in a straightforward manner , whereas the contribution from @xmath78 requires more careful treatment .",
    "thus , @xmath79 the term associated with @xmath77 is now straightforwardly integrated to yield @xmath80 .",
    "\\label{e1t}\\ ] ] we are now left with the second term , which can be written as @xmath81 the last integral is , of course ,",
    "well defined at @xmath7 , but diverges logarithmically as @xmath82 . to simplify this expression",
    "we observe that @xmath83 ( eq .",
    "8.341.1 in @xcite ) , where @xmath84 can be thought of as a uv  regulator , which is set to zero in the end ( it is understood that @xmath85 throughout the calculations . ) .",
    "thus , writing @xmath86 and using the expansions @xmath87 ( 6.1.33 in @xcite , @xmath88 is euler s constant ) and @xmath89 ( eq .",
    "8.214.1 in @xcite ) , we find after taking the limit @xmath90 , that @xmath91 in which the last integral is well defined for all @xmath25 .",
    "combining this result with , we obtain from the following expression for the casimir free energy at arbitrary temperature : @xmath92+\\\\ \\nonumber & { t\\xi^2\\over 2}\\int_{8 a \\pi t}^{\\infty}{dt\\over ( e^t-1)t}+ { \\frac{a\\,\\pi \\,{t^2}\\,\\xi ^2 }     { { { \\left({e^{8\\,a\\,\\pi \\,t } } -1   \\right ) } ^2}}}+ {      \\frac{\\left ( 5\\,t\\,\\xi ^2 + 8\\,a\\,\\pi \\,{t^2}\\,\\xi ^2         \\right ) } { 8\\,\\left({e^{8\\,a\\,\\pi \\,t}}-1 \\right ) } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath93 , and thus , the linear and @xmath94 terms in agree with the two - scattering approximation @xcite ( when @xmath95 ) .",
    "all other terms in decay exponentially as @xmath82 and not as powers as is seen in eq",
    ". 8.39 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the density of states in the @xmath31 approximation decays exponentially with frequency and not as @xmath96 , which was the basis of the high temperature approximation used in @xcite ( see eq . ( 6.12 ) therein ) .",
    "this suggests that at sufficiently high temperatures , we will have to include higher order corrections in @xmath31 to see the power law decay .",
    "however , as we shall see in the next section , there are no further corrections to the @xmath25 and @xmath94 terms which depend on the radius @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the @xmath31 approximation gives a reliable estimate of the casimir force at high temperatures .",
    "another interesting feature of the last expression is that @xmath97 for @xmath3 large , while @xmath98 for small values of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , for any temperature @xmath25 there is an intermediate radius @xmath99 such that @xmath100 for this radius ( it follows that the free energy may be also viewed as relative to the energy of the ball with this zero - energy radius . )    from we calculate the casimir force to order @xmath31 @xmath101 we see that the force is positive for all values of @xmath3 and @xmath25 .",
    "moreover it behaves as @xmath102 at high temperatures .",
    "another quantity of interest , which is the casimir entropy , behaves as @xmath103 at high temperatures .",
    "in this section we use a different approach based on evaluating directly .",
    "this analysis was carried out for high and low temperatures in the case of the conducting sphere by balian and duplantier @xcite . to make our discussion",
    "well defined we consider the difference in free energy between two balls of radii @xmath3 and @xmath34 . from",
    "we deduce that the relative casimir free energy is @xmath104 it is convenient to decompose the logarithm as @xmath105 ( where , as usual , @xmath106 means that the @xmath107 term is counted with half - weight ) .",
    "note that @xmath108 is an odd function of frequencies .",
    "thus , discarding the even part of , we are left with @xmath109 the first term on the right side is a decaying function of temperature ( it decays as @xmath4 ) .",
    "the linear and logarithmic contributions in @xmath25 come only from the second term .",
    "we now expand in powers of @xmath31 , and work to leading order in @xmath31 . substituting @xmath110 from into",
    ", we can show that the leading term in is consistent with the expression we obtained in the previous section .",
    "( in the following we integrate without using the @xmath34 dependent terms , wherever they are not necessary for convergence . )",
    "we start with the easily integrable expressions : @xmath111 note that we summed starting with @xmath112 , since the @xmath107 term is independent of the radius and thus cancels out ( when taking the difference ) .",
    "the less trivial terms can be calculated as follows @xmath113    thus the difference between the free energy of two balls is : @xmath114 \\label{freeball}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 clearly and are consistent .",
    "finally , we make the important observation that terms of order @xmath116 and higher in the expansion of do not contribute to @xmath117 terms that are proportional to @xmath25 or @xmath94 with coefficients that depend on @xmath3 .",
    "to see this , note from and from that contribution to terms proportional to @xmath25 or @xmath94 will come from expression such as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } & \\frac{\\pi}{\\beta } \\sum_{l=1}^{\\infty } ( l+{1\\over 2})\\int_{0}^{\\infty } f^{(2m)}_{l}(\\omega;a , b)d\\omega=\\\\ \\nonumber & \\frac{\\pi}{\\beta } \\sum_{l=1}^{\\infty } ( l+{1\\over 2})\\int_{0}^{\\infty } { \\xi^{2m}\\over 2\\pi m}{d\\over d\\omega}\\biggr(\\lambda_{l}^{2m}(a |\\omega|)-\\lambda_{l}^{2m}(b    first sum in , obviously decay as powers in @xmath4 . ) for any @xmath119 each term in the last sum can be integrated to yield : @xmath120 since for all @xmath119 this sum is convergent at @xmath121 ( note that @xmath122 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath25 and @xmath123 terms which depend on @xmath3 in the _ exact _ @xmath117 are accurately accounted for by the order @xmath31 expression .",
    "consequently , gives the casimir force quite accurately at high @xmath25 , up to corrections in @xmath4 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the casimir energy , free energy and force were studied in the dilute dielectric ball approximation .",
    "we showed that the free energy , and thus the force , can be obtained from the casimir energy , which is an easier quantity to calculate .",
    "this was done for an arbitrary temperature , and agrees with the two - scattering results for a conducting shell obtained in @xcite for the high and low temperature limits .",
    "we confirmed that in the high temperature limit the free energy behaves as @xmath8 , while the casimir energy is linear in @xmath25 .",
    "however this linear term is independent of geometry , and thus , the energy difference between two balls of different radii decays exponentially .",
    "this is expected from the equipartition property of classical statistical mechanics - at high temperatures the average energy per mode , @xmath124 , is independent of the frequency , and since there is a one to one correspondence between the eigenmodes of two spheres of different radii , the difference in the energy should vanish in the high temperature limit .",
    "the calculations were based on the method developed in @xcite .",
    "this method have since been used in other related problems at zero temperature in @xcite .",
    "we expect that these cases now too admit an exact treatment , along similar lines as presented here .",
