    "ngc 1068 is the archetypical nearby active galaxy ( cf .",
    "antonucci , miller 1985 ) while ngc 4258 belongs to a class of low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liner ; heckman 1980 ) .",
    "the recent very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) measurements of h@xmath1o maser emission of these two galaxies have shown that high - density molecular gas clouds are orbiting around their central , massive object ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; greenhill et al .  1995 , 1996 ;",
    "gallimore et al .",
    "although both the galaxies have a hidden active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ( antonucci , miller 1985 ; wilkes et al .",
    "1995 ) , their observational properties are quite different . in table 1 , we compare the observational properties of the central engines and the molecular gas tori in ngc 1068 and ngc 4258 .",
    "the comparisons of hard x - ray , radio continuum , and h@xmath2 luminosities between them show that ngc 1068 is brighter intrinsically by two orders of magnitude than ngc 4258 . in spite of this significant difference in luminosity of the central engines , the estimated nuclear mass of ngc 1068o maser emission by greenhill et al .",
    "( 1996 ) gives the observed rotational velocity , @xmath3 km s@xmath4 , at the inner radius of the sub - keplerian ring , @xmath5 pc .",
    "adopting an angle between the rotational axis of the torus and the line of sight , @xmath6 ( young et al .",
    "1996 ) , we obtain the nuclear mass , @xmath7 at distance 22 mpc . ]",
    "( @xmath8 ) is almost comparable to that of ngc 4258 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is usually considered that agns are powered by an accreting , supermassive black hole ( lynden - bell 1969 ; rees 1984 ) . in this model ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity of central engines depends solely on the mass accretion rate and thus there is no dependency on the central black hole mass .",
    "therefore , the above observations suggest that the mass accretion rate in ngc 1068 is much higher than that in ngc 4258 . in order to understand what happens in both the nuclei",
    ", we compare the dynamical properties of the masing molecular tori between the two galaxies and show possible evidence for dynamical accretion of molecular gas in ngc 1068 .",
    "in order to consider a possible mechanism which explains why ngc 1068 has a more powerful agn than ngc 4258 , we compare the observational properties of the h@xmath1o masing clouds between ngc 1068 and ngc 4258 . in figure 1 , we show the schematic illustration of the observed h@xmath1o maser emission of ngc 1068 ( greenhill et al .  1996 ) and ngc 4258 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; greenhill et al .",
    "first , we summarize the observational properties of the molecular torus in ngc 4258 .",
    "the h@xmath1o maser emission consists of the two components ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; greenhill et al .",
    "1995 ) : 1 ) one is the main component whose observed velocity corresponds to the systemic one .",
    "this emission arises near the inner edge of the torus along the line of sight .",
    "this component is due to background amplified - beamed emission . and ,",
    "2 ) the other is the high - velocity components which come from the two tangential sections of the molecular torus .",
    "since there is no background continuum source for these components , it is considered that they are due to self amplification along the long gain paths .",
    "the typical line width of each maser emission line ,",
    "@xmath10 km s@xmath4 , gives a path length of @xmath11 0.01 pc ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) . in summary ,",
    "the masing emission of ngc 4258 comes from these two portions of the molecular torus .",
    "it should be mentioned that the masing emission is _ not _ observed from the shaded area shown in figure 1 because of either the short path length or no background continuum source ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; greenhill et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "next we discuss the h@xmath1o maser emission of ngc1068 .",
    "we should mention that the kinematical property of the maser emission of ngc 1068 is significantly different from that of ngc 4258 . in ngc 4258",
    ", the high - velocity components are seen only in the portions of keplerian ring where the path length is long enough to achieve self - amplification ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; greenhill et al .",
    "1995 ) . on the other hand , in the case of ngc 1068",
    ", there appear many masing clouds in the `` _ unseen _ '' area in which self amplification can not be achieved ; e.g. , the component no .  4 and the majority of component no .  3 identified by greenhill et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in order to elucidate difference in kinematical property of the masing clouds between ngc 1068 and ngc 4258",
    ", we estimate quantitatively the unseen area of masing tori in both galaxies . since a long path length ( @xmath12 0.01 pc ; miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) is necessary to cause the self - amplified masing in a molecular torus with the ( sub- ) keplerian rotation , most parts of the molecular ring become to be the unseen area ( miyoshi et al .  1995 ; greenhill et al .  1995 ) .",
    "we consider a molecular torus with a radial velocity distribution of @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the circular velocity at radius @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the circular velocity at the inner edge of the torus ( @xmath17 ) [ see figure 1 ] .",
    "the power index , @xmath18 , is @xmath19 for the keplerian torus ( i.e. , for ngc 4258 ) while @xmath20 for ngc 1068 ( greenhill et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the velocity gradient along the line of sight is given by the derivative ,      where @xmath22 is the line of sight velocity at radius @xmath15 and @xmath23 .",
    "the definition of @xmath24 is shown in figure 1 . in the unseen area ,",
    "the velocity change ( @xmath25 ) within a path length ( @xmath26 ) should be larger than 1 km s@xmath4 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) ; i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "this condition gives a constraint on the unseen angle , @xmath24 ,      in the lower panel of figure 1 , we show the unseen area for both ngc 4258 and ngc 1068 . here",
    "we adopt @xmath29 = ( 1080 km s@xmath4 , 0.13 pc ) for ngc 4258 and @xmath29 = ( 300 km s@xmath4 , 0.56 pc ) for ngc 1068 . in the case of ngc 4258 , it is shown that the high velocity component can arise from the tangential sections of the torus , being consistent with the observations ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; greenhill et al .",
    "1995 ) . as for the main component ,",
    "if we assume the point - like continuum radiation source , we need an opening angle of 7@xmath30 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "since , however , this angle is larger than the critical unseen angle ( 0@xmath30.5 ) , we consider that the continuum source may have a spatial extent of @xmath11 0.01 pc ( cf .",
    "haschick , baan 1994 ) .",
    "although the unseen area estimated for the case of ngc 1068 is basically similar to that of ngc 4258 , the observed appearance of the masing clouds in ngc 1068 is significantly different from that of ngc 4258 .",
    "therefore , we must consider some other different masing mechanisms for the masing clouds of ngc 1068 which appear in the unseen area .",
    "greenhill et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed that the maser emission comes from the limb of the torus rather than the midplane . though they argued that the orbital motion is parallel to the line of sight along the limb and produces a substantial amplification",
    "however , since the limb may co - rotate with the midplane ( i.e. , the sub - keplerian rotation ) , it is unlikely that only the gas clouds on the limb can gain the long path .",
    "therefore , the masing regions can not be attributed to the sub - keplerian rotating molecular torus .",
    "it is thus suggested that they come from dense molecular clouds inside the torus . in order for such clouds to gain the long path length ,",
    "the velocity structure should obey a rigid - body rotation .",
    "there are two alternatives for such a cloud system .",
    "one is a gaseous bar ( or an oval ring ) with a figure rotation .",
    "since the sub - keplerian torus suggests the presence of gravitational disturbance to this torus , it is likely that there is the inner non - axisymmetric potential like a bar structure .",
    "the other possibility is that clumpy molecular clouds rotate like a rigid body as a whole",
    ". a typical size of each cloud would be as large as @xmath11 0.01 pc to gain the long path length enough to cause the masing .",
    "however , each cloud itself may rotate because of the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "thus if this is the case , each cloud would rotate as a rigid body rotator again .    here a key question",
    "arise as how to make such a gaseous bar or a clumpy cloud system inside the torus .",
    "the gradual accumulation of gas clouds toward the central region of the galaxy causes over density in the gas cloud system .",
    "once the gas mass exceeds about one tenth of the dynamical mass within the concerned region , the gas may experience the gravitational instability because of its self gravity , leading to the formation of either a bar ( shlosman et al .",
    "1989 ; shlosman et al .",
    "1990 ; wada , habe 1995 ) or clumpy gas clouds ( shlosman , noguchi 1993 ; heller , shlosman 1994 ) .",
    "if the gas mass within @xmath31 0.56 pc would exceed @xmath32 , the gravitational instability may occur in the nuclear gas of ngc 1068 .",
    "although , however , ngc 1068 has abundant dense gas in the nuclear region ( tacconi et al .",
    "1994 ) , the gas mass associated with the dusty torus is estimated to be @xmath33 at most ( pier , krolik 1992b , 1993 ) .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the rigid - body component comes from the gravitational instability of the torus itself . taking the more powerful central engine of ngc 1068 into account",
    ", we may consider that the inner radius of the torus in ngc 1068 would be once much smaller .",
    "if this is the case , we expect that the inner parts of the molecular torus may be broken by the intense radiation field ( cf",
    ".  pier , krolik 1992a ; see also neufeld , maloney 1995 ) .",
    "although we can not specify the actual geometry of the rigid - body component , we show our modest interpretation schematically in figure 2 .",
    "finally we estimate a possible gas accretion rate from the inner torus broken by the intense radiation in ngc 1068 . since it is considered that the gas clouds broken by the radiation may accrete in a characteristic time which is roughly comparable to the free fall time there , @xmath34 years for @xmath35 pc . since",
    ", however , we do not take the angular momentum loss into account in this estimate , this timescale should be considered as a lower limit . the gas mass broken by the radiation may be the same order as that of the present torus , @xmath36 , giving a nominal _ dynamical _ accretion rate as @xmath37 y@xmath4 .",
    "though it is hard to estimate the effect of angular momentum loss accurately because of ambiguity in the physical and dynamical condition of the nuclear gas , we may estimate the probable accretion timescale from the actual size of the narrow line region ( nlr ) in ngc 1068 . given the size of the nlr , @xmath38 900 pc at the distance @xmath39 = 22 mpc ( schmitt , kinney 1996 ) , the timescale ( i.e. , the lifetime of the central engine ) is estimated to be @xmath40 years where @xmath41 is the net velocity of the ionizing radiation ( @xmath42 is the light velocity in the vacuum ) . here",
    "we assume @xmath43 because it is unlikely that the ionizing radiation is highly relativistic ( cf .",
    "gallimore et al .",
    "since this timescale is more reliable than that estimated above , we obtain the most probable dynamical accretion rate , @xmath44 y@xmath4 .",
    "next , we estimate another accretion rate based on the bolometric luminosity .",
    "pier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) gave the bolometric luminosity of the central engine in ngc 1068 , @xmath45 erg s@xmath4 where @xmath46 is the fraction of nuclear flux reflected into our line of sight and @xmath39 is the distance to ngc 1068 .",
    "adopting the fiducial values in pier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we obtain the gas accretion rate based on the luminosity , @xmath47 y@xmath4 where @xmath48 is the conversion efficiency from the gravitational energy to the radiation . since this value is almost consistent with the dynamical one , we consider that the dynamical accretion may be responsible for the activity in ngc 1068 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the striking difference of the molecular gas tori between ngc 1068 and ngc 4258 is the presence / absence of a rigid - body rotating component which may be formed through the destruction of the innermost torus by the strong radiation from the central engine .",
    "this component may provide direct evidence for dynamical accretion of the nuclear gas in ngc 1068 . since this component is not observed in the less - luminous agn of ngc 4258",
    ", we suggest that this component is responsible for the more powerful agn in ngc 1068 .",
