    "<S> long - duration ( @xmath0 s ) @xmath1-ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to originate from collapsars that involve death of massive stars and are expected to be accompanied by luminous supernovae ( sne ) . </S>",
    "<S> grb 060614 was a nearby burst with a duration of 102 s at a redshift of 0.125 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while it is classified as a long burst according to its duration , extensive searches did not find any sne - like emission down to limits hundreds of times fainter than sn 1998bw @xcite , the archetypal hypernova that accompanied long grbs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the temporal lag and peak luminosity of grb 060614 fell entirely within the short duration subclass and the properties of the host galaxy distinguish it from other long - duration grb hosts . </S>",
    "<S> thus , grb 060614 did not fit into the standard picture in which long duration grbs arise from the collapse of massive stars while short ones arise from compact binary mergers . </S>",
    "<S> it was nicknamed the  long - short burst \" as its origin was unclear . </S>",
    "<S> some speculated that it originated from compact binary merger and thus it is intrinsically a  short \" grb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> others proposed that it was formed in a new type of a collapsar which produces an energetic @xmath3ray burst that is not accompanied by an sne @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> two recent developments may shed a new light on the origin of this object . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the detection of a few very weak sne ( e.g. sn 2008 ha @xcite ) with peak bolometric luminosities as low as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the second is the detection of an infrared bump , again with a @xmath4 , in the late afterglow of the short burst grb 130603b @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was interpreted as a li - paczyski macronova ( also called kilonova ) @xcite @xmath2a near - infrared / optical transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in the ejecta of a compact binary merger . </S>",

    "<S> we focus on the optical emission . </S>",
    "<S> we have re - analyzed all the late time ( i.e. , @xmath9 day ) very large telescope ( vlt ) @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12band archival data and the hst f606w and f814w archival data , including those reported in the literature @xcite and several unpublished data points . </S>",

    "<S> however , the first hst f814w data point is significantly above the same extrapolated power - law decline . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the deviation is @xmath16 ( see the estimate in the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> no statistically - significant excess is present in both the f606w and the @xmath11 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the f814w - band excess is made most forcibly by considering the color evolution of the transient , defined as the difference between the magnitudes in each filter , which evolves from @xmath17 mag by the vlt ( correspondingly for hst we have @xmath18 mag ) at about @xmath19 day to @xmath20 mag by hst at about @xmath21 day after the trigger of the burst . with proper / minor extinction corrections , the optical to x - ray spectrum energy distribution for grb 060614 at the epoch of @xmath22 day </S>",
    "<S> is nicely fitted by a single power - law @xmath23 @xcite . in the standard external forward shock afterglow model , the cooling frequency </S>",
    "<S> is expected to drop with time as @xmath24 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it can not change the optical spectrum in the time interval of @xmath25 day . </S>",

    "<S> we turn now to explore whether the f814w - band excess can be powered by a weak supernova . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig:2 ] depicts the color f606w@xmath2f814w of the excess component ( we take f606w@xmath2f814w@xmath31 mag as a conservative lower limit of the color of the  excess \" component due to the lack of simultaneous excess in f606w - band ) with that of sn 2006aj @xcite , sn 2010bh @xcite and sn 2008 ha , an extremely dim event @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> note that the  excess component \" is much redder than them.,width=529 ]    the low luminosity as well as the low effective temperature of the transient emission are typical characteristics of a macronova , a transient arising from the radioactive @xmath41-decay of material ejected in a compact binary merger . </S>",
    "<S> the opacity of the macronova material is determined by the lanthanides that are produced via @xmath42process in the neutron - rich outflow . </S>",
    "<S> this opacity is very large ( @xmath43 ) resulting in a weak , late and red emission . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging flux is greatly diminished by line blanketing , with the radiation peaking in the near - infrared and being produced over a timescale of @xmath44 weeks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simple analytic estimates , using a radioactive @xmath41-decay heating rate of @xmath45^{-1.3}$ ] @xcite , suggest that in order to explain the observed f814w - band excess , the required ejecta mass and expansion velocity are : @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that the macronova outflow is quite cold at such a late time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature is @xmath48 k and the observer s f814w - band is above the peak of the black body spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the emitting radius and the corresponding expansion velocity are much larger than in a supernova at this stage . scaled up numerical simulations of lighter ejecta from black hole@xmath2neutron star mergers </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggest that @xmath49 and a velocity @xmath50 can account for the observed f814w - band excess . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical example is presented in fig.[fig:1 ] in dashed lines .    </S>",
    "<S> the implied ejecta mass is large compared with the mass ejection estimated numerically to take place in double neutron star mergers . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is within the possible range of dynamical ejecta of black hole - neutron star mergers with some extreme parameters ( a large neutron star radius and a high black - hole spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an accretion disk wind may contribute some additional mass as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the radioactive heating due to fission of the heavy @xmath42process nuclei , which is quite uncertain and subdominant in current heating estimates @xcite , may play an important role in the energy deposition . </S>",
    "<S> it may increase the energy deposition rate at around ten days by a significant factor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may reduces the required ejecta mass to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this range of the ejecta masses is well within the range of the dynamical ejecta of black - hole neutron star mergers and it is even compatible with some estimates of double neutron star mergers .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that while a weak supernova can not explain the observations , a high mass ejection macronova may . </S>",
    "<S> like in grb 130603b we must caution here that this interpretation is based on a single data point . </S>",
    "<S> however , if this interpretation is correct , it has far reaching implications . </S>",
    "<S> first , the presence of macronovae in both the canonical short burst grb 130603b and in this  long - short \" one , grb 060614 , suggests that the phenomenon is common and the prospects of detecting these transients are promising . </S>",
    "<S> a more conclusive detection based on more than a single data point could be achieved in the future provided that denser hst observations are carried out . moreover , as a black hole  </S>",
    "<S> neutron star merger is favored in explaining the large ejected mass this implies that such binary systems may exist and their mergers are also responsible for grbs . </S>",
    "<S> it also suggests that the  long - short \" burst was in fact  short \" in nature , namely , it arose from a merger and not from a collapsar . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that a merger generates a 100 sec long burst is interesting and puzzling by itself .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly such events would contribute a significant fraction of the @xmath42process material[lattimer1974 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the actual contribution relative to the contribution of 130603b - like events is difficult to estimate as it is unclear which fraction of the macronovae / kilonovae behave as each type . because of beaming most mergers will not be observed as grbs </S>",
    "<S> however , they emit omnidirectional gravitational radiation that can be detected by the upcoming advanced ligo / virgo / kagra detectors . </S>",
    "<S> these near - infrared / optical macronovae could serve as promising electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave triggers in the upcoming advanced ligo / virgo / kagra era . </S>",
