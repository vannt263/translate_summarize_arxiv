    "the spectral scale was introduced by the present authors and nik weaver in @xcite and further developed by the authors in @xcite .",
    "it is defined for any finite set of self - adjoint operators in a finite von neumann algebra .",
    "the main theme in @xcite and @xcite is that full spectral information about real linear combinations of such operators is contained in the spectral scale and that much of this information is reflected by the geometry of the spectral scale .    in the present paper",
    "we view the spectral scale from another perspective and thereby show that full information about the @xmath10numerical range of a finite dimensional operator is also contained in its spectral scale .",
    "thus , in this restricted case at least , two rather different sets of data are combined into one three dimensional , compact , convex set .",
    "although we restrict consideration in this paper to the finite dimensional world , we shall write this paper using the language of operators ( rather than matrices ) to emphasize how easily many of the concepts generalize to infinite dimensional situations .    the notation developed here will be used throughout the rest of the paper .",

    "the definition of @xmath21 then becomes @xmath25 and we now define the spectral scale @xmath26 of @xmath0 by the formula @xmath27 thus , we now view @xmath7 as a subset of @xmath28 , rather than as a subset of @xmath29 .",

    "information of this sort is widely valued as documented in @xcite the basis for this current work is the observation that @xmath7 also essentially contains the @xmath10-numerical range of @xmath0 for each @xmath34 .    since we shall show that several of the currently known properties of the numerical range generalize to the @xmath10numerical range ,",

    "it is shown that several of the known facts about corners on the boundary of @xmath37 generalize to @xmath9 by using the additional structure provided by the spectral scale .",
    "for example , in theorem 3.4 , we show that a singularity on the boundary of @xmath9 always occurs at an isolated extreme point of @xmath9 and such points correspond to central projections in the algebra @xmath17 , i.e. reducing subspaces for @xmath0 .",
    "we also show that @xmath0 is normal if and only if @xmath9 is a polygon for @xmath115 ( theorem 3.5 ) .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are devoted to establishing that the boundary of the @xmath10-numerical range is the finite union of line segments and curved real analytic arcs ( theorem 5.4 ) . in section 4",
    "we review some classical background which is required for our analysis and then use this to derive our results in section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains some open question , stated as conjectures .",
    "as our results show , the spectral scale provides a new way to study @xmath1-tuples of self - adjoint finite dimensional operators . in the case under study here , when there are just two operators so that @xmath7 is a subset of three dimensional real euclidean space ( or @xmath116 ) , we may actually visualize @xmath7 as shown in the examples and pictures in section 2 .",
    "these pictures were created using a matlb program written by jeff duzak as part of an reu research project supervised by the second author .",
    "readers can contact the second author for a copy of this program which is quite useful for testing conjectures .",
    "the spectral scale has a striking structure in the finite dimensional case under consideration here which we describe in the next proposition .",
    "if @xmath49 is an extreme point of @xmath7 , then it lies in an isotrace slice of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",

    "for example , if @xmath123 , then extreme points of @xmath7 come from projections of trace @xmath62 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 or @xmath19 . while @xmath126 and @xmath127 are always the single points @xmath62 and @xmath128 , in generic examples @xmath129 and @xmath130 are solid ellipses whose boundaries consist of extreme points of @xmath7 .",
    "hence , generically , the boundary of @xmath7 between two successive isotrace slices consists of one dimensional faces .",
    "the boundary between @xmath126 and @xmath129 is typically a skewed cone , and , by the symmetry of @xmath7 , the same is true for the boundary of @xmath7 between @xmath130 and @xmath127 .",

    "if @xmath442 is an eigenvalue for @xmath431 , then we have @xmath443 and so using the relation @xmath444 above , we get that if @xmath445 , then @xmath446 hence , applying theorem 4.5 , we get @xmath447 for some pair @xmath448 .",

    "we use the notation introduced in theorem 4.3 .",
    "let @xmath473 denote an open interval in @xmath474 whose end points are adjacent points in @xmath453 .",
    "we have then that the functions @xmath459 are real analytic and completely distinct on @xmath473 by part @xmath100 of theorem 5.3 .",
    "hence , we may re - index these functions as @xmath475 for @xmath476 and assume that @xmath477 for each @xmath478 . similarly , with additional re - indexing , we may assume that for each fixed @xmath140 the eigenvalue @xmath479 has multiplicity @xmath466 .",
    "hence , we may find positive integers @xmath480 and @xmath481 such that @xmath482 and @xmath483 with this we get that @xmath427 , which is the sum of the @xmath10 largest eigenvalues of @xmath431 by theorem 5.2 , is precisely @xmath484 and so the map @xmath485 is real analytic on @xmath473 by theorem 4.3 .",
    "since the set @xmath453 is finite , this argument shows that @xmath427 is differentiable on @xmath454 , with the possible exception of a finite subset of @xmath486 .",
    "hence , the boundary of @xmath9 contains a finite number of line segments by lemma 5.1 and the remaining boundary points are contained in a finite number of curved real analytic arcs .",
    "the spectral scale @xmath487 has a finite number of faces of dimension two .",

    "as noted at the beginning of this section , agler , kippenhahn and narcowich each base their analyses on the fact that the tangent line @xmath402 for @xmath37 is determined by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath431 .",
    "kippenhahn then continues his analysis in the setting of algebraic geometry . on the other hand",
    ", agler uses the theory of several complex variables in his analysis , while narcowich bases his proof on a theorem of nagy .",
    "the argument in agler s paper is quite similar to the one presented here .",
    "for example , both reduce to a consideration of polynomials without repeated factors and then rely on the discriminant to determine the set @xmath486 .",
    "the main difference between the proof above and agler s is that since we are working in finite dimensions , we can base our analysis on the classical results on algebraic analytic functions , rather than delving into the more abstruse world ( from our vantage , at least ) of several complex variables .",
    "our contribution consists of the observation that agler s proof may be extended to cover the case where we are working with sums of eigenvalues .",
    "nagy s theorem ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 376 ) , which is the basis for narcowich s argument may be viewed in this context as an infinite dimensional version of theorem 4.3 .",
    "kippenhahn showed that the boundary of the numerical range lies in the zero set of an algebraic curve as follows .",
    "he considered @xmath488 , which is a homogeneous polynomial and so defines an algebraic curve in complex projective 3-space .",
    "he observed if @xmath404 denotes the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath489 for each fixed @xmath403 , then the formula @xmath490 determines the tangent line @xmath402 described at the beginning of this section .",
    "the envelope of these tangents is also an algebraic curve , which is called the * dual curve * to @xmath60 ( * ? ? ? * and proposition 5 , page 253 ) .",
    "thus , the boundary of the numerical ranges lies in the zero set of this dual curve .",
    "it seems likely that the boundary of the @xmath10-numerical range also lies on an algebraic curve . to show this",
    "using kippenhahn s technique requires showing that if @xmath404 denotes the sum of the @xmath10 largest eigenvalues of @xmath431 , then points of the form @xmath491 also lie on an algebraic curve .",
    "now it is a standard algebraic that fact that since each eigenvalue of @xmath431 lies on a fixed algebraic curve .",
    "this means that for each fixed @xmath403 we may find real numbers @xmath492 and @xmath493 such that point@xmath494 lies on this curve .",
