    "recall that a locally lipschitz metric possesses a locally bounded connection and hence a distributional curvature , which , however , in general is unbounded .",
    "in fact the discontinuity in the derivatives of the metric introduces impulsive components in the weyl and curvature tensors ( see @xcite ) , and the metric ( [ conti ] ) explicitly describes impulsive waves in de  sitter , anti - de  sitter or minkowski backgrounds .    for @xmath23 , reduces to the classic rosen form of impulsive _ pp_-waves ( cf .",

    "traschen class ( @xcite ) of metrics ( of regularity @xmath34 ) , which guarantees existence and stability of the curvature in distributions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to its simple geometrical structure the metric ( [ confppimp ] ) nevertheless allows to calculate the curvature as a distribution , again leading to impulsive components in the weyl and curvature tensors ( @xcite ) .",

    "the key to these results was provided by a nonlinear distributional analysis of the geodesics in the metric , and , in particular , an existence , uniqueness and completeness result for the geodesic equation in nonlinear generalised functions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that a first step towards the long - term goal of understanding the transformation for @xmath4 is to reach a mathematically sound understanding of the geodesics in the distributional metric .",
    "the geodesic equation for , however , displays a very singular behaviour including terms proportional to the square of the dirac-@xmath35 ( cf .",
    "for this reason the authors of @xcite have employed a five - dimensional formalism ( @xcite ) of embedding ( anti-)de  sitter space into a @xmath0-dimensional _ pp_-wave spacetime ( see section [ sec2 ] below ) . in this approach",
    "the geodesic equation takes a form that is distributionally accessible at all , however , not mathematically rigorously . in the absence of a valid solution concept for this nonlinear distributional equations a natural ansatz was used to derive the geodesics and to study them in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , a desirable nonlinear distributional analysis of the geodesic equation in the @xmath36-cases , which will eventually lead to a mathematical understanding of the transformation , has been missing to date .    in this paper",
    "we provide such an analysis .",
    "thereby , we follow @xcite in employing the five - dimensional formalism .",
    "we will , however , not use any theory of nonlinear distributions leaving a detailed study of nonexpanding impulsive waves in ( anti-)de sitter universe as ( nonlinear ) distributional geometries to a subsequent paper .",
    "instead , we will employ a regularisation approach and view as a spacetime with a short but finitely extended impulse ( i.e. , a generic sandwich wave with support in a regularisation strip which we will also call the ` wave zone ' ) and employ an analysis in the spirit of @xcite where impulsive limits in a class of _ pp_-wave type spacetimes with a more general wave surface but vanishing @xmath2 ( @xcite ) have been considered .",
    "we will detail this regularisation approach in the next section after introducing the @xmath0-dimensional formalism.in particular , we will replace the dirac-@xmath35 in the metric below by a very general regularisation @xmath37 , thereby ensuring that our results are _ regularisation independent _ ( within the class of",

    "the technical proofs allowing for the application of the fixed point theorem are deferred to appendix [ a ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we study boundedness properties of the regularised geodesics which are essential when dealing with their limits in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "there we show that the solutions of the regularised geodesic equation converge , as the regularisation parameter goes to zero , to geodesics of the background ( anti-)de sitter spacetime which have to be matched appropriately across the impulse and have been derived previously in @xcite .",
    "overly technical calculations are collected in appendix [ b ] .",
    "in this section we detail our regularisation approach and derive the respective geodesic equations . to begin with , however , we recall the @xmath0-dimensional formalism of @xcite for the full class of nonexpanding impulsive waves with non - vanishing @xmath2 . to this end",
    "we start with the 5-dimensional impulsive _ pp_-wave spacetime @xmath38 with metric ( extending ) @xmath39 and consider the four - dimensional ( anti-)de sitter hyperboloid @xmath40 given by the constraint @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 are null - coordinates . here",

    "observe , that @xmath73 denotes the derivative with respect to an affine parameter @xmath74 which we have suppressed in the equations . here and in the following we also adopt the convention that greek indices @xmath75 take all values @xmath76 while the indices @xmath77 are restricted to the values @xmath78 and @xmath79 run from @xmath80 to @xmath81 only .    obviously , these equations reduce to the geodesic equations of the ( anti-)de sitter background off the impulse located at @xmath47 . also observe that the first equation decouples from the rest of the system and can be easily integrated .",
    "consequently @xmath25 can be used as a parameter of the remaining equations , a fact which is essential for the analysis of the system presented in ( * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , there the geodesics of the ( anti-)de sitter background in front and behind the wave impulsive are matched using a natural ansatz for solutions in the entire spacetime .",
    "however , this procedure has to be viewed as being only heuristic since the solution s @xmath82-components are ( assumed to be ) continuous but not @xmath83 , while the @xmath84-component is ( assumed to be ) even discontinuous . consequently the solutions can not be plugged back into the equations due to the occurrence of undefined products of distributions , and so the question arises in which sense they actually solve the equations , see the discussion at the end of sec.4 of @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar to the one encountered for impulsive _",
    "pp_-waves with @xmath3 and we refer to the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii ) as well as to the general discussion in @xcite .    to resolve this open problem",
    "we now employ a regularisation approach and detail the setting we are working with : to begin with we replace the dirac-@xmath35 in the line element by a fairly general class of smooth approximations called _ model delta nets_. chose an arbitrary smooth function @xmath85 on @xmath86 with unit integral and its support contained in @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "then for @xmath88 set @xmath89 we now consider for fixed @xmath90 $ ] the five - dimensional sandwich wave @xmath91 and define the spacetime of our interest as @xmath92 given by the constraint , i.e. , @xmath93 observe that while the differential @xmath94 is independent of @xmath95 , the normal vector @xmath96 depends on @xmath95 .",
    "indeed we choose to work with the _ non - normalised _",
    "normal vector @xmath97 to @xmath62 given by @xmath98 the non - zero christoffel symbols of are given by @xmath99 and the geodesics of @xmath92 are now characterised by @xmath100 where ( suppressing the parameter ) we write @xmath101 for the geodesics with tangent @xmath102 and @xmath103 denotes the levi - civita connection of . by a straightforward calculation",
    "we now obtain @xmath104 where we have used the abbreviations @xmath105 observe that since the @xmath106-norm of the tangent vector @xmath107 is constant along the geodesic @xmath108 , we have chosen it also to be constant in @xmath95 , which means that we have fixed the normalisation independently of @xmath95 .",
    "finally we obtain the following explicit form of the geodesic equations @xmath109 where we again have suppressed the parameter @xmath74 as well as the dependencies on the variables . however , note that always @xmath110    the right hand sides of these equations are considerably more complicated than their ` distributional counterparts ' in , the reason being that in the regularised equations the distributional identities @xmath111 and @xmath112 do not apply . indeed",
    "the lack of the first one leads to the more complicated form of the normal vector ( see ) and is reflected in the second summand in the denominator of . on the other hand",
    "the lack of the second one is responsible for the different form of the terms involving @xmath113 as compared to the ones involving @xmath114 ( cf .  ) in , to which they reduce in the limit @xmath115 .",
    "finally the terms proportional @xmath116 which occur in all four equations vanish in the limit @xmath115 again due to the first identity .",
    "the same holds true for the term proportional to @xmath117 contained in the first equation . in this sense",
    "the equations converge weakly to as @xmath115 .    the more complicated form of the system , in particular , results in the fact that the @xmath118-equation does _ not decouple _ from the rest of the system and consequently @xmath25 can not be used as a parameter along the geodesics .",
    "this issue greatly complicates our analysis .",
    "however , the @xmath119-equation still is linear and decoupled , hence can be simply integrated once the rest of the system is solved .",
    "in this section we prove an existence and uniqueness result for solutions of the initial value problem for that additionally guarantees that the geodesics that enter the sandwich region @xmath120 $ ] at one side exist long enough to leave it on the other side .",
    "this allows us to obtain global solutions of the geodesic equations , since outside the strip @xmath121 the spacetime coincides with the background ( anti-)de sitter universe .",
    "observe that for fixed @xmath95 the equations are smooth and hence a local solution is guaranteed to exist . however , the time of existence might depend on @xmath95 and in principle could even shrink to zero as @xmath115 .",
    "so the main objective here is to provide a result which guarantees that the time of existence is independent of @xmath95 , and large enough such that the solutions pass through the regularisation sandwich ( at least for all small @xmath95 ) .",
    "to this end we employ a fixed point argument in the spirit of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) based on weissinger s fixed point theorem ( @xcite ) . however , the significant increase in the complexity of the equations forces the use of new ideas to derive the required estimates .",
    "in particular , since it is not possible to use the @xmath25-coordinate as a parameter along the geodesics , the ` singular terms ' such as @xmath37 are composed with the @xmath25-coordinate of the solution @xmath118 , see .",
    "we have separated the technical proofs preparing the grounds for the application of the fixed point theorem from the main line of arguments and have deferred them to appendix  [ a ] .",
    "let us start by giving the general setup .",
    "consider any geodesic @xmath122 on the background ( anti-)de sitter universe _ without _ impulsive wave but reaching @xmath123 .",
    "all other geodesics are not of interest to the present analysis and will be dealt with separately .",
    "we choose an affine parameter @xmath74 in such a way that @xmath124 and assume @xmath125 to be normalised by @xmath126 .",
    "such geodesics can explicitly be written as @xmath127 in the cases @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , respectively , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 33 ) ) .",
    "recall that the case @xmath128 corresponds to null geodesics in both de sitter and anti - de sitter space , while the case @xmath131 corresponds to timelike geodesics in de sitter as well as to spacelike geodesics in anti - de sitter spacetime , and finally @xmath130 describes spacelike geodesics in de sitter and timelike geodesics in anti - de sitter space . without loss of generality",
    "we assume the constant @xmath132 to be positive can be treated in complete analogy .",
    "] so that in all three cases @xmath25 is increasing ( at least for @xmath133 $ ] ) .",
    "it is thus most convenient to prescribe initial data at @xmath134 , that is we set @xmath135 where the constants satisfy the constraints @xmath136 which are simply consequences of the fact that we are dealing with @xmath61 on the ( anti-)de sitter manifold , see .",
    "note however that @xmath137 , so the last term on the left hand side of either condition actually vanishes .",
    "in addition the normalisation condition @xmath138 holds .",
    "now we start to think of @xmath61 as a geodesic in the impulsive wave spacetime , _ ` in front ' of the impulse _ that is for @xmath139 . also ,",

    "more precisely , we have @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , respectively for the three cases in , leading to @xmath147 in the latter cases and hence overall @xmath148 for some positive constant @xmath149 .    [ fig1 ]    to investigate the geodesics in the regularised spacetime , , which is the main topic of this paper , we follow @xmath61 up to the beginning of wave zone , i.e. , up to @xmath150 , and then extend it ( smoothly ) to a geodesic @xmath151 solving the regularised geodesic equations .",
    "this means @xmath108 at @xmath141 assumes the data ( see figure  1 ) @xmath152 observe that by smoothness of @xmath61 the data @xmath153 and @xmath154 converge to @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively , as @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , by a mean value argument and we even have @xmath157 where @xmath158 is any riemannian",

    "next we make sure that the solutions just obtained , which by construction enter the wave zone at @xmath166 at parameter time @xmath167 with positive speed @xmath168 , in fact _ leave the sandwich region _",
    ", that is they reach @xmath169 within their time of existence @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , they naturally extend to the background _",
    "( anti-)de sitter universe ` behind ' _ the sandwich region . observe that here it is vital that @xmath29 in is independent of @xmath95 .",
    "[ thm : global ] the unique smooth geodesics @xmath108 of theorem [ thm : ex ] extend to geodesics of the background ( anti-)de sitter spacetime ` behind ' the sandwich wave zone .",
    "let @xmath101 be the unique solution of , given by theorem [ thm : ex ] . by the definition of the ` solution space ' @xmath170",
    "( see ) we obtain @xmath171 since @xmath172 by .",
    "so for such @xmath95 the geodesic @xmath108 leaves the wave zone and extends to a geodesic of the background spacetime since the geodesic equations coincide with the geodesic equations of the background ( anti-)de sitter spacetime for @xmath173 .",
    "recall that by construction the global geodesic @xmath101 with data of theorem [ thm : global ] for @xmath174 , i.e.  ` in front ' of the sandwich , coincide for all ( small ) @xmath95 with the single ` seed geodesic ' @xmath61 with data .",

    "moreover , at @xmath180 the regularised metric @xmath106 and the background metric @xmath181 coincide and so the data of @xmath182 is constrained and normalised with respect to the background spacetime .",
    "while the preservation of the constraints confirms the consistency of our construction , the preservation of the normalisation , in particular , implies that the causal character of @xmath108 ( and @xmath182 ) is the same as the one of the ` seed ' @xmath61 .",
    "note that the geodesic @xmath183 ` behind ' the regularisation sandwich depends on @xmath95 ( only ) via this initial data .",
    "interestingly , as we will detail in section [ sec5 ] , for @xmath184 the family of geodesics @xmath108 of the regularised spacetime converges for @xmath115 to a unique geodesic @xmath185 in the background with data given by the limits of .",
    "this will explicitly describe the effect of the _ impulsive _ gravitational wave on the geodesics in ( anti-)de sitter universe .",
    "[ fig2 ]    in the remainder of this section we will formulate completeness results for the regularised spacetimes . first we remark that actually our results allow us to make the smallness assumption on @xmath95 precise : @xmath95 has to be smaller than @xmath160 constrained by .",
    "this , however , means that the specific @xmath95 from which on a certain geodesic @xmath108 becomes complete depends on its data , i.e. , on the seed geodesic , and there is in general _ no global @xmath95 _ from which on _ all _ geodesics hence the spacetime is complete .",
    "a ` global ' completeness result in the spirit of @xcite , however , can be obtained using the geometric theory of generalised functions ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.3 ) ) and we reserve its detailed presentation for future work .    to formulate completeness results in our current setting , the dependence of @xmath95 on the data discussed above also makes it necessary to be careful about global effects .",
    "indeed , geodesics in the background spacetimes with @xmath186 , that is spacelike geodesics in de sitter space and timelike geodesics in anti - de sitter space are periodic .",
    "consequently geodesics @xmath108 in the regularised spacetimes constructed from such ` seed geodesics ' @xmath61 will share their causal character ( see remark [ rem : c+n ] ) and hence cross the wave zone infinitely often and we ( have to ) ( re)apply theorems [ thm : ex ] , [ thm : global ] again and again .",
    "however , note that the geodesics may enter the regularisation sandwich region each time with different data .",
    "so the @xmath95 from which on theorem [ thm : global ] applies may in principal become smaller and smaller on successive crossings with no positive infimum .",
    "in such a case , given an initial geodesic @xmath61 as in and given any finite number @xmath65 of crossings we can specify an @xmath95 from which on the geodesic @xmath108 extends to cross the wave zone @xmath65-times . however , we can not give a ( global ) @xmath95 for which the geodesic @xmath108 extends to all ( positive ) values of its affine parameter .",
    "consequently we prefer to avoid multiple crossings of the impulse in the formulation of our results by restricting to causal geodesics in the de sitter - case ( neglecting unphysical tachyons only ) and working with the universal covering spacetime in case of anti - de sitter space .",
    "note also that in our discussion so far ( see the specification of the ` seed geodesics ' @xmath61 at the beginning of this section ) we have exclusively dealt with geodesics with non - constant @xmath25-component .",
    "hence it remains to deal with geodesics travelling parallel to the surface @xmath47 . in case @xmath187 the geodesic will never enter the sandwich region of the regularised spacetime , provided @xmath95 is small enough . staying entirely on the constant curvature background such",
    "a geodesic clearly is complete . to discuss the geodesics with @xmath123 ,",
    "observe that the surface @xmath47 is totally geodesic ( not only in the background but also ) in the regularised spacetime , which can be seen from the @xmath25-component of the geodesic equations ( see also @xcite , the discussion prior to thm .",
    "hence such geodesics have trivial @xmath25-components and consequently the system reduces to the background geodesic equations which again leads to completeness .",
    "so we finally arrive at :    [ thm : compl_plus ] every causal geodesic in the entire class of regularised nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves propagating in de sitter universe ( i.e. , , with @xmath49 and a smooth profile function @xmath22 ) is complete , provided the regularisation parameter @xmath95 is chosen small enough .",

    "this means that the formal distributional form of the impulsive metric , is understood as a limit of a family of spacetimes with ever shorter but ever stronger sandwich gravitational waves , of an _ arbitrary smooth profile @xmath37_.    although the resulting regularized geodesic equations form a highly complicated coupled system , we were able to prove in section [ sec3 ] the existence and uniqueness of geodesics crossing the wave impulse , leading to completeness results , see theorems  [ thm : ex ] ,  [ thm : global ] and [ thm : compl_plus ] ,  [ thm : compl_minus ] .",
    "observe that , in particular , we prove that the geodesics of the regularised spacetime hitting the wave zone and hence interacting _ nonlinearly _ with the impulse actually cross it .",
    "this is a physical information not provided by the approach of @xcite in which this feature is built into the heuristic ansatz .",

    "there we have extended the range of applicability of this kind of fixed point techniques , originating in @xcite and generalised in @xcite , to a far more involved situation where the higher order ` contraction estimate ' contains a term proportional to @xmath274 , cf .  .",
    "in this way we have pushed on the crucial point of the method to the estimate , cf.the remark in the middle of page below the proof of proposition [ self ] .",
    "this raises hopes that these techniques can be extended to the even wilder ` @xmath275-dimensional ' distributional form of the metric in the future .    in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we studied boundedness properties of the global geodesics in the regularized spacetimes .",
    "these technical results , summarized in proposition  [ prop : bounds ] , were essential for performing their limits in the final section [ sec5 ] . due to the complexity of the system of geodesic equations it seemed advisable to simplify the ` usual arguments ' in this limiting procedure .",
    "we have done so by abstracting from the concrete form of the ( limiting ) geodesics and repeatedly using continuous dependence of solutions of odes on its data . in this way we were able to show that ,",
    "as the regularisation parameter goes to zero , the solutions of the regularised geodesic equation converge to unique geodesics of the background ( anti-)de sitter spacetime ( theorem  [ prop : lim1 ] ) which have to be matched appropriately across the impulse .",
    "in fact , we rigorously derived the explicit form of these matching conditions ( some overly technical related calculations are contained in appendix [ b ] ) .",
    "the resulting coefficients of proposition  [ prop : explicit_limits ] fully agree with previous results derived by a heuristic approach in  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the impulsive limit is completely independent of the specific regularization , i.e. , in the limit @xmath276 it is _ the same for any smooth profile _ of the sandwich gravitational waves .    finally ,",
    "as mentioned in the introduction in  @xcite , we have recently investigated the complete family of nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves propagating in spaces of constant curvature ( minkowski , de sitter and anti - de sitter universes ) employing the ( lipschitz ) _ continuous form of the metric _  .",
    "using filippov s solution concept for differential equations with discontinuous right hand side we proved existence and uniqueness of continuously differentiable geodesics . in section  4 of  @xcite",
    "we explicitly derived such geodesics using a @xmath83-matching procedure resulting in specific matching conditions , namely equations  ( 4.4)(4.10 ) of  @xcite .",
    "a natural question thus arises about the mutual consistency of the two results , both obtained in a rigorous way but starting from two different forms of the metric , namely the continuous form of the metric ( employed in  @xcite ) and the distributional form of the metric in the context of the @xmath0-dimensional embedding formalism ( employed here and in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it was shown in the recent work  @xcite that the _ matching conditions _ of @xcite and @xcite _ are fully equivalent _ when appropriate coordinate transformations are applied .",
    "this result confirms that both our approaches are consistent .",
    "it follows that the understanding of geodesics in the complete family of spacetimes with nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves and any cosmological constant now rests on firm mathematical grounds .",
    "these results set the stage for a sound mathematical analysis of the ` discontinuous coordinate transformations ' between the continuous and the distributional forms of the metric .",
    "together with the results of @xcite is seems now feasible to rigorously relate the continuous form of the metric to the ` @xmath0-dimensional ' distributional form , . on the other hand the technical advances of the fixed point techniques made here",
    "might eventually bring into reach a direct approach on the mathematical intricacies of the transformation .",

    "to do so , we only have to prove existence of the @xmath118 and @xmath195-components , since the equation for @xmath119 decouples and is linear , hence can then be solved on the domain of existence of ( @xmath118 , @xmath195 ) .",
    "moreover , the sign - difference between the @xmath277-equations and the @xmath278-equation can safely be ignored in the estimates leading to the fixed point argument .",

    "we need the following auxiliary estimate which is proven by a combination of ( i ) and ( ii ) in lemma [ prop : est_deltau ] : @xmath395 where @xmath396 .    abbreviating @xmath397 we are able to estimate @xmath398 by using and lemma [ prop : est_deltau ] .    the final term in @xmath399 , i.e.",
    ", @xmath400 can be estimated in perfect analogy to the previous terms inserting and subtracting appropriate terms wherever necessary to arrive at an estimate proportional to @xmath401 .",
    "the ` spatial component ' @xmath348 of the solution operator can be treated in a similar way .",
    "the only new aspect when estimating @xmath402 is the following .",
    "when bounding terms like @xmath403 by multiples of @xmath401 we find that they are no longer multiplied by @xmath404 and @xmath405 , respectively .",
    "thus we can not use the auxiliary result and consequently terms proportional to @xmath274 remain .",

    "summing up we arrive at @xmath406 where @xmath149 is some constant ( as above depending on @xmath22 , @xmath85 , etc . ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath340 we obtain the same estimate for the zeroth order , i.e. , @xmath407 , and hence @xmath408    finally , for higher powers of @xmath299 we obtain ( using ) @xmath409 where @xmath410 ( @xmath387 ) .    at this point",
    "we finally obtain the existence of a unique solution to in @xmath170 for all fixed small @xmath95 by applying weissinger s fixed point theorem ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the factor @xmath411 in the estimate provided by proposition [ prop : weiss ] does not cause any trouble .",
    "its only effect is that the approximating sequence @xmath412 converges to the fixed point slower as @xmath95 gets smaller .",
    "nevertheless we obtain a fixed point for every fixed ( small ) @xmath95 :    [ thm : exmat ] consider the system with initial data , satisfying , .",
    "then for all @xmath159 where @xmath160 is constrained by and for @xmath29 given by we have a unique smooth solution @xmath163 on @xmath162 $ ] .",

    "propositions [ self ] and [ prop : weiss ] allow the application of weissinger s fixed point theorem ( @xcite ) for fixed @xmath414 and suitable @xmath29 , providing thus a unique fixed point for the operator @xmath299 on the space @xmath170 which in turn gives a unique @xmath24-solution @xmath284 on @xmath162 $ ] to the system with data .",
    "moreover , since the right hand sides of are smooth the solution is smooth as well .",
    "the solution obtained via the fixed point argument is unique in the space @xmath170 and thereby unique among all smooth solutions assuming this data by the usual argument from ode - theory .",

    "the sign - difference between the @xmath419-components and @xmath420 is minor and to simplify the notation we will use a similar convention as in appendix [ a ] and write @xmath421 and @xmath422 instead of @xmath195 and @xmath82 and analogously for their derivatives .",
