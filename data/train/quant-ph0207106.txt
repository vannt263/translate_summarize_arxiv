    "originally , the casimir effect was predicted as a feature of the electromagnetic field between two neutral ideally conducting plates and consisted in the appearance of an attractive force between the plates .",
    "the force is due to the change of the zero - point energy of the field in the confined space @xcite . in this special case , however , the casimir force can also be viewed as the long - range van der waals force @xcite .",
    "it becomes appreciable in the submicron and rapidly increases in the nanometer range .",
    "as such , it may strongly affect processing in nanotechnology as well as functioning of micro- and nanomachines and devices @xcite .",
    "clearly , these new developments pose the problem of realistic calculations of the casimir force on objects in complex enviroments .",
    "in contrast to the highly idealized system considered by casimir @xcite , lifshitz @xcite calculated the force between two thick ( semi - infinite ) dielectric slabs by taking into account the dispersion and absorption in the dielectrics as well as the temperature effects . in this respect ,",
    "his theory is far more realistic and , as the effects of finite conductivity and dissipation in the metal can be observed in the recent high - precision experiments @xcite , his result for the force at zero temperature is standardly used when analyzing the casimir force in the planar geometry @xcite .",
    "the lifshitz approach is based on the calculation of the electromagnetic field due to the randomly fluctuating currents in the dielectric slabs and on the subsequent calculation of the maxwell stress tensor in the region inbetween .",
    "owing to its complexity , however , it has never been extended to the calculation of the force between multilayered stacks although the generalization of the final result to this configuration is fairly obvious .    the casimir effect in multilayered systems is usually considered using either the surface mode summation method @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) to calculate the change in the electromagnetic field zero - point energy due to the presence of the dielectric stacks , or the stress tensor method @xcite to calculate directly the vacuum field pressure on the stacks . strictly speaking",
    ", the mode summation method applies only to purely dispersive ( lossless ) systems as only in this case the mode frequencies are real .",
    "however , when expressed as an integral over the imaginary frequency , the final result for the casimir energy ( force ) turns out to be applicable to absorbing systems as well .",
    "an indication that this must be so is the fact that the dielectric function is always real on the imaginary axis irrespective of whether the system is absorbing or not @xcite .",
    "thus , while in their calculation of the force in a multilayer zhou and spruch @xcite assumed a purely dispersive system , klimchetskaya _",
    "et al_. @xcite recently considered a similiar but absorbing system .    on the other hand , being a local approach",
    ", the stress tensor method does not necessarily imply a lossless system .",
    "since the stress tensor can not be defined macroscopically for an absorbing medium @xcite , the only necessary assumption is actually that the region where the vacuum - field pressure is calculated is nonabsorbing , whereas the other parts of the system may generally be dissipative . despite this fact , numerous papers in the past used the stress tensor method to calculate the casimir force assuming , at most , a dispersive but nonabsorbing system .",
    "one of the reasons for that is certainly lack of knowledge on the proper form and properties of macroscopic field operators aproppriate for an absorbing system at that time .",
    "the first calculation of the casimir force between two absorbing slabs is due to kupiszewska @xcite who modeled dielectric atoms as a collection of harmonic oscillators coupled to a heat bath that absorbs energy .",
    "only the modes propagating normally to the slabs were considered , so that this approach was effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) . describing the reservoir through a damping constant and the langevin force and solving for the field operators , kupiszewska obtained for the force between the slabs the same expression in terms of their reflection coefficients as that obtained previously for an inert @xcite or a lossless @xcite 1d system , except that this time the dielectric function of the slabs was complex .",
    "recently , this result was rederived using a green function method for quantizing the macroscopic field in ( 1d ) absorbing systems in conjuction with a scattering matrix approach @xcite and was also extended to two identical absorbing superlattices @xcite .",
    "very recently , esquivel - sirvent _ et al_. demonstrated an alternative green function approach that makes the quantization of the field within the slabs unnecessary and calculated the casimir force in an asymmetric configuration @xcite which was earlier considered only in the lossless case @xcite .",
    "owing to their complex structure , an explicit calculation of the field operators as in refs .",
    "@xcite is highly impractical in the general case of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) dissipative inhomogeneous system .",
    "however , as pointed recently by matloob @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) , using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the linear response theory , the field correlation functions needed to calculate the stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the ( classical ) green function for the system . in this way , only the knowledge of the green function is , therefore , actually needed to calculate the casimir force . using this method ,",
    "matloob and falinejad recently considered the casimir force between two identical absorbing dielectric slabs @xcite . very recently",
    "et al_. @xcite generalized their green function method @xcite to three dimensions and calculated the casimir force between two arbitrary slabs .",
    "expressing the reflection coefficients of the slabs through the generalized surface impedances , these authors argued that their formal result could be applied to rather general but not chiral media , also including nonlocal inhomogeneous dissipative slabs . in refs .",
    "@xcite the space between the slabs was assumed empty .    in this work",
    "we calculate the casimir force in a lossless dispersive layer of an otherwise absorbing multilayer by employing the macroscopic field operators as emerge from a recently developed scheme for quantizing the electromagnetic field in inhomogeneous dissipative 3d - systems @xcite and using a convenient green function for a multilayer @xcite . in this way",
    ", we obtain a general result for the casimir force in stratified local media .",
    "in addition , using the properties of the generalized fresnel coefficients , we derive a relationship between the casimir force and energy in two different layers and demonstrate the applicability of the theory to more complex planar systems by calculating the casimir force on a diectric slab in a realistic planar cavity .",
    "consider a multilayered system described by the dielectric function @xmath0 defined in a stepwise fashion , as depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the casimir force in a layer corresponds to the net vacuum - field pressure in the multilayer with respect to the pressure in the infinite layer ( medium ) .",
    "accordingly , the force @xmath1 on a stack of layers that separates a @xmath2th and an @xmath3th layer is given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the @xmath6 component of the regularized stress tensor in the @xmath2th layer @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the corresponding maxwell stress tensors in the multilayer and in the infinite medium ( @xmath2 ) , respectively .",
    "( [ flj ] ) , @xmath10 is the area of the stack and the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) sign applies if @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "since the regularized stress tensor vanishes in the outmost layers , we have for @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 so that @xmath5 coincides with the force per unit area acting on the left ( right ) stack of layers bounding the layer ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "replacing field variables in the classical maxwell stress tensor @xcite by the corresponding heisenberg operators and taking its average @xcite , @xmath18 in a lossless layer @xmath19 [ @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where we have suppressed the argument @xmath22 of the field operators and the brackets denote the expectation value in the vacuum state of the field . in order to calculate the correlation functions that appear in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , we use the properties of the macroscopic field operators appropriate for absorbing systems @xcite .",
    "these operators are decomposed into their `` annihilation '' and `` creation '' components according to @xmath23 and , with the constitutive relations @xmath24 @xmath25 obey the standard macroscopic maxwell equations . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the noise polarization operators related to the dissipation in the system and obeying the commutation rules ( in the dyadic form ) : @xmath28 = \\frac{\\hbar\\varepsilon''({\\bf r},\\omega)}{4\\pi^2 } \\tensor{\\bf i}\\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}')\\delta(\\omega-\\omega ' ) , \\label{pp}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the unit dyadic .",
    "therefore , any ( annihilation ) field operator is related to @xmath26 via the classical green function @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 \\tensor{\\bf g}({\\bf r},{\\bf r'};\\omega)=4\\pi\\tensor{\\bf i } \\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r ' } ) \\label{gf}\\ ] ] according to @xmath32 as a consequence , all field correlation functions can be expressed through the green function in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite . in particular , for the electric - field correlation function we have @xcite @xmath33 and the magnetic - field correlation function is easily obtained from this expression using @xmath34 .    applying the above results to the @xmath2th layer and taking into account that @xmath35 is real and that @xmath36 in this region",
    ", we find for the relevant correlation functions in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) :    [ cf ] @xmath37 @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the wave vector in the layer , @xmath40 is the green function element for @xmath41 and @xmath42 both in the layer @xmath19 , and @xmath43 is the corresponding green function element for the magnetic field . with the above equations inserted in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , the stress tensor @xmath18 is expressed entirely in terms of the green function and its derivatives analogously to eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) below .",
    "similarly , through eqs .",
    "( [ t ] ) and ( [ cf ] ) applied to the infinite medium ( @xmath2 ) , the stress tensor @xmath44 is given by the same expression with the infinite - medium green function @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the regularized stress tensor @xmath5 is expressed as @xmath46 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+g^{b,\\rm sc}_{j , zz}({\\bf r},{\\bf r};\\omega)- g^{b,\\rm sc}_{j,\\parallel}({\\bf r},{\\bf r};\\omega)\\right\\ } , \\label{tr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the green function for the scattered field in the @xmath2th layer and @xmath48 is its parallel trace .",

    "@xcite . in the appendix we quote this green function and calculate the expression in the curly brackets of eq .",

    "we see that the regularized stress tensor is uniform across the layer .",
    "although expected on invariance grounds , this is not a trivial result and , as is clear from the derivation in the appendix , it is due to cancellation of the @xmath57-dependent terms in the electric and magnetic contributions to @xmath5 irrespective of the dielectric properties of the surrounding stacks .",
    "knowing the force , the casimir energy @xmath58 in the layer can be calculated using @xmath59 with the condition that @xmath60 for @xmath61 . from eqs .",

    "( [ f ] ) and ( [ trf ] ) ] , agrees in form with the corresponding result of zhou and spruch @xcite derived using the ( surface ) mode summation method and starting from a simple model of a purely dispersive multilayer .",
    "however , in this work the contributions of all ( propagating and evanescent ) modes are naturally taken into account on an equal footing through the green function . furthermore , since the green function employed refers to a general absorbing multilayer , so do the obtained results except , of course , for the region where the casimir force is calculated .",
    "the casimir energy and force vary in a stepwise fashion across the multilayer and we end this section by pointing out a relationship that exists between their values in two different layers , say , layers ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 ) . indeed , assuming that @xmath13 , for example , and using recursion relations for the reflection coefficients given by eq .",

    "most of the previously obtained results for the casimir force and energy in a specific planar configuration are recovered from the results derived in the preceding section simply by specifying the corresponding reflection coefficients and material parameters .",
    "thus , for example , the results for the three - layer ( @xmath70 ) configuration considered by lifshitz @xcite are obtained letting @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 are single - interface reflection coefficients given by eq .",
