    "the search for characteristic timescales in the x - ray variability of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been a long - standing problem .",
    "the x - ray power spectra have been difficult to measure due to a lack of the combination of instrument sensitivity and long , uninterrupted exposures .",
    "exosat _ has provided the best measurements ( see lawrence & papadakis 1993 ; green , mchardy and lehto 1993 ; czerny and lehto 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "( 1993 ) , from an analysis of the entire _ exosat _ agn database found only nine sources with data of sufficient quality to measure the power spectrum , six of these in the range @xmath7 hz and the remaining three ( ngc 4051 , ngc 5548 and mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 ) in the range @xmath8 hz .",
    "( 1993 ) and lawrence and papadakis ( 1993 ) found the power spectra to be featureless with mean power - law indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "no breaks in the power spectra were found in the measured frequency ranges .",
    "however there have been reports of peaks in the _ exosat _ x - ray power spectra of three agn ; at @xmath11 hz and/or @xmath12 hz in ngc 4151 ( fiore , massaro , and perola , 1989 ) ; at @xmath13 hz in ngc 5548 ( papadakis and lawrence , 1993 ) , and at @xmath14 hz in ngc 4051 ( papadakis and lawrence , 1995 ; see also bao and ostgaard 1994 ) .",
    "all of these have yet to be confirmed with other missions .",
    "the problem is that after the demise of _ exosat _ and its highly eccentric orbit , the orbits of subsequent satellites have not been able to produce such long , essentially uninterrupted data streams .",
    "although sophisticated methods have been devised to analyse time - series with gaps ( e.g. see merrifield and mchardy , 1994 and references therein ) , interpretation of the resulting power - spectra , considering the complexities introduced by the ` window - function ' , is not straight - forward .",
    "the only other reports of ` characteristic timescales ' have come from a long - term variability analysis of ngc 4151 which showed evidence , albeit model - dependent , of three timescales , at @xmath15 s , 14 days and 183 days ( see papadakis and mchardy , 1995 ) .",
    "so far , a high - frequency cut - off in the x - ray power spectra of agn has not been observed .",
    "a search for this cut - off is important because it places hard physical constraints on the x - ray emission mechanism and/or the size of the region , and ultimately the mass of the putative black hole .",
    "so far , the best estimate of the minimum x - ray variability timescale has come , for only a few bright agn , from the points where their _ exosat _ power spectra hit the poisson noise ( green _ et al . _ 1993 ) .",
    "these timescales were all greater than @xmath16 s. in this paper we extend the search for a high - frequency cut - off in the power spectrum down to timescales of 20 s ( @xmath2 hz ) in the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 , utilizing high - sensitivity data taken with _",
    "asca _ , using a new method for analysing gapped time - series .",
    "we define the ` excess pair fraction ' ( hereafter @xmath17 ) as a function of the bin size , @xmath18 , of a given lightcurve . for each bin size",
    "we count the total number of adjacent pairs of _ non - empty _ bins and then compute the fraction of those pairs in which the number of counts in the two bins differ by , or more than , the sum of the square roots of the counts .",
    "this fraction is @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "if we observe @xmath20 counts in the first bin of a pair , for the second bin to contribute to @xmath19 it must have @xmath21 counts where @xmath22 .",
    "this has the solution that @xmath21 must _ not _ lie inside the range @xmath23 .",
    "the second bin is used as the first bin of the next pair tested , and so on .",
    "this definition of @xmath17 is equivalent to saying that in the gaussian limit , the counts in each bin of a pair must be separated by at least the sum of their standard deviations .    by definition",
    ", the @xmath17 characterizes the source variability on the timescale of the bin size and nothing in the definition requires uninterrupted data or inventing fictitious data in the gaps .",
    "all that is required is that there be enough adjacent pairs of bins .",
    "it is different to a @xmath24 test against a constant hypothesis as a function of bin size because the @xmath24 test is _ global _ in the sense that it searches for a variability trend over the entire observation relative to the mean level . on the other hand",
    ", the definition of @xmath19 does not refer to a mean , but rather , _ explicitly measures the bin - to - bin variability_. for example ,",
    "if a source showed significant variations on 10 s timescales but no longer term trends , @xmath25 would be larger than @xmath26 because the variability over @xmath27 s would be ` washed out ' .",
    "the definition of @xmath19 is also manifestly different to the excess variance ( e.g. nandra _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) which probes the _ integrated _ power spectrum .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of several simulations of the @xmath17 using @xmath28 bin - pairs for each case .",
    "the counts for each bin are drawn from a poisson distribution in which the mean count rate of the source changes from @xmath29 to @xmath30 between two adjacent bins in a pair , where @xmath31 is a uniform random deviate between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "curves of @xmath34 are shown for various values of @xmath35 in the range 0.01.0 where @xmath36 .",
    "for clarity , only the case of a constant source ( @xmath37 ) is shown down to @xmath38 ( filled circles ) .",
    "as @xmath39 tends to zero , @xmath34 for all @xmath35 tends to zero because of the condition in the definition of @xmath34 which excludes bin - pairs containing one or more empty bins . for a constant source ,",
    "@xmath34 is almost constant when we are well into the gaussian regime ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "figure 2a shows realistic simulations of @xmath19 for a @xmath41 day observation of a constant source with a count rate of 1.0 ct / s .",
    "the time - intervals for data - accumulation were identical to the good - time - intervals ( gti ) obtained from a real _ asca _ observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 ( see figure 3 and  [ appl ] ) .",
    "however , as is evident from the definition of @xmath19 , the results do not depend at all on the gti and @xmath19 is consistent with the expectation for a constant source observed with no gaps ( solid line , taken from the @xmath37 simulations in figure 1 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , @xmath19 can be extremely sensitive to variability .",
    "the 1.0 ct / s constant source in the above simulation was modulated with a sine wave of only 3% amplitude ( 6% peak - to - peak ) and a period of 367 s. the resulting @xmath19 is shown in figure 2b .",
    "not only is the variability easily detected , but the periodicity makes characteristic imprints on @xmath19 .",
    "namely , @xmath19 has minima at times equal to the period and its harmonics . in this example",
    ", we would be able to determine that 367 s is the fundamental period because no minimum is seen at half of this period .",
    "the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 ( @xmath42 ) has been extensively studied at x - ray and other wavelengths .",
    "it is one of the first agn in which evidence for relativistic effects on the fe - k line profile was found ( tanaka _ et al .",
    "_ asca _ observed mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 for over 4 days starting 1994 , july 23 ( these data have already been discussed in other contexts by iwasawa _",
    "_ 1996 , and otani _ et al .",
    "mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 is highly variable in the x - ray band ; the maximum 210 kev luminosity was over a factor of 7 greater than the minimum luminosity during the four - day observation , in the range @xmath43 ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "the 0.510 kev lightcurve obtained from the sis0 instrument is shown in figure 3 , binned at 512 s ( see tanaka _",
    "_ 1994 for details of the _ asca _ instrumentation ) .",
    "the reader is referred to nandra _",
    "( 1997 ) for details of the _ asca _ data reduction procedures which are very similar to the ones adopted here .",
    "we constructed lightcurves with a range of time - bin sizes from @xmath46 s up to @xmath47 s. all four instruments aboard _",
    "asca _ were utilized .",
    "partially - exposed bins were rejected .",
    "data in the 0.510 kev band were used for the two sis instruments and in the 0.710 kev band for the two gis instruments . however , since the time resolution of sis data is only 4 s , we did not use sis data for @xmath48 s , allowing sufficient time for several ccd - readouts .",
    "the time resolution of the gis data is 2 s or better ( depending on bit - rate ) .",
    "@xmath19 was then computed for each lightcurve .",
    "note that the lightcurves were _ not _ background - subtracted .",
    "even when the source has its minimum intensity ( see figure 3 ) , the background constitutes less than 11 % of the total counts and is not strongly variable ( see gendreau _",
    "1995 ) .",
    "if we average @xmath19 from different instruments we must model @xmath19 independently for the different instruments and then average the models in the same way as the data .",
    "this is because in general the count rates and gtis may be different for data from the different instruments , and @xmath19 is , for a given @xmath18 , fundamentally a function of the total number of counts per bin ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows , using the entire mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 observation , @xmath19 averaged over four instruments for @xmath49 s and over two instruments otherwise .",
    "the error bars are obtained from the square root of the number of bin - pairs contributing to @xmath19 divided by the total number of bin - pairs tested . for a given mean count rate , @xmath29",
    ", we can convert the @xmath34 models in figure 1 to @xmath19 by interpolation , using @xmath50 .",
    "the mean count rates were 1.83 , 1.49 , 0.96 , and 1.14 ct / s for sis0 , sis1 , gis2 and gis3 respectively . in figure 4 ,",
    "the predicted @xmath19 are shown for a source in which the bin - to - bin ratio of mean count rates is independent of @xmath18 and uniformly distributed in the range @xmath51 , for @xmath52 ( constant source ) , @xmath53 , and 0.20 ( dotted curves ) .",
    "it can be seen that the measurement errors cause the @xmath19 to hit the poisson noise below @xmath54 s. at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 hz ) we can say that the source variability is less than 7% ( @xmath57 ) at greater than @xmath58 , or greater than 99% confidence . at @xmath59 s , ( @xmath2 hz ) , approximately the smallest bin size obeying gaussian statistics , we can say that @xmath60 at @xmath61 ( 98.9 % confidence ) . at @xmath62 s ( @xmath1 hz )",
    "the variability is @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "note that the low - frequency measurement limit for @xmath19 depends on the typical duration of an uninterrupted data train ( e.g. satellite orbit ) and on the total duration of the observation .",
    "detailed fitting of the @xmath17 with models of power spectra will be presented elsewhere .",
    "what is important here is that the variability amplitude decreases steadily and smoothly down to at least 64 s ( @xmath3 hz ) .",
    "there are no sharp features or discontinuities in @xmath19 in the range @xmath65 s ( @xmath3 to @xmath1 hz ) .",
    "note that if variability ceased somewhere in the range @xmath66 s it would have been detected .",
    "yet @xmath67 is @xmath68 away from the value for a constant source so such a sharp break can be ruled out at @xmath69 confidence .",
    "the data are in fact compatible with @xmath70 .",
    "figure 4 ( solid line ) shows a comparison of the data with a model with @xmath71 ( normalization @xmath72 ) .",
    "these parameters were obtained from an ` eyeball fit ' and no attempt was made at formal fitting .",
    "note that @xmath73 is related to the power - law index of the power spectrum , @xmath74 , by @xmath75 .",
    "this is because @xmath19 is a function of the number of variable bins picked at a given frequency interval @xmath76 , and thus is a function of the power in that frequency interval .",
    "the power spectrum is defined as power per unit frequency so the power - law index for fitting @xmath19 must be lowered by unity .",
    "thus the data are consistent with @xmath77 in the range @xmath2 to @xmath1 hz , which is compatible with _ exosat",
    "_ measurements of mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 at lower frequencies ( e.g. @xmath78 by lawrence and papadakis 1993 and @xmath79 by green _",
    "_ 1993 ) .",
    "if the variability that is observed down to @xmath80 s ( @xmath5 hz ) is due to modulation by matter orbiting the putative black hole , then we can infer an upper limit on the black - hole mass by requiring that the emitting matter is not located closer than the radius for marginally stable circular orbits ( i.e. 3 schwarzschild radii ) .",
    "this condition means that the observed period , @xmath81 , for keplerian orbits around a schwarzschild and a maximally rotating kerr black hole is @xmath82 s and @xmath83 s respectively ( @xmath84 is the mass in units of @xmath85 )",
    ". then @xmath86 s implies @xmath87 for a schwarzschild metric and @xmath88 for a maximally rotating kerr metric .",
    "these masses are rather small and imply luminosities in excess of the eddington limit .",
    "this argues against the observed variability being due to orbital modulation .",
    "note that the upper limits on the black hole masses obtained by green _",
    "( 1993 ) are in error by a factor of 10 because the numerical factor in their equation 6 is incorrect and should be @xmath16 and not @xmath89 .",
    "also , they arbitrarily assume an orbital radius of 5 schwarzschild radii .",
    "these factors , along with the fact that the _ asca _ data detect variability at shorter timescales than the _ exosat _ data , explain why our upper limit for the black - hole mass in mcg -6 - 30 - 15 ( under the assumption of orbital modulation around a schwarzschild hole ) is a factor of 30 less than the green _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) estimate of @xmath90 .    clearly , to infer a source size from the fastest observed variability is too simplistic .",
    "instead , we have begun , for the first time , to probe the source sub - structure since the rapid variability may be produced by localized flares or hotspots .",
    "the lower limit on any break frequency of @xmath3 hz ( 64 s ) represents an upper limit ( @xmath91 ) only to the size of a region responsible for the shortest observed ( and low - amplitude ) variability , and not necessarily to the size of the source region as a whole .",
    "we have presented a new method for analysing gapped time - series which is capable of probing the power - spectrum of agn up to @xmath92 hz for sources with count rates of the order @xmath93 ct / s or more .",
    "we have applied the method to a four - day _ asca _ observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 to search for a high - frequency cut - off in the power spectrum .",
    "the data are consistent with a power - law power spectrum , with no break in the range @xmath1 hz to @xmath3 hz ( at a confidence level of 92% ) . the power - law index of the power spectrum in this range is consistent with @xmath4 . in the range",
    "@xmath3 hz to @xmath2 hz , the fluctuations in the intrinsic mean count rate of the source can be constrained to be less than 7% at greater than 99% confidence .",
    "it is likely that the observed variability is _ not _ due to orbital modulation since black hole masses of less than @xmath6 and super - eddington luminosities are implied .",
