    "[ fig : emission - spectra ] , solid lines ) and numerical calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : emission - spectra ] , dashed lines ) is obtained .",
    "both the spectral range of a nonzero radiated power and its absolute value are well represented using the fdtd method .",
    "the main difference can be traced back to fabry - perot - like oscillations of the radiated power due to the finite - size effects in the fdtd calculations . in the finite structure , the cherenkov radiated power stays considerably enhanced near the band edges having large but finite value .",
    "the total power oscillates around the analytical value becoming partially suppressed or enhanced for different frequencies . to confirm that these oscillations indeed result from the finite transverse dimension of the considered photonic crystal ,",
    "we have performed simulations for the crystal with a double thickness ( @xmath160 ) for the charge velocity @xmath128 .",
    "resulting radiated power spectrum is shown in the corresponding panel in figure  [ fig : emission - spectra ] as a dashed - dotted curve .",
    "one can see twice as many oscillations as in the case of the thinner structure , which is a typical signature of the fabry - perot like phenomena .",
    "the further enhancement of the radiated power in comparison to the infinite structure can be associated with the longer interaction time of the charge at resonance frequencies with the effectively slow fabry - perot modes of a photonic crystal slab .",
    "in this paper , analytical expression for the cherenkov power emitted per unit length of the charge trajectory in the case of a general 3d and 2d periodic dielectric medium has been derived .",
    "the obtained formula for the cherenkov power involves the calculations of bloch modes and corresponding group velocities at a limited number of points of the reciprocal space only , making the application of the proposed method computationally not demanding .",
    "all calculations have been performed on a desktop pc and our method requires 5 to 10 times less cpu time then fdtd method .",
    "the analysis of the cherenkov emission spectrum in the periodic medium reveals that the cherenkov effect indeed exists for every electron velocity .",
    "similar to the case of the modification of the dipole emission in a photonic crystal , the cherenkov radiation can be suppressed if the coupling of the current density produced by a moving electron with a bloch mode is poor . at the same time , an enhancement of the cherenkov radiation is possible also if only the component of the group velocity orthogonal to the electron trajectory is small .",
    "we have illustrated the developed analytical method and its conclusions using a numerically rigorous finite - difference time - domain method in a special case of a 2d photonic crystal and demonstrated a reasonable agreement between numerical and analytical results .",
