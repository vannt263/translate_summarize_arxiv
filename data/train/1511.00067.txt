    "the detection of periodically occurring transient vibration signatures is of vital importance for vibration - based condition monitoring and fault detection of rotating machinery @xcite .",
    "however , these useful transient features are usually buried in heavy background noise and other irrelevant vibrations . to address this problem ,",
    "many signal processing methods have been introduced , such as singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite , empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) @xcite , and methods based on different wavelet transforms , e.g. , dual - tree wavelet in @xcite , harmonic wavelet in @xcite , and tunable q - factor wavelet ( tqwt ) in @xcite .",
    "these methods have achieved successful applications in the field of machinery fault diagnosis .",
    "recently , an algorithm , called ` overlapping group shrinkage ' ( ogs ) was developed for estimating group - sparse signals in noise @xcite .",
    "the ogs algorithm was initially formulated as a convex optimization promoting group sparsity by a convex regularization . in order to promote sparsity more strongly , an improved version of ogs",
    "was developed , which utilizes a non - convex regularization @xcite .",
    "the superiority of denoising group - sparse signals using the approach presented in @xcite indicates its potential for effectively extracting periodic transient pulses .",
    "this paper aims to develop an approach for rotating machinery fault diagnosis based on a periodic group - sparse signal representation .",
    "the signature of localized faults of the gear teeth and bearing components generally exhibit periodic transient pulses when a rotating machine is operated at a constant speed @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the large amplitudes of these useful features are not only sparse but also tend to form groups .",
    "several neighborhood - based denoising methods have been developed for machinery fault diagnosis utilizing this property @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on a signal model intended to capture the useful impulsive features for machinery fault diagnosis .",
    "in particular , this paper addresses the problem of estimating @xmath0 from a noisy observation @xmath1 .",
    "we model the measured discrete - time series , @xmath1 , as @xmath2 where the signal @xmath0 is known to have a periodic group - sparse property and @xmath3 is white gaussian noise .",

    "conventionally , the regularizer @xmath10 is a convex function , e.g. @xmath11-norm . in @xcite , an idea of using non - convex regularizer and keeping the convexity of entire problem",
    "is used for signal denoising problem , where the sparsity can be significantly promoted comparing to @xmath11-norm , and the problem still has a unique solution due to the convexity .    in this paper , we adopt ideas from @xcite and @xcite , and present a method for estimating periodic - group - sparse signals in noise .",
    "we propose its use for detecting faults in rotating machinery , where the fault characteristic frequency ( period of the group - sparse pulses ) is used as prior knowledge .",
    "similar to the approach in @xcite , the non - convex regularization term in the proposed method is properly chosen so as to ensure that the total objective function @xmath12 is convex ; however , in contrast to @xcite , where each group has to be contiguous , we allow grouping with intervals , and furthermore periodically . as a consequence , in this work , the regularization term @xmath6 in is formulated specifically to utilize the periodicity of the impulsive fault features . the aim of our approach is to capture the useful impulsive features for the purpose of machinery fault diagnosis .",
    "additionally , it has the potential to separate compound fault features by utilizing different periods of the periodic transient pulses corresponding to different fault frequencies ( e.g. , various defect frequencies of rolling element bearings ) .",
