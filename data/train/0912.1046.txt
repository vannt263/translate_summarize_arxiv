    "it is hard to imagine yourself a world without integrable models .",
    "teaching in such a world would be rather frustrating . if a theory has no solvable examples , it is difficult to explain that it is useful",
    ". fortunately , in ours we have the harmonic oscillator  the guinea - pig which serves as pedagogical example for all theories .",
    "integrable models are exceptional , but we do not neglect them . still , as it was one century ago , finding a new non - trivially integrable model is a discovery .",
    "how we can find integrable systems ?",
    "one way , which seems to be the most natural , is just a search them in the nature .",
    "that is , start with more or less general model , and look for some special cases when the model is integrable .",
    "the other way is to construct integrable systems .",
    "it appears that the first approach is much more difficult than the second one .",
    "the reason of this is obvious : we know only few general methods which give strongly enough , and computable necessary conditions for the integrability .    in this paper",
    "we consider only classical dynamical systems which are described by ordinary differential equations .",
    "there is no a unique definition of such systems and there is no a unique method for study of their integrability .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we will concentrate mainly on applications of only one quite new theory .",
    "it was developed by baider , churchill , morales , ramis , rod , sim and singer in the end of the xx century , see @xcite and references therein . in the context of hamiltonian systems it is called the morales - ramis theory .",
    "it arose from very long searching for relations between the branching of solutions of differential equations considered as functions of complex time , and the integrability . in the context of hamiltonian systems these relations were found by s.  l.  ziglin  @xcite .",
    "his elegant theory expresses necessary conditions for the integrability in terms of properties of the monodromy group of variational equations along a particular solution .",
    "the morales - ramis theory , in some sense , is an algebraic version of the ziglin theory .",
    "it formulates the necessary conditions for the integrability in terms of the differential galois group of the variational equations .    during one and half decade",
    "the morales - ramis theory was applied successfully for study the integrability of numerous systems , see an overview paper  @xcite .",
    "let us mention two biggest successes of this theory .",
    "it was applied to prove the non - integrability of the planar three body problem @xcite , and to prove the non - integrability of the hill lunar problem  @xcite . moreover , as it is well known , the first proof of the fact that the problem of the heavy top is integrable only in the classical cases was done by  s.  l.  ziglin in  @xcite and it is based on his theory . an alternative proof based on differential galois approach is given in  @xcite .",
    "the above examples show the real power of the differential galois methods in a study of the integrability .",
    "during last ten years we applied them to study several hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian systems which appear in physics and astronomy , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "always a hidden dream of those investigations was a strong will to find an unexpectedly integrable system .",
    "however , for a long time , neither we , nor other authors succeeded with this respect .",
    "all those successful investigations gave negative results : the investigated systems are not integrable except already known integrable cases .",
    "in this paper our aim is to give an overview of our works concerning the integrability of hamiltonian systems with homogeneous potentials @xcite , and homogeneous newton equations @xcite .",
    "our motivation for those works was an optimistic plan to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the integrability .",
    "in other words , our dream was to find all possible integrable polynomial potentials and forces .",
    "amazingly enough this plan was not only a dream  we found its quite successful realisation .",
    "our investigations differ in many respects from typical applications of the morales - ramis theory . in a ` typical ' application of this theory",
    "there are two difficult problems : the first one is to find a particular solution , and the second is to determine the differential galois group of the variational equations along this solution . in this paper",
    "we investigate ` global ' multi - parameter problems .",
    "we know _ a priori _ a class of particular solutions and we know also the differential galois group for a given values of the parameters .",
    "the goal in our problem is to prove that the system is not integrable for all but finite number of parameters values . to achieve the desired result we developed a method which allows to deduce new obstructions for the integrability that come from a global analysis of all possible particular solutions of a given class .",
    "plan of this paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we overview various notions of the integrability of ordinary differential equations . in section  [ sec : gen ] we explain how the differential galois theory can be used for a study of their integrability . the morales - ramis theory , as well as the ziglin theory",
    "are dedicated for hamiltonian systems . in our presentation",
    "we show that , in fact , we can use the differential galois methods in a general context .",
    "one can find necessary conditions for the integrability defined adequately to the geometry of the considered equations and express these conditions in terms of properties of the differential galois group of variational equations .",
    "the next two sections  [ sec : morahom ] and [ sec : glob ] are devoted the integrability analysis of the class of homogeneous potentials .",
    "the homogeneity of the potential guarantees the existence of non - equilibrium particular solutions generated by so - called darboux points . in section  [ sec : morahom ] the necessary integrability conditions obtained from an application of the morales - ramis theory to a particular solution given by a darboux point are formulated . but",
    "these conditions are too weak for the ambitious classification programme of all integrable potentials . in section  [ sec : glob ] the additional integrability conditions obtained from the simultaneous analysis of all darboux points are formulated . in section  [ sec : newtony ] it was shown that various parts of analysis made for homogeneous potentials can be adapted for systems of newton equations with homogeneous velocity - independent forces . in final section  [ sec : open ] open problems and perspectives of the classification program of integrable systems are discussed .",
    "in this section we overview various notions of the integrability of systems of ordinary differential equations .",
    "let us consider a system of ordinary differential equations @xmath2 with smooth right - hand sides @xmath3 . as it was observed a long time ago , the knowledge of first integrals or other invariant quantities helps to find explicit solutions of this system .",
    "let us recall that a smooth function @xmath4 is a first integral of system iff it is constant along its solutions .",
    "thus , a constant value level of @xmath4 is a set invariant with respect to the flow of  .",
    "hence , roughly speaking , knowing a first integral we can reduce the dimension of the system by one .",
    "thus , if we know @xmath5 first integrals @xmath6 , which are functionally independent in a certain domain @xmath7 , then we can transform system   into the following one @xmath8 solutions of this equation can be find easily @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 in effect , we reduce the problem to calculation just one integral and inversion of a function . in the prescribed situation , we say that the considered system is _",
    "integrable by quadratures_. this notion plays a fundamental role .",
    "in fact , as we will see later , the other definitions of integrability give necessary conditions for the integrability by quadratures .",
    "a first integral of a given system is just an example of simplest tensor quantity which is invariant with respect to the flow of the system .",
    "a smooth tensor field @xmath12 is invariant with respect to the flow of the system   iff @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the lie derivative along vector field @xmath15 .",
    "the existence of a certain number of tensor invariants can guarantee that the integration of the system reduces to quadratures .",
    "below we give three examples of results of this type .",
    "the first of them , due to s.  lie , tells that system admitting @xmath16 linearly independent and commuting symmetries , i.e. , invariant vector fields , is integrable by quadratures .",
    "assume that system   admits @xmath16 independent and commuting symmetries @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "then the system is integrable by quadratures .",
    "a differential @xmath16-form @xmath19 in @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 it is invariant with respect to system   iff @xmath22 in the classical literature an invariant @xmath16-form is called the jacobi last multiplier .",
    "assume that system   admits @xmath23 functionally independent first integrals and invariant differential @xmath16-form .",
    "then the system is integrable by quadratures .",
    "[ thm : nic ]    proofs and detailed discussion of the above two theorems can be find , e.g. , in @xcite .    as we will see later",

    "if first integrals are independent on @xmath41 , then @xmath41 is a smooth manifold .",
    "but , even if @xmath41 is connected and compact , its topology can be very complicated .",
    "however , by the assumed @xmath29-integrability , we know that there exist independent and commuting vector fields @xmath42 tangent to @xmath41 , . thus , if @xmath43 is connected and compact it is diffeomorphic to @xmath26 dimensional torus @xmath44 , see chapter 10 , lemma  2 in @xcite . in a neighbourhood of",

    "in fact , the @xmath29-integrability was introduced as a certain generalisation of the integrability in the liouville sense .",
    "let us assume that system   is hamiltonian .",
    "then @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is a hamiltonian vector field generated by a smooth hamiltonian function @xmath52 .",
    "here we consider @xmath53 as a linear symplectic space with chosen canonical coordinates @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in these",

    "in this section we show how we can use the differential galois theory to find necessary conditions for the integrability of ordinary differential equations . to deduce such conditions we have to make several assumptions .",
    "the most general one is that the considered system as well as the considered first integrals , or other invariants , have ` good ' analytical properties .",
    "moreover , the theory requires that the ` scalars ' form an algebraically closed field .",
    "thus , we assume that this field is just the field of complex numbers @xmath68 .",
    "in effect we work with complex functions , complex vector fields , and so on .",
    "the above mentioned ` good ' analytical properties mean that the considered tensors are holomorphic at points where they are defined .",
    "let us consider a complex holomorphic system of ordinary differential equations @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an open and connected subset of @xmath71 .",
    "the basic assumption for further considerations is that we know a particular non - equilibrium solution @xmath72 of this system . usually it is not a single - valued function of the complex time @xmath73",
    "thus , we associate with @xmath72 a riemann surface @xmath74 with @xmath73 as a local coordinate .",
    "the variational equations along @xmath74 have the form @xmath75 the entries of matrix @xmath76 in the above equation are elements of field @xmath77 of functions meromorphic on @xmath74 .",
    "this field with the differentiation with respect to @xmath73 as a derivation is a differential field .",
    "only constant functions from @xmath78 have vanishing derivative , so the sub - field of constants of @xmath78 is @xmath68 .",
    "it is obvious that solutions of   are not necessarily elements of @xmath79 .",
    "the fundamental theorem of the differential galois theory guarantees that there exists a differential field @xmath80 such that @xmath16 linearly independent ( over @xmath68 ) solutions of   are contained in @xmath81 .",

    "is called the differential galois group of equation  .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath82 is a linear algebraic group .",
    "thus , in particular , it is a union of a finite number of disjoint connected components .",
    "one of them , containing the identity , is called the identity component and is denoted by @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 be a solution of equation  , and @xmath86 an element of its differential galois group @xmath87 .",
    "then , @xmath88 is also its solution .",

    "now , we explain how the existence of first integrals of system manifests itself in the properties of the differential galois group of variational equations . at first , we introduce some definitions .",
    "let us consider a holomorphic function @xmath4 defined in a certain connected neighbourhood of solution @xmath72 .",
    "in this neighbourhood we have the expansion @xmath94 then , the leading term @xmath95 of @xmath4 is the lowest order term of the above expansion i.e. , @xmath96 .",

    "@xmath97 is a homogeneous rational function of @xmath106 .",
    "it is easy to prove that if @xmath4 is a meromorphic ( holomorphic ) first integral of equation  , then its leading term @xmath95 is a rational ( polynomial ) first integral of variational equation  . if system   has @xmath107 functionally independent meromorphic first integrals @xmath108 , then their leading terms can be functionally dependent .",

    "[ lem : ratinv ]    as it was mentioned above , a differential galois group is a linear algebraic group , thus , in particular , it is a lie group , and one can consider its lie algebra .",

    "it is easy to show that if a lie group has an invariant , then also its lie algebra has an integral .",

    "secondly , commutation of first integrals imposed by the liouville integrability implies commutation of first integrals of variational equations .",

    "the reason is that the restriction imposed by the fixing of the eigenvalues is very rigid .",

    "the analysis of non - generic cases is much more involved but , nevertheless it can be made almost up to the end , see @xcite for details .",
    "in this section we consider the following class of newton s equations @xmath469 that we rewrite as a system of first order differential equations @xmath470 our aim is to investigate integrability properties of such equations .",
    "generally , the forces @xmath471 are not potential , so it can happen that these equations do not admit even a single first integral .",

    "equations   are integrable in the jacobi sense with first integrals which are meromorphic in a connected neighbourhood @xmath70 of phase curve @xmath187 with @xmath201 , and independent on @xmath488",
    ".    then pairs @xmath203 for @xmath204 belong to the morales - ramis table  .",
    "the above theorem is a generalisation of two theorems ( theorem  1.2 and theorem  1.3 ) from @xcite .",
    "here we remark that the similarity of the theses of theorem  [ thm : mora ] and theorem  [ thm : mu ] is somewhat misleading .",
    "the point is that in the case of newton equations we do not have any symplectic structure , and thus we have no all geometrical consequences of this fact . on the other hand ,",
    "the integrability in the jacobi sense requires ` big ' number of first integrals and exactly this requirement is the reason why the identity component of the differential galois group must be abelian .",
    "fact that we have theorem  [ thm : mu ] allows us to think about a global analysis similar to that we presented in section  [ sec : glob ] for the homogeneous potentials . in order to analyse this question",
    "we assume the force @xmath471 has polynomial components of the same degree @xmath489 , i.e. , @xmath490)^n$ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath491 the set of all darboux points of @xmath471 .",
    "it appears that a generic force has @xmath492/(k-2)$ ] darboux points ( considered as points in @xmath246 ) , i.e. , as many as a homogeneous potential @xmath173 of degree @xmath109 .",
    "it is rather amazing , because @xmath493 depends on @xmath494 parameters while @xmath471 depends on @xmath495 parameters , so in the second case the number of parameters is much bigger .    for @xmath245\\in{{\\mathscr d}}({{\\boldsymbol}{f } } ) $ ] , we denote eigenvalues of @xmath483 by @xmath496 , and we set @xmath497 , where @xmath498 , for @xmath299 .    for the considered newton equations we can apply all the methods and tools used for the homogeneous potentials that are described in section  [ sec : glob ] . in particular , we have the following .

    "this theorem has the same consequences for the jacobi integrability of homogeneous forces as theorem  [ thm:1 ] for the integrability of homogeneous potentials .",
    "namely , for a given @xmath109 , there is only a finite set of candidates for @xmath284 satisfying the necessary conditions for the jacobi integrability given by theorem  [ thm : kojot ] .",
    "hence , we can try to perform an analysis similar to that for homogeneous potentials , and find all integrable forces for small @xmath109 .",
    "such an analysis was performed in @xcite .",
    "it appears that for @xmath265 and @xmath441 almost all forces @xmath504\\times { { \\mathbb}{c}}_2[{{\\boldsymbol}{q}}]$ ] are potential . for @xmath442 and @xmath505",
    "several families of integrable forces were found . among them",
    "some intriguing non - trivial examples appear , e.g. , force with components @xmath506 is integrable in the jacobi sense , with two first integrals which are both of degree four with respect to the velocities .",
    "they have the following form @xmath507 it is also worth to mention a remarkable family of forces given by @xmath508 where @xmath233 is and @xmath509 .",
    "the newton equations with this force admit the following first integral @xmath510 if @xmath511 belongs to an item of the morales - ramis table  , then the system is integrable in the jacobi sense with an additional polynomial first integral @xmath463 .",
    "moreover , for an arbitrary @xmath291 we find @xmath211 such that the degree of @xmath463 with respect to the momenta is greater than @xmath512 , and there is no an additional polynomial first integral independent with @xmath462 and having degree with respect to the momenta smaller or equal to @xmath512 .",
    "additionally , if @xmath511 belongs to an item different from  2 in table  , then there exist two additional polynomial first integrals @xmath463 and @xmath513 which are functionally independent together with @xmath462 .",
    "the above statements were formulated in a form of a well justified conjecture in @xcite .",
    "let us consider a two degrees of freedom hamiltonian system with homogeneous polynomial potentials of degree @xmath233 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that if a potential of degree @xmath514 admits a polynomial first integral of degree higher than two with respect to the momenta , then this first integral is a product of polynomial first integrals of lower degrees .",
    "one would like to prove the following .",
    "if a homogeneous polynomial potential of degree @xmath514 admits an additional polynomial first integral , then it admits an additional first integral of degree at most two with respect to the momenta .",
    "let us consider a restricted version of this conjecture .",
    "namely , let us assume that we consider only a generic potential of degree @xmath515 .",
    "such potential has exactly @xmath109 proper darboux points , for each @xmath109 we know two elements of its distinguished spectrum @xmath448 , namely @xmath516 let us assume that for an arbitrary @xmath515 set @xmath448 has only these two elements",
    ". then we can prove the restricted version of the conjecture showing that the only potential with spectrum @xmath517 is the potential separable in the cartesian coordinates , and the only potential with spectrum @xmath518 is a potential separable in parabolic coordinates .",
    "unfortunately , the assumption about the number of elements of the set @xmath448 is true only for @xmath519 . for @xmath520 ,",
    "set @xmath448 contains two additional elements @xmath521 then , additional elements of @xmath448 appear for @xmath522 , and it seems that there is no upper bound for these exceptional values of @xmath109 .",
    "the presented method can be applied effectively only for small values of @xmath61 and @xmath109 . with the known computational algorithms for determination of distinguished spectra and reconstruction of potential",
    ", it seems that limiting values are @xmath523 and @xmath524 .",
    "we believe that a substantial progress in this field will be possible after development of the higher order variational equations techniques .",
