    "charmonium history began in @xmath10 with the discovery of the so - called @xmath1 particle . soon after that",
    ", it was realized that @xmath1 could be described as a bound state of a charm quark and a charm antiquark , namely as a two - body problem . moreover , owing to the large mass of the charm quark , the system could be considered in a first place by its nonrelativistic nature and thus solving the schrdinger equation with a well motivated qcd potential was a successful approach to the problem at hand .",
    "the discovery in @xmath11 of the @xmath2 resonance made evident that the naive quark model picture is not enough to describe its properties .",
    "for instance , the large mass of the @xmath2 and its zero isospin value point out that it is made by charm quarks ; on the other hand , the isospin violating decay @xmath12 makes the @xmath2 difficult to accommodate as charm - anticharm state .",
    "however , the decay mentioned above can be naturally explained in a picture in which the @xmath2 is understood as a @xmath13 bound state , namely a four - quark bound - state problem .    during the last decade ,",
    "experimental observations have revealed the existence of a large number of unexpected states such as the @xmath2 , culminating recently with the observation by the lhcb collaboration in @xmath14 of two charmonium pentaquark states @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have gone from a two - body problem to a five - body problem passing trough a four - body one in less than 15 years .    in this proceedings contribution",
    "we present a unified description of all these states within the framework of a constituent model of quarks .",
    "the model has already been applied to two- and four - quark structures and is now being applied to the study of five - quark states .",
    "in addition , we discuss herein a set of four resonances recently measured in the lhcb  @xcite : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which have been considered as new multiquark states  @xcite but in our scheme most of them appear as simple quark - antiquark structures .",
    "our constituent quark model ( cqm ) is based on the assumption that the light massless light quark acquires a dynamical , momentum dependent mass namely the constituent quark mass as a consequence of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking of the qcd lagrangian at some momentum scale .",
    "this constituent quark mass is frozen at low momenta at a value around @xmath15 and explains the @xmath16 of the mass of the proton .",
    "the simplest lagrangian which mimics this situation must contain chiral fields to compensate the constituent mass term .",
    "these chiral fields induce boson exchanges between quarks . in the heavy quark sector ,",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and we do not need additional fields . however , the chiral fields introduced above provide a natural way to incorporate one - pion ( ope ) interactions in the molecular ( four - quark ) dynamics .",
    "higher pion exchanges than ope are effectively included by scalar boson exchanges .    besides the dynamically broken chiral symmetry ,",
    "the other two main properties of qcd that are incorporated in our quark model are confinement and asymptotic freedom . to mimic such features we use a linear screened confining potential and a perturbative one - gluon exchange interaction .",
    "the detailed explanation and parametrization of all these interactions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , updated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to obtain the solutions in the two - body case , we solve the schrdinger equation using the gaussian expansion method  @xcite whereas the four and five - body problem are solved using the resonating group method  @xcite .",
    "two - quark and multiquark configurations are coupled using the @xmath17 method  @xcite .",
    "details of the calculations are given in refs .",
    "@xcite    [ t1 ]    cccccc molecule & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 ( mev ) & @xmath21 ( mev ) & @xmath22 ( mev ) + @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 + @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath25 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 + @xmath29 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 + @xmath29 & @xmath37 & @xmath25 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 +",
    "we consider the @xmath41 and @xmath42 thresholds which are the only ones close to the mass of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances and also where a sizable residual interaction mainly due to pion exchanges can be expected .",
    "one can see in table  [ t1 ] that in the mass region of the @xmath3 we obtain a @xmath41 bound state with @xmath43 .",
    "its mass is very close to the experimental one and should , in principle , be identified with the observed @xmath3 structure .    referring to the channel @xmath42 , we find three almost degenerated states with a mass around @xmath44 that makes them natural candidates for the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the total spin and parity of these states are @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". their degeneration may be the origin of the uncertainty in the experimental determination of the total spin and parity for the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "it is remarkable that the three bound states predicted by our model decay into @xmath48 final state with a partial decay width which is generally equal to or larger than the width corresponding to the @xmath49 decay channel .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath50 final state is a suitable decay channel for studying the properties of these resonances .",
    "in particular , the width of the predicted @xmath29 resonance with @xmath45 is twelve times larger through the @xmath51 channel than through the @xmath49 channel , making this decay an important check of our prediction .",
    "concerning the parity of the states , a molecular scenario is not the most convenient to obtain positive parity states because , being the @xmath52 mesons and the @xmath53 baryons of opposite parity , the relative angular momentum should be at least @xmath54 ( p - wave ) which will be above s - waves .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the states with positive parity in table  [ t1 ] are those with smaller binding energies .",

    "it can be seen that the naive quark model is able to reproduce all the new lhcb resonances except the @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 appear as conventional charmonium states with quantum numbers @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "a complete study of the decay widths of these states has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite showing that the total decay width of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , withing errors , in reasonable agreement with the data .    to gain some insight into the nature of the @xmath5 ,",
    "that does not appear as a quark - antiquark state , and to see how the coupling with the open - flavour thresholds can modify the properties of the naive quark - antiquark states predicted above , we have performed a coupled - channel calculation including the @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 channels for the @xmath94 sector ; and the @xmath102 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 ones for the @xmath103 sector .",
    "these are the allowed channels whose thresholds are in the region studied by the lhcb .",
    "our results for the @xmath94 channel can be found in ref .",
    "therein , we conclude first that the net effect of coupling the thresholds to both naive quark - antiquark states is to modify the mass of the bare @xmath0 states in a modest amount .",
    "the second observation is that the total decay widths are significantly reduced .    for the coupled - channel calculation in the @xmath103 channel",
    ", we found only one state with mass @xmath104 and total decay width @xmath105 .",
    "this state is made by @xmath106 of the @xmath59 charmonium state and by @xmath107 of the @xmath102 component .",
    "our theoretical results are given in tables  [ tab : r3 ] and  [ tab : r4 ] .",
    "as we do not find any signal for the @xmath5 , neither bound nor virtual , we analyze the line shape of the @xmath101 channel as an attempt to explain the @xmath5 as a simple threshold cusp ( see again ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2 ] compares our result with that reported by the lhcb collaboration in the @xmath108 decays .",
    "the rapid increase observed in the data near the @xmath101 threshold corresponds to a bump in the theoretical result just above such threshold .",
    "this cusp is too wide to be produced by a bound or virtual state below the @xmath101 threshold .",
    "as a summary , our results confirm the fact that there are several states with a @xmath109 structure in the vicinity of the masses of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 pentaquarks reported by the lhcb .    concerning the other resonances , three of them , namely @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are consistent with bare quark - antiquark states with quantum numbers @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .    in the @xmath69 sector , we do not find any pole in the mass region of the @xmath5 .",
    "however , the scattering amplitude shows a bump just above the @xmath101 threshold which reproduces the fast increase of the experimental data .",
    "therefore , the structure showed by this data around @xmath113 should be interpreted as a cusp due to the presence of the @xmath102 threshold .",
