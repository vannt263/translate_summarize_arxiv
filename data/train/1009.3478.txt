    "@xmath2 is the set of holomorphic conjugacy classes of quadratic rational maps with a critical point of period @xmath3 . for example , @xmath4 may be identified with the family of quadratic polynomials @xmath5 each map having @xmath6 as a fixed critical point .",
    "the dynamics of the maps in @xmath4 are encoded by the much studied mandelbrot set ( see e.g. [ bm],[m],[dh ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 can be taken as the family of functions @xmath8 ( along with the function @xmath9 ) , each map having the critical 2-cycle @xmath10 in [ t ] , timorin has given a detailed description of the dynamical plane of @xmath7 . in the case of @xmath11 , one can take @xmath2 to be the set of @xmath12 such that for the quadratic map @xmath13 the critical point @xmath14 has period @xmath3 ( see e.g. [ r3 ] ) .",
    "so , for @xmath11 , any map @xmath15 in @xmath2 has the critical cycle @xmath16    @xmath17 may be written in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 $ ] are polynomials having no common factors .",
    "the closure of @xmath2 ( in @xmath20 ) is a complex algebraic curve supported on @xmath21 .",
    "for example , since @xmath22 , @xmath23 identifies with the complex line @xmath24    for @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 so @xmath27 is contained in the zero set of the irreducible conic @xmath28    now , for @xmath29 , the projective closure of @xmath2 , which we will denote by @xmath30 , is birational to @xmath31 however , as is proved in stimson s thesis [ st ] , and as we will demonstrate in section 5 , the geometric genus of @xmath32 is 1 , i.e. @xmath32 is birational to a torus . in [ st ]",
    "it is also shown that @xmath33 and conjectured that @xmath34 ( with the irreducibility of @xmath35 left unfinished ) .",
    "this means that in these higher period cases , we no longer have a parametrization of @xmath2 by @xmath36 .",
    "a rational map @xmath37 is hyperbolic if under iteration , each critical point of @xmath15 is attracted to some attracting periodic cycle .",
    "hyperbolic maps are an open and ( conjecturally ) dense set in the space of rational maps ( see e.g. [ mss ] ) .",
    "connected components of the set of hyperbolic maps are called hyperbolic components . over the past several decades",
    ", much progress has been made in describing the hyperbolic components of the @xmath2 s - especially for @xmath38 ( see e.g. [ r1 - 3],[w],[t ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we will describe an algorithm to draw the hyperbolic components of @xmath2 while distinguishing between types of components .",
    "our algorithm is essentially an implementation of the classification of hyperbolic components for rational maps ( see e.g. [ r1 - 3 ] ) .",
    "we then use this algorithm to generate graphical approximations of the components of @xmath2 for the cases for which we have a parametrization ( the genus 0 cases of @xmath0 ) . of course @xmath39",
    "have been drawn before ( see e.g. [ bm],[t],[w ] ) , but we have included images of these parameter spaces for the reader s convenience ( see figs .",
    "2,3 , and 4 ) .",
    "our graphical approximations of @xmath27 are shown in figs .",
    "5,6 , and 7 .",
    "recently , kiwi and rees ( [ kr ] ) have found fomulas to count the number of hyperbolic components in @xmath2 .",
    "their results confirm the number of components illustrated in our figures .    to complete the paper ,",
    "we give an additional proof that the genus of @xmath1 is 1 ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "we do our genus calculation for @xmath1 by resolving singularities by blowups , whereas the original proof in [ st ] uses puiseaux expansions .",
    "this additional proof has been included for 2 reasons .",
    "the first reason being completeness of this paper - the result explains why we are not able to generate graphics for @xmath1 .",
    "the second reason being that the authors hope that a resolution by blowups may shed light on a general genus computation for @xmath2 . during the preparation of this paper , the second author and two undergraduate students performed a similar calculation for @xmath40 .",
    "the blowup sequences for @xmath40 may be found in [ dhj ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we recall the classification of hyperbolic quadratic rational maps with a critical cycle .",
    "we then explain how this classification gives an algorithm for approximating the hyperbolic components of @xmath2 , while distinguishing between their types . in section 3",
    "we illustrate some computer generated representations of the hyperbolic components of @xmath2 for @xmath41 .",
    "section 4 contains our calculation of the genus of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , section 5 describes the computer program we made to produce the graphics in this paper .",
    "the second author would like to thank mary rees for providing some helpful comments and pointing out some useful references during the preparation of this paper .",
    "since quadratic maps have 2 critical points and any map @xmath15 in @xmath2 has the critical cycle @xmath42 we shall refer to the one remaining critical point of @xmath15 as the free critical point .",
    "hyperbolic rational maps have been classified by their critical orbits ( see e.g. [ r1 - 3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , any hyperbolic map @xmath15 in @xmath2 must be exactly one of the following four types :    * type 1 * the free critical point is attracted to the other critical point , which is a fixed point .    * type 2 * the free critical point is in a periodic component of the attracting basin of the critical cycle .",
    "* type 3 * the free critical point is in a preperiodic component of the attracting basin of the critical cycle .",
    "* type 4 * the free critical point belongs to the attracting basin of a periodic orbit other than the critical cycle .",
    "this classification suggests an algorithm for making an approximation of the hyperbolic components of @xmath2 .",
    "note that it is easy to distinguish type 4 mappings from the other types by testing the orbit of the free critical point for attraction to the critical cycle . also , if @xmath43 then @xmath2 has no type 1 maps , and if @xmath44 then @xmath2 has no maps of types 2 or 3 .",
    "so the case of @xmath44 is easy ; and , for @xmath43 we just need to distinguish between type 2 and type 3 maps . to do this",
    ", one must decide if there is a path from the free critical point to the attracting periodic point , entirely contained within the immediate attracting basin . for most type 2 maps in @xmath2 , the line segment between the free critical point and",
    "its attractor lies within the immediate basin",
    ". however , there are type 2 maps in @xmath23 and @xmath27 for which a nonlinear path must be found ( see figs . 1,7 , and 9 ) .",
    "we solved this problem by flood - filling the immediate attracting basin to test for the free critical point .     where @xmath45 . the free critical point is attracted to 1 under iteration of @xmath46 in this case ; but , as is illustrated , the line segment joining the free critical point and 1 is not entirely contained in the immediate basin .",
    "the image on the right shows a similar situation for a map in @xmath27 . ]",
    "using the above algorithm ( and a parametrization for @xmath2 ) , we can generate a graphical approximation of the hyperbolic components of @xmath2 - distinguishing between types . in this section",
    "we illustrate such approximations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "approximations of the hyperbolic components of @xmath49 and @xmath23 have previously been illustrated ( see e.g. [ b - m],[m ] , and [ w ] ) .",
    "however , these approximations ( at least for @xmath7 and @xmath23 ) do not give a graphical distinction between the types of components .",
    "so we will include these parameter spaces for the reader s convenience .",
    "next we will provide some representations of @xmath27 .",
    "* @xmath4 : * the set of holomorphic conjugacy classes of quadratic rational maps with a fixed critical point may be identified with the family of polynomials @xmath50 there are no type ii or iii components in this case .",
    "the complement of the single type i component is the classical mandelbrot set ( see fig .",
    "the single type 1 component is in white .",
    "since @xmath6 is a fixed critical point there are no maps of types 2 or 3 . the free critical point , for the maps colored in black , is not attracted to @xmath6 .",
    "]    * @xmath7 : * the set of holomorphic conjugacy classes of quadratic rational maps with a period 2 critical point may be identified with the rational map @xmath51 together with the family @xmath52    @xmath7 contains one type 2 component ( see fig .",

    ": the image on the left shows the maps whose free critical point is attracted to @xmath6 in red , while the maps with attraction to 0 are colored green .",

    "compare with figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "it is a classical result that any singular point @xmath64 on an algebraic curve @xmath65 may be resolved by a sequence of blowups ( see e.g. [ s ] or [ c ] ) .",
    "the point @xmath64 and the singular points arising from these blowups are called the infinitely near points to @xmath64 .    to calculate the geometric genus of an irreducible complex projective plane algebraic curve @xmath66 one may use the genus formula :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the degree of @xmath65 and the @xmath69 s are the multiplicities of all the infinitely near points to the singularities of @xmath65 ( see e.g. [ s ] ) .",
    "geometrically , blowing - up a point consists of replacing the point by a line of tangent directions .",
    "algebraically , the blowup of a point in affine space @xmath70 is described as follows :    after suitable change of coordinates one may arrange that the point to blowup is the origin @xmath71 . in this case , setting    @xmath72    the birational map @xmath73 given by @xmath74 is called the blowup of @xmath75 centered at the origin .    for more information on plane curves , singularities , and",
