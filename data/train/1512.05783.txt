    "more than 180 molecules have been detected in the interstellar medium and circumstellar shells of evolved stars , and approximately 40% of them are classified into carbon - chain molecules .",
    "it is therefore of fundamental importance for astrochemistry to study their formation processes .",
    "however , these molecules are so reactive due to unsaturated chemical bonds and/or unpaired electrons that laboratory measurements of their reaction rates are not routine experiments . although formation mechanisms of the carbon - chain molecules have mainly been studied by chemical model calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is still difficult to reproduce molecular abundances derived by observations , and to determine formation mechanisms of carbon - chain molecules , because of uncertain rate coefficients and of poor knowledge of elementary reactions involving carbon - chain molecules .",
    "another method to study major formation pathways of molecules is based mainly on observations .",
    "recent developments of radio astronomical instruments allow us to detect low - abundance species , including rare isotopologues , with a reasonable observation time . formation mechanisms of some representative carbon - chain molecules have been investigated by observing their @xmath2c isotopic fractionation , such as hc@xmath12n @xcite , cch @xcite , ccs @xcite , c@xmath12s , and c@xmath13h @xcite , toward the cyanopolyyne peak in taurus molecular cloud-1 ( tmc-1 cp ; @xmath14 pc ) , and _ cyclic_-c@xmath12h@xmath15 @xcite toward the low - mass star - forming region l1527 .",
    "tmc-1 cp is a representative cold dark cloud where various carbon - chain molecules are abundant .",
    "for instance , @xcite carried out spectral line survey observations in the @xmath16 ghz region toward tmc-1 cp with the 45-m radio telescope of nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) , and demonstrated that this source is rich in carbon - chain molecules .",
    "cyanoacetylene , hc@xmath12n , is a very abundant carbon - chain molecule in tmc-1 cp .",
    "@xcite observed three @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath12n toward tmc-1 cp , and the relative abundance of hcc@xmath2cn is significantly higher than that of the other isotopologues : @xmath7h@xmath2cccn@xmath8 : [ $ ] hc@xmath2ccn@xmath8 : [ $ ] hcc@xmath2cn@xmath8 $ ] is @xmath17 .",
    "these results imply that hc@xmath12n is mainly formed by the reaction between a hydrocarbon molecule with two equivalent carbon atoms and a molecule with one carbon atom , whose @xmath10c/@xmath2c ratios are different from each other . according to _ ab initio _ calculations , the reaction of c@xmath15h@xmath15 + cn is exothermic , and has no significant energy barrier @xcite .",

    ", @xcite suggested that hc@xmath12n is formed by the reaction between c@xmath15h@xmath15 and cn .",
    "it can naturally be predicted that hc@xmath3n is formed by the similar mechanism of hc@xmath12n , the reaction of c@xmath13h@xmath15 + cn .",
    "@xcite conducted _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on the reactions of c@xmath21h@xmath15 + cn ( @xmath22 ) , which form hc@xmath23n , and found that these reactions are all exothermic and have no energy barriers .",

    "these results suggest that hc@xmath3n can be formed by the reaction of c@xmath13h@xmath15 + cn .",
    "if so , we would be able to observe different abundances of the five @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath3n .",
    "observations of the @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath3n were carried out toward tmc-1 cp by @xcite .",
    "although they detected the five @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath3n , they could not determine well their relative abundances due to low signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "@xcite also reported the spectra of the two @xmath2c isotopologues , hc@xmath2ccccn and hcccc@xmath2cn , with slightly higher signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , they could not discuss its main formation pathway , because of the lack of data for the other three @xmath2c isotopologues .    in the present paper",
    ", we observed the five @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath3n toward tmc-1 cp with the nro 45-m telescope with high enough signal - to - noise ratios to constrain mechanisms responsible for the formation of hc@xmath3n .",
    "we carried out observations of the normal species and the five @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath3n with the nro 45-m radio telescope in 2014 march , april ( 2013 - 2014 season ) , december , and 2015 january ( 2014 - 2015 season ) .",
    "the observed position was ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) = ( 04@xmath3141@xmath324249 , 2541270 ) for tmc-1 cp .",
    "the z45 receiver @xcite and the high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifier receiver ( h22 ) , both of which can obtain dual - polarization data simultaneously , were used for the observations of the _ j _ = @xmath1 and _ j _ = @xmath0 transitions at 42 ghz and 23 ghz , respectively .",
    "the exact frequencies of the observed lines are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the system temperatures of the z45 and the h22 receivers were from 100 to 130 k , and from 90 to 110 k , respectively .",
    "the beam sizes and the main beam efficiencies ( @xmath33 ) were 37 `` and 0.72 for 42 ghz @xcite , and 72 '' and 0.8 for 23 ghz .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 1.5 hours by observing the sio maser line ( _ j _ = 1 - 0 ) from nml tau and gl 5134 , and the pointing error was less than 3 \" .",
    "we used the sam45 fx - type digital correlator in frequency settings whose bandwidths and resolutions are 125 mhz and 30.52 khz , respectively , for observations at 42 ghz , and 63 mhz and 15.26 khz , respectively , for those at 23 ghz .",
    "these frequency resolutions correspond to the velocity resolution of about 0.2 km s@xmath20 .",
    "we employed the position - switching mode , where the off - source position was set to be + 30 away in the right ascension .",
    "the smoothed bandpass calibration method @xcite was adopted in the analysis , which allows us to greatly improve the signal - to - noise ratios , compared with the standard position - switch observations .",
    "in fact , the scan pattern of this method was a set of 20 seconds and 5 seconds for on - source and off - source positions , respectively .",
    "we applied 60 and 32 channel - smoothing for the off - source spectra at 23 ghz and 42 ghz , respectively .",
    "the spectra of the five @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath3n were taken with signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath34 , as shown in figures [ fig1 ] .",
    "we also obtained high quality data for the normal species . since the spectra show a symmetric single peak structure , we fitted the spectra with a gaussian profile , and obtained the spectral line parameters , as summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the line widths ( @xmath35 [ km s@xmath20 ] ) in the 23 ghz region ( @xmath37 km s@xmath20 ) are broader than those in the 42 ghz region ( @xmath38 km s@xmath20 ) .",
    "although the origin of their difference is unclear , the following possibility can be considered .",
    "it is well known that the tmc-1 cp region has a complex velocity structure @xcite . since the telescope beam samples a wider area at 23 ghz than at 42 ghz",
    ", the line width could be larger at 23 ghz .",
    "however , this difference does not affect our discussion on the relative abundance ratios among the five @xmath2c isotopologues seriously , and hence , we do not discuss the line width further .",
    "the values of _",
    "v_@xmath39 are consistent with one another , and are in good agreement with the _ v_@xmath39 value reported for this source ( 5.85 km s@xmath20 , @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of the integrated intensities ( @xmath40 [ k km s@xmath20 ] ) of the five @xmath2c isotopologues is derived to be @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) ( 1@xmath6 ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath5 ) ( 1@xmath6 ) for @xmath7h@xmath2cccccn@xmath8 : [ $ ] hc@xmath2ccccn@xmath8 : [ $ ] hcc@xmath2cccn@xmath8 : [ $ ] hccc@xmath2ccn@xmath8 : [ $ ] hcccc@xmath2cn@xmath8 $ ] for the _ j _ = @xmath0 and _ j _ = @xmath1 lines , respectively .",

    "however , @xcite showed that the observed brightness temperatures of the hc@xmath3n lines are well approximated by the rotation temperature of 6.5 k. then , we calculated the column densities of the normal species and the five @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath3n using the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) as shown the following formulae @xcite :    @xmath46,\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 in equation ( [ tau ] ) , @xmath49 denotes the antenna temperature , _ f _ the beam filling factor , @xmath50 the main beam efficiency ( see section [ obs ] ) , and @xmath51 the optical depth . we used 0.8 and 1 for _ f _ in the 23 ghz and 42 ghz band data , respectively .",

    "the obtained excitation temperature and column density of the normal species are consistent with the previous result ( @xmath60 k and ( @xmath66)@xmath62 @xmath63 ) @xcite within the error ranges .",
    "we calculated the column densities of the five @xmath2c isotopologues using equation ( [ col ] ) and the excitation temperature derived for the normal species ( 6.5 k ) .",

    "these results are consistent with the value obtained from the normal species ( 6.5 k ) within the errors , which implies that we can neglect the effect of self - trapping for the normal species .",

    "we here consider possible reactions leading to cyanopolyynes , using the umist database for astrochemistry 2012 @xcite . by focusing on the rate constants , activation energies , abundances and formation pathways of precursors",
    ", we can sketch formation pathways of cyanopolyynes , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "three types of formation pathways are possible as follows : + pathway 1 : the reactions of c@xmath21h@xmath15 + cn , + pathway 2 : the growth of the cyanopolyyne carbon chains via c@xmath15h@xmath15@xmath79 + hc@xmath23n , and + pathway 3 : the reactions between hydrocarbon ions and nitrogen atoms followed by electron recombination reactions .    for hc@xmath12n , pathway 1 is suggested to play a dominant role in its production : @xcite reported that the main formation pathway of hc@xmath12n is the reaction of c@xmath15h@xmath15 + cn on the basis of their observational results of @xmath2c isotopic fractionation .",
    "fractionation of @xmath2c in cn proceeds through the following reaction @xcite : @xmath80 this reaction is exothermic with energy of 34 k due to decreasing the zero - point vibrational energy .",
    "hence , its backward reaction is not effective in cold dark clouds , where the typical temperature is approximately 10 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the @xmath10c/@xmath2c ratio for cn decreases in comparison with those for hydrocarbons such as c@xmath15h@xmath15 and c@xmath13h@xmath15 , because similar fractionation processes of @xmath2c do not occur in hydrocarbons @xcite .    if hc@xmath3n is mainly formed by pathways 1 and/or 2 , at least one carbon atom in hc@xmath3n , possibly that adjacent to the nitrogen atom , is not equivalent to the others . assuming that hc@xmath3n is mainly formed by pathway 2 ,",

    "however , our observed abundances are roughly equal for all the @xmath2c isotopologues .",
    "it is not likely that pathway 1 and 2 are the main formation pathways of hc@xmath3n .    on the basis of the above consideration",
    ", we propose that pathway 3 should significantly contribute to formation of hc@xmath3n . in pathway 3 , all carbon atoms in hc@xmath3n originate from the hydrocarbon ions . if all the carbon atoms in the mother hydrocarbon ion have the similar @xmath10c/@xmath2c ratio , the observational result can be explained .",
    "this seems indeed possible for a large hydrocarbon ion , because it is generally produced through various processes .",
    "this pathway is similar to the chemical model calculation by @xcite , where hc@xmath3n can be produced through the reaction between a hydrocarbon ion ( c@xmath3h@xmath12@xmath79 ) and a nitrogen atom .",
    "thus , we propose that pathway 3 overwhelms pathways 1 and 2 , resulting in almost equivalent abundances of the @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath3n .    based on the above discussion on hc@xmath3n",
    ", we also propose that the longer cyanopolyynes may be formed by a mechanism similar to that of hc@xmath3n , namely the reactions between hydrocarbon ions and nitrogen atoms .",
    "however , it is difficult to confirm our suggestion by observations of @xmath2c isotopic fractionation at the present . @xcite",
    "tentatively detected the @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath84n using the _ j _ = @xmath85 and @xmath86 transitions for the first time in the interstellar medium .",
    "they calculated the averaged @xmath10c/@xmath2c ratio of hc@xmath84n , but they could not study its @xmath2c isotopic fractionation as they only derived upper limits for each of the seven @xmath2c isotopologues . hence , more sensitive observations are needed to confirm the flat @xmath2c abundance over the seven @xmath2c isotopologues of hc@xmath84n . in the theoretical model by @xcite , the pathways leading to hc@xmath84n and hc@xmath87n via reactions between hydrocarbon ions ( c@xmath84h@xmath12@xmath79 and c@xmath87h@xmath12@xmath79 , respectively ) and nitrogen atoms followed by the electron recombination reactions are presented . the most interesting point to emerge from our analysis",
    "is that cyanopolyynes longer than hc@xmath3n are mainly produced by the reactions between hydrocarbon ions and nitrogen atoms , whereas hc@xmath12n is mainly produced by the neutral - neutral reaction between c@xmath15h@xmath15 and cn .",
    "one possible reason is high abundance of c@xmath15h@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we compile @xmath10c/@xmath2c ratios of some carbon - chain molecules at tmc-1 cp in table [ tab3 ]",

    "for example , for hc@xmath12n and hc@xmath3n , the @xmath10c/@xmath2c ratios coincide among their @xmath2c isotopologues within about 20% and 10% , respectively . on the other hand , for ccs",

    "an interesting characteristic of the @xmath10c/@xmath2c ratios of the two cyanopolyynes is that their differences appear to be small among the @xmath2c isotopologues of each cyanopolyyne , compared to other carbon - chain molecules .",
