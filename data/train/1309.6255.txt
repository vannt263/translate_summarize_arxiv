    "experimental reports , starting in the sixties @xcite , of substantial enhancement of superconductivity in thin granular films of different materials have been a continuous stimulus to study superconductivity in low dimensions .",
    "however the dramatic increase of the critical temperature observed in materials like al or sn @xcite resisted a conclusive theoretical explanation .",
    "the cause of the enhancement was related to surface phonons , fluctuations of the spectral density around the fermi energy or shape resonances @xcite .",
    "the first two proposals could not be reconciled with the fact that the enhancement was observed on some materials but not in others .",
    "the latter mechanism , put forward by blatt and thompson @xcite , is only effective for clean thin films with only a few mono - layers thick .",
    "however the samples were granular and disordered . indeed more refined experimental studies @xcite where thin films were smoother and granularity was attenuated showed no substantial enhancement of superconductivity . in the context of single nanograins , the seminal experiments of tinkham and coworkers @xcite on single nanoscale al grains provided evidence that some sort of superconductivity is still present in grains of only a few nanometer size where the mean level spacing is comparable with the energy gap @xcite . for larger clean grains , but still within the nanoscale region , numerical solutions of the the bardeen - cooper - schrieber ( bcs ) gap equation @xcite and boguliubov de gennes equations @xcite showed that the critical temperature and other superconducting properties were highly non - monotonic as a function of the system size with peaks well above the bulk limit .",
    "explicit results were obtained for a variety of shapes and confining potentials : cubes @xcite , spheres @xcite , cylinders @xcite and harmonic confining potentials @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the peaks , namely , the enhancement of superconductivity , was larger in spherical and cubic grains than in chaotic grains @xcite with no symmetry .",
    "moreover , for a fixed size , deviations from the bulk limit are more pronounced as the superconducting coherence length of the material increases .",
    "analytical results @xcite based on the periodic orbit theory @xcite indicate that the reason for these non - monotonic deviations from the bulk limit was associated to shell effects , namely , level degeneracy in the proximities of the fermi energy due to the geometrical symmetries of the grain .",
    "a larger spectral density induces an effective stronger binding of cooper s pairs that boost superconductivity .",
    "recent experiments on single isolated hemispherical sn grains @xcite have reported , in full agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite , large oscillations in the size dependence of the energy gap in the region @xmath1 nm . however some puzzles still remain .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it was also observed a substantial ( @xmath2 ) monotonic enhancement of the superconducting gap up to the largest grains @xmath3 nm studied that can not be explained by shell effects or surface phonons .",
    "( a ) the mean superconducting gap as a function of the hemispherical grain size for @xmath4 al ( dotted line),@xmath5 sn ( dashed line ) , @xmath6 pb ( solid line ) .",
    "( b ) comparison between the experimental results ( solid line ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for sn hemispherical nanograins and the theoretical prediction ( dashed line ) eq.([gapsup ] ) that includes the effect of inhomogeneous pairing .",
    "we have averaged fluctuations in order to single out the contribution not related to shell effects in the spectral density .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to the bulk behaviour . ]    here we provide evidence that this monotonic enhancement is caused by spatial fluctuations in the density of probability of cooper s pairs in a confined geometry .",
    "we carry out a numerical calculation , within a mean - field framework , of the order parameter in a hemispherical grain for sizes up to @xmath7 nm . our results , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which are parameter free , are in fair agreement with recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "this additional enhancement stems from the fact that , in finite size grains , the interactions that bind the electron into a cooper s pair depend on the quantum numbers of the one - body problem eigenstates .",
    "the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath8 becomes inhomogeneous as it depends on these quantum numbers , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the grain volume , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the eigenstate of the one body problem and @xmath13 the set of quantum numbers that labels the state . for the case of grains with no symmetry , the leading finite size correction due to this effect ref .",
    "@xcite is positive @xmath14 with @xmath15 that depends on boundary conditions . for a chaotic grain",
    "the semiclassical analytical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that this the leading correction for sizes @xmath16 nm .",
    "the superconducting grain is described by the bcs hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 creates an electron of spin @xmath19 in a state with quantum numbers @xmath20 and energy @xmath21 , @xmath8 is the dimensionless bcs coupling constant for the material , @xmath22 is the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "the electron - electron interaction matrix elements resulting from a contact interaction is given by , @xmath23 where @xmath10 is the volume of the grain and @xmath24 is single - electron eigenfunction in state @xmath25 .",
    "+ the superconducting gap is calculated from the self - consistency equation , @xmath26 where the sum is now taken over all states @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the debye energy .",
    "we note that @xcite that this approach leads to results similar to those obtained from the technically more involved bogoliubov de gennes equations . in the bulk limit",
    "eigenfunctions are plane waves and the matrix elements are simply @xmath29 however in small grains eigenstates of the one body problem are not plane waves so we expect deviations in @xmath30 from the bulk limit .",
    "we restrict our interest to grains such that @xmath31 where a bcs mean field approach is valid . to make direct comparison with experimental results we calculate numerically @xmath30 for hemispherical grains of radius @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the experimental grains @xcite are not exactly hemispherical but closer to a spherical cap of height @xmath33 .",
    "although the non - monotonic oscillations due to shell effects depend strongly on the shape of the grains we expect that the monotonic deviations that we aim to describe are less sensitive to this relatively small shape difference .",
    "therefore the eigenfunctions entering in the matrix element above are those of a single electron in a spherical grain of radius @xmath32 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the normalisation constant , @xmath36 are the spherical bessel functions of the first kind , @xmath37 is the @xmath38 zero of the @xmath39 spherical bessel function and @xmath40 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "the energy associated with these eigenstates is , @xmath41 .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions on the hemispherical surface @xcite restricts @xmath42 to be odd .",
    "the final expression for the matrix elements is simplified by using clebsch - gordan coefficients , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is summed over all possible values in the range , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the superconducting gap can then be written as , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the average of @xmath52 over all states in the interacting region @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the level closest to the fermi - energy .",
    "this should be a good approximation for sufficiently large grains for which the matrix elements do not depend strongly on the quantum numbers .",
    "this is also consistent with the observation that in scanning tunnelling microscope experiments @xcite the value of the gap did not depend much on the exact position of the tip .",
    "moreover it was found in @xcite that a similar simplified expression for the gap describes shell effects related to fluctuations of the spectral density . in that case the resulting spectral density after solving the gap equation is expressed as a finite sum over classical periodic orbits of length less than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath55 .",
    "this value is consistent with the sn bulk gap @xmath56mev and a debye energy @xmath57mev .",
    "the numerical results , see fig [ fig1 ] , show substantial deviations from the bulk even at large grain sizes .",
    "the theoretical prediction is strikingly similar to the experimental observation .",
    "we stress that the theoretical expression is parameter fee .",
    "results for other materials , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are similar . from eq .",
    "( [ gapsup ] ) it is clear that finite size effects are stronger the smaller is the coupling constant @xmath8 . in more physical terms ,",
    "finite size effects are stronger in materials with a long superconducting coherence length @xmath58 .",
    "a few final comments are in order : a ) shell effects that induce oscillations in the spectral density have been averaged out in order to single out monotonic deviations from the bulk limit , b ) the dip at @xmath59 nm in the theoretical prediction is likely a consequence of statistical fluctuations related to the relatively small number of points employed in the averaging of gap size oscillations , c ) deviations for smaller sizes @xmath60 nm are likely due to the difference between the spherical cap shape of the experimental grains and the exact hemispherical shape employed in the theoretical calculation .    in conclusion we have investigated superconductivity in hemispherical nano - grains of metallic superconductors .",
    "deviations from the bulk are clearly observed even for the largest grains @xmath0 nm .",
    "experimental results @xcite in single isolated sn nanograins are in full agreement with the analytical predictions .",
    "similar results are expected in other weakly coupled superconducting materials .",
