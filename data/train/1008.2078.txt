    "the concept of `` resonance '' is ubiquitous in physics but it is not always sharply or uniquely defined .",
    "the definition of a resonance in quantum scattering systems , for example , has been subject of endless debates among supporters of complex plane poles , of a phase shift jump , or of other criteria .",
    "typically a resonance implies variations of different characteristic properties with respect to one parameter within the resonance width , but the extremal points for the different properties do not necessarily coincide ; it may even be the case that the variation of a property is completely missing , and the extrema for several of them may be shifted with respect to each other , which could lead to noticeable errors if the criterion chosen for selecting the parameter value is not the most appropriate .",
    "resonances appear in summary as multifaceted phenomena , and a full characterization of their various aspects is important to control and optimize specific effects .    in a recent publication @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the definition of a resonance in quantum systems with discrete energy levels , in particular those resonances associated with avoided crossings .",
    "the crossing / avoided crossing scenario is quite common in many fields of nuclear , atomic , or molecular physics such as laser driven trapped ions @xcite , two level atoms coupled to a cavity mode @xcite , or diamagnetic hydrogen in magnetic fields @xcite . in the avoided crossing regions , two eigenvalues of the system approach as a parameter of the system @xmath2",
    "is varied but then veer from each other . for a zeroth order hamiltonian defining the bare levels , the levels do cross at a reference value @xmath3 , but a perturbation connecting them causes the splitting .",
    "the eigenvalues also interchange their character so that , in a continuous adiabatic passage following one of the eigenvalues through the region , the system suffers a significant transformation , being dominated by different bare levels on both sides of the crossing .",
    "the resonance is also characterized by maximal oscillations for transition probabilities among the bare levels .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , the parameter values of minimal splitting and of maximal transition probability do not coincide in general , defining in this way different , structural and dynamical aspects of the resonance .    in this paper , we propose a simple physical setting , a 3-level system subjected to a 2-photon transition , where this phenomenon may be observed . in sec .",

    "the most obvious setting for a raman - transition experiment is driving optical stimulated raman transitions in alkali atoms . unfortunately , this appears to be a difficult scenario in which to study this effect .",
    "taking @xmath81rb as an example , for driving stimulated raman transitions between hyperfine ground levels , using lasers nearly resonant with the d@xmath82 line ( @xmath83 transition ) , typical parameters are a detuning @xmath84  ghz and rabi frequencies @xmath85  mhz .",
    "these parameters give a lowest - order dynamical shift [ eq .",
    "( [ dyn_shift_approx ] ) ] of 400  hz",
    ". however , with an excited - state decay rate of @xmath86  mhz , the rate of spontaneous scattering from the raman fields is around @xmath87 , or about 3.8  khz .",
    "the problem here is that the dressed states will be broadened at the khz level , and the interaction time of the probe will be limited , so that the the resolution of the probe will be too poor to resolve the dynamical shift . decreasing the scattering rate also does not help much ; for example , increasing the detuning to @xmath88  ghz leads to a scattering rate of only 38  hz , but a dynamical shift of only 400  mhz .",
    "the scattering rate becomes comparable to the dynamical shift for a detuning of only 1  ghz , which is realistically too small for precision measurements .",
    "a more promising experimental realization is possible by driving microwave transitions in the hyperfine structure of the ground electronic level of atoms . here ,",
    "spontaneous emission is completely ignorable , as the magnetic - dipole transition lifetimes are much longer than any reasonable laboratory time scale .",
    "in particular , we consider here the @xmath89 ground state of alkali atoms , which is split into two hyperfine levels , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the nuclear - spin quantum number .",

    "this represents the center of an avoided crossing of the @xmath103 and @xmath96 states , and thus the splitting at this bias - field strength , @xmath104 is insensitive to first order to bias - field fluctuations .",
    "this reduces the need for stringent experimental control over magnetic fields , and reduces the most important systematic error in measuring the raman resonances . with the same magnetic field ,",

    "the remaining ( @xmath5 ) driving transition is given by the sum of the other two transition frequencies , or @xmath111  ghz .",
    "both raman driving transitions are driven by circularly polarized fields , while the probe field is driven by linearly polarized field .    continuing with the @xmath81rb example , the raman fields may be applied with rabi frequencies of @xmath112  khz , corresponding to field intensities of about 7.6  w/@xmath113 on both transitions .",
    "microwave fields of this intensity , for example , have been realized around 6.8  ghz in the near - field of an atom chip to manipulate a bose ",
    "einstein condensate of @xmath81rb @xcite .",
    "thus , a field of this strength for the @xmath114  ghz transition is feasible , and the field for the @xmath115  mhz transition should similarly pose no problem . for a raman detuning @xmath116  mhz , the lowest - order dynamical shift from eq .",
    "( [ dyn_shift_approx ] ) is 2.0  khz .    in the choice of parameters here , it is also convenient to have very different raman transition frequencies ( 6.8 and 0.9  ghz for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 fields , respectively ) , to control the secondary ac stark shifts that we have not explicitly accounted for",
    "that is , for example , the 6.8  ghz @xmath5 field driving the @xmath117 transition also couples the the @xmath118 transition at @xmath119  ghz , albeit much farther off resonance .",
    "as long as @xmath10 is held fixed , the stark shift of @xmath103 due to the @xmath6 field is inconsequential , as it simply causes a common shift of both structural and dynamic resonances .",
    "however , the stark shift of @xmath95 due to the @xmath5 field depends on @xmath9 , and thus can cause an additional contribution to the dynamical shift @xmath43 . however , this effect is suppressed by the ratio of the detuning @xmath9 from the @xmath117 transition to the detuning from the @xmath118 transition .",
    "this effect should thus be smaller than the lowest - order shift of @xmath120  khz by a factor of about @xmath121 , and is therefore negligible .",
    "note also that it is important to have raman detunings much smaller than the transition frequencies , in order to suppress the effects of bloch  siegert shifts . by a similar argument , the contribution of the bloch ",
    "siegert shifts should be of the same order as the secondary ac stark shifts .",
    "note that uncertainties in the microwave frequencies are negligible on the scale of khz , so long as the fields are derived from digital synthesizers .",
    "however , the splitting at each detuning must be determined to an accuracy finer than the @xmath120  khz shift .",
    "thus , to resolve this shift of @xmath120  khz , the ( 6.8  ghz ) probe beam should be applied for a time much longer than @xmath122  @xmath123s [ eq .  ( [ time_req ] ) ] , with a rabi frequency small compared to @xmath124 khz [ eq .",
    "( [ intensity_req ] ) ] . the probe field then requires a correspondingly much lower intensity , as compared to the raman fields . the atoms will also need to be well - confined on ms time scales , without inducing spontaneous emission . loading laser - cooled atoms into a dipole trap ",
    "formed by the focused light of a co@xmath82 laser  accomplishes this confinement , with negligible perturbation to the hyperfine structure of the ground electronic state .",
    "care must also be taken in preparing the atoms for the probe measurement .",
    "since the goal is to measure the splitting of the _ dressed _ states at a particular detuning , as described above , we must prepare the atoms in only one of the dressed states .",
    "this is effected , for example , by first optically pumping the atoms ( in the absence of the raman fields , and with only a small magnetic bias field of the order of @xmath88  mg to prevent mixing of states ) into the @xmath125 bare state .",
    "this is accomplished by driving the @xmath126 optical transition with circularly polarized light , while optically depumping the @xmath127 ground hyperfine level .",
    "the @xmath128  kg field should then be turned on adiabatically to produce the correct level configuration without inducing any transitions .",
    "the raman fields should then also be turned on adiabatically , but far from raman resonance .",
    "they can then be adiabatically chirped to the desired raman detuning , transferring the atoms from @xmath103 to @xmath129 .",
    "the probe field should then be activated to attempt to drive atoms to the other dressed state @xmath130 .",
    "finally , the raman fields should again be detuned and adiabatically turned off , and the magnetic field turned off adiabatically as well .",
    "the population transferred to @xmath130 , and thus to @xmath131 , is then measured by fluorescence detection of the @xmath127 population .",
    "finer resolution of the raman splitting is also possible by employing a ramsey - interference technique , applying the probe in two pulses separated in time .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , avoided crossing resonances between dressed energy levels are not uniquely defined . in this paper a @xmath0-level atom in a @xmath1 configuration has been proposed as a simple physical system where the distinction between structural and dynamical aspects of a resonance could be observed . by adiabatically eliminating the third level , an effective @xmath4-dimensional hamiltonian has been obtained , from which an approximate analytical expression for the dynamical shift ( between structural and dynamical resonances ) has been given .",
    "while the dynamical resonance is in principle easy to observe by measuring the maximum rate of a given atomic transition , the determination of the structural resonance is more delicate .",
