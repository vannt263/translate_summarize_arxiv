    "the property of vanishing inter - particle correlations in the initial state is consistently propagated by the hamiltonian dynamics in the @xmath12 limit . for practical purposes ,",
    "the vlasov equation is used as a good approximation for sufficiently large @xmath0 , its validity being limited for short times . although the lifetime of a qss have been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite many aspects of its physical interpretation and phenomenology remain unclear . in the present paper",
    "we discuss how to properly define a timescale for its long - time evolution which is governed by collisional corrections to the vlasov equation leading to the landau or balescu - lenard kinetic equations ( see ref .",

    "must be considered in the kinetic equations , leading to an evolution timescale of order @xmath16 with @xmath17 for homogeneous and of order @xmath0 for inhomogeneous states . for the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model ( see section  [ convergence ] below )",

    "also , as we argue below , for most of the qss a lifetime can not be defined consistently . in such cases",
    "it must be replaced by the notion of a characteristic time scale ( relaxation time ) .",
    "we also study the scope of validity of the vlasov equation for finite @xmath0 and for some representative models with long - range interactions , i.  e.  how the dynamics converges to the mean field ( vlasov ) description as @xmath0 increases and how inter - particle correlations arise and how the dynamics depends on them .",

    "it is shown that provided all inter - particle correlations are dynamically created , they do not alter the validity of the vlasov equation .",

    "the one - particle distribution function at any point of the evolution can thus be used as the initial condition to solve the vlasov equation , which is valid for a given time span starting at this value of time .",

    "appendix  [ appendixa ] presents the dynamics of correlations formalism of balescu and appendix  [ appendixb ] how it can be extended for self - gravitating systems with different masses .",
    "the diagrammatic approach for the solution of the @xmath0-particle liouville equation was used by balescu to deduce the vlasov equation for plasmas as a lower order evolution equation in the plasma parameter@xcite . in this section",
    "we show that the kac factor @xmath19 in the interaction potential leads naturally to the vlasov equation by allowing to select the diagrams contributing to the solution of the liouville equation .",
    "the long - range nature of the interaction manifests itself in the non - vanishing of the mean - field potential in the @xmath12 limit ( see the discussion in section 5.3 of ref .",

    "[ figa1 ] in appendix  [ appendixa ] ) and it would necessarily act on the right on a fourier coefficient describing a correlation , which is at most of order @xmath51 . since we already have a @xmath51 factor from the vertex , for such a diagram to be independent of @xmath0 we should sum over two particles ( each sum contributing a factor @xmath0 ) , but this would lead to vanishing surface terms . therefore the diagram is at most of order @xmath19 . following this reasoning , adding more vertices to the diagram can not result in a diagram independent of @xmath0 .",
    "as a consequence @xmath50 is constant in time up to this order .",
    "similarly , the only non - vanishing contributions to @xmath52 are diagrams formed by any combination of vertices of type d and f ( fig .",
    "[ exvlas ] shows an example of such diagrams ) .",
    "all diagrams contributing to @xmath52 are put into two classes : those beginning at left with vertex f ( class f ) and those beginning with a vertex d ( class d ) .",
    "removing the first vertex f on the left in class f results in diagrams contributing to @xmath53 , and similarly removing the first vertex d on the left in class d gives those contributions to @xmath54 .",
    "thence the formal solution has the following general structure : @xmath55\\:dz , \\label{solgenstr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the contributions from class d and f above after removing the first vertex at its left in each diagram .",
    "differentiating both sides with respect to time introduces a factor @xmath58 in the integrand , and yields after some manipulations : @xmath59 using eq .",
    "( [ r3 ] ) and the results in appendix  [ appendixa ] we finally obtain : @xmath60 equation  ( [ vlasovfinal ] ) is the desired form for a vlasov equation . it can also be obtained in the same way for a system of non - identical self - gravitating particles as explained in appendix  [ appendixb ] .",
    "we now discuss in the next section how to consider the contributions of correlation ( possibly ) present in the initial state .      due to the linearity of the liouville equation eq .",
    "( [ liouvilleeq ] ) as well of the fourier coefficients @xmath61 , the order of magnitude of correlations for the initial distributions are kept constant by the time evolution .",
    "therefore , if all correlations in the system are dynamically created , they are expect to have the same dependency on @xmath0 as in the final state , i.  e.  the thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the microcanonical equilibrium distribution factorizes up to terms of order @xmath51 : @xmath62 the fourier transform of the factorized equilibrium distribution function leads to @xmath63 therefore we assume that the correlation pattern @xmath64}$ ] in eq .",
    "( [ jan29.1 ] ) is at least one order of magnitude less than the purely factored term @xmath65 .",

    "( iv ) in appendix  [ apa2 ] , we see that in figure  [ factex]a either @xmath68 or @xmath69 in order to yield a non - vanishing contribution .",
    "therefore we have three summations over particle indices : @xmath11 , @xmath22 and @xmath70 , contributing with a factor @xmath71 .",
    "the diagram is thus of order @xmath51 .",
    "a similar analysis for the diagram in fig .",
    "[ factex]b implies that it is independent of @xmath0 ( four vertices and four particle indices ) .",
    "therefore in fig .  [ factex ] diagram ( a ) is negligible while ( b ) must be retained .",
    "diagram ( a ) creates a correlation among particles @xmath72 and @xmath73 while diagram @xmath74 does not .",
    "from these examples it is straightforward to see that only a succession of vertices of type d and f contributes to any reduced distribution function @xmath75 , and therefore can not create any correlations among particles @xmath30 through @xmath37 .",
    "this proves that the factorization of the distribution functions is maintained by the dynamics up to terms of order @xmath51 .",
    "more importantly , this result implies that the one - particle distribution function at any stage of the time evolution can be used as the initial condition for the vlasov equation , which then from this new starting point slowly deviates from the finite @xmath0 dynamics due to the cumulative secular effects of lower order collisional terms .",
    "in order to show how different interaction potentials lead to different convergence speed to the vlasov ( mean - field ) dynamics we consider three different one - dimensional models with long - range interactions extensively studied in the literature : the hamiltonian mean field model ( hmf ) , with hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath76 , \\label{hmf}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the position angle of particle @xmath11 and @xmath78 its conjugate momentum , the ring model  @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a softening parameter introduced to avoid the zero distance divergence in the pair interaction potential , and the infinite sheet model in three dimensions , describing @xmath0 infinite planes with constant mass density with motion only along the @xmath81 axis  @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is @xmath11-th particle coordinate .",

    "@xcite for a discussion of its interpretation and formal results valid for self - gravitating systems ) .",
    "all simulations for the one - dimensional models where performed starting from a waterbag initial condition defined by @xmath86 for the hmf and ring models , and @xmath87 for the sheets model .",
    "values chosen for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are indicated in the respective figure captions .",
    "for the two - dimensional self - gravitating systems the initial distribution is given by all particles at rest and homogeneously distributed in a circular shell of inner and outer radius @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations ( md ) were performed using a fourth - order simplectic integrator  @xcite for the hmf and ring models , and an event driven algorithm for the sheets model  @xcite .",
    "time steps for simplectic integration are also indicated in the figure captions .",
    "all vlasov simulations are performed using the approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a numerical grid with @xmath93 points in the @xmath94 or @xmath95 one - particle phase space .",
    "the form of the pair interaction potential for the hmf model is such that the simulation time for md simulations scales with the number of particles @xmath0 and thence simulations with a great number of particles are feasible .",
    "figure  [ hmvconv ] shows the kinetic energy for the hmf model obtained from the solution of the vlasov equation and md simulations with some different values of @xmath0 , with a very good agreement already for @xmath96 up to @xmath97 . the time interval for which finite @xmath0 and vlasov solutions agree increases with @xmath0 , as expected .",
    "simulation for the ring model are shown in figure  [ ringconv ] for some values of the softening parameter @xmath80 , and convergence toward the vlasov values of the kinetic energy gets clearly slower for smaller @xmath80 , as the interaction gets stronger at short distances where collisional effects are more important .",
    "for the self - gravitating sheets model , an increasing agreement with increasing @xmath0 is also obtained as given in figure  [ sheetconv ] .",
    "the convergence to a mean - field description is thus strongly affected by the short range part of the force .",
    "the stronger the latter the more important are the collisional effects , and the smaller the agreement time window of the vlasov equation with the finite @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "even though the vlasov equation can be deduced from the bbgky hierarchy by imposing uncorrelated particles , i.  e.  a fully factored @xmath0-particle distribution function , the results in section  [ vlasovdeduc ] stresses the fact that the order of magnitude of the correlations are preserved by the dynamics and that provided all inter - particle correlations are dynamically created ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) the vlasov equation is valid at any stage of the evolution by considering the one particle distribution function at this given time as the initial condition for the vlasov equation . from this point on its solution",

    "no substantial deviation from the value corresponding to uncorrelated particles is observed .",

    "the pattern observed is similar to that for the ring model .",
    "the position kurtosis undergoes some change during the contraction phase , and then settles down to an almost constant value , while the kurtosis of velocity oscillates around the value @xmath109 corresponding the gaussian distribution .",
    "it becomes apparent that there is no significant build up of correlations besides fluctuations , and these maintain the same order of magnitude along all the time evolution .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in figure  [ selfgravenerg ] for @xmath125 .",
    "the stronger deviations from the uncorrelated value occur around the maximum contraction during the violent relaxation stage as expected due to higher values of the force for closer particles .",

    "a lifetime can be meaningfully ascribed only if a given property of the state changes abruptly , as for instance in the case corresponding to figure  [ stabillust ] where the magnetization changes from a vanishing value associated with a homogeneous state to a non - vanishing value .",
    "nevertheless this abrupt change or dynamical phase - transition  @xcite is due to the loss of vlasov stability of the homogeneous qss .",

    "this would imply that the @xmath0 dependence of the collisional integral in the still unknown kinetic equation would vary with the statistical state , which in the authors opinion would be a quite awkward case .",

    "@xcite and  @xcite only considered small numbers of particles in their simulations ( @xmath143 at the most ) and much smaller than the cases considered here , the @xmath1 and @xmath142 scaling would be due to the small size of their systems .",
