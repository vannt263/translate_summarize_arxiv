    "discrete absorption components ( dacs ) are optical depth enhancements in the absorption troughs of p  cygni profiles , which ( a ) occur very commonly in wind profiles of ob - type stars ; ( b ) accelerate slowly compared with the expected wind flow ; and ( c ) often recur on time scales related to stellar rotation . since the radial optical depth at any position @xmath0 in an expanding wind is given by the sobolev approximation @xmath1 such enhancements can in general be produced by _ increasing _ the local ion fraction , @xmath2 ; _ increasing _ the local wind density , @xmath3 ; _ flattening _ the local velocity gradient , @xmath4 ; or by some combination of these factors , which are inter - related .",
    "the far - ultraviolet region of the spectrum provides access to many different resonance lines , and consequently time - series observations with _ fuse _ provide the diagnostic capability required to disentangle these factors .",
    "we have used _ fuse _ to monitor two o - type supergiants in the large magellanic cloud : sk@xmath567166 [ o4  if+ ] for 18.9 days , where @xmath6 days ; and sk@xmath567111 [ o6  ia(n)fp  var ] for 5.8 days , where @xmath7 days . these time series",
    "are illustrated in figure  [ dynspec ] .",
    "for both stars , dacs recur cyclically in all unsaturated resonance lines on time scales consistent with their estimated rotational periods .",
    "they propagate _ in phase _ through the resonance lines of dominant ions ( e.g. , ) and their adjacent stages ( e.g. , , , ) , as well as trace species like .",
    "however , the dacs have systematically larger amplitudes in the wind profiles of the lower ions , and are substantially weaker in lines of dominant ions .",
    "the dacs are barely detectable in the lines of sk@xmath567111 .      1",
    ".   since the _ fractional _ amplitudes of dacs are different in resonance lines of different ions , dacs _ can not _ be solely due to flattening of the velocity gradient or localized density enhancements .",
    "the absence of variations in  @xmath8955 , an excited transition of the dominant ion , further indicates that any density fluctuations associated with dacs are small at low velocities .",
    "2 .   since the dacs propagate in phase in the resonance lines of all ionization stages where they are detected , from ions below the dominant stage to super - ions ( in particular : and , which exhibit anti - correlated abundances in smooth , steady models ; see , e.g. ,",
    "* ) , _ either _ dacs are unlikely to be produced solely by ionization changes _ or _ their ionization conditions are very different from the background flow .",
    "these results suggest that dacs are not caused by changes in a single physical variable in the expression for @xmath9 , but must instead be caused by interactions between them .",
    "suppose , e.g. , that there is a local flattening of the velocity gradient , as indicated by hydrodynamic simulations of  co - rotating interaction regions \" @xcite .",
    "this flattening is accompanied by an increase in @xmath3 at similar velocities , though different spatial locations .",
    "the observations require that these density perturbations , together with changes in @xmath10 , are small enough to produce only minor variations in the wind profiles of excited transitions and dominant ions .",
    "however , since the abundances of lower ions are preferentially increased by recombination , dacs would be fractionally stronger in them .",
    "finally , enhanced production of lower ions like and might lead to _ correlated _ production of higher ions like and via auger ionization , particularly if sufficient x - ray flux is produced locally by the disturbances in the flow .",
    "ongoing analysis is aimed at disentangling the complicated relationships between these factors more rigorously ."
