    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory of strong interaction in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "while qcd has been well tested in the high energy regime where perturbative calculations can be carried out , it is still unsolved in the low energy , non - perturbative regime . understanding the structure of the nucleon from the underlying theory of qcd , a fundamental and challenging task in nuclear and particle physics , remains an area of active research . with developments in polarized beam ,",
    "recoil polarimetry , and polarized target technologies , polarization experiments have provided new observables on quantities related to the nucleon structure .",
    "the high intensity gamma source ( hi@xmath1s ) at the duke free electron laser laboratory ( dfell ) opens a new window to studies of fundamental quantities related to the structure of the nucleon through polarized compton scattering from polarized targets  @xcite .",
    "such measurements allow access to nucleon spin polarizabilities , which describe the response of a spin - aligned nucleon to a quasi - static external electromagnetic field . since there are no stable free neutron targets , effective neutron targets , such as deuteron and @xmath0he , are commonly used .",
    "a polarized @xmath0he target is an effective polarized neutron target  @xcite due to the fact that the neutron is @xmath290% polarized in a polarized @xmath0he nucleus .",
    "there have been extensive studies employing polarized @xmath0he targets to extract the neutron electromagnetic form factors  @xcite , and neutron spin structure functions  @xcite . to extract information on neutron using a polarized @xmath0he target , nuclear corrections need to be applied which rely on the state - of - the - art calculations of three - body systems .",
    "the hi@xmath1s facility also provides unique opportunities to test the three - body calculations . in 2008 , a first measurement of double polarized three - body photodisintegration of @xmath0he was carried out at hi@xmath1s  @xcite with an incident gamma beam energy of 11.4 mev .",
    "in addition to providing tests of three - body calculations , three - body photodisintegration of @xmath0he is of further importance to experimental tests of the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "a high - pressure , longitudinally polarized @xmath0he gas target  @xcite and a circularly polarized photon beam were employed .",
    "seven liquid scintillator detectors were placed around the @xmath0he target to detect the neutrons from the three - body breakup channel .",
    "the @xmath0he gas target cell was made of aluminosilicate ( ge180 ) glass .",
    "this type of glass has fewer magnetic impurities and is less permeable to @xmath0he atoms than regular pyrex glass .",
    "however , the rich concentration of barium in the ge180 glass produced a large amount of background events in the neutron detectors . to reduce the background for future measurements at hi@xmath1s , a new high - pressure @xmath0he cell made of sol - gel coated pyrex glass has been developed and tested .",
    "the coating technique was developed by doping sol - gel with aluminum nitrate nonahydrate ( al(no@xmath5)@xmath69h@xmath7o )  @xcite .",
    "this method produces a glass with better homogeneity and higher purity via a chemical route .",
    "single sealed pyrex cells produced using the sol - gel coating technique have yielded longer relaxation times than those from cells without the coating  @xcite .",
    "this is the first time that this technique has been applied to a high - pressure @xmath0he target , a double - cell system for nuclear physics experiments .",
    "the smooth paramagnetic - free aluminosilicate glass coated surface reduces the probability of @xmath0he depolarization from the wall .",
    "its low @xmath0he permeability helps prevent the loss of @xmath0he atoms .",
    "this allows long - term operation at temperatures typical of spin exchange optical pumping process ( 185@xmath8c for rb - only - cells and 238@xmath8c for rb - k hybrid cells ) .",
    "the target cell `` bolt '' was coated at the university of virginia and filled at the college of william and mary .",
    "a photon beam test of bolt at hi@xmath1s was carried out in may , 2009 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as the following .",
    "section ii describes the experimental apparatus and procedure .",
    "the target performance and a comparison between theoretical calculations and experimental results are presented in section iii .",
    "the in - beam test results of this new target are reported in section iv .",
    "a schematic of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ experimentalschematics ] .",
    "it consists of a pair of helmholtz coils with a diameter of 173 cm to provide a magnetic holding field with a typical value of 21 g. bolt is a pyrex glass cell coated with aluminosilicate and contains a mixture of rb - k .",
    "it consists of a spherical pumping chamber with a radius of 4.3 cm and a target chamber with a length and a diameter of 38.7 cm and 3.1 cm , respectively .",
    "the chambers are connected by a tube that is 9 cm long with a diameter of 1.3 cm .",
    "the cell is installed in the center of the helmholtz coils with the pumping chamber in an oven .",
    "the @xmath0he polarization is measured using both the nmr - adiabatic fast passage ( afp ) method  @xcite and the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) technique  @xcite .",
    "the afp system includes two @xmath279 cm - diameter rf coils with a separation of 39.5 cm placed horizontally above and below the cell and a pair of rectangular pickup coils located on both sides of the target chamber .",
    "the pickup coils are perpendicular to both the holding field and the rf field .",
    "the epr system includes an 5.1 cm diameter epr coil inside the oven close to the pumping chamber and a photo diode to monitor the epr signal .",
    "details of the polarimetry systems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0he nuclei are polarized through spin - exchange optical pumping .",
    "limits of alkali polarization have been observed for broad band laser light  @xcite and a spectrally narrowed laser is added to the experimental setup .",
    "three lasers with three separate sets of optics are used to produce circularly polarized laser light .",
    "after the optics , the net output power of the two coherent duo - fap broad - band lasers is @xmath278 w and the third spectra - physics narrowed laser has a net power output of 23 w.    before the @xmath0he nuclei are polarized , the cell is heated to 120@xmath8c in a separate oven and a tunable laser is used to probe the line shape of the rb d@xmath9 transition .",
    "collisions between rb and @xmath0he can broaden the resonance lines of rubidium so that the width is proportional to the density of @xmath0he in the cell  @xcite . by measuring the width of the d@xmath9 line ,",
    "the density of @xmath0he is determined to be 5.16@xmath100.29 amagats . to polarize the @xmath0he nuclei ,",
    "the pumping chamber is heated up in the oven by air flowing through three heaters .",
    "the pressure inside the cell is @xmath27.66 atms with the pumping chamber at @xmath11c and target chamber at @xmath12c .",
    "the rb atoms in the pumping chamber are polarized through the optical pumping process and then transfer angular momentum to the k atoms .",
    "the spin exchange collisions between k and @xmath0he and between rb and @xmath0he subsequently polarize the @xmath0he nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the time to reach the maximum polarization for such a rb - k hybrid cell is much faster than a rb - only cell due to the higher efficiency for polarizing @xmath0he by k  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0he polarization measured by the nmr - afp method is recorded every three hours during the polarization accumulation period ( `` pump - up '' period ) .",
    "after the polarization has reached a maximum , epr measurements are carried out to measure the absolute @xmath0he polarization , which can be compared to the value from the nmr signal after water calibration  @xcite . with the lasers off and the alkali no longer in vapor form ,",
    "afp measurements are continued in order to measure the spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath13 , in the cell at room temperature .",
    "the systematic error of the relaxation time is dominated by the uncertainty in the determination of the afp losses , which is derived by fitting @xmath14 consecutive afp measurements to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the afp inefficiency parameter .",
    "the relaxation times are obtained from the exponential decay of the afp signal strength as a function of time , corrected for the afp losses .",
    "the afp system uses an rf amplifier to power the rf coils for the spin flip during the measurement , but the rf amplifier is left off during the time intervals between afp measurements to prevent the polarized @xmath0he atoms from depolarizing due to the wide band amplified rf noise .",
    "the afp signals during the pump - up period are fitted to @xmath17 with the afp inefficiency taken into account , where @xmath18 is the effective pump - up time for the double - cell system .",
    "the three major contributions to @xmath0he depolarization are the @xmath0he dipole - dipole relaxation mechanism , the magnetic field gradient effect and the surface effect on the cell wall . the dipole - dipole relaxation time is calculated to be @xmath2142 hours for bolt  @xcite . the relaxation time due to the magnetic field gradient in our system",
    "is calculated to be over 500 hours  @xcite from the magnetic field mapping data .",
    "the measured pump - up times , @xmath18 , maximum nmr and epr signals , and the double - cell room temperature relaxation times , @xmath13 , are listed in table  [ boltresult ] together with the statistical uncertainties .",
    "since the measured values for @xmath13 are much shorter than the relaxation times from the dipole - dipole effect and the gradient effect , the wall effect on the cell s surface is the most significant contribution to the relaxation of polarized @xmath0he .",
    ".pump - up time ( @xmath18 ) , maximum nmr signal , maximum epr signal , relaxation time ( @xmath13 ) from different measurements for bolt cell , statistical uncertainties included . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the @xmath0he target was placed farther downstream in this experiment , the liquid d@xmath7o target and the longer air path generated considerably more background neutrons . in the 50@xmath8 detectors ,",
    "the yield difference is smaller since they are closer to the liquid d@xmath7o target and the background contamination dilutes the difference .",
    "the improvement using bolt for future experiments compared with linda should be better than the results presented in fig .",
    "[ beamtest ] for an optimal target position , where the background neutron events can be minimized .",
    "furthermore , plans have been made to employ more stable , higher flux ( at least @xmath19/s ) photon beams , better shielding from the downstream d@xmath7o target and a vacuum pipe between the beam source and the target .",
    "all these measures will help reduce the neutron background further for better statistics .",
    "we have tested the world s first high - pressure hybrid @xmath0he pyrex glass cell coated with a thin aluminosilicate glass and have achieved a polarization of @xmath262% determined by both nmr - afp and epr methods .",
    "this value compares favorably with the predicted maximum theoretical @xmath0he polarization value .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter is measured for the first time in a hybrid double - cell system to be @xmath4 .",
    "the in - beam test shows that the sol - gel coated pyrex glass target generates fewer neutron background events than the ge180 glass cell .",
    "this new type of target will be important for the future compton scattering and gdh experiments at hi@xmath1s .",
