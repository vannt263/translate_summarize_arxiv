    "cooperstock and tieu model a galaxy in general relativity as an axially symmetric , pressure free dust cloud with metric @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are functions only of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , thus the metric is stationary @xcite .",
    "they further assume their coordinates to be co - moving with the galactic dust , thus @xmath6 is the four - velocity .    by performing a local diagonalization of the metric",
    "they obtain a relation between the metric and local angular velocity as @xmath7 where the approximate value is appropriate to the order they consider .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 einstein equations are respectively    @xmath10    the second equation is equivalent to the formula @xmath11 where they have defined is not the newtonian gravitational potential . ]",
    "@xmath12    thus the observed rotation curve becomes a boundary condition for the solution to laplace s equation ( [ lap ] ) which they take in the form @xmath13 where the @xmath14 are chosen for orthogonality over the radius of the galaxy .",
    "once @xmath3 is found by fitting this function to the obsersved rotation curve , they derive the density by ( [ dens ] ) and in this way they obtain an excellent fit to the data while obtaining a density profile that accords with observation .",
    "however , it has been pointed out @xcite that , since the solution depends on @xmath15 , equation ( [ neqn ] ) is not satisfied , but rather yields a singular contribution to the @xmath16 plane , which has the properties of an exotic form of matter .",
    "it may be wondered whether this singular disk can be removed by choosing a different solution form or by increasing the complexity of the model .",
    "however , in the following analysis we will show that this is not possible and that model fails to accord with general relativity .",
    "assuming this form of the metric , and without making any approximations , the scalar of volume expansion @xmath17 vanishes ( a semicolon denotes covariant differentiation and a comma denotes partial differentiation ) . defining the space - projection tensor @xmath18 the shear tensor is given by and @xmath19 $ ] denote symmetrization and antisymmetrizaion with respect to the enclosed indices , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath20 and this vanishes as well .",
    "however , the vorticity tensor , given by @xmath21}h^\\alpha_{\\phantom{\\alpha}\\mu}h^\\beta_{\\phantom{\\alpha}\\nu}\\ ] ] does not vanish , but has nonzero components    @xmath22    though the matter in this model does indeed rotate , the rotation is rigid and thus can not characterize a galaxy which is differentially rotating .",
    "it should be emphasized that since @xmath23 is a tensor , this can not be a coordinate effect .    with the present solution",
    "raychaudhuri s equation @xcite simplifies to @xmath24 and in fact reduces to the condition @xmath25 .",
    "this condition is demanded in @xcite on the grounds that the geodesic equation be satisfied .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the geodesics must be circular orbits about the @xmath5-axis , which should not hold in general .",
    "orbits in the @xmath16 plane should indeed be azimuthal , but we can not expect this behavior off that plane . that raychaudhuri s equation demands this condition again reveals the rigidity of the rotation as the coordinate points are in free fall and thus keep proper time @xcite , which here requires @xmath26 . ] .",
    "now , if we seek solutions to ( [ neqn ] ) that are symmetric about the plane , and singularity free , then must require @xmath3 to be independent , but this would lead to an exponentially increasing matter density .",
    "] of @xmath5 . thus ( [ neqn ] ) has the trivial solutions @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants .",
    "the first solution leads to zero density and the second to a constant density under rigid rotation , according to equations ( [ rot ] ) and ( [ dens ] ) .",
    "thus it appears that the physical origin of the singularity is in attempting to describe , in co - moving coordinates , a non - rigidly rotating dust cloud , which the metric ( [ metric ] ) can not .",
    "next , in order to solve the einstein equations cooperstock and tieu perform an expansion of the metric in @xmath30 and conclude that the functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 are of second order , but the function @xmath3 , which couples to the rotation , is of first order . strictly speaking ,",
    "this expansion is not well defined as the expansion parameter has dimensions .",
    "we can form the dimensionless parameter @xmath31 where @xmath32 is some characteristic mass of the system and @xmath33 some characteristic length ( for example , the mass and radius of the galactic core ) .",
    "we then compare equations ( [ neqn ] ) and ( [ rot ] ) : @xmath34 where the order has been shown explicitly . substituting @xmath2 for @xmath3 in the first equation",
    "yields the relation @xmath35 where we have taken derivatives to be of order @xmath36 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath37 and since the quantity under the square root is of order unity , we have @xmath38 which is expected from newtonian theory and is the basis of the ppn expansion .    now , suppose we choose a coordinate system in which the galactic dust has coordinate velocity @xmath39 , so that the stress - energy tensor has the form @xmath40 in the @xmath9-subspace .",
    "the @xmath9-einstein equation then has the form @xmath41 up to a factor of order unity due to the constraint condition @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the right hand side of this equation begins at order @xmath43 according to ( [ order ] ) , whereas the left hand side is of order @xmath44 according to ( [ neqn ] ) , since @xmath3 is assumed to be of order @xmath45 .",
    "thus the assumption that @xmath3 is of first order is inconsistent , while consistency requires that @xmath3 be of at least third order .",
    "moreover , given the form of the stress - energy tensor above , suppose we make a _ global _ transformation @xmath46 to the co - moving frame , so that all components of the new stress - energy tensor vanish except the density .",
    "the new metric will have the same form as the old metric , but for the differential @xmath47 we have @xmath48 which necessarily introduces time - dependence into the new metric unless @xmath49 is spatially - independent , that is , unless the rotation of the matter is rigid .",
    "thus , contrary to the assumption of coopertock and tieu , the metric ( [ metric ] ) can not both be co - moving and time - independent .",
    "this accords with zero value of the shear tensor above .",
    "it can be seen in the following figure that a co - moving metric of a differentially rotating system is time - dependent and possesses shear . here , @xmath4-coordinate lines `` twist '' up in time relative to observers at spatial infinity .",
    "@xmath50 has been plotted , where @xmath51 is the fit to the milky way from @xcite .",
    "in this section we carry out an expansion of the metric ( [ metric ] ) in a system of reference in which the galactic dust has coordinate velocity @xmath52 which is physically the angular velocity measured by observers at spatial infinity @xcite . in this direct approach",
    "we will show that the angular momentum coupling is too weak to account for the flat rotation curves .",
    "we expand the metric ( [ metric ] ) as    @xmath53    where the over - script indicates the order of the term in @xmath45 , which is the same as defined in ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "the presence of only even terms in the @xmath54 and odd in @xmath55 are for the appropriate behavior under time - reversal @xcite .",
    "the constraint condition @xmath56 requires that @xmath57 and thus the stress energy tensor has the expansion    @xmath58    as seen in the previous section , @xmath59 increases the order by two so that the right - hand side of the einstein equations are of second order and higher , thus the @xmath9 equation to first order is @xmath60 so that the lowest order term of @xmath3 is sourceless .",
    "we are free to choose @xmath61 however we wish to make the solution simplest , thus we set @xmath62 . with this selection",
    "the einstein equations through third order become    @xmath63    we see that @xmath64 must be a constant so that we have    @xmath65    thus we see that the coupling to the angular momentum is of third order , there is no longer a nonlinear term in the mass density is written to fourth order the nonlinearity due to @xmath3 is not present . ] , and we can identify @xmath66 with the newtonian gravitational potential .    if we analyze circular orbits on the plane the geodesic equation demands that @xmath67 which to third order can be written for @xmath68 as @xmath69 which is recognized as the newtonian centripetal equation plus second order corrections in the last term effectively lowers the order by one . ] .",
    "thus the matter essentially moves according to the predictions of newtonian gravitation with corrections of order @xmath70 , which can not account for flattening of the rotation curves without extra non - luminous matter .",
    "finally , we can compute the shear tensor , which has the non - zero components    @xmath71    all of which vanish exactly when @xmath49 is constant .",
    "it has been shown that the cooperstock - tieu galaxy model is inconsistent as a general relativistic model and that a proper model fails to account for the flatness of the rotation curves without the dark - matter hypothesis .",
    "this failure is due to the weakness of the metric coupling to the angular momentum of the galaxy .",
    "however , the flat rotation curves seem to imply a large inertial induction effect , where the rotating inner matter boosts the rotation of the outer matter , leveling off the rotation curve , which is what the cooperstock - tieu model attempts to describe within general relativity .",
    "since their solution predicts a matter density well within visible limits it is quite possible that their solution represents an alternative , more machian , gravitational theory where inertial induction effects are much larger than in general relativity .",
