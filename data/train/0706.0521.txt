    "a null point ( or neutral point , 3d root ) is a location where the strength of a continuous vector field , such as a magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) , is locally zero ( i.e.  @xmath1 ) .",
    "null points in magnetic fields are important sites for current sheet formation@xcite , energy dissipation via either magnetic reconnection@xcite or wave dissipation@xcite .",
    "furthermore , null points are useful for finding other important topological features@xcite , for example separatrix surfaces and separators .",
    "separatrix surfaces ( also known as @xmath2 or fan surfaces ) are a set of fieldlines which originate or terminate at a null and divide two topologically distinct regions .",
    "two separatrix surfaces intersect at a separator ( or @xmath3 line ) , a special fieldline which connects two null points . both separatrix surfaces and separators",
    "are locations where reconnection preferentially occurs .",
    "examples of magnetic null points have been detected in the laboratory@xcite and in the earth s magnetosphere@xcite and they are believed to be important in many astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares and magnetic sub - storms .    in a finite volume , null points may be found in one of two locations : on the boundary or inside the volume . in general , boundary null points may be found using a 2d method on two of the three components , with the third component used to check whether any resulting locations are really null points .",
    "internal null points may exist anywhere within the volume and require a 3d method to locate them .",
    "methods using the poincar index such as greenes@xcite work on analytical or numerical fields that are divided into a series of cells . by considering the cell translated in magnetic field space and then mapped onto the unit sphere , their methods deduce if the magnetic field space surrounds a null point .",
    "this method can give false positives and false negatives , as discussed in detail later .",
    "furthermore , the null point itself is not actually located , only the grid - cell it is in , unless further assumptions are made , such as multiple iterations for analytical fields or an interpolation approach is chosen for a numerical field .",
    "more recently , zhao@xcite has also proposed essentially the same null finding method .    in recent years",
    "the use of large computer simulations of magnetic fields has increased , and the output of these experiments is usually as a grid of points , which divide the space into a grid of cells . to analyse this data",
    "a fast and accurate null - finding method is required . for fieldlines to be traced within the experimental domain knowledge of the field between the grid points is required . to estimate the field between gridpoints ,",
    "the field is interpolated , usually using the method of trilinear interpolation .",
    "although in general this does not conserve @xmath4 , it is a good first approximation of the magnetic field between grid points .",
    "for many situations ( e.g.  to calculate separatrix surface fieldlines ) , it is necessary to know exactly where the null points lie to sub - grid resolution .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new simple trilinear ( tl ) method of finding null points that finds the null points of the actual field traced ( using trilinear interpolation ) to subgrid resolution .",
    "we compare our tl method with the commonly used greene s method identifying the limitations of each method .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : nulls_interpolation ] we present the linear , bilinear and trilinear equations .",
    "then in section  [ sec : nulls_method ] the trilinear ( tl ) method and greene s method are described .",
    "section  [ sec : nulls_examples ] gives comparative examples of the use of the two methods and section  [ sec : nulls_comparison ] describes the limitations of the two methods for linear and non - linear fields .",
    "the conclusions ( section  [ sec : nulls_conclusions ] ) gives a brief discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of each method .",
    "the simplest form of interpolation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in 1d is linear interpolation , which generates an equation of the form : @xmath7 for simplicity we write @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we expand this to 2d by interpolating linearly along the horizontal sides of a square ( of unit length ) and then by linear interpolation between the two resulting points .",
    "points along the bottom of the square are given by @xmath11 and along the top by @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 etc . )",
    "then the field at a point @xmath14 is given by interpolating along the vertical line of constant @xmath15 between points @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "hence , @xmath18 for constants @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "clearly , this gives exactly the same answer if one interpolates first along the vertical edges of the square for constant @xmath15 and then horizontally for constant @xmath23 .",
    "expanding this to 3d , we obtain the trilinear equation for the field at a point @xmath24 inside a cube of unit length , @xmath25 the values of the constants are unique for each cube , and are found to be : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , etc .",
    "these equations form a simple method of interpolation in up to three dimensions and have the property that the values on the shared surface of adjacent cubes are equal .",
    "higher - order methods such as cubic , bicubic and tricubic , are not discussed in this paper .",
    "we will make use of the roots of a pair of bilinear equations later and so discuss how to find their roots here .    for any pair of general bilinear equations",
    "@xmath28 with @xmath29 the values of @xmath15 and @xmath23 which satisfy @xmath30 may be found by solving either of the respective quadratic equations @xmath31 or @xmath32 the resulting 2d coordinate is found using @xmath33 for any known @xmath15 where @xmath34 , or using @xmath35 for any known @xmath23 where @xmath34 .",
    "the trilinear ( tl ) and greene s null - finding methods are both split into three distinct parts . the first part , which is the common to both methods , quickly scans over every grid - cell removing most cells which do not contain a null point .",
    "the second parts are specific to each method and deduce if a null point does or does not exists inside a flagged grid - cell .",
    "the third parts locate the null point within the grid - cell .",
    "all three parts of both methods are described below .",
    "the first stage of both algorithms is to take every grid - cell and use a simple test to examine whether a null point can exist inside the grid - cell or not .",
    "the test assumes that within each cell the field is linear or trilinear .",
    "thus an implicit assumption for both methods is there is adequate resolution in the data .",
    "a direct consequence of the trilinear assumption is that it forces the range of values of @xmath36 inside the cell to lie between the minimum and maximum values of @xmath36 at the corners , and similarly for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "hence , @xmath36 can never be zero inside the cell provided that @xmath36 is non - zero and of the same sign at each corner of the cell .    at each corner of the cell , the signs of the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "are considered in turn .",
    "should any of the three magnetic field components have the same sign at all eight corners of any cell , then that cell is removed from further analysis , as it can not contain a null point .",
    "the analysis part of the tl method is based upon the fact that a null point , if it exists , must lie on all three of the following curves : @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these curves must be one of two types : ( i ) a circuit inside a cell or ( ii ) a curve that extends through the boundary of the cell at either end .",
    "the first case equates to having two null points within a cell .",
    "this implies considerable sub - grid structure and clearly shows insufficient grid resolution , as does greene@xcite .",
    "the second case is the most important , and the tl algorithm is designed to detect these types of null points .    on the surface of the cell",
    "the lines @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are found .",
    "clearly , due to the trilinear nature inside the cell , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are bilinear on each face of the cell .",
    "this allows us to use the analytical solution presented in section  [ sub : nulls_inter_bisolve ] , for any pair of bilinear equations , to find all intersections of each of the three pairs of lines @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 on all faces of the cell .",
    "these intersections represent all locations where any of the intersection curves ( e.g.  @xmath39 ) cross the boundary of the cell .",
    "in general , each of these intersection curves must pierce the boundary of the cell in pairs .",
    "indeed , this is a necessary condition for a single null point to exist along any such intersection curve .",
    "however , it is possible that there may be more than one pair of points where the intersection curves cross the cell boundary .",
    "a null point only exists if given any single intersection curve inside the boundary , with a pair of end points on the boundary , the third component is of opposite sign at the end points .",
    "once the existence of a null point has been deduced within a given cell , we then locate its position to subgrid resolution .",
    "there are many possible methods to do this .",
    "we have found the following newton - raphson method fast and generally successful .",
    "a 3d version of the iterative newton - raphson method for finding roots of equations has the step : @xmath45^{-1}\\vec{b}(\\vec{x_{n}})\\ ] ] where @xmath46_{ij } = \\frac{\\partial b_{i}}{\\partial    x_{j}}.\\ ] ] this is repeated until @xmath47 or @xmath48 is less than a given tolerance .",
    "when the trilinear assumption is used , the differentials can be explicitly written in terms of the components of @xmath49 , and we choose @xmath50 to be at either the centre of the cell or a cell corner .",
    "various starting points are tried until the iterative method succeeds at some point within the cell .",
    "if this method fails we split the grid - cell into eight subgrid - cells using trilinear interpolation and use the tl method again on these eight new cells .",
    "as an aside it is clear that this method may also be implemented for any 2d field ( say when @xmath44 ) . by using the fast scanning method described in the first part of the algorithm on the four points around a grid - square for @xmath36 and @xmath37 only , we remove many locations where a 2d null point can not exist .",
    "the locations of any null points in this 2d field is then found by solving the pair of bilinear equations ( in @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) derived from the values of the magnetic field at the corners .",
    "greene@xcite proposed a method based on the poincar index theorem to determine the existence of a null point within a given cell .",
    "we give a brief description here for completeness .",
    "the analysis part of the algorithm , determines the existence of a null point within a grid - cell .",
    "each of the six rectangular faces which make up the boundary of the cell is divided into two triangles , of which there are two choices ( a point which shall be important later ) .",
    "for each triangle ,",
    "the positions of the three magnetic field vectors @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are ordered in a right - handed manner about the normal vector of the cell . from this the _ area contribution _ ( @xmath54 ) of the triangle , is calculated from @xmath55 and @xmath56 finally the area contribution , @xmath54 , is chosen to be negative if @xmath57 is negative , else the area contribution is taken to be positive .",
    "the deviation of these area contributions is trivial to show using spherical geometry techniques .",
    "the topological degree of the cell is determined by summing up all twelve area contributions , and then dividing the result by @xmath58 .",
    "the cell contains a null point if the topological degree is non - zero ( a positive null if the degree is @xmath59 , a negative null if @xmath60 ) .",
    "further refinement is given by bisecting the cell to gain greater accuracy .",
    "greene@xcite also implemented a method of guessing the location of a null point near the point @xmath61 ( the secant method ) by solving the three simultaneous equations @xmath62 for @xmath15 , @xmath23 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are small .",
    "this approach is similar to the newton - raphson method which was described earlier .",
    "to demonstrate the differences between the tl and greene s method , we consider a couple of examples .          the speed and accuracy of the null - finding methods",
    "is tested on a frame of a numerical experiment involving a twisted flux tube rising through another twisted flux tube beneath the solar photosphere@xcite . both the tl method and greene s method positively identified the same six grid - cells containing null points in the frame ( see figure  [ fig : nulls_example_michelle ] ) .",
    "the tl method took just 24.9 seconds to do this compared to greene s 25.0 seconds , hence the algorithms operate at comparable speeds .",
    "the reduction phase reduced the number of grid - cells to search from 581433 to 781 ( a reduction of 99.87% ) .",
    "the accuracy of the tl method and greene s test were compared using a sample frame of a simulation of the earth s magnetosphere@xcite .",
    "both methods returned the same eight null points , but greene s test found another two possible null points and the tl method found a further six ( see figure  [ fig : nulls_example_dorelli ] ) .",
    "clearly in a numerical experiment it is not possible to know exactly what the field inside the cells without rerunning the experiment at higher resolution , which is rarely practical .",
    "however , if we assume the field to be trilinear within each cell , it is possible to show that greene s extra `` nulls '' are false positives and that tl s extra nulls are actual null points . in the next section , we shall discuss the accuracy of both techniques , with respect to analytic types of field .",
    "all linear fields can be written in the form @xmath71\\vec{x } + \\vec{d},\\ ] ] where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are arbitrary constant vectors of the form @xmath76 .",
    "provided the matrix @xmath77 = [ \\vec{a}\\;\\;\\vec{b } \\;\\;\\vec{c}]$ ] is non - singular ( which is the case for a generic 3d field ) , this can be rewritten as @xmath78(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}_{n } ) , $ ] where @xmath79^{^{-1}}\\vec{d}$ ] .      to demonstrate that greene s method will always correctly identify null points in a linear field ,",
    "we need only consider the signs of the triangular area contributions ( @xmath54 ) , which are each given by the triple scalar product @xmath80 for triangle @xmath81 .",
    "hence , @xmath82(\\vec{p}-\\vec{x}_{n})\\right\\ }          \\cdot\\left\\{\\left[\\nabla\\vec{b}\\right](\\vec{q}-\\vec{x}_{n})\\right\\ }          \\times\\left\\{\\left[\\nabla\\vec{b}\\right](\\vec{r}-\\vec{x}_{n})\\right\\ }          \\nonumber \\\\     & = &   \\left|\\nabla\\vec{b}\\right|           \\left(\\left\\ { \\vec{p}-\\vec{x}_{n } \\right\\ } \\cdot   \\left\\ {          \\vec{q}-\\vec{x}_{n } \\right\\ } \\times \\left\\ { \\vec{r}-\\vec{x}_{n }          \\right\\ } \\right )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly @xmath83 is constant and hence of fixed sign throughout the domain .",
    "so if we determine @xmath84 for all triangles in a right - handed manner relative to the outwards normal vector of the volume enclosed by the triangles then , if there is a null point inside this volume , the sign for each @xmath84 will be the same . if positive there is a negative null point inside the volume , if negative a positive null point .",
    "in particular , note that the sign of both triangles on any one face of a cell will be the same . hence , greene s method will always find a null point if one exists within the volume .",
    "if the null point is outside the cell , the triangles relative to @xmath85 have @xmath84 of mixed sign .",
    "clearly , if a null point exists within a cell then the topological degree is either @xmath86 . for any linear field containing a null point",
    ", it is possible to choose cells of any size and still resolve the field within the cell .",
    "this lets us consider a large cell that contains a null point .",
    "this large cell may be divided in to a grid of @xmath87 smaller cells , of which @xmath88 do not contain a null point .",
    "the topological degree of this big cell must be the sum of the topological degrees of the smaller cells which span it .",
    "furthermore , we note that the topological degrees for the large cell and the small cell containing the null point are 1 ( assuming we have a negative null point , without loss of generality ) . thus , by considering the case of @xmath89 and working up , it is clear that the topological degree of all smaller cells without a null point may be deduced to be zero",
    ". therefore , the topological degree determined by greene s method will always be correct for any cell in a linear field .",
    "similarly we can show that the tl method also always correctly identifies a null point in a linear field .",
    "if we consider the surface @xmath90 where @xmath91 , and the surface @xmath92 where @xmath93 , then their intersection will be a straight line in the direction @xmath94 and the line will be of the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is any point on both planes .",
    "an obvious choice for this point is the null point , @xmath85 , hence @xmath97^{-1}\\vec{d}.   $ ] calculating @xmath0 along this line , we find @xmath98 \\left\\ { \\vec{n}s -                     \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\vec{a } & \\vec{b } & \\vec{c }                      \\end{array}\\right]^{-1}\\vec{d}\\right\\ } + \\vec{d }             \\nonumber \\\\               & = & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\vec{a } & \\vec{b } & \\vec{c }                     \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\left\\langle a_{1 } , b_{1 } , c_{1 }             \\right\\rangle \\times \\left\\langle a_{2 } , b_{2 } , c_{2 }             \\right\\rangle s\\right ) - \\vec{d } + \\vec{d } \\nonumber \\\\               & = & \\left|\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\vec{a } & \\vec{b } & \\vec{c }                     \\end{array}\\right]\\right| s \\hat{\\vec{z}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this it is obvious that @xmath38 does not change sign along its length except at the null point ( when @xmath99 ) .",
    "we have a two cases :    1 .",
    "part of the line is inside the cell : since the line is straight and of infinite length , then for any finite volume which the line passes through , the line intersects the surface at least twice .",
    "the tl method detects these locations . since the sign of @xmath38 changes only at the single null on this line ,",
    "the null point must be inside the cell if , and only if , the sign of @xmath38 is different at the locations where it intersects the surface of the cell .",
    "thus this agrees with the tl method .",
    "none of the line is inside the cell : since the ( only ) null point is on this line , it can not be inside the cell . as the tl method does not detect this line on the surface of the cell",
    ", it rightly returns that no null exists within the cell .",
    "this above argument holds for all pairings of field components .",
    "furthermore , since the field is linear , the final positioning part will succeed after the first step , as the iterative step , @xmath100^{-1 } \\vec{b}(\\vec{x}_{i } )      =    \\vec{x}_{i } - \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\vec{a } & \\vec{b } & \\vec{c }          \\end{array}\\right]^{-1 } \\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc }             \\vec{a } & \\vec{b } & \\vec{c }           \\end{array } \\right ] \\vec{x}_{i } + \\vec{d }",
    "\\right )      =    - \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\vec{a } & \\vec{b }           & \\vec{c } \\end{array}\\right]^{-1}\\vec{d }       =    \\vec{x}_{n},\\ ] ] for any value of @xmath101 .",
    "nonlinear fields are clearly more complicated than linear fields and this is where the results from the two methods can diverge .",
    "we return to the results of example  ii , where we have noted discrepancies between the results of greene s method and the tl method . by swapping the choice of triangles for each face of the grid - cells for greene s method , we find fourteen null points with this alternative implementation .",
    "six are new , four the same as those found previously by the tl method alone and a further four are the same as four found previously by both the tl method and the original greene s implementation .",
    "this leads to a curious result about the nature of greene s method when implemented for non - linear fields .",
    "it is known that the sum of all the area contributions in greene s method must sum up to an integer , and the triangles chosen for each face may be changed independently from the other faces . if the result of greene s algorithm changes depending on the choice of triangles , then the difference between the area contributions using one choice of triangles on the face must be an integer difference to the other choices .",
    "using example  ii , we found that different implementations of greene s method could add or remove a null point , or even ( in a few cases ) change the sign of the null point .    to further this investigation",
    ", we analysed a set of trilinear fields where the solenoidal condition ( @xmath4 ) was satisfied .",
    "this choice of non - linear field is chosen because the field inside numerical cells is typically assumed to be trilinear and because the tl method can easily find these null points .",
    "numerous fields were found ( using a method described in appendix  [ app : greene_failure ] ) where at least one of the faces of a cell would change the topological degree in the cell depending on the choice of triangles producing both false negatives and false positives .",
    "although most of the cases involved the null point existing near the face in question , some cases were found where null points were near the grid - cell s centre .",
    "an example trilinear field is given below which contains two null points and demonstrates the curious behaviour of greene s method under different implementations .",
    "@xmath102    in this example field , we have a negative null point at @xmath103 and a positive null point at @xmath104 .",
    "in the cell @xmath105 ^ 2\\ !",
    "\\times\\ ! [ -1,0]$ ] which contains no null point , greene s algorithm gives the topological degree to be @xmath59 or @xmath106 depending on how the face @xmath107 is divided ( see figure  [ fig : nulls_tri_example ] ) .",
    "we now extend our region of interest to the sequential group of cells @xmath105^{2}\\ !",
    "! [ -1,0]$ ] , @xmath105^{3}$ ] , @xmath105^{2}\\ !",
    "! [ 1,2]$ ] , @xmath105^{2}\\ !",
    "\\times\\ ! [ 2,3]$ ] and @xmath105^{2}\\ !",
    "\\times\\ ! [ 3,4]$ ] .",
    "in this case we have four internal faces between the cells .",
    "if we consider only implementations of greene s method where the triangles coincide on these faces , of which there are sixteen , each yields a different result : one with no null points in any cell ( i.e.topological degree of the cells is @xmath108 for increasing @xmath63 ) , ten results detect one positive and one negative null point ( e.g.  @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 where order must be @xmath59 then @xmath112 ignoring zeros ",
    "note one of these is the correct solution @xmath113 ) and five with two positive and two negative null points ( e.g.  @xmath114 , again in order @xmath59 , @xmath112 , @xmath59 , @xmath112 with the @xmath106 in any one of the five cells ) .",
    "thus , greene s method may ( i ) move null points a significant distance or ( ii ) change the number of null points .",
    "furthermore it is not possible to say which of the above implementations of greene s method is correct without either prior knowledge of the result or increasing the resolution of the grid . in an analytical field case , bisecting over the complete region",
    "will generally reduce the likelihood of such a failure , but on a numerical grid this would require assumptions about the magnetic field within the domain .    in this example",
    "the ratio of the maximum absolute value of the nonlinear terms to the linear terms is 0.95 , showing significant nonlinearity .",
    "but significant nonlinearity is not essential for greene s method to give a false reading , as example  ii includes a number of cases where the ratio in such cases is lower than 0.25 .",
    "note in the above example we always choose the triangles on the internal cell faces to coincide for both cells on either side of the face . thus in swapping the choice of triangles ( for both grid - cells ) , we can only add or remove null points in opposite polarity pairs or move the existing null point between grid - cells leaving the overall topological degree of the region unchanged .",
    "should the triangles of only one of these two cells on either side of the face change , then this cell could create or destroy a single null point .",
    "hence , it is important that when implementing greene s method , the triangles of all internal faces are chosen to coincide .",
    "we now discuss the accuracy of the tl method .",
    "first , we shall look at the nature of trilinear fields , followed by a discussion of the accuracy for a general non - linear field .",
    "trilinear fields have four non - linear terms ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) , and are solvable using the tl method . an important point to note though",
    "about trilinear fields is that they are not rotationally preserved , e.g.  if we take the function @xmath119 , and rotate it by 45@xmath120 about @xmath121 then we obtain the function @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the function in the rotated space @xmath124 , which is obviously not trilinear . hence , if we rotate a grid by any angle , the exact results of the tl method may vary .",
    "since the tl method only locally approximates the field as trilinear , it may still be used to locate the null point in the rotated field .    if we relax the conditions to a general non - linear field , it is possible using the tl method for a null point to be found in a different cell if the field is sufficiently non - linear .",
    "as a null point exists on the intersection of a line ( @xmath125 , say ) and a surface ( @xmath126 , say ) , and both of these are either closed or extend through the boundary of the full domain , null points can only be removed or added in pairs within the domain , or singularly though the boundary of the full domain . if we consider that a null point is at the intersection of the three surfaces ( @xmath91 , @xmath93 and @xmath127 ) and hence at the corner of the eight volumes bounded by these three surfaces .",
    "this null point may only be removed if any of these eight volumes is removed .",
    "provided the grid is fine enough , then there should exist a grid point within each volume bounded by the three surfaces . since the grid point has a known field , it must stay within the same volume , and hence the volume can not be destroyed , even if the resulting trilinear field is vastly different from the real field .",
    "thus , no null points can disappear for the tl method ( although its position may vary ) if this condition is satisfied .",
    "we clarify this with a 2d example .    if the above argument is considered in 2d , the surfaces ( @xmath91 , etc . ) become lines and the volumes bounded by the surfaces become areas bounded by lines .",
    "an example grid with @xmath91 and @xmath93 is shown in figure  [ fig : nulls_rap_success]a . for a null point to be found in 2d , the tl method looks for intersections of the lines @xmath91 and @xmath93 . since the tl method assumes the field within four grid points to be bilinear , these lines may be deformed from the real field .",
    "however , the real field is known at each grid point , so the lines @xmath91 , etc .",
    "found must pass through the same edge as the real lines @xmath42 , etc .",

    "it is well known that the location of null points is important in the understanding of magnetic topology and for some types of reconnection and wave dissipation . here",
    ", we have presented a new technique , the trilinear ( tl ) method , for finding null points in a magnetic field , in particular for whose field is calculated using numerical code .",
    "the tl method includes three stages . a reduction stage to quickly remove most grid - cells which do not contain a null point .",
    "an analysis to positively identify cells containing a null point using the bilinear nature of the field on the boundaries , and finally a stage to determine the exact location of the null point according to trilinear interpolation .",
    "we compare our tl method with the poincar index based method of greene@xcite .",
    "both the tl and greene s method are accurate for all linear fields .",
    "the tl method is in general accurate for most nonlinear fields .",
    "null points may be falsely created or destroyed , either in pairs or lost through the boundary of the domain where the field within a cell is highly nonlinear . if we restrict the field to being trilinear within cells , the tl method is accurate except when two null points exist within one cell making it highly suitable for numerical magnetic fields .",
    "greene s method has similar failings to the tl method . in greene",
    "s method the choice of triangles on the cell faces is arbitrary . in certain ( moderately as well as highly ) non - linear fields",
    "different implementations of greene s algorithm , assuming a different choice of triangles , give rise to failings in the method .",
    "if triangles on internal faces are kept coincident , null points can only be lost in pairs from inside the domain ( or singularly through the boundary ) . however , if the triangles on internal faces are not kept coincident then null points may be created and destroyed singularly from anywhere within the domain .",
    "a single implementation of greene s method should not be used on its own as it is not clear how many or where the null points should be .",
    "a result can only be relied upon if all coincident triangle implementations agree . by using different implementations of greene s method",
    "it is possible to detect where green s method is failing , but this does not help give the correct answer unless the resolution of the grid can be increased .",
    "however , greene s algorithm is very useful for finding null points in analytical fields , whilst the tl method is most applicable for numerical fields .",

    "a means to finding a cell where greene s algorithm fails is as follows . looking at a face of a cell , say @xmath107 with @xmath137 $ ] , the magnetic field vectors are @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 at the corners . on our face , we wish to have each pair of triangular area contributions to have opposite sign .",
    "so , for instance , the triple scalar products of the magnetic field vectors in the corners may satisfy @xmath142 or have all inequalities reversed .",
    "since multiplying any vector by a positive constant does not change the sign of the triple vector product , we shall assume all vectors are normalised .",
    "let us then choose an invertible matrix @xmath143 , which satisfies the following three properties : @xmath144 for some @xmath145 . from this",
    "we find a @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 such that @xmath150 thus our inequalities become @xmath151 from these we deduce that @xmath152 now , let @xmath153 so that the last two inequalities become @xmath154 provided that @xmath155 , otherwise the inequalities are reversed .",
    "now we may choose any value for @xmath131 and @xmath145 , then find values for @xmath146 and @xmath147 so that either pair of the above equalities hold , and choose a @xmath156 and @xmath157 which satisfy @xmath158 . to satisfy the final conditions ,",
    "let @xmath148 and @xmath149 be given from this table :    c|*3c@c @xmath159 & @xmath160 & @xmath160 & @xmath161 & @xmath161 + & @xmath162 & @xmath163 & @xmath162 & @xmath163 + [ 0em][0em]@xmath164 & @xmath165 & @xmath166 & @xmath167 & @xmath168 + & @xmath169 & @xmath170 & @xmath171 & @xmath172 + [ 0em][0em]@xmath173 & @xmath174 & @xmath175 & @xmath168 & @xmath167 + & @xmath171 & @xmath172 & @xmath169 & @xmath176    thus , provided @xmath146 and @xmath147 can be found , a field can be generated by taking the subsequently found @xmath148 and @xmath149 and creating the four corner vectors of the face .",
