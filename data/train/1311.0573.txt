    "note that while certain steps in this algorithm must be performed in the order given , in other cases the order can be varied with no effect on the algorithm s correctness . for example",
    ", step 10 ( performing reductions on @xmath2 ) could be executed before any of the steps 3 through to 9 without affecting the outcome of the algorithm .",
    "however , steps 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 , all of which deal with edge - vertex - cutsets , must be performed in the order given , since , for example , the theorem given in section [ separatingsets ] regarding type 2 edge - vertex - cutsets only applies to graphs with no type 1 edge - vertex - cutsets .",
    "note also that while step 11 could be performed earlier in the algorithm without altering its correctness , for the purposes of efficiency it is more desirable that this step be performed later .",
    "steps 2 , 3 , 4 , and 12 use the same techniques as the algorithms presented in @xcite and @xcite for solving shp(@xmath6 ) , shp(@xmath7 ) , and shp(@xmath8 ) .",
    "step 5 uses the same technique as in the algorithm of @xcite to deal with internal 4-edge - cutsets .",
    "steps 5 to 9 deal with the new forbidden separating sets defined in section [ separatingsets ] , and the correctness of these steps follows from the theorems given in that section ( theorems [ edgevertex ] to [ bigfourcutset ] ) . step 10 deals with the forbidden reductions defined in section [ reductions ] , and the correctness of this step follows from the theorems given in that section ( theorems [ reduction1 ] to [ reduction1big ] ) .    using the same arguments given in @xcite , the most complex steps in this algorithm ( those involving finding sets of four edges ; i.e. , steps 4 , 7 , and 9 ) have a worst case complexity of @xmath222 .",
    "thus , assuming an imbalanced division of @xmath2 at each recursion of the algorithm , as with the algorithm for shp(@xmath8 ) in @xcite , this algorithm s total complexity is @xmath223 , and therefore runs in polynomial time .",
    "it is hoped that further work in this area may lead to a characterization for the general wheel , @xmath9 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction to this paper , such a characterization may not be complete , but rather rely on parameterization of the input , taking @xmath10 as the parameter , and yielding an algorithm that is fixed - parameter tractable .",
    "certain features of the algorithm in section [ algorithm ] may lend themselves to a parameterized algorithm .",
    "in particular , the overall structure of the algorithm  breaking down the input graph into smaller , manageable components , until its size is bounded by some constant , then performing exhaustive search on the remaining , constant - sized input  strongly resembles the parameterized algorithmic technique of reducing to a problem kernel , as described in .",
    "it is , however , probable that certain difficulties will arise in looking at characterizations beyond @xmath1 .",
    "given the large increase in length and difficulty between the proofs of the @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 cases @xcite , and even more so between the @xmath8 and @xmath1 case , it seems likely that a characterization involving @xmath224 would be extremely complex .",
    "while some of the techniques used in this paper  all of the reductions defined in section [ reductions ] , for example  are generalizable to higher cases , others are not .",
    "each of the edge - vertex - cutsets defined in section [ separatingsets ] is useful in the algorithm for solving shp(@xmath1 ) because of an associated theorem that applies only to the @xmath1 case  these theorems rely on the fact that for @xmath225 , if @xmath2 contains some @xmath9-subdivision @xmath0 such that @xmath0 is centred on some vertex @xmath226 in an edge - vertex - cutset @xmath66 , there exists some component @xmath204 of @xmath206 such that @xmath204 contains at most three neighbours of @xmath226 in @xmath0 .",
    "this no longer holds when @xmath227 .",
    "thus , in dealing with pattern graphs @xmath9 for @xmath228 , it would be necessary to find new techniques to replace edge - vertex - cutsets , or to develop new theorems that broaden their usefulness",
    ".    it may also be possible to use some of the techniques presented in this paper to work towards characterizing pattern graphs other than wheels .",
    "for example , developing a characterization of graphs containing no subdivisions of @xmath3 would be worth investigating .",
