    "linear irreversible thermodynamics has played important roles in physics , chemistry , and quantitative biology . in particular , the onsager reciprocity  @xcite , characterizing the symmetry of linear transport coefficients , gives deep insight into a variety of phenomena , from the thermoelectric effect  @xcite to membrane transport processes in biological systems  @xcite .",
    "the onsager reciprocity can be placed in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics  @xcite , which is an extension of thermodynamics to small fluctuating systems .",
    "more precisely , the onsager reciprocity and its nonlinear generalization can be derived from the fluctuation theorem  @xcite .",
    "the onsager reciprocity also plays a central role in the finite - time thermodynamics : the efficiency of thermodynamic engines at maximum power ( i.e. , the work per unit time )  @xcite has been studied on the basis of the onsager reciprocity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , novel properties of the linear response matrix beyond the onsager reciprocity have been found for periodically driven systems  @xcite .",
    "stochastic thermodynamics has been further extended to information processing such as measurement and feedback control , which accompanies the refined second law of thermodynamics by taking information into account  @xcite .",
    "this research direction sheds new light on the problem of `` maxwell s demon , '' and the demon has experimentally been investigated @xcite .",
    "thermodynamics of information has also been applied to biological signal transduction and adaptation processes  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , thermodynamics of autonomous information processing has attracted much attention , where an autonomous maxwell s demon reduces the entropy of an engine by continuous measurement and feedback control without any direct energy exchange  @xcite .",
    "such a thermodynamic system is called an autonomous information - driven engine .",
    "it has been shown that continuous information flow can be treated on an equal footing with thermodynamic currents , and the concept of information affinity has been introduced  @xcite . however , general linear irreversible thermodynamics has not been addressed in these previous researches . in particular",
    ", it has been a fundamental open question whether the onsager reciprocity is still valid in the presence of the information flow and the information affinity .    in this paper",
    ", we establish linear irreversible thermodynamics for a broad class of autonomous heat engines in the presence of continuous information flow . we show that the onsager reciprocity is indeed valid with the information affinity , which implies a nontrivial symmetry between thermodynamic and informational currents and affinities . as a special application",
    ", we derive the information - thermodynamic efficiency at maximum power of information - driven engines  @xcite , which , in the linear regime , is universally bounded by the half of the maximum efficiency .",
    "our linear irreversible thermodynamics is applicable if only a driven engine is close to equilibrium , even when the entire system including maxwell s demon is far from equilibrium .",
    "this makes a sharp contrast to conventional linear irreversible thermodynamics , where the entire system must be close to equilibrium .",
    "this feature of our framework is based on a fundamental lemma that is proved in this paper , which states that if all affinities including the information affinity are zero , all the conjugate currents are zero .",
    "this lemma ensures that linear irreversible thermodynamics is a consistent framework even in the presence of the information affinity .",
    "we note that there is previous work about the onsager reciprocity for heat engines driven by `` information reservoirs ''  @xcite . in that work , however , the role of information flow and information affinity was not taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the entire system must be close to equilibrium in their setup , as is the case for conventional linear thermodynamics without information .",
    "our work establishes linear irreversible thermodynamics including continuous information flow .",
    "our result would be applicable to analyze the role of information in biological systems .",
    "in fact , a variety of phenomena in biological systems are found in the linear nonequilibrium regime  @xcite .",
    "membrane transport is one such phenomena  @xcite , where the onsager reciprocity has experimentally been verified  @xcite .",
    "recently , the onsager coefficient has been determined from experimental data of living yeast  @xcite .",
    "we also note that biochemical information processing has been studied with stochastic models similar to our setup  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our theory is applicable if only some biochemical reactions are close to equilibrium , even when an entire biological system is far from equilibrium .    throughout this paper , we assume that a system obeys a continuous - time markov jump process with finite states .",

    "before going to the general argument , we illustrate the essentials of our results by considering a minimal model of information - driven autonomous engines , which we call the four - state model .",
    "this model consists of two subsystems with respectively two states , and thus the whole system has four possible states .",
    "the two subsystems autonomously interact with each other , where they do not directly exchange energy but exchange information .",
    "therefore , one of the two subsystems is regarded as a maxwell s demon that continuously measures the other system and performs feedback control .",
    "our model is equivalent , or almost equivalent , to well - studied autonomous information engines discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which are closely related to transport in biological systems .",
    "the four - state model is a bipartite system that consists of two subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",

    "each system has a single site where a particle comes in from or goes out to one of the attached particle reservoirs .",
    "the chemical potential differences between @xmath9 ( @xmath0 ) and the particle reservoirs are given by @xmath16 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) ( see also fig .  [ 4state ] ) .",
    "the energy of @xmath9 @xmath17 ) is @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) when it is filled with a particle , and zero when it is empty .",

    "we assume that subsystems do not change their own states simultaneously in a single transition , which is equivalent to the bipartite condition of the transition rates : @xmath33    we assume that the transition rates satisfy the local detailed balance conditions : @xmath34 our theory is applicable independent of the details of the transition rates , as long as they satisfy eq .",

    ", the transition rates can be of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36^{-1}$ ] and @xmath37^{-1}$ ] are the fermi distribution functions , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is a positive constant that characterizes the height of the potential barrier between @xmath9 ( @xmath0 ) and reservoir @xmath40 .",
    "the potential barrier of @xmath9 , characterized by @xmath38 , depends on the state of @xmath0 , and vice versa .",
    "as mentioned above , the transition rates between a site and the attached reservoirs are determined by the other site . on the other hand , the two subsystems do not directly exchange energy , because the energy of each site is independent of the state of the other .",
    "these assumptions make it reasonable to call our system as an information - driven engine .",
    "intuitively , each subsystem continuously measures the other system , and performs feedback control by changing the energy barrier between the other system and the attached reservoirs .",
    "in the special case that @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , @xmath9 exchanges a particle only with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) when @xmath0 is empty ( filled ) , respectively . this is a typical model of an autonomous maxwell s demon , where the demon inserts a wall between the engine and reservoirs , depending on the number of particles in the engine  @xcite .      in this subsection , we briefly review previous results on the generalized second law including information flow , which has been discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath43 be the steady state distribution of the four - state model .",

    "( [ info_affinity ] ) and  ( [ infoflow ] ) , the information flow is defined as@xmath57 which represents the change rate in the mutual information induced by transitions in @xmath9 .",
    "we now consider the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the four - state model .",
    "first , the conventional second law for the entire system is given by @xmath58 which implies that the total entropy production written as @xmath59 is nonnegative . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the second law  ( [ total_second ] ) can be decomposed into two inequalities that constitute the generalized second law .",
    "we introduce the partial entropy productions  @xcite associated with @xmath9 and @xmath0 as @xmath60 which make the decomposition of the total entropy production : @xmath61 the generalized second law states that the partial entropy productions are nonnegative individually : @xmath62 both of these inequalities are stronger than the conventional second law  ( [ total_second ] ) . in the generalized second law  ( [ infothermox ] ) , the conventional thermodynamic entropy production  ( [ ep_x ] ) and the information flow are treated on an equal footing .",
    "therefore , inequality  ( [ infothermox ] ) can be regarded as the second law of information thermodynamics for continuous information processing .",
    "inequality  ( [ infothermox ] ) implies that the entropy change in the reservoirs , @xmath63 and @xmath50 , are bounded by the informational flow @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath66 ( i.e. , @xmath0 plays the role of the demon ) , the conventional entropy change of @xmath9 can be negative up to @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 needs an additional cost of at least @xmath68 for the continuous measurement and feedback control .",
    "we now discuss our main results for the four - state model .",
    "first , we can show that if all of the affinities including the information affinities are zero , all of the currents are zero : @xmath69 we will prove this in appendix a in a more general setup .    as a consequence of ( [ zero order condition ] ) , we find that our linear irreversible thermodynamics is applicable if only @xmath45 and @xmath55 are nearly zero , even when the entire system is far from equilibrium as @xmath48 is not close to zero .",
    "in other words , our framework is applicable if only the engine is close to equilibrium both in terms of the thermodynamic and information affinities , even when the demon itself is far from equilibrium .",
    "this is a crucial characteristic of our formulation , which is contrastive to conventional linear irreversible thermodynamics , where the entire system must be close to equilibrium .",
    "we emphasize that this characteristic is not a result of the time - scale separation .",
    "even if the engine and the demon have the same time scale and they interact with each other , we can apply linear irreversible thermodynamics only to the engine by taking into account the information affinity .",
    "let us discuss the above point more quantitatively .",
    "even if @xmath70 , we can make @xmath71 and @xmath72 by appropriately choosing the parameters in the transition rates ( [ bipartite1_1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , as explicitly shown in appendix b , if we assume that @xmath73 does not depend on @xmath40 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , then @xmath72 holds independent of @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "in such a situation , the energy barrier can not change depending on the state of the engine or the demon , which means that the demon can not insert a wall between the engine and the reservoirs .",
    "this intuitive picture is consistent with the absence of the information affinity , @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we can make @xmath76 and @xmath77 just by making @xmath78 and @xmath79 , even when @xmath80 ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) .",

    "the currents can then be expanded to the linear order as @xmath87 the linear expansion  ( [ linear ] ) as a consequence of  ( [ zero order condition ] ) implies that linear irreversible thermodynamics is well - defined even in the presence of information flow .",
    "since the information affinity is not one of the conventional thermodynamic affinities , we can not apply the conventional argument in linear irreversible thermodynamics to prove the onsager reciprocity for the coefficient  ( [ def oc ] ) .",
    "however , the onsager reciprocity indeed holds : @xmath88 which is our main results in the case of the four - state model .",

    "we again emphasize that this is not a straightforward consequence of  ( [ infothermox ] ) .",
    "in fact , a standard proof of the onsager reciprocity based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( or equivalently , the fluctuation theorem ) does not apply to information thermodynamics . instead",

    "therefore , it is naturally expected that the information - thermodynamic efficiency at maximum power is also the half of the maximum efficiency . in the following",
