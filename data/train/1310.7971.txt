    "relativistic electrons can transfer their energy to gamma rays through the process of inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the ambient low energy photons .",
    "together with bremsstrahlung , this process represents a major channel of gamma - ray production by relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) . at energies below 100  mev",
    ", a non - negligible contribution to the gamma - ray continuum can be supplied by annihilation of positrons on flight . in the same energy band",
    ", one may expect a contribution from the synchrotron radiation of electrons .",
    "however , the latter scenario can be effectively realized only in quite unique objects called extreme accelerators , when the particle acceleration proceeds at the maximum ( theoretically possible ) rate . in general , the synchrotron radiation is released well below the gamma - ray band , and , in fact , is considered as a dissipative process as long as it concerns the efficiency of gamma - ray production .",
    "indeed , in environments with the energy density of the magnetic field significantly exceeding the energy density of the radiation field , @xmath1 , only a small fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the kinetic energy of electrons is released in high energy gamma rays . otherwise , the radiative cooling of electrons is dominated by the ic scattering , making the latter an extremely effective gamma - ray production mechanism , especially at very high energies , when the radiative cooling due to bremsstrahlung is suppressed compared to the ic scattering , where @xmath3 is the electron s energy , and @xmath4 is the gas density . ] . because of the large cross - section of the process and the presence of high density radiation fields , the ic scattering undoubtedly is the most prolific and universal gamma - radiation mechanism which contributes from low ( mev ) to ultrahigh ( tens of tev ) energies of emission of almost all nonthermal source populations - supernova remnants ( snr ) , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , compact binary systems , active galactic nuclei , _ etc_.",
    "the energy spectrum of the up - scattered photons depends strongly on the energy of target photon , especially in the thomson regime , when the average energy of the up - scattered photon is proportional to the energy of the target photon . in the klein - nishina regime ,",
    "the most fraction of the electron energy is transferred to the up - scattered photon , thus the dependence on the target photon energy gradually disappears .",
    "given this nontrivial dependence on the target photon energy , the accurate calculations of the ic spectrum require good knowledge of the energy distribution of target photons . fortunately , in many cases the dominant contribution to the ic scattering comes from photons belonging to black - body ( or grey - body ) radiation , i.e. they are described by the standard planckian distribution : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the photon gas temperature and the photon energy , respectively ( hereafter the energies of both photons and electrons , as well as the photon gas temperature , are expressed in units of @xmath8 ) .",
    "planckian distribution is realized in the case of ic scattering on the 2.7 k cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "remarkably , in snrs and pwne in our galaxy , as well as in extragalactic objects like large scale agn jets and clusters of galaxies , the ic scattering in the vhe band is strongly dominated by cmbr .",
    "the target photons for the ic scattering can be well described by the planckian distribution also in compact systems like gamma - ray emitting binaries containing either a pulsar ( binary pulsars ) or a black hole ( microquasars ) . despite the different origins of the nonthermal energy , supported in the first case by a rotation - powered pulsar wind , and in the second case by an accretion - powered jet ,",
    "the most likely mechanism of gamma - radiation is the ic scattering . in both type of objects the target photons",
    "are supplied by the thermal radiation of the bright optical star .",
    "finally , in some cases quite complex photon distributions can be represented as a superposition of several grey - body components .    since the planckian distribution of photons",
    "is characterized by a rapid decrease of the density both at low and at high energies , numerical integrations of the compton cross section over the planckian photon field generally do not impose computational difficulties , but simply require additional computational time .",
    "often , to shorten the calculations , different approximations are used .",
    "the most common approach is the @xmath9-functional approximation for the narrow planckian spectrum .",
    "this approximation can correctly describe the lower energy part of the spectrum , but is not applicable for the precise computations of the entire gamma - ray spectra ( see section  [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "therefore , some other approximations for calculations of ic spectra have been recently suggested in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these approaches provide a better description for the ic spectra and are characterized by a higher precision than the @xmath9-functional approximation does , although they are not free of certain limitations ( see discussion in section  [ sec : comp ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose new , very simple analytical presentations obtained for both isotropic and mono - directional angular distributions of target radiation field assuming that its energy spectrum is precisely described by the planckian distribution .",
    "we provide analytical formulae for the energy spectra of upscattered radiation , as well as for the interaction and the energy - loss rates of electrons .",
    "the `` threshold '' for the accuracy of these formulae in all cases has been set at the level of @xmath0 .",
    "the interaction of electrons with photons is described with the standard means of quantum electrodynamics . in the astrophysical context",
    ", the general expressions for the compton cross - section can be significantly simplified using the fact that the energy of the target photons is typically small , @xmath10 , and the electrons are relativistic , @xmath11 ( this condition , in particular , implies that the up - scattered photon moves in the direction of the initial velocity of the electron ) . under these circumstances , for the target photons with a fixed direction , the scattering rate by an electron moving with a velocity which makes an angle @xmath12 with the photon s direction has the following simple form @xcite : @xmath13\\ , , } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 are energies of electron , soft photon , and up - scattered photon , respectively ; @xmath16 is the electron classical radius ; and @xmath17 is number of target photons per unit of volume .",
    "if the target photon field is isotropic , the above expression should be averaged over the interaction angle @xcite : @xmath18\\ , , } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the klein - nishina parameter and the notation @xmath20 is used for logarithm to the base @xmath21 , i.e. `` natural logarithm '' .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : aa_iso ] ) has been originally derived by @xcite in a straight way , without using the intermediate angle - dependent rate given by equation  ( [ eq : aa_ani ] ) ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of black - body target photons , the scattering rates given by equations  ( [ eq : aa_ani ] ) and ( [ eq : aa_iso ] ) should be integrated over the planckian distribution of target photons : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dilution factor in the case of grey - body radiation .",

    "obviously , this is not a unique representation for the approximation function , but since @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the considered function family should preserve the asymptotic behavior of the zeroth - order fit @xmath80 and provide enough freedom for fitting .",

    "the obtained above approximations describe the ic spectra for two different , isotropic and mono - directional angular distributions of target photons .",
    "the former scenario with an involvement of cmbr is often realized in different objects like snrs , pwne , and clusters of galaxies .",

    "this approximation can be improved by using the correction function defined by equation  ( [ eq : correction ] ) . in particular , a set of the parameters @xmath136 provide a @xmath137 precision ( see figure  [ fig : losses ] ) .",
    "a similar expression ( although less optimized , with an accuracy of @xmath91 ) was originally presented in @xcite .    the obtained equation  ( [ eq : losses_ani_zero ] ) for @xmath125 and equations  ( [ eq : losses_iso_zero ]    [ eq : par_iso ] ) for @xmath131 allow a precise description of the energy losses with formulae equations  ( [ eq : losses_ani ] )  and  ( [ eq : losses_iso ] ) , which correspond to the case of electron - photon interactions at a specific angle and angle averaged , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that the latter can be realized also in the cases when the target photons are mono - directional in the source frame .",
    "for example , if particles are isotropized by the source magnetic field , the production of the ic emission towards the observer proceeds at a specific interaction angle , since relativistic particles emit within a narrow cone towards the direction of their motion .",
    "however , if ic cooling time exceeds particle isotropization timescale , each particle can interact with photons at an arbitrary angle , therefore particle losses are effectively determined by the interaction with an isotropic photon field , i.e. , by equation  ( [ eq : losses_iso ] ) .",
    "the particle cooling described by equation  ( [ eq : losses_ani ] ) can be realized , for example , in the so - called compton - drag scenarios , i.e. when the temperature of the emitting particles is very small and the bulk motion component is dominant . in particular , this may be relevant to the pulsar - wind zone for pulsars located in systems with bright stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also a similar situation can arise if ic cooling time is shorter than isotropization time - scale .",
    "often it is convenient to characterize the energy losses through the cooling - time : @xmath138 in the thomson limit , for the case of an isotropic photon field , this expression gives : @xmath139 where the middle term corresponds to the ratio of energy density of the black - body photon distribution to @xmath8 .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite and further generalized by @xcite that , in the case of an isotropic photon field , ic cooling time in the klein - nishina limit can be described by a simple function : @xmath140 where we transformed the numerical coefficient from equation  ( 13 ) in @xcite to the units used in this paper , and adopted a dilution coefficient to be @xmath141 .",

    "in order to simplify calculations , one may try to replace the relatively narrow planckian distribution by the @xmath9-function , or alternatively use a simplified description of the cross - section , e.g. , by the heaviside step function @xcite or simply by a @xmath9-function . for the sake of shortness , in what follows",
    "we discuss the @xmath9-functional approximation for a mono - directional target photon field , and the step function approximation by @xcite for the scattering off isotropic photon field .",
    "the @xmath9-functional approximation for target photons assumes the following photon field : @xmath204 it is easy to be convinced that for @xmath205 and @xmath206 one can reproduce correctly both the number and energy densities of the planckian photon field .",
    "however , to a certain extent , the choice of these parameters is arbitrary .    the substitution of equation  ( [ eq : ph_delta ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : bb_ic ] ) results in the following expression : @xmath207\\ds\\bigg[{z^2\\over2(1-z)}g_{1,\\delta}\\left(x_0\\right)+g_{2,\\delta}\\left(x_0\\right)\\bigg]\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath208 and @xmath209\\ds\\quad \\quad \\bigg(1-\\frac{2x_0}{\\omega_*/t}+\\frac{2x_0 ^ 2}{\\left(\\omega_*/t\\right)^2}\\bigg)\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] here @xmath210 is the heaviside step function .    the comparison of equations  ( [ eq : f1_delta ] )  and  ( [ eq : f_1 ] ) , and of equations  ( [ eq : f2_delta ] )  and  ( [ eq : f_2 ] ) , allows us to estimate the errors introduced by the @xmath9-functional approximation : ( 1 ) the lower energy part of the spectrum ( @xmath211 ) can be reproduced quite well if the selected parameters satisfy the condition @xmath212 ; ( 2 ) the accuracy declines significantly for the high energy part ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "the @xmath9-function imposes an artificial cutoff at @xmath214 . also the accuracy close to the cutoff appears to be quite poor .",
    "for example , the accuracy of the term @xmath215 can be estimated as @xmath216 which gives a factor of @xmath217 error for @xmath218 ( assuming that @xmath219 , as commonly adopted ) .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that for the cross section averaged over the interaction angle , the @xmath9-functional approximation gives a similar precision .",
    "it means that although a practical realization of the @xmath9-functional approximation is characterized by a similar complexity as the approach suggested in this paper , the accuracy provided by the @xmath9-functional approximation is very poor , especially in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "a more complicated approach has been suggested by @xcite for the case of the cross section averaged over the interaction angle . in this approach",
    "the ic cross section was approximated by a step function and integrated over the planckian photon distribution .",
    "this approximation , can be expressed as @xmath220\\ds\\bigg[{z^2\\over2(1-z)}g_{3,\\rm p}\\left(x_0\\right)+g_{4,\\rm p}\\left(x_0\\right)\\bigg]\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath221 and @xmath222 in figure  [ fig : petruk ] we compare the approximation of @xcite with precise numerical calculations , and arrive at a conclusion , similar to the statement of @xcite , that for certain parameters this approximation can not guaranty a precision better than @xmath223 ( we note that * ? ? ?",
    "* did not approximate the cross section in the region of the exponential tail , i.e. for @xmath224 ) .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested an analytical method to describe equations  ( [ eq : aa_ani ] )  and  ( [ eq : aa_iso ] ) based on the truncation of series , which describe the functions @xmath42 and @xmath225 . in figure",
    "[ fig : zdziarski ] we compare precise numerical calculations to the approximated values , @xmath226 and @xmath227 , that were obtained by substitution of equations  ( 7 ) , ( 8) , ( 14 ) , and ( 28 ) from @xcite ( the value of @xmath228 , as suggested by the authors , was adopted ) to equations  ( [ eq : f_3 ] )  and  ( [ eq : f_4 ] ) . since @xcite obtained analytical expressions for the functions",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath53 , the function @xmath226 is strictly equal to @xmath60 , which can be seen in figure  [ fig : zdziarski ] .",
    "the accuracy provided by the function @xmath227 is very high , at the level of @xmath229 achieved for the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is explained by the fact that these functions enter into the expression for the cross section with different signs , and the subtraction of these functions results in an overall error significantly exceeding the accuracy of the individual terms . ]",
    "( see figure  [ fig : zdziarski ] ) .",
    "the approach by @xcite can provide an arbitrary precision ( simply by increasing of the number the preserved terms in the series ) , however , in our view , it also owns a certain shortcoming .",
    "namely , this approach implies the usage of special functions ( dilogarithm and exponential integral ) , which may harden the practical usage .",
    "another important difference of our approach is that while in other studies one provides an approximate description for the cross section , we suggest an approach for a common description of all the relevant processes of ic scattering on the black - body photons : scattering rates , energy losses , cross sections and mean photon energy . also , all the approximations use the same type of correction function , equation  ( [ eq : correction ] )",
    "in this paper we suggest simple analytical presentations for calculations of different characteristics ( differential spectra , interaction rates , and energy losses ) of the ic scattering of relativistic electrons in the radiation field which is described by planckian distribution .",
    "two different types of angular distribution , namely mono - directional and isotropic distributions of the target radiation field have been considered .",
    "the obtained parameterizations are characterized by a high precision , of an order of @xmath0 , and cover the entire parameter space allowing an accurate description of the ic scattering in the thomson and klein - nishina limits , as well as in the transition region .",
    "the derived formulae preserve the precise asymptotic behavior and have similar structures , which simplifies their practical usage ( see table [ table : parameters ] ) .",
    "the main objective of the obtained approximate analytical presentations is the fast , but convenient and accurate calculations of characteristics of the upscattered ic emission in radiation fields described by planckian distribution . at the same time , the simple forms of these parameterizations allow derivation of some useful relations . in particular , we propose simple formulae which , for the given temperature of target photons , relate the mean energy of the electron and up - scattered photon .",
