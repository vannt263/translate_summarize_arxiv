    "the _ lateral line _ is a sensory system , which is present in fish and amphibians , that is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water and is involved in a large variety of behaviors , from prey detection to predator avoidance , school swimming and sexual courtship .",
    "it extends from the head to the tail along each flank of the fish , and it is formed by a set of sensory organs , the _ neuromasts _ , arranged on the body surface in specific patterns .",
    "the neuromasts , located between the ear and the eye , form the so - called anterior lateral line system ( all ) , while neuromasts on the body and tail form the _ posterior lateral line _ system ( pll ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose and analyze a mathematical model for the morphogenesis of the _ zebrafish _ ( _ danio rerio _ ) pll primordium .",
    "the development of this sensory organ represents a subject of general importance , as a paradigm to understand the growth , regeneration , and self - organization of other organ systems during development and disease @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have investigated migration and self - organization in the zebrafish lateral line system , where a complex system of receptor activation drives embryonic cells , rather than a guidance determined by birth .",
    "however , the complete mechanism for cells arranging and organization is still relatively poorly understood @xcite .    loosely speaking , lateral line formation consists in a group of mesenchymal cells that migrate driven by a haptotactic signal . in a second phase , a process of differentiation in the rear of the migrating group induces a mesenchymal - epithelial transition that is at the origin of the detachment of rosette - shaped structures .",
    "this corresponds to the growth and location of the neuromasts along the two flanks of the primordium ( see figure [ fig : gilmourzf ] ( a ) below , from @xcite ) .",
    "+    our aim is to obtain a minimal mathematical model which is able to :    a.   describe the collective cell migration , the formation and the detachment of the neuromasts , in the spatial and temporal scale of the experimental observations ; b.   ensure the existence and stability of the rosette structures of the emerging neuromasts , as stationary solutions of the system .",
    "request b ) , among other , allow us to obtain some important restrictions on the range of the values of some parameters of the model , which will be used in the numerical simulations of the dynamical case , other parameters being obtained from biological literature or by a numerical fitting .",
    "the model proposed here is a hybrid model : it describes cells as discrete entities and chemotactic molecules as continuous concentrations .",
    "this is a reasonable choice if we think that the total number of cells involved in the morphogenesis process is in the range 80100 @xcite . for analytical and computational simplicity in our analysis , here we consider only the 2d case , although we do not expect great changes passing to 3d , since experimental observations suggest that these phenomena involve only a thin cell layer . as we will see in more detail through numerical simulations given in section [ sec : dynamic ]",
    ", we can state that our mathematical model shows a substantial agreement with the biological observations and with the experimental data proposed in literature ( figure [ fig : gilmourzf ] ( b ) , to be compared with ( a ) ) .    from a mathematical point of view , our model is based on a second order equation of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , is the position vector of the @xmath3-th cell , @xmath4 is the total number of cells , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath7 includes several effects : from the detection of chemical signals @xmath8 ( chemotaxis , lateral inhibition ) to mutual interactions between cells ( alignment , adhesion , repulsion ) .",
    "all these effects take into account a non local sensing radius .",
    "in particular , we included an alignment term inspired by the cucker - smale mechanism @xcite , though in our case it is coupled with other effects .",
    "the term @xmath9 represents damping due to cell adhesion to the substrate .",
    "chemical signals are described using a reaction - diffusion equation @xmath10 with a possible source or degradation term given in @xmath11 .",
    "finally the cell mesenchymal - epithelial differentiation in the primordium is performed by a switch variable , whose evolution in time is given by a suitable threshold function .",
    "we will show that our model admits particular stationary solutions , biologically relevant and consistent with experimental observations .",
    "they correspond to the so called rosettes , that will form the future neuromasts .",
    "we investigate numerically their stability , finding in turn a nice agreement with biological evidences both in the stationary and in the dynamical setting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : bio ] we recall some biological backgrounds and the phenomenology , based on the existing experimental observations . in section [ sec : math : model ] the mathematical model is introduced and its main features are discussed . in section [ sec : steady ] we study the stationary configuration of the rosettes , and their stability . section [ sec : dynamic ] deals with the dynamic model .",
    "we explain the methods used in the numerical simulations and some 2d numerical tests are presented , with the aim of illustrating the power and the limits of our approach .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "finally , appendix [ ap : parameter ] contains the lists of main dimensional and nondimensional parameters used in the model .",
    "about zebrafish pll , recent studies and experimental observations @xcite show an initial elongated single group of cells in the otic vesicle , in which we can distinguish a _ trailing region _ near the head and a _ leading region _ oriented towards the future tail of the embryo . in the following few hours after the fertilization ,",
    "a total cell migration begins posteriorly , from head to tail .",
    "then the cells in the trailing region assemble into rosette structures ( proto - neuromast ) , that are progressively deposed during the migration to form _ neuromasts _",
    "@xcite ( see again figure [ fig : gilmourzf ] ( a ) ) .",
    "in general we can state two primary mechanisms that concur to this morphogenesis process : a collective migration , and the neuromasts assembly . about cell migration a very important role is played by chemokines as the _ stromal cell - derived factor-1a _ ( _ sdf-1a _ ) and its _ cxcr4b _ receptor @xcite . the former is expressed by the horizontal myoseptum , that separates the dorsal and ventral axial muscles , and acts as a haptotactic stripe for the migrating cells ; the latter is expressed by the primordium itself @xcite .",
    "chemokine signaling is necessary to drive migration .",
    "in fact , it has been proved that , in absence of cxcr4b , cell movements are strongly uncoordinated , with a `` zig zag '' pattern , as can be seen performing kymograph analysis ( see @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "next to the chemoattractant chemokine , migration within the primordium is guaranteed by a _ cell - cell interaction _ , exerted by an adhesion force via filopodia .",
    "this is confirmed by two observations in @xcite : first , cells lacking cxcr4b receptor , transplanted into wild - type primordium , preserve their migration through the contact with neighboring cells ; secondly , even a small number of wild - type cells , transplanted in a mutant primordium ( lacking the sdf-1a receptor ) , after moving themselves toward the leading edge can restore the collective migration . in this contest other studies @xcite have shown that intercellular adhesion , typically through molecules as the cadherins , and _ cell - substratum adhesion _ , through integrins , have a crucial role in the spatial organization of tissues and in embryonic development .",
    "integrin- and cadherin - mediated adhesion allows cells and tissues to respond to mechanical stimuli from their environment and to change shape without loosing integrity ( @xcite and references therein ) .    to understand the mechanism which drives the rosettes organization and neuromast deposition ( a mechanism however not yet completely described @xcite ) , we have to make some considerations .",
    "neuromast formation is strongly influences by the concentration of _ fibroblast growth factors _",
    "( _ fgfs _ ) and their receptors _ fgfrs _ @xcite . in zebrafishes ,",
    "fgf signaling drives cells to assemble rosettes and gives rise to the subdivision of the lateral line . among the 22 members of the fgf family , only fgf3 and fgf10 are expressed by the primordium @xcite , and they are substantially equivalent .",
    "in fact , inactivation of fgf3 or fgf10 alone does not alter significantly the development of the primordium , demonstrating a robustness of the system @xcite . on the other hand , using a fgfr inhibitor su5402 ,",
    "strongly affects the primordium : cells became disorganized and neuromast deposition stops . in this case",
    "also the collective migration is compromised , probably due to an alteration also in cxcr4b receptors @xcite .",
    "therefore , the rosette formation depends mainly on the total level of fgf and , as we will see below , on its location .",
    "we observe also that fgf and fgfr expressions are mutually exclusive , as confirmed by the location of their molecules : the former , broadly expressed in the leading region , and focused in one or two cells at the center of the rosettes in the trailing region , the latter , at the same time , expressed in the trailing region except the fgf foci @xcite . in the aim of designing a mathematical model",
    ", this suggests to divide the cell population into two groups : the _ leader _ mesenchymal cells ( expressing fgf ) , and the _ follower _ epithelial cells ( expressing fgfr ) . at the beginning , all the cells belong to the leading group .",
    "afterwards , few minutes after fertilization , some leaders in the trailing zone start to become followers , except one or two leader cells located in the center , that maintain their mesenchymal state .",
    "loss of fgf activity , on the contrary , implies that no transition can occurs @xcite .",
    "then , the follower cells are driven towards the fgf source to form a rosette .",
    "as a proto - neuromast becomes fully mature , it is deposited from the trailing edge , and a new rosette is formed again in a cyclic mechanism .",
    "let us now propose some rules that model the transition from a leader cell into a follower , corresponding to the activation of the fgfr receptor .",
    "we assume in the following that the transition occurs under three concomitant conditions :    1 .   a low level of sdf-1a @xcite ; 2 .   a high level of fgf @xcite ; 3 .   a low number of followers in the neighborhood .",
    "the first condition implies that rosette formation begins in the trailing region , where sdf-1a signal is already degraded by cells in the leading edge .",
    "the third condition translates a common phenomenon in embryology , the so called _ lateral inhibition _ : a cell that adopts a particular feature inhibits its immediate neighbours from doing likewise .",
    "this condition , together with the second , implies that followers , activating fgfr receptor , inhibit the same activation in a more surrounded central leader , so that it will express a significantly higher level of fgf signal @xcite .",
    "finally we remark that the leader - follower transition can be reversible , possibly with a time delay .",
    "in fact , blocking fgf activity makes all cells equally leader and causes the consequent melting of formed rosettes @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will see that our mathematical model will be consistent with the biological observations if we consider chemical effects concomitant with other cell mechanisms , as lateral inhibition , alignment , and adhesion - repulsion effects .",
    "according to the above observations we propose a hybrid model which takes into account the difference between the cellular and the chemical scale . at the cellular level",
    "the model is discrete and includes the equation of the motion and the equation of state leader - follower for each single cell , while at the molecular level the model is continuous and is based on the equations for the various chemical signals involved .",
    "let us summarize the main ingredients which compose our model .",
    "for the cell motion we use a second order dynamic equation , which takes into account the forces acting on the cells .",
    "these forces are given by chemical signals and mechanical interaction between cells .",
    "because of the equivalence between fgf3 and fgf10 , we consider a single concentration and a single receptor , that we will denote respectively as fgf and fgfr .",
    "the sdf-1a effect is described by a haptotactic term produced by the gradient of the concentration of this chemokine , see @xcite for some biological backgrounds , while mathematical references can be found in @xcite . in the same way , the action of fgfr on a follower cell is described by a chemotactic effect due to the gradient of the fgf produced by a leader cell .",
    "next we describe the cell - cell mechanical interactions due to filopodia , which consist in an alignment effect and both a radial attraction and repulsion depending on the relative position of the cells , see @xcite for experimental results in this direction . about alignment effects",
    ", we base our description on the seminal paper by f. cucker and s. smale @xcite , while for the attraction - repulsion effects we refer to the mechanism introduced by dorsogna et al . @xcite ; both effects are considered by @xcite .",
    "finally , we introduce a damping term , proportional to the velocities , which models cell adhesion to the substrate @xcite .",
    "the follower - leader differentiation is represented mathematically by a switch state variable , which change its value according to the level of some related functions , which take into account the concentration of sdf-1a and of fgf and also the number of cells in a given neighborhood of the given cell .    about the concentration of the fgf signal we associate a diffusion equation including a source term , given by the fgf production of the leader cells , and a natural molecular degradation term .",
    "the concentration of sdf-1a is described by an equation involving its degradation during the haptotactic process .",
    "starting from the above considerations , we start to work in the following framework :    let @xmath12 be the position of a single @xmath3-th cell , @xmath13 the sdf-1a concentration , @xmath14 the total fgf concentration ( including both fgf3 and fgf10 ) , @xmath15 a variable that distinguishes a @xmath3-th cell to be , at time @xmath16 , a leader ( @xmath17 ) or a follower ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "a similar definition holds for the vector quantity @xmath41 .",
    "reasonably we will choose @xmath35 larger than the cell radius @xmath42 ( see appendix [ ap : parameter ] ) , so ( [ f_chemicals ] ) describes a chemical signal that is sensed more in the center of the cell and less at the edge of the cell extensions . the second addend in ( [ sysf])@xmath43 refers to the attraction of a follower cell toward a source of fgf ligand .",
    "the switch variable @xmath44 makes this term zero for a leader cell that , expressing fgf , does not activate fgfr receptor ( see section [ sec : bio ] ) .    the effect included in the third addend of (",
    "[ sysf])@xmath43 represents a possible cell alignment . for it",
    "we assume a cucker - smale _ flocking term _ :",
    "@xmath45 here @xmath46 is a suitable radius of influence , @xmath47 and the function @xmath48 depends on the relative velocities @xmath49 , i.e. : @xmath50\\frac{r_1 ^ 2}{r_1 ^ 2+||\\mathbf{x}_j-\\mathbf{x}_i||^2}(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_j-\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_i),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 , @xmath52 being constants . in particular we can have different coefficient of alignment for a leader or follower cell : the product @xmath53 makes the coefficient equal to @xmath51 if at least one of the two cell is follower ( @xmath54 ) and equal to @xmath52 in the case of two leaders ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we remark that the flocking term given by ( [ alignment2 ] ) , which is studied in @xcite , in our model is coupled with other effects , as chemotaxis and attraction - repulsion effects ( see below ) , and it is also computed on a truncated domain . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath56 ( see appendix [ ap : parameter ] ) , but in principle they can be different .",
    "function @xmath57 includes adhesion - repulsion effects .",
    "in particular repulsion occurs at a distance between the centers of two cells less than @xmath58 and takes into account the effects of a possible cell deformation .",
    "conversely , adhesion occurs at a distance greater than @xmath58 and less than @xmath59 , and it is due to a mechanical interaction between cells via filopodia .",

    "in practice we will choose @xmath67 ( see appendix [ ap : parameter ] ) , so that repulsion occurs when two cells start to be effectively overlapped .",

    "in particular we have @xmath66 if at least one of the two cells is a follower ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath71 if two cells are both leader ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "similar terms can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we remark that adhesion ( [ kappa])@xmath70 and alignment ( [ alignment2 ] ) produce different effects , though they both refer to a cell - cell interaction : the former a radial effect , the latter a tangential effect .    the last term in the first equation is due to the cell adhesion to the substrate ( see for example @xcite ) , possibly with a different damping coefficient for a leader ( @xmath22 , given by @xmath72 ) or a follower cell ( @xmath23 , given by @xmath73 ) .",

    "the leader - to - follower transition is performed requiring that the threshold function at the right hand side of ( [ sysf])@xmath70 is less than zero , according with the three conditions described in section [ sec : bio ] . for the fgf detection in @xmath74",
    "we choose the following form for the function @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is constant .",
    "the function ( [ fun - fgf - fgfmax ] ) includes a possible saturation effect when fgf molecules tend to occupy all receptors of a cell . the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 , related respectively to a leader and a follower cell , provides a delay in the inverse follower - to - leader transition setting suitably @xmath78 , this in accordance to observations in section [ sec : bio ] . about the lateral inhibition mechanism ,",
    "we introduce a function @xmath79 that counts the number @xmath80 of cells in a suitable neighborhood of the @xmath3-th cell , with radius of influence @xmath81 , namely @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xmath84 is a constant , and @xmath85 is the interior of @xmath86 .",
    "function ( [ gamma - n - i ] ) is justified if we think of a neuromast as made by a single central leader and some followers around . in this contest",
    "it makes an appropriate difference between the number of cells counted by the central cell and those counted by a lateral cell .",
    "moreover , it provides a fast saturation effect when @xmath87 increases , so that a central leader counts about the same number of cells from a certain value of @xmath87 .",
    "this is useful to describe the possibility to obtain neuromasts with a variable number of cells , according to experimental observations ( generally 8 - 20 cells ) @xcite . a suitable value for the constant @xmath84 is given in appendix [ ap : parameter ] .    in the diffusion equation ( [ sysf])@xmath88 , only leader cells are responsible of the production of fgf , so that @xmath89 where @xmath4 is the total number of cells , and @xmath90    similarly , in equation ( [ sysf])@xmath91 we take @xmath92 in which the variable @xmath93 does not appear now , because both leaders and followers are involved in the haptotactic process . typically , we will choose @xmath94 considering that the source of fgf and the degradation of sdf-1a signal is substantially defined by the dimension of a single cell ( see appendix [ ap : parameter ] )",
