    "numerous experiments on the @xmath1-axis transport in layered high-@xmath2 superconductors ( hts ) justify the use of a model in which the superconducting cuo@xmath3 layers are coupled , through the block layers , by the intrinsic josephson effect .",
    "the josephson current flowing along the @xmath1-axis is coupled with the electromagnetic field inside the insulating dielectric layers , thereby causing a specific kind of elementary excitations called josephson plasma waves ( jpws ) ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "in other words , the layered structure of bi - based superconductors and related compounds favors the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the layers .",
    "these waves are of considerable interest because of their terahertz ( thz ) and sub - thz frequency ranges , which are still hardly reachable for both electronic and optical devices .",
    "the frequencies of terahertz waves are in the region of resonance frequencies of molecules and are expected to have many applications .",
    "the unusual optical properties of layered superconductors , including their reflectivity and transmissivity , caused by the jpws excitation , were studied , e.g. , in ref .  .",

    "recently , the existence of sjpws in layered superconductors in the thz frequency range was predicted  @xcite .",
    "surface waves play an important role in many fundamental resonance optics phenomena  @xcite , such as the wood s anomalies in reflectivity  @xcite and transmissivity  @xcite of periodically - corrugated metal samples .",

    "therefore , it is essential to study similar resonance phenomena caused by the excitation of surface waves in layered superconductors .",
    "the dispersion curve , @xmath7 , of the surface waves lies below the `` vacuum light line '' , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the wave - number and @xmath10 is the speed of light .",
    "this means that the surface waves have wave - vectors greater than the wave - vectors of light of the same frequency in vacuum .",

    "the nonlinear equations can be linearized , i.e. , @xmath60 can be replaced by @xmath61 .",
    "we also assume that the gauge - invariant phase difference experiences small changes , @xmath62 , and thus we can use the continuum approach , replacing @xmath63 by @xmath64 . then yields @xmath65    the magnetic and electric fields are related to the gauge invariant phase difference as @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the flux quantum and @xmath69 is the elementary charge .",
