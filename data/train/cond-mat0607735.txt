    "a basic problem in the physics of finite fermion systems such as , e.g. , atoms , nuclei , helium clusters , metal clusters , or semiconductor quantum dots , is the determination of the ground - state energy @xmath1 .",
    "a standard decomposition , deeply rooted in the connection of classical and quantum physics , is to write @xmath1 as the sum of an average energy @xmath2 and a fluctuating part @xmath3 @xcite : @xmath4 the largest contribution , @xmath2 , is a smooth function of the number @xmath0 of fermions .",
    "the shell correction @xmath3 has a pure quantal origin and displays , instead , an oscillatory behavior as a function of @xmath0 .    equation ( [ eq1 ] ) underlies the usefulness of the so - called mass formulae , like the liquid drop model for nuclei or for metal clusters , of which the oldest example is the well - known bethe - von weizscker mass formula for the binding energy of nuclei .",
    "the decomposition ( [ eq1 ] ) is also at the basis of semiclassical and statistical techniques that are used to investigate how the properties of global character of fermion systems vary with the particle number @xmath0 .",
    "such is the case for instance of the celebrated thomas - fermi and wigner - kirkwood theories @xcite .",
    "these methods often provide deep physical insights which may be otherwise obscured behind a full quantum calculation .",
    "it is recognized , however , that the semiclassical calculations of @xmath5 for fermion systems in either external potentials or self - consistent mean fields show systematic deviations with respect to the actual average of the exact quantum results @xcite .",
    "for example , in spherically symmetric calculations one finds that , as a function of the number @xmath0 of particles , the difference @xmath6 between the ( fluctuating ) exact value @xmath7 and the ( smooth ) semiclassical average @xmath5 _ does not _",
    "oscillate around zero .",
    "in general , for fermions in a fixed external potential , semiclassical calculations overbind the true average of the quantum energy .",
    "one of our purposes in the present work is to explain the origin of this effect , and to derive an explicit formula that allows to compute the correct average behavior of @xmath7 in fermion systems .",
    "related studies are the works of refs .",
    "@xcite where a particle number conserving shell correction method has been pursued .",
    "additional contributions to the average part of the ground - state energy come in fact from a careful analysis of the oscillatory term @xmath8 .",
    "because this fluctuating function is evaluated at discrete values of the chemical potential ( that correspond to integer values of the particle number ) , its average value is generically non - zero and therefore contributes to the average part of @xmath9 .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the different physical descriptions of quantum mechanical systems obtained from different thermodynamic ensembles , the grand canonical and the canonical in the present context .",
    "this subtle topic has played , in recent years , a crucial role in understanding the physics of , e.g. , persistent currents in mesoscopic metallic rings @xcite , or in trapped bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "our results are illustrated with two schematic models .",
    "namely , we study the average of @xmath9 for fermions in a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential , via the semiclassical wigner - kirkwood ( wk ) theory @xcite , and for fermions in a spherical cavity with sharp boundaries , via the weyl expansion @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "analytical expressions are available . finally , and in contrast to the previous examples where the confining potential is fixed , we consider the influence of deformations and self - consistency on the average behavior of @xmath9 , as well as other related topics .",
    "we find that for self - consistent potentials with deformation degrees of freedom the behavior of the average energy is qualitatively different .",

    "for instance , the ground - state energy @xmath9 of the system consists in the sum of the single - particle energies of the @xmath0 lowest single - particle states ( taking into account spin - degeneracy ) . thus eqs.([eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) are related to the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the function @xmath7 as a function of @xmath0 is in general quite different from the behavior of @xmath23 .    based on e.g.  the wigner - kirkwood method , the usual way to calculate the function @xmath7 is as follows",

    "there is , however , a systematic deviation in the sense that the wk curve does not pass as a function of @xmath0 through the average of the quantum values .",
    "this is clearly seen from the large asymmetry of the shaded regions above and below the wk curve in the upper panel of fig .",

    "these values do not occur at random .",
    "for instance , for an even number of particles and non - degenerate single - particle states , a standard rule is to locate the chemical potential half - way between the last occupied and the first unoccupied single - particle states . fixing a particular rule to determine the chemical potential at a given number of particles introduces a bias in the sampling of the values of @xmath13 ( with respect to a uniform , random distribution of @xmath13 ) . due to this bias , when the oscillatory part of the energy @xmath35 is evaluated over the set of discrete points it produces , generically , a function whose",

    "the decomposition of the single - particle level density into a smooth part and a fluctuating part , @xmath51 where @xmath18 is the wk ( or weyl ) smooth part and @xmath52 is given by the sum over periodic orbits mentioned above @xcite , induces a corresponding decomposition of the integrated density [ cf eq .",

    "in contrast , when symmetries are broken shell effects are smaller , and the exact energies ( and not only their average part ) are better described by the wk theory .",
    "the description of the behavior of self - bound systems is more difficult and subtle , because at each particle number @xmath0 the energy is minimised , and hence the shape of the potential is a function of @xmath0 . in this case , a shell correction which is nearly always negative with respect to the spherical wk result is observed for the ho potential . in between shells , when the system deforms and symmetries are broken , the value of the shell correction is smaller , and the energy is well approximated by the wk theory , in agreement with the general considerations that follow from eq .",
