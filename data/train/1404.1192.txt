    "entangled photons are a primary source for studying the properties of entanglement @xcite .",
    "they allow to perform fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite and to implement protocols which could not be realized within the framework of classical physics .",
    "these cover quantum cryptography @xcite and more generally , quantum communication @xcite and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "applications like quantum imaging @xcite or quantum optical coherence tomography @xcite revealed the potential of entangled photons to exceed classical resolution limits .",
    "the most common sources for entangled two - photon states are based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) occurring in nonlinear crystals @xcite .",
    "this process allows to create entanglement with respect to polarization @xcite , angular orbital momentum @xcite , momentum @xcite or energy @xcite .",
    "energy entanglement appears due to strong quantum correlations between the frequencies of the individual photons in a pair .",
    "some applications require the spectrum of the individual photons to be broad @xcite .",
    "for instance , a broad spectrum allows to achieve a high axial resolution in quantum optical coherence tomography @xcite and the temporal properties of entangled photons can be measured with a spatial light modulator @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the maximal flux of down - converted photons in the single photon regime is limited by the bandwidth of the entangled photon spectrum @xcite .",
    "in general , the interplay between the energy and momentum degrees of freedom within a two - photon state shows a complex spatiotemporal structure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "therefore , a detailed understanding of the spdc process , as well as an accurate characterization of the down - converted spectrum is important .",
    "the joint spectrum of photon pairs has been measured for @xcite and for spdc @xcite .",
    "the spdc spectrum as a function of the pump waist is investigated in @xcite and its transverse momentum dependency has been measured in the high gain regime @xcite .",
    "coherence properties of the down - converted beam are investigated in @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we study both theoretically and experimentally the full dependency of the type-0 spdc spectrum on the transverse momentum @xcite for a monochromatic pump focused into a periodically poled crystal in the single photon regime .",
    "in the first part we theoretically describe the spectrum generated by spdc and we identify in particular four parameters which determine the spectrum .",
    "we present an experimental setup which allows to measure the tuning curves , i.e.  the transverse momentum and frequency dependency of the spdc emission , with respect to three of these parameters .",
    "finally , we compare experimental results with numerical simulations .",
    "quasi - phase - matched ( qpm ) parametric amplification has been computed in @xcite . in the low gain regime the entangled two - photon state",

    "the photon creation operator is denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the temperature dependent spectral amplitude function .",
    "apart from the vacuum permittivity @xmath14 and the reduced planck constant @xmath15 , the strength of the spdc process is governed by the second order susceptibility @xmath16 and the length @xmath17 of the nonlinear crystal .",
    "dispersion properties are included through a frequency and temperature dependent refractive index @xmath18 where we neglect its transverse wave vector dependencies .",
    "the phase mismatch    @xmath19    is compensated by a judicious choice of the poling period @xmath20 such that    @xmath21    the normalization function    @xmath22    originates from the field operator    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the speed of light in vacuum . the symmetry in with respect to and causes the indistinguishability of signal and idler spectra .",
    "therefore , the total spectrum measured by a spectrometer can be considered to be proportional to the signal spectrum .",
    "glauber s first order correlation function for the signal photon without the normalization function in the field operators @xcite    @xmath25    is proportional to the probability of measuring a photon with @xmath26 and @xmath7 on a plane at the position @xmath27 , i.e.  a momentum dependent spectral photon count density , henceforth referred to as spectral density at @xmath27 .",
    "the operator is the partial trace over the idler subsystem of the density operator .",

    "a pump power of 5  w is focused by a lens @xmath42 with either or into a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal where spdc generates entangled photons centered around @xmath43  nm . the down - converted photon power is measured to be linear to the pump power and around @xmath44  nw ( parameter dependent ) which correspond to a flux of . according to @xcite the maximal flux of down - converted photons @xmath45 that can still be considered as composed of distinct photon pairs is approximately the down - converted bandwidth @xmath46 which is in our case greater than .",
    "this leads to an experimental spectral mode density @xmath47 which confirms the single photon limit and legitimate the quantum mechanical description of our experiment .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 can be varied by changing the focal length @xmath48 .",
    "the spdc source is mounted in a copper block whose temperature is controlled to @xmath49  @xmath50c .",
    "heat transfer between copper and ppktp is ensured by wrapping the crystal with an indium foil . due to the low absorption coefficient of ktp at @xmath51 ,",
    "the temperature gradient between the location of the absorbed pump power within the crystal and the crystal surface is negligible as simulations have shown .",
    "therefore , the measured parameter @xmath32 of the copper block can be considered to be equal to the effective temperature of the crystal .",
    "two different crystals are used to analyze the effect on eq .   of different lengths @xmath33 .",
    "the pump beam is filtered out by two dichroic mirrors ( dm1&2 ) oriented such that the beam displacement is compensated .",
    "the wave vector - dependent spectrum is measured by raster - scanning a multi - mode fiber along the x - axis of a 2f imaging system with a lens @xmath52 of focal length .",
    "the fiber position @xmath53 is related to the transverse momentum by @xmath54 . since @xmath55 it is sufficient to scan the fiber along the x - axis .",
    "the direction of the remaining light from the pump beam after the two dichroic mirrors defines the optical axis and is used to align the fiber .",
    "the fiber is subsequently coupled into an optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) with dynamic range .",
    "two typical spectral densities are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinc ] ( a ) and ( b ) for different fiber positions .",

    "the finite resolution smooths out the sinc structure given by eq .  .",
    "however for mostly collinear but non - degenerated cases the sinc structure is visible when measuring the total spectral density by replacing the fiber by a collimator as shown in fig .",

    "in the following the influence of the four parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is investigated independently .",

    "follows that spectral components propagate in different directions , giving rise to the x - shaped structure and thus colored emission rings .",
    "the emission angle relative to the optical axis can be calculated from @xmath64 and @xmath63 by @xmath65 , which implies a larger emission angle for the photon with lower frequency .",
    "a change of @xmath60 affects the phase matching condition in eq .   which leads to another propagation direction for the different spectral components .",
    "for very few photons propagate parallel to the optical axis , but most of the photons have frequency @xmath66 , corresponding to a non - collinear but degenerate emission . with a slightly longer poling period ( )",
    "the emission probability favors the collinear case and the overall down - conversion efficiency increases . for even longer poling periods ( )",
    "the emission still favors the collinear case , however , becomes ; thus a gap at @xmath62 in the total spectrum can be observed .",
    "further enhancement of @xmath60 broadens the gap and leads to additional local maxima inside the gap due to the sinc in eq .  .",

    "the width of the branches illustrates that , if the pump beam is focused more tightly , each frequency is generated over a broader @xmath67-range . for the utilized crystal we get best agreements between simulation and measurement for @xmath68 m. all numerical and experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam waist ] are normalized to their maximum value since the fiber coupling efficiency varies for both measurements .",
    "in fact , the measured signal decreases with a bigger beam waist since @xmath31 appears in the exponent in eq .  .",
    "if the beam waist is too small the spdc efficiency would decrease again since the beam divergence increases .",
    "the slight asymmetry in the width of the branches with respect to a line at @xmath62 is visible in both simulation and measurement and is again due to the frequency dependent refractive index .",

    "due to thermal expansion , @xmath30 elongates about and therefore contributes only 3% to changes in the phase matching condition ( eq .  ) .",

    "the measurements for two crystals from the same manufacturer and with same nominal poling period @xmath60 but of different lengths indicate a clear difference in @xmath73 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : length ] .",
    "in contrast , the simulations indicate that a change in length only could not cause the emission to change from collinear to non - collinear as measured , but has merely the effect of narrowing the spectrum . the discrepancy in the measurement",

    "we further have characterized how different parameters influence the spectrum and we reported good agreement between measurement and simulated data .",
    "it turned out that the spectrum itself is most sensitive to the crystals poling period @xmath60 .",
    "a change in the nm - range causes different emission . in practice , due to the equivalent behavior of the spectral density when changing the temperature @xmath32 or @xmath60 , the discrepancy between the nominal and effective poling periods can be compensated by temperature tuning .",

    "moreover , we have noticed that , apart from the total spdc efficiency , changes of the pump waist or of the crystal length do not influence critically the emission spectra .",
