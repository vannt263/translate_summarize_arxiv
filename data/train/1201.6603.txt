    "major experimental efforts seek to detect dm particles via direct , indirect and collider searches .",
    "these experiments provide complementary information on the properties of dm such as its mass , elastic scattering cross section with nucleons , annihilation cross section , and annihilation channels .",
    "indirect searches investigate annihilation of dm to various final states ( neutrinos , photons , charged particles ) through astrophysical observations .",
    "neutrinos provide an especially interesting probe because they are least affected on their way from the production point to the detection point . as a result",
    ", neutrino telescopes like icecube / deepcore ( ic / dc ) can trace a neutrino signal directly back to the source .",
    "dm particles gravitationally captured inside the sun annihilate and produce such a signal .",
    "when equilibrium between dm capture by the sun and dm annihilation inside the sun is established , the flux of produced neutrinos depends on the dm mass , scattering cross section off nucleons and the annihilation spectrum .",
    "the dm mass and scattering cross section can be independently determined from other experiments .",
    "in particular , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is on the verge of discovering new physics , which will enable us to measure the mass of the dm particle .",
    "therefore , using the lhc measurements and the ic / dc results in tandem , we hope to identify the annihilation channels and their corresponding branching ratios .    in this paper , we study the prospects for determining dm annihilation final states with ic / dc .",
    "this model - independent study has two goals : 1 ) distinguishing scenarios in which dm annihilates into neutrinos from scenarios where dm annihilates into gauge bosons and charged leptons , and 2 ) extracting information about flavor composition of neutrino final states in the former case .",
    "gauge boson and charged fermion final states are the dominant annihilation channels for the popular and extensively studied neutralino dm in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . on the other hand , annihilation",
    "to neutrinos can arise as the dominant channel in extensions of the standard model ( sm ) in which dm is related to the neutrino sector .",
    "discriminating neutrino final states from gauge boson and tau final states will therefore allow us to discern between the two large classes of dm models . in the case that dm mainly annihilates into neutrinos",
    ", it will be important to also know the flavor composition of the final state neutrinos .",
    "this will shed further light on the specific aspects of the model that connect dm to neutrinos .",
    "we show that the contained muon tracks at neutrino telescopes like ic / dc may be used for both purposes .",
    "the spectrum of contained muons can be used to determine the branching ratios of neutrino final states versus gauge boson and tau final states .",
    "we demonstrate this for several points in the parameter space within the reach of the one - year sensitivity limits of the ic / dc array , with the background from atmospheric neutrinos and the experimental error in energy reconstruction of the muons taken into account .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 regeneration due to charged current interactions inside the sun may be used to extract information about the flavor of final state neutrinos for dm masses above 300 gev . in particular , we see that the @xmath0 final state can be discriminated from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 final states at a significant level for dm masses as heavy as 800 gev . distinguishing the neutrino final states and discriminating the flavor of neutrinos",

    "dm annihilation in the sun produces a neutrino flux that can be probed by neutrino telescopes like ic / dc .",
    "this neutrino flux is modeled by calculating the number of gravitationally captured dm particles in the sun and then considering the propagation and detection of the neutrinos produced in dm annihilation .",
    "the number of captured dm particles as a function of time is governed by a differential equation that balances the capture of particles from elastic scattering on nucleons with the annihilation rate .",
    "the total rate of annihilation in the sun is * given by  @xcite ( also see  @xcite ) * @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the capture rate of dm particles .",
    "the number of particles captured will saturate at @xmath5 as long as the length of time for the process has exceeded the equilibration time , @xmath6 .    with a nominal freeze - out annihilation rate of @xmath7 @xmath8 ,",
    "dm readily achieves equilibrium within the lifetime of the solar system , @xmath9 gyr , for spin - independent elastic scattering cross sections compatible with the limits set by the xenon100 experiment : @xmath10 for the mass range @xmath11 tev  @xcite . the spin - dependent cross section needed to reach equilibrium",
    "is larger by a factor of about @xmath12  @xcite , which is well below the current experimental limit of @xmath13 for the @xmath14 mass range  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the equilibrium constraints on @xmath15 and @xmath16 comes from the fact that @xmath17 * while @xmath18 * ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the mass and spin of target nuclei inside the sun respectively",
    ". heavy elements such as iron account for only a thousandth of the sun s mass and suffer a two order of magnitude form - factor suppression in capturing wimp - scale dm masses  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", hydrogen dominates the sun s composition and does not suffer a form factor suppression .",
    "thus , the ratio of the spin - independent contribution from iron to the spin - dependent contribution from hydrogen is on the order of @xmath21 .",
    "since equilibrium is easily achieved in the sun , the neutrino signal will depend solely on @xmath4 , or equivalently @xmath22 and/or @xmath23 .",
    "once neutrinos are produced from dm annihilation in the sun , their spectra undergo a number of changes before detection . scattering via neutral current interactions results in neutrino energy loss , while charged current interactions result in absorption of neutrinos .",
    "these effects are proportional to the energy of the neutrino and will therefore have the greatest effect on the high energy part of the spectrum .",
    "neutrinos are also affected by oscillations on the way to the earth .",
    "since the oscillation length is proportional to energy , @xmath24 , the effect is more important for the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "neutrino telescopes access the neutrino signal from dm annihilation by recording cerenkov light from relativistic charged particles in their volume .",
    "muon neutrinos produce muons via charged current interactions in the detector .",
    "cosmic ray showers create a muon background that can be controlled by selecting for upward - going events since muons are stopped in the earth .",
    "this limits observation of a dm signal from the sun to half the year , when the sun is below the horizon . to @xmath25 inside the instrumented volume , as in the case of ic / dc .",
    "the veto procedure virtually eliminates the contribution to the background from through - going atmospheric muons by selecting for contained vertices .",
    "this increases the potential observation time to the full year when the sun is both above and below the horizon . ] with through - going muons eliminated as a background , the most significant contribution to the remaining background comes from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the spectrum of the atmospheric neutrino background from cosmic rays is understood theoretically to within @xmath26  @xcite and is measured above 100 gev to within @xmath27  @xcite , but individual atmospheric neutrino events can not be distinguished from neutrinos from dm annihilation",
    ".    the dm neutrino signal can be further enhanced over the background by allowing for an angular cut in the direction of the sun .",
    "the cut will be made on the muon track , and not the incoming neutrino .",
    "a smaller angle between the track and incident neutrino occurs for muons with an energy closer to that of the neutrino . for an elastic collision ,",
    "the dependence of the angle @xmath28 on the muon energy @xmath29 angle is approximately given by @xmath30 ( for example , see  @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the muon events that deflect little from the incoming neutrino path are the highest energy events . while the smallest possible angular cut is desirable to eliminate background , more accommodating cuts on the angle between the track and the sun provide information about lower energy events .",
    "energy reconstruction of events can be approximated in two regimes . above @xmath31 ,",
    "the light generated by an event is proportional to the muon energy since bremsstrahlung radiation , nuclear interactions and pair production create charged particles each of which contribute to the cerenkov radiation .",
    "energy reconstruction in this regime will be logarithmic in energy with an error of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , below @xmath33 the length of the track is proportional to the energy of the incident particle since the majority of energy loss in this range is governed by ionization . in this case reconstruction will likely be more accurate for contained tracks , and reconstruction algorithms are currently in development  @xcite . events between these regimes call for a more complicated reconstruction algorithm .",
    "whereas the ic design is focused on event energies above a tev , ic / dc achieves an energy threshold as low as 10 gev .",
    "ic / dc consists of eight more densely instrumented strings with high quantum - efficiency digital optical modules ( doms ) . surrounding ic / dc strings veto through - going muons so ic / dc records muon - neutrino vertex events inside its volume . ic / dc increases the ic effective volume at energies below 65 gev and accounts for the majority of events recorded below 100 gev .",
    "further infills of the ic / dc array , such as pingu , could extend the energy threshold to a few gev and further increase the effective volume by a factor of two at 10 gev  @xcite .",
    "dm particles can in principle annihilate into any of the sm particles .",

    "annihilation of neutralino dm typically yields secondary neutrinos from @xmath40 and tau final states .",
    "the neutrino signal that is produced from neutralino annihilaiton inside the sun has been studied in various cases  @xcite . because of the existence of charged particles in the final state , annihilation of neutralino dm also results in a gamma - ray signal .",
    "this implies that one can also obtain constraints by using data from the fermi gamma - ray space telescope  @xcite .",
    "neutralino annihilation to primary neutrinos happens via gauge interactions where neutrinos are produced through the @xmath42 vertex .",
    "it therefore produces a left - handed ( lh ) neutrino and a right - handed ( rh ) antineutrino . considering that the neutralino is a majorana fermion ,",
    "the @xmath36-wave contribution to such a final state is extremely small due to the tiny masses of neutrinos .",
    "we note that the @xmath37-wave contribution to neutrino final states is also very small because of velocity suppression . in consequence ,",
    "production of primary neutrinos with a hard spectrum from neutralino annihilation is highly suppressed .",
    "however , it is possible to enhance dm annihilation into primary neutrinos by going beyond neutralino dm .",
    "if dm annihilation produces a @xmath43 pair , instead of a @xmath44 pair , it can proceed in the @xmath36-wave without any mass suppression .",
    "a detailed analysis of settings in which dm annihilation into neutrinos is enhanced has been given in  @xcite .",
    "this can happen when dm is related to the neutrino sector ( for some specific models , see  @xcite ) .",

    "a minimal extension of the sm gauge group , motivated by the nonzero neutrino masses , includes a gauged @xmath48 gauge symmetry  @xcite .",

    "the sneutrinos can annihilate in the @xmath36-wave to rh neutrinos , which in turn decay to lh neutrinos and the sm higgs .",
    "the energy of the resulting neutrinos will be close to monochromatic as long as the difference between the masses of the rh sneutrino and rh neutrino is much less than the rh sneutrino mass .",

    "significant dm annihilation to taus is also possible  @xcite ( also see  @xcite ) , which could provide an explanation for the positron excess in the cosmic rays reported by pamela  @xcite .",

    "]    the neutrino signal is the main channel of indirect searches for models with dm annihilation to primary neutrinos .",
    "these models result in a highly suppressed gamma - ray signal , which escapes the bounds set by fermi  @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that neutrinos from dm annihilation in the galactic center provide complementary information to those from annihilation inside the sun : the former constrains the dm annihilation cross section  @xcite , while the latter bounds the dm scattering cross section off nucleons  @xcite .",

    "we investigate only annihilation to @xmath52 s for the following reasons .",
    "@xmath53 s and @xmath25 s are stopped immediately in the sun , so @xmath25 decay will occur at low energy and result in a very soft spectrum . when dm annihilation produces quarks , all quarks except the @xmath41-quark hadronize before their subsequent decay .",

    "the quark the longer it will take to decay , and hence the lower its energy will be .",
    "the @xmath54-quark produces neutrinos via three - body decay , which has a softer spectrum than that from @xmath52 .",
    "all other quarks decay effectively at rest and have unmeasurable spectra at low energies that can not compete with the atmospheric background  @xcite .    with regard to gauge boson final states , @xmath40 and @xmath55 spectra are relatively similar ; we consider only @xmath40 final states in our analysis .",
    "finally , the higgs boson final states also result in a soft neutrino spectrum that is negligible compared to that from @xmath40 and @xmath52 final states .",
    "the higgs mainly decays to @xmath54-quarks , thus yielding a neutrino spectrum similar to that from the @xmath54-quark final state .    in the following ,",
    "we therefore focus on secondary neutrinos from dm annihilation to @xmath40 and @xmath52 final states vs primary neutrinos and their corresponding spectra .",
    "previous investigations have shown that measuring the spectrum can allow the reconstruction of the dm mass and its annihilation branching ratios  @xcite ( also see  @xcite for reconstructing dm properties , and  @xcite for the signature of primary neutrinos ) .",
    "we perform an analysis for reconstructing the dm elastic scattering cross section and its annihilation channels , including experimental error in energy reconstruction and assuming that its mass can be determined from other experiments ( notably by the lhc ) .      in this analysis",
    ", we consider the spectrum of contained muon tracks so that the vertex at which @xmath1 is converted to a @xmath25 is within the detector volume .",
    "hadronic and electromagnetic cascade events in the ice also carry useful information about low energy neutrinos and may show tau neutrino appearance from oscillations  @xcite .",
    "ic / dc is uniquely suited to measure these low energy events and recently confirmed the observation of neutrino - induced cascades  @xcite . for our purposes , since cascades are localized in the ice and thus suffer from an angular resolution of about @xmath56 degrees at @xmath57 gev , too much background is admitted to perform a meaningful dm search with cascades  @xcite .",
    "we use darksusy to calculate the spectrum for any given final state  @xcite . to the extent that the energy of the event may be well reconstructed in this range",
    ", we also assume that the muon track itself is fully contained , ending inside the detector .",
    "we do not account for any loss of events or poor energy reconstruction at the edges of the fiducial volume .",

    "[ fig:1 ] depicts the theoretical prediction for neutrino and muon spectra that result from the annihilation of @xmath57 gev dm particles in the sun to prompt @xmath1 s , @xmath40 s and @xmath52 s .",
    "the flux is given in events per km@xmath58 effective volume of the detector at earth per year .",
    "only a half - year of data is taken for each calendar year , since we assume the neutrino telescope requires the sun to be below the horizon to observe the dm neutrino signal above the atmospheric muon background .",

    "the contained muon spectrum is plotted along with the neutrino spectrum to emphasize the effect of the charged current conversion of neutrinos to muons .",

    "an important point to note is that @xmath40 s with transverse polarization can dominate the annihilation final state as happens , for example , in the case of neutralino dm .",
    "the main contribution to hard neutrinos ( with an energy close to the upper kinematic cut off mentioned above ) comes from transverse @xmath40 s in this case , which will become totally dominant when @xmath66 . in these cases , it is therefore important to carry out a spin - dependent calculation that accounts for spin correlations of the final state particles and the helicity - dependence of their decays  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the upper kinematic cut off itself gets closer to @xmath67 , and thus creates a harder neutrino spectrum , when @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath52 s produce neutrinos via three - body decays , which results in a much softer neutrino spectrum that rises toward lower energies as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1c ] .",

    "[ fig:1b ] . however , there is no kinematic cutoff in the neutrino spectrum in this case , and hence the muon spectrum extends smoothly to the dm mass .",
    "the important point is that there is a distinct separation in energy between the contained muon peak of prompt neutrinos at the dm mass and the @xmath40 and @xmath52 peaks at lower energies .",
    "this indicates that scenarios with dm annihilation to primary neutrinos can be distinguished from those with dm annihilating to @xmath40 bosons or @xmath52 s .",

    "the contours are narrower in this case , implying that the reconstruction is easier .",
    "the main reason for this is that the number of muon events from secondary neutrinos is significantly larger , compare figs .",
    "[ fig:1b ] and  [ fig:1c ] .",
    "the larger signal to background ratio places a stronger constraint on the simultaneous variation of @xmath82 and @xmath16 , which results in an improved reconstruction .",
    "some comments are in order . in producing these figures ,",
    "a scan of angular cuts in @xmath73 increments within the @xmath89 range was made .",
    "while visually a @xmath73 cut may be optimal in distinguishing the presence of the neutrino channel , a @xmath68 cut was optimal in reconstructing the branching ratios in the presence of the broad , low energy @xmath40 or @xmath52 spectrum .",
    "we also note that the muon event rates for both the signal and background must be convolved with the effective volume of the detector for contained muon events , which is a function of energy .",
    "ic / dc maintains significant volume above 10 gev  @xcite . while the geometric volume for ic / dc is about @xmath90 of the volume of ic , the more dense spacing of doms in ic / dc",
    "make it more efficient at event detections for energies below 100 gev  @xcite .",
    "the effective volume in this range increases with energy as longer muon tracks are more likely to produce detectable light .",
    "this can make the effect of the peak at the dm mass from primary neutrinos even more distinctive above the smeared @xmath40 or @xmath52 spectrum .",
    "the reconstruction can therefore be better than shown here after accounting for the energy dependence of the effective volume .",
    "finally , one year results for a @xmath91 effective volume , with the sun below the horizon , translate to roughly ten years of a @xmath92 detector capable of operating for a full year .",
    "thus , in the region of ic / dc sensitivity that would yield a discovery of prompt neutrinos after one year , 10 years of data could allow reconstruction of the branching ratios for the ic / dc effective volume . a larger detector with the same capabilities can significantly improve these prospects .",
    "once the presence of direct dm annihilation to neutrinos is confirmed , it is desirable to also learn the flavor of the final state neutrinos .",
    "this will provide specific information about models that connect dm to the neutrino sector .",
    "for example , in the @xmath48 extension of mssm where the lightest rh sneutrino is the dm candidate  @xcite , flavor composition of final state neutrinos is related to the neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "therefore , knowledge of the neutrino flavors will yield useful information pertaining to the underlying neutrino mass model and leptogenesis .    here",
    "we show how regeneration of @xmath0 inside the sun and its effect on the muon spectrum may be used as a novel method to distinguish the flavor of primary neutrinos in the final state .",
    "dm annihilation produces neutrinos in flavor eigenstates in the sun .",
    "neutrinos then undergo charged current interactions with matter as they propagate through the sun .",
    "these interactions convert @xmath93 to @xmath94 respectively .",
    "@xmath53 s and @xmath25 s are stopped immediately due to electromagnetic interactions . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath52 decays quickly before losing too much energy because of its very short lifetime of @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "this decay produces a @xmath0 , which has a lower energy than the original one .",
    "charged current interactions therefore suppress the peak of the neutrino spectrum at the dm mass for all flavors . however , in the case of the @xmath0 , the regeneration of neutrinos via three - body decay populates the spectrum at energies well below the dm mass .",
    "the cross section for charged current interactions is proportional to the energy of primary neutrinos produced at the center of the sun , which is essentially equal to the dm mass .",
    "neutrino absorption becomes significant when the absorption length of neutrinos @xmath96 is roughly equivalent to the core size of the sun @xmath97 km . using the charged current neutrino - nucleon cross section  @xcite and a core density of @xmath98",
    ", we find that @xmath99 km at energies @xmath100 gev . oscillations among different flavors should be taken into account as neutrinos travel through the sun .",
    "we note that for @xmath2 the flavor and mass eigenstates are the same deep inside the sun .",
    "this implies that upon production at the center of the sun @xmath2 s propagate through the core without changing their flavor .",
    "thus absorption via charged current interactions start to suppress the flux of @xmath2 for dm masses above @xmath12 gev as discussed above .    on the other hand , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are not mass eigenstates inside the sun , and hence undergo oscillations .",
    "since matter effects are the same for these two flavors , the @xmath101 oscillation length inside the sun is set by the atmospheric mass splitting @xmath102 .",
    "as long as @xmath103 , oscillations mix @xmath1 and @xmath0 efficiently before the absorption becomes important . as a result ,",
    "@xmath1 final states also feel the regeneration effect .",
    "since @xmath104 and @xmath105 , at sufficiently high energies @xmath96 drops below @xmath106 .",
    "this happens for a dm mass of about @xmath107 gev .",
    "starting at this point , @xmath101 oscillations cease to be effective .",
    "hence @xmath1 gets absorbed through charged current interactions similar to @xmath2 . in consequence , only the @xmath0 final state retains a significant regeneration signature for dm masses above 500 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we show the muon and neutrino spectra for different flavors of primary neutrinos . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig:5a ] , the @xmath1 channel shows some regeneration effect for a 400 gev particle , which makes it distinguishable from the @xmath2 channel . for a 600 gev dm particle ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig:5b ] , the @xmath101 oscillations are inefficient .",
    "therefore , only the @xmath0 channel shows significant regeneration , which makes it distinguishable from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "the regeneration effect results in a peak in the muon spectrum at low energies , which becomes more pronounced as the dm mass increases .",
    "these figures are for the normal hierarchy of neutrinos and @xmath59 , but variations in the neutrino oscillation scheme do not change the substantive features of the spectra .      as we saw , the @xmath0 regeneration effect becomes significant at dm masses above @xmath12 gev .",
    "the background from atmospheric neutrinos is relatively small at such energies due to the power law decrease in cosmic ray background .",
    "however , the neutrino signal from dm annihilation is also kinematically suppressed for heavier dm masses .",
    "this leaves few events to detect in the interesting range of the spectrum where a regeneration peak is evident .",
    "additionally , energy reconstruction for the contained muon spectrum above @xmath12 gev begins to suffer from logarithmic error in energy since the reconstruction also depends on the amount of light produced in brehmsstrahlung radiation and pair production .",
    "events can not be fully contained at these energies , so reconstruction efforts based on track length are imprecise .",
    "integrated muon spectra from 60 gev to the dm mass with a @xmath68 angular cut as a function of dm mass for @xmath74 @xmath72 .",
    "the dotted , solid and dashed lines denote the @xmath108 and @xmath0 final states respectively .",
    "the background is shown in black line .",
    "the bands of lines for each flavor depict different oscillation scenarios ( normal and inverted mass hierarchy as well as @xmath109 ) .",
    "the separation between the @xmath0 and @xmath2 exceeds the poisson error of the signal and background for dm masses above 300 gev , and the @xmath0 becomes distinguishable from @xmath1 above 600 gev as well . ]    to mitigate these experimental challenges , we integrate the contained muon events above a threshold to consider if the cumulative effect of the regeneration is visible . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] we show the integrated events above @xmath56 gev with a @xmath68 angular cut , which readily retains the low energy regeneration effect .",
    "one can see the separation between the @xmath2 channel and the @xmath110 channels above @xmath12 gev , and between the @xmath0 channel and the @xmath108 channels above @xmath107 gev ( as discussed above ) .",
    "separation between signals from different channels is typically larger than the poisson error of the background and signal together .",
    "the background and signal are shown separately since the background may be subtracted from the signal by observing away from the sun , off - source , as is done in galactic center dm searches  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the oscillation scenario does not significantly affect these results .",
    "the bands of lines depicting the normal and inverted hierarchies as well as @xmath111 ranging from @xmath112 to @xmath113 for each flavor do not overlap at dm masses above @xmath12 gev .",
    "these results assume @xmath114 , which is compatible with the current bounds from ic for heavier dm , and is within the reach of ic / dc sensitivity limits  @xcite .     the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] after normalization to account for unknown value of the dm elastic scattering cross section .",
    "the normalized spectra give the same number of events ( when integrated from @xmath115 gev to the dm mass for a @xmath73 angular cut ) as the @xmath1 final state for normal mass hierarchy and @xmath116 .",
    "the separation between the @xmath0 and other flavors still exceeds the poisson error of the signal and background . ]",
    "if the elastic scattering cross section of the dm is known , then a simple integration as in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] will be sufficient to distinguish the flavor of primary neutrinos by using the regeneration effect .",
    "however , a confirmation of annihilation to primary neutrinos would likely come from the presence of a monochromatic peak alone , the height of which depends on the scattering cross section . in the absence of information about the cross section",
    ", we then need to normalize the signal to extract information about the neutrino flavor . the height of the peak in the muon spectrum is closely related to the height of the neutrino peak .",
    "however , for dm masses above 300 gev , for which the regeneration effect becomes important , muon events at the peak are not fully contained .",
    "it will be most difficult to reconstruct the energy of these events without track - length information .",
    "instead , we integrate muon events above 200 gev , which are essentially the through - going muons , using a @xmath73 angular cut on the muon spectrum in order to best capture the monochromatic peak .",
    "we then use this to normalize the integrated muon flux above 60 gev with a @xmath68 cut to retain the maximum effect of regeneration at low energies .",
    "the normalization accounts for the lack of knowledge in the value of the dm elastic scattering cross section , and to a lesser extent the oscillation parameters .",
    "after normalization , see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , the separation between the @xmath0 channel and the @xmath108 channels remains and is still larger than the statistical error of the background and signal together .",
    "using the regeneration effect , the ic / dc effective volume could reasonably yield a determination of the neutrino flavor after 10 full years of operation .",
    "we have investigated prospects of determining dm annihilation final states with neutrino telescopes by using the spectrum of contained muon tracks from conversion of neutrinos that are produced in the annihilation of dm particles trapped inside the sun . our focus was on distinguishing neutrino final states from gauge boson and tau final states and on discriminating the flavor of final state neutrinos .",
    "gauge boson and tau final states are typically the dominant annihilation channels in supersymmetric models with neutralino dm , while direct annihilation into neutrinos can occur in models that connect dm to the neutrino sector . the theoretical motivation for the latter could provide the grounds for a dedicated analysis by the icecube collaboration to put stringent bounds on annihilation to primary neutrinos , similar to what has been done for annihilation to gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "primary neutrinos from dm annihilation result in a distinct peak in the muon spectrum at the dm mass . for dm masses below @xmath12 gev",
    "we can expect that the peak will be accessible to a detector the size of ic .",
    "the spectrum is smeared as a result of the experimental error in energy reconstruction , but primary neutrinos may be distinguished from gauge boson and tau final states after this effect is taken into account .",
    "we showed that for an energy resolution of 10 gev ( as in ic / dc ) and by making an optimal angular cut on the muons ( which we found to be @xmath117 ) , the branching ratios may be determined in the parameter space within the reach of the one - year sensitivity limits of ic / dc with a km@xmath58/yr of data .",
    "this is roughly equivalent to @xmath77 years of data for a detector with the same capabilities and effective volume as ic / dc .",
    "the regeneration of @xmath0 inside the sun may be used to distinguish the flavor of final state primary neutrinos .",
    "this effect becomes important for dm masses above @xmath12 gev and populates the spectrum with muons whose energy is well below the energy of primary neutrinos . for dm masses up to about @xmath107 gev",
    ", oscillations mix @xmath1 and @xmath0 effectively , which implies that regeneration affects final states with @xmath1 and @xmath0 similarly .",
    "final states with @xmath2 are therefore distinguishable within this mass range . for heavier dm particles ,",
    "the @xmath101 oscillation becomes inefficient . as a result , @xmath0",
    "final states are picked out by the regeneration effect for dm masses above @xmath107 gev .",
    "we showed that final states with @xmath0 stand out at a statistically significant level for dm masses as heavy as @xmath118 gev , even after normalizing the muon spectrum to the total event count ( to account for the unknown dm - nucleon elastic scattering cross section ) .",
    "again , such a distinction may be achieved with @xmath77 years of data from ic / dc .    in summary , using the the ic / dc results in tandem with independent measurements of the dm mass ( for example , from the lhc ) , will allow us to identify the annihilation channels of dm with multi - year data . improved energy resolution and increased effective volume of the detector will greatly help in achieving this goal .",
