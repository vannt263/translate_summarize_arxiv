    "<S> , the cps contribution does not change significantly with @xmath23 ( for low enough @xmath23 ) , but the local contribution can be reduced strongly . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is due to the lifting of the spin - degeneracy by the zeeman shift , which results in a reduction of lar due to the opposite - spin electrons of a cooper pair tunneling through a ( partially ) polarized level . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an increase in the cps efficiency defined as @xmath49 @xcite .     </S>",
