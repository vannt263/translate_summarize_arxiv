    "since the discovery of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) as a collective thermal excitation in highly excited ( hot ) nuclei  @xcite , many experiments were carried out in the last three decades to extract the gdr width and its shape ( linearized strength function ) as functions of nuclear temperature @xmath1 and angular momentum @xmath2 . a recent compilation of gdr built on excited states is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . at present",
    ", the well - established systematics accumulated by measuring the @xmath3 decays of various hot compound nuclei formed in heavy - ion fusion reactions and inelastic scattering of light particles on heavy targets has shown that the gdr width increases with temperature @xmath1 within the temperature region 1 mev @xmath4 3  4 mev .",
    "it has also shown that the gdr width s increase with angular momentum @xmath2 becomes noticeable only at @xmath5 27  30 @xmath6 in heavy nuclei , whereas its location ( peak energy ) remains mostly unchanged as @xmath1 and @xmath2 vary .",
    "experimental studies often refer to the thermal shape fluctuation model ( tsfm )  @xcite as one of theoretical descriptions of the width s increase in this temperature region .",
    "the tsfm takes the thermal average of the gdr photoabsorption cross section over the shape - dependent cross sections caused by all fluctuating quadrupole shapes , which are assumed to be coupled to the gdr vibration .",
    "the width s increase as a function of @xmath1 arises as a results of such thermal average .",
    "the tsfm , however , fails to describe the temperature dependence of the gdr width beyond the temperature region 1.5 @xmath7 3 mev . at @xmath8 3",
    " 4 mev several experimental evidences have shown that the gdr width seems to saturate at high @xmath1  @xcite , whereas the tsfm predicts a continuously increasing width .",
    "in the low temperature region , at @xmath9 1 mev , a measurement of @xmath3 decays in coincidence with @xmath10o particles scattered inelastically from @xmath11sn  @xcite has obtained a gdr width in @xmath11sn of around 4 mev at @xmath12 1 mev , that is smaller than its value of 4.9 mev at @xmath12 0 .",
    "this result and the existing systematics for the gdr width in @xmath11sn up to @xmath13 1.5 mev are significantly lower than the prediction by the tsfm .",
    "meanwhile , the gdr width as a function of temperature @xmath1 is well described by the phonon damping model ( pdm )  @xcite in the entire region 0@xmath4 5 - 6 mev , including the increase in the width at @xmath9 3 mev as well as the width saturation at high @xmath1 . within the pdm ,",
    "the damping of gdr at @xmath14 0 is caused by coupling of the gdr to noncollective particle - hole ( @xmath15 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath16 ) [ hole - hole ( @xmath17 ) ] configurations .",
    "the coupling to @xmath15 configurations exists even at @xmath18 0 , and leads to the quantal width @xmath19 , whereas the thermal width @xmath20 arises owing to coupling to @xmath16 and @xmath17 configurations , which appear only at @xmath14 0 because of the distortion of the fermi surface at @xmath14 0 . in the low temperature region",
    "@xmath9 1 mev , it has been shown within the pdm that thermal pairing plays a crucial role in reducing the gdr width in @xmath11sn  @xcite . as a matter of fact , in finite systems such as nuclei , the pairing gap does not collapse at the critical temperature @xmath21 0.57@xmath22 [ @xmath22 being the pairing gap at @xmath18 0 ] as in the case of the superfluid - normal phase transition in infinite systems , but decreases monotonically as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this decrease of pairing tends to restore the fermi surface , which is diffused in the presence of pairing , back to the sharp step - function distribution .",
    "this competes with the thermal smoothing of the fermi surface , which increases with @xmath1 . as a result of such competition",
    ", a compensation takes place , which leaves the gdr width almost unchanged or even decreases slightly at @xmath9 1 mev . at @xmath23 2 mev ,",
    "pairing becomes significantly smaller than its value at @xmath18 0 , so the thermal distortion of the fermi surface becomes dominant and the width starts to increase .",
    "very recently , @xmath24 induced fusion reactions were used to measure the gdr width at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "these reactions can describe temperature more precisely whereas the associated angular momentum in the mass region @xmath25 115  121 is rather small ( @xmath26 24@xmath6 ) .",
    "the data extracted from these latest experiments for the gdr width in @xmath27sb at 0.98 @xmath4 1.23 mev  @xcite are similar to those obtained previously for @xmath11sn , including the data point at @xmath18 1 mev mentioned above , in good agreement with the prediction by the pdm for the gdr width in @xmath11sn when thermal pairing is included . however , these experiments also reported the data for the gdr width in @xmath0tl  @xcite , which were extracted within the temperature interval 0.8 @xmath28 1.2 mev .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than the prediction by the tsfm for the gdr width in @xmath29pb even after including the shell effect .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also made a comparison with the prediction by the pdm using the results for the gdr width in @xmath29pb .",
    "however @xmath29pb is a doubly closed shell nucleus , that is the neutron and proton pairing gaps are both zero , and , naturally , no pairing was taken into account in the pdm prediction for the gdr width in this nucleus , whereas @xmath0tl is an open - shell nucleus for both neutrons ( n=120 ) and protons ( z=81 ) . therefore",
    ", an adequate comparison should be made with the prediction within the pdm for the gdr width of the same @xmath0tl nucleus , including the effects owing to thermal pairing of neutrons as well as protons .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to make such prediction .",
    "as has been mentioned above , the conventional finite - temperature ( ft ) bcs theory , which exhibits a collapse of the pairing gap at a critical temperature @xmath30 , should be modified to include thermal fluctuations when it is applied to finite nuclei . among such modifications",
    "are the modified bcs ( mbcs )  @xcite , the finite - temperature bcs1 ( ftbcs1 ) as well as the lipkin - nogami projected ftbcs1 ( the so - called ftln1 )  @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches fail for a close - to - magic nucleus such as @xmath0tl ( z=81 ) .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , we employ the exact treatment of thermal pairing within the canonical ensemble ( ce ) , which has been elaborated in ref . @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "the thermal pairing gaps are calculated from the exact pairing energy , which is obtained by averaging the exact eigenvalues of the pairing problem in the ce at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "this approach also allows us to calculate the exact single - particle occupation numbers , chemical potentials , as well as the exact quasiparticle energies . by using the latter",
    ", one can determine the quantities that approximate the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the bogolyubov s transformation from particles to quasiparticles as well as the corresponding quasiparticle occupation numbers and use them as ingredients to calculate the gdr width as a function of @xmath1 in @xmath0tl within the quasiparticle representation of the pdm .",
    "because the recent data for the gdr width in @xmath0tl at low @xmath1 were obtained at low angular momentum ( below 25@xmath6 ) , the effect of angular momentum on the gdr width is negligible .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , angular momentum is not included in the present calculations ( see ref .",

    "( [ fwhm ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) , which include the exact ce thermal pairing gap for 18 levels around the fermi surface for neutrons and protons , separately , as has been discussed in sec .",
    "the gdr width predicted by this approach ( thick solid line ) nicely describes all the data points for @xmath0tl .",
    "its values at @xmath12 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.1 and 1.2 mev are found equal to 3.58 , 3.75 , 3.96 , 4.22 and 4.5 mev , respectively , to be compared with the corresponding experimental values of 3.4@xmath170 0.45 , 3.7@xmath170 0.45 , 3.8@xmath170 0.45 , 4.6@xmath170 0.45 and 4.5@xmath170 0.45 mev at @xmath18 0.82 , 0.94 , 0.97 , 1.09 and 1.12 mev , respectively .",
    "it also matches fairly well the experimental width for @xmath29pb at 1.3@xmath171 2 mev , although , up to @xmath13 3 mev , it remains smaller than the width predicted by the pdm for @xmath29pb ( dotted line ) .",
    "however , to obtain such description , the value for @xmath49 has to be smaller than that used in the case without pairing so that @xmath172 3 mev instead of 4 mev for the gdr width in @xmath29pb at @xmath173 , and , consequently , the value for @xmath50 has to be larger to reproduce the same data point at @xmath18 2 mev .",
    "eventually , this brings @xmath174 closer to the recent parametrization of the gdr width for quasipherical nuclei  @xcite , which implies that the gdr fwhm for @xmath0tl at @xmath18 0 amounts to around 3.33 mev , rather than 4 mev as that of @xmath29pb .",
    "the slope of the width s increase as a function of @xmath1 also becomes slightly steeper , improving the agreement between theory and experiment within the entire region of @xmath1 . a value for @xmath49 that reproduces @xmath175 4 mev leads to an overestimation of the width in the entire temperature region of @xmath14 0 .",
    "the values for the coupling parameters used in this approximation are @xmath169 2.81@xmath16010@xmath161 mev and @xmath162 16.73@xmath16010@xmath161 mev .",
    "it is important to point out that , although one could fit the data points for @xmath0tl within the zero - pairing approximation by reducing the value of parameter @xmath49 from 4.0@xmath16010@xmath161 mev to 3.54@xmath16010@xmath161 mev , it is not possible by readjusting only parameters @xmath81 to achieve the overall agreement with both sets of data for the gdr widths in @xmath0tl and @xmath29pb as does the last approach that fully includes exact ce pairing gaps within the quasiparticle representation of the pdm . at @xmath8 2.5 mev the gdr width obtained by using such reduced parameter @xmath49 in the zero - pairing approximation becomes even smaller than that predicted by the second approximation ( of taking effectively thermal pairing into account ) .",

    "this figure and fig . [ widthtl201 ] show that the pdm describes reasonably well not only the temperature dependence of the gdr width but also that of the gdr linearized shape .",

    "thermal pairing is taken into account by using the exact treatment of pairing within the canonical ensemble .",
    "this treatment allows us to calculate the exact equivalences to the pairing gaps for protons and neutrons in a nucleus neighboring a proton closed - shell one .",
    "because of thermal fluctuations owing to the finiteness of the system , which are inherent in the ce , the exact ce thermal pairing gaps do not collapse at the critical temperature @xmath30 of the superfluid - normal phase transition as in the case of infinite systems , but decrease monotonically as @xmath1 increases , and remain finite up to @xmath1 as high as 5 mev .",
    "the theoretical predictions within the pdm are compared with the data , which were recently obtained for the gdr width and strength functions in @xmath0tl at 0.8@xmath177 1.2 mev at low angular momentum below 25@xmath6 .",
    "the good agreement between the pdm predictions including thermal pairing and the experimental data is a clear demonstration of the manifestation of the effect owing to thermal pairing , which plays a vital role in reducing the gdr width at low @xmath1 in open - shell nuclei . under the influence of thermal pairing",
    ", the gdr width in @xmath0tl becomes as low as around 3.7 mev at @xmath18 0.8 mev , and the width @xmath174 of the gdr built on the ground state ( @xmath18 0 ) can be as small as 3 mev , that is smaller than the gdr width in @xmath29pb ( 4 mev ) at @xmath18 0 .",
    "the results obtained in the present work as well as the previous predictions for the gdr width in @xmath11sn , where the important role of neutron thermal pairing has been shown to reduce the gdr width at @xmath9 1 mev  @xcite , confirm that , in order to have an adequate description of gdr damping at low @xmath1 , a microscopic model needs to take into account thermal pairing at least up to @xmath178 1.5 mev .",
