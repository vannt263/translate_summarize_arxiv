    "motivated by topological studies from  @xcite graphs @xmath0 have been introduced in  @xcite and named sierpiski graphs in  @xcite . in the book  @xcite these graphs are called klavar - milutinovi graphs . for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the graph @xmath0 is defined on the vertex set @xmath3 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] for @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , where two different vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 are adjacent if and only if there exists an index @xmath8 in @xmath9 such that    * @xmath10 , for @xmath11 ; * @xmath12 ; and * @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 .     and @xmath5 , together with the corresponding vertex labelings .",
    "the extreme vertices of @xmath4 are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , whereas the extreme vertices of @xmath5 are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "notice that each inner vertex @xmath23 has exactly one neighbour outside the @xmath24-clique @xmath25 , and that the set of edges @xmath26 is a matching.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    a vertex of the form @xmath27 of @xmath0 is called an _ extreme vertex _ , all other vertices of @xmath0 are called _ inner _ vertices .",
    "the extreme vertices of @xmath0 are of degree @xmath28 while the degree of the inner vertices is @xmath24 .",
    "note also that there are exactly @xmath24 extreme vertices in @xmath0 , and that @xmath0 has @xmath29 vertices .",
    "let @xmath30 be an arbitrary vertex of @xmath0 .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the @xmath24-clique induced by vertices of the form @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "notice that the neighbourhood of an extreme vertex @xmath23 is @xmath33 , and that an inner vertex @xmath23 has only one neighbour that does not belong to @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , the set of edges @xmath26 is a matching .",
    "these properties will be extensively used in the sequel .",
    "notice that the sierpiski graph @xmath0 can be constructed inductively as follows .",
    "we start the construction with a @xmath24-clique , that can be seen as the sierpiski graph @xmath34 .",
    "to construct @xmath35 , one has to make @xmath24 copies of the @xmath24-clique , that will be connected to each other with an edge set in 1-to-1 correspondence with the edges of a @xmath24-clique . by repeating this procedure , we",
    "can then recursively construct @xmath0 by connecting @xmath24 copies of @xmath36 with a set of @xmath37 edges ( see figure  [ fig : inductive_construction ] ) .     of the recursive procedure that enables to construct a sierpiski graph @xmath0 from @xmath24 copies of @xmath36 .",

    "another family of graphs related to sierpiski graphs are the so - called sierpiski gasket graphs , where all edges which are themselves maximal cliques are contracted",
    ". some more variations of graphs that can be obtained from sierpiski graphs have been considered in the papers  @xcite .",
    "recently generalized sierpiski graphs have been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "they are defined in a similar way as sierpiski graphs , the difference lying in the fact that the starting graph can be any graph and not just a clique .    extending the result about the existence of 1-perfect codes in the tower of hanoi graphs from @xcite and @xcite , it has been shown in @xcite that 1-perfect codes exist for all graphs @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely it is shown in @xcite that @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the domination number of a graph @xmath43 .",
    "this result has been further generalized in @xcite , where all existing @xmath44-codes of sierpiski graphs have been characterized .",
    "sierpiski graphs have also been studied for @xmath45-labelings  @xcite , crossing numbers  @xcite , and different types of colorings  @xcite .    in this note",
    "we compute the minimum size of identifying codes , locating - dominating codes , and total - dominating codes in sierpiski graphs .      in a simple undirected graph @xmath43 ,",
    "let @xmath46 denote the minimum number of edges of a path having @xmath23 and @xmath47 as extremities .",
    "let @xmath48 be a subset of vertices of @xmath43 , we call @xmath48 a _ code _ of graph @xmath43 . for a vertex @xmath23 of @xmath43 ,",

    ", @xmath48 covers @xmath23 if and only if we either have @xmath51 , or there exists @xmath52 such that @xmath23 and @xmath47 are neighbours . the code @xmath48 is said to _ totally cover _ a vertex @xmath23 if we have @xmath53 .",
    "we say that @xmath48 _ separates _ two distinct vertices @xmath54 if @xmath55 .",
    "the code @xmath48 is a _ covering code _ ( or a dominating code ) of @xmath43 if @xmath48 covers all the vertices of @xmath43 .",

    "this terminology is standard , see  @xcite for more about covering codes and @xcite for a bibliography of problems about identifying codes and locating - dominating codes .",
    "many papers in the recent literature deal with these codes considered in regular structures , such as hypercubes @xcite , lattices @xcite , cycles @xcite , and cartesian products of graphs @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we propose to address the computation of the minimum cardinality of such codes in sierpiski graphs .",
    "[ thm : idcodes ] the minimum cardinality of an identifying code in a sierpiski graph @xmath0 is @xmath56 .",
    "we shall first prove that for any identifying code @xmath48 of @xmath0 , we have @xmath57 .",
    "for each inner vertex @xmath23 of @xmath0 , let @xmath58 denote the unique neighbour of @xmath23 which does not belong to @xmath25 .",
    "for each @xmath24-clique @xmath59 of @xmath0 , let us consider the set @xmath60 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath61 s are all disjoint , and the number of such sets is @xmath62 . now , by way of contradiction , assume that there exist two inner vertices @xmath63 of a given @xmath24-clique @xmath59 such that @xmath58 and @xmath64 do not belong to @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath23 and @xmath47 would not be separated , a contradiction . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath59 contains an extreme vertex , all the vertices of @xmath61 must be in @xmath48 to separate the extreme vertex from the other vertices of @xmath59 .",
    "hence , for each @xmath24-clique @xmath59 , there are at least @xmath28 vertices of @xmath61 that belong to @xmath48 .",
    "since there are @xmath62 sets @xmath61 , and they are all disjoint , this implies that the cardinality of @xmath48 is at least @xmath56 .",
    "now , observe that if @xmath65 , then the set of inner vertices of @xmath35 is an identifying code of @xmath35 , of cardinality @xmath66 .",
    "hence the minimum cardinality of an identifying code of @xmath35 is @xmath66 .",
    "now let us consider the general case @xmath0 , with @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the subset of vertices of @xmath0 such that , for any subgraph @xmath67 of @xmath0 which is isomorphic to @xmath35 , the vertices of @xmath67 that belong to @xmath48 are exactly the inner vertices of @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath48 is an identifying code of @xmath0 , of cardinality @xmath56 .",

    ". the set of crossing edges is a matching and each inner vertex belongs to exactly one crossing edge .",
    "consider now the following partition @xmath72 of the vertices of @xmath0 : each extreme vertex is itself a part of @xmath72 and each pair of vertices @xmath73 forming a crossing edge is a part of @xmath72 .",
    "for each vertex @xmath23 of @xmath0 , let @xmath74 be the set of @xmath72 containing @xmath23 .    by way of contradiction",
    ", assume that there exist two vertices @xmath63 of a given @xmath24-clique @xmath59 such that @xmath75 contains no element of @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath23 and @xmath47 are not in the code and not separated , a contradiction . hence , for any @xmath24-clique @xmath59 , at least @xmath28 sets among the @xmath24 sets of @xmath72 containing one vertex of @xmath59 must contain a vertex of @xmath48 . a set of @xmath72 can contribute to at most two different @xmath24-cliques and there are @xmath62 @xmath24-cliques .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 .",
    "now , let us consider any code @xmath48 such that for each @xmath24-clique @xmath59 , @xmath28 of the sets of @xmath72 containing a vertex of @xmath59 contain at least one vertex of @xmath48 .",

    "to construct such a code , one can for example take an hamiltonian cycle of @xmath76 , and for the corresponding crossing edge ( there is a natural bijection between the crossing edges of @xmath35 and the edges of a @xmath24-clique ) , take every second vertex . clearly , this code has size @xmath37 . * for @xmath77 , on each subgraph @xmath67 of @xmath0 which is isomorphic to @xmath35 , we put in the code @xmath48 the vertices of @xmath67 corresponding to the previous code of @xmath35",
    ". there are @xmath78 such ( disjoint ) subgraphs @xmath67 , hence , @xmath48 has size @xmath68 .",

    "let @xmath67 be a subgraph isomorphic to @xmath35 and let @xmath48 be a total - dominating code of @xmath0 .",
    "if all the @xmath24-cliques of @xmath67 contain at least one vertex of @xmath48 , then we are done .",
    "hence , let us assume that there is a @xmath24-clique @xmath59 of @xmath67 containing no vertex of @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that @xmath59 does not contain any extreme vertex .",
    "then each vertex @xmath23 of @xmath59 has exactly one neighbour @xmath58 that is not in @xmath59 , and must therefore be in @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , at least one neighbour of @xmath58 , which is in @xmath81 , must also be in @xmath48 .",
    "each other @xmath24-clique of @xmath67 must then contain at least two vertices of @xmath48 .",
    "hence @xmath67 contains at least @xmath82 vertices of @xmath48 , and we are done .",
    "this proves that the cardinality of a total - dominating code is greater than or equal to @xmath62 .",
    "now we distinguish two cases .",
    "first let @xmath24 be an even number .",
    "let @xmath48 bet the set of vertices of @xmath35 induced by a perfect matching of @xmath76 , such that vertices @xmath83 and @xmath84 of @xmath35 belong to @xmath48 if and only if edge @xmath85 of @xmath76 belongs to the perfect matching .",
    "set @xmath48 covers all vertices of @xmath35 , and since any vertex from @xmath48 has also a neighbour from another clique which is also in @xmath48 , then the set @xmath48 is a total - dominating code .",
    "hence @xmath48 is a minimum total - dominating code of @xmath35 . using the same arguments for each copy of @xmath35 in @xmath0",
    "it follows that @xmath86 , when @xmath24 is even .",
    "note that since each vertex of a total - dominating code @xmath48 must be a neighbour of another vertex of @xmath48 , then all minimum total - dominating codes can be constructed in such a way .",
    "when @xmath24 is odd , it is impossible to find a total - dominating code of @xmath62 vertices intersecting each @xmath24-clique exactly once . indeed , in this case , each vertex of @xmath48 would be neighbour to exactly one another vertex of @xmath48 .",
    "hence there would be a perfect matching running on an odd number of vertices , which is impossible .",
    "hence , when @xmath24 is odd , the cardinality of a total - dominating code is greater than or equal to @xmath87 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath65 . to construct a minimum total - dominating code , we can similarly take a maximum matching of @xmath76 , and build set @xmath48 in the same way as in the previous case . in this case one @xmath24-clique of @xmath35 is not dominated by @xmath48 and we must add two of its vertices to @xmath48 to get a minimum total - dominating code .",
    "this gives altogether one additional vertex in @xmath48 compared to the size of @xmath48 in the even case .",
    "for @xmath88 we choose in each copy of @xmath35 inside @xmath89 , a subset of vertices induced by a maximum matching of @xmath76 and put them in the set @xmath48 . for a @xmath24-clique that is not dominated ,",
    "we choose the extreme vertex of @xmath35 and put it in set @xmath48 .",
    "we can choose @xmath24-cliques belonging to different copies of @xmath35 so that they induce a maximum matching in @xmath76 , and choose corresponding extreme vertices and put them into @xmath48 .",
    "similarly as in the case @xmath65 , one @xmath24-clique remains which has only one vertex in @xmath48 and therefore we must add one more vertex from this @xmath24-clique to @xmath48 in order to get a minimum total - dominating code of @xmath89 . by iteratively repeating this procedure we construct a minimum total - dominating code of @xmath0 , for any given @xmath90 .",
    "therefore it follows that @xmath91 , when @xmath24 is odd .",

    "propose the following conjecture about an upper bound of the cardinality of a minimum identifying code of a given graph in terms of its number of vertices and maximum degree .",
    "we recall that two adjacent vertices are said to be _ twins _ if they have the same neighbourhood .",
    "a graph having no twins is said twin - free .",
    "a graph admits an identifying code if and only if it is twin - free .      from the results of this paper it follows that sierpiski graphs attain this bound . it might be interesting to consider another families of graphs attaining this bound that might be constructed in a similar manner as sierpiski graphs or to provide a counterexample to the given conjecture"
