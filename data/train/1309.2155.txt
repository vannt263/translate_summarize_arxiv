    "the response of topological states to external disturbances does not occur in the gapped bulk , but manifests itself through the edge dynamics .",
    "while the edge excitations of chiral states , such as quantum hall states and chern insulators , are absolutely stable , those of non - chiral topological states can interact and became gapful , leading to the decay into topologically trivial phases . in some cases ,",
    "edge interactions are forbidden by the presence of ( discrete ) symmetries : we then speak of symmetry protected topological phases of matter @xcite .",
    "topological insulators protected by time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry have been first analyzed in free fermion systems using band theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "these systems were found to be characterized by a topological bulk quantity equal to the @xmath0 index @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of fermion edge modes of each chirality .",
    "the odd ( even ) @xmath2 cases were shown to be stable ( unstable ) upon using a remarkable flux argument by fu , kane and mele @xcite .",

    "it was shown that the @xmath0 classification extends to interacting systems that are described by abelian edge excitations within the so - called @xmath3-matrix formalism @xcite .",
    "the analysis of levin and stern led to the following simple and general result for the @xmath0 index @xcite : ( -1)^2s , 2s= , [ ls - index ] where @xmath4 is the spin hall conductance and @xmath5 is the minimal fractional charge for one of the spin ( chiral ) components , in units of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "their ratio measures the spin @xmath8 of an excitation created at the edge , as explained later .",
    "an odd ( even ) ratio corresponds to stable ( unstable ) systems , as this quantity reduces to the number of fermion modes in the non - interacting case .    in this paper , we rederive and further extend the @xmath0 stability criterion ( [ ls - index ] ) by studying the partition function of edge excitations . in earlier work , we obtained the general form of the partition function for both abelian and non - abelian quantum hall states @xcite@xcite@xcite . upon generalizing",
    "this analysis to the quantum spin hall effect and topological insulators , we can apply the flux argument for stability to any type of interacting topological insulator and prove the general validity of ( [ ls - index ] ) .",
    "our analysis clarifies that the stability is associated to the presence of an anomaly in the @xmath9 symmetry of fermion number parity at the edge , also equal to the edge spin parity @xmath10 .",
    "actually , the @xmath11 spin symmetry of the quantum spin hall effect is explicitly broken to @xmath10 by spin - orbit interaction and other tr invariant relativistic corrections that are present in generic topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 anomaly is thus the remnant of the @xmath11 anomaly of the spin hall effect , which is analogous to the @xmath12 charge anomaly in the hall effect @xcite .",

    "this structure allows one to disentangle the abelian charged mode that determines the @xmath0 anomaly , from the neutral modes , either abelian or non - abelian , that are transparent .",
    "we can thus analyze the stability ( anomaly ) for general interacting system .",
    "the response of the topological state , i.e. of its edge dynamics , to external perturbations can be easily described by using the partition function .",
    "one can see how its different sectors transforms among themselves by inserting fluxes , i.e. under the effect of an electromagnetic background . furthermore , the behaviour under modular transformations , the discrete coordinate changes respecting the periodicities of the torus , yield the response to ( some type of ) gravitational backgrounds : they amount , e.g. to adding momentum to the system or to swapping space and time ( respectively , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 modular transformations ) .",
    "we find that the stability ( instability ) of non - chiral edge states is associated to the impossibility ( possibility ) of having a modular invariant partition function that is consistent with time reversal symmetry .",
    "the modular non - invariance of stable topological states is actually a kind of gravitational anomaly accompanying the spin parity anomaly . in some systems , we find that flux insertions and modular transformations act in similar way on the four `` spin sectors '' always present in fermionic systems , corresponding to periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in space and time @xcite@xcite . in other systems ,",
    "the two backgrounds have different effects owing to the different couplings of charged and neutral modes .",
    "modular non - invariance and stability of topological states have already been discussed in a paper by ryu and zhang @xcite that actually motivated our work .",
    "they considered the topological superconductors , whose neutral majorana edge modes can not be analyzed by flux arguments , and argued that modular non - invariance of the partition function could be used as a criterion of stability .",
    "then they showed that the system of @xmath15 majorana fermions is unstable for @xmath16 modulo @xmath17 , finding agreement with the study of possible interactions @xcite@xcite .",

    "we can interpreted the chiral anomaly of the edge as the response of the topological bulk to an electromagnetic background , as well explained in the associated description in terms of the effective hydrodynamic chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "other chiral topological phases are also associated to anomalies , leading to the breaking of continuous symmetries and to anomalous currents .",

    "however , the quantum spin hall effect is a rather academic model of topological insulator : in general , spin - orbit coupling and other relativistic effects can not be neglected , that only conserve the total angular momentum ; thus , the @xmath11 symmetry is explicitly broken , the spin current is not defined and the spin hall conductivity vanishes .    in the following ,",
    "we want to discuss general topological insulators that only possess time reversal symmetry and can not be characterized by anomalies of continuum symmetries ; these represent interacting topological phases of a different kind . in our analysis",
    "we shall mostly keep the spin - quantum hall description of topological insulators , that can be investigated by cft methods , corresponding to the the ideal limit of spin - orbit coupling switched off .",

    "the lack of invariance of the partition function signals the presence of gravitational and gauge anomalies , respectively .",
    "these do not led to inconsistencies if the backgrounds are classical , i.e. not quantized , as in our case , but nevertheless characterize the low - energy physics of the system @xcite .",
    "the multiplet of @xmath59 transforms linearly under the modular group and each generator has physical significance , as we now recall @xcite .",

    "altogether the single edge is described by a multiplet of partition functions @xmath59 , that is not modular invariant , meaning that the chiral anomaly , i.e. the spectral flow , implies a discrete gravitational anomaly .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath59 transform in a linear unitary vector representation of @xmath83 , a subgroup of @xmath84 including only @xmath77 transformations and thus allowing fermionic statistics @xcite .",

    "the partition function for the quantum spin hall system made by a pair of laughlin states is obtained by combining chiral and antichiral sectors for up and down spins , respectively , thus obtaining the expressions @xmath85 . in the case of the hall effect of charge and spin ,",
    "the presence of extended states in the bulk of the annulus allows for the matching of fractional charges between opposite edges . in the case of topological insulators , the bulk is insulating , thus the fractional charges should be matched locally at each edge ( the @xmath78 condition ) .",

    "the expression @xmath87 is not completely modular invariant , because the transformations in the quotient @xmath88 deform it into other quantities according to a general pattern .",
    "indeed , the partition functions of fermionic systems always involve four terms corresponding to the four spins structures needed for defining spinors on the torus @xcite . these amount to choosing periodic @xmath89 and antiperiodic @xmath90 boundary conditions for fermion fields in each direction ( in general there are @xmath91 terms on a genus @xmath92 surface ) .",

    "from the point of view of edge dynamics , topological superconductors amount to systems of ( interacting ) @xmath15 neutral chiral majorana modes with spin up and @xmath15 ones with opposite spin and chirality , thus making @xmath15 ising cfts @xcite .",
    "the topological phases are protected by the @xmath282 symmetry of independent edge spin parity for each chirality , @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",
    "this follows from tr symmetry and the absence of spin - flip terms in the bulk hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "since this symmetry does not allow any mass term , the non - interacting topological insulators are classified by the @xmath23 index equal to @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath285 a non - trivial quartic interaction was found that gaps the system without breaking the symmetry explicitly or spontaneously @xcite@xcite .",
    "this interaction is possible because the ising cfts have spin @xmath286 and disorder @xmath58 fields of dimensions @xmath287 , such that the product of eight of them has dimension @xmath288 and can bosonized and refermionized to obtain a quartic fermionic term respecting the symmetry .",
    "therefore , the classification of interacting topological superconductors is associated to a @xmath289 index ( at least ) .    for even @xmath15",
    ", the free majorana fermions have @xmath290 and yield the same fermion systems considered in this paper .",
    "however , the neutral modes can not be probed by flux insertions for studying stability . in an interesting paper @xcite , ryu and",
    "zhang suggested to consider the modular non - invariance as a test of stability of topological superconductors . in practice",
    ", they associated the instability to the modular invariance of the partition function for the singlet sector of the theory with respect to the @xmath282 symmetry , @xmath291 , i.e. involving only bosonic chiral states .",
    "indeed , this projected partition function is modular invariant for @xmath285 , as it corresponds to the so - called gliozzi - scherk - olive projection @xmath292 in superstring theory @xcite .",
    "this results provided a symmetry argument for the instability of @xmath285 topological superconductors @xcite@xcite ( also extended to other systems in @xcite ) .    in our analysis , we considered the partition function of the full theory @xmath134 that is always modular invariant , but argued that it might not be consistent with tr invariance , owing to anomalies in some of its sectors .",
    "the two criteria of stability do not seem to be equivalent in general , but at least they agree on the instability of the @xmath285 case .",
    "the argument goes as follows . in section 3",
    ", we have seen that in free fermionic systems , the half flux insertion maps neveu - schwarz into ramond sectors , i.e. we have the equivalence @xmath293 , between electromagnetic and gravitational responses .",
    "moreover , @xmath151 does the correct flux insertion for measuring the anomaly .",
    "we then consider the chiral spin of the excitation in the @xmath30 sector obtained from the @xmath186 sector by the @xmath105 transformation : for @xmath294 fermion modes , this is @xmath295 . the first @xmath282 anomaly free case is for @xmath285 , with chiral indices : ( -1)^n_=(-1)^n_=1,n_f=8 .",
    "[ 8fermions ] therefore , the modular invariant partition function @xmath134 is free of @xmath282 anomalies for @xmath285 , thus confirming the instability of this system in our analysis .",
    "more general results can not be provided at present , owing to two main difficulties : the correct measure of spin anomaly in other systems and the form of the partition function to be associated to the edge of interacting topological superconductors . regarding the second point",

    "another possible development concerns the comparison with the stability criterion proposed in @xcite , which is based on properties of fusion rules , again related to modular transformations through the verlinde formula .",
    "finally , there is the study of stability of three dimensional systems : in particular , recent works @xcite suggest the existence of topological states at the @xmath298 surface of a @xmath299 topological insulators , whose stability could be different from that of strictly @xmath298 systems considered here .",
