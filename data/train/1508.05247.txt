    "fe / o is an important planetary mineral and a significant component of the earth s mantle , and it may also be important within the earth s core .",
    "seismological studies have shown that the density of the earth s solid inner core is 23% too low to be plausibly explained by pure fe , leading to the suggestion that light elements must also be present.@xcite the identities and concentrations of light elements present in the core have yet to be established , although various arguments favour o , si , c , s and h as the most likely candidates.@xcite    in an earlier paper we investigated the formation of iron carbides at high pressures,@xcite and here we study iron oxides .",
    "o has been suggested as an important light element for explaining both the density jump at the earth s inner core boundary and the observed seismic wave velocities.@xcite the possible presence of o within the core has stimulated a range of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations of the fe / o system , albeit only for a handful of stoichiometries . in this paper",
    "we present a broader investigation spanning 12 different stoichiometries at three different pressures .",
    "we search for stable structures at each stoichiometry and pressure , and construct convex hull diagrams to determine which phases are stable against decomposition .",
    "we also present results for transitions between solid phases up to pressures of 500 gpa .",
    "temperatures within the earth extend to above 6000 k @xcite .",
    "atoms such as o could be present in the earth s core as isolated impurities , as in a solid solution or , alternatively , fe / o compounds could be formed .",
    "a solid solution has a much higher configurational entropy than an ordered fe / o compound plus crystalline fe , but the formation of crystalline fe / o compounds could lead to more favorable bonding arrangements than are obtained in a solid solution . to help understand the conditions under which solid solutions and ordered compounds might be stable it is necessary to determine which compounds are energetically favorable , taking into account a wide range of stoichiometries",
    "this is a formidable task in its own right , although it should be augmented by calculating finite temperature effects arising from the vibrational motion of the atoms , the configurational entropy of the solid solution , and the electronic entropy .",
    "we leave the estimation of finite temperature effects to subsequent work .",
    "we have performed searches at 100 , 350 and 500 gpa .",
    "the pressure at the bottom of the earth s mantle is about 136 gpa , and our data at 100 gpa correspond to a pressure within the lower mantle .",
    "the pressures within the solid inner core are believed to be in the range 330360 gpa,@xcite and our results at 350 gpa are therefore representative of inner core pressures .",
    "the highest pressure at which we have performed searches of 500 gpa is above that found within the earth , although such pressures occur in other planets , including exoplanets .",
    "determining the most stable structure of a material corresponds to finding the global minimum energy state within a high - dimensional space .",
    "a number of methods have been developed to tackle this problem , which have met with varying degrees of success .",
    "the method we use , which has been shown to be successful in determining structures that have subsequently been verified by experiments @xcite , is called _ ab initio _ random structure searching ( airss).@xcite airss has been applied to many systems at high pressures , including iron @xcite and oxygen.@xcite within airss the energy landscape is sampled by generating random structures . the structures are then relaxed to the local enthalpy minimum for some chosen pressure using the castep plane - wave density functional theory ( dft ) code.@xcite this process is repeated until the lowest enthalpy structure is found several times or the available computational resources have been exhausted .    to improve the efficiency of the searches we can impose a number of biases .",
    "one bias we use is to reject initial structures in which the smallest inter - atomic separation is less than some chosen value .",
    "structures which contain atoms that are very close together are extremely high in enthalpy and may even cause the geometry optimization procedure to fail . since the number of local minima is known to increase exponentially with the system size @xcite , an additional bias may be required for searches over larger unit cells .",
    "we use a bias that exploits the fact that low enthalpy structures tend to possess symmetry .",
    "we can create an initial structure with a particular symmetry by first selecting a `` structural unit '' containing @xmath12 formula units ( fu ) .",
    "this structural unit is chosen to be the lowest enthalpy structure found in an @xmath12 fu search . a random space group containing @xmath13 symmetry operations",
    "is then chosen and applied to the structural unit .",
    "this generates a larger initial structure containing @xmath14 fu . in this investigation @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "range from 13 and 24 , respectively .",
    "structures found to be metastable at one pressure may become stable at another .",
    "expanding the enthalpy around the pressure @xmath15 at which a search is performed gives @xmath16 the second - order derivative in eq .",
    "( [ taylorenth ] ) is related to the bulk modulus and is computationally expensive to evaluate .",
    "a useful approximation can , however , often be obtained by neglecting the second - order term and using the fact that the first derivative of @xmath17 with respect to pressure @xmath18 at @xmath15 is equal to the volume @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 since @xmath21 and @xmath19 are evaluated within the structure searching , eq .",
    "( [ linearapprox ] ) may be used to estimate the enthalpies of the phases at any pressure @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to determine approximate pressures at which phase transitions may occur , which we then refine by performing higher accuracy dft calculations .",
    "we used ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite to represent the cores of the fe and o atoms .",
    "for the structure searching we used a fairly soft fe pseudopotential in which only the @xmath22 and @xmath23 electrons were treated explicitly , while for o we treated the @xmath24 and @xmath25 electrons explicitly . for the higher quality calculations we used a harder fe pseudopotential in which the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 electrons were treated explicitly .",
    "both the harder fe pseudopotential and the o pseudopotential have been successfully tested up to terapascal pressures.@xcite    the final structures were obtained using a two - step procedure .",
    "we first used airss in medium - quality calculations which were optimized for computational speed .",
    "the medium quality settings consisted of a @xmath28-point sampling grid of spacing of @xmath290.07 @xmath30 and a plane - wave cut - off energy of 490 ev .",
    "the lowest enthalpy structures for each stoichiometry were then further relaxed in a higher - quality calculation using a finer @xmath28-point sampling grid of spacing @xmath290.03 @xmath30 and a plane - wave cut - off energy of 1000 ev . in all of our searches we used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) exchange correlation functional.@xcite    the fe / o system is known to be problematic for dft - based methods because of magnetic and strong correlation effects .",
    "the presence of magnetism in feo at high pressures has been documented , although there are some conflicting reports .",
    "mssbauer spectroscopy has shown that a continuous transition from high - spin to low - spin states @xcite occurs at 90120 gpa , leading to an eventual collapse at 140 gpa and 300 k. this is in contrast to experiments performed using x - ray emission spectroscopy for feo at 300 k , which have suggested that a magnetic state exists up to at least 143 gpa @xcite , while a magnetic collapse in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 has been observed at 50 gpa.@xcite in addition , zero - temperature static lattice gga dft calculations have predicted a magnetic collapse of feo at around 200 gpa.@xcite    the existence of magnetic order under core conditions can be safely ruled out , as it would be destroyed by the high temperatures .",
    "we have not performed searches with spin - polarization because they are very costly , but to investigate the effects of magnetism on the enthalpies , we have re - relaxed our structures with high quality settings starting from a high spin state .",
    "if a relaxation did not achieve convergence we reduced the initial spin state and re - relaxed until convergence was achieved .",
    "we found that the small magnetic moments have a negligible effect on the enthalpies at the high pressures considered here ( @xmath30.002 ev per atom at 100 gpa in the worst case ) .",
    "for these reasons we do not believe magnetism plays a significant role at the pressures we have investigated and hence we have not considered it further .",
    "similar arguments can be made about the effects of strong coulomb correlations which arise in iron oxides from interactions involving the localized fe @xmath31 electrons .",
    "the strength of such correlations is conventionally measured by the parameter @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the hubbard @xmath33 energy and @xmath34 is the @xmath31 band width .",
    "electrons tend to delocalize at high pressures , which has the effect of increasing @xmath34 and reducing @xmath33.@xcite under these conditions , where the correlations are less strong , gga dft is likely to be reasonably accurate.@xcite     +   +    .[table : structures ] the lowest enthalpy structures found from searching at 100 , 350 and 500 gpa .",

    "a negative @xmath46 indicates that the structure is stable with respect to decomposition into its elements , although it may be unstable with respect to decomposition into compounds of other stoichiometries .",
    "structures lying above the convex hull are unstable with respect to decomposition into other compounds and are therefore less likely to form .",
    "structures lying on the convex hull are thermodynamically stable and are therefore more likely to form .    the convex hull diagrams at 100 , 350 and 500 gpa shown in fig.[fig : convexhull ] exhibit fairly smooth variations with composition .",

    "the former also coincides with a transition from a low symmetry @xmath48 phase to a phase of @xmath49 symmetry .",

    "our results suggest a somewhat different picture from that obtained from compression experiments up to 324 gpa @xcite and at temperatures up to 4880 k. these differences may arise for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , experiments on feo normally use a non - stoichiometric compound , fe@xmath58o , where @xmath44 is typically about 0.05 , whereas our calculations assume stoichiometric feo .",
    "secondly , we have performed static lattice calculations in contrast to real - world experiments which may yield phases stabilized by nuclear vibrational motion .",

    "it is worth remarking , however , that the pbe density functional , which obeys the uniform limit and gives a good account of the linear response of the electron gas to an external potential,@xcite is likely to become more accurate as the pressure is increased .",
    "a notable example of where our predictions for feo differ from observations is at relatively low pressures where experiments ( extrapolated to 0 k ) have shown that feo adopts the rhombohedrally distorted nacl ( rb1 ) structure , which is predicted to be stable up to about 100 gpa.@xcite above 100 gpa a phase transition to the nias ( b8 ) structure is predicted .",
