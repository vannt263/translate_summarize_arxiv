    "quantum properties of light have attracted the attention of scientists since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "arguably one of the main goals in the field of quantum optics is to realize highly nonlinear interactions at the few - photon level which would enable _ e.g. _ to generate various highly nonclassical states of light and implement advanced schemes for quantum information processing .",
    "unfortunately , nonlinear coupling between single photons mediated by common material media is extremely weak so other approaches have to be pursued .",
    "one of the most promising techniques appears to be that of the measurement induced nonlinearities . as shown by knill , laflamme , and milburn @xcite ,",
    "using passive linear optics , ancilla single photons and photon counting measurements one can emulate nonlinear coupling between single photons and implement all - optical quantum cnot gate . during recent years",
    ", the feasibility of this approach has been corroborated by numerous experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , these ideas have been extended also to the so - called continuous variable regime , where quantum information is encoded into states of optical modes instead of single photons .",
    "it was shown that linear canonical transformations of quadrature operators such as squeezing or quantum non - demolition coupling can be implemented with passive linear optics , ancilla squeezed vacuum states , homodyne detection and feedforward @xcite .",
    "going beyond gaussian operations , the basic techniques available are the addition @xcite and subtraction @xcite of a single photon .",
    "these operations enable to generate highly non - classical superpositions of coherent states @xcite , and distill and concentrate continuous - variable entanglement @xcite .",
    "if these operations are combined with coherent displacement , it is possible to prepare an arbitrary single - mode state of light from initial vacuum or squeezed state @xcite .    as both single - photon subtraction and addition",
    "have been successfully demonstrated experimentally , it is interesting to investigate whether these elementary transformations can be combined to engineer some more complex useful quantum operations on the states of traveling light beams . in this paper",
    "we propose and analyze scheme for approximate probabilistic realization of an arbitrary operation that can be expressed as a function of photon number operator @xmath0 .",
    "this class of transformations includes for instance the kerr nonlinearity described by a unitary operation @xmath1 , or a noiseless linear amplifier @xcite @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the amplification gain .",
    "our proposal is inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , where a scheme that coherently combines photon subtraction and addition has been devised for the purpose of direct verification of the bosonic commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we show that this scheme can be generalized to realize arbitrary operation @xmath4 .",
    "an essential advantage of our approach is that we preserve the relative simplicity of the setup discussed in ref .",
    "the scheme involves only a single mach - zehnder interferometer and a single nonlinear crystal where parametric down - conversion occurs .",
    "the precision of the approximation of a given operation @xmath4 is controlled by the number of photons @xmath5 counted by two photo - detection blocks that form a part of the setup .",
    "in contrast , other proposals for emulation of operations @xmath4 require either serial @xcite or parallel @xcite implementation of many basic building blocks .",
    "our approach is thus appealing from the experimental point of view , especially given that the core scheme has already been successfully realized experimentally by zavatta , bellini and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the proposed scheme and show how to determine its parameters for a given target operation @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "iii we consider approximate realization of a noiseless amplification . in .",
    "iv we study the emulation of kerr nonlinearity . finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . v.",
    "the scheme for probabilistic implementation of an arbitrary transformation @xmath4 that can be expressed as a function of photon number operator @xmath0 is depicted in fig .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , this scheme is very similar to the setup proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for experimental testing of the bosonic commutation relation for annihilation and creation operators , @xmath6=1 $ ] . here",
    "we consider a generalized version of that setup where @xmath5 photons are added to and also @xmath5 photons are subtracted from the input state .    .",
    "the scheme consists of unbalanced beam splitters bs@xmath7 and bs@xmath8 , polarizing beam splitter pbs , half - wave plate hwp , mirror m , nonlinear crystal nlc pumped by a strong laser pulse p , and two detection blocks d@xmath7 and d@xmath8 .",
    "the detection block @xmath9 counts the number of photons in mode @xmath10 .",
    "detection block @xmath11 projects the state in mode @xmath12 onto a specific entangled @xmath5-photon polarization state . for more details , see text . ]",
    "the photon addition is achieved by feeding the state into the input signal port of a nonlinear crystal nlc where pairs of correlated signal and idler photons are generated in the process of noncollinear parametric down - conversion pumped by a strong coherent laser beam p @xcite .",
    "the photodetector d@xmath7 counts the number of emitted idler photons @xmath5 which is equal to the number of photons added into the signal mode .",
    "photon counting can be achieved e.g. by employing the time - multiplexed photon number resolving detector @xcite where the input pulse is divided into a sequence of many pulses by highly unbalanced interferometers .",
    "the time - separated pulses then impinge onto avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) and the total number of clicks of apds gives the number of counted photons n. the main limitations of this detection scheme are the finite number of time bins which does not allow for complete photon number resolution , and the non - unit detection efficiency of the apds",
    ". however , these limitations are not very restrictive for the present application where the down - conversion should be operated in a regime of low gain .",
    "the probability that @xmath13 photons are present in the output idler beam is then much lower than the probability that @xmath5 photons are present .",
    "if @xmath5 photons are counted by d@xmath7 then , with high probability , @xmath5 photons were indeed emitted into the idler mode in nlc . in this regime ,",
    "the main effect of the less - than - unit detection efficiency of apds is a reduction of success probability of the scheme .",
    "mathematically , the state transformation after propagation through the crystal is described by the two - mode squeezing operator , @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the annihilation operators of signal and idler modes , respectively , and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the squeezing constant . assuming that the idler mode is initially in the vacuum state and that the detector d@xmath7 registers @xmath5 photons",
    ", the conditional transformation of the state of signal mode reads @xmath19 in the limit of low parametric gain , @xmath20 , we obtain @xmath21 as desired .",
    "the photon subtraction is performed by splitting a tiny part of the signal beam off a highly unbalanced beam splitter followed by detection of the number of reflected photons @xcite .",
    "if @xmath22 photons are reflected from a beam splitter with amplitude transmittance @xmath23 and reflectance @xmath24 then the conditional transformation of the signal - mode state can be expressed as follows , @xmath25 a crucial feature of the scheme in fig .",
    "1 is that the photon subtraction may occur either before or after the photon addition .",
    "the photons reflected off beam splitters bs@xmath7 and bs@xmath8 are recombined on a polarizing beam splitter pbs such that their polarization states are orthogonal but all other degrees of freedom are made indistinguishable to guarantee maximum visibility of multiphoton interference .",
    "the detector d@xmath8 represents a detection block that is capable of making projection onto an @xmath5-photon polarization state @xmath26 where h and v denote the horizontally and vertically linearly polarized modes , respectively .",
    "such a projection can be performed e.g. by reversing a linear optical scheme for preparation of the @xmath5-photon two - mode states put forward in ref .",
    "the input light beam is divided into @xmath5 spatial modes and a polarization analysis is performed on each mode by an elementary detection block consisting of quarter- and half - wave plates , polarizing beam splitter and a pair of single photon detectors . if a single photon is detected by each detection block , and a photon in the @xmath27-th detection block is projected onto a polarization state @xmath28 then the whole detector projects onto @xmath5-photon polarization state @xcite @xmath29 here @xmath30 , @xmath31 denote creation operators of the horizontally and vertically polarized modes , respectively .",
    "since every @xmath5-photon polarization state can be expressed in the factorized form ( [ phifactorized ] ) , this detection scheme can project onto any state ( [ phib ] ) .",
    "if @xmath5 photons in total are subtracted by bs@xmath7 and bs@xmath8 and if addition of n photons is heralded by the detector d@xmath7 , then the operation on signal mode a and the @xmath5-photon polarization state of auxiliary spatial mode b are given by , @xmath32 with a slight abuse of notation , we use in eq .",
    "( [ sas ] ) the tensor product symbol @xmath33 to separate operator acting on the hilbert space of the signal mode and the @xmath5-photon state prepared in the auxiliary mode b. after projecting the mode b onto the n - photon state ( [ phib ] ) we finally obtain the operation on signal mode , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 . with the help of the expression @xmath37",
    "we can rewrite @xmath38 as follows , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a polynomial of @xmath5-th order in @xmath0 , @xmath41    we now prove that by properly tailoring the state ( [ phib ] ) , arbitrary polynomial @xmath40 can be obtained .",
    "we start from eq .",
    "( [ wnformula ] ) where we normally order the creation and annihilation operators using the formula , @xmath42 in this way we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 by setting @xmath46 , @xmath47 , we can express the relation between @xmath48 and @xmath49 in a matrix form , @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the system of equations ( [ dmc ] ) for @xmath49 can be always solved . since @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , we have @xmath55 , @xmath56 exists and we can write @xmath57 .",
    "any polynomial in @xmath0 can be recast into the form ( [ pnnormal ] ) by normally ordering the annihilation and creation operators and the coefficients @xmath58 thus unambiguously specify the polynomial .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath49 yielding the required @xmath48 can be calculated as described above which completes the engineering of the operator polynomial @xmath40 .    to summarize our findings so far",
    ", we have shown that with the scheme shown in fig .",
    "1 we can implement an arbitrary operator that can be expressed as a product of a polynomial in @xmath0 and an attenuation factor @xmath59 ( recall that @xmath60 ) .",
    "the scheme can approximate any given operator @xmath4 to arbitrarily high degree @xmath5 determined by the number of photon subtractions and additions .",
    "more specifically , the first @xmath13 terms in taylor series expansion in @xmath0 of @xmath4 and @xmath38 can be made equal up to a constant prefactor .",
    "however , the success probability of the scheme will decrease approximately exponentially with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "practical implementations of the proposed scheme in a near future would be thus most probably limited to @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    in this low - approximation regime",
    "the influence of the attenuation factor @xmath59 could be particularly significant .",
    "this effective attenuation can be suppressed by employing highly unbalanced beam splitters , @xmath63 , and working in the regime of very low parametric gain , @xmath64 .",
    "then we get @xmath65 .",
    "however , in this limit the success probability of the scheme becomes very low and vanishes when @xmath66 or @xmath67 . in an experiment ,",
    "optimal balance between success rate and performance of the scheme can be sought by tuning @xmath68 and @xmath23 .",
    "as a first application of the scheme let us consider probabilistic implementation of a noiseless linear amplifier @xcite , @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes an amplitude gain of the amplifier .",
    "the amplifier ( [ zamplifier ] ) acts as a non - unitary quantum filter that enhances amplitudes of the fock states @xmath71 by a factor @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , this transformation can not be implemented exactly with a finite probability because the operator @xmath73 is unbounded for any @xmath70 .",
    "we can nevertheless approximately realize the transformation to @xmath5-th order in @xmath0 by the scheme described in a previous section .",
    "in essence in this approach the amplification works well for low fock states @xmath71 , @xmath74 , but it fails for large fock states @xmath75 .    for the sake of simplicity , in what follows",
    "we shall assume that @xmath76 , i.e. the limit of a low reflectance of beam splitters bs@xmath7 , bs@xmath8 and low gain of the nonlinear crystal .",
    "the influence of @xmath77 on the performance of the amplifier is that it reduces the effective gain , @xmath78 .",
    "this can be compensated by substitution @xmath79 when determining the parameters of the scheme .     of the probabilistic amplifier on the amplitude of coherent state @xmath80",
    "is plotted for five different nominal values of the gain , @xmath81 and for two levels of approximation @xmath61 ( a ) and @xmath62 ( b ) . ]     for five different gains @xmath81 and for @xmath61 ( a ) and @xmath62 ( b ) . ]",
    "we can construct a polynomial approximation to the operator @xmath73 by expanding it in taylor series in @xmath0 and keeping the first @xmath13 terms . in this way we obtain a polynomial @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "an important feature of the amplifier ( [ zamplifier ] ) is that it preserves the structure of coherent states and only amplifies their amplitude , @xmath84 .",
    "it turns out that the gain of the approximate amplifier ( [ znapproximation ] ) depends on @xmath80 and we can define an effective gain of the amplifier , @xmath85 it is natural to require that @xmath86 in the limit @xmath87 .",
    "this can be achieved if we set @xmath88 to be equal to a root of a polynomial equation @xmath89 as a concrete example we now study in more detail the cases @xmath61 and @xmath62 that are experimentally feasible with current technology . for @xmath61",
    "we find that @xmath90 and the approximate polynomial reads @xmath91 for @xmath62 we must solve a quadratic equation for @xmath88 which yields @xmath92 and @xmath93 on inserting the operators ( [ z1amplifier ] ) and ( [ z2amplifier ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ geffdefinition ] ) we can derive analytical formulas for the effective gain .",
    "for @xmath61 we obtain @xmath94}{1+(g^2 - 1)|\\alpha|^2+(g-1)^2|\\alpha|^4}.\\ ] ] the expression for @xmath62 is rather long and unwieldy and is not reproduced here . instead",
    ", we plot in fig .",
    "2 the dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath80 for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and for five different nominal values of the gain . we can see that the effective gain decreases with increasing @xmath80 .",
    "also , the performance of the scheme improves when higher - order approximation is employed , and we find that for @xmath62 the effective gain @xmath95 is closer to @xmath96 than for @xmath61 .",
    "besides the effective gain , we also calculate the fidelity of the amplified weak coherent state with the ideal target state , @xmath97 we plot the fidelity as a function of coherent state amplitude in fig .",
    "3 . for the considered range of parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "the fidelity exceeds @xmath100 for @xmath61 and surpasses @xmath101 for @xmath62 .",
    "the scheme is thus very suitable for probabilistic error - free quantum cloning of weak coherent states via noiseless amplification .    ,",
    "@xmath102 , @xmath61 ( solid line ) , and @xmath62 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "another important application of a noiseless amplifier is the concentration of continuous variable entanglement @xcite .",
    "consider a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the two - mode squeezing constant .",
    "local noiseless amplification of one mode increases the two - mode squeezing , @xmath106 , and thus enhances the entanglement of the state .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the approximate amplifications ( [ z1amplifier ] ) and ( [ z2amplifier ] ) on the entangled state ( [ psiab ] ) by means of numerical calculations . in the simulations we assume the limit @xmath102 .",
    "generally , the attenuation factor @xmath59 can be accounted for by replacing @xmath105 with rescaled squeezing constant @xmath107 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  4 that shows the dependence of fidelity and entanglement of the amplified state on gain @xmath96 for @xmath108 which corresponds to @xmath109  db of two - mode squeezing .",
    "we can see that the amplification enhances the state entanglement as expected , while preserving well the structure of the state as witnessed by high fidelity .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "5 where we plot the fock - state probability amplitudes @xmath110 of a state locally amplified by operations @xmath111 and @xmath112 with @xmath113 , as well as the amplitudes of the initial two - mode squeezed vacuum state and the ideal amplified two - mode squeezed vacuum state with squeezing constant @xmath114 .     by noiseless amplification . for each @xmath115 , the four bars from the left to the right correspond to the following states : initial two - mode squeezed state with squeezing constant @xmath105 ( blue ) , state amplified by operation @xmath111 ( red ) , state amplified by operation @xmath112 ( green ) , target two - mode squeezed state with squeezing constant @xmath114 ( black ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath108 and @xmath113 . ]",
    "the kerr effect is a consequence of a nonlinear response of a medium whose index of refraction depends on the intensity of the light field .",
    "quantum mechanically , this can be described by a hamiltonian proportional to the square of photon number operator .",
    "the resulting unitary transformation reads , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a dimensionless nonlinear phase shift .",
    "kerr nonlinearity can be used to generate highly non - classical states of light beams and , together with gaussian operations , it is sufficient for universal quantum computing @xcite . with the scheme described in sec .",
    "ii we can implement an approximate truncated version of the transformation ( [ u ] ) , @xmath118 we can generalize this expression to compensate for the attenuation factor @xmath59 up to @xmath119-th order by taking truncated taylor series of operator @xmath120 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes hermite polynomial . in what follows we shall assume the limit @xmath102 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "emulation of kerr nonlinearity is more resource - demanding than noiseless amplification , because already the first non - trivial approximation requires subtraction and addition of two photons , @xmath123 the unitary matrix @xmath124 is diagonal in fock state basis , with matrix elements @xmath125 .",
    "the matrix representing the approximate operation ( [ u2 ] ) is also diagonal in fock state basis but we find that @xmath126 , where @xmath127",
    ". the nonlinear phase shift @xmath128 does not increase quadratically with @xmath115 as it should but becomes saturated , @xmath129 .",
    "another aspect of the approximation ( [ u2 ] ) is that the fock state amplitudes are modulated by the factors @xmath130 so the transformation acts also as an amplifier .",
    "these features are illustrated in fig .",
    "( blue triangles ) and amplitude modulation factors @xmath131 ( green squares ) induced by the transformation ( [ u2 ] ) emulating kerr nonlinearity with @xmath132 .",
    "also shown for comparison is the phase shift @xmath133 corresponding to the true kerr nonlinearity ( [ u ] ) ( red circles ) . ]",
    "we quantify the performance of the approximate operation ( [ u2 ] ) by the quantum process fidelity .",
    "since the hilbert space of a field mode is infinite dimensional , we shall consider fidelity @xmath134 of operation restricted to a finite dimensional subspace spanned by the first @xmath13 fock states @xmath135 .",
    "we define maximally entangled state on this subspace @xmath136 and we have @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the identity operation .",
    "figure  7 shows the dependence of the fidelities @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 on the phase shift @xmath117 .",
    "we can see that with growing @xmath117 it is increasingly more and more difficult to emulate @xmath124 by @xmath142 and the fidelities @xmath134 decrease rapidly .     on the nonlinear phase shift @xmath117",
    "is plotted for @xmath62 ( solid line ) , @xmath143 ( dashed line ) and @xmath144 ( dotted line ) . ]    this problem of fidelity decrease can be remedied if we need to emulate the kerr nonlinearity only on a finite dimensional subspace spanned by the first @xmath13 fock states .",
    "more generally , any operation @xmath4 can be perfectly probabilistically implemented on such subspace if we construct the polynomial approximation to this operation as follows , @xmath145 note that this expression includes compensation for the attenuation factor @xmath146 .",
    "in particular , on inserting @xmath147 and @xmath62 into eq .",
    "( [ fprimen ] ) we obtain the following polynomial that perfectly emulates kerr nonlinearity on a three - dimensional subspace spanned by fock states @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , @xmath151",
    "an important practical characteristics of the proposed device that we have not addressed in detail yet is its success probability .",
    "a simple order - of - magnitude estimate reads @xmath152 , where @xmath153 denotes the detection efficiency of single - photon detectors .",
    "the quantum efficiencies of apds exceed @xmath154 .",
    "however , in the experiment , the optical beams typically need to be spatially and spectrally filtered before detection which reduces the overall detection efficiency to @xmath155 or even less .",
    "another important characteristics is the attenuation factor @xmath36 .",
    "we want to maximize @xmath156 while keeping @xmath146 as close to @xmath157 as possible . to give a concrete example , we can set @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "for @xmath61 we obtain @xmath161 and @xmath162 . pumping the scheme with a pulsed ti : sapphire laser with a repetition rate of @xmath163 mhz",
    "would then yield approximately @xmath164 events per second .",
    "second - order approximation , @xmath62 , is much more challenging . for the above parameters we obtain success rate @xmath165 hz , i.e. about @xmath109 events per minute which may be still acceptable for proof - of - principle experiments .",
    "moreover , this rate can be significantly increased either by improving the detection efficiency or by using beam splitters with higher transmittance @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , with @xmath166 and @xmath167 we obtain success rate @xmath109 hz and @xmath168 .",
    "we stress that the calculated success rates are only order - of - magnitude estimates and would depend on the input state of the scheme as well as on details of the implemented transformation .",
    "nevertheless , these calculations clearly confirm the experimental feasibility of the scheme with single photon addition and subtraction and show that scheme with two photon additions and subtractions may be within the reach of present technology .    in summary , we have described and analyzed a scheme that allows to probabilistically implement arbitrary single - mode operation that can be expressed as a function of photon number operator .",
    "the method relies on coherent combination of multiple photon subtraction and addition and is experimentally feasible with present - day technology @xcite .",
    "as concrete examples , we have shown that the scheme can work as a probabilistic noiseless amplifier and can emulate kerr nonlinearity .",
    "the scheme is very versatile and can find many applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing such as implementation of quantum gates , probabilistic error - free quantum cloning , or entanglement distillation .",
