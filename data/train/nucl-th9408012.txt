    "during the last few years there has been renewed interest in the physics of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "new data on @xmath1-production in different reactions are becoming available .",
    "for example , the photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons is being studied at mami @xcite and elsa @xcite , while @xmath1-production in hadronic and heavy - ion collisions is under investigation at saturne @xcite and gsi @xcite , respectively .",
    "calculations of these processes have been performed by several groups ( see e.g.  refs .  [ 5 - 9 ] ) .",
    "the ultimate aim of our investigation is a better understanding of the @xmath1-properties in an hadronic environment and the possible consequences for @xmath1-production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , before attacking the relatively complex problem of medium effects , we need a better understanding of more elementary processes , like e.g. @xmath1-production in hadronic collisions and in photo - induced reactions .",
    "new accurate data on these processes will in the near future provide very useful constraints on models for the elementary @xmath1-meson  hadron interactions and the properties of the @xmath1-meson at normal nuclear matter density and below .",
    "the investigation of possible @xmath1-meson bound states in nuclei could also yield information on @xmath1-meson  nucleon interactions at low densities @xcite . since the @xmath1-meson couples strongly to the s@xmath2(1535 ) resonance ,",
    "the in - medium properties of the @xmath1-meson and this resonance are strongly interdependent .",
    "thus , @xmath1-production on nuclei also probes the in - medium properties of the s@xmath2(1535 ) resonance .",
    "a useful framework for the study of hadrons in nuclear matter is an effective field theory with hadronic degrees of freedom . in such theories one needs as input the hadronic coupling constants .",
    "it is the aim of this letter to construct a model for pion - induced @xmath1-production on the nucleon .",
    "the parameters , in particular the @xmath1nn@xmath3 coupling constant , are determined by fitting data on elastic @xmath0n scattering .",
    "the consistency of our model is then checked by comparing the cross section for the inelastic channel @xmath0n@xmath8n with experiment .",
    "the present calculation is a first step in a systematic investigation of @xmath1-interactions with hadrons and hadronic matter , as outlined above .",
    "pion - nucleon scattering in the s@xmath2 channel at center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies below @xmath91.8  gev involves two n@xmath3 resonances @xcite .",
    "the lower one , the s@xmath2(1535 ) resonance , decays into @xmath0n , @xmath1n and @xmath10n with the branching ratios 3555@xmath11 , 3050@xmath11 and 520@xmath11 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the upper one , i.e. the s@xmath2(1650 ) , couples strongly to the @xmath0n and @xmath10n channels with branching ratios of 6080@xmath11 and 520@xmath11 , respectively , but only weakly to the @xmath1n channel with a probability of approximately 1@xmath11 .    in order to describe these experimental facts",
    "we include the following interaction terms in the lagrangian :    @xmath12    the first line contains the interaction terms of the linear sigma - model @xcite which is chirally invariant and describes low - energy @xmath0n scattering reasonably well . in this model",
    "the following relations between the coupling constants hold : @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the masses of @xmath17 , @xmath0 and nucleon , respectively .",
    "the interaction terms in the second line describe the @xmath0nn@xmath3 interaction for the two n@xmath3 resonances ( n@xmath18s@xmath2(1535 ) , n@xmath19s@xmath2(1650 ) ) whereas those in the third line account for the @xmath1nn@xmath20 coupling .",
    "the weak @xmath1nn@xmath21 and @xmath1nn couplings are neglected @xcite .    in principle , one could attempt to describe the @xmath10n decay of the s@xmath2 resonances by the two - step process n@xmath22n .",
    "this would require only two additional coupling terms of the resonances to the @xmath17n channel .",
    "the subsequent decay of the @xmath17 into two pions would be described by the third term in ( 1 ) .",
    "however , there are other intermediate states , like @xmath23n and @xmath24 , which also contribute to the @xmath10n decay channel and should be handled on the same footing as the @xmath17n process .",
    "thus , a proper treatment of this decay channel , which plays a somewhat peripheral role in our investigation , would be unduly complex .",
    "consequently , we choose a phenomenological approach , where the physical two - pion continuum is parametrized by means of an effective scalar field @xmath25 of positive parity , mass m@xmath26=400 mev and zero width .",
    "the field @xmath25 interacts only through the @xmath25nn@xmath3 couplings , which are given in the last line of ( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4-matrix is related to the @xmath5-matrix by the integral equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 describes the free motion of the two particles in one of the three coupled channels @xmath0n , @xmath1n and @xmath25n .",
    "the @xmath5-matrix can be derived from the lagrangian by solving another , more complicated , integral equation . however , since any approximation , which leaves the @xmath5-matrix hermitian , yields a unitary @xmath29-matrix @xcite , we circumvent this step by identifying the @xmath5-matrix elements with the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 ( c.f .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the tree approximation to the linear @xmath17-model the direct and crossed nucleon pole terms and the @xmath17-exchange term",
    "are included @xcite .",
    "these terms , the so called born terms , correspond to the first three diagrams of @xmath30 in fig .  1 .",
    "we also include the direct contributions from the resonances .",
    "the corresponding crossed diagrams are suppressed due to the large masses in intermediate states .    in the diagrams for the @xmath5-matrix",
    "the intermediate state particles propagate with their physical masses but with zero widths ; e.g. , for the s@xmath2(1535 ) resonance in the intermediate state the corresponding inverse propagator is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is real .",
    "the summation of the processes implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) generates the imaginary parts needed to satisfy unitarity , and consequently also the correct resonance widths . in this approximation the @xmath5-matrix , defined by the diagrams in fig .  1 , is obviously free of divergences . since the intermediate meson - nucleon states in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are restricted to be on - shell , this also applies to the @xmath4-matrix .",
    "consequently , there is no need to renormalize e.g.  the coupling constants .",
    "furthermore , since the integral equation ( [ eq : d ] ) reduces to an algebraic one after projection on partial waves , one can , given a suitable approximation to the @xmath5-matrix , write down the @xmath4-matrix analytically .",
    "we introduce form factors for the off - shell nucleon at the @xmath0nn vertex @xcite @xmath33 and for the off - shell @xmath17-meson at the @xmath34 and @xmath17nn vertices @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the 4-momenta of the off - shell nucleon and @xmath17-meson , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4-matrix in the s@xmath2 channel is obtained by projecting eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) onto total angular momentum @xmath38 , isospin @xmath39 and negative parity .",
    "since the @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons have negative parity , only @xmath40 for the relative angular momentum is allowed in the @xmath0n and @xmath1n intermediate states . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath25n intermediate state must be p - wave , since the @xmath25-meson has positive parity . with our choice of form",
    "factors the projection can be done analytically .",
    "the resulting @xmath4-matrix can be given in closed form .",
    "however , since the full expression , keeping all three channels is quite lengthy , we do not present it here .",
    "instead , we show the solution for the simpler case , where the @xmath10n channel is neglected . for elastic @xmath0n scattering in the s@xmath2 channel",
    "we then find @xmath41\\left[k^b w + \\beta\\right]+\\alpha w}{\\left[f(k)\\gamma - v\\right ) ] \\left[f(q)(k^b w+\\beta)-w\\right]-\\alpha w f(q)}\\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the invariant mass in the @xmath0n channel .",
    "the absolute values of the relative three - momenta in the c.m .- system of the @xmath0n and @xmath1n system are denoted by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath32 and @xmath46 denote the masses of the two resonances and @xmath47 .",
    "the other quantities are given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the projection of the non - resonant @xmath0n born terms onto the s@xmath2 channel is denoted by @xmath51 . in order to obtain the empirical scattering lengths in the tree approximation to the linear @xmath17-model , the @xmath0nn coupling constant",
    "must be renormalized @xcite .",
    "this renormalization , which effectively accounts for loop corrections , is usually done by fixing the axial coupling constant to its empirical value @xmath52 .",
    "we choose a pragmatic approach and adjust the effective @xmath0nn coupling constant to the s - wave @xmath0n scattering length @xmath53 for isospin=1 in the t - channel , where the @xmath17-exchange term does not contribute .",
    "the mass of the @xmath17-meson is then fixed by the isospin=0 scattering length @xmath54 .",
    "the remaining five coupling constants as well as the masses of the two resonances are then determined by fitting the elastic @xmath0n - scattering data up to @xmath55 1.84 gev .",
    "there are several partial - wave analyses of the @xmath0n - scattering data available .",
    "we employ the solutions obtained by hhler and the karlsruhe - helsinki group @xcite and by cutkosky and the cmu - lbl group @xcite .",
    "in our least - square fit we find a fairly shallow , but nevertheless clear minimum .",
    "the resulting parameter sets are given in table 1 in rows 1 and 2 .",
    "+    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath0nn coupling constant @xmath56=8.99 which corresponds to @xmath57 , and the @xmath17-meson mass @xmath58=640 mev are fixed by fitting the scattering lengths , as described above .",
    "the cutoff masses @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev are determined by fitting the data below the first resonance .",
    "we note that the two fits are of similar quality and yield very similar parameter sets . in figs .  2 and 3 we show the fit to the karlsruhe - helsinki solution which is well reproduced up to and including the energy range of the second resonance .",
    "the discrepancy at energies beyond @xmath62= 1.75 gev is most likely due to other resonances , not included in our model .    since the presence of form factors complicates the question of gauge invariance e.g.  in the process",
    "@xmath63 , we have also made a fit to the karlsruhe - helsinki solution without a form factor at the @xmath0nn vertex .",
    "this fit ( c.f .",
    "2 and 3 ) deviates appreciably from the other ones only at high energies ( @xmath64 1.75  gev ) .",
    "the corresponding parameters are given in the third row of table 1 .",
    "as a further test of the model we have also calculated the cross section for the process @xmath65 @xmath66 the @xmath4-matrix element @xmath67 is approximated by its l=0 component obtained in our model . in fig .",
    "4 the resulting cross section is compared with the experimental data compiled in ref .",
    "we find good agreement in the energy range of the s@xmath2(1535 ) resonance . at higher energies contributions of higher lying resonances",
    "become important ( see below ) .",
    "the s@xmath2(1650 ) resonance , which was not included in previous models @xcite , plays an important role both in elastic @xmath0n scattering and @xmath1-production .",
    "the coupling strengths of one resonance are affected by the presence of the other one , since the two resonances overlap due to their relatively large widths . at an isolated resonance",
    "the real part generally goes through zero near the resonance energy .",
    "the behaviour of the real part of the @xmath4-matrix in the s@xmath2 channel can only be described by taking two overlapping resonances into account .",
    "furthermore , the upper resonance , although it couples only weakly to the @xmath1-meson , plays a crucial role in the determination of @xmath68 . in order to demonstrate this , we have repeated the fit in a reduced model , where the upper resonance is neglected .",
    "a reasonable description of the data can be obtained for energies below @xmath6 = 1.55 gev , where one would expect only a small contribution from the s@xmath2(1650 ) . however , compared to the complete model we find a strong increase of both coupling constants ( @xmath69 = 0.80 and @xmath70 = 2.38 ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1-production data can not be described within the reduced model ; at its maximum the cross section is about 40 % too large .",
    "we have constructed a model for @xmath0n scattering in the elastic as well as in the major inelastic s@xmath2 channels .",
    "the parameters of the model are determined by fitting only data for elastic scattering .",
    "our best fit yields @xmath70  =  2.10 , which differs considerably from the values obtained in most earlier calculations [ 5,10,21 ] .",
    "@xcite find a value close to ours by fitting the partial decay widths of the s@xmath2 resonance .",
    "however , we caution the reader that the coupling constants discussed here , in particular @xmath68 , may be model dependent ( see e.g. the discussion at the end of section 4 ) .",
    "we find a total width of the s@xmath2(1535 ) of 162  mev with branching ratios of 55@xmath11 to @xmath1n , 41@xmath11 to @xmath0n and 4@xmath11 to @xmath10n , respectively .",
    "the s@xmath2(1650 ) decays with 77@xmath11 to @xmath0n and with 23@xmath11 to @xmath10n , with a total width of 293  mev .",
    "the branching ratios of both resonances and the width of the s@xmath2(1535 ) are consistent with the values given by the particle data group @xcite , while the width of the s@xmath2(1650 ) is larger .",
    "we note , however , that the resonance parameters , in particular the width , strongly depend upon the treatment of the background .",
    "for example , in the reduced model , where the upper resonance is neglected , the total width of the s@xmath2(1535 ) is 204 mev .",
    "the resonance parameters quoted in @xcite are determined in a parametrization , which includes a phenomenological background . in our model",
    ", this background is , at least in part , included in the large width of the s@xmath2(1650 ) .    in order to explore",
    "how reliable our determination of @xmath70 is , we have performed constrained fits , where this coupling constant was fixed to the values 1.9 and 2.3 .",
    "the quality of the fit to the elastic @xmath4-matrix is slightly worse than in the optimal case . in the figs .  2 and 3 these fits are almost indistinguishable from the original fit .",
    "however , the cross section for @xmath1-production depends strongly on the value of @xmath70 .",
    "this is illustrated by the band in fig .  4 , where the upper edge corresponds to @xmath70  =  2.3 and the lower edge to @xmath70  =  1.9 .",
    "thus , the optimal fit to the elastic @xmath0n - scattering @xmath4-matrix yields a good description for the inelastic @xmath1-production channel _ without any further adjustment of parameters_.    at energies beyond the s@xmath2(1535 ) , the calculated @xmath1-production cross section is too low .",
    "the missing cross section is probably due to higher lying resonances , not included in our model .",
    "the coupling to the p@xmath2(1440 ) and d@xmath71(1520 ) , which have been studied previously , seems to be rather weak @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our model , where there is little room for additional contributions at energies below 1.55  gev .",
    "the next resonance which couples strongly to the @xmath1-meson @xcite is the p@xmath2(1710 ) .",
    "a rough estimate of its contribution is obtained by using @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 = 1.71  gev is the resonance energy and @xmath74 and @xmath75 = 50 - 250  mev are the partial and total widths of the p@xmath2(1710 ) .",
    "we use @xmath75 = 200 mev , while for the branching ratios we take the maximum values @xcite",
    "@xmath76  =  0.2 and @xmath77  =  0.4 .",
    "the energy dependence of the widths is accounted for by multiplying @xmath74 and @xmath75 by the corresponding phase - space factors . adding this contribution to the cross section yields the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "4 .    in summary , we have performed a coupled - channel calculation of @xmath0n scattering in the s@xmath2 channel including born diagrams and the two resonances s@xmath2(1535 ) and s@xmath2(1650 ) .",
    "the parameters of our model were determined by fitting the @xmath4-matrix for elastic @xmath0n scattering to empirical data .",
    "an excellent fit is obtained for all energies up to @xmath6 = 1.75 gev .",
    "furthermore , with the same parameters the total cross section for the inelastic process @xmath78 is also well reproduced in the region of the two resonances .",
    "our model can be used in calculations of other processes , e.g. photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons or @xmath1-production in hadronic and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "work on the photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons on protons is in progress .",
    "there the present model is used to describe the strong - interaction part of the @xmath4-matrix .",
    "we thank g.  hhler , m.  soyeur and w.  weise for valuable discussions ."
