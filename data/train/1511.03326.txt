    "the study of bifurcations in fluid and climate systems has attracted the attention of many researchers in connection with climate tipping point problems ( see @xcite for an overview ) and turbulence @xcite . in particular , in @xcite a hypothesis is pioneered that fluid turbulence can appear as a result of bifurcations from a simple dynamics to a chaotic dynamics .    in this paper , we show , in an analytical way , that some spatially inhomogeneous fluid systems are capable of exhibiting a large spectrum of complicated bifurcations . at a bifurcation point , we observe a transition from a steady state attractor to chaotic dynamics and complex spatio - temporal patterns , which are quasiperiodical in space and chaotic in time .",
    "these patterns describe coherent turbulent structures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] ) .",
    "we have an explicit analytic description of turbulent onset . in these turbulent patterns , the chaotic attractor dimension and dynamics",
    "are controllable by space inhomogeneities , and although that control is complicated , it is quite constructive .",
    "the dynamics at the bifurcation point is defined by so - called normal forms .",
    "we show that all kinds of structurally stable dynamics can appear as normal forms as we vary system space inhomogeneities .    to explain the physical ideas behind complicated mathematics and to understand this new bifurcation mechanism , let us recall the classical results on rayleigh - bnard and bnard - marangoni bifurcations .",
    "they show that , for simple linear temperature profiles @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the vertical coordinate , the bifurcation is a result of a single mode instability .",
    "this mode is periodic in @xmath2 with period @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a wave vector .",
    "the instability arises if , for a given @xmath4 , the real part @xmath5 of the eigenvalue @xmath6 corresponding to this mode goes through @xmath7 as a bifurcation parameter @xmath8 passes through a critical point @xmath9 . for @xmath10",
    "we determine that the trivial zero solution of fluid equations is stable , and for @xmath8 close to @xmath11 we find stable solutions describing periodical patterns .",
    "the amplitudes of these patterns can be found by a system of differential equations @xcite , which can be considered as a `` normal form '' of the system at the bifurcation point . that normal form determines the dynamics of slow modes in the system .",
    "the dynamics of the fast modes is captured , for large times , by slow modes @xcite . for many bifurcations",
    "the normal form is defined by a system with quadratic nonlinearities , since for small amplitudes the main nonlinear contributions are quadratic @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the marangoni case , an analysis of this system shows that the system bifurcates into two steady state solutions , which are local attractors @xcite .",
    "we use a new scheme to obtain much more complicated bifurcations and attractors .",
    "this scheme is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ pic ] .    1 .",
    "first , the number of slow modes @xmath12 is controllable by the space inhomogeneity .",
    "these slow modes are associated with eigenfunctions @xmath13 of a linear operator that describe linearization of system .",
    "the functions @xmath13 are defined by different wave vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath14 are completely controlled by the system space inhomogeneity .",
    "we can get any sets of @xmath14 .",
    "lastly , the quadratic normal form is also completely controllable by the space inhomogeneities .",
    "we can obtain any quadratic system by a variation of system space inhomogeneities .",
    "the key point ( iii ) allows us to exhibit the existence of chaotic dynamics .",
    "this is found in @xcite , where it is shown that all kinds of structurally stable dynamics can be generated by quadratic systems .",
    "thus , all structurally stable dynamics can appear as a result of bifurcations .",
    "such bifurcations can be named _",
    "superbifurcations_.    note that space inhomogeneities consist of two terms .",
    "the first term is basic and depends on the vertical coordinate @xmath1 only .",
    "an appropriate choice of this term leads to realization of points ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the second term is small with respect to the first but depends on both vertical and horizontal coordinates .",
    "variations of this term allow us to control the normal forms .",
    "the fact that the normal forms sharply depend on small inhomogeneities may be interesting for climate theory .",
    "indeed , we need points ( i ) and ( ii ) to create a number of slow modes whereas a possibility of complex interactions between these modes follows from ( iii ) .",
    "a typical climate system involves a number of slow modes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can expect that in such systems small space inhomogeneities can lead to complex bifurcations .",
    "this property may be important for tipping point theory , which , up to now , considered relatively simple bifurcations in simplified models ( see @xcite for an overview ) .    in this paper , we consider local bifurcations only where the dynamics at the bifurcation point is weakly nonlinear .",
    "although we show the existence of complex phenomena and the appearance of chaotic attractors of all dimensions , fully nonlinear systems can also exhibit non - local bifurcations that are harder to describe by the analytical methods of this paper .",
    "however , one can expect that if even local bifurcations lead to all kinds of chaos of any dimension , then the same fact also holds for non - local ones .",
    "the solution methodology can be described as follows . according to standard bifurcation ideas , at the bifurcation",
    "point the system of solutions can be represented as sums of contributions of slow modes .",
    "each contribution is defined by the corresponding magnitude @xmath16 , which is a slow function of time @xmath17 .",
    "the spatial patterns corresponding to our solutions are complex , they are quasiperiodic in @xmath2 ( horizontal axis ) and localized at the surface .",
    "dynamics of the magnitude @xmath18 may be time periodic or even chaotic .",
    "we thus have complex coherent spatio - temporal patterns quasiperiodic in space , localized at the surface , and evolving in time in a complex manner ( see fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we can control the pattern structure and dynamics .",
    "the mathematical realization of that control is based on a vector - field realization approach ( the rvf method , see section [ rvf ] in the appendix and @xcite ) .",
    "this method was successfully applied to many dissipative systems of chemical kinetics and neural network theory . here",
    ", we first use the rvf for fluid dynamics .",
    "we believe that these ideas can be used for many systems , for example , for climate systems . indeed , climate systems include fast and slow variables and involves spatial inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the mechanism of generation of complex large time behaviour , outlined above , works in these systems .    in this paper , for simplicity , we study a toy model having physical applicability .",
    "we consider the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations for a non - compressible fluid with the marangoni boundary conditions in the two dimensional case .",
    "these equations describe hydrodynamical systems involving convection , heat transfer and capillarity , and exhibit interesting pattern formation effects @xcite ( for example , bnard cells studied in many works @xcite and references therein ) . as indicated in fig.[fig0 ] , the marangoni flows are driven by surface tension gradients . in general ,",
    "surface tension depends on both the temperature and chemical composition at an interface .",
    "therefore , these flows may be generated by gradients in either temperature or chemical concentrations .    in physical and chemical systems",
    "the marangoni effects are well - known and this may have potential applications for geosystems .",
    "for example , shallow permafrost lakes in tundra emit a huge amount of methane that affects the atmospheric dynamics and atmospheric thermodynamics .",
    "apparently , the `` surface tension '' in the system of permafrost lake patterns on the tundra s surface will define methane emission regimes @xcite .",
    "however , the marangoni effects also can influence large ecosystems , for example oceanic ones , if there are salinity gradients @xcite .",
    "in addition , the surface tension of green algal which bloom on the surface of big lakes in southeast asia ( and fully cover the lake surface ) , changes the internal physical and chemical properties of these lakes @xcite .",
    "finally , the surface tension at the air - water - sedimentary rock interface of geothermal hot springs defines the dynamics of water flows @xcite .",
    "an interesting situation , where these effects are essential , arises when there exist surfactants on the water surface .",
    "the capillary forces are also important for a correct description of air bubble motion . in this paper",
    ", we consider thermocapillary marangoni effects ; however , the same analysis is valid when these effects are induced by convection , capillary forces and diffusion , for example , by salinity gradients .",
    "our plan to find complicated bifurcations is as follows .",
    "let us first fix the fluid viscosity and all other parameters except the marangoni number @xmath8 , which serves as a bifurcation parameter .",
    "this marangoni parameter @xmath8 is the ratio of the destabilizing surface tension gradient to the forces generated by thermal and viscous diffusion @xcite .",
    "we consider general nonlinear profiles @xmath0 depending on the vertical coordinate only .",
    "first , we remove nonlinear terms and consider the corresponding linearized problem . as",
    "above , the eigenfunctions of this problem are periodic in @xmath2 with the period @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a wave vector . for example",
    ", the fluid stream function @xmath19 induced by these modes has the form @xmath20 . for large prandtl numbers we obtain an asymptotic equation for @xmath21 .",
    "the physical meaning of this equation is transparent ; for each wave vector the eigenvalue @xmath22 is defined by an interaction between the corresponding mode @xmath23 and the inhomogeneity @xmath0 .",
    "our goal is to find profiles @xmath0 for which the stability loss occurs simultaneously for many @xmath4 , i.e. , we have that the real parts @xmath5 pass through @xmath7 for all @xmath24 as @xmath8 goes through @xmath11 .",
    "the key idea in finding such profiles is as follows .",
    "first we find a profile @xmath25 such that the spectrum @xmath22 is independent of @xmath4 within a large interval of values @xmath4 .",
    "for example , we take @xmath26 as a step function , where a step localized at the surface @xmath27 , for example , at @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the depth of fluid layer",
    ". there are other possible kinds of @xmath26 , for example , exponential profiles . then the interaction between the fluid and the inhomogeneity @xmath30 weakly depends on the wave vector @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the stability loss will occur simultaneously for a number of @xmath4 ( see comment at the formulation of theorem [ 6.2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations and analytic arguments ( see sect . [ sec4 ] and fig . [ fig1 ] ) show that , for an appropriate @xmath9 , the quantities @xmath31 changes their sign at @xmath9 for a set of @xmath4 .",
    "then we take the profile @xmath30 as a weak perturbation of @xmath26 .",
    "this trick aims to attain two key goals :    * a * ) we obtain the stability loss at prescribed @xmath32 for each @xmath33 and these @xmath34 define wave vectors of slow modes ; * b * ) we shift all the other eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath35 towards the left half - plane @xmath36 and therefore the corresponding modes are fast .",
    "furthermore , we take into account nonlinear terms . at the bifurcation point , by standard methods of invariant manifold theory @xcite , we derive a system of differential equations with quadratic nonlinearities for mode magnitudes @xmath37 , @xmath38 , that is reminiscent of the lorenz system .",
    "previous results @xcite show that the corresponding dynamical system can have periodic or chaotic trajectories .",
    "note that the main technical mathematical difficulties are connected with points ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the application the method of realization of vector fields ( see appencix and @xcite ) of ( iii ) is standard .",
    "these mathematical results admit a simple physical interpretation .",
    "they describe a complex spatial pattern at a free water surface , which can be induced by a complicated profile of temperature or a chemical concentration at that surface .",
    "note that such profiles of salinity concentrations arise in real fluid systems ( see @xcite ) . to obtain the complicated profile ,",
    "we use spatially distributed inhomogeneous sources ; however , an analytical proof of the existence of even more complex solutions determined by a non - trivial temperature profile is obtained in paper @xcite for the case of a planar free bnard - marangoni convection .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate the marangoni problem . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce the main linear operator associated with the problem . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we investigate the spectrum of this operator , and we state the main new conclusion of the paper and its proof . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "the marangoni initial boundary value problem is reduced to a system of differential equations with quadratic nonlinearities describing the dynamics of the main modes at the bifurcation point ( it follows the standard technique , see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec7 ] we show that quadratic systems obtained in section [ sec5 ] can exhibit a chaotic large time behaviour .",
    "the appendix contains all complex mathematical proofs .",
    "in particular , section [ rvf ] considers the rvf method introduced by p. polik @xcite , which is an important tool for analytically proving the existence of chaos .",
    "we consider the navier - stokes system for an ideal incompressible fluid @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 are unknown functions defined on @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the strip @xmath46 \\subset { \\bf r^2}$ ] . here",
