    "it is generally believed that the structure in the universe emerged hierarchically from initially small density fluctuations .",
    "small fluctuations , which at present remain such only at very large smoothing scales , can be successfully described by the linear theory . on smaller scales however , nonlinear effects come into play and linear approximation is no longer valid . in the weakly nonlinear regime perturbative approach",
    "proved extremely successful in predicting the statistical properties of density fields at scales exceeding 10 @xmath1 mpc . in order to predict properties of single objects we must however trace the evolution of density up to strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "the price to pay is high : we have to restrict the analysis to one object neglecting its interactions with the neighbourhood .    the simplest deterministic model of strongly nonlinear evolution proposed by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) , called the spherical model , described the behaviour of a uniformly overdense region in the otherwise unperturbed , expanding universe .",
    "it was extended by gott ( 1975 ) and gunn ( 1977 ) to apply to the evolution of matter around an already collapsed density perturbation superposed on a homogeneous background .",
    "the main prediction of the model ( called the spherical accretion or the secondary infall model , hereafter sim ) was that the matter collapsing around the perturbation should form a halo with @xmath2 density profile .",
    "it is much more realistic to assume that the progenitors of structure were not the collapsed perturbations but the local maxima ( rare events ) in the density field which had initially gaussian probability distribution .",
    "this was the approach of hoffman & shaham ( 1985 , hereafter hs ) who applied sim to the hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "they assumed that the density peak dominates to some extent the surroundings causing the collapse of the material that is gravitationally bound to it .",
    "the initial density profile around the peak was approximated by the mean density predicted by the initial probability distribution which was assumed to be gaussian .",
    "hs considered scale - free initial power spectra of fluctuations in different cosmologies and found that the final profiles of halos steepen for higher spectral indices and lower density parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this kind of dependence on cosmological parameters was confirmed via the results of completely different approach to studies of structure formation : the @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "quinn , salmon & zurek ( 1986 ) , efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and more recently crone , evrard & richstone ( 1994 ) among others confirmed the analytical predictions by fitting power laws to the density profiles of dark matter halos resulting from their simulations .",
    "recently navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 , hereafter nfw ) performed a series of high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations for power - law initial spectra and found that the density profiles of dark halos in large range of masses can be fitted with a simple formula with only one fitting parameter .",
    "the density profile was observed to steepen from @xmath4 near the centre of the halo to @xmath5 at large distances .",
    "this confirmed earlier results of these authors obtained for cdm cosmologies .",
    "similar shapes of profiles were also observed by cole & lacey ( 1996 ) and tormen , bouchet & white ( 1997 ) in their @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "although the overall trend of steeper profiles for higher spectral indices and lower @xmath3 predicted by sim was confirmed , nfw claim that the changing slope of the profile is  at odds with the analytic predictions \" .",
    "in fact this is only true in the case of @xmath6 for which sim indeed predicts a power - law profile .",
    "however , for large ( i.e. close to 1 ) values of @xmath3 sim in the form proposed by hs is least reliable .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that sim describes the evolution of a single overdense region while in reality the halos forming at various locations compete for mass . as a result ,",
    "the mass accreted by an overdense region is not the whole mass which is gravitationally bound to it ( in the case of @xmath6 this mass is infinite ) .",
    "another limitation of sim comes from the statistical approach applied in determining the initial conditions : the initial density distribution has a finite coherence scale which also may influence the amount of mass accreted onto the peak .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a short presentation of sim in section  2 , in section  3 and 4 i outline proposed modifications to the model and in section  5 compare obtained halo density profiles to the results of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the discussion follows in section  6 .",
    "in the following i present the main assumptions and results of sim as applied to the density contrast field with initially gaussian probability distribution . this version of the model was first presented for the case of linear fields by hs and slightly modified by okas ( 1998 ) in attempt to take into account the weakly nonlinear corrections . in the following only the linear approximation will be used to determine initial conditions .",
    "the remaining assumptions and conventions will follow those of okas ( 1998 ) except for a change in notation introduced in order to conform to the widely accepted notation for the parameters of the universal profile .",
    "i will consider the einstein - de  sitter cosmological model with @xmath7 and zero cosmological constant .",
    "the initial probability distribution of the density field will be assumed to be gaussian .",
    "the initial density power spectrum will be modeled by the scale - free form @xmath8 with indices @xmath9 which are of biggest cosmological interest .",
    "the fields will be smoothed with a filter of a gaussian shape @xmath10 for such spectra and smoothing the density field can be characterized by the correlation coefficient @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ( auto)correlation function of the two values of the density fields ( smoothed at comoving scale @xmath13 ) at points separated by distance @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the distance in units of @xmath13 : @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the linear rms fluctuation at scale @xmath13 which in this case is given by @xmath18}{(2 \\pi)^{2 } r^{n+3}}\\ ] ] where the time dependence is @xmath19    let us assume that at @xmath20 we detect an overdense region of density equal to @xmath21 standard deviations : @xmath22 ( for high enough @xmath21 this is approximately equivalent to assuming there is a peak at @xmath20 ) .",
    "two - point probability distribution function then predicts that at distance @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 if we measure the distance in units of @xmath13 ) the expected density contrast is @xmath23 with @xmath24 given by equation ( [ p3 ] ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of matter at the distance @xmath25 from the peak is determined by the mean cumulative density perturbation within @xmath25 which is given by @xmath26 if we assume that @xmath27 the expected cumulative density can be approximated by @xmath28 the values of the numerical factor @xmath29 can be found in okas ( 1998 ) .",
    "a similar approximation for large @xmath25 was used by hs as the initial condition for their sim .",
    "the approximation at large @xmath25 in the form given above is accurate to within 10% for @xmath30 .",
    "the cumulative density contrast @xmath31 describes the initial density distribution around the peak . assuming that the cumulative density can be approximated by the mean , @xmath32 , sim can be used to predict the final density profile which will form after shells which are bound to the peak collapse onto it .",
    "the distance to the farthest shell which is bound to collapse is given by the condition of the vanishing energy @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the density parameter at some initial epoch at which we specify the initial density distribution .",
    "in the case of @xmath7 the scale @xmath35 of the gravitational influence of any overdense region is infinite , the region should therefore collect mass from the whole universe .    according to sim after virialization the shell @xmath25 ends up at @xmath36 where @xmath37 is",
    "the maximum radius given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the collapse factor , which in the case of scale free initial conditions for large @xmath25 , equation ( [ p8 ] ) , can be approximated by a constant of the order of @xmath40 ( see zaroubi & hoffman 1993 ) .",
    "the final density profile then follows from the conservation of mass @xmath41 if we approximate the initial density of the shell of radius @xmath25 @xmath42\\ ] ] by the background ( critical ) density @xmath43 and expand the right hand side of equation ( [ p9a ] ) in @xmath44 keeping only the linear term , we will end up with the power law density profile found by hs @xmath45 the density profiles will be expressed here as above in units of the present critical density to ensure direct comparison with the results of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "it is interesting to note that what is usually quoted as the prediction of sim for hierarchical clustering scenarios is the special case ( [ p9d ] ) which is valid only for @xmath7 . in the case of open universe",
    "the slope of the halo steepens gently with the distance from the centre starting with the slope ( [ p9d ] ) near the centre and approaching @xmath46 for shells close to the last bound shell .",
    "the case of @xmath47 will be treated in the follow - up paper .",
    "the main and most questionable assumptions underlying sim as formulated by hs are of course the spherical symmetry of the problem and the absence of peculiar velocities .",
    "i will keep the assumptions here and show that even with these simplifications the agreement between the model and the results of @xmath0-body simulations can be improved .",
    "first i propose to relinquish the large @xmath25 approximation for the @xmath48 , equation ( [ p8 ] ) applied by hs in their calculations .",
    "the general formula for the expected cumulative density contrast can be found using equations ( [ p3 ] ) , ( [ p5 ] ) and ( [ p6 ] ) @xmath49 .",
    "\\label{p7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the main reason for this generalization is that especially with the conditions given below the main contribution to the final density profile of the halo comes from @xmath25 of the order of few . although hs used the large @xmath25 approximation as the one applicable at large distances from the peak , it is possible to interpret large @xmath25 also as small smoothing scales .",
    "the smoothing procedure of the initial density field that is performed here in order to determine the location of the overdense regions has no equivalent in real structure formation or @xmath0-body simulations where the only artificial scales are those of softening length and the size of the simulation box .",
    "one may argue that the large distance ( or small smoothing scale ) approximation to @xmath50 is therefore more realistic .",
    "however , taking into account the intrinsic role of the initial smoothing in determination of the initial conditions for collapse , the masses of halos etc .",
    "it is difficult to accept such argument .",
    "another limitation of the model presented in section  2 comes from the statistical approach to determining the initial conditions for collapse .",
    "the density profile is evaluated with the assumption @xmath51 , while this approximation can only be considered valid for scales up to the scale of coherence @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 the calculation of the dispersion @xmath54 in the case of power - law spectra and gaussian smoothing is presented in appendix  a. equation ( [ p31 ] ) can be then solved numerically for @xmath52 .",
    "the results for different spectral indices @xmath55 and heights of the peak @xmath21 are shown in figure  [ ccohcpp ] .",

    "nfw claim that their fitting formula is valid in the range @xmath59 .",
    "i therefore fit the formula ( [ p25 ] ) to the points ( @xmath60 ) obtained from equations ( [ p36])-([p37 ] ) , spaced uniformly in log @xmath61 in this range . for a given spectral index @xmath55",
    "the single fitting parameter is the concentration @xmath62 .",
    "nfw consider density profiles of halos of mass roughly in the range @xmath63 so the initial redshifts will be chosen here so as to obtain similar range of masses .",
    "examples of profiles for halos of different mass are shown in figures  [ s ] and [ b ] .",
    "figure  [ s ] shows the density profiles for objects of mass of the order of @xmath64 , which corresponds to a big galaxy mass scale , while figure  [ b ] shows the profiles for halos of mass of the order of @xmath65 , which is closer to the mass of a galaxy cluster .",
    "such choice of the mass values is motivated by the range of masses obtained for different spectral indices ( see figure  [ kon ] and the following discussion ) .",
    "the initial redshifts needed to obtain halos of those masses and all the following parameters are given in tables  [ small ] and [ big ] for the small and large masses respectively .    in agreement with the above discussion of the dependence of mass on the smoothing scale , smaller masses require smaller smoothing scales and the condition @xmath66 translates into their larger initial redshifts @xmath67 .",
    "in the case of small masses the initial virial radii @xmath68 are of the order of the cut - off scale @xmath69 which means that the cut - off really influences the formation of small halos , i.e. in the absence of the cut - off their virial radii would be much larger . in the case of the large mass halos the situation is different : their virial radii @xmath68 are significantly smaller than the cut - off scale : this scale could not be reached by the present epoch .",
    "the proper virial radii @xmath70 are few times larger for larger masses and in both cases agree well with the observational estimates of the sizes of the halos of galaxies and clusters .",
    "the last two columns of tables  [ small ] and [ big ] give the concentrations @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the nfw formula .",
    "the values of @xmath71 were calculated from the model based on merging formalism provided by nfw that describes best the results of their @xmath0-body simulations , while @xmath72 are the values of concentration obtained by fitting formula ( [ p25 ] ) to the results of sim .",
    "following the arguments presented above the fits were done for the value of @xmath73 calculated from the sim .",
    "the width of the filter @xmath74 was chosen so that the concentrations from nfw and sim match for the smallest halos in the @xmath75 case .",
    "figure  [ kon ] shows how the concentration @xmath62 depends on the mass of the halo and the spectral index in the larger range of masses .",
    "the plots cover the largest range of mass available from sim for different spectral indices with the initial conditions i adopted .",
    "the smallest masses were obtained for @xmath76 and the largest correspond to the point where the mass starts to decrease with @xmath67 ( the initial virial radii are then rather small , significantly smaller than the cut - off scale ) .",
    "the values of concentrations from the simulations were calculated in the same range of mass as the one obtained from sim .",
    "the solid lines give the concentrations obtained from fitting sim results and the dashed lines are the @xmath0-body results of nfw ( one has to remember that those curves are fits to points displaying some scatter that were themselves obtained by fitting the concentrations to the highly irregular density profiles of halos in the simulations ) . in each set",
    "the curves from top to bottom correspond to @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the results for higher spectral indices are shown in the smaller range of mass because obtaining halos of smaller mass for example in the case of @xmath79 would require initial redshift of @xmath80 i.e. initial time earlier than the recombination epoch .",
    "similar behaviour  more massive and more slowly forming halos for larger spectral indices  is observed in the @xmath0-body simulations of nfw .",
    "the two vertical dotted lines in the left panel indicate the mass scales chosen for detailed comparison shown in figures  [ s]-[b ] and tables  [ small]-[big ] .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ kon ] shows the sim results for the constant width of the cut - off filter @xmath81 which matches the concentrations for smallest masses in the case of @xmath75 .",
    "there is however no reason why the same width of filter should apply for different spectral indices so we can try to adopt different widths for different spectral indices .",
    "results of matching the sim and nfw concentrations for the smallest masses in all cases are shown in the right panel of figure  [ kon ] .",
    "the adopted widths were @xmath82 respectively for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "although we have no way of estimating the exact shape of the cut - off function from theory , one can expect that the cut - off will be sharper for peaks with sharper initial density distribution i.e. for higher spectral indices .",
    "this guess is in agreement with the dependence of the best matching values of @xmath74 on the spectral index .",
    "the predictive power of the improved sim suffers also from the fact that the discrepancy between the sim and nfw concentrations is much more sensitive to the unknown parameter @xmath74 than to the cut - off scale , which we have estimated from the peaks formalism .",
    "calculations of the profiles with different cut - off scales show that e.g. decreasing the cut - off scale gives smaller mass and steeper profile but because the mass is strongly affected the corresponding concentration from the simulations is also decreased and the factor by which both concentrations differ remains roughly the same . on the other hand , decreasing the width of the cut - off filter does not significantly affect the mass while the concentration of sim profiles is increased .    leaving aside the exact determination of the width of the filter",
    ", figure  [ kon ] proves that sim predicts the same general trend in the dependence of the shape of dark halo profiles on their mass : the smaller the halo mass the steeper the profile .",
    "the dependence of the shape of the halo on the initial power spectrum is also reproduced in the wide range of masses : concentrations are larger for higher spectral indices up to a mass of the order of the nonlinear mass @xmath83 where sim approximation seems to break down .",
    "we can also conclude from figure  [ kon ] that the agreement between sim and the simulations is better for lower spectral indices .",
    "one may interpret this result as an indication that for spectra with more large scale power and long - distance correlations ( low @xmath55 ) accretion is a realistic mechanism of growth of fluctuations . on the other hand , in the case of higher spectral indices",
    "isolated halos tend to appear and even relatively small halos form by merging of yet smaller objects .",
    "another argument for the reliability of sim comes from the possible ( and rather straighforward ) application of the results presented here to more realistic scale - dependent power spectra .",
    "since smaller masses correspond to smaller smoothing scales where the effective spectral index of a realistic spectrum is lower , the dependence of the concentration on mass according to the sim should be flatter .",
    "this effect is also well visible in the simulations of nfw : for the cdm spectrum the trend of smaller concentrations with growing mass is preserved but the dependence on mass is rather weak ( especially when we take into account large scatter in the results ) .",
    "the improved sim presented in this paper provides simple understanding of the dependence of the shape of the halo on its mass : smaller halos start forming earlier and by the present epoch their virial radii reach the cut - off scale that accounts for the presence of the neighbouring fluctuations ; more massive halos form later and their virial radii are not affected by the cut - off scale , their virialized regions contain only the material that initially was quite close to the peak identified with the smoothing scale corresponding to the mass .",
    "although the concentrations of profiles predicted by sim depend on the exact shape of the cut - off function , this study leads to rather firm conclusion that the agreement between the @xmath0-body and sim profiles is the better the smaller the mass of the halo and the lower the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "if the profiles obtained from the simulations indeed reflect reality this may indicate that galactic halos form mostly by accretion , while for cluster size objects merging must be taken into account . as suggested by syer & white ( 1998 )",
    "the universal profile can be formed by sufficiently dense satellites reaching the centre of a halo intact and forming a cusp .",
    "since the attempts to obtain the dependence of the profiles on mass only from formalisms describing the merging of halos ( nusser & sheth 1999 , avila - reese , firmani & hernandez 1998 ) have not been fully successful , it seems that the best description of halo profiles should be provided by a model dealing with a combination of accretion and merging ( for the discussion on the distinction between the two phenomena see salvador - sol , solanes & manrique 1998 ) .",
    "this work provides the understanding of the origin of universal profile in the case of small masses for which sim can be considered a valid approximation .",
    "one of the important shortcomings of sim , that was not mentioned here , is the artificial combination of the linear and strongly nonlinear regime without taking into account the weakly nonlinear phase that may affect the initial density distribution before the strongly nonlinear evolution takes over . as discussed by okas ( 1998 )",
    "these corrections are of similar importance as the ones introduced by using the formalism of bbks to describe peaks in the density field instead of overdense regions .",
    "both effects tend to steepen the initial density profiles but are difficult to model analytically ( for the corrections for peaks see e.g. ryden 1988 ) . with the modifications of sim introduced here we are interested mostly in regions not very distant from the centre of the forming halo . in these regions",
    "weakly nonlinear corrections to the expected overdensity @xmath84 are known only numerically and it is difficult to obtain the cumulative density @xmath85 . even if we approximate it by some analytical expression we can not proceed because the formula for the final profile is so complicated that any perturbative treatment is impossible .",
    "qualitatively one may expect that the final profile will be somewhat steeper but since the value of @xmath86 will not be changed the solution for the virial radius @xmath87 will be lower .",
    "it follows that also the halo mass will be decreased but it will have to be compared to a less massive and therefore steeper halo from the simulations , so it is difficult to predict whether the agreement between the two results would be improved .",
    "it should be added that this picture of weakly nonlinear corrections does not take into account the parallel evolution of the rms fluctuation @xmath17 itself . as discussed by okas et al .",
    "( 1996 ) its value in the weakly nonlinear regime may be close to linear in the case of @xmath75 but may differ significantly from the linear prediction for other spectral indices .",
    "no solution to the problem of dark halo formation can not be considered valid without a detailed agreement between its predictions and observations .",
    "to date several such comparisons were performed , in most cases in the form of fitting the nfw profile to the observed profiles of galaxies and clusters that are believed to be dominated by dark matter or provide some indication on how light traces mass .",
    "carlberg et al . ( 1997 ) find that universal profile of nfw provides a very good fit to the density profiles of clusters in the cnoc survey , while adami et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that galaxy distribution in clusters in the enacs sample displays a core rather than a cusp in the central regions , but the mass distribution ( adami , private communication ) is somewhat steeper .",
    "these results suggest that the universal profile indeed provides a good description of the density distribution in clusters . in the case of galaxies",
    "the situation is less satisfying .",
    "kravtsov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) analysed density profiles of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies and found that they are much better fitted by a so - called burkert profile ( burkert 1995 ) with a flatter cusp than in the nfw formula .",
    "they also performed a series of @xmath0-body simulations based on a different code than that used by nfw and found similar shapes of galaxies as those observed .",
