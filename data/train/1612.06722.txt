    "classical cepheids , also known as @xmath1 cep - type stars or just cepheids , are population i instability strip pulsators crucial for understanding stellar structure and evolution .",
    "most galactic cepheids pulsate in one mode with remarkably stable amplitudes and periods , although space - based photometry reveals that they are not entirely regular clocks .",
    "observations with _",
    "corot , kepler _ and _ most _ detect short - term , low - amplitude irregular variability or `` jitter '' in the pulsation cycles of some classical cepheids @xcite .",
    "one exception is v473 lyrae ( @xmath2  = 19@xmath315@xmath45949 , @xmath5 = + 2755346 , @xmath6 = 6.18 mag ) , the only known classical cepheid in the galaxy that undergoes strong amplitude and phase modulations .",
    "the changes in the pulsation amplitude were first noted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the modulation period to be 3.33.4 years , which was later measured to be 1210 d by @xcite , and 1258 d by @xcite , respectively .",
    "the origin of this modulation was extensively discussed in the literature , with theories ranging from mode beating @xcite to magneto - convective cycles @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of extensive ground - based observations collected during 19662011 @xcite confirmed that v473 lyrae pulsates in the second overtone , modulated with a primary period of @xmath7 d. @xcite also discovered a second , longer modulation cycle with a period of @xmath8 d , and concluded that the modulation closely resembles the blazhko effect seen in rr lyrae stars .",
    "v473 lyrae is unique among galactic cepheids : the closest counterparts are v1154 cyg , in which the _ kepler _ space telescope detected modulation but with a very low amplitude @xcite and sv vul , with a suspected , much longer modulation period of order 30 yr @xcite . beyond our galaxy ,",
    "strong amplitude modulation was recently found in three classical cepheids in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "although modulation appears to be very rare among cepheids , the phenomenological properties of the light variations of v473 lyr closely resemble the blazhko effect , a common feature among rr lyrae stars .",
    "thanks to space - based photometry , we now know that many modulated rr lyrae stars show low - amplitude additional modes and/or alternating high- and low - amplitude cycles known as period doubling @xcite .",
    "numerical models suggest that mode resonances that generate the period doubling can also be responsible for the modulation itself @xcite .",
    "it is not unreasonable , therefore , to postulate that similar mechanisms could operate in modulated cepheids too .",
    "unfortunately , the pulsation period of v473 lyr ,",
    "@xmath9  =  1.4909d , means that one can not observe consecutive pulsation maxima from a single ground - based site .",
    "this makes it virtually impossible to detect period doubling , a challenge also faced in ground - based rr lyrae observations .",
    "therefore , we proposed to gather continuous observations of the star with the _ most _ space telescope for a timespan of one month in order to search for cycle - to - cycle variations .",
    "_ most _ serendipitously also observed another cepheid , u tra , just before the run that targeted v473 lyr . a campaign aimed at the wolf - rayet star wr 71 included this beat cepheid within the same field of view .",
    "u tra ( @xmath2 = 16@xmath307@xmath41901 , @xmath5 = 6254380 , @xmath6 = 7.89 mag ) , along with tu cas were the first cepheids in which beating ( the characteristic feature caused by double - mode pulsation ) was observed @xcite .",
    "u tra pulsates in the fundamental mode and the first overtone , with periods @xmath10d and @xmath11d @xcite . after an investigation of the relative amplitudes of the pulsation",
    "modes over time , @xcite proposed that pulsation energy may have been redistributed from the fundamental mode to the first overtone , an intriguing concept that can be tested with new measurements . together with earlier observations of rt aur and sz tau @xcite ,",
    "_ most _ s cepheid sample now totals 4 stars .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section [ sec2 ] describes the various observations we carried out ; sections [ secv473 ] and [ secutra ] include the analysis and obtained results for v473 lyr and u tra , respectively ; section [ secsum ] closes with discussion and summary of the findings presented in the paper .",
    "the stars were observed by the _ most _ ( microvariability & oscillations of stars ) space telescope : a canadian microsatellite designed to observe bright stellar targets continuously for up to 2 months at a time @xcite .",
    "we also obtained spectroscopy for both stars with various ground - based instruments .        in the case of u tra , in the field of the _",
    "most _ primary science target wr 71 , each orbit was shared with another primary science field .",
    "u tra was observed for 28 days during 29 may  25 june 2014 .",
    "as _ most _ has to use the science ccd for guiding purposes too , it takes short individual exposures that are stacked on - board to boost the stellar signals .",
    "the sampling cadence is 123.8 sec .    in the case of v473 lyrae ,",
    "the star is located in the sky where _ most _ must point at too large an angle relative to the sun , heating the satellite beyond the thermal limits for its battery .",
    "but the v473 lyrae run coincided with the  eclipse season \" for _ most _ , when the sun skims briefly below the earth horizon once per orbit for a few minutes .",
    "it was possible to point _ most _ at v473 lyrae for a few minutes per orbit , leading to an effective sampling cadence of 101 minutes .",
    "each orbit contains 210 measurements , with a cadence of 62.2 sec .",
    "the star was observed for 27 days during 28 june ",
    "23 july 2014 , but communication problems with the satellite and deliberate interruptions to observe other targets introduced some longer gaps .",
    "we have data from 57 per cent of the _ most _ orbits in the overall run .",
    "most photometric reduction processes are well established ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have recently been successfully applied to other cepheids @xcite .",
    "_ most _ data experience modulation of scattered earthshine with the 101-min orbital period .",
    "also , as the instrument regains thermal equilibrium after switching from two widely - separated points in the sky , there are short - lived trends after switching from one field to another .",
    "stray light modulation is filtered in the reduction process ; extreme outliers were removed by sigma - clipping the flux values . in instances of substantially poor pointing , data were filtered by sigma - clipping outliers in the pointing positions and the measured flux values .    to preserve the intrinsic cepheid variations ,",
    "slow trends were filtered from the data and clipping applied to the residuals .",
    "the filtered data were phased with the orbital period and averaged in bins to remove modulations caused by stray light .",
    "we note that v473 lyr is much less affected by stray light than u tra as it was only observed when _ most _ was in the shadow of the earth .",
    "finally , the large - amplitude variation was restored to the data .",
    "any remaining slow trends were then subtracted by a simple linear fit .",
    "the final light curves ( times , magnitudes and errors ) are shown in fig .",
