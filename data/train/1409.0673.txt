    "it is at the core of physical sciences to describe and investigate the dynamics of physical systems .",
    "depending on their nature , these can either be described by the schrdinger equation in case of quantum mechanical systems , or e.g.  in terms of hamiltonian mechanics in case of a classical system . in both cases ,",
    "a canonical structure of the dynamical equations is inherent which is expressed in the existence of conjugate pairs of field operators @xmath0 with infinite degrees of freedom or conjugate coordinates @xmath1 with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "both approaches serve as powerful frameworks to investigate a huge amount of different physical problems .",
    "in addition to the global dynamics of a physical system which can be determined by solving the corresponding equations of motion , its fixed points play a crucial role in many investigations : for example , fixed points which correspond to a ( local ) minimum of the hamiltonian form ( metastable ) ground states of the system . moreover , fixed points which are related to saddle points of the hamiltonian are unstable , excited states . a special class of such unstable fixed points",
    "are rank-1 saddle points which possess exactly one unstable direction .",
    "these points are of special interest in dynamical systems , because they form bottlenecks in the underlying phase space which separate different regions therein . considering a dynamical system , the transition from one to the other subregion of phase space",
    "is then mediated by the saddle point .",
    "therefore , the latter determines the reaction dynamics between the different subregions which is the basic statement of transition state theory ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    beyond the fixed points of the system s dynamical equations themselves ,",
    "their local properties are of high interest in many applications .",
    "for example , the local properties of a minimum of the hamiltonian determine the physics of the system for small excitations from the ground state . moreover ,",
    "the local properties in the vicinity of a rank-1 saddle point or transition state determine the reaction dynamics and rates of the system .",
    "for a detailed analysis of the local fixed point properties of a canonical hamiltonian system as well as for the construction of a dividing surface that separates reactants and products in it , a standard and powerful tool is its normal form expansion @xcite .",
    "if the hamiltonian @xmath2 is given in terms of a set of canonical coordinates @xmath3 then the normal form of this hamiltonian is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an appropriate generating function and @xmath6 is the adjoint operator that equals the definition of the poisson bracket ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . by construction",
    ", the normal form provides the most simple form of the original hamilton function , while keeping all the essential properties of the dynamics .    in this paper , we focus on the local fixed point properties of the more general case of _ noncanonical _ hamiltonian systems . in these the dynamical equations",
    "are hamiltonian ( see below for a precise definition ) , however , the underlying coordinates are not canonical . in such systems , fixed points and their local properties",
    "have the same physical meaning and importance as in the canonical case and for a detailed analysis of the local properties , it is desirable to obtain an analogue of the classical normal form also for the noncanonical system .",
    "however , the usual treatment can not be applied , because neither a classical hamilton function in canonical coordinates nor such coordinates themselves are known . in this paper",
    ", we present a method by which both the transformation of a noncanonical hamiltonian system into its normal form and simultaneously the construction of canonical coordinates is obtained .",
    "the result of the transformations is , by construction , a set of canonical normal form coordinates . in the latter ,",
    "the energy functional of the system will serve as a classical hamilton function which has the advantageous property that it is directly formulated in action variables .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : noncan - ham - sys ] , we introduce the general form of a noncanonical hamiltonian system which is taken into account in this paper",
    ". moreover , we discuss as a fixed point property of the linearised dynamical equations the latters general eigenvalue structure that will directly determine the normal form structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : construction ] , the method to construct local canonical coordinates in the vicinity of the fixed point is introduced . therefore ,",
    "a symplectic basis formed by appropriately normalized eigenvectors of the linearised dynamical equations is used and higher - order terms of the expansions are treated via normal form transformations . as a key feature  and in contrast to the usual normal form expansion of canonical hamiltonians  this procedure treats the dynamical equations and the energy functional separately .",
    "moreover , the normal form expansions are carried out in two steps : first , its polynomial structure is generated using the nonresonant terms of the corresponding generating function ( see below for the latters definition ) .",
    "second , the remaining resonant coefficients of the generating function which are free parameters are chosen in such a way that the dynamical equations as well as the energy functional in normal form coordinates fulfil canonical equations , i.e.  the normal form coordinates are canonical ones by construction . finally , we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : tdvp ] a variational approach to quantum systems which defines a noncanonical hamiltonian system for the variational parameters .",
    "let us consider a hamiltonian system with @xmath7 degrees of freedom",
    ". in standard canonical coordinates @xmath8 , the physics of this system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 which is a real function of the coordinates .",
    "the dynamics of the system is then determined by hamilton s equations @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is the standard symplectic matrix @xmath12 the latter relates the hamiltonian vector field @xmath13 to the derivative @xmath14 of the hamiltonian , and it induces a symplectic geometry on phase space . as we have already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "such a canonical structure is also present in quantum mechanical schrdinger systems , where the field operators @xmath0 play an analogous role to the conjugate coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "however , this canonical structure is e.g.  lost in case of a variational approach to quantum systems ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : tdvp ] ) .",
    "therefore , we focus on the more general case of _ noncanonical _ hamiltonian systems in this paper .",
    "independent of the coordinates which are made use of , the latter can be defined in terms of differential geometry by the fact that the corresponding hamiltonian vector field @xmath15 is connected via an alternating , nondegenerate , and closed 2-form @xmath16 to the differential of a smooth function @xmath2 on phase space @xcite , i.e.@xmath17 comparing this general definition with the standard canonical case discussed in eq .  , the matrix @xmath11 in eq",

    "note , that eq .",
    "is formally equivalent to eq .",
    ", in the sense that the time derivative of the coordinates is related via a skew - symmetric matrix to the derivative of a real function which represents the energy of the system .",
    "what makes the system noncanonical is the fact that the matrix @xmath21 is not equal to the standard symplectic matrix @xmath11 defined in eq .  , but it may have a more complicated structure .",
    "especially , @xmath21 is allowed to depend on the coordinates , i.e.  the symplectic geometry may vary with position on the space of noncanonical coordinates @xmath25 . with these properties ,",
    "the time - derivatives @xmath26 of all coordinates ( @xmath27 ; @xmath28 ) are , in general , coupled in a nontrivial way , and  in contrast to the canonical case ",
    "there do not exist preferential _",
    "pairs _ of conjugate coordinates .    in order to investigate the geometric properties of the noncanonical coordinate space , we note that the matrix @xmath21 naturally defines a differential 2-form @xmath29",
    "this 2-form is alternating by definition of the wedge product which takes into account the skew - symmetry of @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , the 2-form is nondegenerate ( i.e.   for every @xmath30 there exists a @xmath31 such that @xmath32 ) if @xmath21 is invertible .",
    "this is a natural assumption , because otherwise , the dynamical equations can not be solved for @xmath33 uniquely .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath34 is closed , i.e.  its exterior derivative vanishes , @xmath35 whether or not the latter property is fulfilled will , in general , depend on the precise form of the matrix @xmath21",

    "these are determined by the linearised dynamical equations @xmath51 where it is assumed that the fixed point is located at the origin @xmath52 for simplicity ( this can always be achieved by a simple shift of the coordinates ) .",
    "@xmath53 is the zeroth - order expansion of the matrix @xmath41 and @xmath54 is the linearised vector @xmath24 at the fixed point .",
    "because @xmath41 is skew - symmetric in general , this property of course also holds for its zeroth - order approximation .",
    "the matrix @xmath55 is symmetric , because it is the negative hessian matrix of the energy functional according to eq .   ,",
    "consequently , the equations @xmath57 hold . in order to obtain the eigenvalue spectrum of the linearised equations of motion",
    ", the first - order differential equation is solved using the ansatz @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a complex parameter , and @xmath60 is a complex vector . inserting this ansatz into eq .",

    "thus , if @xmath62 is a root of the characteristic polynomial , then also @xmath65 is a root , so that all the eigenvalues occur pairwise with different sign",
    ". therefore , the eigenvalue spectrum of the linearised dynamical equations in the vicinity of a fixed point always exhibits the structure @xmath66 which will be of fundamental importance for the normal form expansions performed in the next sec .",
    "[ sec : construction ] .",
    "the knowledge of canonical coordinates is fundamental to many methods known from classical hamiltonian mechanics and , beyond their existence , a central question is how these can be constructed .",
    "as the key result of this paper , a general method to construct canonical normal form coordinates will be presented in this section . as will be shown , this method has the advantage that it simultaneously yields both a procedure to extract canonical coordinates and a transformation of the system into its poincar - birkhoff normal form .",
    "the procedure consists of the following three steps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nf - principle ] ) :     and the arrows depict the vector field @xmath67 obtained by the dynamical equations . in the vicinity of a fixed point ( red circle ) , the normal form coordinates define a local coordinate system whose origin is the fixed point . ]",
    "a.   in the first step , the expansions as well as that of the energy functional @xmath23 are transformed via a linear change of coordinates to a symplectic basis which is defined by the eigenvectors of the linearised dynamical equations .",
    "the resulting diagonal coordinates are canonical ones in the first order of the expansions",
    ". b.   successive lie transforms are applied order by order to treat the higher - order corrections of the expansions . in the corresponding generating function",
    "two different types of terms will be distinguished , namely `` nonresonant '' and `` resonant '' coefficients ( see below ) .",
    "the generation of the normal form structure will be performed via the nonresonant terms , and all of them are determined uniquely by the requirement that certain monomials of the dynamical equations shall be removed . which of the terms remain after the lie transforms is solely determined by a resonance condition depending on the eigenvalues , and because of their general structure",
    ", the normal form will exhibit a fundamental polynomial structure . c.   the normal form expansions leave the freedom to choose the resonant terms of the generating function . in the last step ,",
    "these free parameters are chosen in a way that the dynamical equations and the energy functional fulfil canonical equations , i.e.  the normal form coordinates are canonical ones by construction .",
    "[ sec : nf - step1 ]    in order to `` simplify '' the system in its lowest order , it is sufficient to focus on the linearised dynamical equations .",

    "omitting the prime , this linear change of coordinates transforms the dynamical equations into the form @xmath75 in the last step , the single expansion coefficients have been redefined by the coefficients @xmath76 which collect the terms homogeneous of degree @xmath46 . it is noted that , because the inverse matrix @xmath77 is used here instead of the transpose @xmath78 , the linear term of eq .",
    "is diagonal by construction , @xmath79note that the originally real vector field is , in general , transformed into a complex one ( @xmath80 ) by the diagonalisation , if the eigenvalue spectrum includes imaginary terms .",
    "analogously to the dynamical equations , also the energy functional is expanded in the vicinity of the fixed point , and the linear transformation @xmath81 is applied .",
    "this results in the scalar field @xmath82 whose coefficients , again , become complex in general , and whose second - order term has the structure @xmath83 .",
    "the diagonalisation of the local dynamical equations as described in the previous section [ sec : nf - step1 ] , simplifies their linear part in a way that it becomes diagonal .",
    "however , for the terms of higher order , a `` simplification '' can not be achieved by this step . for this purpose , a normal form expansion of the diagonalized dynamical equations",
    "is performed in this section making use of successive lie transforms .",

    "therefore , it is convenient to also define the generating function as a multivariate polynomial , so that the transformed fields will also be such ones . in the following ,",
    "these polynomials are written as    @xmath103    [ eq : nf - multivariate - expansion ]    where @xmath104 denote the terms of the respective series which are homogeneous of degree @xmath46 , and @xmath105 are the coefficients of the expansion .",
