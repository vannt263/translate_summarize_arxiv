    "our analysis of the singularities in the phase - space of ssso in mdg yields new physical consequences .",

    "a basic example is neutron stars in mdg @xcite .",
    "our consideration is much more general and can be applied to any single ssso in the universe with metric @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the luminosity radius ..    the odes for the structure of mdg - ssso and the corresponding boundary conditions at the center , at the edge of the ssso , and at the boundary of the mdg universe were derived in @xcite and used in @xcite for neutron stars with different matter equation of state .",

    "here we use the zhukovsky function @xmath23 in the open interval @xmath24 . to some extent , in the problems under consideration the potentials play the role of the familiar harmonic oscillator potentials in mechanics . in cosmological units :",

    "it depends on only one parameter @xmath54 in the case of potentials , when one uses cosmological units .",
    "a specific peculiarity of our problem is that its singular points are not isolated and form singular sub - manifolds @xmath55 of different dimensions @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , to be able to consider the changes of structure of the phase - space flow of ssso in mdg , we are forced to develop the very theory of bifurcations . in the present article , we make some first steps toward the solution of this problem .",
    "the equilibria , dubbed also singular points of eqs . in the phase space @xmath57 , are zeros of the system @xmath58 .",
