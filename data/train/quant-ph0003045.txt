    "<S> an elementary treatment of the dirac equation in the presence of a three - dimensional spherically symmetric @xmath0-potential is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to handle the matching conditions in the configuration space , and discuss the occurrence of supercritical effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem of solving the dirac equation in the presence of a @xmath1 potential represents a curious and non simple situation , in contrast with the equivalent problem in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , i.e. , the schrdinger equation , which is discussed in any course on quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this is basically related to the fact that being the dirac equation of first order , a singular potential , like the @xmath1 one , induces discontinuities at the level of the wave function themselves instead of the usual discontinuities that appear in the first derivative in the schrdinger scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> this puzzling situation has been discussed previously in the literature by many authors . </S>",
    "<S> rigorous construction of self adjoint extensions for the dirac operator , allowing the handling of matching conditions at the support of the @xmath1 potential were discussed in @xcite . using their results , in @xcite a discussion of this problem </S>",
    "<S> was presented . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have realized that the proposed solution corresponds to a different self adjoint extension , associated to also a different singular potential .    at present , a simple and elementary discussion , without the necessity of invoking sophisticated mathematical constructions , is still not available in the literature . in this note </S>",
    "<S> we want to overcome this situation , showing in elementary terms how to handle the problem in the configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> other authors have shown how to handle the problem in momentum space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using our results , we discuss the occurrence of supercritical effects , i.e. , the possibility that the ground state starts to dive into the depths of the dirac sea , implying positron emission @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dirac equation with an external potential can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the usual @xmath6 dirac matrices and @xmath7 is the four - component dirac spinor .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the attractive spherically symmetric ( vector ) potential given by    @xmath8    with @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to recall some general properties of the solution of the dirac equation in a central potential . for more details </S>",
    "<S> the reader may consult the book by greiner , mller , and rafelski @xcite and reference therein . in this case , the complete set of commuting operators is given by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total angular momentum ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 is defined by    @xmath17    in this expression @xmath18 where the @xmath19 s are the pauli matrices . in terms of @xmath20 , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand @xmath22 is the orbital angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath13 are given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the four - component spinor solution of the dirac equation written in terms of the two - component upper and lower @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> in the equation , @xmath27 are the usual eigenvalues of @xmath11 according to : @xmath28    we note that the four - component dirac spinor is not an eigenfunction of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however the upper and lower components , taken separately , satisfy @xmath30\\psi_u(x ) \\equiv l_u(l_u+1)\\hbar^2 \\psi_u(x),\\\\\\ ] ] and @xmath31\\psi_l(x ) \\equiv </S>",
    "<S> l_l(l_l+1)\\hbar^2 \\psi_l(x).\\ ] ] note that the orbital parities of the upper and lower components have opposite signs . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to parametrise the four - component spinor by separating the radial and angular dependence according to    @xmath32 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } g(r ) \\omega_{j l_u m}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\                          i f(r ) \\omega_{j l_l m}(\\theta,\\phi)\\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 are the spherical spinors that carry out the angular part . </S>",
    "<S> here we have coupled , through appropriate clebsh - gordan coefficients , the scalar spherical harmonics @xmath34 with the eigenfunctions of the spin given by the two - components spinors @xmath35 .    for the present discussion we do not need the explicit form of the angular part . if we now consider the dirac equation for a spinor parametrised in this way , it is not difficult to show that the radial components satisfy the following set of coupled differential equations : @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . because of the linear discontinuity of the spinor function , given by the delta potential , we need to fix the boundary conditions in the neighbourhood of the shell @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> if we multiply equation by @xmath41 , equation by @xmath42 , and then , sum both expressions to remove the singular delta function , we obtain : @xmath43    in the previous expression , the primes denote radial derivatives . by integrating between @xmath44 and @xmath45 and taken then the limit when @xmath46 we get :    @xmath47    assuming that the discontinuities of these functions are well behaved we find that :    @xmath48    we may consider @xmath41 and @xmath42 as the real and imaginary parts of a function in @xmath49 . in this context , equation expresses the fact that the absolute value of this function is constant when crossing the support of the @xmath50-potential . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the condition established by j. dittrich , p. exner , and p. seba ( see equation ( 3.5a ) in @xcite ; see also the remarks after equation ( 21 ) in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the absolute value of this function is continuous for all @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> if we set @xmath52 and @xmath53 , becomes    @xmath54    now , as a second step , we multiply the differential equations by @xmath42 and @xmath41 , respectively , and substract them to get @xmath55    dividing by @xmath56 which is continuous for all values of @xmath51 , we can integrate in the neighbourhood of the shell radius    @xmath57    by using @xmath58 and since @xmath59}=\\arctan ( h(x))$ ] we have :    @xmath60    in this way , our second boundary condition can be written as    @xmath61    expressing the coupling constant in units of @xmath62 , we define the dimensionless parameter @xmath63 . our second boundary condition can then be expressed as    @xmath64    except for an arbitrary phase , the last expression can be written as a matricial relation between the radial functions at both sides of the potential ,    @xmath65 = \\left [   \\begin{array}{cc } \\cos ( a/\\hbar c )   & -\\sin ( a/\\hbar c ) \\\\   </S>",

    "<S> g_{- } \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    this matrix @xmath66 is unitary ( actually orthogonal ) , @xmath67 , and contains the information for finding the eigenvalue equation for the bound states . returning to our complex valued function with real and imaginary part given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to remark that the @xmath1 manifests itself through a change of phase of this function , given by @xmath68 .    for the solutions of equations and corresponding to the free case </S>",
    "<S> , we may separate the space into two regions :    region i , @xmath69 ,    @xmath70    region ii , @xmath71 , @xmath72 the relations we are looking for reduce to    @xmath73    taking into account that for the ground state , for @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 we can write    @xmath77    in these equations @xmath78 denotes a wave number , @xmath79 . in order to find the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate and of @xmath80 and use the boundary condition . in this way we are led to solving the following transcendental equation    @xmath81    without solving explicitly this equation , we can analyse the behaviour of the ground state energy @xmath82 , as a function of the parameter @xmath83 , related to the coupling constant @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> we start by introducing the following dimensionless variables @xmath85 in terms of these variables , our eigenvalue equation can be written as    @xmath86    for a fixed value of the radius of the @xmath50 -shell , @xmath80 ( with @xmath87 ) , we are interested in determining the existence of the ground state energy in the interval @xmath88 ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) </S>",
    "<S> . the existence of an @xmath90 in this range will depend on the values of the coupling constant @xmath84 through the dimensionless parameter @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath92 , we get from that @xmath93 on the other hand , using we get @xmath94    using the limits and in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> we see that as @xmath82 approaches the free state ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 , which agrees with the fact that the bound states disappears for a vanishing potential .    </S>",
    "<S> proceeding as before , with @xmath97 ( i.e. , as the energy approaches the dirac sea ) , we infer from equation that @xmath91 approaches the value @xmath98 , which gives @xmath99 where @xmath100 , the minimum positive solution of , is the value of the coupling constant for which the ground state energy sinks into the dirac sea ( e.g. , for @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) .    the numerical solution of equation for the dimensionless ground state energy @xmath90 as a function of @xmath103 and @xmath84 is plotted in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that for a fixed value of @xmath103 , @xmath90 is a decreasing function of @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> . for all finite values of @xmath103 there are supercritical effects . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the value of @xmath100 for which @xmath90 sinks into the dirac sea , is increasing with @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the limit @xmath104 is not well defined in and thus we can not find solutions for bound sates in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to remark that a general theorem by svendsen , @xcite , tells us that supercritical effects are absent in this limit . </S>"
