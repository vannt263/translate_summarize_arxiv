    "in this paper i show how to formulate an asymptotically free theory in such a way that it includes perturbative and non - perturbative phenomena simultaneously .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "contrary to an infrared free theory , in an asymptotically free theory the divergences prevent us from writing even perturbation expansions in a unique , well - defined way .",
    "we can , however , make use of the fact that divergences in the theory enter only the green s functions and the vertices . on the other hand , knowing the green s functions and the vertices we can express all the other amplitudes through them perturbatively in a unique way .",
    "thus , we have to formulate equations for green s functions and vertices in a form which does not contain any divergences .",
    "if this is done , the solutions of these equations will contain both perturbative and non - perturbative phenomena .    to avoid technical complications , in the first section of the paper we will derive these equations in an abelian theory",
    "in which usual perturbation theory is also well defined . in the second section",
    "we generalize the equations for a non - abelian theory and discuss the connection between perturbative and non - perturbative effects .",
    "the equations have an integro - differential structure in which the asymptotic behaviour of the green s functions is defined by the boundary conditions .",
    "the main conclusion in this section is that in the region of large momenta the green s functions of quarks and gluons contain additional parameters compared to normal perturbation theory which can be associated with different types of `` condensates '' .",
    "these non - perturbative parameters can be defined by solving the equations and finding non - singular solutions in the infrared region . a priori it is not clear what type of additional conditions have to be imposed on this system of equations in order to fix a non - singular solution .",
    "it can be , for example , the conservation of the axial current or of other currents which is formally satisfied from the point of view of the lagrangian but is not ensured because of the divergences .    in the third section",
    "we will show that these equations make it possible , for the first time , to analyse the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking in an asymptotically free theory and to find approximately the value of the critical coupling at which symmetry breaking occures .",
    "also , they allow us to answer the fundamental question for asymptotically free theories , namely : how the bound states  the hadrons  have to be treated in these theories and how these bound states influence the equations for the green s functions .",
    "the analysis leads to the following conclusion .",
    "the conditions for axial current conservation of flavour non - singlet currents ( in the limit of zero bare quark masses ) require that eight goldstone bosons ( the pseudo - scalar octet ) have to be regarded as elementary objects with couplings defined by ward identities .",
    "this is so in spite of the fact that the couplings of these states to fermions decrease at large fermion virtualities .",
    "the same analysis provides a new possibility for the solution of the @xmath0 problem . in this solution",
    "the flavour singlet pseudoscalar @xmath1 is a normal bound state of @xmath2 without a point - like structure .",
    "the mass of this bound state is different from zero and can be calculated in the limit of massless quarks . for massive quarks",
    "the pseudoscalar octet becomes massive .",
    "their masses , however , are not calculable in terms of bare quark masses because of logarithmic divergences and have to be regarded as unknown parameters which in the real case of confined quarks are defined by the self - consistence of the solution of the infrared problem .",
    "these states have an essential influence on the equations for the green s functions , which , as it will be shown in the next paper , can be used constructively in solving the confinement problem if the effective coupling in the infrared region is not too large . in this case",
    "the integro - differential equations can be reduced to a system of non - linear differential equations and the theory looks like a theory of particle propagation in self - consistent fields defined by the green s functions themselves ( as it is the case in landau s fermi liquid theory ) .",
    "the self - consistent fields are fields of gluons and @xmath3-mesons .",
    "in qed we have two green s functions : that of the photon @xmath4 and of the electron @xmath5 , and a vertex function @xmath6",
    ". the photon green s function is defined by the vacuum polarization operator @xmath7 which can be expressed symbolically by a sum of feynman diagrams @xmath8 in order to obtain series not containing divergences we will try to consider the derivatives of @xmath7 as functions of momenta . due to current conservation , we have @xmath9 where @xmath10 contains only logarithmic divergences .    differentiating ( [ 1.2 ] ) twice we will have @xmath11 we here use @xmath12 the second term in ( [ 1.3 ] ) does not contain divergences , the first one does . in order to obtain a finite expression , consider @xmath13 because of this , the quantity @xmath14 must not contain divergences .    in feynman gauge",
    "@xmath15 is equal @xmath16 the diagrams contain only the product @xmath17 and therefore @xmath18 in first order this means @xmath19 the integrals on the right - hand - side are convergent .",
    "this fact has to hold in any order .",
    "hence , we can include in ( [ 1.8 ] ) the exact electron green s functions and the exact vertex functions and add all the corresponding diagrams which were not included . as a result",
    ", we can write @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the sum over the permutations of the indices similarly to ( [ 1.8 ] ) ; a quantity @xmath22 corresponds to each photon line .",
    "( [ 1.9 ] ) is an equation for @xmath23 ( in the form of series in @xmath23 ) provided that @xmath24 and @xmath6 are known .    in order to obtain equations for electron green s functions and vertices we have to remember that these function can change rapidly even if @xmath23 is small because they can have infrared singularities of the type @xmath25 or ultraviolet singularities of the type @xmath26 .",
    "it is proven to be possible to arrange the differentiation in such a way that there will be an expansion only in @xmath23 .    to write an equation for the fermion green s function not containing any divergences",
    ", we have to differentiate twice the self - energy of the fermion or its inverse green s function .",
    "let us consider @xmath27 ; the diagrammatic expression for @xmath28 will be the following .",
    "the simplest diagram is @xmath29 diagrams of the next order are @xmath30 it can be easily shown that @xmath31 using this equality , we have @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 restricting ourselves to @xmath36 , we can write @xmath37 @xmath38 and , consequently , @xmath39 the term @xmath40 has a contribution to @xmath41 not containing overlapping divergences and is of the form @xmath42           & & + \\,\\ , {    \\setbox0=\\hbox{\\pandocstartinclude{fig22.pstex_t.tex}\\pandocendinclude{input}{9}{28 } }    \\picraise=-0.5\\ht0     \\advance\\picraise by 0.5\\dp0    \\advance\\picraise by 3pt         \\hbox{\\raise\\picraise \\box0 } } \\,\\ , + \\,\\ , {    \\setbox0=\\hbox{\\pandocstartinclude{fig23.pstex_t.tex}\\pandocendinclude{input}{9}{28 } }    \\picraise=-0.5\\ht0     \\advance\\picraise by 0.5\\dp0    \\advance\\picraise by 3pt         \\hbox{\\raise\\picraise \\box0 } }    \\label{1.12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the calculation of higher order diagrams it is convenient to adopt the following principle .",
    "beginning from the first point of interaction we shall relate the external momentum to the photon line : @xmath43 the next photon interaction can be expressed as @xmath44 now we relate the external momentum to the positron line . if the positron is emitting a photon , we keep sending the external momentum along the positron line up to its annihilation . as a result",
    ", we get a tree structure @xmath45 in which the initial photon line can end only at the final electron .",
    "it can be shown that every line in the diagram will be passed only once if the photons included in the fermion self energy are not taken into account .",
    "this means that in this approach exact electron green s functions have to be used with bare vertices since the idea is basically the exclusion of overlapping divergences .",
    "taking the second derivative of one of the photon propagators and restricting ourselves to the contribution @xmath46 we obtain both on the left - hand side and the right - hand side photon emission amplitudes with zero momentum . due to gauge invariance , however , a zero momentum photon can not change the state of the system ( it is emitted from the external end ) .",
    "the photon emission amplitude equals @xmath47 .",
    "the final contribution of the differentiation has the structure ( [ 1.11 ] ) .",
    "the above statement , which essentially means that the emission of a zero momentum photon is determined by the total charge , can be proven by the ward identity .",
    "thus , we have @xmath48 the remaining diagrams contain first derivatives of photon and positron lines and second derivatives of positron lines .",
    "all these diagrams can be expressed in terms of the exact @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 functions .",
    "they do not contain divergences except those graphs which correspond to the photon self energy .    the first term in ( [ 1.16 ] ) has the structure @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a quantity close to the compton scattering amplitude in the sense that they would be equal if we differentiated all photon propagators including those inside the electron green s function .",
    "( the factor @xmath54 is due to the fact that the compton amplitude contains the sum of diagrams with momenta @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) . the compton scattering amplitude @xmath57 satisfies the ward identity @xmath58 which has the simple diagrammatical meaning @xmath59 the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ 1.17 ] ) represents the contribution of photons which",
    ", if we carried out the mentioned differentiation , would correspond to photons inside the green s function and which are not present in @xmath60 . hence , @xmath61    the remaining diagrams in ( [ 1.16 ] ) contain first derivatives of photon and positron lines and second derivatives of positron lines .",
    "all these diagrams can be expressed in terms of the exact @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 functions .",
    "they do not contain divergences except those graphs which correspond to the photon self energy .",
    "all these diagrams are of the form @xmath62 and correspond to the photon line with the exact green s function ( [ 1.6 ] ) which equals @xmath63 . by differentiating the photon lines we have calculated the contribution of @xmath36 .",
    "so , there remains @xmath64 where we have introduced @xmath65 in order to avoid a contribution from @xmath66 .",
    "this expression contains logarithmic corrections coming from the ultraviolet region ( @xmath67 ) . replacing @xmath68 by @xmath69 and performing an integration by parts , we get @xmath70 the first term in ( [ 1.20 ] )",
    "can be explicitly calculated while the second one does not contain any logarithms because of the presence of the difference @xmath71 .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ 1.20 ] ) in the form @xmath72 consequently , @xmath73 can be expressed as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is defined by ( [ 1.20 ] ) and @xmath40 contains first order derivatives of the photon and positron lines and second order derivatives of the positron lines , as it has been explained above .",
    "the first term contains all singularities of the types @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "to obtain the equation for the vertex function , let us express @xmath78 as a set of diagrams containing exact green s functions : @xmath79 we shall relate the external momenta to the lines in the diagrams in the same way as we did when we derived the equation for the green s function . calculating the second order derivative in @xmath80",
    "we obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the contribution to the amplitude of the process @xmath83 which corresponds to the emission of photons with momenta @xmath84 from the external legs : @xmath85 inserting ( [ 2.3 ] ) into ( [ 2.2 ] ) and replacing @xmath65 by @xmath86 we get @xmath87 here we have introced the notations @xmath88 the correction terms @xmath89 are defined as a set of diagrams with exact green s functions and vertices .",
    "they contain first order derivatives of both the photon lines and the positron lines , second order derivatives of the positron lines and , in the same way as in the case of the green s function , corrections due to the replacement of @xmath65 by @xmath90 .",
    "the same equation is valid for the interaction amplitude of fermions with the external field provided this interaction does not depend on the relative momentum @xmath80 of the fermions .",
    "the equations for the interaction with external fields are essential . indeed , if these equations have solutions that decrease at large virtualities of the fermions ",
    "i.e. solutions which do not require driving terms  this means the existence of bound states .    for the sake of convenience",
    "we rewrite the equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) in the form @xmath91 which will be understood as the equation for the bound state with a spin which is defined by the invariant structure of the matrix @xmath92 .",
    "it is important to note that the accuracy of the equations for the vertex @xmath78 and for the bound states differs from the accuracy of the equation for the green s function . the functions @xmath78 and @xmath93 depend , among others , on the ratio @xmath94 .",
    "if this parameter becomes large , then @xmath49 and @xmath93 contain , in general , the so - called sudakov logarithms @xmath95 which are not included in the equations ( [ 2.4 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "hence , the equations are valid only if @xmath96",
    "qcd is the theory of interacting quarks and gluons .",
    "the description of quarks is more or less the same as in qed .",
    "gluons , however , are very different .",
    "even the fact that being a spin @xmath97 particle the gluon has to have a multi - component wave function is not seen explicitly . in the usual approach",
    "it is described by a green s function @xmath98 which in momentum space ( in feynman gauge ) always can be written in the form @xmath99 it contains only one unknown function .",
    "all spin properties of the gluon are included in the momentum dependence of its interaction . in order to introduce multi - component green s functions",

    "the reason is the following .",
    "the derivation of the equation ( [ 1.21 ] ) was based on the relation between the fermionic green s function and the amplitude of zero momentum photon emission by a fermion @xmath209 in the usual formulation this relation is not correct in qcd . the simple relation ( [ 3.28 ] ) for the amplitude of the zero momentum gluon emission by a gluon implies , however , that the amplitude of a zero momentum gluon emission by a quark has to be equal @xmath210 together with ( [ 3.23 ] ) it leads to the equation ( [ 1.21 ] ) .",
    "the equation for the colourless vertices remains also the same .",
    "the equation for a three - gluon vertex , however , will be essentially different . in the same way as for the fermionic case , but taking into account the non - commutativity of the gluon coupling , we can show that @xmath211 satisfies the following equation : @xmath212 @xmath213 the right - hand side corresponds to all possible gluon emissions from the external lines : @xmath214 @xmath215 higher order terms can be written in the same diagrammatic way . the third term in ( [ 3.43 ] ) and in the corresponding diagrammatic expression equals zero at @xmath216 since @xmath217 at @xmath216 .",
    "the equation ( [ 3.43 ] ) is , indeed , quite different from the equation for a colourless vertex .",
    "the main difference comes from the fact that on the right - hand side it contains derivatives of @xmath218 not only over @xmath80 but also over @xmath219 .",
    "hence , in order to find @xmath218 , we have to write three different equations for second derivatives over three different momenta .",
    "a similar equation is valid for the quark - gluon vertex .    knowing the green s function and the vertices , all the other amplitudes for the interactions and quarks and gluons can be written in the usual perturbative way .",
    "these amplitudes have no divergences and contain inside the gluon green s function the unknown function @xmath157 .",
    "to formulate the theory in an unambiguous way , without any references to the cutoff and the regularization , we have to find the equation for @xmath157 as we did in qed , and learn , how to write the higher terms more elegantly and constructively .",
    "i postpone the investigation of this problem to another paper .",
    "what i want to discuss now is the main difference between an asymptotically free theory and an infrared free theory .",
    "the equations for green s functions of quarks and gluons are proven to be second order integro - differential equations . to solve them ,",
    "we need boundary conditions . in an infrared theory",
    "the boundary conditions are known : they are the conditions for the existence of free elementary particles at small momenta . in an asymptotically free theory",
    "the interaction is small at large momenta , and we expect to have here a perturbative solution . however , in the region of large momenta all the equations have two types of solutions : the perturbative solution and solutions which decrease as some power of the momenta and therefore contain dimensional parameters reflecting the density of different condensates .",
    "these parameters have to be defined either by the introduction of additional conditions of the type of conservation laws or by the self - consistency of the solutions in the small momentum region ( or both ) .",
    "the next section of this paper will be devoted , essentially , to the discussion of this problem .",
    "in the present section we will consider the equation for the fermion green s function in qcd @xmath220 where @xmath221 this equation was discussed extensively [ 1 ] in connection with the problem of quark confinement .",
    "here we shall use the equation for the discussion of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in asymptotically free theories . the asymptotic freedom is reflected in this equation by the fact that @xmath222 decreases when @xmath223 .",

    "this way we will never get a massless goldstone state .",
    "the reason for this is the almost obvious fact that ( [ 5.9 ] ) and ( [ 5.11 ] ) contradict the condition of axial current conservation .",
    "let us consider the condition for current conservation in detail .",

    "it is obvious that even in an asymptotically free theory the goldstone boson has a point - like structure .",
    "amplitudes for the interactions of many goldstones with fermions can be found in an analogous way and have the same properties .",
    "the self - energy of the goldstone state is now different from ( [ 5.9 ] ) .",
    "it contains two terms @xmath420 and equals @xmath379 at small @xmath379 .",
    "as we already have said , in this approach the ward identity becomes the definition of the yukawa coupling @xmath131 ( the wave function of the goldstone boson ) through @xmath386 which has a clear diagrammatic meaning .",
    "the equation contains the amplitude @xmath421 of the goldstone  axial current transition . the expression ( [ 5.15 ] ) for @xmath422 is highly symbolic , because it contains overlapping divergences . in order to write a sensible expression",
    "we can use the same procedure as we did in section [ i ] when we calculated the polarization operator of the photon . applying the ward identity",
    ", we can write instead of ( [ 5.15 ] ) @xmath423 differentiating ( [ 5.22 ] ) over @xmath219 we will get for @xmath376 @xmath424 if we want to get rid of the @xmath425-s we have to commute @xmath425 with the green s functions and the interaction vertices along one of the fermionic lines .",
    "doing this , we obtain @xmath426 due to the conservation of the vector current , the first two terms in ( [ 5.24 ] ) are zero at @xmath376 .",
    "the first one is just the photon polarization operator at @xmath376 , the second one is the amplitude for the decay of a zero momentum scalar into two zero momentum photons .",
    "the last term looks like the zero momentum pseudoscalar  photon scattering amplitude which also has to be zero .",
    "this , however , is not true , because it does not contain all the necessary diagrams . it does not involve overlapping divergences . as a result",
    ", we can write @xmath427 in the zeroth order of @xmath428 @xmath429",
    "up to now we have discussed the goldstone states in a relatively abstract way without fixing the concrete asymptotically free theory . in real qcd we have quarks with different flavours and there is a difference between flavour singlet and flavour non - singlet states . in order to clarify the picture it will be useful to describe the goldstone state in a different way .",
    "the previous discussion shows that the goldstone states in asymptotically free and non - free theories are rather similar .",
    "therefore it is natural to try to introduce the goldstone boson in the usual way as a point - like state and to see how this state will interact . in the usual discussion of a goldstone particle",
    "we suppose that there is a point - like pseudoscalar interaction between this particle and a fermion with the pseudovector coupling @xmath430 this interaction induces the radiative correction to the propagator @xmath431 of the pseudoscalar @xmath432 @xmath433 is the bare pseudoscalar green s function .",
    "if the fermion is massless and the axial current is conserved , this pseudoscalar will not interact ; its self - energy @xmath434 is equal to zero .",
    "if , due to symmetry breaking , the fermion becomes massive , it starts to interact and acquires a self - energy different from zero . by using the diagrammatic definition of @xmath415",
    "we will find @xmath435 where @xmath421 is the same amplitude for the goldstone  current transition as what was discussed in the previous section .",
    "hence , @xmath436 in the limit @xmath437 we will have @xmath438 the pseudovector goldstone  fermion interaction is @xmath439 with a pseudovector coupling @xmath440 defined by the fermion mass .",
    "the limiting procedure @xmath437 can be understood if we accept that the interaction responsible for symmetry breaking changes the fermion vacuum fluctuations not only at finite momenta but also near the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "this change in the fermion vacuum fluctuations is responsible for the leakage of the axial current in the region of finite momenta ; it can produce the driving term for the goldstone state , recovering the current conservation .    in general",
    ", the pseudovector coupling has a disadvantage compared to the pseudoscalar coupling which we have discussed before : it looks unrenormalizable .",
    "but in the case of flavour non - singlet states it can always be replaced by the pseudoscalar coupling with the help of the trivial relation @xmath441 which leads to the ward identity ( [ 5.14 ] ) for pseudoscalar coupling . if we include the emission and the absorption of goldstone bosons inside the diagram , then in the process of this replacement a point - like amplitude appears which corresponds to the quark interaction with many goldstone bosons .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to prove that , due to the decrease of this amplitude as the function of quark virtuality , the theory is renormalizable .    due to the anomaly , the case of a flavour singlet current is very different even on the level of the goldstone green s function . in this case",
    "the corresponding polarization operator @xmath134 will contain not only the quark loop which we have discussed but also a gluonic contribution @xmath442 the triangle diagram @xmath443 included in ( [ 6.8 ] ) was calculated many years ago by adler , bell and jackiw [ 3 ] @xmath444 with this expression for @xmath443 , @xmath445 still has the form ( [ 6.4 ] ) but it will be quadratically divergent and @xmath446 where @xmath447 is the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "this means that goldstone particles exist in the anomalous case but they are decoupled from any physical state . at the same time the ward identity still makes sense because the product @xmath408 does not depend on @xmath421 .",
    "nevertheless , the concrete form of the ward identity will change .",
    "the reason for this is again the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly [ 3 ] . for the triangle diagram @xmath448 the replacement of the pseudovector coupling by the pseudoscalar coupling gives an incorrect result : instead of the correct expression @xmath449 which was obtained in [ 3 ]",
    ", we get just the first term .",
    "we can try to write the ward identity using ( [ 6.12 ] ) , but this turns out not to be necessary .",
    "the reason is that in this approach the axial current @xmath450 between gluonic states , defined symbolically by the relation @xmath451 ( where the term @xmath452 is defined diagrammatically and @xmath453 ) is just the transverse part of @xmath452 : @xmath454 for the axial current between quark states @xmath455 can be written as @xmath456 here @xmath457 is the same set of diagrams as in the non - singlet case and @xmath458 is the `` axial current of gluons '' @xmath459 in the same way the goldstone boson ",
    "quark interaction can also be divided into two parts . in the first part we can replace the pseudovector coupling by the pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "the second part is the longitudinal part of @xmath458 .",
    "consequently , @xmath460 and the ward identity can be written in the form @xmath461 this expression enables us to answer the question , what happens with particles like @xmath1 which were goldstone states if we would not take into account that they can decay into two gluons .",
    "let us consider the contribution of the massive pseudoscalar flavour singlet particle @xmath1 to the ward identity ( [ 6.19 ] ) .",
    "@xmath462 has a pole corresponding to @xmath1 : @xmath463 the yukawa coupling to the goldstone state has also a pole : @xmath464 the right - hand side of ( [ 6.19 ] ) has , however , no poles",
    ". this condition can be satisfied if @xmath465 the same ward identity ( [ 6.19 ] ) gives at @xmath375 @xmath466 from what it follows that @xmath467 for @xmath1 is equal @xmath468 this means that @xmath1 acquired a mass due to the transition into a goldstone boson which itself is decoupled .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at relatively small @xmath467 when the comparison between ward identities for different values of @xmath379 ( @xmath469 , @xmath375 ) makes sense , ( [ 6.24 ] ) gives us the same result as the equation ( [ 5.9 ] ) ( without the additional point - like term which is present in the @xmath3-meson case ( [ 5.21 ] ) ) . indeed , in ( [ 5.9 ] ) we can write @xmath470 the first two terms are equal to @xmath379 ( as in ( [ 5.21 ] ) ) and therefore @xmath471 in agreement with ( [ 6.24 ] ) .",
    "we see that the subtraction term in the @xmath3-meson self energy , reflecting the quasi - local structure of the pion , disappears in the case of @xmath1 . in this sense @xmath1",
    "is a normal bound state without a point - like structure .",

    "hence , at large @xmath266 we have @xmath483 .\\ ] ] at small @xmath266 around the qcd scale @xmath484 is defined by the total quark mass @xmath298 which is for the light quark much larger than @xmath320 . using the relations ( [ 7.1 ] ) - ( [ 7.3 ] )",
    "we can calculate the the masses of the pseudoscalar octet in the same way as we did for @xmath1 .",
    "suppose there is a bound state of light quarks which is a pseudoscalar particle ( the @xmath3-meson ) with a finite mass @xmath389 .",
    "the pole corresponding to this particle will contribute to both terms in ( [ 7.2 ] ) . with this pole contribution ,",
    "@xmath485 and @xmath484 can be written in the form @xmath486 @xmath487 as in the case of @xmath1 , the condition for the pole cancellation gives us the value of @xmath467 : @xmath488 at @xmath375 we have @xmath489.\\ ] ] the yukawa coupling @xmath490 of the bound state has to decrease at large @xmath266 .",
    "therefore we have to identify @xmath491 with @xmath492 .",
    "then @xmath493 where @xmath494 is the isotopically invariant part of the quark mass term behaving at @xmath495 as @xmath496 .",
    "hence , @xmath497 is defined by weak interactions with goldstone states , and @xmath498 is determined by pion exchange .",
    "the conclusion of these considerations is that in the case of massive quarks the conservation of the left - handed @xmath472 current can play the same role for the calculation of the coupling and the masses of the flavour non - singlet pseudoscalar particles as in the massless case the conservation of the axial current .",
    "the result is that the masses become different from zero while the yukawa coupling remains the same at least for small @xmath320 values .",
    "the expression ( [ 7.6 ] ) for @xmath467 can be also obtained without discussing the current conservation , just by calculating @xmath499 as it is defined by ( [ 5.21 ] ) for the quark mass @xmath500 , keeping only the term linear in @xmath320 .",
    "it is in agreement with the old idea that @xmath320 influences the mass of the goldstone state but not its wave function .",
    "unfortunately , if we calculate @xmath467 by using ( [ 7.6 ] ) or ( [ 5.21 ] ) , we get a logarithmic divergence . for the @xmath3-meson mass",
    "the main divergent part equals @xmath501 ( here @xmath502 is of the order of @xmath503 ) .    in the standard model",
    "the behaviour of @xmath320 and @xmath504 can be calculated in a fantastically large region of @xmath266 : from 1 gev up to the scale where one of the couplings of the standard model ( @xmath505  the @xmath0-coupling , @xmath506  the yukawa - coupling or @xmath285  the coupling of the self - interaction of the higgs particles ) becomes of the order of unity . in the reasonable case when the @xmath0-coupling @xmath505 is the first to become unity this scale is equal to @xmath507 gev .    at @xmath508",
    "the behaviour of @xmath320 and @xmath504 is unknown .",
    "because of this , @xmath509 is not calculable in principle and it has to be considered as an arbitrary parameter .",
    "if we , however , assume that at @xmath266 larger than @xmath447 @xmath510 and @xmath511 become equal to zero , we will be able to calculate @xmath509 and , surprisingly , this calculation gives a reasonable value for @xmath509 with @xmath512 gev [ 2 ] .",
    "the expression ( [ 7.9 ] ) for @xmath513 is also in agreement with the naive expression @xmath514 with the important difference that now @xmath515 is defined not only by strong but also by weak interactions and it goes to infinity if the weak interaction is removed .",
    "from the previous discussion it is obvious that the small mass pion contribution has to be included in the equation for the light quark green s function .",
    "fortunately this is very easy to do .",
    "having in mind that now the diagrams contain not only the gluon contribution but also the emission and the absorption of pions we will find that as before , the main contribution to @xmath73 comes from the simplest diagram 0= = -0.50 by 0.50 by 3pt with the coupling @xmath516 at zero momentum instead of the gluon coupling @xmath517 .",
    "it leads to the following equation for the green s function : @xmath518 the equation for bound states ( [ 2.6 ] ) has also to be changed .",
    "the correction comes from the diagrams @xmath519 instead of ( [ 2.6 ] ) we will have @xmath520.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath285 is the emission amplitude of the zero momentum pion in the transition of the bound state to the @xmath2-pair .",
    "this amplitude has to be defined by the axial current conservation .",
    "there is another important quantity in this equation , namely : @xmath521 . in section [ v ]",
    "we have written an explicit expression for @xmath522 including only the gauge field contribution and ignoring the pion contribution .",
    "now we include the pion contribution in the equation for the green s function and , to be self - consistent , we have to do the same for @xmath522 .",
    "i was not able to carry out this in any order of the yukawa coupling , but in the first order of @xmath259 the equation ( [ 5.25 ] ) is correct if one adds the diagrams @xmath523 as we see , the gluonic correction of the order of @xmath428 and the pionic correction of the order of @xmath259 have the same diagrammatic structure . in order to estimate the value of these corrections ,",
    "let us take just the contributions of zero momentum gluons and pions to them .",
    "it can be shown that the contribution of zero momentum gluons cancels in the last two diagrams of ( [ 5.25 ] ) .",
    "zero momentum pion contribution comes only from the first diagram of ( [ 8.3 ] ) .",
    "transferring the differentiation from the fermionic line to the pionic line in this diagram we obtain the contribution of zero momentum pions in the form @xmath524 the expression for @xmath522 which includes the zero momentum pion contribution is @xmath525 it gives us an understanding of the scale of possible pion contributions .",
    "it is interesting to note , that ( [ 8.5 ] ) is not an expression in terms of the green s functions but an equation for @xmath521 .    in the next paper",
    "we will show that the pion contribution changes essentially the structure of the equation for the green s function .",
    "the new equation has a solution corresponding to the confined quark . at the same time the symmetry breaking solution will not necessarily survive ( at least if @xmath65 is large ) .",
