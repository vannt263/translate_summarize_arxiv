    "there is substantial evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) of mass @xmath7 exist and are the engines that power active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars @xcite .",
    "there is also ample evidence that smbhs reside at the centers of many , and perhaps most , galaxies @xcite , including the milky way @xcite .",
    "since quasars have been discovered out to redshift @xmath8 @xcite , the first smbhs must have formed by @xmath9 , or within @xmath10 yrs after the big bang . however , the cosmological origin of smbhs is not known .",
    "this issue remains one of the crucial , unresolved aspects of structure formation in the early universe .",
    "gravitationally , black holes are strong - field objects whose properties are governed by einstein s theory of relativistic gravitation  general relativity .",
    "general relativistic simulations of gravitational collapse to black holes therefore may help reveal how , when and where smbhs , or their seeds , form in the universe .",
    "simulating plausible paths by which the very first seed black holes may have arisen comprises a timely computational challenge ( see fig .",
    "[ eins ] ) .",
    "it is an area in which the tools of numerical relativity may be exploited to address a fundamental question in cosmology . performing such simulations",
    "may also help identify plausible astrophysical scenarios and sites for promising gravitational wave sources involving black holes .",
    "we are actively developing new algorithms and new computer codes to solve einstein s field equations of general relativity , coupled to the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics , in three spatial dimensions plus time ( 3 + 1 ) .",
    "as our codes have come online , we have applied them to explore different astrophysical scenarios involving strong gravitational fields and the generation of gravitational waves .",
    "these have included the inspiral and coalescence of binary neutron stars and binary black holes , the growth of instabilities in rotating stars , the nonlinear evolution of unstable stars , and the collapse and collision of rotating stars and rotating clusters of collisionless matter , to name a few .",
    "[ for recent reviews of simulations of compact binary stars and references , see @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "we have also performed a wide range of simulations in recent years to study alternative scenarios leading to the formation of supermassive black holes , or their seeds . [ for a review of these calculations and references , see @xcite ] here we will focus on one specific scenario , namely , the collapse of a rotating , supermassive star ( sms ) to a supermassive black hole .",
    "the formation of smbhs through the growth of black hole seeds by gas accretion is supported by the consistency between the total energy density in qso light and the smbh mass density in local galaxies , adopting a reasonable accretion rest - mass  to  energy conversion efficiency @xcite .",
    "but smbhs must be present by @xmath9 to power quasars .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that if they grew by accretion from smaller seeds , substantial seeds of mass @xmath11 must already be present at @xmath12 to have had sufficient time to build up to a typical quasar black hole mass of @xmath13 .",
    "a likely progenitor is a very massive object ( e.g. , an sms ) supported by radiation pressure .",
    "smss ( @xmath14 ) may form when contracting or colliding primordial gas builds up sufficient radiation pressure to inhibit fragmentation and prevent star formation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "smss supported by radiation pressure will evolve in a quasi - stationary manner to the point of onset of dynamical collapse due to general relativity @xcite unstable smss with @xmath15 and metallicity @xmath16 do not disrupt due to thermonuclear explosions during collapse @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent newtonian simulations suggest that evolved zero - metallicity ( pop iii ) stars @xmath17 do not disrupt but collapse with negligible mass loss @xcite .",
    "this finding could be important since the first generation of stars may form in the range @xmath18 @xcite . a combination of turbulent viscosity and magnetic fields",
    "likely will keep a spinning sms in uniform rotation ( @xcite ; but see @xcite and the final section below for an alternative ) . as they cool and contract , uniformly rotating smss reach the maximally rotating _ mass - shedding limit _  and subsequently evolve in a quasi - stationary manner along a mass - shedding sequence until reaching the instability point . at mass - shedding , the matter at the equator moves in a circular geodesic with a velocity equal to the local kepler velocity @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to understand the radial instability induced by general relativity in a sms by using an energy variational principle @xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 be the total energy of a momentarily static , spherical fluid configuration characterized by central mass density @xmath20 .",
    "the condition that @xmath21 be an extremum for variations that keep the total rest mass and specific entropy distribution fixed is equivalent to the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium and establishes the relation between the equilibrium mass and central density : @xmath22 the condition that the second variation of @xmath21 be zero is the criterion for the onset of dynamical instability .",
    "this criterion shows that the turning point on a curve of equilibrium mass vs. central density marks the transition from stability to instability : @xmath23    consider the simplest case of a spherical newtonian sms supported solely by radiation pressure and endowed with zero rotation .",
    "this is an @xmath24 , ( @xmath25 ) polytrope , with pressure @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant determined by the value of the ( constant ) specific entropy @xmath28 in the star . here",
    "@xmath29 is the temperature , @xmath30 is the baryon number density , and @xmath31 is the radiation constant . consider a sequence of configurations with the same specific entropy but different values of central density .",
    "the total energy of each configuration is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total internal radiation energy and @xmath34 is the gravitational potential energy . applying the equilibrium condition  ( [ 1var ] ) to this functional yields @xmath35 , i.e. the equilibrium mass depends only on the specific entropy and is independent of central density ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch]_a _ ) . applying the stability condition  ( [ 2var ] )",
    "then shows that all equilibrium models along this sequence are marginally stable to collapse .",
    "now let us account for the effects of general relativity .",
    "if we include the small ( de - stabilizing ) post - newtonian ( pn ) correction to the gravitational field , we must also include a comparable ( stabilizing ) correction to the equation of state arising from thermal gas pressure : @xmath36 where we have taken the gas to be pure ionized hydrogen .",
    "note that @xmath37 .",
    "the energy functional of a star now becomes @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the internal energy perturbation due to thermal gas energy and @xmath40 is the pn perturbation to the gravitational potential energy .",
    "applying the equilibrium condition  ( [ 1var ] ) now yields @xmath41 times a slowly varying function of @xmath20 ( see fig .  [ sketch]_b _ ) .",
    "the turning point on the equilibrium curve marks the onset of radial instability ; the marginally stable critical configuration is characterized by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the mass in units of @xmath44 .",
    "( here and throughout we adopt gravitational units and set @xmath45 . )    finally , let us consider a uniformly rotating sms spinning at the mass - shedding limit @xcite . a centrally condensed object like an @xmath24 polytrope",
    "can only support a small amount of rotation before matter flys off at the equator . at the mass - shedding limit ,",
    "the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy is only @xmath46 .",
    "most of the mass resides in a nearly spherical interior core , while the low - mass ( roche ) envelope bulges out in the equator : @xmath47 .",
    "when we include the contribution of rotational kinetic energy to the energy functional , we must now also include the effects of relativistic gravity to post - post - newtonian ( i.e. ppn ) order , since both @xmath29 and @xmath40 scale with @xmath20 to the same power .",
    "the energy functional becomes @xmath48 applying the equilibrium condition  ( [ 1var ] ) , holding @xmath49 , angular momentum @xmath50 and @xmath51 fixed , now yields @xmath41 times a slowly varying function of @xmath20 ( see fig .  [ sketch]_c _ ) .",
    "if we restrict our attention to rapidly rotating stars with @xmath52 ( the typical size of the seed black holes adopted in some recent galaxy merger simulations ; see , e .. g . , @xcite ) the influence of thermal gas pressure is unimportant in determining the critical point of instability .",
    "the turning point on the equilibrium curve then shifts to higher density and compaction than the critical values for nonrotating stars , reflecting the stabilizing role of rotation : @xmath53 the actual values quoted above for the critical configuration were determined by a careful numerical integration of the general relativistic equilibrium equations for rotating stars @xcite ; they are in close agreement with those determined analytically by the variational treatment .",
    "the numbers found for the nondimensional critical compaction and angular momentum are quite interesting .",
    "first , they are universal ratios that are independent of the mass of the sms .",
    "this means that a single relativistic simulation will suffice to track the collapse of a marginally unstable , maximally rotating sms of _ arbitrary _ mass .",
    "second , the large value of the critical radius shows that a marginally unstable configuration is nearly newtonian at the onset of collapse .",
    "third , the fact that the angular momentum parameter of the critical configuration @xmath54 is below unity suggests that , in principle , the entire mass and angular momentum of the configuration could collapse to a rotating black hole in vacuum without violating the kerr limit for black hole spin ( but see the next section below ! ) .",
    "there are several plausible outcomes that one might envision _ a priori _   for the dynamical collapse of a uniformly rotating sms once it reaches the marginally unstable critical point identified above .",
    "it could collapse to a clumpy , nearly axisymmetric disk , similar to the one arising in the newtonian sph simulations for the isothermal ( @xmath55 ) implosion of an initially homogeneous , uniformly rotating , low - entropy cloud @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the disk might develop a large - scale , nonaxisymmetric bar .",
    "after all , the onset of a dynamically unstable bar mode in a spinning equilibrium star occurs when the ratio @xmath56 ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for newtonian treatments and @xcite and @xcite for simulations in general relativity ) .",
    "since @xmath57 is @xmath58 at the onset of collapse and scales roughly as @xmath59 during collapse , assuming conservation of mass and angular momentum , this ratio climbs above the dynamical bar instability threshold when the sms collapses to @xmath60 , well before the horizon is reached .",
    "the growth of a bar might begin at this point .",
    "indeed , a weak bar forms in simulations of rotating supernova core collapse @xcite , but in supernova the equation of state stiffens ( @xmath61 ) at the end of the collapse , triggering a bounce and thereby allowing more time for the bar to develop . a rapidly rotating unstable sms",
    "might not form a disk at all , but instead collapse entirely to a kerr black hole ; not surprisingly , a nonrotating spherical sms has been shown to collapse to a schwarzschild black hole @xcite . alternatively",
    ", the unstable rotating sms might collapse to a rotating black hole _ and _  an ambient disk .    [ cols= \"",
    "> , < \" , ]      to @xmath62 and are separated by a decade .",
    "the final configuration has reached the mass - shedding limit and is toroidal and differentially rotating , with @xmath56 and @xmath63 .",
    "( from new & shapiro @xcite , width=226 ]    recently we have performed two simulations that together resolve the fate of a marginally unstable , maximally rotating sms of arbitrary mass @xmath49 . in @xcite",
    "we followed the collapse in full @xmath64 , but assumed pn theory .",
    "we tracked the implosion up to the point at which the central spacetime metric begins to deviate appreciably from flat space at the stellar center .",
    "we found that the massive core collapses homologously during the newtonian epoch of collapse , and that axisymmetry is preserved up to the termination of the integrations .",
    "this calculation motivated us @xcite to follow the collapse in full general relativity by assuming axisymmetry from the beginning to maximize spatial resolution ( see fig .",
    "[ sms ] ) .",
    "we found that the final object is a kerr - like black hole surrounded by a disk of orbiting gaseous debris .",
    "the final black hole mass and spin were determined to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the remaining mass goes into the disk of mass @xmath67 . a disk forms even though the total spin of the progenitor star is safely below the kerr limit .",
    "this outcome results from the fact that the dense inner core collapses homologously to form a central black hole , while the diffuse outer envelope avoids capture because of its high angular momentum .",
    "specifically , in the outermost shells , the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath68 , which is strictly conserved on cylinders , exceeds @xmath69 , the specific angular momentum at the innermost stable circular orbit about the final hole .",
    "this fact suggests how the final black hole and disk parameters can be calculated _ analytically _  from the initial sms density and angular momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "the result applies to the collapse of _ any _  marginally unstable @xmath24 polytrope at mass - shedding .",
    "maximally rotating stars which are characterized by stiffer equations of state and smaller @xmath30 ( higher @xmath70 ) do not form disks , typically , since they are more compact and less centrally condensed at the onset of collapse @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "the snapshots are taken after the stars have evolved for many central rotation periods , @xmath73 .",
    "stars with higher n exhibit a one - armed spiral m=1 instability .",
    "the panels show results for @xmath74 ; and @xmath75 .",
    "the contour lines denote densities @xmath76 .",
    "( from saijo , baumgarte & shapiro @xcite),width=340 ]    . the radius @xmath77 is the distance to the source and the ratio @xmath78 is the ( arbitrary ) compaction of the initial configuration .",
    "( from saijo , baumgarte & shapiro @xcite),width=340 ]    the above calculations show that a smbh formed from the collapse of a maximally rotating sms is always born with a `` ready - made '' accretion disk .",
    "this disk might provide a convenient source of fuel to power the central engine .",
    "the calculations also show that the smbh will be born rapidly rotating .",
    "this fact is intriguing in light of suggestions that observed smbhs rotate rapidly ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the implosion will result in a _",
    "burst _ of gravitational waves .",
    "current relativistic collapse calculations for this problem break down soon after the apparent horizon of the hole approaches its asymptotic size . moreover , the need to resolve the centrally condensed inner core precludes extending the numerical grid very far out into the wave zone .",
    "these two restrictions prevent a reliable determination of the complete burst waveform at present .",
    "crude estimates can be generated for the frequency and amplitude based on the quadrupole formula , and the results suggest that they are well within the range of detectability for lisa for a reasonable spectrum of masses .",
    "more interesting , perhaps , is the possible generation of _ quasi - periodic _ gravitational waves from nonaxisymmetric instabilities that might arise in the ambient disk ; the characteristics of these waves are likely to be comparable those discussed in the next section and in eqn .",
    "( [ hplus ] ) below .",
    "the previous analysis assumes that a combination of turbulent viscosity and magnetic fields combine to keep a spinning sms rotating _",
    "uniformly _ prior to the onset of collapse . while this is the most likely possibility @xcite , new and shapiro @xcite have discussed an alternative . in the absence of viscosity or magnetic fields ,",
    "an evolving sms will conserve angular momentum on cylinders as it cools and contracts in a quasi - stationary manner .",
    "so even if it is rotating uniformly at formation , it will evolve to a state of _ differential _ rotation .",
    "our evolution calculations indicate that an axisymmetric configuration that is slowly rotating uniformly and nearly spherical at birth ( @xmath79 ) will evolve to a differentially rotating toroid ( see fig .",
    "[ diff ] ) .",
    "prior to encountering any relativistic radial instability , the star reaches the mass - shedding limit , at which point @xmath56 and differential rotation is extreme , @xmath80 .",
    "toroidal configurations which have high values of @xmath57 and substantial differential rotation and central mass concentration are subject to nonaxisymmetric dynamical instabilities , especially the one - armed spiral @xmath81 instability @xcite .",
    "softer equations of state with higher polytropic indicies are very susceptible to this instability ( see fig .  [ spiral ] ) , so this mode is likely to be triggered in a rotating sms should it evolve with low viscosity and magnetic field .",
    "such a mode typically induces a secondary m=2 bar mode of smaller amplitude , and the bar mode can excite quasi - periodic gravitational waves ( see fig .  [ wave ] ) .",
    "typical wave amplitudes and wave frequencies for a source at a distance @xmath77 are given by @xmath82 where we have set @xmath83 and @xmath84 in evaluating the above quantities .",
    "these values also apply to waves generated by bar modes that may arise in a similar fashion in the ambient disk surrounding the sms black hole that forms from the collapse of a relativistically unstable , uniformly rotating sms ( see discussion above ) .",
    "both the amplitudes and frequencies put these waves well within the detectable range for lisa for a realistic distribution of masses .",
    "future simulations that we are planning will explore this possibility in greater detail , and help resolve which scenario best describes the final fate of a rotating sms .",
