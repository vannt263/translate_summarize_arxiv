    "quantum interference effects due to external electric or magnetic fields have long been of great interest , since they demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the quantum state of particles by external fields and preserving quantum coherence .",
    "such interference effects stem from the coupling of monopole or dipole moment of the particles to the vector field or the electric and magnetic field via aharonov - bohm ( ab)@xcite , dual aharonov - bohm ( dab)@xcite , aharonov - casher ( ac)@xcite , and he - mckellar - wilkens ( hmw)@xcite effects . due to these effects , the wave function of the particle acquires a berry phase@xcite after traveling along a certain trajectory , and allows to utilize the berry phase to design various interferometers .    since the berry phase is a periodic argument , a natural consequence of field - induced interference effects is the flux quantization@xcite .",
    "application of magnetic flux quantization in solid state devices includes superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) , in which the berry phase due to ab effect combined with single - valuedness of the wave function yields a josephson current oscillating periodically with magnetic flux , from which the flux quantization is interpreted .",
    "the magnetic flux is defined as the inner product of magnetic field and the area enclosed by the trajectory ; and the smallness of the flux quantum @xmath0 is the reason behind the high precision magnetometer made by squid .    in this article , we show that flux quantization can also be introduced in dab , ac , and hmw effects in the same sense as flux quantization in a squid , i.e. , from the oscillation of monopole or dipole currents with flux in solid state devices .",
    "we follow the principle that the flux should be defined as the quantity that controls the interference effect but only depends on the field and the trajectory , whereas the monopole or dipole moments of the particles determine the flux quantum .",
    "this principle unambiguously yields a scalar for fluxes associated with monopole moments , but a vector for fluxes associated with fixed magnetic or electric dipole moments .",
    "we show that this general picture applies to a great number of devices in many different fields , including spintronic@xcite and excitonic@xcite systems , and provides a unified picture for all known field - induced interference effects for nonrelativistic particles with fixed monopole or dipole moments .",
    "this unified picture also motivates us to seek analog of devices that use ab effect in other interference effects .",
    "in particular , we show that the long sought hmw effect can be realized by bilayer exciton condensates proposed@xcite and observed recently in semiconductor heterostructures@xcite and bilayer graphene@xcite .",
    "a dc squid - like device is suggested to observe the interference of the exciton condensate .",
    "this device brings quantum hall systems and graphene into applications in quantum interference , and may in turn be used to determine the experimental value of the electric dipole moment of bilayer excitons .",
    "in addition , by comparing the interference effects due to monopole moments and that due to dipole moments , we recognize the importance of the non - gauge field nature of the interference effects involving point dipole moments , hence the possibility to observe them in open trajectory devices . as an example , we propose a single trajectory interferometer based on spin josephson effect@xcite , which acts as a @xmath1-junction where the phase of the josephson spin current can be arbitrarily controlled by a gate voltage .",

    "we first demonstrate flux quantization that stems from the oscillation of monopole or dipole currents as a result of quantum interference .",
    "this is best demonstrated within the framework of persistent current in a mesoscopic ring@xcite , in combination with the generic setup proposed in ref .   where monopole moments and dipole moments can be discussed on equal footing , as shown in fig .",

    "first we review the mechanism of persistent charge current due to ab effect in this setup , then we make analogy to the other three effects .    in the setup for ab effect ,",

    "the actual quantized values of @xmath32 and @xmath36 depend not only on their flux quanta @xmath37 and @xmath38 , but also on the direction of the fixed dipole moments .",
    "the oscillation of dipole currents with field has been discussed by balatsky and altshuler , who considered persistent spin currents in a @xmath39he ring@xcite , and the electric flux quantum @xmath40 has been introduced by bogachek and landman@xcite . while these considerations refer to flux quantization in closed circuits ,",
    "our point is that this oscillation obeys a general principle of flux quantization where the proper definition of flux is a vector for fixed dipole moments .",
    "some devices may have more than one of the above effects , for instance the @xmath39he ring@xcite and a spin filter / reader proposed recently@xcite , in which both ab and ac effect contribute to interference .",
    "flux quantization can still be interpreted in these devices as long as one external field controls only one interference effect , for instance @xmath26 controls @xmath41 linearly , and causes the current to oscillate periodically . in the following sections , we address how quantization of flux vectors can be realized in concrete devices .",

    ", one may wonder if such a huge flux quantum and the resulting small phase shift can be of any use .",
    "below we demonstrate that in devices that contain rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which yields a phase shift also proportional to @xmath51 but with a much larger prefactor , the flux quantum may be experimentally observable .    a prototype interference device that utilizes rashba soc is the spin field effect transistor ( spin - fet)@xcite . in an ideal 1d spin - fet with length @xmath6 along @xmath52-direction , the spin degeneracy ( @xmath53 ) is lifted in the 2deg region where an @xmath26 field is applied along @xmath54 direction , described by @xmath55 , which corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath56 the rashba coupling corresponds to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represents the intrinsic soc of the 2deg , and @xmath59 characterizes the field induced soc .",
    "it is still debated whether the field dependence of @xmath60 comes from the expectation value of the electric field at the interface@xcite , or the asymmetry of the wave function in the quantum well@xcite , or other aspects of the wave function@xcite . for either mechanism to be true ,",
    "our point is that the rashba parameter can be _ empirically _ written in the form @xmath57 where @xmath26 is the external field depending only on the gate voltage and sample thickness . by preparing the spins in the source and drain in an eigenstate of @xmath61 , the tunneling probability , @xmath62 oscillates with @xmath63 which can be rewritten as @xmath64 therefore from the periodicity of tunneling probability , or equivalently the current - voltage characteristics , the quantization of @xmath32 is realized , with flux quantum @xmath65 .",
    "physically , the quantization of @xmath32 shows up because spin - fet utilizes the berry phase of spin up and down ( which are fixed magnetic moments ) to control the tunneling probability , so it falls into the category of field - induced quantum interference effect .",

    "although we discuss the flux quantization due to monopole currents and due to dipole currents on equal footing , a crucial difference between them should be emphasized .",

    "on the other hand , based on the non - gauge field character of the coupling between dipole moments and the external field , we demonstrate a unique feature of the interference effects of dipole moments : they can also take place in open trajectory devices , such as spin josephson effect .",
    "in particular we show that because of the reduced flux quantum in systems with rashba soc , quantization of electric flux vector may become accessible to experiment .",
    "in addition , realization of the long sought hmw effect of electric dipole moments by bilayer exciton condensate is proposed , where quantization of magnetic flux vector should be easily observable .",
    "the device we propose may in turn be used to quantify the size of an electric dipole or its relativistic coupling to the magnetic field in the experimental condition .",
    "finally , our calculation also indicates that ac and hmw effect , which were thought to cause only a small phase shift in atom interferometry , in fact also manifest themselves in a great number of solid state devices where the dipole currents are controlled by external fields .",

    "<S> by discussing field - induced quantum interference effects due to monopole moments and those due to dipole moments on equal footing , their similarities and differences are clarified . </S>",
    "<S> first , we demonstrate the general principle for flux quantization . for particles carrying a monopole moment </S>",
    "<S> , the interference causes monopole current to oscillate periodically with flux defined as inner product of field and area , whereas for particles carrying a fixed dipole moment , the dipole current oscillates periodically with flux vector defined as cross product of field and trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis unifies the oscillation of monopole or dipole currents in various devices , such as squid and spin - fet , into the same physical picture . </S>",
    "<S> second , we show that interference effects can also happen in open trajectory devices that transport dipole currents , such as spin josephson effect , based on the non - gauge field nature of the interference effects of dipole moments . in addition , we propose that the interference effect of electric dipoles , known as he - mckellar - wilkens effect , can be realized by the bilayer exciton condensates observed in semiconductor heterostructure and bilayer graphene . </S>"
