    "[ sec : intro ]    giant planets are common products of protoplanetary disk evolution but many of the details of their formation remain obscure and untested .",
    "core accretion is the dominant formation channel at small separations of @xmath910  au ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while disk instability ( @xcite ) and turbulent fragmentation ( @xcite ) operate on wider orbits at tens to hundreds of au . in these outer regions ( @xmath1010300  au ) , high - contrast direct imaging surveys",
    "are revealing that the tail end of the substellar companion mass function is likely to be continuous ( @xcite ) , extends down to at least @xmath15  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and overlaps with the most massive planets like hr  8799  bcde ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath5  pic  b ( @xcite ) , which probably formed in massive protoplanetary disks .",
    "in all formation scenarios , giant planets accrete most of their mass from circum - planetary disks , which naturally form around protoplanets in an analogous way to circumstellar disks around protostars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "circum - planetary disks regulate angular momentum transport and accretion as protoplanets grow , ultimately determining the final masses of giant planets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at the earliest stages of giant planet assembly ( @xmath93  myr ) , accretion shocks from circum - planetary disks onto protoplanets help to define planets initial entropy levels and which evolutionary pathways ( hot , warm , or cold start models ) they will follow ( @xcite )",
    ". moreover , the formation , bulk composition , and orbits of moons are also governed by properties of circum - planetary disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "physically , these disks are expected to be quite thick ( @xmath11/@xmath12 @xmath13 0.2 ) , possess little flaring compared to their circum - stellar analogs , and be tidally truncated to @xmath101/3 @xmath14 from gravitational influence of the host star ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this epoch of planet growth is challenging to directly study because of the small angular resolution and high contrasts required .",
    "the possible discovery of extended thermal excess emission from the candidate protoplanets lkca  15  b ( @xcite ) and hd  100546  b ( @xcite ) may represent the first direct detections of circum - planetary disks , though the masses and immediate environments of these embedded companions are still poorly constrained ( @xcite ) .",
    "the remnants of circum - planetary disks are evident from the prograde , regular satellites orbiting gas giants in our solar system as well as the ( possibly transient ) ring systems surrounding saturn , the substellar companion 1swasp  j140747.93394542.6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and perhaps fomalhaut  b ( @xcite ) .",

    "the clear detection at mm wavelengths implies a dust mass of 12  , sufficient to form a system of rocky moons .",
    "however , the high veiling and possible edge - on architecture of the this accretion disk makes the mass of fw  tau  c highly uncertain and possibly well above the planetary regime ( @xcite ) .    here we present alma 880  @xmath3 m continuum observations of gsc  6214 - 210  b , a @xmath115  companion orbiting the young ( 510  myr ) sun - like star gsc  6214 - 210  a in upper scorpius ( usco ) at 330  au . with a mass at the deuterium - burning limit and abundant evidence of ongoing accretion , gsc  6214 - 210  b is the lowest - mass companion with a circum - substellar disk currently known .",
    "alma s unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution at sub - mm and mm wavelengths presents a unique opportunity to characterize a sub - disk at the boundary between the brown dwarf and planetary mass regimes .",

    "this implies putative disk masses of @xmath75  @xmath8 for gsc  6214 - 210  a and @xmath715  @xmath8 for b. these results are most sensitive to the characteristic disk temperature , dipping to 0.03  @xmath8 ( 2.8 lunar masses ) of dust for a slightly warmer temperature of 25  k , and increasing to 0.9  @xmath8 ( 76 lunar masses ) for a temperature of 5  k. the lower limit on dust temperature is set by the diffuse interstellar radiation field and cosmic rays , which even for dense starless cloud cores that are shielded from external radiation is only about 10  k. so although our dust mass upper limit is highly sensitive to the dust temperature , we consider the dust mass of @xmath100.15  @xmath8 set by a @xmath38=10  k to be a fairly strict upper limit on sub - mm - sized particles and smaller .",

    "these differences could be caused by disk evolution owing to the different ages of these objects ( @xmath102  myr versus 510  myr ) , environmental influences from the nearby host star gsc  6214 - 210  a , natural variations in the physical properties of circum - substellar disks , and/or differing formation mechanisms .",

    "ultimately , the growing population of planetary - mass companions being found at hundreds of au ( @xcite ) combined with alma s unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution will make it possible to explore these effects for larger samples of free - floating and bound planetary - mass objects spanning ages of 110  myr .    in figure",

    "indeed , if the primary star gsc  6214 - 210  a harbors a disk , it must be at most a putative 0.0015% of the host star mass much lower than the median disk - to - star mass ratio of @xmath100.3% found at younger ages by @xcite .",
