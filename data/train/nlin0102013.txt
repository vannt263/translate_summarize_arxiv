    "this is to be contrasted with previous multibaker models of electric transport @xcite and thermoelectric cross effects @xcite where the inclusion of a reversible dissipation mechanism was necessary in order to simulate the effect of thermostating on the particle dynamics .",
    "the form in which thermostating appears in the present model is via a heat - source term in the microscopic energy dynamics ( which was already present in the model of cross effects @xcite ) .",
    "this term , however , does not give rise to phase - space contraction .",
    "the model has the following basic features : + ( a ) the time evolution of the system can be interpreted as that of weakly interacting particles . the resulting `` multi - baker '' gas obeys the classical ideal - gas equation of state .",
    "the particle and heat diffusion coefficient , and the kinematic viscosity are proportional to each other , as in the kinetic theory for classical ideal gases @xcite .",
    "+ ( b ) the distribution of a macroscopic velocity does not enter the entropy explicitly .",
    "rather the shear rate appears in the entropy balance via its influence on the temperature dynamics only .",
    "+ ( c ) the connection to a thermodynamic description of transport is achieved by considering fields , which are coarse grained in regions of small spatial extension .",
    "their properties are to be contrasted to those of fields characterizing the microscopic evolution .",

    "it provides the possibility to implement local irreversible cooling of the system , i.e. , to extract heat such that states which are permanently warmed up by viscous heating can become stationary . in traditional thermodynamics",
    "these terms are only present at the boundaries , and they vanish in the bulk . + ( f ) it is indicated how the velocity and the kinetic - energy dynamics can be implemented at the walls in order to achieve correspondence with different macroscopic boundary conditions .",
    "+ ( g ) when source terms are present in the bulk , the local entropy balance of nonequilibrium thermodynamics is generalized by introducing at every location an instantaneous flux of entropy ( i.e. , of heat ) into a thermostat ( the entropy flux is then no longer the divergence of the entropy current ) .",
    "the dynamics is in that case reminiscent of numerical algorithms based on gaussian thermostats .",
    "+ ( h ) the global entropy balance was worked out , in order to demonstrate that the total heat flux into a thermostat is independent to a large extend of whether thermostating is applied in the bulk or at the walls .",
    "the major interest of the present model lies in the light it sheds on the origin of viscous heating in deterministic models of transport .",
    "it was pointed out how fractal structures emerge in multibaker models for a variety of physical settings of shear flow . in all cases",
    "the structures arise from the mixing of regions with different local temperatures and flow velocities whose differences are exponentially proliferating to smaller and smaller scales for a nonequilibrium system .",
    "one can explicitly follow this redistribution of the kinetic energy , until it reaches the scale of the domains used to define local thermodynamic averages .",
    "motion at that scale has to be considered as contributing to the non - directional motion , hence leading to viscous heating .",
