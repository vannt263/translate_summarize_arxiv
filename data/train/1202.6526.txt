    "properties desirable for dynamics of networks of such binary units include robustness and quickness .",

    "it is known that the random boolean networks show long - tailed distributions of the transient length , implying that the transient is long on average @xcite . however , analytical evaluation of the transient length is difficult",
    ". therefore , we theoretically study the quickness of dynamics by introducing a new concept of state concentration , extending the previous statistical dynamical framework @xcite . in particular",
    ", the exponent of concentration , which we introduce later , is an analytically tractable quantity to measure the quickness of dynamics in the random boolean and majority vote networks . using this exponent , we investigate the compatibility of the robustness and quickness in these two types of networks .    for this purpose ,",

    "we show that strong state concentration , accompanied by a power law type of the indegree distribution with exponential cutoff , occurs in the majority vote networks ( dmn and smn ) but not for the boolean networks except for extremely sparse cases .",
    "then , we argue that the dmn is the only type among the four types of networks that realizes both robustness and quickness .",

    "however , in the random boolean network , the same flip probability is equal to @xmath176 , which quickly approaches @xmath177 as @xmath10 increases . in particular ,",

    "although the boolean network with @xmath170 has sufficient robustness , the dynamics in this case are frozen @xcite .",
