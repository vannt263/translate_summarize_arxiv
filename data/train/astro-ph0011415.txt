    "quasars are sparsely distributed across the universe , with the majority appearing to be unrelated to one another . however quasar clustering has been observed on large scales in the form of large quasar groups ( lqgs ) ( e.g. webster 1982 ; crampton , cowley & hartwick 1987,1989 ; clowes & campusano 1991,1994 ; graham , clowes & campusano 1995 ) , where 425 quasars form structures 100200@xmath11 across .",
    "they are thus comparable in size to the largest structures seen at the present epoch , such as the ` great wall ' of galaxies , but are seen at an earlier epoch with .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that lqgs represent the progenitors of these local large - scale structures , not only because of their comparable sizes , but also because of a claim that the comoving number densities of lqgs and local superclusters are comparable @xcite .",
    "observations of the galaxy environments of individual quasars lends credence to the hypothesis that lqgs trace superclusters .",
    "quasars at @xmath15 are known to favour young , low to moderately rich clusters , with richness increasing with both redshift and radio - loudness @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "a survey of 31 radio - loud quasars @xcite indicates that they are on average found in moderately rich ( @xmath16 ) clusters .",
    "optical and narrow - band ( oii ) observations of fields centred on 11 @xmath17 quasars from the crampton lqg show an excess of galaxies around all but one of the quasars ( hutchings , crampton & johnson 1995 , hereafter hcj ; hutchings , crampton & persram 1993 , hereafter hcp ) .",
    "in particular they find excesses of blue and emission - line galaxies around several of the quasars indicating regions of significant star - formation , a phenomenon probably related to the fact that both quasars and star - formation require the disruption of the galaxy causing a collapse of significant amounts of gas .",
    "they find no evidence for a coherent structure connecting the quasars , but star - formation is likely to be localised , rather than occurring simultaneously across large scales , as a cluster mass halo collapses or during a cluster merger .    to determine whether lqgs trace superclusters requires observations capable of identifying the quiescent galaxies that mark out any associated supercluster , in particular the massive ellipticals which dominate cluster cores .",
    "these are both the most luminous and the reddest galaxies in nearby clusters , and form a homogeneous population with very tight linear colour - magnitude ( c - m ) relations known as _ red sequences _",
    "@xcite , indicative of old ( 1213 gyr ) stellar populations .",
    "this red sequence has been followed in the optical for clusters out to @xmath18 ( aragn - salamanca 1993 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) and is consistent with the passive evolution of galaxies that formed in a monolithic collapse at @xmath19 @xcite . at @xmath20",
    "these galaxies should be characterised by extremely - red optical - nir colours ( @xmath21 ) as the 4000@xmath22 break is redshifted into the @xmath23 band .",
    "good contrasts of @xmath20 clusters over the background are possible as field @xmath21 galaxies appear rare : the hawaii k - band survey finds no galaxies with @xmath24 for @xmath25 over an area of @xmath26 ( cowie 1994 ; songaila 1994 ) .",
    "several @xmath9 clusters have been found by searching for galaxies with @xmath21 in fields around both targeted high - redshift agn ( dickinson 1995 , hereafter d95 ; yamada 1997 ; tanaka 2000a , hereafter t00a ) and regions of extended x - ray emission ( stanford 1997 , hereafter s97 ; rosati 1999 , hereafter r99 ) .",
    "these galaxies are found to have the optical - nir colours ( @xmath27 ) expected for passively - evolving galaxies which are 23 gyr old , in good agreement with the monolithic collapse model predictions .",
    "d95 also finds a red sequence for the @xmath28 cluster around the radio - galaxy 3c324 with @xmath29 and an rms scatter of only 0.07 mag , suggesting that these galaxies formed within 300 myr of one another .    in this study",
    "we aim to establish the galaxy environment of lqgs in a manner unbiased with respect to galaxy type .",
    "we have targeted a field containing three quasars from the @xmath30 clowes & campusano lqg ( fig .",
    "[ lqg ] ) for ultra - deep optical observations complemented with deep nir observations of selected subfields , capable of detecting the passively - evolving galaxies that should mark out any coherent large - scale structures .",
    "we present here the first results from this study , using ultra - deep @xmath31 and @xmath23 images and a @xmath10 image centred on the z=1.226 radio - quiet ( not detected at the 1mjy level by the first vla 20 cm survey ) quasar 104420.8 + 055739 .",
    "we have detected clustering of galaxies with the extremely - red colours expected of quiescent ellipticals at the quasar redshift . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt @xmath32 and .",
    "the field was observed through @xmath31 and @xmath23 filters using the big throughput camera ( btc ) on the blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory on april 21/22 and 22/23 1998 .",
    "the btc is made up of 4 @xmath33 ccds which have pixels of size 0.43 arcsec giving a field of view for each ccd of .",
    "the ccds are arranged in a 2 by 2 grid and are separated by gaps of 5.6 arcmin . to obtain a contiguous image it was necessary to shift the telescope between exposures .",
    "16 exposures arranged in a 4 by 4 grid , with each pointing offset by the gap width to adjacent pointings , were found to give a contiguous and almost uniform coverage over a field , with @xmath34 of the field covered by exactly 9 of the 16 exposures .",
    "the images had large relative offsets , and so that they could be registered , the effect of the distortions ( produced by the camera optics ) were removed using models based on observations of astrometric fields .",
    "these distortions are significant due to the wide field of the camera , and were of the order of 60 pixels at the corners of the ccd array .",
    "after the removal of distortions , the rms errors of registration between images were typically @xmath35 arcsec .",
    "details of the observing and reduction procedures for the whole btc image will be described elsewhere .",
    "most of the reduction processes were performed in the usual way using iraf tools .",
    "@xmath10 imaging was obtained for a field centred on the radio - quiet quasar at @xmath36 , @xmath37(j2000 ) using the ufti camera on the ukirt telescope in march 1999 .",
    "this has a field of with a pixel size of 0.09 arcsec .",
    "the field around this quasar was observed in preference to the other two because of its more populous immediate environment ( within 5 arcsec ) , suggesting that it was the most likely to be in an interacting system .",
    "no cluster - scale environmental factors were considered , and so , for the overall clustering statistics , the selection can be reasonably regarded as random .",
    "a standard 9 point jitter pattern was used , with each 1 minute exposure offset by 20 arcsec relative to adjacent exposures .",
    "a dark frame was obtained between each set of jitters , and subtracted before self - flattening the set .",
    "although the 20 arcsec wide strips at the edges of the image have only one third of the exposure time , they have been retained with each source checked visually , and separate magnitude limits determined .",
    "the combined @xmath10 image was convolved to the same seeing as the @xmath23 image , so that galaxy colours could be determined using a single fixed aperture , and then registered with the optical images .",
    "photometric calibration of the @xmath31 and @xmath23 images onto the landolt system was obtained using landolt standard stars at varying airmasses , and a ukirt faint standard was used for the @xmath10 image .",
    ".photometric properties of the images , including exposure times and completeness levels .",
    "the @xmath38 figures are for the area covered by the @xmath10 image , rather than for the whole btc field . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the expected background contamination from red field galaxies , @xmath39 , is unknown , and so we have estimated it to be half that of the @xmath2 field galaxies or 0.5 galaxies per square arcminute , as about half our @xmath2 galaxies are also classified as red ( ) . the probability that each galaxy is isolated , and hence due to the background component , is just the fractional contribution of the background density to the local density . the probability that galaxy @xmath40 is a member of cluster @xmath41 is then the fractional contribution of cluster a to the local density , after considering the background contribution , and for each of the red galaxies these probabilities",
    "are shown in table  [ probabilities ] .",
    "looking at this table and fig .",
    "[ densitymap ] it appears that the two clusters are well defined , with 11 out of the brightest 14 galaxies having probabilities greater than 0.90 of having been assigned correctly to cluster a or b. only galaxies # 4 and # 10 have significant doubt over cluster assignment , and # 12 appears to be isolated , whilst the four faintest red galaxies show no clear membership of either cluster , and may only be part of the combined structure .    as a second estimate of the significance of the substructure",
    ", we examine the null hypothesis that the galaxies are all members of a single cluster .",
    "one method for examining the null hypothesis is the likelihood ratio test statistic ( lrts ) ( ashman , bird & zeff 1994 ; kreissler & beers 1997 ) which evaluates the improvement in fitting the data of a two - component model over a single elliptical gaussian probability density function .",
    "the best - fit single elliptical gaussian @xmath42 to the data is found using the mean , @xmath43 , and covariance matrix , * a * , of the data , and this unimodal probability density function is used to create 10000 bootstrap catalogues of 18 galaxies each .",
    "the adaptive kernel estimator is applied to each bootstrap catalogue in the same way as the original data , and for those catalogues where bimodality is observed , the cluster membership probabilities @xmath44 , for @xmath45 are calculated . the probable number of galaxies in cluster @xmath46 is then given by .",
    "the best - fit double gaussians , @xmath47 , can then be found using the means , @xmath48 , and covariance matrices , @xmath49 , of the dataset weighted by @xmath44 for @xmath50 , before normalizing to @xmath51 .",
    "the measure of the fit by the g - component model is evaluated through the likelihood value @xmath52 the evaluation of the improvement in going from a single to a double gaussian fit is then given by the lrts @xmath53 .",
    "the significance of the substructure observed is estimated by the probability that a null hypothesis bootstrap catalogue produces a value of @xmath54 greater than the observed value .",
    "for the observed distribution , using 10000 bootstrap catalogues , we find that the substructure is marginally inconsistent with the null hypothesis at the 8.88% significance level .",
    "the low level of significance is due to the small number of galaxies involved , as many of the more significant substructures among the bootstrap catalogues were due to just 3 or 4 points that were within a few arcsec of one another .      as both groups are located near the edges of the @xmath10 image , and so may suffer from truncation , the full extent of clustering associated with the quasar is estimated by considering a @xmath55 field centred on the quasar from the btc @xmath31 and @xmath23 images .",
    "[ modelcols ] indicates that any @xmath20 quiescent galaxies should be amongst the reddest galaxies in @xmath56 , and so by selecting those galaxies with @xmath57 the density contrast due to any clustering at @xmath9 should be maximised .",
    "note that this selection criterion is slightly redder than the @xmath58 selection used previously , in order to reduce the contamination of intermediate - redshift quiescent galaxies . in the region covered by the @xmath10 image ,",
    "only the red galaxies are selected , including the 3 with @xmath59 .",
    "the estimated density distribution of @xmath60 galaxies is shown in fig .",
    "[ lss ] , and it is clear that the clustering extends well beyond the @xmath10 image . cluster a now appears to be centred on the northern edge of the @xmath10 image , and cluster b appears part of an elongated structure which extends 23 arcmin to the north - east .",
    "two further groups , each of 610 optically - red galaxies , are apparent 3 arcmin south of the quasar and 1.5 arcmin apart .",
    "the significance of the substructure formed by clusters a and b appears to be much higher now , as the density peaks are moved further apart .",
    "a re - examination of the null hypothesis , after including the @xmath57 galaxies outside the k image , finds the substructure to be inconsistent with the null hypothesis at the 1.86% significance level .",
    "the increase in significance suggests that the clusters were truncated by the boundaries of the @xmath10 image , but the increase is also due partly to the larger galaxy sample .",
    "there are two galaxies ( labelled c1 and c2 in fig .  [ spatial ] ) which are only 3 arcsec @xmath61 from the quasar , and could well be companion galaxies to the quasar galaxy host .",
    "compact companions are found for a significant fraction of quasars ( e.g. bahcall 1997 ) and spectroscopic observations confirm that many have stellar populations and redshifts within 500 km @xmath62 of the quasar ( e.g. stockton 1982 ; canalizo & stockton 1997 ) .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. stockton 1982 ; bekki 1999 ) that these companion objects are tidally - stripped cores from galaxies that have recently interacted with the quasar host galaxies , and that this interaction provides an efficient fuelling mechanism for quasar activities .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of the companion to quasar pg 1700 + 518 ( canalizo & stockton 1997 ) finds evidence for both a starburst event that occurred roughly 100 myr ago ( and so could be coincident with the quasar activation ) , and a relatively old stellar population likely to be from the merger progenitor disk .",
    "the galaxies c1 and c2 are bluer than the red sequence galaxies ( cf .",
    "c3 ) , and so , if associated with the quasar , they have undergone a recent episode of star - formation , presumably caused by the merger process .      to compare this quasar field with the results of hcj we have also examined the distribution of blue ( @xmath14 ) galaxies for @xmath63 ( indicated by star symbols in fig .  [ spatial ] ) .",
    "we find a concentration of blue galaxies within 30 arcsec @xmath64 of the quasar , which appears to be extended towards the north - east , forming a ` band ' that bisects the two groups of red galaxies .",
    "the band presumably corresponds to a region of enhanced star - formation .",
    "few , however , are found near the centres of either group of red galaxies . in comparison with adjacent fields ( over a region ) in the optical images we do not find an excess of blue galaxies .",
    "to examine the relative spatial distribution of red and blue galaxies , the angular cross - correlation function , @xmath65 , is determined ( see fig .",
    "[ twopoint ] ) , where @xmath66 is the number of red - blue galaxy pairs with separation @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the expected number of pairs with one member from the red catalogue and the other from one of 10000 randomly distributed catalogues .    at small separations ( @xmath69 )",
    "the red and blue galaxies are strongly anti - correlated at the @xmath70 level , confirming the apparent avoidance of the red groups by the blue galaxies in fig .  [ spatial ] .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath71 , there is a correlation at the @xmath70 level between red and blue galaxies , which is due to the ` band ' of blue galaxies that bisects the two groups of red galaxies .",
    "the blue galaxies do not contribute to the excess of galaxies observed at @xmath72 , as only 9 of 51 are detected in @xmath10 , the brightest having @xmath73 .",
    "these 9 all have the red @xmath74 colours indicative of @xmath20 galaxies ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ zdist]d ) , of which 6 help make up the concentration @xmath7530 arcsec from the quasar , which suggests that this at least is real .",
    "however , given that the @xmath56 colour is affected much more by recent star - formation than redshift , we can not say anything about the likely redshift of the remaining blue galaxies .",
    "we have found a @xmath76 excess of @xmath72 galaxies in the field around the z=1.226 radio - quiet quasar 104420.8 + 055739 from the clowes - campusano lqg . the excess is due entirely to a factor @xmath311 overdensity of red ( @xmath2 ) galaxies , which must have @xmath77 to explain their colour . in particular , we find cluster red sequences of 1518 galaxies , in the @xmath74 and @xmath78 against @xmath10 c - m diagrams at @xmath79 , comparable in both colour and magnitudes to red sequences observed for other @xmath9 clusters .",
    "these red sequences suggest a population of massive ellipticals at the quasar redshift . in the area of the @xmath10 image",
    "we find tentative evidence of substructure amongst these galaxies , with two apparent groups 40 arcsec to the north and 60 arcsec to the south - east of the quasar .",
    "an examination of the optical images over a area indicates that this substructure is significant at the 2% level , and that the clustering extends well beyond the @xmath10 image , forming a large - scale structure across .",
    "the overall structure is suggestive of being the early stages of formation of a cluster from the progressive coalescence of subclusters .",
    "only half of the excess of @xmath2 galaxies is accounted for by the red sequence members , and we find comparable numbers ( 1520 ) of ` red outlier ' galaxies with both @xmath2 and @xmath13 , which appear to fit neither the passively - evolving nor exponentially - decaying sfr galaxy models ( fig .",
    "[ modelcols ] ) .",
    "although , all we can say is that they are likely to be dusty star - forming galaxies at @xmath80 , given that such galaxies are found around other @xmath9 clusters ( e.g. t00 ; kajisawa 1999 ; 2000 ) , and given their comparative rarity in field regions , it seems reasonable to assume that they are associated with the cluster .",
    "this would suggest that the butcher - oemler effect observed in intermediate - redshift clusters increases in strength to higher redshifts , with @xmath12 of likely cluster members exhibiting the blue colours of recent star - formation .",
    "we also find a concentration of blue ( @xmath14 ) galaxies within 30 arcsec @xmath81 of the quasar , with many having the red @xmath74 colours of @xmath20 galaxies , which suggests that the quasar lies in a region of enhanced star - formation , in agreement with the results of hcj .",
    "this concentration appears extended in such a way as to separate the two groups of red galaxies , and it is also notable how the blue galaxies appear to avoid the centres of red galaxy clustering .",
    "some foreground contamination is likely , but given that such concentrations appear common around lqg quasars at this redshift , and the highly significant spatial interrelation between the blue and red galaxies",
    ", then we can be reasonably confident that this concentration is real , and is associated with the quasar . however spectroscopic observations of these and the other cluster candidates will be required to confirm cluster membership , and to provide more quantitative information about their star - formation histories , such as their approximate ages and current star - formation rates .",
    "the relative distribution of red and blue galaxies can be explained if what we are witnessing is the early - stages of merger of the two clusters of red galaxies , which has triggered both the band of enhanced star - formation and the quasar itself .",
    "a comparable distribution has been observed for the coma cluster @xcite with a band of post - starburst or ` e+a ' galaxies located between the coma cluster centre and a secondary x - ray peak .",
    "dynamical studies @xcite indicated that these galaxies had passed through the centre of the coma cluster about 2 gyr ago , coincident with the epoch of starbursting predicted from the spectra of the post - starburst galaxies . unusually high blue galaxy fractions have been observed for a number of low - redshift clusters with bimodal x - ray surface brightness profiles @xcite , implying that cluster mergers can induce starbursts simultaneously in a large fraction of cluster galaxies , and they could be a major contributor to the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested that could cause firstly the triggering and then the termination of a secondary burst of star - formation in a galaxy , as a subcluster passes through a cluster .",
    "these include ram pressure from the icm @xcite , shocks due to collisions between the two icms @xcite , and the effect of close galaxy encounters @xcite . as the ` band ' of blue galaxies is likely to be undergoing or has recently undergone star - formation , and because the two groups are relatively close together , we suggest that this system is being observed at an earlier epoch of the cluster merger process than caldwell ( 1993 ) , either just before or just after core passage , and that the star - formation has been triggered by the interaction of galaxies with the shock fronts produced by the collision of the two icms ( see roettiger 1996 ) .",
    "cluster merging events are predicted to be relatively common at high redshifts ( @xmath20 ) in hierarchical clustering models ( e.g. press & schechter 1974 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ; percival & miller 1999 ) .",
    "examples of possible merging clusters at high redshifts are the cl0023 + 00423 groups at z=0.8274 and 0.8452 which , according to a dynamical study , have a 20% chance of merging @xcite , and the r99 and s97 clusters which are separated by only @xmath82 .      in a study of 7 radio - loud quasars at @xmath83 ,",
    "snchez & gonzlez - serrano ( 1999 ) find excesses of faint ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) galaxies on scales of @xmath86 arcsec and @xmath87 arcsec around the quasars , whose numbers , magnitudes and angular extensions are compatible with being clusters of galaxies at the quasar redshifts .",
    "in particular however , they find that the quasars are in general not located at the peaks of the density distribution , but are some 40100 arcsec from them , located on the cluster peripheries .",
    "this result , and our own , is understandable in the framework of quasar activity being triggered by the infall of gas onto a seed black hole .",
    "firstly , galaxies in the centres of clusters have previously lost most or all of their gas , by having had it stripped off by ram - pressure from the intra - cluster medium or by tidal forces from close encounters with other galaxies , or by consuming the gas in a starburst during its first infall into the cluster .",
    "secondly , the encounter velocities for galaxies in the cluster cores greatly exceed the internal velocity distribution of the galaxies , making galaxy mergers much less effective at triggering nuclear activity @xcite .    in a comparable study of the galaxy environment of the radio - loud quasar 1335.8 + 2834 from the @xmath17 crampton ( 1989 ) lqg , tanaka ( 2000a ) obtain results which have several similarities to our own .",
    "this quasar had been part of the hcj study , and was known to lie in a band of blue and emission - line galaxies . using deep @xmath88 and @xmath10 observations ,",
    "a number of extremely - red objects with the colours of passively - evolving galaxies at the quasar redshift were found , forming a cluster which lies to one side of both the quasar and the band of blue and emission - line galaxies .",
    "they also find a similar population of ` red outliers ' and estimate the blue galaxy fraction as 6080% .",
    "they also find an indication that this cluster is part of a larger structure with groupings of optically - red ( ) galaxies , similar to the clustering near the quasar , found across the ( at z=1.086 ) @xmath88 optical images",
    ".    in a wide - field ( @xmath89 ) optical imaging survey of the 1338 + 27 field containing 5 quasars from the crampton ( 1989 ) lqg , tanaka ( 2000b ) detect significant clustering of faint red galaxies with @xmath90 and .",
    "these galaxies are concentrated in 45 clusters forming a linear structure of extent @xmath91 that is traced by the group of quasars , although only the one radio - loud quasar of t00a appears to be directly associated with any of the rich clusters .",
    "the immediate environments of the other four lqg quasars , all radio - quiet , appear relatively poor in terms of red galaxies , although three have excesses of blue and emission - line galaxies ( hcj95 ) indicating that they are located within regions of enhanced star - formation .",
    "this is the clearest evidence yet that lqgs trace large - scale structure , even if the majority of the member quasars are only directly associated with regions of enhanced star - formation , rather than rich clusters .",
    "as several of the hcj quasars were found in regions of enhanced star - formation , and as both the quasar of t00a and this paper are located in ` bands ' of enhanced star - formation , in between , or on the peripheries of , clusters , we propose a causal link between the quasar and star - formation whereby both are triggered by the same mechanism : the interaction between the galaxy and the intra - cluster medium . if a galaxy can be disrupted sufficiently by its passage through the icm to cause it to undergo starbursting , then if it also contains a supermassive black hole , enough gas may be channelled onto the nucleus to trigger a phase of quasar activity .",
    "such a mechanism explains the finding of quasars in regions of enhanced star - formation more naturally than the galaxy merger model , as it allows many galaxies to be affected simultaneously , although there is good evidence that a large fraction of quasars have been triggered by galaxy mergers .",
    "if there is a connection between the quasar and star - formation activation , then it is likely that these quasars are found preferentially in clusters with high blue galaxy fractions , and that these are not representative of @xmath9 clusters as a whole .",
    "this work and previous studies show that searching for sources with the @xmath2 colours characteristic of quiescent galaxies at @xmath20 is an efficient means of locating @xmath20 clusters . by adding a second optical band it is then possible to obtain qualitative information on the star - formation history of these galaxies . using this information along with the relative spatial distribution of quiescent and star - forming galaxies ,",
    "a more complex picture arises in which the evolution of galaxies , quasars and clusters are all interrelated .",
