    "recent data on the production of @xmath5 and @xmath0 at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at intermediate @xmath6 have revealed important properties of the @xmath7 quarks in the dense medium created by the collision of au nuclei at 200 gev @xcite .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath0 exhibit exponential behavior in their @xmath6 distributions up to @xmath8 gev / c .",
    "such properties of the @xmath5 and @xmath0 spectra have been reproduced in @xcite as consequences of recombination of thermal partons .",
    "the implication is that before hadronization the dense system consists of thermalized partons that include the @xmath7 quarks .",
    "that is the main characteristic that quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) should possess .",
    "the production of @xmath5 and @xmath0 provides a clear window through which one can observe the thermal source without the contamination of shower partons due to hard scattering , which is suppressed for @xmath7 quarks . since qgp is a description of the bulk medium , one can reasonably ask what the properties are at the edge of that medium , namely , when the partonic @xmath9 is @xmath10 gev / c .",
    "recent data from star on correlation that uses @xmath0 as trigger in the intermediate @xmath6 region has revealed interesting properties of the associated particles @xcite .",
    "the dual features of the exponential spectrum of @xmath0 and the existence of associated particles above background have been referred to as the @xmath0 puzzle @xcite .",
    "this paper is aimed at providing a quantitative resolution of that puzzle .",
    "particles produced at intermediate and high @xmath6 in heavy - ion collisions are associated with jets due to hard scattering of partons .",
    "the medium effect on hadronization has been successfully described in the recombination model in terms of the recombination of thermal and shower partons @xcite .",
    "the single - particle @xmath6 distributions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are well reproduced , showing power - law deviation from the exponential behavior at low that is due to the recombination of thermal partons .",
    "the hadronization mechanism that works for those particles that have light quarks as constituents does not work for the production of @xmath0 that contains only @xmath7 quarks .",
    "strange shower partons are suppressed whatever the initiating hard parton may be @xcite . for that reason the @xmath6 distribution of @xmath0 is essentially exponential up to the highest measured value of nearly 6 gev / c @xcite , as has been well reproduced by the recombination of three thermal @xmath7 quarks @xcite .    since shower @xmath7 quark",
    "does not participate in the formation of @xmath0 , it is natural to conclude that jets play no role and that the production of @xmath0 is not accompanied by any associated particles , which are usually present in events triggered by less strange hadrons .",
    "the distributions of associated particles in the latter case have also been satisfactorily described by the recombination of thermal and shower partons in @xmath6 @xcite , as well as in @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . without jet production",
    "there should be no jet structure characterized by associated particles distinguishable from the background .",
    "the discovery that @xmath0 trigger is accompanied by associated particles above the background has been astounding @xcite .",
    "how can a trigger particle formed by thermal partons have partners above the background , since they are presumably also of thermal origin ? that is the @xmath0 puzzle .",
    "conventional jet structure consists of a peak above a pedestal , when the trigger momentum ( @xmath16 ) and those of the associated particles ( @xmath17 ) are not too high . star has adopted the terminology jet ( j ) for peak and ridge ( r ) for pedestal .",
    "the j to r ratio of their yields depends on @xmath16 , @xmath18 and centrality @xcite . for @xmath19",
    "gev / c and @xmath20 gev / c in central au - au collisions at 200 gev , it has been shown that @xmath21 . however , at lower values of @xmath17 the @xmath22 ratio is smaller , becoming as low as @xmath23 at @xmath24 gev / c @xcite . for @xmath25-triggered events",
    "that ratio is even lower @xmath26 .",
    "no data for that ratio yet exist for @xmath0-triggered events , but one may anticipate it to be further lower according to the trend of increasing strangeness .",
    "if that is true , then the particles associated with @xmath0 will not exhibit any significant peak in the @xmath14 distribution , which is where j and r are usually seen with non - strange triggers . on the basis of the study done in @xcite , where @xmath0 is shown to originate from thermal sources , we can assert that the jet component should be absent , and that only the ridge will be observed .",
    "the notion of phantom jet was suggested in @xcite to describe the phenomenon in which a jet is produced without the jet part being observed .",
    "the ridge that is observed provides the evidence that there is an underlying jet .",
    "such a scenario has not been confirmed by data , but is our conjecture as a solution to the @xmath0 puzzle , the quantitative description of which will be given in the following two sections .",
    "a confirmation would be in evidence when the @xmath0-triggered @xmath14 distribution exhibits a ridge without a peak . at this point the statistics in the data for @xmath27 gev / c and @xmath28 is not high enough to give a discriminating @xmath29 distribution .",
    "what is seen in the @xmath15 distribution can not distinguish jet from ridge because there is no elongation in the @xmath5 direction as there is in the @xmath30 direction due to longitudinal expansion @xcite .",
    "a phantom jet is seen as an ordinary jet if the trigger is a non - strange particle .",
    "it may be initiated by a gluon or a light quark , which can generate non - strange shower partons that hadronize as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath16 is not too high , the hard scattering may occur in the interior of the bulk medium .",
    "the scattered hard parton traverses the medium and loses energy on its way out to the surface .",
    "the energy deposited in the medium enhances the thermal motion of the partons in the vicinity of the trajectory .",
    "those partons hadronize and form the ridge that is above the background .",
    "such a sequence of processes is conventional , and has been described successfully in @xcite that gives both the @xmath14 and @xmath15 distributions .",
    "however , the @xmath0-triggered events are notconventional , even though the underlying jet is conventional as described above .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath7 quarks are suppressed in the shower . without the @xmath7 shower partons @xmath0",
    "can not be formed as a direct consequence of hard scattering .",
    "it can , however , be formed indirectly from the ridge that is thermal and has ample supply of @xmath7 quarks .",
    "events triggered by @xmath0 produced that way are rare at high @xmath31 , since the thermal spectrum is exponential . thus the @xmath32 threshold is set low , like 2.5 gev / c .",
    "the corresponding @xmath17 threshold is even lower , like 1.5 gev / c , in order to have enough statistics to produce a meaningful associated particle distribution .",
    "when @xmath17 is so low , the ridge component dominates over the peak so the j / r ratio is very small .",
    "the ordinary jet thus becomes a phantom jet under the condition of low @xmath16 and lower @xmath17 .",
    "if the ridge can supply @xmath7 quarks to form the @xmath0 trigger , it can surely supply light quarks to produce other lower - mass charged hadrons .",
    "those are the associated particles detected @xcite .",
    "thus the ridge of the phantom jet is the key to the solution of the @xmath0 puzzle .",
    "the @xmath0 has a @xmath6 distribution that is exponential , on the one hand , because it is formed by the thermal partons in the ridge , and it has associated particles , on the other hand , because the ridge is above the background .",
    "our aim now is to describe the @xmath15 distribution of the associated particles in events triggered by @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the signal is less than 4% of the background height .",
    "thus in order for us to reproduce quantitatively the signal , it is necessary to show first that the background can be accurately obtained in our formalism .",
    "there is a @xmath33 oscillation due to elliptic flow , resulting in @xcite @xmath34 for the background .",
    "we aim to get the central value of 6.9 from the single - particle distribution of pion for @xmath35 gev / c that we have obtained previously @xcite .",
    "the experimental conditions are that in 0 - 10% central au - au collisions at 200 gev / c the @xmath0 trigger is detected in the window @xmath36 gev / c with @xmath37 and the unidentified charged particles associated with it are in the range of @xmath38 .",
    "let the trigger distribution be denoted by @xmath39 and the two - particle distribution by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 being short for @xmath44 .",
    "the associated particle distribution per trigger is then @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 all in units of gev / c . for the background distribution @xmath49",
    "is factorizable , i.e. , @xmath50 it follows that on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) the @xmath51 integrations in the numerator and the denominator are trivially cancelled , leaving @xmath52 where @xmath53 since @xmath37 , @xmath14 ranges from @xmath54 to @xmath55 . assuming @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57",
    ", we obtain upon integration of ( [ 7 ] ) over @xmath14 @xmath58 for 0% centrality there is no azimuthal asymmetry , so the @xmath59 distribution of the background is uniform .",
    "we can determine @xmath60 from our previous work on recombination model @xcite so as to establish a connection with that formalism , on the basis of which we shall calculate the ridge in the next section .",
    "the particles in the background are formed by the recombination of thermal partons , whose invariant distribution is @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 the recombination of those partons to form thermal pions is given by @xcite @xmath63 where the recombination function @xmath64 , @xmath65 being the momentum fraction , has been used in the integral above .",
    "that is for any one of the three charge states of pions . for the charged pions we gain a factor of 2 . for other charged particles , we take @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath13 , as for all momentum symbols , denotes transverse momentum .",
    "the numerical factors can be taken to be @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( gev / c)@xmath70 as reasonable approximations of the data , where the linear growth in @xmath13 of the ratio @xmath71 is approximately valid up to about 3 gev / c @xcite .",
    "thus for unidentified charged particles in the background we adopt for the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) the form @xmath72 upon integration over @xmath73 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , we obtain n^bg ( p_1 , ) = 4 3 ( c_0 t_0)^2 h(p_1 , t_0 ) , [ 13 ] where h(p_1 , t_0)f(,t_0)- f(,t_0 ) , [ 14 ] with f(x , t_0)= ( 1 + b ) ( 1 + x ) + ct_0 ( 2 + 2x + x^2)e^-x . [ 15 ]    to carry out the integrations over @xmath75 in eq.([6 ] ) we need the single - particle distribution for the production of @xmath0 , which can be determined in the same way as for proton by recombination @xcite , except that it is simpler when only thermal @xmath7 quarks contribute .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 the normalization factor @xmath79 is immaterial , since it appears in both the numerator and the denominator of eq.([6 ] ) , so they cancel each other .    integrating both over @xmath75 and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , we finally have @xmath80 where @xmath81 the last term on the right hand side of eq.(19 ) is given by @xmath82 \\frac{x^3}{(x^2+\\mu_{0s}^2)^{1/2}}\\,e^{-x } , \\label{20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the variable of integraton @xmath83 . the limits of integration are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "the other symbols are @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the denominator of the first factor is given by @xmath90 with the integration variable @xmath83 .",
    "other symbols @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are respectively @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .    for the trigger momentum range being specified by @xmath97 and @xmath98 given just below eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , the effective value of @xmath75 found for @xmath99 is 2.8 gev / c . using the parameters for the thermal partons given in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , we can now compute the background height for the associated particles and obtain @xmath100 this result agrees well with the data @xcite , and gives us confidence in the formalism to proceed to the calculation of the ridge .    it should be noted that the @xmath0 spectrum is stated in eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) without reference to it being in the ridge , since the calculation was done in @xcite using a fitted value of @xmath101 .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath101 being slightly higher than @xmath102 is a hint that the thermal source is enhanced .",
    "but the procedure of calculating the hadron distribution by recombination of thermal partons is insensitive to whether the thermal source is enhanced or not .",
    "since our resolution of the @xmath0 puzzle is based on the validity of the assertion that both the trigger and its associated particles are formed from the ridge , we must now show that the @xmath1 distribution of the associated particles from that source agrees with the data @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the ridge follows essentially the procedure used in @xcite , except that we are hampered this time by the lack of data on @xmath14 distribution that was available for unidentified charged triggers . indeed , to be sure that one has a ridge , it is usually necessary to find it in the @xmath57 distribution that exhibits the longitudinal elongation . since we are dealing with phantom jets that show imperceptible evidence for jet in the events triggered by @xmath0 , all that have been seen in @xmath1 ( and presumably will be seen in @xmath57 ) are in the ridge .",
    "the basic difference between the ridge and the background is that for the former we have new parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the enhanced thermal partons , while for the latter @xmath105 and @xmath102 are given in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "there is also a @xmath1 dependence which is forced to vanish at @xmath106 due to the subtraction procedure used in the data analysis .",
    "we write @xmath107 , \\label{23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are discussed below .",
    "since associated particles in the ridge are unidentified charged hadrons , just as in the background , we obtain by thermal recombination as done in the preceding section @xmath110 where the last term is as calculated in eq .",
    "( 18 ) , given in ( 22 ) , but supplemented by @xmath111 oscillation and therefore behaves as in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath104 for the enhanced thermal source may be inferred from either @xmath101 or the value of @xmath112 mev determined in @xcite .",
    "they are consistent with each other .",
    "we shall use @xmath113 gev .",
    "the width @xmath109 is fixed by the condition @xmath114 at @xmath115 ; it turns out to be around 3.6 .",
    "we do not know the normalization @xmath103 of the enhanced thermal partons . even if we did , the width of the ridge in @xmath57 is unknown , since no data exist . the normalization of the first term of eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) should depend on the width of that ridge . at this point",
    "the data on the @xmath1 distribution , being blind to the ridge in @xmath57 , are determined by integration over the range @xmath116 .",
    "thus there is no alternative but to fit the height of the peak in @xmath1 by adjusting the value of @xmath108 , on which @xmath117 depends sensitively because eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) gives the difference between two terms of comparable magnitudes .",
    "the data on @xmath117 are not the only data we must fit : ref .",
    "@xcite also shows the near - side yield for various trigger hadrons that all exhibit similar dependence on @xmath118 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath117 which involves integration over @xmath75 , the yield @xmath119 involves integration over @xmath1 instead .",
    "if we denote @xmath120 then the yield is @xmath121 .",
    "\\label{26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( 24 ) and ( 26 ) are , of course , interrelated , but they provide independent checks on @xmath108 and @xmath104 , since @xmath122 depends on the range of @xmath118 , while @xmath123 depends on the range of @xmath1 .",
    "we show in figs .  1 and 2 the results of our calculation for two values of @xmath108 :",
    "@xmath124 the corresponding values of @xmath109 are 3.5 and 3.7 , respectively . for less than 1% variation in @xmath108",
    "there is a 20% variation in the height of the ridge . in either case",
    "the agreement with data in the two figures is good , given the fact that the data have large errors .",
    "since the process in which the energy loss by a hard parton is converted to the enhanced thermal energy of the medium is not calculable , especially since the energy and location of the originating phantom jet is unknown , the result that we have obtained is perhaps the most one can expect as a phenomenological explanation of why the @xmath0 trigger is accompanied by associated particles observable above the background .",
    "since our calculation of the @xmath1 distribution and the yield does not depend crucially on the exact nature of the trigger , it may be taken to explain why our calculated results are roughly in accord with the data not only for @xmath0 trigger , but also for @xmath25 and @xmath125 triggers , shown also in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "although the @xmath22 ratio for @xmath25 is not zero , being less than 0.1 would still imply that the ridge is dominant , so its associated particles would arise mainly from the ridge , with shower partons playing a minimal role .",
    "the case with @xmath125 trigger would be even closer to that of the @xmath0 trigger .",
    "assuming that the range of the ridge in @xmath57 is from @xmath54 to + 2 , as we have done in eq .",
    "( 24 ) in accordance to the present experimental cut , we can calculate the total number of charged particles in the ridge corresponding to an interval @xmath126 in the @xmath1 distribution n^r_i=_-i/2^i/2 d. [ 28 ] thus the predicted ridge height ( to be compared to the data after the removal of the background which includes the @xmath111 contribution ) is given by @xmath127 ,   \\label{29}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 .",
    "the predicted ridge heights for the two cases considered , for @xmath129 , are @xmath130 if the data on the ridge in @xmath57 turn out to have a width different from 4 , then the height will also be different accordingly .",
    "subject to that qualification , a height of 0.06 is our first - order prediction .",
    "it is of interest to note that the ridge height envisioned here is roughly the same as the one observed in @xcite for unidentified charged trigger with @xmath131 gev / c and associated particles in @xmath132 gev / c .",
    "we have presented a quantitative description of how the @xmath0 puzzle can be resolved .",
    "we have shown that the particles associated with @xmath0 can be understood as products of recombination of thermal partons in the ridge .",
    "although the non - perturbative dynamical process that leads to the formation of the ridge can not be calculated , there are aspects of the data that need coordinated explanation in a specific hadronization scheme .",
    "we have reproduced in figs .  1 and 2 both the @xmath1  and the @xmath133 dependence of the yield of the associated particles .",
    "one parameter @xmath108 is used to fit the height of @xmath117 , which depends on the exact value of @xmath108 so sensitively ( to within 1% in the margin of error ) that it is beyond the scope of any dynamical theory to predict .",
    "what we have learned from this phenomenological study is that the particles in the peak observed in the @xmath1  are all from the ridge , contrary to the usual identification of peaks with jets .",
    "phantom jets have no peaks .",
    "our finding implies that there should not be a peak in the @xmath57 , still to be produced by further analysis of the data .",
    "when that  becomes available and shows only a ridge , then our solution of the @xmath0 puzzle will finally be considered confirmed .    in the framework in which we have calculated the @xmath1   of the associated particles , it is implied that the  of the pions will have an inverse slope @xmath134 gev for @xmath135 gev / c and that the @xmath136 ratio will increase as @xmath137 in the same region for the same reasons as those found to explain similar phenomena related to non - strange triggers @xcite .",
    "while we have focused our attention in this paper on the @xmath0-triggered events , it is natural to predict that exactly the same features will be observed for the particles associated with the production of @xmath5 under the same conditions .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath0 are produced from the same enhanced thermal source , so their associated particles should both be formed from the ridges of similar characteristics .",
