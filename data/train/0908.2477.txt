    "dark energy is a popular explanation for the recent acceleration of our universe . in order to draw a portrait of the dark energy ,",
    "it is necessary to parameterize it and constrain the parameters from observational data . by the past and recent data analyses",
    ", it was indicated that the dark energy could have various steps in its parameters .",
    "several years ago , a late - time transition in the equation of state ( eos ) was studied by bassett _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "very recently , huang _ et al _",
    "@xcite reported that the dark energy might spring out at a low redshift .",
    "however , there were few theoretical studies to explain such steps in the eos or in the density of dark energy .",
    "our purpose here is to make a step toward this direction .",
    "we will treat the dark energy as a dynamical scalar field , and then study a step in the scalar potential , in the kinetic term , in the energy density and in the eos respectively .",
    "lacking of enough observational data , hitherto the portrait of dark energy is still vague and the hints of steps are weak , so we do not attempt to build a realistic model in this paper . instead , to give a vivid picture of the mechanism",
    ", we will play with simplified toy models and choose exaggerated model parameters . because these models are difficult to solve analytically , for the most time we will rely on numerical algorithms .",
    "the models and algorithms can be easily extended and refined to give a more realistic description of the dark energy .",
    "although this could be the first time to systematically study cosmic steps in dark energy models with explicit lagrangian , the stepped model is not novel in cosmology .",
    "it is an old story : possibly steps of the inflaton potential have left some fingerprints at the born time of our universe @xcite .",
    "since the dark energy is more elusive , the physical origin of the stepped dark energy field is less clear than the stepped inflaton field .",
    "before going to specific models , we will describe the general framework and numerical methods in some detail .",
    "impatient readers can skip directly to the next section to get our models ( [ stepv ] ) , ( [ stepf ] ) , ( [ potential ] ) and main results depicted in figures .    in the absence of spatial fluctuations ,",
    "the lagrangian density of a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity has the form @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the scale factor . here",
    "the function @xmath4 in the kinetic term is new .",
    "it is positive for quintessence @xcite and negative for phantom @xcite .",
    "later on we will also discuss a new model in which @xmath4 evolves dynamically from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "in that situation , the single real scalar plays the role of quintom @xcite .    in a flat universe dominated by dark energy together with",
    "cold dark matter , if we ignore the contribution of ordinary matter for simplicity , then the evolution dynamics is governed by the following friedmann equations @xmath7,\\\\ \\nonumber \\dot{h}&=&-4\\pi g_n(\\rho_{m}+\\rho+p)\\\\ \\label{friedmann2 } & = & -4\\pi g_n\\left[\\frac{\\rho_{m0}a_0 ^ 3}{a^3}+f(\\phi)\\dot{\\phi}^2\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the energy density of dark matter , taking value @xmath9 at the present time with the scale factor @xmath10 .",
    "the dark energy @xmath11 has an energy density @xmath12 and a pressure @xmath13 , whose subscripts have been left out for briefness .",
    "one should not mistake @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the total energy density and the total pressure .",
    "the eos parameter is defined by @xmath14 as usual .",
    "in the above we have used a dot to denote the derivative with respect to comoving ( physical ) time @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , we have taken the convention of notation @xmath16 and defined @xmath17 .",
    "it will be convenient to employ the notations @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then they give us a useful relation @xmath20 . utilizing ( [ friedmann1 ] )",
    ", we find the kinetic energy is @xmath21(1+z)^2\\phi_{,z}^2}{6 - 8\\pi g_nf(1+z)^2\\phi_{,z}^2}.\\ ] ]    the equation of motion @xmath22 for the scalar field can be written as @xmath23\\phi_{,z}\\\\ \\nonumber & = & 8\\pi g_nf(1+z)^2\\left[\\rho_{m0}(1+z)^3+v\\right]\\phi_{,zz}\\\\ \\nonumber & & + 16\\pi^2g_n^2f^2(1+z)^3\\left[\\rho_{m0}(1+z)^3 + 2v\\right]\\phi_{,z}^3\\\\ \\nonumber & & + 4\\pi g_nf_{,\\phi}(1+z)^2\\left[\\rho_{m0}(1+z)^3+v\\right]\\phi_{,z}^2\\\\ & & + v_{,\\phi}\\left[3 - 4\\pi g_nf(1+z)^2\\phi_{,z}^2\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given explicit form of @xmath4 and @xmath24 , equation ( [ eomz ] ) alone dictates the evolution of dark energy .",
    "but this is a highly nonlinear second order differential equation . in most cases we have to resort to numerical methods",
    ". we will take two slightly different schemes , dubbed the linear iteration method and the cubic iteration method , since they reform equation ( [ eomz ] ) into linear algebraic equations or cubic algebraic equations respectively .",
    "let us elaborate on them now .",
    "for numerically evolving equation ( [ eomz ] ) from an initial point @xmath25 to the final point @xmath26 , we partition the interval @xmath27 $ ] into @xmath28 equal subintervals of width @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient to notate @xmath30 for short , where @xmath31 . for numerical computation",
    ", the derivatives can be approximated by finite differences @xmath32 making use of approximations ( [ difference1 ] ) and ( [ difference2 ] ) , one can recast equation ( [ eomz ] ) into a linear algebraic equation with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "starting with the initial values of @xmath34 at @xmath35 , we can get the values of all @xmath34 with @xmath36 iteratively .",
    "the linear iteration method gives a unique path of @xmath11 for numerical evolutions .",
    "its disadvantage is the excessive number of initial conditions .",
    "remember that for a second order differential equation we usually impose two initial conditions . in practical operation",
    ", we treat with potentials flat at the initial point @xmath37 , and set @xmath38 .    rather than ( [ difference2 ] )",
    "one may tend to estimate the second order derivative with @xmath39 now we need only two initial conditions , for instance , @xmath40 .",
    "this is the starting point of the cubic iteration scheme .",
    "in such a scheme , instead of a linear equation of @xmath33 , one has to solve a cubic equation with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "the formula of roots of a cubic equation is well known . for our purpose , it is enough to treat them in two general categories : ( _ i _ ) if the equation has one real root and a pair of imaginary roots , then @xmath41 takes a value of the real root ; ( _ ii _ ) if all roots are real , we determine the value of @xmath41 by minimizing @xmath42 .",
    "the trick enables us to pick out the smoothest evolution path of @xmath11 , and fortunately this path is unique in our simulation . even if the path is not unique after applying the above trick , one can still find the smoothest path by further minimizing @xmath43 , _ etc_. the above two methods are operated independently in our algorithms . as double checks",
    ", they agree with each other very well .",
    "in fact , the resulting graphs look like duplicates . during the numerical simulation",
    ", we define the reduced planck mass @xmath44 , the fractional density of dark energy @xmath45 and the present fractional density of dark matter @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is hubble parameter at the present time . moreover , we set @xmath48 and work in the unit @xmath49 . in a flat universe ,",
    "ignoring the contribution of ordinary matter , one has @xmath50 . for every specific model below",
    ", we evolve equation ( [ eomz ] ) from @xmath51 to @xmath52 with @xmath53 subintervals . fixing the initial conditions and other parameters , if we increase either @xmath28 or @xmath25 , the change in results is unobservable .",
    "this confirms the reliability of our methods above and results below .",
    ") and @xmath54 . there are bumps in the curves of fractional density and eos parameter , although the bump in fractional density is almost unnoticeable",
    ". the amplitude and location of bumps can be tuned by changing parameters in our model .",
    "we set @xmath55 in all figures.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    ) and @xmath54 .",
    "both the kinetic energy and the potential are normalized by @xmath56 , where @xmath47 is the hubble parameter at @xmath57.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    ) and @xmath58 .",
    "the dark energy density climbs up a step , while eos parameter has a dip nearby .",
    "similarly to the stepped quintessence , the amplitude and location of the steps and dips are tunable as we change the model parameters.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    ) .",
    "in contrast with previous figures , a small change in parameter @xmath59 does not modify the evolution curves significantly.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +      so far we have not specified our models .",
    "it will be done in this section .",
    "firstly , suppose the potential of dark energy is broadly flat but has a sudden transition near @xmath60 .",
    "then it is natural to model such a stepped potential in the following form @xmath61.\\ ] ] for relatively small @xmath59 , the hyperbolic tangent function is a good smooth analytic approximation to a step function .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 determines the location of step in field space , while @xmath63 and @xmath59 control the height and width of step respectively .",
    "based on this model , more complicated ones can be obtained by superposing the steps or replacing the constant @xmath64 with other functions .",
    "note here @xmath63 is a dimensionless parameter , but @xmath62 and @xmath59 are in unit of reduced planck mass @xmath65 . however , in our simulation and figures , we will simply set @xmath49 .",
    "we study this potential in the context of quintessence with @xmath54 and phantom with @xmath58 respectively . since @xmath66 in a flat universe with negligible ordinary matter , it is easy to prove @xmath67 for quintessence ( lower sign ) and phantom ( upper sign ) .",
    "the simulation results for stepped quintessence are shown in figures [ fig - quintessence ] and [ fig - kinv ] .",
    "the results for phantom are depicted in figure [ fig - rhow ] . in plotting them",
    "we have chosen the step location @xmath68 , and the initial value of @xmath11 is chosen as @xmath69 at redshift @xmath70 . from the figures we can see a step in the energy density .",
    "quintessence falls down the step but phantom climbs up .",
    "although the location of step in field space is fixed by @xmath68 , its location in redshift space is dependent of @xmath63 and @xmath59 . at the same location",
    "there is a feature ( a bump for quintessence or a dip for phantom ) in curves of kinetic energy and eos parameter .",
    "amplitudes of steps and features are determined mainly by parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the initial value @xmath37 of the scalar field resides well in the flat region of the potential because @xmath71 .",
    "if we increase the absolute value of @xmath37 , the steps and features will shift to lower redshift region .    from figures [ fig - kinv ] and [ fig - rhow ]",
    ", one can roughly read the location @xmath72 and width @xmath73 of the step as well as the initial density @xmath74 and final density @xmath75 of the dark energy . in data analysis , it is useful to capture these properties by parameterizing the dark energy density as @xmath76 this parametrization is applicable when the dark energy changes from @xmath74 to @xmath75 near the redshift @xmath72 . assuming the dark energy is decoupled with other ingredients , we have the continuity equation @xmath77 or equivalently @xmath78 . corresponding to ( [ steprho ] )",
    ", it gives @xmath79\\left[\\rho_f+\\rho_i\\exp\\left(\\frac{z - z_t}{\\delta_t}\\right)\\right]}-1.\\ ] ] one may check that the function gives rise to a bump if @xmath80 or a dip when @xmath81 , in agreement with figures [ fig - quintessence ] and [ fig - rhow ] .",
    "having discussed the steps in the dark energy potential , we discuss what will happen if there is a step in the coefficient @xmath4 of the kinetic term .",
    "it is interesting to study a new model @xmath82.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in favor of the fact that @xmath66 , we can set @xmath83 .",
    "in the potential @xmath24 there is a deep dip , whose depth has been fixed .",
    "the coefficient @xmath4 is non - trivial .",
    "it has a step located at @xmath60 with amplitude @xmath63 and width @xmath59 .",
    "again @xmath63 is a dimensionless parameter , while @xmath62 and @xmath59 are in unit of reduced planck mass @xmath84 . as mentioned before , we set @xmath49 in our simulation and figures .",
    "the idea is to settle the potential bottom @xmath85 in the region @xmath86 by ensuring @xmath87 .",
    "given an appropriate initial condition , the scalar first rolls down to the bottom of potential and then moves up , getting closer and closer to the point @xmath60 .",
    "however , this model still requires some fine - tuning , because it is not always possible for the scalar field to pass the sign - inversion point of @xmath4 after leaving the bottom of potential .",
    "we fine - tune the parameters , and then numerically evolve the equation of motion ( [ eomz ] ) . according to the simulation results in figure [ fig - quintom ] , both the density and the eos parameter of dark energy decrease near the sign - inversion point .",
    "in particular , the eos parameter jumps down abruptly from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "this is a simple way to cross the eos barrier @xmath1 . to make it we need only one real scalar field , completely relying on its own dynamics",
    "however , one should not regard ( [ stepf ] ) as more than a toy model .",
    "there is an infamous instability in any model with a wrong - signed kinetic term , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the phantom model @xcite .",
    "we suspect the stepped quintom model here suffers from the same problem .",
    "various issues on this class of model were explored in @xcite .",
    "if there is a step in the eos parameter , one usually parameterizes @xmath0 in a form @xcite similar to ( [ steprho ] ) .",
    "however , for building a model later , we parameterize it in an alternative way , @xmath90 where @xmath91 . with this form , the continuity equation can be integrated out as @xmath92^{3(w_i - w_f)/\\lambda}\\\\ & = & \\rho_t\\left(\\frac{a_t}{a}\\right)^{3(1+w_f)}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{a_t}{a}\\right)^{\\lambda}\\right]^{3(w_i - w_f)/\\lambda}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note there is a duality @xmath93 , @xmath94 in ( [ stepw ] ) .",

    ". for details on reconstructing the potential of scalar dark energy , please refer to @xcite . making use of equations ( [ friedmann1 ] ) , ( [ friedmann2 ] ) , ( [ pressure ] ) and ( [ rho ] )",

    "we impose @xmath110 by hand to accomplish the sudden eos transition ( [ stepw ] ) .    ) with different parameter choices .",

    "treating dark energy as a scalar field , we explicitly modeled steps in its potential , kinetic term , density and eos , and thus provided a workable mechanism to explain the previously and recently claimed dark energy transitions . to arrive at a realistic model ,",
