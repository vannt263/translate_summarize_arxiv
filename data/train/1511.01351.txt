    "the symmetries play important role in varies branches of theoretical physics , both in classical and modern areas .",
    "for example , in the classical mechanics , the kepler problem is easily solved if one unified the conservation of energy , angular momentum which are the results of the symmetry of the kepler problem . even without solving the problem ,",
    "the conservation of the angular momentum will tell one many information , like the motion of the planet in the sun system being of plane , etc . in the paper",
    ", we will exploit the symmetry method to study the generalized kuramoto system and give the answer to the question of cluster synchrony state without solving the problem directly .",
    "the kuramoto model ( km ) captures the main property of the collective synchronization with the first harmonic coupling as @xmath0 and revealed the second continuous transition at the critical coupling strength @xmath1 .",
    "km is applied in many physical , biological and social systems , including electrochemical oscillators , josephson junction arrays , cardiac pacemaker cells , circadian rhythms in mammals , network structure and neural network@xcite-@xcite .",
    "km have been generalized in many aspects@xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of them is the introduction of the globally higher harmonic coupling @xmath2 , where many new and interesting phenomena appear , like the cluster synchronization ( cs ) , and switching of the oscillators between different clusters with the external force , etc.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "higher harmonic coupling ( hhc ) is dominating in @xmath3-josephson junction @xcite , in the electrochemical oscillators in higher voltage@xcite , in neuronal networks with learning and network adaption@xcite-@xcite .",
    "cs is the most outstanding feature of this higher harmonic coupling kuramoto model(hhc - km ) .    here",
    "we will investigate hhc - km from the point of symmetry , and provide a group transformation , and give cs a thoroughly novel interpretation , and answer the question on the same threshold for cs in different parameters @xmath4 .",
    "the generalized kuramoto model with the higher harmonic coupling is @xmath5 in the case of small strength @xmath6 , the term @xmath7 dominates the change of the phase @xmath8 and the whole phase system is in the incoherent state . whenever @xmath9 exceeds @xmath1 , the second terms in eq.([kuramoto mth ] )",
    "predominate and cs emerges@xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been also known that cs is sensitive to the initial conditions of the oscillators in ref.@xcite .",
    "we study cs from completely new view .",
    "we will try to find the relation between the generalized and standard kuramoto models , and penetrate the phenomena of cs to study their essence . in the standard kuramoto model",
    "@xmath10 the coupling strength @xmath11 is assumed . by introduction of the transformation @xmath12 together with @xmath13 chang into @xmath14 , eq.([kuramoto mth ] ) takes the form @xmath15 which is the same as that of the standard kuramoto model case in the fast study model . ] .",
    "the transformation ( [ trans ] ) is crucial to obtain the information on eq.([kuramoto mth ] ) and give the explanation to cs . for eq.([kuramoto 1-nth ] ) , the density function @xmath16 in the large @xmath17 limit satisfies the continuous equations @xmath18=0,\\label{f for trans}\\\\ & & r=\\int \\int   f(\\phi,\\omega , t)e^{i\\phi}d\\phi d\\omega.\\label{f for order}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] generally , the dynamical information for cs is obtained through solve eqs.([f for trans])-([f for order ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the transformation ( [ trans ] ) make it possible to alternatively investigate cs without assorting to the direct solutions to eqs.([f for trans])-([f for order ] ) .",
    "see details in the following .",
    "suppose initially uniform distribution in @xmath19 for the phases @xmath20 , the transformation indicates the corresponding initial phases uniform distribution is in @xmath21 for the phases @xmath22 . because eq.([f for trans ] ) is periodic in @xmath3 , with the initial periodic condition in @xmath3 ,",
    "the solution @xmath16 is also periodic in @xmath3 .",
    "so one has @xmath23 which results in the following outstanding properties for the corresponding density function @xmath24 @xmath25 hence the cluster phenomenons appear , and the phases @xmath20 cluster into @xmath4 sections . from eq.([symmetry in theta ] ) , it is easy to see that the order parameter is zero no matter the phases @xmath20 are in cs state or not , that is , @xmath26 so , the order parameter no longer works in the generalized one , as is shown in fig.[fig1 ] for the cases of @xmath27 and is substituted by the generalized order parameter @xmath28 defined as @xmath29 eq.([symmetry in theta ] ) guarantees the generalized order parameters @xmath28 being the same for all parameters @xmath4 , which also could be obtained from the fact of the same density function @xmath16 for different @xmath4 in calculation @xmath30 by eq.([f for order ] ) .",
    "we also numerically calculate @xmath28 against @xmath9 forwardly for different @xmath31 with the same initial random distributions in @xmath19 and the numerical results confirm the conclusion .",
    "see the second panel in fig.[fig1 ] for detail .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "cs has been investigated by the method of self - consistent approach in refs.@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "neural network actually studied the combination of the first and second harmonic couplings in the generalized kuramoto model@xcite-@xcite , which is also treated in ref.@xcite , @xcite . in the @xmath17",
    "identical oscillatorscase , the symmetry viewpoint is applied and cs of the two groups of @xmath4 and @xmath32 oscillators is connected with their symmetry groups of the dynamics @xmath33 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath34 is only suited for the identical oscillators in the kuramoto model .",
    "however , it is still very difficult to obtain clear analytical results by the self - consistent approach and detailed understanding of cs @xcite .    in the nice work @xcite ,",
    "cs have been investigated by the self - consistent approach .",
    "the density function for the second harmonic coupling case is decomposed into the symmetric and asymmetric parts in ref.@xcite , and the ott - antonsen ( oa ) mechanism is utilized to analyze the symmetric case . however , the asymmetric one is not accessible to the analytical study , and numerical methods are needed to the full solution of the density function @xcite . for higher harmonic coupling",
    "than the second , the density function @xmath35 is decomposed in to @xmath4 parts as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "oa mechanism could be utilized for @xmath38 and the critical strength @xmath39 is obtained for the the lorentz s distribution of the natural frequency @xmath40 .",
    "however , it is not easy to obtain other @xmath41 and numerical methods are used for @xmath24@xcite .    however , our study is completely different from that in ref.@xcite .",
    "we mainly rely on the transformation ( [ trans ] ) and the periodic properties of the density function to study the most typical phenomena cs in the generalized kuramoto model . by the transformation ( [ trans ] )",
    ", it is possible to relate cs with the periodic properties of the density function @xmath42 or @xmath35 . to hold the periodic properties for @xmath35",
    ", the initial distribution of the oscillators in terms of @xmath43 must range randomly in @xmath19 .",
    "because of the periodic properties of @xmath42 or @xmath35 and the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath3 , the @xmath4 cluster synchrony states appear corresponding to @xmath44 , which are in one of the sections @xmath45 for @xmath46 . corresponding the cluster sections ,",
    "there naturally exist boundaries for them , which function as the potential barriers to forbid the synchrony oscillators to pass through .",
    "the existence of the barrier - like boundary can also explain the sensitiveness of cs to the initial conditions .",
    "the initial distribution of the phases @xmath44 in @xmath47 with @xmath48 will break the periodic condition for @xmath42 or @xmath35 and the violation will result in the sensitiveness of cs to the initial distribution ( 0,a ) .",
    "the explanation to cs in the letter is novel and simple , and has both the profound mathematical insight and clear physical understanding .",
    "our detailed numerical studies confirm the symmetric analysis .",
