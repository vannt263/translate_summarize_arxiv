    "in this contribution i discuss the possibility of production of high energy cosmic neutrinos ( @xmath0 gev ) in cores of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) originating from proton acceleration , the effects of three flavour neutrino mixing on these high energy cosmic neutrino fluxes and the prospects for their observations in new km@xmath1 surface area underwater / ice neutrino telescopes .",
    "in addition to agns , high energy cosmic neutrinos may also be produced in several currently envisaged other cosmologically distant astrophysical sources .",
    "these sources may include , for instance , gamma ray burst fireballs and topological defects @xcite .",
    "for some possible effects of neutrino mixing other than the flavour one on high energy cosmic neutrino fluxes , see @xcite .",
    "the present study is particularly useful as several high energy neutrino telescopes are now at their rather advanced stage of development and deployment @xcite .",
    "i start in section 2 with a brief description of possibility of production of high energy cosmic neutrinos and discuss in some detail the effects of three flavour neutrino mixing on their subsequent propagation and further discuss the prospects for their detection . in section 3 ,",
    "i summarize the results .",
    "high energy cosmic neutrinos may mainly be produced either in @xmath2 or in @xmath3 collisions in a cosmologically distant environment .    in @xmath2 collisions ,",
    "high energy @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mainly produced through @xmath6 ( typically with @xmath7 ) .",
    "the same collisions will give rise to a greatly suppressed high energy @xmath8 flux ( @xmath9 ) mainly through @xmath10 .",
    "in @xmath11 collisions , the @xmath8 flux may be obtained through @xmath12 . the relatively small cross - section for @xmath13 production together with the low branching ratio into @xmath8 implies that the @xmath8 flux in @xmath11 collisions is also suppressed up to 5 orders of magnitude relative to @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 fluxes ( which are mainly produced through @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "matter effects on vacuum neutrino oscillations are relevant if @xmath15 . using @xmath16 from ref .",
    "@xcite as an example , it turns out that matter effects are absent for @xmath17 ev@xmath1 .",
    "matter effects are not expected to be important in the neutrino production regions around agn and will not be further discuss here .    in the framework of three flavour analysis , the flavour precession probability from @xmath18 to @xmath19 neutrino flavour is @xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the 3@xmath243 mns mixing matrix and can be obtained in usual notation through @xmath25 thus coinciding with the standard form given by the particle data group @xcite . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the distance between the source and the detector . for simplicity ,",
    "i assume here a vanishing value for cp violating phase @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath23 .    at present",
    ", the atmospheric muon and solar electron neutrino deficits can be explained with oscillations among three active neutrinos @xcite . for this , typically , @xmath31 ev@xmath1 and @xmath32 for the explanation of atmospheric muon neutrino deficit , whereas for the explanation of solar electron neutrino deficit , we may have @xmath33 ev@xmath1 and @xmath32 [ just so ] or @xmath34 ev@xmath1 and @xmath35 [ sma ( msw ) ] or @xmath34 ev@xmath1 and",
    "@xmath32 [ lma ( msw ) ] . the present status of data thus permits multiple oscillation solutions to solar neutrino deficit .",
    "i intend to discuss here implications of these mixings for high energy cosmic neutrino propagation .    in the above explanations ,",
    "the total range of @xmath36 is @xmath37 ev@xmath38 irrespective of neutrino flavour .",
    "the typical energy span relevant for possible flavour identification for high energy cosmic neutrinos is @xmath39gev@xmath40 in which currently the neutrino flux from cores of agns dominate .",
    "taking a typical distance between the agn and our galaxy as @xmath41 mpc ( where 1 pc @xmath42 m ) , note that @xmath43 term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) vanishes and",
    "so eq . ( 1 ) reduces to    @xmath44    it is assumed here that no relatively dense objects exist between the agn and the earth so as to effect significantly this oscillations pattern .",
    "note also that since @xmath45 in above eq . is symmetric under the exchange of indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 implying that no @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) violation effects arise in neutrino vacuum flavour oscillations for high energy cosmic neutrinos @xcite .",
    "let me denote by @xmath48 , the intrinsic neutrino fluxes . from the discussion in the previous subsection",
    ", it follows that @xmath49 . for simplicity ,",
    "i take these ratios as 1 : 2 : 0 . in order to estimate the final ( downward going ) flux ratios of high energy cosmic neutrinos reaching on earth ,",
    "let me introduce a 3@xmath243 matrix of vacuum flavour precession probabilities such that    @xmath50    where the unitarity conditions for @xmath51 read as    @xmath52    the explicit form for the matrix @xmath53 in case of just so flavour oscillations as solution to solar neutrino problem along with the solution to atmospheric neutrino deficit in terms of @xmath5 to @xmath8 oscillations with maximal mixing is    @xmath54    using eq .",
    "( 6 ) and eq .",
    "( 4 ) , it follows that @xmath55 at the level of @xmath56 .",
    "also , eq . ( 5 ) is satisfied .",
    "the same flux ratio is obtained in the remaining two cases for which the corresponding @xmath57 matrics are : [ for sma ( msw ) ]    @xmath58    whereas in case of lma ( msw ) ,    @xmath59    thus , essentially independent of the oscillation solutions for solar neutrino problem , it follows that @xmath60 .",
    "the deviations from these ratios are estimated to be small @xcite .    summarizing ,",
    "although intrinsically the downward going high energy cosmic tau neutrino flux is negligibally small however because of vacuum flavour oscillations it becomes comparable to @xmath4 flux thus providing some prospects for its possible detection .",
    "i briefly mention here the prospects for detection of downward going high energy cosmic tau neutrinos through double shower technique @xcite . for prospects of observations of high energy cosmic tau neutrinos other than double shower technique , see @xcite ,",
    "whereas for possibility of detection of non tau neutrinos , see @xcite .    the downward",
    "going tau neutrinos reaching close to the surface of the detector may undergo a charged current deep inelastic scattering with nuclei inside / near the detector and produce a tau lepton in addition to a hadronic shower .",
    "= 3.5 in = 2.4 in    this tau lepton traverses a distance , on average proportional to its energy , before it decays back into a tau neutrino and a second shower most often induced by decay hadrons .",
    "the second shower is expected to carry about twice as much energy as the first and such double shower signals are commonly referred to as a double bangs . as tau leptons are not expected to have further relevant interactions ( with high energy loss ) in their decay timescale , the two showers should be separated by a clean @xmath61-like track .",
    "the calculation of downward going contained but separable double shower event rate can be carried out by replacing the muon range expression with the tau range expression and then subtracting it from the linear size of a typical high energy neutrino telescope in the event rate formula while using the expected @xmath8 flux spectrum given by eq .",
    "this ensures that the two separate showers are contained within km of the underwater / ice detector .",
    "here , i restrict myself by mentioning that the expected number of contained but separable double showers induced by downward going high energy tau neutrinos for @xmath62 gev may be @xmath63/yr@xmath64sr irrespective of the oscillation solutions of solar neutrino problem , if one uses the @xmath56 from ref .",
    "@xcite as an example . at this energy ,",
    "the two showers initiated by the downward going high energy cosmic tau neutrinos are well separated ( @xmath65 70 m ) such that the size of the second shower is essentially 2 times the first shower and the two showers are connected by a @xmath66like track ( see fig .",
    "this identification , if empirically realized , may provide a possibility to isolate @xmath8 flavour from the rest of neutrino flavors .",
    "the chance of having double shower events induced by non tau neutrinos is negligibly small for relevant energies .",
    "intrinsically , the flux of high energy cosmic tau neutrinos is quite small , relative to non tau flavour neutrinos , typically being @xmath67 ( whereas @xmath68 ) from cosmologically distant astrophysical sources , namely , for instance , cores of active galactic nuclei .    \\2 . because of neutrino oscillations",
    ", this ratio can be greatly enhanced . in the context of three flavour neutrino mixing scheme which can accommodate the oscillation solutions to solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits in terms of oscillations between three active neutrinos , the final ratio of fluxes of downward going high energy cosmic neutrinos on earth is @xmath69 , essentially irrespective of the oscillation solutions to solar neutrino problem .",
    "this enhancement in high energy cosmic tau neutrino flux may lead to the possibility of its detection in km@xmath1 surface area high energy neutrino telescopes . for @xmath70/gev @xmath40 , the downward going high energy cosmic tau neutrinos may produce a double shower signature because of charged current deep inelastic scattering followed by a subsequent hadronic decay of the associated tau lepton .",
