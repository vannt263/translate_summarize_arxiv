    "in trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) , the extreme trans - neptunian objects or etnos are defined as asteroids with heliocentric semimajor axis greater than 150 au and perihelion greater than 30 au .",
    "there are at present 16 known etnos ( see tables [ helio ] and [ bary ] for relevant data ) ; they exhibit clustering in the values of their argument of perihelion ( trujillo & sheppard 2014 ) , longitude of the ascending node ( batygin & brown 2016 ) , eccentricity and inclination ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 , 2016 ) .",
    "the analysis in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014 ) has shown that the clustering in eccentricity ( @xmath1 about 0.81 ) can be due to a selection effect , but this can not be the case of the ones found in inclination ( @xmath2 about 20 ) , longitude of the ascending node ( @xmath3 about 134 ) , and argument of perihelion ( @xmath4 about @xmath526 ) .",
    "these patterns could be induced by the gravitational perturbation from one ( trujillo & sheppard 2014 ; gomes , soares & brasser 2015 ; batygin & brown 2016 ) or more ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 ; de la fuente marcos , de la fuente marcos & aarseth 2015 ) , yet to be discovered , trans - plutonian planets .",
    "malhotra , volk & wang ( 2016 ) have pointed out that the four etnos with the longest orbital periods ( see table [ bary ] ) have simple numerical relationships between periods .",
    "this implies that the etnos could be a highly structured , dynamically speaking , population .",
    "the etnos are not massive enough to induce orbit - orbit coupling by themselves , but a hypothetical planet or planets could be the source of these accidental commensurabilities .",
    "malhotra et al .",
    "( 2016 ) used their analysis to predict the existence of a planet with semimajor axis @xmath0665  au that is only marginally compatible with the one discussed by batygin & brown ( 2016 ) within the framework of their planet nine hypothesis ; even if their proposed value for the semimajor axis is similar , @xmath0665  au versus @xmath0700  au , the preferred values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in malhotra et al .",
    "( 2016 ) (@xmath6 ) or ( @xmath7) are rather different from those in batygin & brown ( 2016 ) (@xmath8 ) .",
    "accidental commensurabilities are a natural by - product of the existence of mean motion resonances in the solar system ( for the theory of orbital resonance , see e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "the orbital architecture of the main asteroid belt is mainly the result of interior mean motion resonances with jupiter ( see e.g. holman & murray 1996 ; nesvorn & morbidelli 1999 ) ; conversely , the one observed in the trans - neptunian belt is induced by exterior mean motion resonances with neptune ( see e.g. gladman et al .",
    "2012 ) . in the main asteroid belt ,",
    "the dominant ones are located at 2.06  au ( 4:1 ) , 2.5  au ( 3:1 ) , 2.82  au ( 5:2 ) , 2.95  au ( 7:3 ) and 3.27  au ( 2:1 ) ; therefore , any asteroids trapped in these resonances are also nominally resonant among themselves even if these objects are not massive enough to induce orbit - orbit coupling by themselves .",
    "for instance , the alinda asteroids which are subjected to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter and the griqua asteroids that occupy the 2:1 resonance are also in a mutual 3:2 near mean motion resonance . for objects trapped in the dominant resonances , the values of the ratios of orbital periods",
    "are : @xmath9 this sequence represents a characteristic sample of accidental commensurabilities in the main asteroid belt . in the trans - neptunian belt , the dominant mean motion resonances with neptune are located at 39.4  au ( 2:3 ) , 42.3  au ( 3:5 ) , 43.7  au ( 4:7 ) , 47.8  au ( 1:2 ) and 55.4  au ( 2:5 ) ; the associated ratios of orbital periods are : @xmath10 they define accidental commensurabilities beyond neptune . out of 10 values ,",
    "as many as five could be common to both sequences .",
    "the commensurability analysis carried out in malhotra et al .",
    "( 2016 ) provides some support for the planet nine hypothesis and singles out some resonant orbital relations , but it does not explore the subject of commensurabilities between etnos in depth . here",
    ", we use the seminal idea presented in malhotra et al .",
    "( 2016 ) and the fact that very eccentric orbits are affected by mean motion resonances no matter the value of the semimajor axis ( see e.g. gomes et al . 2005 ) to investigate this subject extensively .",
    "we use their heliocentric and barycentric semimajor axes , their uncertainties , and monte carlo techniques to find out if the values of the ratios of orbital periods of the etnos match those in the main and trans - neptunian belts .",
    "this letter is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 presents the data used in this study .",
    "our monte carlo methodology is explained and applied in section  3 .",
    "results are discussed in section  4 and conclusions are summarized in section  5 .",
    "ignoring the mass of the object , expressing distances in astronomical units , times in sidereal years , and masses in solar masses , kepler s third law applied to an object orbiting the sun states that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the period and @xmath13 is the semimajor axis of the orbit of the object . given two objects the first one with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the second one with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 kepler s third law is given by @xmath19 . if @xmath20 can be written in the form of a ratio of small integers then we have a mean motion resonance . in order to investigate the distribution of ratios of orbital periods , @xmath20 , for the etnos the values of the semimajor axes are needed .",
    "the orbital solutions of the etnos are far less robust than those available for the best studied members of the main asteroid belt or the trans - neptunian belt ; the values of the relative error in semimajor axis are several orders of magnitude larger in the case of the etnos .",
    "any study of commensurabilities between etnos must account for this fact ; a probabilistic approach based on the values of their uncertainties can be used to address this important issue .",
    "the values of the heliocentric semimajor axes and their uncertainties from the jet propulsion laboratory , jpl , small - body database and horizons on - line ephemeris system ( giorgini et al .",

    "however , the heliocentric orbital elements may not be adequate for this study as the objects discussed here are too distant from the sun . in cases like this one ,",

    "in this section we construct commensurability maps by generating pairs of virtual etnos from the data in tables [ helio ] and [ bary ] via monte carlo techniques ( metropolis & ulam 1949 ; press et al .",

    "when computers are used to produce a uniform random variable ( to seed the box - muller method ) it will inevitably have some inaccuracies because there is a lower bound on how close numbers can be to 0 . for a 64 bits computer",
    "the smallest non - zero number is @xmath31 which means that the box - muller method will not produce random variables more than 9.42 standard deviations from the mean ; however , unphysical values have not been used in the calculations .",
    "the number of pairs of virtual etnos tested per monte carlo experiment is @xmath32 .",
    "a random ( uniform ) distribution of semimajor axes should exhibit a degree of commensurability compatible with zero .",

    "the results appear in purple in figs [ commhelio ] and [ commbary ] .",
    "however , the etnos have been discovered from the ground and this fact induces a bias in the observed distribution of semimajor axes even if the etnos are not subjected to any external perturbation and just follow heliocentric , or barycentric , orbits . following the analysis in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014 ) and , in order to reproduce this bias , we generate ten sets of 16 values of the semimajor axis according to the distribution in the top panel of fig . 3 in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014 ) ;",

    "the analysis presented in the previous section shows that the frequency distribution of the ratio of orbital periods of known etnos is statistically incompatible with that of an unperturbed asteroid population following heliocentric / barycentric orbits .",
    "this result is unlikely to be a statistical artefact as the known etnos have been discovered by several independent surveys with , presumably , uncorrelated biases .",
    "if the frequency distribution of the ratio of periods is incompatible with an unperturbed scenario , how significant are the favoured commensurabilities ? in order to answer this rather critical question , we have computed the difference between the frequency obtained from the observational values and that from the biased expectation ( green curve in figs [ commhelio ] and [ commbary ] ) and divided by the value of the standard deviation in the biased case calculated as described above .",

    "[ sigma ] , we would like to downplay this issue as two objects have values of the semimajor axis of @xmath44  au and several others have semimajor axes close to 150  au .",
    "these two values are the abrupt cutoffs in the distribution of semimajor axes .     of the deviations of the frequency distribution in the heliocentric ( blue ) and barycentric ( red ) cases ( data from figs [ commhelio ] and [ commbary ] ) with respect to the biased expectations .",
    "the @xmath45 limits are also indicated . ]",
    "one of the most surprising properties of the sample studied is the unusually large fraction of objects with ratio of periods @xmath46 .",
    "this issue was already noticed in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014 ) . in particular ,",
    "the orbits of 2004  vn@xmath47 and 2013  rf@xmath23 are alike , and several objects have values of the barycentric semimajor axis within narrow ranges of each other .",
    "this could mean that some of these objects move co - orbital , i.e in a 1:1 mean motion resonance , with an unseen planet ( or , more likely , several of them ) .",
    "co - orbital motion is possible at high eccentricity ( namouni 1999 ; namouni , christou & murray 1999 ; namouni & murray 2000 ) .",
    "however , a more likely scenario is in the presence of higher order resonances like the 7:3 and 5:2 in the main asteroid belt that give a ratio of periods of 1.0699 or the 4:7 and 3:5 in the trans - neptunian belt that give a ratio of 1.0501 .",
    "interior and exterior resonances are possible if there are multiple trans - plutonian planets . regarding the impact of this resonant scenario on the planet nine hypothesis , it is clearly compatible with it .",
    "if the mechanisms responsible for inducing dynamical structure in the main and trans - neptunian belts are also at work in the region occupied by the etnos then we should expect that for two given etnos in near commensurability : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the semimajor axis of the orbit of the perturber and @xmath50 are all small integers .",
    "this expression can be applied to two of the most clear clusterings in semimajor axis in table [ bary ] .",
    "the average value of the barycentric semimajor axis of ( 90377 ) sedna and 2007 tg@xmath21 is 504  au . on the other hand ,",
    "the equivalent mean value for 2004 vn@xmath47 , 2010 gb@xmath22 and 2013  rf@xmath23 is 332  au .",
    "these five objects are part of the set of six singled out by batygin & brown ( 2016 ) .",
    "the associated period ratio for these two sets of etnos is 1.87 . in the main asteroid belt , this ratio is obtained for objects trapped in the 5:3 mean motion resonance with jupiter and those in the 3:1 , that is one of the main resonances in the outer belt ( holman & murray 1996 ) . making a dynamical analogy between the two situations and decomposing eqn .",
    "[ key ] in two we have : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the average of the two values of @xmath49 is @xmath0700  au which is the favoured value for the semimajor axis of planet nine in batygin & brown ( 2016 ) .",
    "the 1.8 commensurability has a statistical significance of 239@xmath53 for heliocentric orbits , the 1.89 commensurability has 51@xmath53 for barycentric orbits",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ sigma ] ) .",
    "this is unlikely to be mere coincidence .",
    "another example of the potential implications of our findings arises when we focus on 2003 hb@xmath54 , 2015 so@xmath55 , 2005 rh@xmath56 , ( 445473 ) 2010 vz@xmath23 and 2013  gp@xmath57 , the first two could be in a 3:2 resonance with a hypothetical planet at @xmath58  au , with the other three in a 5:3 resonance with the same planet . in this framework ,",
    "the pair 2003 hb@xmath54 and 2015 so@xmath55 would be in a 10:9 accidental resonance with the other three etnos .",
    "a ratio of periods @xmath59 is present in both the main asteroid belt and the trans - neptunian belt .",
    "the 1.1 commensurability has a statistical significance of 76@xmath53 for heliocentric orbits and",
    "61@xmath53 for barycentric orbits",

    "[ sigma ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the 1.65 commensurability is present for both heliocentric ( 192@xmath53 ) and barycentric ( 131@xmath53 ) orbits ; a similar analysis focusing on 2003 hb@xmath54 , 2013  gp@xmath57 , ( 82158 ) 2001 fp@xmath60 and 2002 gb@xmath61 is compatible with a hypothetical planet at @xmath62  au considering resonances ( 3/1)(5/9)=5/3@xmath01.66 . with the currently available data , degenerate solutions are possible , but they still hint at a multi - planet scenario .",
    "trans - plutonian planets may have been scattered out of the region of the giant planets early in the history of the solar system ( see e.g. bromley & kenyon 2014 , 2016 ) , but planets similar to uranus or neptune may also form at 125750 au from the sun ( kenyon & bromley 2015 , 2016 ) .",
    "in this letter , we have explored the existence of commensurabilities between the known etnos .",
    "this analysis has been inspired by the hypothesis and discussion presented in malhotra et al .",
    "given the fact that these objects are not massive enough to induce orbit - orbit coupling by themselves , the existence of statistically significant commensurabilities could only signal the presence of massive unseen perturbers .",
    "summarizing , our conclusions are as following .    * the clustering in orbital parameter space observed for the heliocentric orbits of the known etnos is also present when considering their barycentric orbits . in particular , @xmath1 clumps about 0.81@xmath630.06 ,",
    "@xmath2 about 20@xmath638 , @xmath3 about 134@xmath6372 , and @xmath4 about @xmath526@xmath6349 .",
    "statistical outliers do exist . *",
    "the frequency distribution of the ratio of orbital periods of known etnos is statistically incompatible with that of an unperturbed asteroid population following heliocentric / barycentric orbits .",
    "in contrast , it resembles the ones present in the main and trans - neptunian belts .",
    "the existence of statistically significant accidental commensurabilities between etnos strongly suggests that external perturbers induce the observed dynamical structure .",
    "* the fraction of known etnos in 1:1 commensurabilities is dozens of times the expected value for a random population . * a number of known etnos may be trapped in the 5:3 and 3:1 mean motion resonances with a putative planet nine with semimajor axis @xmath0700  au .    we must stress that our results are based on small number statistics , but it is also true that the deviations from what is expected for an unperturbed asteroid population following heliocentric / barycentric orbits are so strong that what is observed is unlikely to be the result of chance alone . gravitational perturbations with sources in the region travelled by the etnos are the most probable explanation for the observed patterns .",
