    "nowadays , weather forecasts are usually based on the output of numerical weather prediction ( nwp ) models which describe the dynamical and physical behavior of the atmosphere through nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "single deterministic predictions produced by single runs of such models fail to account for uncertainties in the initial conditions and the numerical model",
    ". therefore , nwp models are nowadays typically run several times with varying initial conditions and model physics , resulting in an ensemble of forecasts , see @xcite and @xcite for reviews .",
    "examples of ensemble prediction systems ( epss ) are the 51-member european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) ensemble @xcite , the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble ( uwme ; * ? ? ?",

    "the transition from single deterministic forecasts to ensemble predictions can be seen as an important step towards probabilistic forecasting , however , ensemble forecasts are often underdispersive and subject to systematic bias .",
    "they thus require some form of statistical post - processing .    over the past decade , various post - processing methods have been proposed in the meteorological literature . in the bayesian model averaging ( bma ;",
    "* ) approach the forecast distribution is given by a weighted mixture of parametric densities , each of which depends on a single ensemble member with mixture weights being determined by the performance of the ensemble member in the training period . within this article",
    "we build on the conceptually simpler ensemble model output statistics ( emos ) approach proposed by @xcite , where the conditional distribution of the weather variable of interest given the ensemble predictions is modeled by a single parametric family .",
    "the parameters of the forecast distribution are connected to the ensemble forecast through suitable link functions .",
    "for example , the original emos approach models temperature with a gaussian predictive distribution where the mean is an affine function of the ensemble forecasts , and the variance is an affine function of the ensemble variance .    over the last years",
    "the emos approach has been extended to other weather variables such as wind speed @xcite , precipitation @xcite , and total cloud cover @xcite .",
    "the success of statistical post - processing relies on finding ( and estimating ) appropriate parametric families for the weather variable of interest . however , the choice of a suitable parametric model is a non - trivial task and often a multitude of competing models is available .",
    "the relative performance of these models usually varies for different data sets and applications .",
    "the restriction to a single parametric family further limits the flexibility of the model .",
    "therefore , regime - switching combination and mixture model approaches have been proposed recently . in the regime - switching combination approach",
    "@xcite one of several candidate models is selected based on covariate information , whereas the mixture model approach of @xcite relies on jointly estimating the parameters and weight of a weighted mixture of two forecast distributions . however , the applicability of the regime - switching combination method is limited by the availability of suitable covariates , and the estimation of the mixture model is computationally demanding .    in this article",
    "we therefore propose a general , computationally efficient approach for combining forecast distributions from post - processing models .",
    "the proposed method is a two - step procedure where in a first step , the individual emos models based on single parametric distributions are estimated . in a second step the forecast distributions from the individual models",
    "are combined as a weighted mixture , where the optimal mixture weight is determined in a single step , usually involving numerical integration .",

    "successful statistical post - processing of ensemble forecasts relies on finding ( and estimating ) appropriate parametric models for the conditional distribution of the weather variable of interest given the ensemble predictions . in case of the emos approach ,",
    "the forecast distribution is given by a single parametric distribution with parameters depending on the ensemble forecast .",
    "while temperature can be modelled by a normal distribution where the mean and variance are affine functions of the ensemble predictions and ensemble variance , respectively @xcite , the choice of a suitable parametric family is much less straightforward for weather variables such as wind speed or precipitation . a multitude of post - processing models and modeling strategies has been proposed over the last years . in the following short review ,",
    "we focus on emos models for wind speed and precipitation , and subsequently propose a novel approach to combine forecast distributions from different models .",
    "non - negative weather variables such as wind speed require skewed predictive distributions with non - negative support such as weibull @xcite or gamma distributions @xcite .",

    "examples include the 51-member ecmwf ensemble , as well as multi - model epss such as the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble @xcite or the glameps ensemble @xcite , which consist of several groups of exchangeable members . to account for the generation of the forecasts , ensemble members within a given group of exchangeable members",

    "as an alternative to the tn emos model , @xcite introduce an emos approach based on log - normal forecast distributions where the mean  @xmath18  and variance  @xmath19  of the predictive distribution are linked to the ensemble members as @xmath20 obviously , these quantities uniquely determine the location  @xmath1  and shape  @xmath2  of the underlying ln distribution  @xmath21  with pdf @xmath22 via transformations @xmath23 similar to the tn emos model , estimates of parameters  @xmath24  and  @xmath25 are obtained by optimizing the mean of an appropriate verification score over all forecast cases in the training data .",
    "the tn and ln models described above model the conditional distribution of wind speed given the ensemble predictions with a single parametric forecast distribution .",
    "this approach relies on the choice of a suitable parametric family , and limits the flexibility of the model .",
    "for instance , it can be demonstrated that the heavier tails of the ln model are more appropriate for modeling higher wind speeds in the right tail of the distribution , whereas the tn model is more appropriate for the bulk of the distribution , see @xcite for details .",
    "therefore , different combination and mixture models have been proposed in the literature . in the regime - switching combination approach",
    "@xcite one of the candidate models is selected based on covariate information with suitably adapted parameter estimation procedures .",
    "for example , a tn model can be used if the median ensemble forecast is below a threshold @xmath26 and an ln model is used in case of median ensemble forecasts exceeding this threshold .",
    "such combination models have been demonstrated to improve the predictive performance compared to the individual models , however , they require the choice of a suitable covariate , and the threshold parameter @xmath27 has to be determined by repeating the model estimation over a grid of potential values , thereby limiting the flexibility and increasing the computational cost of such approaches .    in order to flexibly combine the advantages of lighter and heavier - tailed distributions and to avoid these problems in the process , @xcite propose a mixture model of the form @xmath28 where the parameters of the component distributions depend on the ensemble forecasts as specified in and .",
    "the emos coefficients and the weight  @xmath29 $ ]  of the mixture model are estimated jointly using optimum score estimation approaches .",
    "this mixture model approach results in significantly improved calibration @xcite , however , it is computationally very demanding and does not allow for using standard optimum score estimation based on the continuous ranked probability score due to the lack of an analytic expression of the objective function , see section [ subs3.3 ] for details .",
    "compared to the joint estimation of all parameters in , the forecast combination approaches introduced in sections [ subs3.4 ] and [ subs3.5 ] are two - step procedures where in a first step , emos models based on a single parametric family are estimated , and in a second step , these models are combined as a weighted mixture by estimating an appropriate weight . in section  [ sec : sec4 ] the full mixture model is used as a benchmark , whereas the regime - switching combination approach will not be considered any further .",
    "the special discrete - continuous nature of precipitation requires a non - negative predictive distribution assigning positive mass to the event of zero precipitation .",
    "a popular choice is to consider a continuous distribution that can take both positive and negative values and left censor it at zero @xcite , which thereby assigns the mass of negative values to zero precipitation accumulation .",
    "let  @xmath30  denote the cdf of the  @xmath31  distribution with shape  @xmath32  and scale  @xmath33  and let  @xmath34 .",

    "however , joint optimum score estimation of the parameters is even more involved than in the case of the tn - ln mixture model for wind speed due to the larger number of parameters and the discrete - continuous nature of the forecast distribution  @xmath62 as initial tests with the precipitation data sets introduced in section [ sec : sec2 ] indicated problematic behavior of the numerical optimization algorithms potentially caused by the non - smooth dependence of the objective functions on the parameters , we do not pursue this approach any further and only consider the two - step forecast combination approaches introduced in sections [ subs3.4 ] and [ subs3.5 ] .      in probabilistic forecasting",
    "the general aim is to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distribution subject to calibration @xcite .",
    "calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the forecast and the observation , and given that the predictive distribution is calibrated , it should be as concentrated ( or sharp ) as possible .",
    "calibration and sharpness can be assessed simultaneously with the help of proper scoring rules .",
    "proper scoring rules are loss functions that assign a numerical value to pairs of forecasts and observations . in atmospheric sciences",
    "the most popular scoring rules are the continuous ranked probability score ( crps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the logarithmic score ( logs ; * ? ? ?",
    "given a predictive cdf  @xmath63  and an observation  @xmath64 ,  the crps is defined as @xmath65 where  @xmath66  and  @xmath67  are independent random variables with cdf @xmath68  and finite first moment . the last representation in implies that the crps can be expressed in the same unit as the observation . the logarithmic score is the negative logarithm of the predictive density  @xmath69  evaluated at the verifying observation , i.e. , @xmath70 both crps and logs are proper scoring rules @xcite which are negatively oriented , that is , smaller scores indicate better forecasts .",
    "proper scoring rules provide valuable tools for the estimation of model parameters .",
    "following the general optimum score estimation approach of @xcite , the parameters of a predictive distribution can be determined by optimizing the average value of a proper scoring rule as a function of the parameters over a suitably chosen training set .",
    "optimum score estimation based on minimizing the logs then corresponds to classical maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation .",
    "if closed form expressions of the integral in are available , minimum crps estimation , i.e. optimum score estimation based on minimizing the mean crps , often provides a valuable , more robust alternative to ml estimation . in recent applications to statistical post - processing of ensemble forecasts , minimum crps estimation has been demonstrated to lead to slightly better predictive performance , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "analytic expressions of the crps are available for all individual emos models for wind speed and precipitation introduced in sections [ subs3.1 ] and [ subs3.2 ] , thereby allowing for efficient parameter estimation procedures by minimizing the mean crps over the forecast cases in the training periods .",
    "the closed form solutions are provided in the corresponding articles @xcite .",
    "implementations for the statistical programming language ` r ` @xcite are for example available in the ` scoringrules ` package @xcite .",
    "the parameter estimation for the emos models is performed using the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bfgs ) algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 10.9 ) implemented in the ` optim ` function in ` r ` . in the case of precipitation",
    "we use a constrained version of the bfgs algorithm to ensure positivity of the emos coefficients . see section [ sec : sec4 ] for details on the selection of the training sets over which",
    "the parameters are estimated .",
    "by contrast , the crps is not available in closed form for the mixture models and , so each step of the optimization procedure based on minimizing the crps requires a numerical integration resulting in very high computational costs . therefore , we do not consider minimum crps estimation for these mixture models and use ml estimation of the parameters instead . in case of the mixture model for wind speed , this approach leads to similar predictive performance compared to minimum crps estimation , see @xcite for details .",
    "however , the analogous mixture model for precipitation can not be successfully estimated , as both the bfgs and the more robust @xcite algorithm encounter numerical issues , do not converge , or fail to give reasonable parameter estimates .",
    "potential reasons for these problems include the large dimensions of the optimization problem , the non - smooth character of the likelihood function , as well as the challenging discrete - continuous nature of the predictive distribution .",
    "we propose a computationally efficient two - step procedure for estimating the parameters of mixture models consisting of two different families of distributions .",
    "the first step is given by the estimation of component models in the form of emos models based on suitable single parametric families . in a second step ,",
    "the component models are combined by estimating the mixture weight .",
    "compared to the previously discussed mixture model , this two - step approach is computationally much more efficient as it reduces the dimensionality of the optimization problems .",

    "obviously , gives no guarantee that for a new out - of - sample pair  @xmath93  the crps of the mixture  @xmath94  does not exceed any of the corresponding individual crps values .",
    "however , in the case studies presented in section [ sec : sec4 ] the mixture models show significant improvements in predictive performance compared to the models based on single parametric families .",
    "compared to the mixture model approach for wind speed proposed by @xcite discussed in section [ subs3.1 ] , the new two - step method displays similar predictive performance , but significantly reduces the computational costs .",
    "the above method can be generalized to a convex combination of  @xmath95  different parametric families .",
    "however , in this case the optimal weight vector is a coordinate - wise non - negative solution of a quadratic optimization problem with a single linear constraint , where the main diagonal of the corresponding  @xmath96  symmetric matrix consists of the mean crps values of the component models , whereas the other entries , which are similar to  @xmath97 ,  can be expressed via integrals .",
    "following the lead of @xcite , we introduce linear pooling and spread - adjusted linear pooling of predictive distributions as a benchmark approach to forecast combination for statistical post - processing . given two predictive distributions  @xmath71  and  @xmath72 ,  with notation as in section [ subs3.4 ] , the forecast distribution of the spread - adjusted linear pool ( slp ) combined predictive distribution @xcite with spread adjustment parameter  @xmath98 takes the form @xmath99.\\ ] ] the traditional linear pool ( lp ) is obtained for  @xmath100 as demonstrated by @xcite , linear pooling of predictive distributions increases the dispersion of the forecasts , whereas the slp approach allows to correct for this deficiency .",

    "as initial tests indicated improvements in the predictive performance , we further employ the traditional linear pool by fixing  @xmath105  and selecting the optimal weight @xmath103 as described above .",
    "the lp and the combination approach described in section [ subs3.4 ] therefore differ in the way the weights @xmath106 are determined . while the weights in the combination approach are computed as minimum point of  @xmath84  and require only a single numerical integration step to obtain  @xmath97 ,  the lp approach requires repeated numerical integrations to obtain crps values for all possible choices of the weight parameter and thus it is computationally more demanding .",
    "the slp combination formula can be further generalized by allowing for different spread adjustment parameters in the components @xcite , however , this leads to even higher computational costs and is not feasible for the data sets investigated here .",
    "here , we report the results of four case studies for the wind speed and precipitation data sets introduced in section [ sec : sec2 ] .      the calibration of the raw ensemble and the post - processed forecasts can be assessed graphically with the help of verification rank and probability integral transform ( pit ) histograms , respectively .",
    "the former is the histogram of ranks of the validating observations with respect to the corresponding ensemble predictions computed for all forecast cases ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "apart from the visual inspection of pit histograms , formal statistical test of uniformity of the pit values can be used to assess calibration . here",
    "we apply the classical kolmogorov - smirnov test , however , alternative tests that account for the complex dependence structures in pit values of sequential k - step - ahead forecasts have been proposed in the econometric literature , see @xcite and references therein for details .    numerical measures of calibration and sharpness are provided by coverage and width of prediction intervals .",
    "the coverage of an  @xmath107 central prediction interval is the proportion of validating observations located between the lower and upper  @xmath108 quantiles of the predictive distribution and should be around  @xmath109  for a calibrated forecast distribution .",
    "sharper predictive distributions correspond to narrower prediction intervals . choosing  @xmath109  to match the nominal coverage of the ensemble allows to directly compare the calibration of the raw ensemble and the post - processed forecast distributions . due to the discrete - continuous nature of forecast distributions , in the case of precipitation",

    "figure [ fig6 ] further graphically illustrates the distribution of the computation times of the different post - processing approaches .",
    "it can be observed that the novel two - step combination approach only requires relatively small additional computation time compared to the estimation of the individual component models , whereas both the full mixture model for wind speed and the lp combination models require clearly more computational resources .",
    "however , all computation times reported here are generally much lower compared to the computational costs of generating the ensemble forecasts .",
    "we have proposed a novel , computationally efficient approach to combining forecast distributions from individual post - processing models .",
    "the proposed method is a two - step procedure , where in a first step individual emos models based on single parametric distributions are estimated .",
    "given the model estimates , the forecast distributions are then combined in the form of a weighted mixture , where the weight is determined in a single numerical integration step .    in four case studies",
    "the proposed combination approach outperforms the individual component models and shows similar predictive performance compared to the standard linear pool and to a full mixture model for wind speed .",
    "however , the computational costs are significantly lower and , given the availability of suitable component models , the proposed methodology can be applied to any weather variable of interest .",
    "therefore , it is also useful for quantities such as precipitation , where full mixture models can not be estimated successfully .",
    "applications of the proposed combination method to further weather variables such as total cloud cover @xcite might be an interesting starting point for future research .",
    "generally , the proposed methodology could be extended to more than two mixture components , however , the computational costs will increase with number of mixture components due to the larger number of required numerical integration steps .",
    "regarding the relative predictive performance of the different forecast combination methods in the case studies , the slp approach generally performs worse than the proposed two - step approach and it is rarely able to outperform the individual component models .",
    "by contrast , it showed promising results in @xcite , where , however , the combined forecast distributions exhibited very different and complementary calibration properties with overdispersive forecast from one model , and underdispersive forecasts from the other one , which is not the case in any of our case studies .",
    "other forecast combination approaches have been proposed in the literature including for example the beta - transformed linear pool @xcite or bayesian generalizations thereof @xcite .",
    "these combination approaches provide an interesting starting point for future research , however , their applicability might be limited by high computational costs .",
    "further , an alternative approach to combining forecast distributions is given by using suitably weighted proper scoring rules that emphasize certain regions of interest .",
    "thereby , the forecast combination weight can be determined by which of the competing distributions performs better for certain region of interest , see @xcite for details .    an entirely different approach to post - processing that completely circumvents the problem of choosing suitable parametric forecast distributions is the use of non - parametric methods ,",
    "see for example @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches suffer from the limitation that the support of the forecast distribution is necessarily restricted to the range of observed values in the training sets .",
    "further , these methods require sufficiently long training periods , and generally lead to high computational costs .",
