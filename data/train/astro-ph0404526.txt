    "the fact that light rays can wind an arbitrary number of times around a black hole before emerging back towards spatial infinity is well known since early times of general relativity @xcite ( see e.g. the treatment in @xcite ) . in practice , a source behind a black hole not only produces the two classical weak field gravitational lensing images , but also an infinite number of strong field images corresponding to photons with winding numbers running from 1 to infinity .",
    "this phenomenon has been revived in a work by @xcite , who showed that the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy may be a suitable lens candidate .",
    "the resolution needed for such observation is very high but should be reached by next future very long baseline interferometry experiments , such as arise and maxim . in order to describe gravitational lensing in such extreme cases , we can not use any weak field approximation .",
    "however , it is possible to take advantage of the opposite limit and finally get a very simple and efficient analytical approximation , called the strong field limit ( sfl ) @xcite .",
    "this method , firstly emerged in schwarzschild black hole studies @xcite , was then applied to reissner - nordstrom black holes @xcite , to charged black holes of heterotic string theory @xcite and finally generalized to an arbitrary spherically symmetric metric @xcite .",
    "the microlensing situation was considered by @xcite , while the kerr black hole was explored analytically for quasi - equatorial motion @xcite and numerically for arbitrary motion @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that a time delay measurement would give a precise estimate of the distance of the lens @xcite . for former and/or alternative formulations of strong field gravitational lensing see @xcite .    already in the first studies of gravitational lensing in strong fields by @xcite",
    ", it was noticed that the whole sky is mapped in the vicinity of what it was then called a `` compact sun '' .",
    "in particular , it was known that a source in front of the lens could yield relativistic images and einstein rings as bright as a source behind the lens ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in more recent years",
    "retro - lensing was re - discovered quite independently from standard gravitational lensing .",
    "@xcite proposed that a black hole of a few solar masses passing within 1 pc from the solar system would redirect photons from the sun backwards to the earth .",
    "an observer would thus see a `` star '' lighting up and then switching off in the sky as the earth in its motion enters and leaves the best alignment position .",
    "@xcite suggested the black hole in sgr a * at the center of our galaxy as a suitable retro - lens , proposing the star s2 ( the star with the smallest average distance from sgr a * discovered so far ) as a candidate source . at the moment , this seems to be the best known candidate for gravitational lensing in strong fields , deserving a closest investigation . at the same time , @xcite considered retro - lensing by sgr a * , using the analytical framework of the sfl method to give correct estimates for such a phenomenon ; their investigation , however , is limited to small angles and can not cover the case of s2 .",
    "finally , @xcite extended holz & wheeler proposal to kerr retro - lensing , using the sfl method to calculate the position of the images but using the holz & wheeler formula for the amplification ( which is inadequate for spinning black holes ) , finding no significant deviation from the light curves of the schwarzschild case .    in this paper",
    ", we give up any limitation due to small - angle approximation and treat the standard and retro - gravitational lensing on a unified ground , where they just come up as particular cases . besides recovering these two situations",
    ", we also address the gravitational lensing problem for any intermediate geometries , where the strong field images are still present as always , but they are usually dimmer ( see sect .",
    "2 ) . this allows us to treat in a very accurate way the case of the star s2 , giving sharp predictions for the light curves of its images in the next years .",
    "moreover , we clarify several aspects which were not clearly stated in the former literature , constructing a unique analytical framework for the whole phenomenology .    in sect .",
    "2 we treat the spherically symmetric lens ; we give the formulae for the position and the magnification of the images , and discuss the differences with the magnification formula by @xcite ; we also comment on the importance of time delay measurements .",
    "3 is devoted to the study of s2 , the best candidate source for gravitational lensing in the sfl ; we use our formalism to draw analytical curves of the images , accurately predicting the epoch of their luminosity peak . in sect .",
    "4 , in the light of the results by @xcite , we guess about the possible changes in s2 relativistic images if the black hole at the center of our galaxy has non - vanishing spin ; we also compare our results in sun retro - lensing by kerr black holes with those by @xcite . sect .",
    "5 contains a summary of the work .",
    "according to the sfl method , the deflection angle of a light ray passing very close to a black hole can be expanded around the minimum impact angle @xmath0 , which separates the light rays absorbed by the black hole ( @xmath1 ) from the light rays which are simply deflected ( @xmath2 ) . as previously shown @xcite ,",
    "the deflection angle always diverges logarithmically at @xmath3 for any class of spherically symmetric black holes .",
    "the logarithmic term and the constant term give a sufficient approximation to the deflection angle in order to explain the whole phenomenology .",
    "the fundamental formula reads    @xmath4    up to higher order terms in @xmath5 .",
    "the numerical coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 depend on the characteristics of the black hole ( electric charge , coupling to a scalar field , the particular gravitation theory we are using , etc . ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for its full derivation and for some examples ( see also @xcite ) .    using the formula ( [ sfl ] ) ,",
    "@xcite have correctly calculated the position and the magnification of the retro - lensing images .",
    "however , their treatment ( as well as the treatment in @xcite for standard lensing ) is limited to small separations of the source from the optical axis ( defined as the line connecting the observer with the lens ) . in order to address the general case",
    ", we have to write the lens equation in a suitable way , without restricting to particular cases .",
    "the source , the lens and the observer define the plane where the whole motion of the photon takes place in the case of spherically symmetric black holes .",
    "we define @xmath8 as the angle between the source - lens direction and the optical axis ( see fig . [ fig lens eq ] ) .",
    "@xmath9 is the angular position of the image in the sky of the observer , with respect to the position of the black hole .",
    "it coincides with the impact angle of the light ray as seen by the observer .",
    "the impact angle as seen from the source is called @xmath10 .",
    "then the lens equation is simply ( see also @xcite ) @xmath11 now , we can give a unique treatment allowing @xmath8 to run over the whole range @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , @xmath13 would yield the weak field gravitational lensing ; @xmath14 would be gravitational retro - lensing ; @xmath15 would give standard gravitational lensing in the sfl and so on .",
    "the collection of strong field gravitational lensing images would be recovered solving the lens equation for @xmath16 with @xmath17 , while the collection of retro - lensing images is recovered with @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "since we are only interested in strong field gravitational lensing of far sources , the impact angle @xmath20 is always negligible compared to @xmath8 and @xmath21 , since it is of the order of the schwarzschild radius of the black hole divided by the distance of the lens which is usually much larger ( unless we are falling into the black hole ! ) .",
    "so we can safely drop @xmath9 from eq .",
    "( [ lens eq ] ) .",
    "for @xmath10 we can apply the same argument as long as the source is far enough from the black hole ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite for the more complicated case where the source is orbiting very close to the black hole ) .",
    "the general solution of the lens equation is then @xmath22 this formula is valid both for standard gravitational lensing ( when @xmath23 , compare with @xcite ) and for retro - lensing ( when @xmath24 , compare with @xcite ) .",
    "it is also valid for any intermediate situation .",
    "its limits of validity are fixed by the accuracy of the sfl formula ( [ sfl ] ) for the deflection angle when we slip from strong field to weak field gravitational lensing .",
    "this point deserves a deeper discussion .",
    "estimates of the accuracy of the sfl approximation are easily done in the schwarzschild case , where it is possible to calculate the deflection angle exactly @xcite .",
    "so let us call @xmath25 the exact deflection angle for schwarzschild black hole .",
    "let @xmath26 be the image calculated using @xmath27 in the lens equation ( [ lens eq ] ) .",
    "what is really interesting in the images is their difference from the minimum impact angle , i.e. @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "so , in fig . [ fig acc ] , we finally plot @xmath30 vs @xmath8 .",
    "of course when @xmath13 we should rather use the weak field approximation and the error becomes very large ( we should also take into account the fact that the additional terms in the lens equation are no longer negligible ) . what is more interesting is looking at the error in the determination of the retro - lensing images ( @xmath14 ) , which turns to be of the order of @xmath31 .",
    "the accuracy grows exponentially with @xmath8 so that the outermost relativistic image of standard strong field gravitational lensing ( @xmath32 ) is determined with an accuracy of @xmath33 . to improve these numbers , which is perhaps desirable for the outermost retro - lensing image , higher order terms in the formula for the deflection angle should be included , but this task is beyond the scope of this work",
    ". a @xmath31 accuracy in retro - lensing will be sufficient for most of the following discussions .      in the first retro - lensing paper @xcite a rather unusual formula for the amplification of the images",
    "was proposed , based on heuristic arguments @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the inner and outer impact parameters which bound the image , @xmath37 is the amplitude of the arc described by the image , @xmath38 is the source radius .    according to this formula ,",
    "a full einstein ring would form only for a perfect alignment @xmath39 .",
    "this is obviously wrong , since it is sufficient that just one point of the source is perfectly aligned to build a full einstein ring . for a source",
    "far enough from perfect alignment , it can be shown that this approximate formula coincides with the standard formula we are going to derive in this subsection .",
    "however , it can not be trusted in the high alignment regime and should be replaced by a more rigorous one .",
    "@xcite already derived a formula valid for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "here we rederive it for an arbitrary black hole . to describe the extension of the source in terms of our angles , we can attach polar coordinates to the lens frame , where @xmath8 plays the role of the polar angle from the optical axis and we introduce an azimuthal angle @xmath40 around this axis .",
    "then the solid angle element is given by @xmath41 . in the same way",
    ", we can attach polar coordinates to the observer obtaining an image element @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 represents the ratio between the angular extension of the image as it appears to the observer and the extension of the source as it appears to the black hole .",
    "the latter is related to the extension of the source as it appears to the observer by the simple quadratic ratio of the distances @xmath44 .",
    "finally we have @xmath45    the source distance is of course related to the other distances by simple trigonometry : @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , since we are always considering black holes far from the observer , we can safely approximate @xmath47 . on the other hand , only for a high alignment situation , with @xmath48 , we can replace @xmath49 by @xmath50 .",
    "in such cases , which correspond to standard and retro - lensing , we recover the usual formula for the magnification of spherically symmetric lenses , valid for small angles .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , on the contrary , is valid also for a general @xmath8 .",
    "now , using the lens equation , we can write @xmath51 where the sign coming out of the derivative correctly accounts for the parity of the image . for @xmath23",
    "we recover the magnification formula given by @xcite , while for @xmath52 we recover the formula given by @xcite .",
    "however , this formula smoothly joins the two extreme cases , covering the whole range of @xmath8 . it can be obtained from the kerr magnification formula given by @xcite in the limit of vanishing black hole spin .",
    "however , the derivation proposed here does not need to pass through the kerr metric and can be applied to a generic spherically symmetric black hole .",
    "the caustic points ( points of formally infinite magnification ) are exactly at @xmath53 where @xmath49 vanishes .",
    "sources close to these points get the maximal amplification .",
    "that is why standard and retro - lensing were first studied as the most interesting physical cases .    to treat extended sources we need to integrate this formula over the angular extension of the source , eventually weighted by a surface brightness factor .",
    "if the source is far from a caustic point , then the magnification varies very little along the source surface and it makes almost no difference to approximate the source as a point . on the contrary , the magnification for point - like sources diverges on caustic points , while for realistic extended sources we get a finite result integrating over the source angular area .",
    "then the source radius acts as an effective cut - off of the magnification .    in order to compare this formula with that of @xcite",
    ", we can use it in the limit of retro - lensing , with @xmath54 .",
    "the magnification becomes latexmath:[\\[\\mu_{retro}=-\\frac{d_{os}^2}{d_{ls}^2 } \\frac{\\theta_m^2 e^{\\frac{\\overline{b}- \\pi}{\\overline{a}}}(1 + e^{\\frac{\\overline{b}- \\pi}{\\overline{a}}})}{\\overline{a }    @xmath8 in the exponentials being much weaker than the dependence in the denominator .    finally , the integral over the source extension , for a constant brightness source of radius @xmath38 is a standard calculation in terms of elliptic functions , first performed by @xcite , and also given explicitly by @xcite",
    ". it amounts to replacing the @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ mur ] ) by its integral over the source disk @xmath57 @xmath58}{\\pi \\gamma_s^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left [ ( \\gamma_s-\\gamma )   e\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},-\\frac{4\\gamma_s \\gamma}{(\\gamma_s-\\gamma)^2 } \\right)+\\right .",

    "( \\gamma_s+\\gamma)f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},-\\frac{4\\gamma_s \\gamma}{(\\gamma_s-\\gamma)^2 } \\right ) \\right],\\label{intmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for simplicity we have used @xmath8 instead of @xmath59 and we have defined @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 are the elliptic integrals of first and second kind .    with this formula",
    ", we can draw a retro - macho light curve for the situation described by @xcite , i.e. a black hole of 10 m@xmath63 passing at 0.01 pc from the sun , which deviates photons coming from the sun backwards to the earth .",
    "we can compare the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig micro ] with those by @xcite to see how different the shape looks when the source starts to cover the caustic point ( top curve ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the absolute normalization of the curves by @xcite is slightly different from that by @xcite and both are slightly different from ours .",
    "this might depend on minor approximations in the units of measure .",
    "in the case of perfect alignment , eq .",
    "( [ intmu ] ) gives @xmath64 .",
    "the maximum amplification is thus @xmath65 where we have also multiplied by two in order to sum the ( equal ) magnifications of the two images . in sun retro - lensing",
    ", it amounts to @xmath66    now , let us consider an arbitrary geometry , where observer , source and lens are completely misaligned , so that @xmath8 is far from @xmath67 .",
    "then we have to use the general formula ( [ mu ] ) for the magnification with a value for @xmath49 which is a generic number between 0 and 1 .",
    "to compare this situation with the perfect alignment , we can take the ratio between eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) with @xmath68 and one half of eq .",
    "( [ mumax ] ) ( for a single image ) . apart from the exponentials , which can weakly modify the order of magnitude",
    ", this ratio is generally of the order of @xmath69    thus intermediate lensing is generally disfavored with respect to standard and retro- gravitational lensing .",
    "however , this does not mean that intermediate lensing can not be interesting from an observational point of view , as we shall see in sect .",
    "3 .      time delay in strong field gravitational lensing provides a very important independent observable , which directly yields the distance of the lens with a good accuracy @xcite .",
    "in fact the time delay between images with successive winding numbers is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the speed of light .",
    "thus , measuring @xmath0 and @xmath72 we can immediately obtain @xmath73 .",
    "to get an idea of how big the time delay is , we can write it as @xmath74    it is thus completely insignificant for solar mass black holes , even if they are close to our solar system .",
    "it is also quite small for the black hole at the center of our galaxy , but it amounts to several days for supermassive black holes in other galaxies , being thus measurable , once we find a suitable variable source .    the calculations by @xcite were made with the standard gravitational lensing configuration in mind .",
    "however , it is easy to see that in retro - lensing or any intermediate lensing configurations the time difference between relativistic images remains exactly the same , while only the ( unobservable ) absolute travel time of the photon changes .",
    "now let us consider the time delay between the first relativistic image and the direct image of the source .",
    "when the source is well aligned behind the lens , then the direct image becomes weakly lensed and the first relativistic image turns to the secondary weak field image . in this case",
    ", the shapiro time delay formula applies ( see @xcite for an application involving the galactic center ) .",
    "if the source is not behind the lens , then the time delay between the first relativistic image and the direct image is dominated by the geometric path difference @xmath75 \\simeq \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\simeq \\frac{d_{ol}}{c_0 } \\frac{1-\\cos{\\gamma}}{\\sin{\\gamma}}\\beta , \\label{tdsf - wf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the angular separation between the source and the black hole as seen by the observer .",
    "the last approximate equality is valid if @xmath77 . in principle , measuring @xmath76 and @xmath72 , if we have a good knowledge of @xmath8 , we can use the time delay to estimate the distance to the lens . with respect to the time delay between consecutive relativistic images ,",
    "this measure is surely easier , since we just need one relativistic image .",
    "however , we need a good knowledge of the angle @xmath8 , which was not required in the previous case .",
    "s2 is the star with the minimum average distance from the galactic center discovered so far @xcite .",
    "its orbital motion has been very accurately reconstructed through proper motion and spectral measurements .",
    "its orbital parameters , taken by @xcite are reported in table 1 .",
    "this star looks like a o8-b0 main sequence star of 15 m@xmath63 with an apparent magnitude in the k - band ( centered on @xmath78 m ) of @xmath79 .",
    "the extinction in the k band in the region of the galactic center amounts to 3.3 magnitudes @xcite . the orbital period and the major semiaxis fix the enclosed mass to @xmath80 , slightly larger than the central black hole mass , which is currently estimated to @xmath81 .",
    ".orbital parameters for s2 .",
    "@xmath82 is the major semiaxis , @xmath83 is the orbital period , @xmath84 is the eccentricity , @xmath85 is the epoch of periapse , @xmath86 is the inclination of the normal of the orbit with respect to the line of sight , @xmath87 is the position angle of the ascending node , @xmath88 is the periapse anomaly with respect to the ascending node .",
    "data taken from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the value of the inclination of the orbit suggests that a high alignment with the observer - lens line does not occur during the motion of the star around sgr a*. this seems to rule out any possibility for standard or retro - gravitational lensing .",
    "contrarily to what expected , @xcite claimed that the relativistic images of s2 in the central black hole are not far beyond instrumental sensitivities , even if the alignment is not favorable . in this section",
    ", we complete their analysis in the light of our formalism , including all the significant orbital parameters and drawing light curves for the relativistic images using our magnification formula .",
    "we can thus confirm their claim also predicting the best observability time for these images .    rather than a retro - lensing configuration",
    ", s2 represents a case with an intermediate @xmath8 .",
    "the magnification of the images is thus well described by eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) . since the radius of s2 is a few solar radii",
    ", @xmath89 stays much smaller than @xmath50 ( i.e. we are far enough from caustic points ) , allowing us to trust the point - like magnification without need to integrate it over the source surface . after some algebra , we can write down all the interesting quantities in terms of the orbital parameters of the system @xmath90 , \\label{gammas2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the anomaly angle of the star starting from the periapse epoch , @xmath86 is the inclination of the orbit and @xmath88 is the periapse anomaly with respect to the ascending node . by the angular momentum conservation",

    "if the eccentricity of the orbit of s2 were negligible , @xmath95 would just be a linear function of time , of the form @xmath96 , with @xmath97 being a constant .",
    "this approximation was done for simplicity by @xcite .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig phi ] , we see that the high value of the eccentricity drastically modifies this function . to get accurate predictions , it is thus mandatory to take into account the angular motion of s2 correctly .    finally , we can plot the magnification of the first two relativistic images , taking @xmath81 as the mass of the black hole @xcite ( @xcite used @xmath98 ) .",
    "the first relativistic image has @xmath99 . in practice",
    "it is the secondary image of weak field gravitational lensing which turns into a strong field image because of the high misalignment .",
    "it has a negative parity and is formed close to the black hole on the other side with respect to the direction of s2 .",
    "the second relativstic image has @xmath100 and comes from light rays which take the `` wrong '' direction around the black hole , and are bound to turn once more around it in order to reach the observer .",
    "this image has positive parity and appears on the same side of s2 .",
    "the next images are fainter and probably uninteresting for the moment .    in fig .",
    "[ fig s2mu ] we plot the magnifications of the first two images as functions of time .",
    "the periapse epoch is the most favorable for the observations since @xmath101 , which appears with a power of -2 in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , drops to its minimum value .",
    "this minimum value is still 1300 times larger than the schwarzschild radius of the central black hole , so that we can safely treat the source as far from the lens .",
    "since the angular velocity of s2 is maximal in the periapse epoch , the luminosity peak is relatively short . as s2 passed through the periapse in year 2002",
    ", we have to wait for the next periapse to get this luminosity peak . in fig .",
    "[ fig s2ing ] , we have drawn the expected apparent magnitudes in the k band of the two first relativistic images at the epoch of the next periapse , supposing that the extinction value 3.3 in this band @xcite also applies from light coming to us from regions very close to the central black hole .",
    "the first relativistic image should stay brighter than 32 magnitudes from mid - august 2017 to mid - april 2018 .",
    "the second relativistic image is typically 5.4 times fainter during the peak .",
    "a hard challenge for next generation instruments !",
    "the observation of a relativistic image requires a strikingly high angular resolution together with a high flux sensitivity .",
    "very impressive improvements in very long baseline interferometry have been performed in the last years in the radio bands . with the first detection of transatlantic fringes at 147 ghz @xcite ,",
    "the present world record has been established at 18 microarceseconds , which is just few times the angular size of the schwarzschild radius of the black hole at the galactic center .",
    "further improvements can be obtained at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "a very important step for absolute sensitivity in the infrared band is the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) , which will operate in the wavelength interval @xmath102 . at @xmath103 , with a 3 hours exposure , it will be able to detect a flux corresponding to 32 magnitudes , just enough to catch the first s2 relativistic image .",
    "if coupled with other instruments still to come , then the detection of relativistic images would become a next future observational frontier .",
    "furthermore , we can not forget that the galactic center is surrounded by a crowded clusters of stars , which can probably yield even better candidates than s2 for strong field gravitational lensing .",
    "we close this section with some comments on possible time delay measurements .",
    "since s2 is close to the center of galaxy , but never aligned behind it , we can estimate the time delay between the first relativistic image and the direct image using eq .",
    "( [ tdsf - wf ] ) . at the luminosity peak epoch",
    ", this delay amounts to 5.95 hours , thus being comparable to the exposure time . in the particular case of s2 , no intrinsic variability has been reported up to now in the observed spectral bands .",
    "however , the principle of time delay measures could be applied to eventual new candidates or to s2 itself if any variability is detected in its flux .",
    "a measure of such a short time delay , requires a very good sampling over the whole period of variability .",
    "the precision of such estimate is limited by the effort undertaken to sample the two light curves to be compared . with a good knowledge of the orbit ( in order to correctly estimate @xmath8 ) and a sufficient sampling , which would depend on the future facilities and the characteristics of the source",
    ", it could be possible to establish the distance to the center of the galaxy on a solid direct measurement .",
    "what we have said up to now is true for spherically symmetric black holes ( including the estimates on s2 gravitational lensing ) . in the case of spinning black holes",
    ", everything becomes much more complicated , but some very important facts already emerge from the analysis of quasi - equatorial motion , which has already been done analytically @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is evident that the caustics are no longer aligned along the optical axis , but drift following the sense of rotation of the black hole .",
    "in addition , they are no longer point - like , but acquire finite extension . to get an idea of the importance of these changes , we can see that for @xmath104 the first retro - lensing caustic drifts from the optical axis by an angle of @xmath105 and acquires an extension of @xmath106 on the equatorial plane .",
    "the existence of extended caustics is accompanied by the formation of pairs of additional images when the source enters one of the caustics .",
    "these images are missed in the quasi - equatorial approach since they rather live far from the equatorial plane .",
    "a very important consequence is the fact that high magnifications can be attained much more easily .",
    "in fact , while in spherically symmetric metrics the caustics are point - like and coincide with the optical axis , in the kerr metric they are distributed in all directions around the lens and have finite extension , so that it is much easier for a source to lie within a high amplification region for some relativistic images .",
    "another complication comes because the usual hierarchy among relativistic images , which just follows the winding number , can be completely upset by the fact that the source lies in a caustic affecting images with higher winding number .    summing up",
    ", the kerr black hole lensing is much richer than spherically symmetric black hole lensing .",
    "it is also much more promising from a phenomenological point of view , since it is easier to have brighter images . and",
    "of course it is reasonable to expect that astrophysical black holes are born with a non - negligible spin .",
    "all these statements point to the importance of the investigation of the kerr black hole lensing in the general case .      as a practical example of the modifications that an eventual spin of the black hole in sgr a * would have on the light curve of the images of s2 , let us calculate the magnification at the moments when s2 crosses the plane of the galaxy .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that if the central black hole is spinning , its equatorial plane is very close to the rotation plane of the galaxy .",
    "using the orbital parameters of s2 , we see that it has crossed the galactic plane in @xmath107 , where it had @xmath108 and @xmath109 , being east of the black hole , slightly behind it .",
    "it will cross again the galactic plane in @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , being west of the black hole , slightly before it . for these crossing times",
    ", we can precisely calculate the magnifications of the equatorial images using the formula by @xcite    @xmath113    where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the phase of the photon oscillations on the equatorial plane , expressed by @xmath118    the coefficients @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath119 are all functions of the spin of the black hole @xmath82 , ( see @xcite for the whole derivation ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig kerr ] , we plot the magnifications of the images as a function of the black hole spin , from @xmath120 ( schwarzschild ) to @xmath121 ( extremal kerr black hole in our normalization ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig kerr]a and [ fig kerr]b , we plot the image magnifications for the past time @xmath122 , while in fig .",
    "[ fig kerr]c and [ fig kerr]d we plot the image magnifications for the future time @xmath123 . in the left figures we plot the magnifications of the images with negative parity .",
    "the brightest of them gives the most significant contribution ( it is this image that is going to be most likely observable )",
    ". the magnifications of the images with increasing winding number are plotted altogether .",
    "the higher the winding number , the lower the magnification . on the right figures",
    "we represent the magnification of the positive parity images .",
    "the most relevant of these was also represented in figs .",
    "[ fig s2mu ] and [ fig s2ing ] , where it was however fainter than the brightest negative parity image . increasing the winding number ,",
    "the magnification falls down .",
    "the images in figs .",
    "[ fig kerr]a and [ fig kerr]d are formed by retrograde photons , i.e. winding oppositely to the sense of rotation of the black hole .",
    "the images in figs .",
    "[ fig kerr]b and [ fig kerr]c are formed by co - rotating photons .",
    "now let us comment on the outcome of these figures .",
    "increasing the spin of the black hole , we see that co - rotating images become brighter and retrograde images become fainter .",
    "the most striking features are the peaks in the magnification that occur at definite values of the black hole spin . varying the black hole spin , the caustic points drift all around the trigonometric interval and for some values they meet the angular position of s2 . around these values ,",
    "the magnification can become significantly higher than the normal value .",
    "we also see that the first caustics , corresponding to low winding numbers , move slowly and thus cross the position of s2 less times .",
    "the caustics corresponding to higher winding numbers move quickly . for this reason",
    "the fainter images meet caustics more often in the interval of variability of @xmath82 .",
    "if the true value of the spin of the central black hole is such that one of the images is close to a caustic point , that image will be highly amplified . by these plots",
    ", we see that in year 2018.00 , for the particular value @xmath124 the second negative parity image will overcome the brighter one .",
    "besides the luminosity of the relativistic images , the presence of a spin for the black hole also affects their position .",
    "in fact , image formed by retrograde photons appear farther from the central black hole up to 1.5 times , while co - rotating photons appear closer to it up to 2.6 times .",
    "finally , it must be kept in mind that since the caustics have extended areas , these caustic points are actually just the cusps of these caustics .",
    "this means that the images we are plotting in fig .",
    "[ fig kerr ] change their parity at every caustic crossing .",
    "global parity conservation is assured by creation or destruction of non equatorial images of the same parity of the image before the crossing . for these images",
    "we do not have an analytical treatment at the moment and all we can say is that they will appear at each caustic crossing and disappear when the source steps out of a caustic .    when a complete analytical treatment of the kerr black hole lensing is available , not only we will have a clearer idea of the dynamics of all images , but we will be able to use the whole information about position and luminosity of all visible relativistic images to measure the spin of the black hole .",
    "we can imagine that such an estimate would be much cleaner and simpler than those relying on poorly understood models of the accretion disk or gas surrounding the central black hole , which are subject to very complicated physical processes and dynamics .",
    "however , for the details of such a fascinating measure , we still have to wait for further analytical progresses on the general kerr lensing .",
    "another context where kerr black hole lensing was discussed was retro - lensing of the sun by a nearby kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "as a first step , it was considered a geometry such that the whole event occurred within the equatorial plane of the black hole . using the formulae by @xcite ,",
    "the positions of the images were correctly calculated . however , the magnification was estimated using the formula by @xcite , which was derived for a schwarzschild black hole ( being also inaccurate for central events as shown in sect .",
    "it is well known in different contexts @xcite that the modification to the magnification map come firstly from the change to the jacobian function , due to the change in the lens model , and only secondly from the displacements of the image positions due to the modifications in the lens equation , which can be neglected in a first extent . as a consequence of this simplification @xcite found no significant deviation from schwarzschild retro - lensing . however , by the study of the equatorial case , we learn that the caustics drift and acquire finite extension , so that we expect that things are not so simple .    for the configuration considered in @xcite and @xcite , we have strong magnification only if the source is close to a caustic .",
    "very small misalignments can already kill the images to very small luminosities ( it is sufficient to take a look at fig .",
    "[ fig micro ] to get convinced ; for quantitative estimates see @xcite ) .",
    "so , it is sufficient that the relevant caustic for retro - lensing moves out of the earth orbit in order that the possibility of sun retro - lensing disappears at all . with a black hole at distance 0.01 pc",
    ", this happens if the black hole spin is @xmath125 : quite a small value .",
    "if we have a black hole with a spin less than this , then the retro - lensing caustic area would be much smaller then the sun angular radius as seen from the black hole , being effectively treatable as point - like .",
    "then everything would work more or less like in the schwarzschild case , with corrections to the magnification curves of the order of @xmath126 , i.e. below the precision of sfl approximation .",
    "gravitational lensing in strong fields is a very interesting subject from the theoretical point of view .",
    "potentially it is a very appealing phenomenon which is completely embedded within the full general relativity .",
    "it would thus be an exceptional probe for physics in the regions close to the event horizons of black holes and would give very important feedback on the correct theory of gravitation .",
    "this justifies the very strong efforts that have been done by several groups to find possible candidate sources and lenses which could make this fascinating phenomenon manifest .",
    "the astrophysical cases investigated up to now are such that the relativistic images should be `` almost '' observable or should become observable within not many years .",
    "the most important problem is whether these theoretical configurations are likely or not .",
    "the case of s2 , on the contrary , is a concrete case where definite predictions for the image luminosities can be done .    in this work",
    "we have extended the analytical framework of the strong field limit analysis to cover all the possible geometric configurations , giving up any small angle approximations which are not automatically encoded in the tracks of the light rays . in this way",
    ", we have been capable to revisit the so called retro - lensing , in particular the sun retro - lensing proposed by @xcite , with more valid mathematical instruments .",
    "moreover , we can adequately cover any intermediate case , such that of the star s2 @xcite .",
    "for the first relativistic image of this star , we predict an epoch of maximal luminosity ( better than 32 magnitudes ) between the end of year 2017 and the first part of 2018 .    using previous work on equatorial kerr lensing @xcite ,",
    "we have guessed how the presence of extended caustics and their drift from the optical axis can affect the brightness of the relativistic images of s2 at the epoch of its crossing through the galactic plane .",
    "we have also put upper limits on the black hole spin in kerr retro - lensing of the sun in order to have still significant images .    as a final remark",
    ", we can say that strong field gravitational lensing opens really fascinating perspectives , like testing the general relativity , measuring the distance , the spin or other physical parameters of the black hole in the galactic center and in the centers of other galaxies .",
    "the nice luminosity estimates for s2 encourage to look for more stars orbiting very close to the central black hole as new potential candidate sources for such an amazing phenomenon .",
    "we thank the cern theory department for hospitality .",
    "we also thank gaetano scarpetta for comments on the manuscript , francesco de paolis and achille nucita for useful discussions , and our referee for some nice suggestions ."
