    "synchrotron radiation emitted in our galaxy provides a diffuse radio background .",
    "small - scale structure in the linearly polarized component of this radio background provides unique information about the structure in the warm interstellar medium ( ism ) and the galactic halo on parsec scales and larger ( see discovery paper @xcite ) .    with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt )",
    "we mapped the polarized radio background in a 7@xmath0 field centered on @xmath1 , in five frequency bands ( 341 , 349 , 355 , 360 , and 375  mhz ) with a bandwidth of 5 mhz simultaneously , at a resolution of @xmath24@xmath3 .",
    "no total intensity @xmath4 was detected down to @xmath20.7  k , which is @xmath5 of the expected sky brightness in this region , indicating that @xmath4 does not vary on scales detectable to the interferometer , i.e.  below about a degree .",
    "however , linearly polarized intensity @xmath6 and polarization angle @xmath7 show abundant small - scale structure .",
    "there is a wide variety in topology of the structure in polarized intensity @xmath6 , on several scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "the typical brightness temperature @xmath8 6 - 8 k ( maximum @xmath215  k ) , and the maximum degree of polarization is @xmath230% , with an average of @xmath210% . in addition , a pattern of black narrow wiggly canals is visible ( see e.g.  the canal around ( ra ,  dec ) = ( 92.7 , 49 - 51)@xmath9 ) , caused by beam depolarization .",
    "these canals are all exactly one synthesized beam wide and have been shown to be borders between regions of fairly constant polarization angle @xmath7 where the difference in @xmath7 is approximately 90@xmath9 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) caused by abrupt changes in rotation measure ( rm ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the canals reflect specific features in the angle distribution . other angle ( and rm ) changes within the beam cause less or no depolarization , so that they do not leave easily visible traces in the polarized intensity distribution .",
    "seventeen polarized extragalactic sources were detected at a higher resolution ( @xmath21@xmath3 ) , with rm s from @xmath12 to 19.5 rad  m@xmath13 .",
    "[ fig1]b shows the rm s and positions of the sources , where the radii of the circles are proportional to rm , and white ( black ) circles denote negative ( positive ) rm s .",
    "the rm s of the extragalactic sources increase roughly in the direction of galactic latitude , indicating a galactic component to the rm s of the sources .",
    "we estimate a rm component intrinsic to the source of @xmath145 rad m@xmath13 , consistent with earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "the rm of the diffuse galactic radiation at the position of an extragalactic source is independent from the observed rm of the source itself ( see sect .  [ sec_rm ] ) .",
    "the rotation measure of the faraday - rotating material can be derived from @xmath15 ( see @xcite for details and pitfalls ) .",
    "[ fig2]a gives a 4@xmath3 resolution rm map ( which is oversampled ) , whereas in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , rm s are smoothed over 8 beams ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the average rm @xmath17 rad  m@xmath13 , and in general @xmath18 rad m@xmath13 .",
    "note that the rm structure in the diffuse radiation is of the same order of magnitude but uncorrelated to the rm s of the extragalactic sources .",
    "the galactic synchrotron radiation is emitted in a halo of relativistic electrons with a scale height @xmath23.6 kpc at the radius of the sun ( the `` thick disk '' in @xcite ) .",
    "the synchrotron emissivity is strongest in the galactic plane , and decreases outwards .",
    "reynolds determined the exponential scale height of thermal electrons in the galaxy to be @xmath19 kpc , forming the so - called reynolds layer @xcite .",
    "thus at several kpc above the galactic plane , the thermal electron density is very low and faraday rotation is negligible , whereas in the reynolds layer considerable faraday rotation occurs .",
    "the galactic magnetic field consists of a large - scale component , which at this longitude ( @xmath20 ) is almost perpendicular to the line of sight , and of a random component @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 ( determining the intensity of the synchrotron emission ) includes the complete large - scale galactic magnetic field , whereas @xmath22 ( determining faraday rotation ) is almost completely random .",
    "the non - detection of structure in synchrotron emissivity puts constraints on the structure in relativistic electron density @xmath23 and magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight , @xmath21 .",
    "absence of structure in @xmath23 and magnetic field in the halo is also observed in external galaxies , e.g. m51 @xcite and m31 @xcite . for total intensity @xmath4 to be constant in the reynolds layer as well , @xmath23 must be smooth , and the large - scale magnetic field component must dominate the turbulent component . if the reynolds layer consists of many cells with different turbulent magnetic field @xmath24 , some local variations in synchrotron emission could exist , which would be averaged out along the line of sight .",
    "however , a large amount of turbulent cells also decreases the degree of polarization . as we observe a high degree of polarization , the amount of possible turbulent cells is limited , and only a few k in local variations in total intensity",
    "could be erased in this way .",
    "so the polarized component of the synchrotron emission also has little or no small - scale structure .",
    "however , faraday rotation in the reynolds layer varies on small scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , inducing structure in polarization angle .",
    "linearly polarized radiation emitted at different depths is faraday - rotated by different amounts , which causes depolarization ( internal faraday dispersion @xcite ) on small scales , and so induces small - scale structure in @xmath6 .",
    "emission from the far side of the reynolds layer is mostly depolarized , so the polarized emission we observe comes from the nearest part of the layer .",
    "therefore , the observed rotation measure is built up in this nearest part of the layer , and structure in rm denotes structure in @xmath22 in the nearest part of the layer .",
    "the observed rm in extragalactic sources , however , is built up over the entire line of sight .",
    "the gradient in rm of the sources on degree scales in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , roughly in the direction of galactic latitude , is not visible in the rm structure of the diffuse radiation , i.e. not dominant in the nearest part of the reynolds layer .",
    "concluding , our observations of total intensity @xmath4 , polarized intensity @xmath6 , and rotation measure of diffuse radiation and extragalactic sources , impose many constraints on the possible nature of magnetic field and electron density in the warm ionized gas and in the synchrotron halo ( for details and calculations , see @xcite ) .",
