    "neutron stars have the strongest magnetic fields among the stars in the universe .",
    "in particular , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are considered to be magnetars , a special class of magnetized neutron stars .",
    "magnetars have very strong dipole magnetic fields whose typical values reach approximately @xmath0 g at their surfaces .",
    "they display stationary intense emissions and dynamical flares releasing magnetic energy ( @xcite ) . such magnetic activities are also considered to be their heating source ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field configurations are important for such astrophysical events because the decay of magnetic energy deeply depends on their structure . especially in relation to flares , both exterior and interior magnetic field structures are considered to be essential by many studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies have performed numerical simulations of crustal hall magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) secular evolutions ( @xcite ) and strongly twisted force - free magnetospheric dynamical evolutions ( @xcite ) to understand the flares . however , since the magnetic field structures of the core - crust ( interior ) and magnetosphere ( exterior ) should be coupled , we must consider them simultaneously . as a first step , in this paper we will systematically and simultaneously calculate the equilibrium magnetic field structure of magnetars throughout their interior and exterior",
    ".    the hall drift within the crust is considered to be vital for the internal field structure of magnetars .",
    "the hall drift itself does not dissipate the magnetic fields , but produces higher order components of the magnetic field during the hall cascade process .",
    "such higher order components of the magnetic field promote ohmic dissipation more efficiently ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the timescale of the hall drift is determined by the strength of the magnetic fields within the crust .",
    "the hall drift is characterized by the magnetic reynolds number @xmath1 ( @xcite ) as follows : , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are timescales of hall drift and ohmic dissipation , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are , respectively , the electrical conductivity of the crust , the speed of light , the electron number density , the charge of an electron .",
    "this value reaches approximately 1000 locally within the magnetar crust , because the crustal magnetic fields of the magnetar are sufficient large ( @xmath9 g ) .",
    "the hall drift becomes very effective in the magnetar crust and its timescale is faster than or comparable to the lifetime of magnetars .",
    "hall mhd numerical simulations have been performed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and these works examined the hall drift during the secular timescale .",
    "as shown in recent works , the toroidal magnetic fields decrease rapidly during the hall drift timescale because they are changed into higher order poloidal components by the hall cascade , and ohmic dissipation is promoted by the higher order components ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    according to these simulations , the hall cascade becomes very effective when the initial energy of the toroidal magnetic field is much larger than that of the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "therefore the energy ratio of the toroidal to the total magnetic field is a key factor in the secular evolution of the magnetic fields of magnetars . to investigate the magnetic field configurations of magnetars in equilibrium",
    ", we should include the hall drift .",
    "one approach is the hall equilibrium study .",
    "@xcite calculated hall equilibria with both poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields by solving the grad - shafranov equation .",
    "they considered crustal magnetic fields in a hall equilibrium and assumed a vacuum exterior . as @xcite pointed out , the hall equilibrium state is similar to the mhd equilibrium state which has been studied for sixty years since chandrasekhar and his colleagues pioneering works ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both analytical and theoretical methods for the mhd equilibrium state were developed and investigated in these studies .",
    "recently , some works considered more realistic and complex physical conditions in neutron star and magnetar interiors . @xcite considered stratification by chemical potentials in the neutron star interior and obtained stably stratified magnetized stars in general relativistic equilibrium . @xcite and @xcite calculated magnetized neutron star equilibria with stratification and type ii superconductivity in a newtonian framework . @xcite and @xcite solved the superconducting flux tube tension and obtained magnetic field configurations of a neutron star with a superconducting core and a normal mhd crust by using a self - consistent field method . @xcite",
    "have studied mhd magnetized star in equilibrium with twisted force - free magnetosphere by using a self - consistent field method . in their model ,",
    "the interior field is in equilibrium with its magnetosphere .",
    "however , they did not employ a realistic equation of state ( eos ) nor distinguish between its core and crust . since the previous hall mhd equilibrium ( @xcite )",
    "study did not include a twisted magnetosphere , nobody has obtained magnetized equilibria throughout a core - crust - magnetosphere , which is essential for the progress of magnetar understanding .    in this paper , we extended the above works and systematically and simultaneously obtained the magnetic field structures across the core , crust , and magnetosphere for the first time .",
    "we used a realistic eos to ensure that the core and crust are treated in an appropriate manner .",
    "we assumed crustal magnetic fields in the hall equilibrium , because we considered a magnetar with a strong magnetic field where the hall drift would be very effective within its crust .",
    "for simplicity , we assumed that the core is in mhd equilibrium .",
    "as described , the formulation of the hall equilibrium state is very similar to the mhd equilibrium state ( @xcite ) , but their physical meanings are different from each other .",
    "the mhd equilibrium state depends on mass density profiles because it describes the matter force balance . on the other hand ,",
    "the hall equilibrium state in the crust is determined by the electron number density distribution within the crust only and neglects the force balance of the crust .",
    "therefore , the crust in this paper is elastic and stressed by lorentz force of the crustal magnetic fields . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the magnetosphere is twisted and force - free .",
    "we adopted the equatorial shearing and ring models of @xcite as magnetospheric models .",
    "since we are interested in the magnetosphere near the star , we neglected the rotation of the magnetosphere . in summary",

    "the basic equations and models are described . in section 3",

    "the stationary mhd euler equation without rotation and meridional flow is described as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the mass density , pressure and gravitational potential , respectively . from the integrability condition of the euler equation ,",
    "we can obtain the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an another arbitrary function of @xmath15 .",

    "both poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields satisfy the hall equilibrium state .",
    "this model is equivalent to the configurations used by @xcite .",
    "this model requires the opposite current sheet on the core - crust boundary to prevent the poloidal magnetic fields from entering the core ( see app .",

    "model ii is a purely crustal current model .",
    "the poloidal magnetic fields can penetrate the core region , but in this model , the toroidal magnetic field is confined within the crust region .",
    "the current density only exists within the crust .",
    "this model does not have the opposite current sheet on the core - crust boundary .",
    "therefore , the core magnetic field is the inner vacuum solution of the crustal current .",

    "model iv is a core - crust current model . the toroidal current density in the core flows in the opposite direction to the crustal current in this model .",
    "the core magnetic fields energy in this model is much larger than the crustal magnetic fields energy , because such oppositely flowing toroidal current density makes the core magnetic fields energy much larger ( @xcite ) .",

    "the initial magnetic field configurations in the magnetar interior are still unclear , but they would have strong toroidal magnetic fields because of the rapid differential rotation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the magnetar would be in a stable mhd equilibrium state because the alfvn timescale ( @xmath119s for a typical magnetar with magnetic fields in the order of @xmath120 g ) is much faster than the dynamical and crust forming timescales",

    "we assumed that the value equal to that of the core electrical conductivity @xmath220 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the width of the current sheet is @xmath221 , then the dissipation timescale of the current sheet @xmath222 is evaluated by @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the width of the current sheet .",
    "the grid number of the star is @xmath225 ( see app .",
    "[ app : accuracy ] ) and the grid size is @xmath226 in this paper . although @xmath224 is much smaller than the grid size @xmath227 , the dissipation timescale @xmath222 is much larger than the hall timescale @xmath228 .",
    "therefore , we can treat the current sheet as a @xmath50 function ( eq . [ eq : j_sur ] ) and consider the magnetar models with a current sheet at the core - crust interface in this paper as possible configurations ."
