    "all the equations we shall consider here are semi - linear wave equations with derivative non - linearities .",

    "however , we do not allow @xmath7 to contain second order derivatives of @xmath8 .",
    "also , we will restrict ourselves here to the case where the non - linearity @xmath7 has constant coefficients and is a polynomial of degree @xmath9 or higher in the vector @xmath10 with no interaction of the type @xmath11 .",
    "this is not a severe restriction because it still includes the class of gauge  field equations on minkowski space , which is one of the main motivations of this work : + specifically , let @xmath12 be a compact , semi ",

    "that is , the lorentz gauge condition propagates .",
    "notice that if the second condition in is to be satisfied , then from the equations , we must have that the temporal potential @xmath26 satisfies the following elliptic constraint equation at @xmath24 : @xmath27(0 ) +   [ a^\\alpha , f_{\\alpha\\beta}](0 ) \\ .       \\label{elliptic_constraint}\\ ] ] this implies that in general , the initial data for the system ( and indeed for the system ) can not decay better than @xmath28 .",
    "this fact is known as the _ charge problem _ , and causes certain difficulties in the global theory of .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail shortly .",
    "+ we now return to the more general discussion of equations of type .",
    "our main concern will be the global in time regularity properties for these kind of systems .",
    "this type of question has been considered by many authors for various spatial dimensions , and it is not possible to give here a complete account of all the progress that has been made to date . in the case of @xmath29 spatial dimensions , that is @xmath0 dimensional minkowski space , the first general theory of the global behavior of non - linear systems of the form",
    "was given by the breakthrough work of s. klainerman @xcite .",
    "specifically , he showed that if the non - linearity on the right hand side of is schematically of the form : @xmath30 and the cauchy data : @xmath31 is sufficiently smooth and decays sufficiently fast at ( space - like ) infinity , then as long as the corresponding norms are small enough a global solution to with this initial data exists .",
    "the method of that paper was based on controlling the @xmath32 norm @xmath33 to such an extent that duhamel s principle could be used globally in time .",
    "that is , one makes crucial use of the _ uniform _ decay of the solutions to the non - linear problem .",
    "this decay is provided by certain weighted energy estimates which can naturally be recover by commuting the various weights ( vector fields ) with the linear equation on the left hand side of . at the outset",
    ", the result of @xcite did not include the case where the non - linear system takes the form ( again schematically ) : @xmath34 which is the general interaction type of the lorentz yang ",
    "mills equations . a somewhat more involved argument",
    "is needed to get around the fact that the natural quantity one can gain @xmath32 control of via the energy method is @xmath35 instead of @xmath5 .",
    "this problem was handled by hrmander in @xcite , who used certain riesz potential modifications of the usual energy to gain the needed @xmath32 control on @xmath5 .",
    "notice that in some sense , the problem is critical with respect to the decay of @xmath5 .",
    "this can easily be seen by integrating the naive asymptotic one would have for @xmath35 : @xmath36 to obtain @xmath37 , which just fails to be integrable globally in time . through the use of morawetz type multipliers .",
    "however , the price one pays for this is the presence of extra weights in the energy integral .",
    "once these are taken into account , one will see again that ( at least alone the forward light cone",
    "t = r ) the decay in @xmath38 is critical . ]",
    "heuristically , this means that one can not close a boot - strapping argument for the system without allowing either modifying the energy in some way , allowing it to grow , or finding some family of exact space ",
    "time integrals to control error estimates which come from the differentiation of the non - linearity . a major drawback of the results",
    "@xcite@xcite is that they assume the initial data is either compactly supported or decays in such a way that it is @xmath39 .",
    "that is , the data is assumed to decay like @xmath40 as @xmath41 . as we have mentioned in our previous discussion of the yang - mills equations ,",
    "this kind of decay rate is not quite attainable . for these reasons , as well as its intrinsic interest ,",
    "we introduce here a completely different method for studying the global behavior of which is based on recent advances in the low regularity theory of general non - linear wave equations . as a point of comparison , this method allows us to handle initial data which only decays like @xmath42 at infinity . +",
    "the method we employ here is not based in any way on the uniform properties of solutions to the system . instead , our point of departure will be the following simple observation : let @xmath5 be a given solution to the system . then is is easy to see that if one performs the scale transformation : @xmath43 the resulting function @xmath44 is also a solution to the set of equations .",
    "this is just a reflection of the fact that the equations are homogeneous .",
    "suppose now that one could produce a banach space @xmath45 which is dimensionless with respect to the scale transformation at time @xmath24 .",
    "that is , one has the identity : @xmath46 suppose that furthermore , one had an existence theorem which said that any set of initial data for which is small enough , there is a local in time solution to with this initial data .",
    "then , by simply re - scaling , such a local existence theorem would necessarily be global in time . because the equations we are considering are hyperbolic",
    ", it is natural to look for a @xmath45 which is an energy type space .",
    "a simple calculation shows that on @xmath4 , the sobolev space which is scale invariant with respect to ( at @xmath24 ) is the energy space @xmath47 .",
    "however , it is not at all unreasonable to expect that such a space is far too weak to control solutions to locally in time .",
    "for example , @xmath47 in @xmath29 spatial dimensions is a whole derivative ( and then some ) away from controlling @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , one can see immediately from looking at the first non - trivial picard iterate to that one starts to loose regularity as soon as the initial data is rougher than @xmath48 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , by an adaptation of the @xmath49 dimensional counterexamples of lindblad @xcite , one should be able to show that certain instances of the equations are ill - posed in the sobolev spaces @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the situation in @xmath52 and higher dimensions , where one can come arbitrarily close to the scale invariant sobolev space @xmath53 @xcite , and can in fact recover local existence in the scale invariant besov space @xmath54 in @xmath55 and higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "+ the reason why the low dimensional setting is more difficult to control than the higher dimensional regime it that `` parallel '' interactions in the non - linearity on the right hand side of become stronger and stronger as the dimension decreases .",
    "closely related to this is the range of validity of the so called strichartz estimates .",
    "specifically , in @xmath0 dimensions , one looses the @xmath56 strichartz estimate which clearly plays a major role via duhamel s principle in the well posedness theory equations with quadratic type interactions ( that is , one looks to put the non - linearity in @xmath57 ) . for an important class of equations with special structure in the non - linearity ,",
    "this interaction of parallel waves is largely destroyed , and one can gain the needed improvement over the @xmath48 barrier to come arbitrarily close to the scaling .",
    "for example , this was accomplished by klainerman - tataru in @xcite for the yang - mills equations with the coulomb gauge enforced .",
    "going even further in this direction , it should be possible to combine the besov space technique of @xcite with the compound null structure estimates . specifically , compounding the non - linearity of in the coulomb gauge , and taking into account various cancellations due to the null structures present , one arrives at a set of equations that morally looks like @xmath58 .",
    "this equation looks a lot like wave - maps , except that the weights are distributed in a more unfavorable fashion . in particular ,",
    "while it is true that one can get @xmath59 at fixed frequency , there is no room left to add over the low frequencies in a @xmath60 interaction .",
    "therefore , even if one assumes a besov structure for the @xmath8 , there is not enough room to close .",
    "however , this is exactly the bad frequency interaction which is eliminated by the tri - linear null structure of @xcite . ] discussed in @xcite to push the global well - posedness theory of these ( coulomb gauge ) equations to the scale invariant besov space @xmath61 .",
    "finally it is conjectured , and a major open problem of this subject , that by either working with the curvature directly or by making use of the coulomb gauge restriction of the equations , the equations are well posed in the scale invariant sobolev space @xmath47 .",
    "+ however , our interest here is in the lorentz gauge equations , and more generally equations which are generically of the type .",
    "an inspection of the non - linearity in reveals that it does not seem to contain the special `` null structure '' of the non - linearity of in the coulomb gauge ( at least at the bilinear level ) , and it is a tentative conjecture that these specific equations are in fact ill - posed for regularities less than @xmath62 .",
    "this brings into question whether one can prove scale invariant global existence in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that any modification to that theory will need to go away from translation invariant spaces .",
    "that is , one is led to look for a theory which includes the low regularity micro - local techniques of @xcite , but somehow makes crucial use of the weighted vector - field from @xcite .",
    "one idea is to understand how the presence of homogeneous weighted derivatives effects the range of validity of the strichartz estimates .",
    "because the main obstacle to improved estimates of this type is the presence of waves which are highly concentrated along a given null direction , it is natural to expect that the rotation generators : @xmath63 play a distinguished role because they penalize such objects .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case , and one gains a significant improvement at the level of both linear and bilinear estimates as was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this observation will form the basis for the first main ingredient of the approach we take here , which is to better control the linear theory . at the non - linear level",
    ", one would expect that the rotations also play a major role because they would help to eliminate parallel interactions coming in the right hand side of .",
    "in other words , one would hope that in some sense the rotations could substitute for the null - structures one makes use of in the coulomb gauge . again , this turns out to be the case and will form the second main pillar of the approach we take here which is to build function spaces that take into account `` angular concentration '' phenomena .",
    "what we will do is prove prove the following theorem : +    [ gwp_theorem ] for the generic system of non  linear wave equations on @xmath0 dimensional minkowski space , there exists constants @xmath64 such that if @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the banach space with norm : @xmath67 and likewise for @xmath68 , then there exits a global solution @xmath69 to the system with initial data @xmath70 which satisfies the stability condition : @xmath71 in particular , there is no energy growth of the solution to .",
    "the solution @xmath69 is unique and depends smoothly on the initial data in the following sense : there exists a sequence of smooth functions @xmath72 such that : @xmath73 for this sequence of functions , there exists a sequence of unique smooth global solutions @xmath74 of with this initial data .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath74 converge to @xmath69 as follows : @xmath75 also , @xmath69 is the only solution which may be obtained as a limit ( in the above sense ) of solutions to with regularizations of @xmath76 as initial data .",
    "finally , @xmath69 retains any extra smoothness inherent in the initial data .",
    "that is , if @xmath70 also has finite @xmath77 norm , for @xmath78 , then so does @xmath69 at fixed time and one has the following estimate : @xmath79    in a straightforward way , our estimates also address the issue of the asymptotic freedom of the system . as an immediate corollary of our approach , we have that : +    [ scattering_result ] using the same notation as above , for our solution @xmath69 to the system with initial data @xmath70 , there exists data sets @xmath80 , such that if @xmath81 is the solution to the homogeneous wave equation , @xmath82 , with this initial data , the following asymptotics hold : @xmath83 furthermore , the scattering operator retains any additional regularity inherent in the initial data .",
    "that is , if @xmath70 has finite @xmath84 norm , then so does @xmath80 , and the following asymptotics hold : @xmath85    in the statement of the generic system and in proof of theorem [ gwp_theorem ] we have ignored the cubic type interactions @xmath86 which appear on the left hand side of . notice that these terms respect the scaling .",
    "it turns out that they are trivial to treat in the spaces we use here by taking a product of the @xmath87 strichartz estimate which is available in @xmath0 dimension .",
    "the only real issue is to make sure that one recovers the besov structure for @xmath60 frequency interactions , but this is again a triviality due to the room in the @xmath87 estimate ( one does not even have to use bilinear estimates to do this ) .    for convenience",
    ", we have chosen to work here with the spaces which involve a whole angular ( momentum ) derivative . as the reader will see shortly , there is much room in the dyadic estimates of our proof .",
    "specifically , it should be possible to prove our theorem with the use of only a little more then @xmath88 an angular derivative .",
    "however , this would force one to work out @xmath32 paraproducts in the angular variable , which would bring another layer of technical complications that we have chosen to avoid .",
    "however , this still leaves an interesting gap because based on the local theory one would expect that , say for compactly supported initial data , there is global regularity for small @xmath89 norm .",
    "therefore , in some sense , our estimates seem to fall @xmath90 a derivative short of the optimal level . perhaps this gap can be eliminated by somehow incorporating ( fractional powers of ) the other invariant vector - fields . in particular , the boosts @xmath91 .",
    "we will say no more of this here .",
    "we have not included here a specific discussion of the first set of model equations .",
    "it turns out that these are a bit easier to treat than the equations . in other words ,",
    "the difference between and which can be seen at the level of decay can also be seen at the micro - local level .",
    "specifically , for the equations , the estimate below would be much easier to prove because it would not need the bilinear estimates .",
    "it should be noted however , that the somewhat more involved version of the estimate which we use here can also directly be used in the proof of the well - posedness of equations of type .",
    "for quantities @xmath92 and @xmath45 , we denote by @xmath93 to mean that @xmath94 for some large constant @xmath95 .",
    "the constant @xmath95 may change from line to line , but will always remain fixed for any given instance where this notation appears .",
    "likewise we use the notation @xmath96 to mean that @xmath97 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath98 to mean that @xmath99 for some large constant @xmath95 .",
    "this is the notation we will use throughout the paper to break down quantities into the standard cases : @xmath96 , or @xmath98 , or @xmath100 ; and @xmath93 , or @xmath100 , without ever discussing which constants we are using .",
    "we will also employ the following notation to indicate arbitrarily small adjustments to a given numerical value :  for a given constant @xmath92 , we write @xmath101 ( resp .",

    "+ for a given function of two variables @xmath109 we write the spatial and space  time fourier transform as : @xmath110 respectively . because we are not assuming any extra structure in the non - linearity of , we will work almost exclusively with the space - time fourier transform .",

    "the first order of business concerns defining fractional powers of the spherical laplacean : @xmath123 as is well known , this can be done via spectral resolution , and we write : @xmath124 the operator kills off the spherically symmetric part of any function it is applied to . because of this , we will employ the following `` inhomogeneous '' version of this operator : @xmath125 where @xmath111 is a function of the spatial variable , and @xmath126 denotes the spherically symmetric part of @xmath111 .",
    "that is : @xmath127 a key property of the operators @xmath128 is that they commute with the spatial ( and thus space - time ) fourier transform : @xmath129 also , we have the following equivalence of sobolev type norms subscript in conjunction with numerical superscripts , e.g. the @xmath130 in @xmath131 , will always denote angular derivatives in this section .",
    "in other places in the paper the @xmath132 subscript will always mean _ one _ angular derivative , while the superscripts will denote translation invariant derivatives .",
    "an example of this is the notation @xmath133 introduced on line .",
    "] involving the unit power @xmath134 : @xmath135 because all of the norms we build here will be based on the unit powers @xmath134 , we will by abuse of notation replace any instance of a single @xmath136 with the operator @xmath137 , and although it is not strictly true , we will assume that there is the _ point - wise _ leibniz rule : @xmath138 this will be a great convenience to us because some of the norms we define below are @xmath32 based ( in particular and ) , where it would be difficult to define paraproducts for fractional powers @xmath139 . + finally , we record here two basic results which follow from the littlewood - paley theorem for the sphere , in conjunction with interpolation in weighted spaces of the type @xmath140 ( again , see @xcite for details ) : +    [ sph_sob_prop ] if @xmath17 is a test function on the unit sphere @xmath141 , then the following estimate holds for @xmath142 : @xmath143 where the implicit constants depend only on @xmath144 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath111 is a test function on @xmath4 and @xmath145 , then one has : @xmath146    [ sph_interp_prop ] let @xmath147 denote the norm : @xmath148 for functions @xmath111 of the spatial variable only .",
    "then for @xmath149 one has the following interpolation spaces : @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we list here the space  time estimates for the homogeneous wave equations which form the foundation for our proof of theorem [ gwp_theorem ] . as we have mentioned before , all of these are of `` strichartz type '' .",
    "the first group of estimates we will use are just the classical strichartz estimates for the wave equation which we state for the case of @xmath0 dimensions : +    [ classical_str_th ] let @xmath153 be the number of spatial dimensions , and let @xmath154 be the corresponding strichartz admissible exponent . if @xmath111 is any function of the spatial variable only , denote by @xmath155 its unit frequency projection ( see ) .",
    "then one has the following family estimates for @xmath156 : @xmath157 where @xmath158 .    as was discussed in the introduction , the estimates alone are not strong enough to close a global iteration argument for non - linear wave equations of the form .",
    "what is needed is an improvement of the range of admissible @xmath159 indices on the left hand side of .",
    "it is well known that this can not be accomplished within the context of translation invariant smoothness assumptions on the initial data ( see @xcite ) . however , incorporating extra weighted smoothness assumptions for the angular variable provides the needed mechanism to overcome this obstacle .",

    "only a small subset of the indices @xmath159 in the two propositions listed above will be of use to us .",

    "the standard device for dealing with this problem is the use of bilinear strichartz estimates .",
    "we will use here t. tao s fine  course scale idea for dealing with these ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is to fix a scale , say @xmath172 for @xmath173 , and then decompose the domain of the spatial variable into cubes with side lengths @xmath174 .",
    "then , one replaces the usual @xmath175 norm in the spatial variable with @xmath176 , where the @xmath39 norm is taken on the `` fine '' scale of each individual cube , while the @xmath177 norm represents the `` coarse '' scale which is summation over all cubes .",
    "one reason this method is so powerful , is that it allows one to use the bilinear construction process directly in an iteration procedure , where resorting to the canned estimates that this method ultimately provides may be unduly burdensome .",
    "this is crucial when dealing with eccentric multipliers as we do here .",
    "therefore , we will only state the two scale estimates themselves , without mentioning the various bilinear estimates which follow as a corollary . for point of reference , we point out here that these estimates will only be used in the proof of estimate below .",

    "we state these in encapsulated form here for the convenience of the reader : + @xmath187 + notice that we have added an extra @xmath88 an angular derivative to the right hand side of above .",
    "this is how we will use this estimate in this paper , and is a reflection of the fact that we have elected to work with integral powers of the angular momentum operator @xmath188 in this work .",

    "this is one of the main reasons why the use of strichartz estimates which only involve the rotation vector fields is so crucial to the approach taken in this paper . indeed ,",

    "this is due to the presence of a very specific @xmath254 frequency interaction in the term @xmath255 .",
    "what is needed to circumvent this problem is to add some extra @xmath189 norms to the @xmath17 spaces .",
    "this idea originally goes back to the work of klainerman ",
    "machedon @xcite , and was later used to its full extent in tataru @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we used a slight innovation on the norms in @xcite which allowed one to work in a scale invariant setting . here",
    "it will be necessary for us to use somewhat more technical versions of those norms , in part because some of the estimates we need to prove here are essentially tri - linear in nature .",
    "to define these norms for a given test function @xmath231 at frequency @xmath256 , we first consider all ways that one may write : @xmath257 for each @xmath258 , we consider a set of solid angles , @xmath259 , with the property that each @xmath260 .",
