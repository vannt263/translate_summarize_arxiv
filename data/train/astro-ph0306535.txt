    "x - ray spectra of virialized hot gas associated with early type galaxies , galaxy groups and clusters indicate that the gas cools at less than a small fraction of the rate implied by their x - ray luminosities , ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; bhringer et al . 2002 ; xu et al .",
    "there is no spectral evidence for gas at temperatures less than @xmath0 . as a result of these observations",
    ", it is often claimed that there is no cooling at all .",
    "many authors have speculated that the gas is heated by an active nucleus ( agn ) in the cluster - centered e or cd galaxy and that this heating can explain the absence of gas at @xmath1 .",
    "the notion of agn heating is also supported by the centrally disturbed gas visible in chandra images of galaxy groups ( e.g. buote et al .",
    "further evidence for hot bubbles on galaxy / group scales is provided by two ( or limited multi ) temperature spectral fits over an extended central region of the x - ray emitting gas in galaxy groups ( buote 2002 ; 2003 ; tamura et al .",
    "the hot phase @xmath2 is typically 2 or 3 times hotter than the cooler phase @xmath3 , but @xmath4 resembles the best - fitting temperature profiles in single phase spectral models . on the larger scales of galaxy clusters that contain powerful radio sources ,",
    "huge bubbles of hot gas are apparently formed by strong cluster - centered radio galaxies and then buoyantly migrate out from the center of the flow .",
    "( fabian et al 2000 ; mcnamara et al . 2000 ) .",
    "although the absence of apparent cooling and the evidence for x - ray surface brightness fluctuations are shared by flows of all scales  galaxies or clusters  we are particularly interested here with galaxy / group flows because they may be less likely to have been disturbed by recent mergers and because the dominant stellar mass within the effective radius provides an independent measure of the gravitational potential .",
    "the salient question that we address is : can central heating greatly reduce the gas cooling rate @xmath5 and also be consistent with the observed mean temperature of the hot gas ? to explore possible answers to this question , we consider models in which bubbles of hot gas are heated to supervirial temperatures near the central agn and then rise buoyantly to large radii .",
    "the bubbles move upstream in a normal cooling inflow in which gas slowly flows toward the central potential minimum , losing energy by radiative losses . to avoid cooling to intermediate and low temperatures ,",
    "the heated bubbles must carry outward all the mass arriving at the center of the cooling flow .",
    "the characteristic decline in the observed ( single - phase ) gas temperature toward the center of these flows , @xmath6 , is rather clear evidence that normal radiative cooling is driving an inflow of gas toward the center . in the circulation",
    "flows we consider here , this cooling is assumed to be arrested by bubble formation associated with agn heating .",
    "flows in which cooling does not occur are expected to be in a steady state , at least on average . however , stellar mass loss and cooling or accretion inflow of hot gas from very large radii will cause the mass of gas in the circulation flow to increase slowly with time until some type of sudden cooling occurs .",
    "however , it is possible that idealized , quasi - steady circulation flows may persist for sustained periods without cooling , punctuated by intermittent cooling events . remarkably , there is little or no observational evidence of ongoing or recent global cooling events in well - observed flows .",
    "can heated gas moving upstream in the cooling flow carry away all the mass arriving at the center and still be consistent with the low central temperatures and positive temperature gradients determined by ( single - phase ) x - ray temperature observations ? this is a question of some interest to us since our studies of agn - heated cooling flows using numerical gasdynamical simulations have been unsuccessful in agreeing with the central temperature profiles observed ( brighenti & mathews 2002 ; 2003 ) .",
    "when agn heating is sufficient to arrest central cooling , the gas cools at larger radii in the flow and the overall temperature gradient becomes negative throughout a large central region , unlike the observations .",
    "however , more analytic and idealized solutions without numerical diffusion , such as we consider here , may capture details of the flow that can not be easily duplicated in gasdynamical simulations . to keep the apparent temperature from rising sharply toward the central agn ,",
    "it is necessary that the x - ray emission is not dominated by hot bubbles along the line of sight and that the inflowing gas is not heated too much by the counter - streaming bubbles .",
    "we show here that idealized steady state circulation flows can be constructed that are consistent with observed temperature profiles , but only for bubbles in a restricted mass range and only for a limited spatial region and time .",
    "the discovery of x - ray holes or bubbles in rich clusters has resulted in a large number of numerical simulations .",
    "most of these simulations focus on the evolutionary interaction of powerful radio jets and lobes from cluster - centered radio galaxies with the adjacent hot gas and do not quantitatively address the essential question whether or not strong radio jets can keep the gas from cooling to low temperatures and still preserve the density and temperature profiles observed . in the following section we briefly review some of these numerical studies and contrast them with the the heated flows we consider here .",
    "the interaction of energetic supersonic jets with the hot gas has been simulated by many authors ( e.g. basson & alexander 2003 ; reynolds , heinz & begelman 2002 ) .",
    "these numerical studies may accurately portray the initial active phases in which a high velocity jet from a central agn first enters the hot gas .",
    "but supersonic jets create strong bow shocks that heat the ambient gas within a large cocoon . in most x - ray observations",
    "there is no convincing evidence for extended shock - heated gas , although such phases may be relatively short - lived .    in response to the apparent absence of gas at supervirial temperatures ,",
    "many jet - lobe simulations have been designed that do not produce large masses of strongly shocked gas .",
    "these simulations typically involve an _ ad hoc _ slow release of energy ( and mass ) in fixed regions at some distance from the central agn ( e.g. brggen 2003a ; brggen & kaiser 2001 , 2002 ; brggen et al .",
    "2002 ; churazov et al . 2001",
    "; quilis , bower & balogh 2001 ) .",
    "brggen and his collaborators have studied the consequences of injecting ultrahot gas with zero net velocity into fixed spherical regions of size @xmath7 kpc located @xmath8 kpc from the central agn in galaxy clusters . evidently , this type of energy release is an approximation to a stationary working surface of a jet .",
    "the hot gas atmosphere surrounding the agn is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium with outward increasing entropy .",
    "the luminosities of the energy injection , @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 , are usually chosen for each simulation to be near the maximum possible @xmath11 that can still produce buoyant plumes and bubbles ; larger @xmath11 would evacuate gas throughout the entire cluster core in times shorter than the buoyancy rise time ( e.g. brggen 2003a ) .",
    "a common feature of these solutions is that cooler , low entropy ambient gas follows upward in a transient `` entrained '' flow behind the rising hot gas .",
    "this transient , approximately axisymmetric convective circulation occurs as the rising gas is replaced by downflowing ambient gas surrounding the jet axis that turns and flows upward behind the heated gas .",
    "after @xmath12 myrs , when the energy injection is turned off , some of this `` uplifted '' low entropy gas typically begins to fall back toward the center , perhaps re - energizing the central agn at a later time with a feedback mechanism .",
    "while these papers are useful contributions to our understanding of the interactions of powerful radio jets with the hot gas , the authors often note that the cooling flow @xmath5 may be reduced if energy is released in this manner with duty cycle @xmath13 .",
    "however , the mass cooling rate @xmath14 near the flow center is not explicitly calculated so it is difficult to link these simulations to the problem of the low upper limits on @xmath5 set by xmm observations .    by contrast , our numerical simulations study feedback heating and @xmath5 reduction in genuine cooling flows over times comparable to the hubble time ( brighenti & mathews 2002 , 2003 )",
    ". the original gas is heated by the central agn and no new mass is introduced .",
    "@xmath14 at the flow center and elsewhere is monitored throughout the entire calculation . in our experience , when these cooling flows are sufficiently heated to reduce the central cooling rate @xmath5 , as xmm observations require , the azimuthally - averaged temperature and density profiles typically deviate from those observed .",
    "when cooling is suppressed by heating near the center , we find that it occurs at the same rate but at larger radii in the flow . in flows with off - center jet - like heating , the gas at large angles relative to the heating axis easily flows toward the center and eventually cools to low temperatures .    the flow heating problem on galaxy / group scales that we consider here is very different from the heating of hot gas in richer galaxy clusters by powerful , linearly oriented radio jets and lobes .",
    "many flows with undetected @xmath5 do not contain powerful radio jets .",
    "for example , when observed with xmm - newton , the galaxy / group ngc 5044 shows no rgs or epic spectral evidence of gas cooling to temperatures below about 0.7 kev ( tamura et al . 2003 ; buote et al .",
    "the ( single phase ) gas temperature profile drops from about 1.2 kev at 30 kpc down to 0.7 kev at the origin , similar to many other e galaxies and qualitatively similar to @xmath15 in rich clusters .",
    "also , like most elliptical galaxies , ngc 5044 has an unexceptional and unresolved weak central mjy ghz point source ( nrao / vla sky survey ; condon et al .",
    "however , the _ chandra _ image of ngc 5044 ( fig .",
    "1 of buote et al .",
    "2003 ) shows that the hot gas within at least @xmath16 kpc is highly disturbed in an azimuthally random and chaotic manner .",
    "in addition , temperature fluctuations in the range @xmath17 kev are observed out to @xmath18 kpc ( buote et al .",
    "the most important morphological attribute of these thermal and density irregularities is that they are symmetric about the center of ngc 5044 , with no evidence of jet - like orientation .",
    "if agn heating is the agency that keeps the gas from cooling , the heating in ngc 5044 and other similar e galaxies must be more radially symmetric than the jet - heating considered in the radio galaxy simulations discussed above .",
    "alternatively , because of the short dynamical times in galaxy scale flows , the jet axis in would have to be randomly reoriented every @xmath19 years to maintain the appearance of symmetric heating .",
    "finally , the outward mass flux @xmath5 is likely to be maximized in spherically symmetric bubble outflows that move away from the central agn in every direction .",
    "ruszkowski & begelman ( 2002 ) and brggen ( 2003b ) have studied non - cooling , static models of cluster gas atmospheres .",
    "the gas is heated at large radii by thermal conduction and at small radii by a cloud of tiny expanding bubbles , a heating mechanism proposed by begelman ( 2001 ) .",
    "the heating is spherically symmetric , similar to the flows we discuss here .",
    "these cluster - scale models are almost uniquely successful in preserving the positive temperature gradient observed .",
    "however , this combination of central heating and conduction does not work for flows on galaxy / group scales ; even with the maximum ( spitzer ) conductivity it is impossible to get both small @xmath5 and acceptable temperature gradients ( brighenti & mathews 2003 ) . in the heating scheme proposed by ruszkowski & begelman a large number of very small `` effervescent '' bubbles are produced near the central agn and buoyantly flow into the hot gas throughout a large volume , acquiring a steady state radial distribution .",
    "the bubbles do not mix thermally with the ambient gas but expand adiabatically , heating the ambient flow by @xmath20 work as they expand . while this bubble model has some features in common with that considered here , we find that very small bubbles are inconsistent with steady state circulating flows . in the following discussion",
    "we investigate the possibility that hot gas in galaxy / groups similar to ngc 4472 or ngc 5044 is heated near the center of the flow and converted into hot bubbles .",
    "the rising bubbles are required to carry mass outward at the same rate that mass arrives in the core by normal radiative losses in the interbubble flow .",
    "the interbubble flow receives both momentum and energy from the rising bubbles . to optimize the outward rate of mass transfer , the heating is assumed to be symmetric about the central agn , not confined to a single jet",
    "we explore here the conditions required to establish oppositely moving , two phase , steady state flows in galaxy / groups in which the gas does not cool to low temperatures . a cool phase near the virial temperature flows inward as in a normal cooling flow . at some small radius @xmath21",
    "we assume this flow is heated and transformed into hot bubbles that buoyantly float upstream in the cooling flow , returning the mass flux received in the incoming flow to some large circulation radius @xmath22 where the bubble entropy matches that of the local cooling flow gas .",
    "gas circulates in the gravitational field like a thermodynamic engine .",
    "the mechanism that produces the bubbles is not specified and for simplicity the physical condition of the gas within @xmath21 or beyond @xmath22 are not considered .",
    "clearly , an idealized steady flow model like this can not be strictly correct since the mass of circulating gas is expected to gradually increase due to stellar mass loss and inflow of gas from @xmath23 .",
    "as the mass of circulating gas slowly increases , the increasing gas density should eventually lead to extensive cooling .",
    "nevertheless , a quasi - steady circulation model could be a reasonable representation for a limited time between cooling episodes . unlike the numerical simulations described earlier , no new mass is injected into the flow .",
    "we also assume that the hot bubbles retain their coherency as they move through @xmath24 bubble diameters .",
    "this degree of coherence is in fact observed in the perseus cluster ( fabian et al .",
    "2000 ) , assuming that the distant `` ghost cavities '' were formed closer to the central agn .",
    "the hot bubbles simulated by churazov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) float upward in the cooling flow atmosphere and come to rest at some large radius where the ambient entropy is equal to that within the bubble .",
    "however , we have found bubble evolution to be a difficult problem for numerical gasdynamics and we remain sceptical of our assumption of bubble coherency .",
    "the bubbles in perseus may be stabilized by internal magnetic fields .",
    "it would be relatively easy to modify our circulation model to include bubble fragmentation according to some _ ad hoc _ prescription , but the effect of bubble fragmentation can easily be imagined by comparing similar circulation flows having different constant bubble masses .    in our circulating flows the hot bubbles",
    "do not thermally mix ( by thermal conduction for example ) with the incoming flow before reaching the circulation radius @xmath22 where the bubble and inflow entropies are approximately equal .",
    "thermal mixing is another effect that could be included in more complicated circulation flows , but our assumption of no thermal mixing is a limiting case of interest . if premature bubble - flow thermalization occurs , the inflowing gas will be heated and the apparent temperature profile is likely to become negative , unlike the ( single phase ) temperature profiles observed .",
    "unintended thermal mixing may have occurred in our numerical simulations of heated cooling flows because of the limited numerical resolution ( brighenti & mathews 2002 ; 2003 ) .",
    "when the bubbles and interbubble flow are viewed along the same line of sight , an apparent positive @xmath25 can be maintained if the filling factor @xmath26 of the rapidly moving bubbles is relatively small and if the bubbles do not significantly heat the ambient gas .",
    "we show that the constraint @xmath27 also limits the heating that bubbles can receive at the heating radius @xmath21 and therefore also the radial extent @xmath22 of the circulation .",
    "finally , to keep our circulation models as simple as possible , we have resisted a temptation to include an additional pressure component within the bubbles due to ( relativistic ) cosmic rays or magnetic fields .",
    "an additional nonthermal pressure could help increase the outer radius @xmath22 of the circulation , but may transport less mass outward .",
    "nevertheless , many of the same constraints we derive here for purely thermal circulations also apply to bubbles with nonthermal buoyancy .",
    "our approximate , idealized circulation flows are not intended to reproduce the observed properties of any particular group or cluster although we use parameters for the massive elliptical galaxy ngc 4472 whenever appropriate .",
    "the steady state equation of continuity for the inflowing gas @xmath28 contains the fraction of the volume @xmath29 filled by the inflowing gas .",
    "the bubble filling factor is @xmath30 .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath31 are negative .",
    "the equation of motion and the conservation of thermal energy in the cooling inflow are @xmath32 and @xmath33 here we define @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the molecular weight so the gas pressure is @xmath36 .",

    "the cooling flow equations are solved indirectly by requiring that the gas density match the observed density in ngc 4472 at the end points of the circulation , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . to illustrate a typical solution of this two - point boundary value problem",
    ", we consider a circulation flow between radii @xmath61 and @xmath62 kpc .",
    "the instantaneous rate that gas cools in this annular region can be determined from @xmath63 using the observed @xmath15 and @xmath42 profiles and evaluating @xmath64 with an assumed abundance 0.5 solar .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical solution of equations ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) for a cooling flow without bubbles ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) between @xmath68 and @xmath69 assuming @xmath70 @xmath47 yr@xmath10 .",
    "when the flow equations are solved iteratively in the manner described , both the temperature profile and its end - point values are completely determined by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the modest disagreements apparent in figure 1 between the computed temperature and density and the profiles observed in ngc 4472 are expected because of the approximations we have made : steady state flow , suppression of mass loss from stars , no gas extending beyond @xmath22 , etc . when the flow is subsonic ( @xmath73 ) the temperature gradient @xmath74 ( equation 5 ) has the same sign as @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath76 , it is clear that the radiative term is responsible for the positive temperature gradients observed .",
    "although the flow temperature gradient in figure 1 is flat , @xmath77 , this solution is entirely adequate for our purposes here : to determine the influence of counter - moving bubbles on the observed thermal properties of the flow .",
    "we are primarily interested in _ differential _ changes in the temperature profile when bubbles are introduced .",
    "a circulation flow without cooling below @xmath78 can be maintained if the inflowing gas is heated at radius @xmath21 , forming bubbles of hot gas that rise buoyantly upstream in the cooling flow . at @xmath21",
    "the bubbles have temperature @xmath79 where @xmath78 is the local cooling flow temperature and @xmath80 is a dimensionless heating factor . to avoid needless complications ,",
    "all bubbles are assumed to have the same mass @xmath81 for each solution ; the consequences of bubble breakup can be inferred from solutions with different @xmath82 .",
    "as they move outwards , the hot bubbles evolve adiabatically ( @xmath83 ) in pressure equilibrium with the ambient gas .",
    "the density inside the bubbles is @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the equation of motion of the bubbles is dominated by the drag force so the terminal velocity is reached almost immediately after they are formed . when moving at the terminal velocity , the forces on the bubble balance : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the bubble velocity .",
    "the external pressure force on the bubble is the pressure gradient across the bubble @xmath89 times the mean chord through a sphere @xmath90 and the bubble area @xmath91 .",
    "the final term in equation ( 12 ) is the approximate drag force on the bubble where @xmath92 is the density in the ambient cooling flow and @xmath93 is a dimensionless coefficient of order unity that depends on the shape of the bubble and other imponderables ; we assume @xmath94 .",
    "since the cooling flow is highly subsonic , hydrostatic equilibrium is a good approximation , @xmath95 , and the bubble velocity follows from archimedes principle , @xmath96^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath97    the collective drag interactions of a multitude of rising bubbles exerts an outward force on the cooling flow so the effective gravity becomes @xmath98 typically , @xmath39 differs from @xmath45 by @xmath99 percent .",
    "the energy transmitted from the bubbles to the surrounding gas is of particular interest for the cooling flow problem since the observed temperatures are always lowest at the center ( as in equation 9 ) .",
    "this observation indicates that most of the x - ray emitting gas near the flow center is not being strongly heated even when heating is required to account for the absence of further cooling .",
    "the nature of the energy exchange between the bubbles and the flow is not well understood .",
    "several authors ( brggen & kaiser 2002 ; churazov et al .",
    "2002 begelman 2001 ; brggen 2003b ) have suggested that cooling flows are heated by the @xmath20 work expended as bubbles expand during their ascent in the flow . while some @xmath20 heating by bubbles may occur during the transient adjustment when bubbles first move into a region of the flow devoid of bubbles ,",
    "it is less obvious that strong @xmath20 heating is expected in steady state flows where the filling factors of the bubbles and flow remain constant at every radius , i.e. @xmath100 . in steady flow as expanding bubbles rise subsonically upward into a spherical shell of interbubble gas , the volume of interbubble gas in that shell has already been reduced to accommodate the expanded bubbles ; this volume adjustment is contained in the filling factor @xmath29 for that shell",
    ". since the bubbles move subsonically , the flow in the interbubble gas as it is rearranged at constant volume in the shell is also subsonic and therefore largely incompressible , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath20 heating is likely to depend on the filling factor in some complicated manner that we do not investigate here . in spite of these reservations",
    ", we consider the possibility that @xmath20 heating may be important .    in steady state a single rising bubble of increasing volume @xmath101 delivers @xmath20 power at a rate @xmath102 @xmath103 where we assume @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "multiplying by the space density of bubbles , @xmath106 , we find the power delivered to the inflowing gas by all bubbles , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the uncertain efficiency that the expanding bubbles heat the gas locally .",
    "regardless of the uncertain relevance of @xmath20 heating , the cooling inflow is certainly heated by the drag interaction with the counterstreaming bubbles .",
    "the drag - related power generated by a single bubble is the product of the drag force and the relative velocity @xmath109 .",
    "the local density of bubbles is @xmath110 so the collective power density produced by all bubbles is @xmath111 .",
    "the bubbles could heat the surrounding gas by producing ( weak ) shocks or turbulence that dissipates locally .",
    "non - local heating could result if the energy received from bubbles was in the form of sound waves , gravity waves or long - lived turbulence .",
    "since the fraction of this energy that goes into local heating is unknown , we include a heating efficiency factor @xmath112 in the power density .",
    "the heating efficiency of rising bubbles is discussed by churazov et al .",
    "bubble - flow drag interactions heat the gas at a rate @xmath113    bubble heating can be included in the flow equations by replacing the radiative cooling coefficient @xmath64 in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) with @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116      the essential and necessary condition for steady state circulation requires that the rate of cooling mass inflow @xmath5 is balanced at every radius by a proportional upstream mass flow @xmath5 carried by the bubbles , @xmath117 so that @xmath118    the luminosity expended by agn heating at radius @xmath21 , @xmath119 @xmath120 can be produced by accretion onto the central black hole with mass flow @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the efficiency that the accreted mass converts to energy .",
    "combining these expressions , @xmath123 since @xmath124 , only a negligible flow into the hole can provide the necessary heating at @xmath21 so the mass flux in both radial directions in the flow beyond @xmath21 must exactly balance at every radius ( equation 18 ) .",
    "counterstreaming flow solutions are found by iteratively solving equations ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 19 ) .",
    "we begin with a bubble - free flow as in figure 1 , then calculate the dynamics of the bubbles required to carry the same @xmath5 .",
    "the total volume of the bubbles at each radius provides an estimate of the filling factor @xmath29 , which can then used to update the ( iterative ) solution for the inflowing gas .",
    "the iteration of the two point boundary problem for the cooling inflow ( equations 4 and 5 ) is embedded within the global iterative scheme involving the bubble dynamics .",
    "for simplicity we fix the inner radius @xmath21 of the circulation for all calculations , but the outer radius @xmath22 is free to vary as required by the solution . with each bubble - flow iteration ,",
    "the radius of the circulation flow @xmath22 is determined as that radius where the entropy of the rising bubbles equals that in the cooling inflow ; the cooling flow density is then renormalized to the local density of ngc 4472 at @xmath22 . at @xmath125",
    "the density and temperature inside the bubbles naturally become the same as those in the local flow , and the bubbles merge with the cooling flow .",
    "the outward velocity of the bubbles at @xmath22 and the inward velocity of the cooling flow gas are both very small and highly subsonic at @xmath22 , but never exactly zero ; we assume that this small differential velocity is dissipated without appreciably altering the local entropy . as before ,",
    "the temperature profile of the interbubble flow and its end - point values @xmath78 and @xmath126 are completely determined by the requirement that the gas density match that observed in ngc 4472 at @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    for a rigorously consistent solution",
    "the global mass flow rate @xmath5 should be redetermined from equation ( 10 ) ( using the computed flow ) for each value of @xmath22 as it changes during the iterative calculation .",
    "however , we have found that this requirement is not essential for overall convergence and for simplicity we have decided to relax this additional constraint , keeping both @xmath61 kpc and @xmath70 @xmath47 yr@xmath10 constant for all solutions . for given @xmath5 and @xmath21 ,",
    "the important parameters for each circulation flow are the heating factor @xmath127 , the bubble mass @xmath82 and the heating efficiencies @xmath108 and @xmath112 of the bubbles .",

    "successful solutions must satisfy several additional conditions : ( 1 ) the bubble radius must not exceed the local radius in the flow , ( 2 ) the bubbles must not fill the entire volume and choke off the inflowing gas , and ( 3 ) the mass of the bubbles must be sufficient to carry the outward mass flux @xmath5 .",

    "two circulation flows are shown in figure 2 for each assumed bubble mass @xmath82 , one with a typical value @xmath127 and one near the largest @xmath151 for which solutions are physically possible or appropriate .",
    "each solution in figure 2 shows the cooling inflow variables @xmath152 , @xmath15 and @xmath153 with solid curves . in the density panels",
    "the solid curves begin and end on the observed density profile for ngc 4472 , which is shown with dotted lines in the top row of panels .",

    "the dashed lines in these bottom panels show the variation of the inflow volume filling factor @xmath29 .",
    "as @xmath127 approaches the highest possible value for each bubble mass @xmath82 , @xmath158 , the bubbles nearly fill the entire available volume at @xmath21 where @xmath159 , as explained by condition ( 21 ) .",
    "for the most massive bubbles considered , @xmath160 @xmath47 , solutions for two heating parameters are shown , @xmath161 and 6 for which the circulation radii are @xmath62 and 25 kpc respectively .",
    "the density , temperature and velocity profiles for the cooling inflows for these two solutions are almost identical .",
    "we have not considered larger values of @xmath127 because the bubble velocity @xmath88 for the @xmath162 solution approaches the sound speed in the cooling flow @xmath163 km s@xmath10 .",
    "larger @xmath127 would result in supersonic bubble velocities that would drive shocks into the cooling gas , dramatically increasing its temperature .",
    "also the bubble size at @xmath21 for the @xmath162 solution , @xmath164 kpc is comparable to @xmath21 , again arguing against larger values of @xmath127 .",

    "the circulation with @xmath166 extends out to @xmath167 kpc , but the flow filling factor @xmath149 is less than about 0.1 at @xmath21 so there are no circulations with @xmath168 ( condition 21 ) . in order for this marginal flow to support mass flux @xmath5 , the relative flow @xmath169 must increase as @xmath170 and the drag increases accordingly .",
    "the bubble velocity @xmath88 is seen to decline toward @xmath21 . as a result of the large drag , the effective gravity @xmath39 ( equation 15 )",
    "is directed outward near @xmath61 kpc where the flow would be rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "this region of instability becomes larger for higher values of @xmath127 . because of the approximations we have made , the density in the flow region @xmath171 is somewhat higher than the density observed in ngc 4472 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "however , if this flow were observed , the apparent density @xmath172 would be lowered since the flow only occupies a fraction @xmath149 of the volume , i.e. , @xmath173 .",

    "the flow filling factor @xmath149 is dropping rapidly as @xmath170 for the @xmath175 solution so this is close to the maximum possible heating ( and @xmath22 ) for these smaller bubbles .",
    "we were unable to achieve fully convergent flow solutions with even smaller bubbles of mass @xmath176 @xmath47 .",
    "while our search for such solutions was not exhaustive , it is apparent from the trend in panels _ k _ @xmath177 _ g _ @xmath177 _ c _ in figure 2 that the maximum values of @xmath88 , @xmath127 and @xmath22 all decrease with @xmath82 , as expected from condition ( 22 ) .",
    "bubbles of mass @xmath174 @xmath47 are approaching the minimum @xmath82 necessary to carry the cooling mass flow @xmath5 for any heating @xmath80 .",
    "non - circulating flows with bubbles of lower mass must ultimately cool radiatively to temperatures much lower than @xmath78 , in disagreement with xmm observations .",
    "one of the motivations for our exploration of non - cooling circulation flows is to estimate the influence of the bubbles on the apparent gas temperature which typically has a minimum near the origin . to simulate the apparent temperature that would be inferred when viewing the cooling inflow and the hot rising bubbles along the same line of sight , we calculated the local emission - weighted temperature @xmath178 which is plotted as dotted lines for each of the flows in panels _ b _ , _ f _ and _ j _ of figure 2 . for most",
    "circulation flows @xmath179 is nearly indistinguishable from the temperature of the cooling flow component .",
    "consequently , a single phase interpretation of the temperature profile would show a mildly positive gradient , @xmath6 , similar to those observed and consistent with traditional cooling flows .",
    "this is a desirable feature of the circulation model . only for the least massive bubbles considered , @xmath174 @xmath47 ,",
    "does @xmath179 rise slightly as @xmath170 , but the differential change in the temperature profile caused by the hot bubbles is small .",
    "the apparent density @xmath180 and entropy profiles are also similar to those of the cooling flow component alone . we stress that these results differ from normal convection where ( 1 ) there is a single temperature and density at every radius ( apart from fluctuations ) , ( 2 ) the temperature gradient is determined by the gravitational potential , @xmath181 , and therefore has a sign opposite to that observed , and ( 3 ) the entropy is constant .      the ratio of @xmath20 heating to drag heating is @xmath182 where @xmath183 and we use @xmath184 cm s@xmath185 which is appropriate for @xmath186 in ngc 4472 .",
    "the result @xmath187 follows immediately from equation ( 13 ) provided @xmath183 . in view of the uncertain physical nature of these two comparable bubble - flow heating mechanisms",
    ", we consider heating due to bubble expansion and drag separately .",
    "figure 3 illustrates four representative cooling flow models in which the work done by the drag force is assumed to heat the local cooling flow gas with various efficiencies @xmath112 ( and @xmath188 ) . as before @xmath70",
    "@xmath47 yr@xmath10 and @xmath61 kpc for all flows",
    ". the four flows also have the same bubble mass @xmath165 @xmath47 and heating factor @xmath162 , but the bubble drag heating efficiency has values @xmath189 , 0.1 , 0.3 and 0.7 .",
    "flows with progressively higher @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 near the heating radius @xmath21 correspond to increasing efficiencies .",
    "by contrast , the circulation radii , velocities , filling factors and bubble radii are insensitive to the heating efficiency .    however , the flow with the largest heating efficiency , @xmath193 is less satisfactory because flow temperature and particularly the apparent temperature @xmath194 develop appreciable negative radial gradients near @xmath21 . because of this rise in the flow temperatures , bubbles heated with the same @xmath127 rise to higher temperatures .",
    "in addition , when @xmath193 the density gradient develops an unstable positive density gradient within about 2 kpc . from these and",
    "other circulation flows with nonzero @xmath112 we conclude that the apparent temperature has no undesirable radial gradients as long as @xmath195 ; this is a reasonable constraint in view of the uncertain nature of the bubble - flow heating process .",
    "figure 4 shows three flows assumed to be heated only by bubble expansion with efficiencies @xmath196 0.5 and 0.7 ( and @xmath189 ) . as before , the apparent emission - weighted temperature profiles ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "4b ) become strongly negative unless @xmath197 .",
    "our primary objective in constructing these models is to explore the possibility that cooling flow gas can be heated at some small radius in such a manner that ( 1 ) no gas cools to very low temperatures and ( 2 ) the apparent temperature gradient of the cooling flow does not become negative in the central regions .",
    "we have demonstrated that flows satisfying these two criteria are indeed possible . with appropriately chosen parameters , buoyant bubbles can carry the cooling flow mass @xmath5 away from the core with velocities sufficiently large that the apparent ( emission - weighted ) temperature gradient @xmath198 is virtually unaffected by the hot gas inside the bubbles .",
    "in addition , the local interbubble gas can be heated by the bubbles with up to 25  50 percent efficiency without adversely disturbing the temperature gradient .",
    "this positive assessment of idealized circulation flows contrasts with the less satisfactory results of our numerical simulations in which all cooling flows that were sufficiently heated to noticeably reduce the central cooling @xmath5 also resulted in strongly negative apparent temperature gradients ( brighenti & mathews 2002 ; 2003 )",
    ".    however , the bubble return model clearly fails if the bubbles are too small .",
    "as @xmath82 decreases , the large number of bubbles required to transport @xmath5 ( particularly near the central heating source at @xmath21 ) consumes all the available volume , entirely displacing the cooling inflow ( condition 21 ) . in these circumstances",
    "the heated central region would grow in size and would almost certainly result in an extended hot thermal core and @xmath199 , which is not generally observed in x - rays .",
    "the circulation flows we consider do not specify the physical nature of the heating process interior to the heating radius @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , if the bubbles are heated too slowly , there is some concern that emission from @xmath200 could result in negative apparent @xmath198 and this would need to be considered in a more detailed model .",
    "we have found that the problems of bubble congestion near @xmath21 and emission within @xmath21 can not be alleviated by increasing the radius @xmath21 at which heating occurs .",
    "finally , bubbles of low mass also experience more drag , move more slowly and , if @xmath82 is too small , can fail to transport the mass arriving in the cooling inflow ( equation 22 ) .",
    "these difficulties with small bubbles clearly raise concerns about the possible fragmentation of larger bubbles . however , at the x - ray resolution of the observations we have so far , the bubble - like disturbances have sizes @xmath201 that are consistent with those required in our circulation flows .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the x - ray images showing bubbles and surface brightness fluctuations are rather similar on all scales , from elliptical galaxies to clusters like perseus .",
    "the azimuthally random character of bubble or density fluctuations at all radii in the hot gas also seems to be rather universal .",
    "the azimuthally random orientation of bubbles may be difficult to explain with numerical simulations in which energy is deposited by a fixed jet ; the jet orientation would need to change rapidly due to precession or other similar black hole disturbances .",
    "finally , the x - ray data so far indicates that the strong ( or complete ) reduction in the cooling rate @xmath5 occurs universally in all hot gas flows , whereas only a small ( but extensively observed ) fraction of these flows contain powerful jet - like radio sources .",
    "circulation flows are also limited in spatial extent , and this limitation becomes particularly acute as the bubble mass decreases .",
    "in all the galaxy - scale circulation flows that we considered , the circulation radius @xmath22 is limited to @xmath202 kpc which may be comparable to observed regions having a multi - temperature spectrum .",
    "for example in ngc 5044 buote et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find evidence of significant temperature fluctuations out to @xmath18 kpc .",
    "although small bubbles are disadvantageous for a variety of reasons , there is no obvious mechanism that favors the production of larger bubbles or guarantees that larger bubbles do not fragment .",
    "this must be viewed as an essential shortcoming of cooling flows with bubble return and the notion that @xmath5 is small or zero because of agn heating .",
    "while it is likely that the circulation radius @xmath22 can be increased beyond @xmath203 kpc if the bubbles are supported with cosmic rays or magnetic fields , such bubbles may be unable to carry the requisite @xmath5 away from the heated core .    in our circulation flows , the kinetic energy and momentum of the rising bubbles",
    "is derived ultimately from the gravitational field and some of this energy and momentum is transported to the surrounding gas .",
    "the momentum exchange reduces the velocity of inflowing gas , and may be analogous to the entrainment of local gas in many of the numerical simulations of individual large bubbles reviewed in section 2 .",
    "bubbles can directly heat the surrounding gas if they thermally dissolve into the interbubble gas before reaching the radius @xmath204 of equal entropy . while we do not consider such thermal mixing here",
    ", it would almost certainly heat the interbubble flow and result in unfavorable apparent temperature gradients .",
    "some limited heating of the interbubble gas by adiabatic bubbles  either by drag or @xmath20 mechanical heating or by entropy mixing  may account for the enhanced non - gravitational entropy observed in galaxy groups ( e.g. ponman et al .",
    "however , the efficiency ( @xmath112 and @xmath108 ) of such distributed heating would need to be fine - tuned to be consistent with the flow of both mass and entropy to large radii as required in circulation flow models and to satisfy observational constraints on the apparent temperature profile @xmath205 .",
    "the idealized circulation flows we describe here could be extended to include cooling inflow from @xmath23 , constant mass loss from stars , bubble fragmentation , cosmic ray pressure in the bubbles , a range of heating factors @xmath127 for the bubbles , bubble - flow thermalization , and a distribution of bubble masses @xmath82 in each flow .",
    "it seems likely however that the filling factor and mass flow constraints ( equations 21 and 22 ) must still be valid for any flow in which all or most of the mass flow @xmath5 is carried outward by heated regions .",
    "it is likely that our less complicated circulation flows contain essential features that are generic to all centrally heated flows designed to greatly reduce the cooling rate @xmath5 .",
    "the idealized circulation flows we describe here could only apply for a limited time because of secular increase in the gas mass as new gas enters the circulating region .",
    "for example , if all the gas ejected from evolving red giant stars merges into the hot phase , the characteristic time for the hot gas density to increase appreciably in ngc 4472 is @xmath206 gyr where @xmath207 sec@xmath10 is the current specific rate of stellar mass loss .",
    "moreover , in many galaxy / group scale cooling flows , including ngc 4472 , the hot gas extends far beyond the circulation radii @xmath22 we calculate here .",
    "therefore , the cooling inflow of gas crossing radius @xmath22 provides another secular increase in the mass of gas in the circulation region . as the mass of circulating gas slowly increases , the circulation flow @xmath5 is also expected to increase and the amount of heating @xmath127 must decrease to maintain the circulation .",
    "ultimately , a cooling event is expected ( equation 22 ) . when the central @xmath5 is strongly reduced in our numerical simulations of centrally heated cooling flows",
    ", the flow cools episodically at larger radii in the flow ( brighenti & mathews 2002 ; 2003 ) .",
    "it remains to be determined if intermittent cooling events can agree with the x - ray observations , but the observations we have so far are consistent with no cooling at all .",
    "finally , the hot bubbles also carry type ia supernovae ( snia ) iron enrichment out to @xmath22 , broadening the iron abundance profile relative to the stars , which agrees qualitatively with observations . the iron from snia acts like tracer particles that can reveal the direction and magnitude of the radial flow of hot gas ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
