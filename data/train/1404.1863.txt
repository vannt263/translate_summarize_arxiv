    "the authors studied spectral measures associated to the compact lie groups @xmath1 and @xmath3 and their maximal tori , nimrep graphs associated to the @xmath2 and @xmath4 modular invariants , and the mckay graphs for finite subgroups of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , using braided subfactor theory .",

    "it is a simply connected , compact , real rank two lie group of dimension 14 and is the smallest of the exceptional lie groups .",
    "it is isomorphic to the subgroup of @xmath9 that fixes any particular vector in its 8-dimensional real spinor representation .",
    "we determine spectral measures and joint spectral measures for ( the adjacency matrices of ) various graphs related to the lie group @xmath0 : the mckay ( or representation ) graphs for the irreducible representations of @xmath0 and its maximal torus @xmath10 , nimrep graphs or fusion modules associated to the @xmath0 modular invariants , and in the sequel @xcite , the mckay graphs for finite subgroups of @xmath0 .",

    "this approach is described as a spectral measure blowup in @xcite . in the case of @xmath0 , the maximal torus @xmath10 has dimension one greater than the spectrum @xmath17 , so that there is a loss of dimension when passing from the measure @xmath26 to @xmath15 .",

    "in fact , one can identify the spectrum @xmath31 with its image @xmath33 in @xmath34 , since the map @xmath35 is continuous and injective , and hence a homeomorphism since @xmath31 is compact @xcite . in the case",
    "where the operators @xmath16 , @xmath28 act on a finite - dimensional hilbert space , this is the set of all pairs of real numbers @xmath36 for which there exists a non - zero vector @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",

    "since the nimreps are a family of commuting matrices , they can be simultaneously diagonalised and thus the eigenvectors @xmath77 are the same for the nimrep graphs @xmath75 for all @xmath71 .",
    "we have @xmath78 , where the summation is over each @xmath57 with multiplicity given by the modular invariant , i.e. the spectrum of @xmath75 is given by @xmath79 with multiplicity @xmath80 .",
