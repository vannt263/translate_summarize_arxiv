    "the study of relativistic radiating stellar models has been extensive since the presentation of the junction conditions required for the smooth matching of the interior stellar medium to the external atmosphere represented by vaidya s outgoing solution@xcite .",
    "earlier models focussed on shear - free collapse with various assumptions on the internal matter distribution ranging from collapse from an initial static configuration , vanishing of weyl stresses in the interior and imposing a barotropic equation in the core material . also the effects of bulk viscosity , anisotropic pressures , cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field have been studied@xcite .",
    "these ` toy ' models provide a rich insight into the physics at play during the collapse process , and they have helped investigators understand the dynamical nature of dissipation .",

    "2 shows that relaxational effects predict a higher temperature than its noncausal counterpart .",
    "the interesting feature in our investigation is the enhancement of the relaxational effects brought about by the inclusion of shear .",
    "we can understand the increased temperature within the stellar core on the basis that the shear is responsible for the internal friction between the layers of the stellar fluid .",
    "this interaction between the layers at each interior point of the collapsing body leads to the generation of heat within the core .",
    "furthermore , we expect the generation of heat due to friction to be more pronounced closer to the centre of the star as the density and pressure here are maximum . fig .",
    "3 illustrates the trend in the luminosity at infinity as a function of time . for our particular model ,",
    "the luminosity is independent of time in the shear - free limit .",
    "this implies that in the shear - free model the horizon is never encountered . in this case",
    "the rate of energy dissipation is equal to the collapse rate of the core .",
    "similar models were studied by banerjee _ et al _ @xcite , naidu and govender@xcite and maharaj _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "3 shows that the luminosity increases as the shear increases .",
    "we note that in our model there is no direct link between the luminosity and the product @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the shear viscosity coefficient .",
    "the trend in the luminosity profile in relation to the shear can be understood in terms of the deviations from a shear - free profile .",
    "it has been shown that the scalar function@xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the proper radial derivative , @xmath103 is the proper time derivative , @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the mass function measures the stability of the shear - free condition .",
    "it is quite clear that even in the absence of shear viscosity ( if we ignore the internal friction between the layers of the collapsing fluid ) there can be an increase in the absolute value of the shear scalar due to the presence of density inhomogeneity and heat flux . fig .",
    "4 shows the behaviour of the relaxation time as a function of the radial coordinate .",
    "the relaxation time for the shear stress exhibits substantially different behaviour when the fluid is close to hydrostatic equilibrium as opposed to late - time collapse .",
    "in particular , our results confirm earlier findings by naidu _",
    "et al_@xcite in which they showed that @xmath106 in their model , the acceleration vanishes and the particle trajectories are geodesics .",
    "our work has clearly demonstrated the impact of shear on observable properties of a radiating , collapsing star .",
    "we were able to achieve this because our model allows us to switch off the shear and compare the physics in both the shearing and shear - free limits .",
    "in addition , figure 5 shows that the collapse rate at the boundary of the star is higher in the shearing model as compared to its shear - free counterpart .",
    "the opposite trend is observed at the centre of the collapsing star , ie . , the collapse rate in the presence of shear is lower than the collapse rate in the shear - free case as evidenced in figure 6 .",
    "it is well known that shear - free collapse proceeds at the slowest possible rate@xcite .",
    "figures 5 and 6 imply that shear is directly responsible for the evolution of energy density inhomogeneities as the fluid collapses . from ( [ ytf ] )",
    "we see that energy density inhomogeneity is responsible for deviations from an initially shear - free profile .",
    "these deviations can be enhanced in the presence of heat dissipation within the stellar core .",
    "the role of energy density inhomogeneity during dissipative collapse was highlighted by herrera @xcite in which it was shown that the factors responsible for the generation of energy density inhomogeneities depends on the nature of the fluid distribution .",
    "our results confirm the findings of herrera in that both shear and dissipative fluxes ( in our case heat flow ) lead to the generation of energy density inhomogeneities .",
    "it has been shown that sufficiently dominant shearing effects in the neighbourhood of the singularity can delay the formation of the apparent horizon@xcite .",
    "this dispersive effect of shear can lead to the singularity being exposed to an external observer .",
    "utilising a solution recently discovered by thirukannesh _ et al_@xcite which describes a radiating sphere undergoing dissipative collapse we were able to clearly demonstrate the effect of shear on observable quantities such as the temperature and luminosity profiles .",
    "the simple nature of this particular exact solution allows the shear to be switched off which makes it possible ( for the first time ) to compare the dynamics of the collapse process both in the shearing and shear - free limits .",
    "we are able to show that the shear leads to an enhancement of the temperature at each interior point of the collapsing body .",
    "for the first time , we are able to show that relaxational effects are pronounced in the presence of shear .",
    "these effects are strengthened during late stages of gravitational collapse .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate the physics of a radiating star undergoing dissipative collapse in the form of a radial heat flux . </S>",
    "<S> our treatment clearly demonstrates how the presence of shear affects the collapse process ; we are in a position to contrast the physical features of the collapsing sphere in the presence of shear with the shear - free case . by employing a causal heat transport equation of the maxwell - cattaneo form </S>",
    "<S> we show that the shear leads to an enhancement of the core temperature thus emphasizing that relaxational effects can not be ignored when the star leaves hydrostatic equilibrium . </S>"
