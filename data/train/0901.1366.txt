    "surface and nanometrical objects are important both for their possible implementation in the current technology and from basic research point of view . in collinear magnetic thin films intriguing behavior , as transition temperature depending from the film thickness @xmath4 or critical exponent crossover , were observed @xcite .    nowadays , the most fervent interest has moved towards frustrated systems , where a non - collinear order , characterized by a possibly large modulation , is established . some rare - earth elements",
    "( as holmium , dysprosium or terbium ) and their compounds are typical examples that the nature makes available to investigate such peculiar behaviours , in view of the variety of magnetic arrangements , as helix , spiral or longitudinal - wave , that can be observed in bulk samples of such materials.@xcite",
    ". further examples of helicoidal structures can also be met in multiferroic materials@xcite and itinerant systems , as mnsi @xcite and fege @xcite .    in magnetic systems with frustration ,",
    "the lack of translational invariance due to the presence of surfaces can result especially important for ultra - thin film samples where the thickness is comparable , or even lower , with the wave length of the ordered magnetic structure observed in the bulk .",
    "it is worthwhile observing that when these conditions are met a sweeping change of the magnetic structure behaviour could be found .",
    "many fundamental features related to such systems have not yet been exhaustively investigated and completely understood , and ultra - thin films of rare - earth elements are still among the most intriguing layered systems to be studied@xcite .    from an experimental point of view , the availability of new sophisticated growth and characterization techniques@xcite has allowed to extensively investigate the properties of such magnetic nano - structures .",
    "for instance , interesting experimental data on thin films of holmium ( whose bulk samples show helical order along the @xmath5 axis , perpendicular to film basal planes ) were obtained @xcite by neutron diffraction and resonant soft x - ray experiments . by looking at the static structure factor @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the wave vector of the incommensurate magnetic modulation along the film growth direction @xmath8 )",
    ", it has been shown that the critical behaviour of holmium thin films markedly differ from that of films of transition metals , which usually display a collinear ferromagnetic ( fm ) or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order in the bulk .",
    "mainly , the authors of refs .   identified a thickness @xmath9 mono - layers [ ml ] ( comparable with the helix pitch of bulk holmium @xmath10ml ) which was interpreted as a lower bound for the presence of the helical ordered phase . in fact , they observed that the transition temperature dependence on film thickness does not follow the usual asymptotic power law @xcite , but rather an empirical relation @xmath11 can be devised @xcite , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the ordering temperature of the bulk system and of a film with thickness @xmath1 , respectively , while the exponent @xmath14 has not an universal character .",
    "interesting enough , it appears that this empirical relation is not peculiar of helical - like structures only but it results more general , being observed in other ultra - thin structures characterized by a magnetic modulation as well : an important example is given by chromium films , where at low temperatures an incommensurate spin density wave is present @xcite .",
    "a mean field approximation ( mfa ) was proposed in refs .   and in order to understand the experimental outcomes from holmium films : mfa allowed to obtain a first , rough estimate of the threshold thickness @xmath15 defined in the empirical relation  , but it also revealed that for thicknesses close enough to @xmath15 the paramagnetic and helical phase can be accompanied by a more complex block phase , where groups of ferromagnetically ordered layers pile - up in an alternating antiferromagnetic arrangement along the c axis . as it is well known , the mfa completely neglects thermal fluctuations , which are however strongly expected to play a fundamental role in the critical behaviour of low - dimensional magnetic systems : therefore , adding thermal fluctuations not only give strong quantitative adjustments of the mfa estimates of critical quantities as @xmath13 or @xmath15 , but could also make unstable some ordered structure as the block phase met above .    in order to overcome such issues and deepen our understanding of critical phenomena in holmium ultra - thin films , we performed extensive classical monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) : preliminary results already showed @xcite that thermal fluctuations do not destroy the block phase , which instead acquire a much richer structure , with disordered inner layers intercalating ordered ones and undergoing a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase transition@xcite as the temperature lowers .",
    "a complete account is here given of the results of our simulations for film thickness in the range @xmath16ml .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we shall briefly recall relevant properties of holmium , and introduce the magnetic model hamiltonian . sec .",
    "[ mcm ] is devoted to describe the monte carlo method and the estimators employed to evaluate the physical quantities relevant for magnetic films with non - collinear order . in sec .",

    "[ fluctu ] : in particular , sec .  [ planes ] will report a detailed study of the temperature regions where the single layers display a critical behaviour , the structure factor close to these regions being deeply analyzed too , given its fundamental relevance in an experimental mindset ; sec .",
    "[ gfp ] will be devoted to the global film properties .",
    "all the results reported in the previous sections will be compared and discussed in an unifying framework in sec .",
    "[ disc ] , where we shall also gather our conclusions .",
    "the magnetic properties of holmium have been intensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the bulk crystal structures is known to be hexagonal close - packed ( _ hcp _ ) .",
    "the indirect exchange among the localized _",
    "4f _ electrons manifests as an rkky long - range interaction of atomic magnetic moments ; the experimental data about the low - temperature magnetic moments arrangement in ho can be reproduced assuming a fm interaction between nearest neighbor spins lying on the _ ab _ crystallographic planes@xcite , while along the _ c _ crystallographic axis interactions up to the sixth neighboring layers must be allowed for ( see for example ref .  ) .",
    "it s just the competing nature of the latter that below @xmath17k gives rise to an incommensurate magnetic periodic structure , which can be modeled as an helical arrangement of the magnetic moment vectors along the direction ( henceforth denoted as _ z _ ) parallel to _ c _ , i.e. perpendicular to the _ ab _ crystallographic planes , where the magnetic vectors prefer to lye as a consequence of a single - ion easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "the average local spin vector at low temperature can thus be expressed as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the helical pitch vector , and @xmath20 , _ c _ being the lattice constant @xcite along the _ z _ direction ( i.e. , @xmath21 is the distance between nearest neighbouring _ ab _ spin layers ) . in addition , the crystal field bring into play other different kinds of anisotropies that , at temperatures well below @xmath12 , are able to change the helical shapes in conical ones , or force the magnetic structures in a _ bunched helix _ which is commensurate with the lattice @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations have shown that incommensurate magnetic bulk structures ( observed , besides holmium , also in other rare - earth elements , as dysprosium and terbium ) can be well obtained by a mfa @xcite from a simple heisenberg model with only three coupling constant , the first one , @xmath22 , describing the fm in - plane interactions , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the effective coupling between ions on neighbouring ( nn ) and next - neighbouring ( nnn ) planes , respectively . whatever the sign of @xmath23 , the mfa finds a helical structure when @xmath25 , i.e. afm , and the conditions @xmath26 is met .",
    "is the total number of spins , @xmath1 is the film thickness , i.e. the number of spin layer ( free boundary conditions are taken along @xmath8-direction ) , and @xmath27 are the layer dimensions ( periodic boundary conditions are applied along @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions ) . * ( a ) * schematic representation of _ hcp _ ho structure and exchange interactions : only @xmath30 ( in - plane , green lines ) , @xmath23 ( nn planes , red lines ) , @xmath24 ( nnn planes , blue line ) , and @xmath31 ( cyan lines ) are represented .",
    "the numerical values of the coupling constants employed in our simulations are : @xmath32k , @xmath33k , @xmath34k , @xmath35k , @xmath36k , @xmath37k , @xmath38k.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    it is worthwhile to recall that when dealing with ultra - thin films the assumption of being allowed to retain the same hamiltonian able to describe the bulk structure is absolutely not guaranteed to be correct : indeed , real film samples can be strongly affected by defects , strain , thickness uncertainty ( @xmath392 ml ) or interaction with the substrate @xcite ( typically y / nb or w(110 ) )",
    ". the latter can be particularly relevant , as it can change , sometimes dramatically , the single ion anisotropy and the strength of the interaction constants with respect to bulk samples .",
    "furthermore , the lack of inversion symmetry can bring into play the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite ( see for instance ref .   and for perovskite multiferroic rmno@xmath40 with r",
    "= gd , tb , or dy ) and possible surface anisotropies for dy / y multilayer films @xcite .    while always remembering such possible drawbacks , in our investigation of ho thin films we employ a heisenberg model hamiltonian which has proven useful to describe holmium bulk samples .",
    "we thus define : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total number of magnetic ions , @xmath43 being the lateral film dimensions and @xmath1 the number of layers ( see fig .",
    "[ hcplatt]a ) , and @xmath44 are classical unitary vectors representing the total angular momentum of ho ions ( i.e. @xmath45 ) . as a consequence",
    ", the magnitude of the angular momentum of ho ions is embodied in our definition of the coupling constants appearing in eq .",
    "as @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .",
    "for the inter - layer exchange parameters @xmath48 we have assumed the values given in ref .  , while the easy plane anisotropy @xmath49k @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ hcplatt]b we show a schematic representation of the _ hcp _ lattice structure and of the exchange interactions included in the model hamiltonian  . on the hexagonal basal planes only a nn , fm interaction @xmath22 ( green lines ) is considered ; along the @xmath5-axis we instead allow for interactions up to the sixth neighboring layer , with a total coordination number @xmath50 .",
    "sign and magnitude of the out - of - plane interaction constants j@xmath51 ... j@xmath52 were determined in ref .   in order to reproduce , with the correct pitch vector , the helical ground state along the _ c_-axis observed in the experimental data . however , at the best of our knowledge , also neutron scattering experiments investigated the dynamical properties of holmium only along the @xmath5-axis @xcite , so that a direct measure of the in plane fm coupling constant is still lacking , and only mean field estimates are available , which set it at about 300@xmath53ev @xcite .",
    "this allows us to consider j@xmath54 as an almost free fit parameter to be adjusted in order to fix the correct value of experimentally accessible quantities . by monte carlo simulations we find the value @xmath55k for the bulk ordering temperature by setting j@xmath56@xmath53ev : bearing in mind the cautions",
    "given above about the possible quantitative difference among bulk and film samples , this is the value of j@xmath54 we have used in all the following simulations of thin films , without attempting any further possibly meaningless quantitative adjustment .",
    "our study of the magnetic properties of thin rare earth films was done by extensive classical mcs . thickness _",
    "n _ from 6 to 36 and lateral dimensions @xmath57 have been analyzed .",
    "as we are working on film structures , free boundary conditions in the thickness direction @xmath8 are obviously taken , while the usual periodic boundary conditions are applied in the @xmath58 planes ( see fig .",
    "[ hcplatt]a ) , which coincide both with the _ ab _ crystallographic planes and the easy plane for the magnetization .",
    "simulations were done at different temperatures ; the thermodynamic equilibrium is reached by the usual metropolis algorithm @xcite and over - relaxed technique @xcite .",
    "the latter was employed in order to speed - up the sampling of the whole spin configuration space : indeed , the competitive nature of the exchange interactions in the hamiltonian   and the high coordination number lead to a long time needed to reach thermal equilibrium , especially in the critical region .",
    "we have thus resorted to a judicious mix of metropolis and over - relaxed moves in order to reach the goal in a reasonable time .",
    "usually , one `` monte carlo step '' is composed by one metropolis and four / five over - relaxed moves per particle , discarding up to 5@xmath5910@xmath60 monte carlo steps for thermal equilibration ; at least three independent simulations where done for for each temperature .",
    "the monte carlo data analysis have benefited from the employment of the multiple histogram technique @xcite , which allows us to estimate the physical observables of interest over a whole temperature range by interpolating the results obtained from simulations performed at some chosen , different temperatures .",
    "the outcome of the method is an estimate of the density of state @xmath61 at energy @xmath62 obtained by weighting the contributes @xmath63 due to independent simulations made at inverse temperature @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the independent simulations have to be sufficiently close in temperature , i.e. the temperature step must be chosen roughly proportional to the square root of the inverse of the heat capacity @xcite .",
    "we thus have computed the partition function @xmath66 at any @xmath67 in the range of interest by solving iteratively the equation @xmath68^{-1 } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the number of independent samples of energy for the @xmath71-simulation .",
    "the index @xmath72 refers again to the single simulation , while @xmath73 denotes the energy sampling intervals in the @xmath72-th simulation .",
    "as mentioned above , the high number of exchange interactions makes difficult the estimate of the density of state , especially close to the critical temperature , and variables like specific heat or susceptibility are extremely sensitive for these systems . anyway , this obstacle has been successfully overcome making use of the estimator , @xmath74 in the histogram reweighting techniques , as suggested in ref .. iterating several times the multiple - histogram algorithm , we have also obtained the variance of the interpolated data by bootstrap resampled method , by picking out randomly a sizable number of independent measurements @xmath70 ( between 1 and 5@xmath5910@xmath75 ) , and iterating the re - sampling at least one hundred times @xcite .    as we are interested in the phase transitions of holmium films , it is worthwhile to observe that the study of films described by the hamiltonian   entails a wide number of fundamental issues . first of all we must consider : _",
    "i ) _ the intrinsically two - dimensional ( 2d ) nature of such magnetic structures ; _ ii ) _ the presence of different interactions , which turn out to be fm on the layers ( with a so(2 ) symmetry ) and competitive along the thickness direction _",
    "n _ , with a possible helimagnetic ( hm ) order at low temperature ( i.e. a @xmath76 @xmath59so(2 ) symmetry @xcite ) ; and _ iii ) _ the implementation of different boundary conditions for _ n _ and _",
    "l _ , respectively , above introduced .",
    "about the first issue , it is well known that the critical behaviour of an ideal easy - plane magnetic film with continuous symmetry and short - range fm ( or afm ) interactions pertains to the 2d xy universality class , displaying a kt behaviour @xcite at a finite critical temperature .",
    "in particular , a crossover from 3d to 2d behaviour is expected when the correlation length saturates the film thickness . however , from mcs point of view , it may result quite difficult to realize such conditions . indeed , even for large , but still finite , @xmath77 values a sharp transition can not be observed , making it possible to define a _",
    "3d pseudo critical point _ , as extensively discussed by janke and co - workers in refs .  .",
    "turning to the second issue , in a quasi-2d magnetic system with a continuous symmetry the introduction of competing interactions along the direction perpendicular to the film slab brings into play the presence of two ( in - plane and out - of - plane ) correlation lengths , with a rather dissimilar behaviour in the critical regime . as analyzed in ref .",
    ", under these conditions some new and interesting critical phenomena can be observed .",
    "systems with discrete symmetries which present two different correlation lengths were already discussed in literature , see , e.g. , refs .   and .    moving to the last issue",
    ", we must first of all observe that the identification of a suitable order parameter to study the critical properties of non - collinear thin films requires a careful analysis of some of their peculiar features .",
    "a first trouble is the intrinsic difficulty represented by a helical order parameter associated to a wave vector @xmath78 : in the bulk system the virtually infinite size of the system , summing up an _ infinite _ number of in - phase contributions , makes a clear peak emerge at wave - vector @xmath78 in the static structure factor in the ordered phase . in films ,",
    "the presence of broad peaks is on the contrary expected in a wide temperature range as , a consequence of the intrinsic finite size nature of the system , thus jeopardizing the identification of a well defined critical temperature @xmath13 from the sole analysis of the peaks appearing in the structure factor .",
    "secondly , as we will discuss in the next sections , a _ nave _",
    "structure factor analysis could be not enough to distinguish between an hm order and other ordered phases that can be present .",
    "for these reasons , it is necessary to resort to other observables related to the hm order .",
    "a first choice can be found in the chirality @xcite , which can be defined on film as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 labels the planes , starting from one of the two film surfaces , and @xmath72 locates the spin on the plane . as we shall see in the next sections @xmath81 represents quite a good quantity to locate the critical temperature for the hm phase",
    "in view of point _",
    "i ) _ discussed above , it is useful to introduce a fm order parameter for each layer @xmath80 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , and consequently the average order parameter of the film @xcite : @xmath85 it is worth to observe that the order signalled by the quantities defined in eq .   and do not directly entail the existence of an hm or fan structure in the film .",
    "the critical nature of the observables defined in eqs .",
    ", , and , is better revealed by looking at the following derived quantities ( @xmath86 ) : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 which , at the critical temperature , display a peak that can be characterized by the usual finite size scaling theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , for large enough @xmath77 , @xmath90 approximately scales as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is system dependent constant , while @xmath93 is the correlation length critical exponent .",
    "a final quantity we employ in our investigation of the critical properties of films is the binder cumulant @xcite : @xmath94 which allows us to locate the critical temperature by looking at the intersection of the graphs of @xmath95 as a function of @xmath96 obtained at different @xmath77 : at @xmath97 such crossing becomes a `` nontrivial fixed - point '' @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can examine the ratios @xmath98 ( for sizes @xmath77 and @xmath99 ) as temperature function , looking for a unitary ratio at the critical temperature .",
    "in this section we will present and analyze our monte carlo results for the overall magnetic behaviour of film samples of different thicknesses , from a bulk - like structure with @xmath100 to a very thin film of @xmath101 layers , at temperature @xmath102k , i.e. well below @xmath13 ; the lateral dimension of the films is taken constant at @xmath103 , having checked that at this temperature , far from the critical region , such value of @xmath77 well represents the thermodynamic limit for all practical purpose .",
