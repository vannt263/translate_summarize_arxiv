    "the main reason for the incoherent effects is non - interference because of crystal imperfection ( not absolute parallelism of the crystal lattice planes throughout the interferometer ) as well as lattice vibrations and small temperature gradients .",
    "the term @xmath139 leads to a new visibility @xmath140 : @xmath141 this expression is always less than @xmath1 for @xmath142 ( see also eq.(22 ) ) . in order to measure weak signals ( see fig.(8c ) )",
    "the background intensity has to be as small as possible .",
    "this could be a serious constraint considering real experimental conditions using neutrons .",
    "it should be mentioned that the background intensity has no influence on eq.(8 ) concerning the @xmath0 beam splitter system .",
    "note also that an additional empty phase which is a signature of an interferometer does not affect the aforementioned considerations about the intensity and visibility .",
    "+   + it is a common problem in signal processing to measure weak signals .",
    "the absorber serves only to generate these signals . in spite of the constraints mentioned above for almost ideal experimental situations eq.(22 ) predicts a visibility close to @xmath1 .",
    "this could also be the case in systems of mach - zehnder interferometers using laser beams . here",
    "the number of counts registered in a detector in a certain time interval obeys a poisson distribution with variance @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the mean number of counts .",
    "the poisson distribution is a signature of coherent state behavior . for small count rates",
    "the described method may be used to measure small signals with visibility @xmath1 .",
    "+   + the system can easily be adapted ( loop @xmath12 in fig.(1 ) ) to an eight - port interferometer as a high sensitive homodyne detection setup [ 4,7,8 ] as shown in fig.(9 ) . in this case",
    "two vacuum inputs @xmath145 have to be added and the strong local oscillator limit can be applied to the idler beam @xmath146 when the signal beam @xmath147 is relatively strongly attenuated by an absorber @xmath148 .",
    "homodyne detection in laser interferometry is a method , in which the field amplitudes ( the quadrature components ) are measured instead of the quantized intensity",
    ". the balanced version of homodyne detection has a great practical advantage of cancelling technical noise and the classical instabilities of the reference field .",
    "thereby the signal interferes with a coherent laser beam at a well - balanced @xmath0 beam splitter .",
    "it provides the phase reference for the quadrature measurement .",
    "the intensity difference is the quantity of interest because it contains the interference term of the local oscillator and the signal .",
    "+   + finally , as already mentioned above , we would like to point out again that there are good reasons to assume that a similar result can be attained in double mach - zehnder interferometry where photonic beams in fiber glass are used . as a visibility near to @xmath1 is of great advantage for measuring largely attenuated beams",
