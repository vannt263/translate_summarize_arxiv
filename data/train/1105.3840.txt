    "the investigation of electromagnetic fields coupled to strong gravitational fields have an interest from both theoretical perspectives and from a variety of applications in astrophysics .",
    "examples on the theory side include studies of gravitational collapse of charged configurations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , of the validity of the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite , of the existence and properties of quasi black holes and wormholes ( for recent accounts , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , membranes producing repulsive gravity @xcite , and of many other issues .",
    "very often analytical works employ , as tractable physical models , 2-dimensional thin shells sweeping out 3-dimensional timelike hypersurfaces .",
    "recently , we used this idealization to construct `` spherical gravitating condensers ''  two concentric charged shells made of perfect fluids ( satisfying energy conditions ) under the condition that the electric field is non - vanishing only between the shells ( see @xcite and further references on charged shells therein ) .",
    "the literature on electromagnetic fields in relativistic astrophysics is vast . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to referring to several monographs dealing in detail with black - hole electrodynamics , e.g. , @xcite , and we mention the relatively recent work @xcite on electromagnetic fields around compact objects in which various papers are also summarized . in @xcite solutions to the maxwell equations are presented both in the interior and outside a rotating neutron star and the matching conditions of the electromagnetic field at the stellar surface are analyzed in detail .",
    "the fields are not continuous across the stellar surface which gives rise to charges and currents .    in the present paper",
    "we study electromagnetic sources distributed on shells in curved spacetimes in general , considering in particular possible discontinuities of the electromagnetic field across the shells .",
    "the sources discussed are layers with monopole or dipole currents . as far as we are aware electric or magnetic dipole layers and the matching conditions for their fields",
    "were not studied before in the context of general relativity .    in general , in case of dipoles the currents and the electromagnetic field tensor will be distribution valued .",
    "this implies products of distributions in the stress - energy tensor . in order to avoid this",
    ", one can treat the electromagnetic field as a test field and solve the maxwell equations in a given background metric .",
    "in many astrophysical situations this approach is well justified since typically the averaged energy density of the electromagnetic field is much smaller than that of the gravitational field .",
    "this approach is followed here and thus only the standard theory of generalized functions is used .    in another work",
    "@xcite we discuss spherical thin shells endowed with arbitrary , not necessarily spherical distributions of charge or dipole densities in a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "there it was possible to employ the results of @xcite to calculate the fields directly and read off their discontinuities across the shell . in the present paper",
    "we generalize the jump conditions to general backgrounds and general hypersurfaces . as a by - product of those jump conditions",
    "the equivalence of the external fields of magnetic dipoles and certain electric charge currents is proven in general . for elementary dipoles this",
    "was already known in special backgrounds like the kerr spacetime @xcite .",
    "the jump conditions can be used to obtain massive disks endowed with charge and dipole densities using the israel - darboux formalism . in the examples studied here",
    ", we use the schwarzschild disk spacetime as a background , cf .",
    "therefore , we generate massive thin disks ( schwarzschild disks ) endowed with either electric / magnetic test charges or electric / magnetic test dipoles .",
    "the surface currents are depicted and explained using the membrane paradigm .",
    "we use throughout the article the metric signature @xmath0 and units in which @xmath1 .",
    "although in the examples analyzed in section [ sec : examples ] we use the schwarzschild disk spacetimes as backgrounds , the results in the next section , i.e. , the source terms and the jump conditions hold in a more general backgrounds .",
    "of course , it has to admit a hypersurface , where the sources are situated , and the derivation of a dipole current requires , that a family of `` parallel '' hypersurfaces as defined below exists . in @xcite",
    "the case of charged massive shells were already discussed in full einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "nonetheless , we consider test charges in our work , mainly to show in which cases the field generated by an arbitrary dipole distribution can be seen outside of the source as generated by moving charges .      denoting by @xmath2 the maxwell tensor and by @xmath3 its dualnote that we use the signature @xmath4 of the metric and the orientation of the volume form as in @xcite , with the important difference that the indices of our maxwell tensor @xmath2 are interchanged . ] , the maxwell equations in a complex form read as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a self - dual 2-form .",
    "the 4-current @xmath7 consists of an electric part @xmath8 and a magnetic part @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 is vanishing the imaginary part of the maxwell equations allows us to introduce an electric 4-potential @xmath11 such that @xmath12 . in case",
    "there are no electric sources present , we can analogously introduce a magnetic 4-potential @xmath13 such that @xmath14 . in the vacuum region",
    "both 4-potentials can be defined and we denote the complex linear combination by @xmath15 .",
    "timelike hypersurfaces @xmath16 representing the history of charged 2-surfaces ( shells ) are discussed widely in the literature , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we recall their main properties , in particular the form of the 4-current which will help us in formulating the expressions for the dipole current .",
    "suppose the hypersurface @xmath16 is described by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are coordinates in the two parts of the spacetime on the two sides of @xmath16 and the index @xmath19 denotes from which side a quantity is seen .",
    "the unit normal of @xmath16 is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is chosen such that the normal points from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "to shorten the notation we drop the index @xmath19 in the following wherever no confusion is to be expected .",
    "if the intrinsic coordinates of @xmath16 are called @xmath25 , where @xmath26 runs from @xmath27 to @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a timelike coordinate , then the tangential vectors are @xmath30 .",
    "a tensor field @xmath31 can be projected onto these directions at @xmath16 and we denote this by @xmath32    the 4-current of an electrically charged monopole layer is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the surface current of the electrical charges , @xmath35 is the rest electric surface charge density and @xmath36 the 4-velocity of the charged particles projected onto @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider , at least locally , a gaussian normal coordinate system generated by the geodesics @xmath37 orthogonal to @xmath16 and going out from points @xmath38 .",
    "then the metric is block diagonal @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the family of hypersurfaces @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 , are still orthogonal to the family of geodesics @xmath43 and are at a proper distance @xmath44 measured along @xmath37 from @xmath45 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath46 can be used as intrinsic coordinates , thus @xmath47 with the kronecker delta @xmath48 , and @xmath49 denote the intrinsic metrics of the hypersurfaces @xmath42 and @xmath50 their determinant .",
    "a slightly more general form of the metric arises when the coordinate @xmath51 along geodesics @xmath37 is not measuring anymore the proper distance , implying @xmath52 .",
    "these `` generalized '' gaussian normal coordinates are used in the examples in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the 4-current of a charge distribution on the surface in the generalized gaussian normal coordinates is given by @xmath53 to avoid confusion , we recall the definition of the 1-dimensional @xmath54-distribution : for any sufficiently smooth test function @xmath55 the following integral over a spacetime region @xmath56 in the generalized gaussian normal coordinates reduces to the integral over @xmath45 as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a spacetime volume element , @xmath59 is a volume element of the hypersurface @xmath45 .",
    "we construct dipole layers from two oppositely charged monopole layers which are separated by a proper distance @xmath44 . for simplicity",
    "we derive the 4-current in the gaussian normal coordinates and make a coordinate transformation to the generalized gaussian normal coordinates subsequently .",
    "dipole layers arise in the limit of vanishing @xmath44 with a simultaneous limit to infinite ( and opposite ) rest surface charge densities of the two shells .",
    "this means we consider two hypersurfaces @xmath45 and @xmath42 endowed with surface rest charge densities of opposite sign denotes the layer @xmath60 on which the current is given and the index @xmath44 labels different currents during the limiting procedure  the increase / decrease of the charge densities while bringing both shells together . ]",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 and with velocity fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 , so giving rise to two 4-currents .",
    "note that the change of the charge densities in the limit is such that it does not effect the velocity fields .",
    "dipole layers result only in the limiting process @xmath65 if certain properties hold true in the limit which , for simplicity , we assume to hold throughout the entire limiting procedure .",
    "the family of geodesics @xmath37 gives locally rise to an equivalence relation of points similarly to @xcite , i.e. , @xmath66 if there exist a point @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , cf .",
    "[ fig : volumeelement ] .    equivalent points and associated 3-volumes .",
    "the timelike coordinate @xmath69 is suppressed . ]",
    "since the intrinsic coordinates are carried along the geodesics , equivalent points are characterized by the same intrinsic coordinates .",
    "let us assume that two charge elements initially placed at two equivalent points @xmath70 and @xmath71 stay in course of there motion in equivalent points at every moment of time , e.g. , the intrinsic time coordinate @xmath69 , cf .",
    "[ fig : motion ] .",
    "then the coordinate velocities of the charge elements are the same , so we have @xmath72    the motion of two associated infinitesimal charges .",
    "the spacelike coordinate @xmath73 is suppressed . ]",
    "analogously to the the equivalence of points , we also can , with each area element @xmath74 in @xmath45 , associate an area element @xmath75 in @xmath42 which is cut out by the geodesics emanating from the boundary of @xmath74 , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : volumeelement ] .",
    "since the total charge of the dipole shell has to vanish , we suppose that the charge @xmath76 enclosed in any area @xmath74 ( as seen by observers at rest with respect to the intrinsic coordinates ) is the opposite of that enclosed in @xmath75 .",
    "this condition yields @xmath77 as in the classical case , the charge density @xmath78 as @xmath65 .",
    "the electrical rest dipole moment surface density is then naturally defined as @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the limiting procedure based on , and yields the resulting dipole 4-current in the form @xmath80 of course , the total charge contained in any proper volume enclosing a part of the electric dipole layer is vanishing . rewriting this in the generalized gaussian normal coordinate system",
    "we find the 4-current to read @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the surface current of the electrical dipoles and @xmath36 is the 4-velocity of the dipoles projected onto @xmath16 .",
    "let us repeat the definition of the normal derivative of a @xmath54-distribution in a curved background .",
    "for an arbitrary , sufficiently smooth test function @xmath55 the following holds : @xmath83    note that even though a derivative of the delta function appears , no metric functions have to be differentiated because of the integral definition of distributions where @xmath84 appears and cancels with the only metric term in the 4-current depending on @xmath51 .",
    "thus also metrics which are not @xmath85 as they arise in the israel formalism are allowed .",
    "it is also clear by construction and a short calculation , that the continuity equation for @xmath86 implies that the surface currents @xmath34 and @xmath82 satisfy the continuity equation on @xmath16 .",
    "the currents for shells endowed with a magnetic charge or a magnetic dipole density are analogously defined , i.e. , we just have to replace the index @xmath87 by the index @xmath88 .",
    "as is well known from flat space , the jumps of various components of the fields or potentials across a surface are related to electromagnetic sources distributed on that surface . however , even in special relativity magnetic charges are usually not discussed . the jumps resulting from a dipole layer",
    "were , to the best of our knowledge , not discussed in curved spacetimes .",
    "we denote the jumps of a function @xmath55 by @xmath89=f_{+}-f_{-}$ ] .",
    "we study the four cases of electric / magnetic charged shells and electric / magnetic dipole shells separately .",
    "all of them can be obtained using the equivalence principle and maxwell theory .    in the case of",
    "an electrically charged surface kucha showed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that @xmath90=-4\\pi s_{(e\\mathpzc{mo } ) a } , \\quad [ f_{(e\\mathpzc{mo})a b}]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that these equations are covariant with respect to a change of intrinsic coordinates @xmath25 and scalars with respect to the coordinates @xmath91 .",

    "furthermore , introducing the potential @xmath94 on both sides of @xmath16 in different gauges will not change the external field , however , jumps in the potential are , as seen below , related to dipole densities and therefore describe a different physical system ; in particular , the field _ in _ @xmath16 is changed .    in case of a shell endowed with magnetic charges the same equations as and",
    "hold for the dual of the maxwell tensor and for the magnetic 4-potential in a lorenz gauge : @xmath95&=-4\\pi s_{(m\\mathpzc{mo } ) a } , \\quad [ { } ^*f_{(m\\mathpzc{mo})a b}]=0,\\notag\\\\ [ a^{(m)}_{(m\\mathpzc{mo } ) a}]&= [ a^{(m)}_{(m\\mathpzc{mo } ) \\bot}]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the maxwell tensor it follows that the tangential components jump and the normal components are continuous : @xmath96&=0,\\quad [ f_{(m\\mathpzc{mo } ) a b}]= 4\\pi \\epsilon^{(3)}_{abc}{s_{(m\\mathpzc{mo})}^c},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the volume form of @xmath16 related to the induced metric @xmath98 of @xmath16 whereas @xmath99 is the volume form of the spacetime .",
    "tangential indices are raised and lowered with the induced metric and its inverse .",
    "analogously , from the equivalence principle the discontinuities of the maxwell tensor for electric and magnetic dipole densities follow : @xmath100&=0 , & [ f_{(e\\mathpzc{di})a b}]&= -8\\pi { s_{(e\\mathpzc{di})[a , b]}},\\notag\\\\ [ { } ^*f_{(m\\mathpzc{di } ) a\\bot}]&=0 , & [ { } ^*f_{(m\\mathpzc{di})a b}]&= -8\\pi { s_{(m\\mathpzc{di})[a , b]}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the antisymmetrization in the derivatives of @xmath101 is defined as @xmath102}=\\tfrac 12(b_{ab}-b_{ba})$ ] .",
    "note that a layer with a curl - free @xmath103 will not produce a jump in the external field and thus the source can only be detected by observing the trajectories of particles crossing that layer , i.e. , by measuring the internal field in @xmath16 .",
    "the 4-potentials satisfy in these cases the following jump conditions : @xmath104&=0,&[a^{(e)}_{(e\\mathpzc{di } ) a}]&=4\\pi s_{(e\\mathpzc{di } ) a},\\\\ [ a^{(m)}_{(m\\mathpzc{di } ) \\bot}]&=0 , & [ a^{(m)}_{(m\\mathpzc{di } ) a}]&=4\\pi s_{(m\\mathpzc{di } ) a}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] additionally , the normal components of the maxwell tensor have a @xmath54-like contribution @xmath105n\\delta(\\phi)$ ] , the field `` between the two layers '' . in order to see this contribution , we insert the aforementioned jumps into the maxwell equations and calculate the source . using again gaussian normal coordinates we start with an electric 4-potential which is discontinuous across @xmath16 and calculate the sources .",
    "hence , we write @xmath106 with @xmath107=0 $ ] , which implies the maxwell tensor to be @xmath108\\delta(x^3-x^3_0 )",
    ". \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting this into the maxwell equations and using the jump conditions above yields @xmath109 where the first two terms are the source terms for a charged layer and for a dipole layer .",
    "the last two terms are sources outside of @xmath16 , for instance a volume charge density . in the remainder",
    "we will assume that outside of the shell there are no magnetic or electric sources .",
    "in flat spacetimes and also in certain cases of electromagnetism in curved backgrounds , e.g. , in the schwarzschild and the kerr spacetimes @xcite , the equivalence of the external field of a magnetic point dipole and of an infinitesimal electric charge current loop is known and often used .",
    "naturally , it can also be easily shown that the external field of an electric point dipole is indistinguishable from that of an infinitesimal magnetic charge current loop .",
    "a similar result can be shown to hold in the case of layers of dipoles . in our gaussian",
    "normal coordinates the dual of the maxwell tensor for a shell endowed with magnetic dipoles reads as follows , cf . and : @xmath110 of course , the internal field must be changed to transform locally from sources in the form of magnetic dipoles to electric currents . however ,",
    "if we remove the last term in from the field the external field remains unchanged .",
    "an observer outside can detect the difference only by examining trajectories of charged test particles crossing the shell .",
    "furthermore , the jumps of the maxwell tensor remain the same : @xmath111=4\\pi \\epsilon^{(3)\\phantom a bc}_{\\phantom{(3)}a}s_{(m\\mathpzc{di } ) b , c},\\quad [ f_{(m\\mathpzc{di})ab}]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using equation , these jumps are produced by an electric current @xmath112 if @xmath113    the electric charge current defined in such a way can also be seen as a source .",
    "the continuity equation for @xmath34 is satisfied trivially . however , since the charge density @xmath114 does not need to vanish , electrical charges are introduced in general .",
    "the total charge is in principle detectable at infinity in the asymptotics of the field assuming it falls off sufficiently fast .",
    "nonetheless , the total charge for a field generated by magnetic dipoles is vanishing .",
    "how is this to be resolved ?",
    "the total electric charge @xmath115 of @xmath16 as seen for observers at rest with respect to the intrinsic coordinates is given by @xmath116 together with equation and stokes theorem we obtain @xmath117 the asymptotic behavior of the field implies a vanishing current at infinity .",
    "thus , no _ total _ electric charge @xmath115 will be present though `` local '' volumes can contain a net charge .",
    "this is also in correspondence with the known results for point dipoles . in a rest frame of a point dipole",
    "the external field can be seen as caused by an infinitesimal charge current loop with a vanishing time component .",
    "this is usually interpreted as two currents of positive and negative charges such that the charge densities in the rest frame of the dipole cancel each other and  for example the positive charges are at rest ( ions of the conductor ) and the negative charges ( electrons ) contribute to the current .",
    "however , in a general frame as used here the charge densities do not necessarily cancel anymore . to generalize this to layers",
    "these point dipoles have to be superposed and so the current loops .",
    "the net current can have a charge density because one is not in a comoving frame of the dipoles .",
    "if the fields do not fall off sufficiently fast , then the total charge of the shell need not vanish or be definable . in such a case charges can also be  placed at infinity \" which is reflected by a corresponding boundary condition .",
    "an example is given in section [ subsec : asymptoticallyhomogeneous ] .",
    "the argument given above can be reversed and used to show that the external field of every electric charge surface current can also be produced by a charge density at rest in a given frame of reference and a magnetic dipole surface current .",
    "the integrability condition of equation for @xmath118 is then equivalent to the continuity equation of the electric charge surface current .",
    "it is obvious that an analogous equivalence between electric dipoles and magnetic charges can be established . except for this kind of non - uniqueness ,",
    "the field and its sources are completely determined by the jump conditions - .",
    "the schwarzschild metric in schwarzschild coordinates @xmath119 reads @xmath120 in @xcite massive disks of counterrotating matter , the `` schwarzschild disks '' , were constructed from this spacetime using the israel - darboux formalism and weyl coordinates @xmath121 @xmath122 this was done by identifying the surfaces @xmath123 and @xmath124 . from the jumps of the extrinsic curvature of the resulting surface",
    "an energy - momentum density of the disk was obtained .",
    "the disks are infinite but their mass is finite and the mass density decreases rapidly at large radii .",
    "we show here how to endow such disks with an electric / magnetic charge densities or electric / magnetic dipole densities in a test field approach .",
    "we demonstrate this with two examples using the asymptotic homogeneous field and the field generated by a point charge .",
    "the same can be done to model more general distributions using the general solutions of the maxwell equations for test fields on a schwarzschild background given in @xcite .    in @xmath16 defined by @xmath125 ,",
    "we introduce intrinsic coordinates @xmath126 which coincide with the schwarzschild coordinates @xmath127 in the disk but are capitalized to prevent confusion .",
    "the components of the normal vector in schwarzschild coordinates are given by @xmath128 where again `` @xmath24 '' denotes the quantities as seen from @xmath129 and `` @xmath23 '' as seen from @xmath130 .",
    "note that @xmath131 .",
    "the first test field to be discussed is the asymptotically homogeneous electric and magnetic field , for which the complex 4-potential and maxwell tensor in schwarzschild coordinates read as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath132 the 4-potential is in fact not given in @xcite but can be calculated easily .",
    "assume the field in the upper / lower half is parametrized by @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "this leads to a surface current @xmath144 in the classical case @xmath145 the charges are at rest with a charge density equal to the first factor in the first equation .",
    "the discontinuities in the magnetic potential and the tangential components of the dual of the maxwell tensor are in this case understood as being caused by the discontinuities of the orthogonal components of the maxwell tensor and the presence of the electric monopole layer and , hence , the impossibility to introduce a magnetic potential globally .",
    "looking at the classical case @xmath145 , the principal problem mentioned after equation becomes apparent when dealing with fields which are not falling off sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "the axial current vanishes in this limit and thus can not cause the magnetic field .",
    "the existing magnetic field can be explained by `` magnetic charges or electric currents at infinity '' .",
    "therefore , the disk is not the only source of the external field .",
    "this problem does not occur for fields which are falling off sufficiently fast .",
    "such are discussed in the next example . however , for completeness we give here the 4-current provided that the discontinuities are interpreted as the result of a magnetic dipole layer according to equation : @xmath146 here the constants @xmath147 and @xmath148 are chosen such that the current is not singular at the axis and the dipole density vanishes at infinity .",
    "analogously , we can study disks endowed with a magnetic charge density or electric dipole density by setting @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",

    "however , it holds that @xmath168 , so the same holds for @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , functions @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath169 should be read as functions with the argument @xmath170 .",
    "the jumps of the tangential components of the maxwell tensor can be inferred from the jumps of the 4-potential .",
    "we can now discuss two cases  a monopole layer and a dipole layer .      in order to obtain continuous tangential components of the 4-potential we have to set @xmath171 .",
    "then the surface 3-current can be read off and .",
    "the only non - vanishing component is @xmath172 .",
    "however , it is possible to consider two counterrotating streams with an equal charge , cf . with the underlying matter currents in the schwarzschild disk @xcite",
    "this would of course change the charge density seen by a comoving observer .",
    "there are several parameters governing the behavior of the solution : the cut parameter @xmath173 , the charge @xmath174 which acts as scaling , and the position of the two charges @xmath175 .",
    "in general , there is one maximum associated with the position of the charge @xmath174 as in classical electrodynamics , and there is also the second maximum due to the influence of the black hole , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargedensity ] .",
    "although for @xmath176 an axially symmetric distribution is obtained , so , only one maximum is present in this case .      in the general case the first maximum lies at @xmath180 and the second at @xmath181 , i.e. , on opposite the side of the black hole in the `` original '' spacetime .",
    "the second maximum can be understood using the membrane paradigm @xcite ( alternatively by discussing the boundary conditions at the horizon @xcite ) .",
    "interpreting the horizon as a conducting sphere , a polarization is to be expected due to the field of the test charge .",
    "this will lead to a fictitious charge density at the horizon , cf .",
    "@xcite , as follows : @xmath182 where the upper sign denotes the induced charge density for the charge @xmath174 at @xmath183 and the lower for the charge @xmath174 at @xmath184 . in the following",
    "we discuss only the @xmath24 case , the other one follows from the reflection symmetry . assuming @xmath185 , the area of the conducting sphere characterized by @xmath186 is negatively charged .",
    "the opening angle @xmath187 as seen from the test charge @xmath174 for this area was described in @xcite .",
    "there it was also discussed , that the field lines emanating from @xmath175 with an angle @xmath188 are bent towards the horizon and cross it eventually .",
    "field lines starting at @xmath189 are first bent towards the horizon due to the opposite sign of its charge density and then bent away because of the change of sign in the polarization density .",
    "this leads to an increase / decrease of the tangential / normal components of the electric field in the disk close to the axis of the black hole facing @xmath174 . on the other side of the black hole",
    "the normal / tangential components of the electric field in the disk are increased / decreased .",
    "thus in general , two maxima for the charge density are obtained on opposite sides of the axis . for the dipole density also two maxima are to be expected but both are lying on the side of the black hole facing @xmath174 .",
    "the surface charge current in @xmath16 behaves for @xmath139 like @xmath190 the fall off is sufficiently fast to permit the definition of the total charge which can of course be read off from the unchanged asymptotic behavior of the field and thus is still @xmath174 .",
    "having fixed @xmath191 , the parameter @xmath173 can be used to slow down the decrease of the charge density as can be seen from , but since the total charge must remain the same , the charge gets only `` smeared out '' .      to obtain continuous normal components of the maxwell tensor one",
    "has to choose @xmath192 ; the surface current is given by and .",
    "again , the surface current allows two interpretations : the distribution is static or it consists of two counterrotating streams .",
    "the same parameters arise here as in the last case and the generic behavior for some specific values is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoledensitypointcharge ] .",
    "the two maxima can again be understood on the grounds of the membrane paradigm as described above .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the dipole density is @xmath193    the relation between a monopole distribution and a dipole distribution is illustrated in the following .",
    "let us consider the electric 4-potential and the jumps in the tangential components of the maxwell tensor as produced from the jumps in the normal components of the dual of the maxwell tensor , i.e. , of a magnetic charge density .",
    "if we remove the @xmath194distribution terms of the field , we obtain a field which is generated by a magnetic current which satisfies @xmath195 as stated in section [ subsec : discontinuitiesgeneral ] for the general case , it is obvious here that the continuity equation is also satisfied for the magnetic surface current . the magnetic charge density of this current is vanishing which can be interpreted as two currents with opposite charges , one of them at rest for example . since the field falls off sufficiently fast and",
    "no total charge is present this is the sole source of the field .",
    "it is again clear from the symmetry of the maxwell equations that the calculations of this section can be repeated for a magnetic point charge in order to obtain a magnetic charge density or a magnetic dipole density .",
