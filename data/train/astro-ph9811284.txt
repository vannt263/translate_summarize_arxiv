    "recent studies show that inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of interstellar photons off cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons seems to play a more important rle in generation of diffuse @xmath0-ray  emission from the galaxy than thought before ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the spectrum of galactic @xmath0-rays  as measured by egret shows enhanced emission above 1 gev in comparison with calculations based on locally measured proton and electron spectra assuming the same spectral shape over the whole galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  observations therefore indicate that their spectra on the large scale in the galaxy could be different .",
    "harder cr spectra could provide better agreement , but the @xmath0-ray  data alone can not discriminate between the @xmath1-decay and inverse compton explanations .",
    "the hard electron spectrum hypothesis seems to be more likely due to the probably clumpy distribution of electrons at high energies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the hard nucleon spectrum can be excluded at the few @xmath2 level on the basis of antiproton data above 3 gev and positron measurements ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the interstellar electron spectrum is indeed harder than that measured directly , then the ics is a main contributor to the diffuse galactic emission above several mev and can account for the famous ` gev excess ' .",
    "the origin and spectrum of the galactic diffuse @xmath0-ray  emission has a strong impact also on the extragalactic studies and cosmological implications .",
    "the origin of the truly extragalactic @xmath0-ray  background is still unknown .",
    "the models discussed range from the primordial black hole evaporation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and annihilation of exotic particles in the early universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) to the contribution of unresolved discrete sources such as active galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the spectrum of the extragalactic emission itself is the main uncertain component of these models .",
    "the latter can be addressed only by the accurate study of the galactic diffuse emission . additionally , it is relevant to dark matter studies such as the search for signatures of wimp annihilation , which is also a potential source of @xmath0-rays , positrons , and antiprotons in the galactic halo ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the calculations of the ics in most studies are based on the formula obtained by jones ( 1968 ) which remains a good approximation when considering isotropic scattering",
    ". however , the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) ( apart from the cosmic microwave background ) is essentially anisotropic .",
    "the stellar and dust emission originates in the galactic plane and preferentially scatters back to the observer also in the plane .",
    "therefore , the observer sees mostly head on collisions even if the electron distribution is isotropic .",
    "though qualitatively such an effect was pointed out many years ago ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the magnitude of this effect has not been evaluated accurately in the literature so far .",
    "since ics is one of the most important components of the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray  emission its accurate calculation is of interest for astrophysical studies .",
    "we have developed a propagation code ( ` galprop ' ) which aims to reproduce self - consistently observational data of many kinds related to cr origin and propagation : direct measurements of nuclei , antiprotons , electrons and positrons , @xmath0-rays , and synchrotron radiation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we evaluate the effect of anisotropy in the ics of cr electrons off interstellar photons and present corresponding formulas , which serve a basis for our detailed analysis of the galactic diffuse emission in an accompanying paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "we make calculations with a realistic isrf and also a simplified distribution of photons ( thin emitting disk ) , which allows for simpler analytical treatment .",
