    "the hypothesis of limiting fragmentation in high energy hadron - hadron collisions was suggested nearly four decades ago @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis states that the produced particles , in the rest frame of one of the colliding hadrons , will approach a limiting distribution .",
    "these universal distributions describe the momentum distributions of the fragments of the other hadron .",
    "central to the original hypothesis of the limiting fragmentation in ref .",
    "@xcite was the assumption that the total hadronic cross sections would become constant at large center - of - mass energy .",
    "if this occurred , the excitation and break - up of a hadron would be independent of the center - of - mass energy and distributions in the fragmentation region would approach a limiting curve .",
    "we now know that the total hadronic cross - sections are not constant at high energies .",
    "instead , to the highest energies achieved , they grow slowly with the center - of - mass energy @xmath0 , with favored functional forms being either a power law behavior @xmath1 with @xmath2  @xcite or a @xmath3 @xcite . a measurement of the total cross - section at the lhc @xcite will further help constrain the possible functional forms .    even though the cross - sections are not constant , limiting fragmentation appears to have a wide regime of validity .",
    "it was confirmed experimentally in @xmath4 and nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energies @xcite .",
    "more recently , the brahms and phobos experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) have performed detailed studies of the pseudo - rapidity distribution of the produced charged particles @xmath5 for a wide range ( @xmath6 ) of pseudo - rapidities , and for several center - of - mass energies ( @xmath7 ) in nucleus - nucleus ( au - au and cu - cu ) and deuteron - nucleus ( d - au ) collisions .",
    "results for pseudo - rapidity distributions have also been obtained over a limited kinematic range in pseudo - rapidity by the star experiment at rhic  @xcite . these measurements in a - a and d - a collisions were performed for several centralities .",
    "in addition to the d - au and a - a data , there are @xmath8 data at @xmath9 and also at @xmath10  gev .",
    "( in the near future , data at @xmath11 gev may become available . )",
    "these measurements have opened a new and precise window on many scaling phenomena glimpsed at lower energies . in particular , they have performed detailed studies of the limiting fragmentation phenomenon . the pseudo - rapidity distribution @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the pseudo - rapidity shifted by the beam rapidity @xmath14 ) is observed to become independent of the center - of - mass energy @xmath0 in the region around @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the impact parameter .",
    "it is worth noting that this scaling is in a strong disagreement with boost invariant scenarios which predict a fixed fragmentation region and a broad central plateau growing with energy",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to understand the nature of hadronic interactions that lead to limiting fragmentation and the deviations away from it .",
    "in a recent article , biaas and jeabek  @xcite , argued that some qualitative features of limiting fragmentation can be explained in a two - step model involving multiple gluon exchange between partons of the colliding hadrons and the subsequent radiation of hadronic clusters by the interacting hadrons . in this paper , we compute limiting fragmentation within the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach  @xcite to high energy hadronic collisions ",
    "its relation to the biaas - jeabek model will be addressed briefly later .    in the cgc formalism",
    ", gluon production in the limiting fragmentation region can be described , at leading order , in the framework of @xmath18-factorization . under this assumption",
    ", the inclusive cross - section for produced gluons is expressed as the convolution of the  unintegrated parton distributions \" in the projectile and target respectively   which is probed at large @xmath19 , and `` target '' the nucleus @xmath20 which is probed at small values of @xmath21 . of course , our choice of semantics , reminiscent of what is used in fixed target experiments , is somewhat arbitrary in collider experiments where the lab frame and the center of mass frame are identical .",
    "] , @xmath22 times a ( transverse momentum dependent ) vertex squared . as we shall emphasize later , the name ",
    "unintegrated parton distributions \" though conventional is somewhat imprecise because the objects @xmath23 that enter in this formula differ from the expectation value of the gluon number operator . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2phis ] ) , @xmath19 and @xmath21 are the longitudinal momentum fractions of the gluons probed in the projectile and target , namely , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the beam rapidity , @xmath26 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath27 is the transverse momentum of the produced gluon . we should emphasize that the kinematics here is the @xmath28 eikonal kinematics , which provides the leading contribution to gluon production in the cgc picture .    as we will discuss further later , @xmath18-factorization actually works best in the limiting fragmentation kinematics where @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath18-factorization tells us that the cross - sections depend in general on both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , target limiting fragmentation implies a dependence on solely @xmath33 of the spectrum of produced particles integrated over the transverse momentum .",
    "as we shall see in section [ sec:2 ] , such a scaling emerges in a straightforward manner in the @xmath18-factorization framework if a ) the typical transverse momentum in the projectile is much smaller than the typical transverse momentum in the target , and b ) if unitarity is preserved in the evolution of the target with @xmath21 .",
    "these two conditions are naturally fulfilled in the cgc picture when @xmath21 becomes so small that the target reaches the `` black disk '' limit .",
    "more importantly , by studying how this limit is reached , one gets some insight into systematic deviations away from the limiting fragmentation .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the unintegrated distributions with @xmath34 are described in the cgc by the renormalization group equations called the jimwlk equations  @xcite .",
    "these equations , more generally , describe the @xmath34 evolution of @xmath35-point parton correlation functions .",
    "the dynamics in the evolution at high parton densities is characterized by a ",
    "saturation momentum \" @xmath36 .",
    "this scale is the typical transverse momentum of partons in the hadron or nuclear wave - function is also related to the density of color charges per unit of transverse area in the hadron under consideration . ] .",
    "partons with @xmath37 saturate in the wave - function with occupation numbers of order @xmath38 .",
    "the implications of saturated or  black disc \" distributions for limiting fragmentation were studied previously in the cgc approach   by jalilian - marian  @xcite and in the work of kharzeev and levin  @xcite and later by kharzeev , levin and nardi @xcite . in @xcite , it was _ a priori _ assumed that the target is very dense and appears black to the dilute partons in the projectile .",
    "this leads to the simple formula @xmath39 \\ ; , \\ ] ] for the rapidity distribution of the produced hadrons in aa collisions , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the quark and gluon distributions in the projectile nucleus . with a suitable choice of a scale @xmath42 in these distributions ,",
    "this prescription gave a reasonable description of the fragmentation region .    in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath18-factorization formalism was employed , together with a  saturation \" ansatz for the unintegrated gluon distribution  .",
    "our approach to computing the inclusive gluon production in the saturation scenario is very similar in spirit to the one pioneered in @xcite . here however , the unintegrated gluon distributions at small @xmath34 ( @xmath43 ) are computed using a mean field version of the jimwlk equations called the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation  @xcite .",
    "this approximation is strictly valid in the large @xmath44 , large mass number @xmath45 and high energy limit .",
    "however , the bk equation may have a wider range of applicability beyond these asymptotic limits .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown recently that the bk equation lies in the same universality class as the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov equation in statistical mechanics , which describe a wide range of reaction - diffusion phenomena in nature  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss results for limiting fragmentation from solutions of the bk equation for unintegrated distributions in both the fixed and running coupling cases .    for @xmath46 , the unintegrated distribution , computed using the bk equation ,",
    "is smoothly matched on to a functional form that contains key features expected of large @xmath34 parton distributions .",
    "we will also discuss what more detailed comparisons to the data can teach us about these distributions .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss inclusive gluon production in high energy hadron and nuclear collisions . in the kinematical region of interest ,",
    "@xmath18-factorization is applicable ; this allows us to relate the distribution of produced gluons to the unintegrated gluon distributions in the hadron wave - functions .",
    "parton - hadron duality  @xcite is assumed to compare the distribution of produced gluons to those of hadrons .",
    "( the effect of fragmentation functions can be significant at higher energies  a qualitative discussion is presented in section 4 . ) the evolution of the unintegrated gluon distributions ( with @xmath19 and @xmath21 respectively ) in the projectile and target wave - functions is described by solutions of the bk equation .",
    "the fixed and running coupling forms of the bk equation and its solution are discussed in section 3 .",
    "results for gluon distributions obtained from numerical solutions of the bk equation are compared to data on limiting fragmentation in section 4 .",
    "we compare our results to data from pp , deuteron - gold and aa collisions and discuss their dependence on the initial conditions , running coupling effects and on infrared regulators .",
    "our results are summarized and open problems emphasized in the concluding section .",
    "at very high energies , for @xmath47 , gluon production and fragmentation is the dominant mechanism for particle production . when the occupation number of partons is small in one of the colliding hadrons and large in the other ( as is the case in proton - nucleus or nucleus - nucleus collisions in the fragmentation region of one of the nuclei ) , the inclusive multiplicity distribution of produced gluons can be expressed in the @xmath18-factorized form  @xcite , @xmath48 strictly speaking , the formula , as written here , is only valid at zero impact parameter and assumes that the nuclei have a uniform density in the transverse plane .",
    "indeed , the functions @xmath23 are defined for the entire nucleus . here , @xmath49 denotes the transverse area of the overlap region between the two nuclei , while @xmath50 are the total transverse area of the nuclei , and @xmath51 is the casimir in the fundamental representation .",

    "( [ eq : unintbgv ] ) is given by the bk equation .",
    "these distributions @xmath23 , albeit very similar to the canonical unintegrated gluon distributions in the hadrons , should not be confused with the latter  @xcite . however , at large @xmath18 ( @xmath69 ) , they coincide with the usual unintegrated gluon distribution and this determines their normalization ] this normalization is different from ref .",
    "@xcite - we have checked however that , when appropriately normalized , our expression for the inclusive gluon distributions is identical to that of ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .    the @xmath18-factorized expression in eq .  ( [ eq : ktfact ] )",
    "is only valid for inclusive gluon production when one of the hadrons is dilute and the other is dense . in the cgc framework",
    ", this means that we keep only terms of orders @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the amplitudes , if @xmath45 and @xmath20 are the dilute and dense hadrons respectively .",
    "this factorization is therefore applicable for proton - proton collisions , or nucleus - nucleus collisions in the fragmentation region of one of the projectiles .",
    "clearly , it applies as well to proton / deuteron  gold collisions .",
    "@xmath18-factorization breaks down in kinematic regions that do not satisfy this dilute  dense criterion .",
    "it particular , it is not a good approximation in the central rapidity region . although there are some analytical attempts to address these violations of @xmath18-factorization  @xcite , these have been computed only numerically  @xcite thus far .",
    "for quark production , @xmath18-factorization is broken already at leading order  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of their breaking has been quantified recently  @xcite . here",
    "we will consider only the @xmath18-factorized expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ktfact ] ) with the understanding that this expression likely has significant corrections at central rapidities .",
    "these will be discussed further later in the paper .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ktfact ] ) , it is easy to see how limiting fragmentation emerges in the limit where @xmath72 .",
    "in this situation , the typical transverse momentum @xmath18 in the projectile is much smaller than the typical transverse momentum @xmath73 in the target , because these are controlled by saturation scales evaluated respectively at @xmath19 and at @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high energies , it is legitimate to approximate @xmath74 by @xmath75 .",
    "when we integrate the gluon distribution over @xmath76 , we thus obtain @xmath77 this expression , in the stated approximation , is nearly independent of @xmath21 and therefore depends only weakly on on @xmath31 . to see this more clearly , note that to obtain the second line in the above expression , we used eq .",
    "( [ eq : unintbgv ] ) and the fact that the wilson line @xmath56 is a unitary matrix .",
    "the details of the evolution are therefore not important to achieve limiting fragmentation , only that the evolution equation preserve unitarity .",
    "the residual dependence on @xmath21 comes from the the upper limit @xmath78 of the integral in the second line .",
    "this ensures the applicability of the approximation that led to the expression in the second line above .",
    "the integral over @xmath79 gives the integrated gluon distribution in the projectile , evaluated at a resolution scale of the order of the saturation scale of the target .",
    "therefore , the residual dependence on @xmath80 arises only via the scale dependence of the gluon distribution of the projectile .",
    "this residual dependence on @xmath80 is very weak at large @xmath19 because it is the regime where bjorken scaling is observed .    the formula in eq .",
    "[ eq : dngdyaprox ] was used previously in ref .",
    "the nuclear gluon distribution here is determined by global fits to deeply inelastic scattering and drell - yan data .",
    "we note that the glue at large @xmath34 is very poorly constrained at present  @xcite .",
    "the approach of bialas and jezabek @xcite also amounts to using a similar formula , although convoluted with a fragmentation function ( see eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of @xcite  in addition , both the parton distribution and the fragmentation function are assumed to be scale independent in this approach ) .",
    "we will discuss the effect of fragmentation functions later in our discussion .",
    "though limiting fragmentation can be simply understood as a consequence of unitarity in the high energy limit , what may be more compelling are observed deviations from limiting fragmentation and how these vary with energy",
    ". these deviations may probe more deeply our understanding of the dynamics of both large @xmath34 and small @xmath34 modes in hadronic wavefunctions .",
    "in particular , in the small @xmath34 case , it may provide further insight into the renormalization group equations that , while trivially preserving unitarity , demonstrate interesting pre - asymptotic behavior .",
    "these concerns provide the motivation for this detailed study with the balitsky - kovchegov renormalization group equation  to be discussed in the following section .",
    "we begin by briefly recapitulating key features of the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation and its solution  @xcite .",
    "readers are referred to recent review literature on the subject for a more detailed discussion  @xcite .",
    "the bk equation is a non - linear evolution equation in rapidity @xmath81 for the forward scattering amplitude of a quark - antiquark dipole scattering off a target in the limit of very high center - of - mass energy @xmath0 .",
    "it was originally derived , within the dipole picture ( which assumes the large @xmath44 limit ) at small values of bjorken @xmath34 , by taking into account multiple rescatterings of the @xmath82 dipoles off a dense nuclear target .",
    "the bk equation for the amplitude is equivalent to the corresponding jimwlk equation  @xcite of the color glass condensate , in a mean field ( large @xmath44 and large @xmath45 ) approximation where higher order dipole correlators are neglected .",

    "the pseudo - rapidity distributions are determined by the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yeta ] ) .    in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show pseudo - rapidity distributions of the charged particles produced in nucleon - nucleon collisions for center of mass energies ranging from @xmath169 to @xmath170 .",
    "we have performed calculations for two different input distributions at starting value of @xmath133 , namely , the gbw and mv models . the normalization has been treated as a free parameter .",
    "extrapolations to large values of @xmath34 are performed using the formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : extrapolx ] ) .",
    "plots on the left hand side of figure  [ fig:2 ] are obtained for @xmath171 whereas the right hand side plots are done for @xmath172 .",
    "the different values of @xmath128 are obtained by varying @xmath125 when solving the bk equation .",
    "note that while @xmath128 controls the growth of @xmath173 with energy , the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) has the growth rate @xmath174 which is significantly lower .",
    "so @xmath175 , which gives reasonable fits ( more on this in the next paragraph ) to the pp data for the mv initial conditions , corresponds to @xmath176 , which is close to the value for the energy dependence of the amplitude in next - to - leading order resummed bk computations  @xcite and in empirical dipole model comparisons to the hera data  @xcite .",
    "we find that our computations are extremely sensitive to the extrapolation prescription to large @xmath34 .",
    "this is not a surprise since we are probing the wave - function of the projectile at fairly large values of @xmath19 . from our analysis",
    ", we see that the data naively favor a non - zero value for @xmath138 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : extrapolx ] ) . the zero value of @xmath138 results in the distributions which , in both the mv and gbw cases give reasonable fits ( albeit with different normalizations ) at lower energies but systematically become harder relative to the data as the energy is increased . to fit the data in the mv model up to the highest ua5 energies ,",
    "a lower value of @xmath128 than that in the gbw model is required .",
    "this is connected with the fact that mv model has tails which extend to larger values in @xmath18 than in the gbw model . as the energy is increased",
    ", the typical @xmath177 does as well .",
    "we will return to this point shortly .    in figure  [ fig:3 ] the same distributions",
    "are shown as a function of the @xmath178 .",
    "the calculations for @xmath171 , are consistent with scaling in the limiting fragmentation region .",
    "there is a slight discrepancy between the calculations and the data in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "this discrepancy may be a hint that one is seeing violations of @xmath18 formalism in that regime because @xmath18 formalism becomes less reliable the further one is from the dilute - dense kinematics of the fragmentation regions  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy should grow with increasing energy .",
    "however , our parameters are not sufficiently constrained that a conclusive statement can be made .    in changing from rapidity to pseudo - rapidity distributions",
    ", one has to use a jacobian with a mass parameter .",
    "we have chosen this parameter , for consistency , to be the same as our @xmath145 cut - off for the integration over the transverse momentum in the formula for the gluon production .",
    "we have checked the sensitivity of our calculations to variations in the @xmath145 cut - off @xmath154 in the range @xmath179 . in figure  [ fig:3a ] we show the results for the pp collisions with two different values of @xmath180 .",
    "the ` dip ' in the pseudo - rapidity distribution becomes more or less pronounced when the parameter @xmath154 is decreased or increased respectively .",
    "we note that in order to obtain a reasonable description of the data we also had to adjust the other parameters ( normalization and @xmath128 ) .    in figure  [ fig:4 ]",
    "we show the extrapolation to higher energies , in particular the lhc range of energies for the calculation with the gbw input .",
    "we observed previously that the mv initial distribution , when evolved to these higher energies , gives a rapidity distribution which is very flat in the @xmath181 regime .",
    "we noted that this is because the average transverse momentum grows with the energy giving a significant contribution from the high @xmath18 tail of the distribution in the mv input in eq .",
    "( [ eq : extrapolx ] ) .",
    "the effect of fragmentation functions on softening the spectra in the limiting fragmentation region can be simply understood by the following qualitative argument .",
    "the inclusive hadron distribution can be expressed as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the fragmentation function denoting the probability , at the scale @xmath184 , that a gluon fragment into a hadron carrying a fraction @xmath185 of its transverse momentum . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider here the probability for gluons fragmenting into the hadron .",
    "the lower limit of the integral can be determined from the kinematic requirement that @xmath186we obtain , @xmath187 if @xmath188 were zero , the effect of including fragmentation effects would simply be to multiply eq .  (",
    "[ eq : fragment ] ) by an overall constant factor . at lower energies ,",
    "the typical value of @xmath189 is small for a fixed @xmath31 ; the value of @xmath188 is quite low .",
    "however , as the center of mass energy is increased , the typical @xmath189 value grows slowly with the energy .",
    "this has the effect of raising @xmath188 for a fixed @xmath31 , thereby lowering the value of the multiplicity in eq.([eq : fragment ] ) for that @xmath31 .",
    "note further that eq .",
    "( [ eq : min - frac ] ) suggests that there is a kinematic bound on @xmath189 as a function of @xmath31only very soft gluons can contribute to the inclusive multiplicity .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pt_pp ] we illustrate @xmath145 distributions obtained from the mv input compare to the ua1 data @xcite .",
    "we compare the calculation with and without the fragmentation function .",
    "the fragmentation function has been taken from @xcite .",
    "clearly the  bare \" mv model does not describe the data at large @xmath18 because it does not include fragmentation function effects which , as discussed , make the spectrum less flat .",
    "in contrast , because the @xmath18 spectrum of the gbw model dies exponentially at large @xmath18 , this ",
    "unphysical \" @xmath18 behavior mimics the effect of fragmentation functions ",
    "see figure [ fig : pt_pp ] .",
    "hence extrapolations of this model , as shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] give a more reasonable looking result .",
    "similar conclusions were reached previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we next compute the pseudo - rapidity distribution in deuteron - gold collisions . in figure  [ fig:6 ]",
    "we show the result for the calculation compared with the da data  @xcite .",
    "the unintegrated gluons were extracted from the pp and aa data .",
    "the overall shape of the distribution matches well on the deuteron side with the minimum - bias data .",
    "the disagreement on the nuclear fragmentation side is easy to understand since , as mentioned earlier , it requires a better implementation of nuclear geometry effects .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in ref .",
    "@xcite in their comparisons to the rhic deuteron - gold data .",
    "we now apply our considerations to central nucleus  nucleus collisions . in figure  [ fig:5 ]",
    "we present fits to data on the pseudo - rapidity distributions in gold ",
    "gold collisions from the phobos , brahms and star collaborations .",
    "the data  @xcite are for @xmath190 and the brahms data  @xcite are for @xmath191 .",
    "a reasonable description of limiting fragmentation is achieved in this case as well .",
    "one again has discrepancies in the central rapidity region as in the pp case . as mentioned previously ,",
    "a natural explanation for this discrepancy is the violation of @xmath18-factorization .",
    "it is expected that these violations decrease the multiplicity in this regime  @xcite relative to extrapolations using @xmath18-factorization .",
    "we find that values of @xmath192 gev for the saturation scale give the best fits .",
    "this value is consistent with other estimates  @xcite .",
    "apparently the gold - gold data are better described by the calculations which have @xmath172 .",
    "this might be related to the difference in the large @xmath34 distributions in the proton and nucleus .",
    "also , slightly higher values of @xmath128 are preferred .",
    "this variation of parameters from aa to pp case might be also connected with the fact that in our approach the impact parameter is integrated out , so that there is no detailed information on the nuclear geometry .",
    "a more detailed calculation with the impact parameter dependence taken into account is left for future investigations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : auauext ] we show the extrapolation of two calculations to higher energy @xmath193 .",
    "we note that the calculation within the mv model gives results which would violate the scaling in the limiting fragmentation region by approximately @xmath194 at larger @xmath31 .",
    "this violation is partly because of the effect of fragmentation functions discussed previously and in part due to the fact that the integrated parton distributions from the mv model do not obey bjorken scaling at large values of @xmath34 . in the latter case ,",
    "the violations are proportional to @xmath195 as discussed previously .",
    "the effects of the former are simulated by the gbw model - the extrapolation of which , to higher energies , is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the band separating the two therefore suggests the systematic uncertainity in such an extrapolation coming from a ) the choice of initial conditions and b ) the effects of fragmentation functions which are also uncertain at lower transverse momenta .",
    "finally , the transverse momentum distribution in the gold - gold collisions is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_auau ] .",
    "the data at @xmath196 are from the phobos collaboration @xcite .",
    "again , in this case , the calculation without fragmentation function tends to overshoot the data significantly at high values of @xmath197 . including fragmentation function effects  @xcite results in a better agreement with the shape of the @xmath197 distribution as expected . a more detailed study to extract parameters that give the best chi - squared values",
    "will be performed at a later date .",
    "we studied here the phenomenon of limiting fragmentation in the color glass condensate framework . in the dilute - dense ( projectile - target ) kinematics of the fragmentation regions",
    ", one can derive ( in this framework ) an expression for inclusive gluon distributions which is @xmath18 factorizable into the product of  unintegrated \" gluon distributions in the projectile and target . from the general formula for gluon production(eq .",
    "( [ eq : ktfact ] ) ) , limiting fragmentation is a consequence of two factors :    * unitarity of the @xmath56 matrices which appear in the definition of the unintegrated gluon distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unintbgv ] ) . *",
    "bjorken scaling at large @xmath19 , namely , the fact that the integrated gluon distribution at large @xmath34 , depends only on @xmath19 and not on the scale @xmath165 .",
    "( the residual scale dependence consequently leads to the dependence on the total center - of - mass energy . )",
    "deviations from the limiting curve at experimentally accessible energies are very interesting because they can potentially teach us about how parton distributions evolve at high energies . in the cgc framework , the balitsky  kovchegov equation determines the evolution of the unintegrated parton distributions with energy from an initial scale in @xmath34 chosen to be @xmath133 .",
    "this choice of scale is inspired by model comparisons to the hera data .",
    "we compared our results to data on limiting fragmentation from pp collisions at various experimental facilities over a wide range of collider energies , and to collider data from rhic for deuteron - gold and gold - gold collisions .",
    "we obtained results for two different models of initial conditions at @xmath198 ; the mclerran - venugopalan model ( mv ) and the golec - biernat  wusthoff ( gbw ) model .",
    "in addition to the two parameters in the initial conditions ( @xmath128 and @xmath138 ) , we also studied the sensitivity of our results to an infrared momentum cut - off @xmath154 ( chosen to be the same value in the @xmath199 conversion for hadrons ) .",
    "we found reasonable agreement for this wide range of collider data for the limited set of parameters .",
    "clearly these can be fine tuned by introducing further details about nuclear geometry .",
    "that would introduce further parameters but on the other hand there is more data for different centrality cuts as well - we leave these detailed comparisons for future studies .",
    "in addition , an important effect , which improves agreement with data , is to account for the fragmentation of gluons in hadrons . in particular , the mv model , which has the right leading order large @xmath18 behavior , but no fragmentation effects , is much harder than the data .",
    "the latter falls as a much higher power of @xmath18 .",
    "since even rapidity distributions at higher energies data are more sensitive to larger @xmath18 , we expect this discrepancy to show up in our studies of limiting fragmentation and indeed it does .",
    "we noticed that taking this into account lead to much more plausible extrapolations of fits of existing data to lhc energies .",
    "gluon fragmentation \" contribution also suggests that the  flat \" deviations that we found ( for fits with mv initial conditions ) for @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) are diminished .",
    "clearly , the procedure employed in this paper needs further improvements .",
    "one of them is the impact parameter dependence of the unintegrated gluon distribution functions .",
    "we discussed briefly ",
    "gluon fragmentation \" effects ( with different fragmentation function sets ) which need to be taken into account . furthermore",
    ", large @xmath34 distributions also need to be better constrained and consistency with computations of other final states in the cgc framework established .",
    "finally , the factorization formula used in this paper involves only gluons ; for more realistic estimates , one should also include quark distributions in this framework .",
    "this work was inspired by discussions with a. biaas and l. mclerran and by a seminar at saclay by a. biaas that was attended by fg and rv .",
