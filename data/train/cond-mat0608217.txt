    "downscaling magnetoelectronic devices to the nanometer regime implies that electron - electron interaction effects become prominent , as has been amply demonstrated by many experimental studies on the coulomb blockade in double tunnel junctions with ferromagnetic elements.@xcite much of the theoretical work focusses on f@xmath0n@xmath0f spin valves , in which the island is a normal metal ( n ) and the contacts are ferromagnets ( f ) with variable magnetization directions .",
    "initially , the interest was mainly focussed on the giant magnetoresistance , _",
    "i.e_. the difference in the transport properties for parallel or antiparallel magnetizations.@xcite more recently , the interplay between spin and interaction effects for non - collinear magnetization configurations has attracted quite some interest.@xcite a single - electron spin - valve transistor ( sv - set ) is an f@xmath0n@xmath0f spin - valve with a sufficiently small normal - metal ( n ) island that is coupled to the ferromagnetic leads by tunnel barriers .",
    "when the electrostatic charging energy of the island is larger than the thermal energy , charge transport can be controlled at the level of single electron charges by varying bias and gate voltage , as is well known for non - magnetic sets.@xcite with spin - dependent electron tunneling rates and sufficiently long spin - decay lifetimes , a spin accumulation ( or non - equilibrium magnetization ) that strongly affects electron transport may build up in the nonmagnetic island .    in this article , we discuss the transport characteristics of metallic sv - sets in the coulomb blockade regime , allowing for arbitrary , noncollinear magnetization directions .",
    "in particular , we examine the influence of exchange effects through f@xmath0n tunnel contacts on the spin accumulation in the center island , presenting a more complete discussion compared to that in ref . .",
    "we argue that two separate exchange effects have to be taken into account . on one hand",
    ", there is the non - local interface exchange , let us call it x1  in the following . in scattering theory for non - interacting systems",
    "it is described by the imaginary part of the spin - mixing conductance,@xcite while in the context of current - induced magnetization dynamics x1 acts as an effective field.@xcite such an effective field has been found experimentally to strongly affect the transport dynamics in spin valves with mgo tunnel junctions.@xcite this effect has recently also been involved to explain magnetoresistance effects in carbon nanotube spin valves@xcite and called spin - dependent interface phase shifts.@xcite the second exchange term ( x2 ) is an interaction - dependent exchange effect due to virtual tunneling processes that is absent in non - interacting systems .",
    "it has been considered for islands in the electric quantum limit , in which transport is carried by a single quantized level only.@xcite the x2 effect is potentially attractive for quantum information processing , since it allows to switch on and off effective magnetic fields in arbitrary directions just by a gate electric potential .",
    "we compute here x2 for a metallic island in which size quantization is not important .",
    "we find that both exchange effects are of comparable magnitude and affect the transport properties in a characteristic way , but can be separated in principle by employing the gate dependence of x2 .",

    "an sv - set ( see fig . [ schematic]a ) is composed of a small metallic cluster in contact with two large ferromagnetic electron reservoirs in thermal equilibrium characterized by magnetization directions @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath3 ( for @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    .",

    "the total conductance for contact @xmath11 is then given by @xmath12 and the contact polarization is defined as @xmath13 .",
    "the resistances @xmath14 are taken to be much larger than the resistance quantum @xmath15 , which , at low enough temperatures and bias voltages , allows us to study the  blockade of transport by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the electron tunneling rates are governed by the change of electrostatic energy of the whole circuit upon transfer of an electron .",
    "the capacitances of the junctions @xmath16 determine the charging energy of the island .",
    "we limit our considerations to islands formed by metallic clusters for which the thermal energy ( @xmath17 ) is much larger than the average single - particle energy separation ( reciprocal density of states ) @xmath18 , but much smaller than the single - electron charging energy .",
    "therefore , many levels on the island participate in the transport and we may treat the electronic spectrum as continuous . for a gold cluster with a diameter of 10 @xmath19 , @xmath20 approximately corresponds to a temperature of 2 k. the kondo physics of quantum dots connected to ferromagnetic leads@xcite is suppressed in this regime .",
    "since the currents flowing into and out of the cluster are spin - polarized , the island may become magnetized .",
    "the number of unpaired spins on the island is limited by spin - flip scattering , which we parametrize by a spin - flip relaxation time @xmath21 .",
    "there is evidence from several experiments that the spin - flip times in metallic nanoparticles can be much longer than in bulk systems , which implies that the effects of a spin accumulation on the island should be taken into account.@xcite for later convenience we introduce the spin - flip conductance parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the energy relaxation on the island is fast compared to the electron dwell time .",

    "we discuss the exchange contribution , represented by the hamiltonian @xmath44 , in the next section .",
    "here we discuss two different exchange effects that affect the electrons in the normal metal island attached to magnetic contacts .",
    "these two flavors arise when the transport properties for an sv - set are determined to lowest order in the tunnelling probabilities .",
    "the non - local exchange coupling between ferromagnetic films through a normal metal spacer is an important effect that determines the ground state of magnetic multilayers ( see ref . for a recent review ) .",
    "electrons in a normal metal that are reflected at a contact to a ferromagnet , pick up a phase depending on the electron spin relative to the magnetization direction . in sufficiently clean and narrow f@xmath0n@xmath0f structures ,",
    "quantum well states are formed in n whose energy depend on the magnetic configuration through the spin - dependent phase . by a rotation of the magnetization directions",
    "the energy spectrum and fermi energy varies , causing the ground state energy to depend on the relative angle @xmath7 . in metallic multilayers with a suitable spacer thickness , this can lead to an antiparallel ground state , which displays the celebrated giant magnetoresistance when the magnetizations are forced into a parallel direction by a magnetic field . even when the ground state energies are not significantly affected by the exchange coupling , configuration - dependent quantized states can still be observed in transport .",
    "this has been shown for high - quality planar tunnel junctions@xcite as well as spin valves in which the node is formed by single carbon nanotubes with a quantized energy spectrum.@xcite in ref .",
    "the effect of interfacial phase shifts on the magnetoresistance of ballistic quantum wires between ferromagnetic leads was calculated .",
    "the spin - dependent phase shifts give rise to a slightly different quantization condition , which can spin - split the energy levels .",
    "since we are here interested in classical islands with a continuous electron spectrum , we calculate energy shifts for a semiclassical island using the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule in appendix [ appshifts ] .    here",
    "we consider the limit of tunnel junctions between a normal metallic island and ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "the torques on the ferromagnets are then very small .",
    "the exchange coupling does not significantly disturb the ferromagnets in this limit , but persists to affect transport .",
    "the present study focusses on the charge transport properties in the limit of small tunneling matrix elements , thus from the outset excluding resonant tunneling , co - tunneling or kondo type physics .",
    "the states on the island may be size quantized , _",
    "i.e_. the energy level spacing exceeds the thermal energy ( quantum dot ) , or , in the opposite limit , better described by a semicontinuous density of states ( classical dot ) .",
    "here we concentrate on the latter , _",
    "i.e_. semiclassical , diffuse , or chaotic islands , for which it can be shown quite generally that equilibrium spin currents are suppressed.@xcite the state of the island is then characterized by a semiclassical charge and spin distribution function that has to be determined self - consistently as a function of the junction parameters and the applied voltages . for non - interacting systems ,",
    "the spin and charge currents through an f@xmath0n interface are determined not only by the conventional conductances @xmath9 and @xmath10 introduced above , but also by the complex spin - mixing conductances @xmath45,@xcite which are discussed in sec .",

    ",  the junction parameters such as the interface transparency and spin - mixing conductance are unaffected and the coulomb blockade is governed by the energy conservation criterion only .",
    "this implies that the exchange effect can be described by the @xmath47 of the bare junction .",
    "it remains to parametrize the exchange in the limit of the tunneling hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e_. to lowest order in the interface transmission .",
    "we show below that this is achieved by adding the following exchange term @xmath44 to the hamiltonian for the two leads : @xmath48 the energy shifts @xmath49 , see eq .",
    "( [ shifts ] ) , are proportional to the inverse density of states , but they remain relevant for small level splitting because the dwell time is inversely proportional to the average energy level separation or inverse density of states @xmath50 .",

    "[ spinacc ] .",
    "the interface exchange term x1 is a property of the separate interfaces and they contribute independently .",
    "the second type of exchange ( x2 ) felt by the spins on the island is a property of the entire device .",
    "it originates from virtual tunneling processes , corresponding to single - electron transfer from and to the cluster . in the tunneling regime , this process can be treated and understood in terms of perturbation theory . in the absence of tunneling , the number of electrons on the island is a good quantum number .",
    "the perturbation by the contact to the electrodes allows mixing in of states  in which the number of electrons on the island is changed by unity , at the cost of the charging energy . in second order perturbation theory",
    "this results in an energy gain represented by a sum over ( virtually ) excited states in which the coulomb energy appears in the denominator and the tunneling probability in the numerator . when the leads are non - magnetic , these virtual processes correspond to a quantum correction to the average charge on the central electrode.@xcite this effect depends strongly on the applied gate voltage .",
    "when the unperturbed @xmath51 @xmath52 particle ground state is tuned in energy just above the @xmath53 particle state , the quantum correction will be large and positive ( negative ) . at the degeneracy point ,",
    "perturbation theory breaks down , but the ensuing divergence can be controlled by taking into account finite temperatures .",
    "when the tunneling probabilities to the ferromagnetic contacts are spin dependent , the deviations from the exact quantized charge on the island become spin - dependent , and therefore lead to a net excess of spins in the ground state that depends on the configuration of the contact magnetizations . for a symmetric spin valve it is easy to see that the island ground state magnetization due to these virtual processes x2 is maximal for parallel magnetizations and vanishes for antiparallel ones .",
    "the additional exchange affects non - equilibrium electron transport , in contrast to higher - order so - called co - tunneling processes , to the same order as the in and out - tunneling processes . for a quantum - dot island with a single quantized level , knig and",
    "martinek@xcite showed that in the case of _ non - collinear _ magnetizations the non - equilibrium spins on an island injected by a finite source - drain voltage are dephased by precessing around the effective exchange field .",
