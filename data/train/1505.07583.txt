    "in this paper , we have considered chaotic motions of a classical string in a near penrose limit of ads@xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that sub - leading corrections in a penrose limit provide an unstable separatrix , so that chaotic motions are generated as a consequence of collapsed kam tori . by deriving a reduced system composed of two degrees of freedom with a winding string ansatz",
    ", we have computed poincar sections and provided support for the existence of chaos .",
    "in addition , we have argued that no chaos appears in a near penrose limit of ads@xmath2s@xmath3 , as expected from the classical integrability of the parent system .",
    "there are some open problems associated with the chaos in the ads@xmath0 .",
    "a most important issue is to clarify what kind of gauge - theory operators correspond to the chaotic string solutions .",
    "we have studied here a near penrose limit and hence the associated operators should be almost bps .",
    "that is , a few impurities are inserted into the bps vacuum operator .",
    "hence it seems likely that the problem would now be much easier than the setup discussed in @xcite , because the associated composite operators are quite intricate in the case of the full geometry .",
    "however , we have no definite answer for the operators so far .",
    "we need to make more of an effort , for example , by following the argument for a near penrose limit of ads@xmath2s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it may also be useful to try to figure out a fractal structure associated with the chaos .",
    "probably , one may expect that the impurities would randomly be inserted in the vacuum operator .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge helpful discussions with jun - ichi sakamoto and shin - ichi sasa .",
