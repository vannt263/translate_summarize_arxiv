    "we will follow the method developed by ruffini and bonazzola @xcite .",

    "@xmath18 denotes an average over the ground state of a system of many particles .",
    "its presence refers to the fact that we are working in the semi - classical limit of the einstein s equations .",
    "we will work with units where @xmath19 . in the case of a spherically symmetric , static space - time described by @xmath20 it has been shown that such self - gravitating systems are fully characterized by the scalar field properties , i.e. the mass @xmath0 of the scalar field and its energy density potential @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the resulting object and the typical radius depend mainly on these two properties of the scalar field .",
    "the axion is no exception . to deal with the quantum nature of the axion field",
    ", we have to compute the average @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ einstein ] ) . what is usually done is to quantize the scalar field @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the usual creation ( annihilation ) operators for a particle with angular momentum @xmath26 , azimuthal momentum @xmath0 and energy @xmath27 .",
    "these operators satisfy the usual commutation relations @xmath28=[\\mu_{nlm}^-,\\mu_{n'l'm'}^-]=0 $ ] and @xmath29=\\delta_{n n'}\\delta_{l l'}\\delta_{m m'}$ ] . with the operator @xmath30",
    ", it is now possible to construct the energy - momentum tensor operator @xmath31 just by inserting the operator @xmath32 into the classical expression for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath33 the average @xmath34 is done by considering a state @xmath35 for which all @xmath10 particles are in the ground state ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the ground state satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "this procedure , as pointed out in @xcite , cancels all time dependence on the vacuum expectation value @xmath34 and , for the case of a free scalar field ( @xmath39 ) , the real quantized scalar field yields the same field equations as those obtained by using a classical complex scalar field . at this level , the self - gravitating system for a real quantized scalar field does not differ from a complex classical scalar field , hence , a real quantized scalar field does not produce the so called `` oscillatons '' @xcite , which are time - dependent .",
    "in our case we are interested in the axion potential ( [ potential ] ) . in order to compute @xmath40",
    ", we perform a taylor expansion of ( [ potential ] ) , i.e. @xmath41 we will show that the final results do not depend strongly on the number of terms considered in the taylor expansion of ( [ potential ] ) . the relevant term that should be considered is the self - interacting term @xmath13 and the sign it carries with itself , which differs from the one considered in boson stars ( bs ) @xcite . with the potential ( [ taylor ] ) , it is possible to compute @xmath42 by performing the quantization and averaging procedure previously discussed .",
    "the computed average of the stress energy tensor is @xmath43 we have dropped all sub - indexes since , as we have already pointed out , we will assume that the axion is in its ground state .",
    "we can observe that there is no time dependence in ( [ vacuum ] ) .",
    "furthermore , there are new numerical factors that appear due to the averaging performed in @xmath44 @xcite . for instance",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 , in such a way that we can not recover the original @xmath47 from which we departed .",
    "following a similar procedure but now applied to the scalar wave equation ( [ kg ] ) , with a potential ( [ taylor ] ) and the spherically symmetric metric ( [ metric ] ) , the einstein - klein - gordon system is obtained : @xmath48&=&0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following standard definitions @xcite , we rewrite the system ( [ sistema ] ) in dimensionless variables : @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and we have found it convenient to define the dimensionless self - interaction term @xmath52 by imposing regularity at the origin and flatness at infinity , system ( [ sistema ] ) is solved using a shooting method . even though the set of equations ( [ sistema ] ) is very similar to the case for typical bs , @xcite ,",
    "the behavior we found for the family of solutions with zero - nodes is completely different . a full set of equilibrium configurations",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ masses ] , where the gravitational mass is plotted for different values of @xmath53 and @xmath12 .",
    "the equilibrium configurations have a maximum mass @xmath54 at some @xmath55 for each value of @xmath12 .",
    "but the switch in the potential sign of the @xmath13 term produces a significant change in the behavior of @xmath54 in comparison with standard bs @xcite .",
    "the relation @xmath56 is no longer satisfied .",
    "instead of increasing @xmath54 as we increase the value of @xmath12 , we found a decreasing @xmath54 .     and compactness for different configurations .",
    "the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath12 is negligible . for a given value of @xmath53 , the compactness decreases as @xmath12 increases.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this effect",
    "is expected since instead of adding a repulsive interaction between the particles of the system , the change in the sign due to the cosine - like potential ( [ potential ] ) implies an attractive potential .",
    "thus the total number of particles needed to form an equilibrium configuration that balance the gravitational collapse against the quantum pressure is lower than the case of a repulsive potential .",
    "one can think that this effect is apparent and as soon as the complete potential ( [ potential ] ) is implemented in the ekg system , a different behavior would be seen .",
    "but the decrease in the mass of the equilibrium configurations is a robust behavior .",
    "the masses of equilibrium configurations including up to the fourth power of @xmath58 in the taylor series are plotted also in fig .",
    "[ masses ] , illustrating this robustness .",
    "the bigger the value of @xmath12 , the lower the differences on the masses .",
    "this is because when @xmath12 is increased , @xmath59 decreases ( and equivalently @xmath60 where we are interested ) .",
    "then , the true expansion parameter of ( [ potential ] ) is @xmath61 , an it is always a small parameter .",
    "another interesting issue is that the dependence of the radius @xmath57 ( defined as the radius where @xmath62 of the total gravitational mass is reached ) on the value of @xmath12 is weak , as it is shown in upper panel of fig .",
    "[ compactness ] . combining the invariance of the radius as @xmath12 increases , with the decrease in the mass",
    ", means that the self - gravitating system made of a scalar field that has an axion - like potential has a lower compactness ( @xmath63 ) as the self - interaction term increases .",
    "this `` newtonization '' of the system is shown on the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ compactness ] .",
    "and an axion mass of @xmath64ev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the previous results where obtained assuming arbitrary values of the mass @xmath0 of the scalar field associated with the axion as well as free values for the decay constant @xmath1 .",
    "but the mass of the axion is constrained by astrophysical and cosmological considerations to lie in the range @xmath65 and the decay constant is related to the axion mass by @xmath66 @xcite with these two restriction we have @xmath67 and then , the previous selection of dimensionless variables @xmath68 ) is now inadequate in order to numerically solve the system ( [ sistema ] ) .",
    "after some frustrated attempts , we found that a more suitable set of variables to solve the system ( [ sistema ] ) is the following : @xmath69 since @xmath70 , it is natural to think that the resulting axion star will have a small compactness and low mass .",
    "so , besides the change in variables ( [ variables ] ) , it is convenient to solve for @xmath71 . solving the system ( [ sistema ] ) for the new set of variables @xmath72 we obtained typical nodeless configurations for these axion stars .",
    "some of them are shown in fig .",
    "[ axionstar ] , where we have taken an axion mass @xmath73ev .",
    "a possible scenario emerges with the hypothesis that dm is mainly composed by axions . as was already pointed out by kolb and tkachev @xcite",
    ", nonlinear effects in the evolution of the axion field in the early universe may lead to the formation of `` axion miniclusters '' .",
    "these miniclusters may relax , due to the collisional @xmath74 process or by gravitational cooling @xcite , and they will evolve to a bs . in the present work we have constructed those bss for axion particles by solving the ekg system for a real quantized scalar field which is regulated by an axion - potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "these self - gravitating systems , the axion stars , have very small masses and radii of meters ( table [ physicalvalues ] ) and consequently very low compactnesses .",
    "the resulting densities are not enough to produce stimulated decays of the axion to photons since they occur when @xmath75 which implies densities @xmath76 kg/ m@xmath77 for @xmath73ev @xcite .",
    "typical densities for axion stars are shown in table [ physicalvalues ] .",
    "the galactic halo will be an ensemble of axion stars and this picture is not in contradiction with observations since the size of axions stars fit into the limits coming from microlensing or gravothermal instability @xcite .",
    "previous studies that construct models for galactic dark matter halos out of scalar fields assume that each galactic halo is a spherical bose - einstein condensate made of an ultra - light scalar field @xcite . in the present work",
    ", the axion stars will play the role of the scalar field mini - machos , that is , a scenario where the scalar field ( the axion ) form a large number of stable asteroid - sized scalar condensations which end up clustering into structures similar to cdm halos with all their advantages .",
    "the stability of structures made of scalar fields have been extensively studied @xcite , and those analysis could be extended to our case with potential energy density given by ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "if dm is distributed as axion stars , their detection will be very difficult .",
    "the proposed femptolensing to detect axion compact objects @xcite is close to its lower detectable limit .",
    "another related issue is the low number of axion stars around the earth .",
    "assuming for instance a navarro - frenk - white profile for the galactic halo , and a local halo density of @xmath78cm@xmath77 around the sun , there will be @xmath80 axion star in the volume cover between jupiter and the sun . nevertheless",
    ", another axion properties can shed light on the axion , such as the conversion of axions into photons in the presence of strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "collisions of axion stars with neutron stars @xcite will produce flashes of light that could be detected by gamma ray observatories @xcite . a more detailed analysis of these ideas together with a more detailed study of the stability of the axion stars could help us to determine if dm is mainly composed by scalar field particles as the axions .",
