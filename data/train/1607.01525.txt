    "recent years have seen a surge of modelling particle dynamics from a discrete potential theoretic perspective .",
    "the models , which usually run under the heading _ aggregation models _ , in particular cases boil down to ( harmonic / poisson ) redistribution of a given initial mass ( sandpile ) according to some prescribed governing rules .",
    "the most famous and well - known model is the poincar s balayage , where a given initial mass distribution @xmath2 ( in a given domain @xmath3 ) is to be redistributed ( or mapped ) to another distribution @xmath4 on the boundary of the domain @xmath5 where @xmath4 is uniquely defined through @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "this model uses continuous amounts of mass instead of discrete ones ; the latter is more common in chip firing on graphs ( see @xcite for instance ) .    a completely different model called _ partial - balayage _ ( see @xcite ) aims at finding a body ( domain ) that is gravi - equivalent with the given initial mass .",
    "this problem , in turn , is equivalent to variational inequalities and the so - called obstacle problem .",
    "the discrete version of this problem was ( probably for the first time ) studied by d. zidarov , where he performed ( what is now called ) a _ divisible sandpile _ model ; see @xcite page 108 - 118 .",
    "levine @xcite , and levine - peres @xcite , @xcite started a systematic study of such problems , proving , among other things , existence of scaling limit for divisible sandpiles .",
    "although zidarov was the first to consider such a problem , the mathematical rigour is to be attributed to levine @xcite , and levine - peres @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the divisible sandpile , which is of particular relevance to our paper , is a growth model on @xmath0 @xmath6 which amounts to redistribution of a given continuous mass .",
    "the redistribution of mass takes place according to a ( given ) simple rule : each lattice point can , and eventually must topple if it already has more than a prescribed amount of mass ( sand ) .",
    "the amount to topple is the excess , which is divided between all the neighbouring lattice points equally or according to a governing background pde . the scaling limit of this model , when the lattice spacing tends to 0 , and the amount of mass is scaled properly , leads to the _ obstacle problem _ in @xmath7 @xmath6 .",
    "the divisible sandpile model of zidarov , and levine - peres also relates to a well - known problem in potential theory , the so - called quadrature domains ( qd ) @xcite . a quadrature domain @xmath3 ( with respect to a given measure @xmath2 ) is a domain that has the same exterior newtonian potential ( with uniform density ) as that of the measure @xmath2 .",
    "hence , potential theoretically @xmath2 and @xmath8 are equivalent in the free space ; i.e. outside the support of @xmath3 one has @xmath9 , where these are the newtonian potentials of @xmath2 , respectively @xmath8 .",
    "the odometer function @xmath10 of levine - peres ( which represents the amount of mass emitted from each lattice site ) corresponds to the difference between the above potentials ( up to a normalization constant ) , i.e. @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",
    "this , expressed differently , means that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 harmonic and integrable over @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in many other ( related ) free boundary value problems ( known as bernoulli type ) the zero boundary gradient @xmath17 in the above takes a different turn , and is a prescribed ( strictly ) non - zero function , and the volume potential @xmath18 in is replaced by surface / single layer potential ( of the a priori unknown domain ) @xmath19 . in terms of sandpile redistribution",
    "this means to find a domain @xmath3 such that the given initial mass @xmath2 in is replaced by a prescribed mass @xmath20 on @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is the standard surface measure on @xmath21 , and @xmath23 a given function ; for the simplest case @xmath24 the counterpart of would be @xmath25 for all @xmath16 harmonic on a neighbourhood of @xmath26 .",
    "such domains are referred to as quadrature surfaces , with corresponding pde @xmath27 with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a normalization constant .",
    "this problem is well - studied in the continuum case and there is a large amount of literature concerning existence , regularity and geometric properties of both solutions and the free boundary , see @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .    in our search",
    "to find a model for the sandpile particle dynamics to model we came across a few models that we ( naively ) thought could and should be the answer to our quest .",
    "however , running numerical simulations ( without any theoretical attempts ) it became apparent that the models we suggested are far from the bernoulli type free boundaries admitting quadrature identity , in continuum case , should be a sphere . ] .",
    "in particular , redistribution of an initial point mass does not converge ( numerically ) to a sphere , but to a shape with a boundary remotely resembling the boundary of the abelian sandpile ( see figure [ fig-1 ] ; cf .",
    "* figure 1 ) , or ( * ? ? ? * figure 2 ) for instance ) .",
    "[ fig : sub1 ]     [ fig : sub2 ]     [ fig : sub1 ]     [ fig : sub2 ]    notwithstanding this , our model seems to present a new alluring and fascinating phenomenon not considered earlier , neither by combinatorics nor free boundary communities . hence the  birth \" of this article .",
    "since the boundary of a set will be a prime object in the analysis of the paper , we will assume throughout the text that @xmath1 to avoid uninteresting cases .",
    "given an initial mass @xmath2 on @xmath0 , we want to find a model that builds a domain @xmath30 such that the corresponding ( discrete ) balayage measure @xmath4 on the boundary @xmath21 ( see ) is prescribed .",
    "such a model seems for the moment infeasible for us .",
    "a slight variation of it asks to find a ",
    "canonical \" domain such that the boundary mass @xmath4 stays below the prescribed threshold .",
    "since larger domains ( with reasonable geometry ) have larger boundaries , and hence a greater amount of boundary points , we should expect that one can always find a solution to our problem by taking a very large domain containing the initial mass .",
    "this , in particular , suggests that a canonical domain should be the smallest domain among all domains with the property that the boundary mass @xmath4 is below the prescribed mass , which we shall assume to be uniform mass .",
    "results in a so - called bernoulli free boundary problem , where the green s potential @xmath31 of the mass @xmath2 , in the sought domain @xmath3 , has boundary gradient @xmath32 , in case of uniform distribution , i.e. @xmath33 . ]    departing from the above point of view of canonicity one may ask whether there is a natural lattice growth model which corresponds to this minimality . with @xmath34 . ]",
    "it turns out that there actually is a model which seemingly is more complicated than the divisible sandpile model described above . to introduce our model , which we call _ boundary sandpile _",
    ", we need a few formal definitions ) , we think it might be more convenient without any further specification with descriptive names to use the term boundary sandpile . ] .",
    "through the text various letters @xmath35 will stand for constants which may change from formulae to formula .",
    "we use lower case @xmath36 to denote small constants , and upper case @xmath37 for large constants .      call two lattice points @xmath38 _ neighbours _ and write @xmath39 if @xmath40 , where @xmath41-norm of @xmath42 is the sum of absolute values of its coordinates .",
    "clearly @xmath39 iff @xmath43 for some @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath46-th vector of the standard basis of @xmath7 . for any non - empty set @xmath47",
    ", this concept of lattice adjacency induces a natural graph @xmath48 having vertices on @xmath49 .",
    "we call such @xmath48 the _ lattice graph _ of @xmath49",
    ".    next , for a set @xmath47 define @xmath50 and call them respectively the * boundary * of @xmath49 and the * interior * of @xmath49 . for the convenience of the exposition we have chosen to include the boundary into the set .    for @xmath51 recall the definition of the _ discrete laplace operator _ denoted by @xmath52 and acting on a function @xmath53 by @xmath54 , \\qquad x\\in h{{\\mathbb z}}^d,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , as for @xmath56 , means that @xmath57 is a neighbour of @xmath58 in the lattice @xmath59 . throughout the text , when @xmath56 , i.e. on a unit scale lattice , we will write @xmath60 for @xmath61 unless explicitly stated otherwise",
    ".    for @xmath62 we set @xmath63 for the closed discrete ball of radius @xmath64 including its 1-neighbourhood .",
    "it is clear from the definition that @xmath65 is from the interior of @xmath66 iff @xmath67 .",
    "let now @xmath68 be a given ( mass ) distribution on @xmath0 , i.e. a non - negative function supported on finitely many sites of @xmath0 .",
    "fix also a threshold @xmath69 . for each integer",
    "@xmath70 we inductively construct a sequence of sets @xmath71 , mass distributions @xmath72 , and functions @xmath73 as follows .",
    "start with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for an integer time @xmath70 a particular site @xmath65 is called * unstable * if either of the following holds :    * @xmath76 and @xmath77 , * @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "otherwise a site is called * stable*. we call the number @xmath80 the * ( boundary ) capacity * of the model and refer to @xmath71 as the set of _ visited sites _ at time @xmath81 .",
    "any unstable site can _ topple _ by distributing all its mass equally among its @xmath82 lattice neighbours .",

    "we call @xmath73 the _ odometer _ function at time @xmath81 . for the sake of convenience",
    ", we do allow the toppling to be applied to a stable site , as an identity operator , i.e. if at time @xmath81 a toppling is applied to a stable site @xmath58 , then we set @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we say that toppling @xmath58 is _ legal _ , if @xmath58 is unstable .",
    "if for some @xmath81 there are no unstable sites , the process is terminated .",
    "we call this model * boundary sandpile * ( @xmath94 ) and denote by @xmath95 , where @xmath68 is the initial distribution , and @xmath80 is the boundary capacity of the model .    it is clear that the triple @xmath96 may depend on the choice of the unstable sites , i.e. the toppling sequence . later on",
    "we will see that for a suitable class of toppling sequences stable configurations exist and are identical ( see propositions [ prop - stabil - toppling ] and [ prop - abelian ] ) .",
    "observe that from the definition of discrete laplacian and ( [ mu - k+1-def ] ) we easily see that for each @xmath70 one has @xmath97 i.e. the laplacian of @xmath73 represents the net gain of mass for a site @xmath58 at time @xmath81 .",

    ".      our main results concern general qualitative analysis of the boundary sandpile model , introduced in this paper . for any initial mass distribution",
    "we prove well - posedness of the model ( propositions [ prop - stabil - toppling ] and [ prop - abelian ] ) , and canonical representation of the model in terms of the smallest super - solution among a certain class of functions ( theorem [ thm - canonical ] ) . specifying our analysis for point masses and using this minimality of the model ,",
    "we show directional monotonicity of the odometer function ( theorem [ thm - monotonicity ] ) .",
    "we then determine the reasonable size of the boundary capacity ( subsection [ sub - sec - heuristics ] ) and estimate the growth rate of the model in lemma [ lem - balls - inside - out ] .",
    "we prove a uniform lipschitz bound for the scaled odometer function in proposition [ lem - lipschitz - est ] . using these results obtained in discrete setting , in the final part of the paper , section [ sec - shape - analysis ] we study the scaling limit of the model in continuum space .",
    "in particular , we show that ( along a subsequence ) the scaled odometers , and hence the visited sites , converge to a continuum limit ( theorem [ thm - scaling - limit ] parts ( i ) and ( iii ) ) .",
    "we also prove that the free boundary of ( any ) scaling limit of the model is locally a lipschitz graph ( theorem [ thm - scaling - limit ] part ( v ) ) .",
    "in subsection [ subsec - asm ] we apply our methods developed for boundary sandpile model to classical abelian sandpile .",
    "most notably , we show that the boundary of the scaling limit of abelian sandpile corresponding to initial configuration of chips at a single vertex , has lipschitz boundary .",
    "[ rem - general - f ] it is worthwhile to remark that the boundary sandpile described above can be represented slightly different , using discrete partial derivatives . indeed , our model generates a set @xmath47 whose green s function @xmath10 ( corresponding to the given initial distribution of mass ) satisfies @xmath103 for a given @xmath104 , where @xmath105 . in light of this observation one may consider a wider class of problems in terms of general prescribed boundary mass given by @xmath106 , where @xmath107 defined on @xmath108 has to satisfy some properties ( ellipticity and other ) , yet to be found .",
    "the methods developed in this paper seem to have a good chance to go through for at least  nice enough \" function @xmath107 .",
    "this aspect we shall leave for interested reader to explore .",
    "in this section we prove two basic properties of the boundary sandpile model .",
    "namely , that the model needs to visit a finite number of sites in @xmath0 to reach a stable state , and that the final stable configuration is independent of the toppling sequence . for the proofs we will use some ideas from (",

    "[ prop - stabil - toppling ] for a given @xmath95 any infinitive toppling sequence @xmath99 is stabilizing .    let @xmath109 be the total mass of the sandpile , and set @xmath110 . for each @xmath111 let @xmath71 be the set of visited sites after invoking @xmath81-th toppling in @xmath99 .",

    "observe , that in view of ( b ) and lemma [ lem - balls - inside - out ] there is @xmath728 small such that the ball @xmath771 .",
    "using this and the definition of @xmath737 we have @xmath772 but since both @xmath737 and @xmath773 converge locally uniformly away from 0 to continuous functions , then the difference @xmath774 on @xmath775 for all @xmath111 where @xmath776 is some large constant .",
    "by dmp we get that @xmath774 in @xmath777 , hence , the limit @xmath778 is also bounded by @xmath37 in @xmath779 . but as @xmath780 in @xmath779 we get that @xmath781 is a removable singularity for @xmath782 , in particular @xmath783 at 0 , and the proof of part ( ii ) is now complete .",
    "it remains to show ( v ) , the last assertion of the theorem .",
    "we will show that at each @xmath784 there exists a double cone , with its size ( opening and height ) independent of @xmath622 , having vertex at @xmath622 and intersecting @xmath785 at @xmath622 only is the 0-level set of @xmath278 which is a lipschitz function on compact subsets away from the origin , and in particular in a neighbourhood of @xmath324 .",
    "but this fact alone is not enough to conclude that @xmath324 is lipschitz , see for instance @xcite . ] .",
    "this clearly implies ( v ) .    applying the monotonicity of ( iv ) in directions",
    "@xmath786 we obtain @xmath787 for all @xmath42 . due to this symmetry , to prove ( v ) it is enough to treat the part of @xmath324 where all coordinates are non - negative .",
    "in addition , we will also assume that the point @xmath788 satisfies @xmath789 for all @xmath790 .",
    "the rest of the cases are similar .",
    "observe that due to ( iii ) and lemma [ lem - balls - inside - out ] there is a constant @xmath590 such that @xmath791 now the choice of @xmath622 and ( [ ball - inside ] ) together imply @xmath792    we first determine a certain monotonicity region for @xmath622 .",
    "let @xmath793 be a finite set of vectors containing @xmath612 and having the rest of its elements chosen by the following rule : for each @xmath794      it is easy to check from definition of @xmath267 that it contains @xmath523 linearly independent vectors .",
    "for a given @xmath800 consider the halfspace @xmath801 .",
    "we have the following monotonicity of @xmath278 in @xmath802 .",
    "indeed , decomposing @xmath804 into tangential and normal components in @xmath802 , one gets @xmath805 , where @xmath164 , @xmath806 and @xmath807 is the same for both @xmath808 due to assumption .",
    "then , @xmath809 , hence @xmath367 if and only if @xmath810",

    "it remains to apply the monotonicity result of part ( iv ) to get .",
    "we thus obtain that @xmath278 is non - increasing in @xmath802 in the normal direction .      as a direct corollary of ( [ mono - plane ] ) the cone",
    "@xmath816 inherits the following property .",
    "if @xmath817 and @xmath818 where @xmath819 , @xmath820 for all @xmath493 , and @xmath821 is the cardinality of @xmath267 , then @xmath822    along with @xmath823 consider as well the cone generated by @xmath267 @xmath824 since @xmath267 has @xmath523 linearly independent vectors , the cone @xmath825 is @xmath523-dimensional .",
    "we claim that @xmath826 is the sought cone , for which we need to show that the truncated cone @xmath816 has uniform size and that @xmath278 is positive in the interior of @xmath816 and is zero in the interior of @xmath827",
    ". we will only show the former claim , as the latter follows similarly .",
    "it is clear , thanks to ( [ x-0-is - inside ] ) , that @xmath816 is of uniform size .",
    "now assume for contradiction , that there is @xmath828 such that @xmath829 .",
    "consider the cone @xmath830 .",
    "let us see that @xmath831 the first assertion of ( [ 2claims ] ) follows directly from since @xmath832 by definition and any element @xmath833 is from @xmath823 as well , and has the form @xmath834 with all @xmath819 .",
    "the second one is simply a consequence of the definition of @xmath372 .",
    "armed with ( [ 2claims ] ) the proof of ( v ) follows readily , since we simply get that @xmath278 is zero in an open neighbourhood of @xmath622 , which violates the condition that @xmath835 .",
    "this contradiction finishes the proof of ( v ) , and the proof of the theorem is now complete .",
    "assertion ( a ) follows from convergence result of pegden - smart discussed in subsection [ subsec - asm ] in conjunction with theorem [ thm - monotonicity - asm ] . the proof of part ( b ) follows from part ( a ) by the same argument as for part ( v ) of theorem [ thm - scaling - limit ] .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "it is clear from the proof of theorem [ thm - scaling - limit ] that for any sequence of scalings @xmath836 , where @xmath837 , one may extract a subsequence @xmath838 such that the corresponding sequence of scaled odometers will have a limit , call it @xmath839 , satisfying the same properties as the function @xmath278 of theorem [ thm - scaling - limit ] .",
    "in particular , by theorem [ thm - scaling - limit ] ( ii ) we have that any such @xmath839 is @xmath840 on the set where it is positive , and is lipschitz continuous up to the boundary of that set . however , we do not know if scaling limits generated by different scaling sequences must coincide .    for several lattice - growth models",
    "the existence of scaling limit , and in some cases its geometry , are known ; for divisible sandpile see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for rotor - router see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and for abelian sandpile see @xcite . the internal diffusion limited aggregation ( idla ) , which is a stochastic growth model ,",

    ", one may consult @xcite .",
    "growth models involving continuous amounts of mass similar to divisible sandpile model , are studied in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , where the last paper considers a non - abelian growth model .",
    "it is interesting to observe , that the strong flat patterns appearing on the boundary of a sandpile as can be seen in figure [ fig-1 ] , might be a result of a significant increase of the role of the free boundary , rather than the pde problem in the interior .",
    "it is remarkable that a similar geometry of the boundary as in figure [ fig-1 ] , in particular the flatness , arises also from the classical abelian sandpile , see figure [ fig-2 ] , if one treats the boundary of the growth cluster likewise , i.e. allowing each boundary point to accumulate many particles however not exceeding the given threshold .",
    "nevertheless , the pde problem of the abelian sandpile in the set of visited sites , is very different from that of the boundary sandpile considered here .",
    "it seems very interesting to understand the emergence of the flatness on the boundary rigorously .",
    "yet another surprising property of the boundary sandpile is the discontinuity of its geometry under small perturbations of the initial mass distribution , and a certain tendency of the sandpile dynamics towards generating convex sets ( see figure [ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "a rigorous explanation of these phenomena seems to be a very interesting problem .",
    "* problem 3 .",
    "* is there a boundary sandpile type process , leading to that the total mass of the system is being redistributed onto the combinatorial free boundary ( possibly with a different background rules ) which has a sphere as its scaling limit ?",
    "in fact , this problem does not exclude , as a possible candidate , the boundary sandpile process considered in this paper .",
    "it is apparent from numerical simulations ( see figure [ fig-1 ] ) , that the shape of @xmath94 divaricates from a sphere . however , we do not have a rigorous proof of this fact .",
