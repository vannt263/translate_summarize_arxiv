    "we say that two such singularities are isomorphic if the completions of their local rings are isomorphic to each other . a morphism @xmath4 is called a log resolution if it is a proper birational morphism from an nonsingular surface @xmath5 and its exceptional locus @xmath6 is a simple normal crossing divisor .",

    "lee and nakayama @xcite proved in arbitrary characteristics that @xmath25 is taut if it is a chain with all genera zero .",
    "artin s list of rational double points ( rdp ) @xcite tells us that there are both taut rdps and non - taut rdps in positive characteristics    @xmath2-singularities are important classes of singularities in positive characteristics .",
    "as one of these singularities , @xmath2-regular singularities were introduced by hochster and huneke @xcite in the theory of tight closure .",
    "they can be regarded as a characteristic @xmath30 analogue of log terminal singularities because log terminal singularities over @xmath1 become @xmath2-regular after reduction to modulo @xmath31 @xcite @xcite @xcite . on the other hand , observing laufer s list , we can see log terminal singularities over @xmath1 are all taut .",

    "some information is omitted compared to hara s version @xcite , but it does not matter in almost all cases .    note that if @xmath0 has only a rational singularity , every irreducible component of @xmath14 is isomorphic to the projective line @xmath54 .",
