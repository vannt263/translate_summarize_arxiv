    "the manipulation of microscopic particles has benefited from the high level of control and measurement provided by optical tweezers . with the technological development of fast configurable spatial light modulators ( slms ) allowing for ever more complex trapping geometries  @xcite , new applications have emerged .",
    "for example , sculpted light may have an important role in overcoming multiple light scattering issues in complex biological tissues , and such biomedical applications have only begun to be explored .",
    "in particular the development of sculpted light patterns across the image plane , such as the generation of large trapping arrays , could have application to the in vivo trapping of larger objects , such as living cells  @xcite .        in degenerate quantum gases ,",
    "the push for increasing diversification of optical trapping potentials has led to the adoption of many of the techniques from holographic optical tweezers .",
    "slms are most often used in the fourier plane of an optical system , manipulating the phase of an input optical field to produce a configurable pattern in the conjugate trapping plane of the system  @xcite .",
    "these methods have been successfully applied to address and pattern atoms trapped in optical lattices  @xcite , but demonstrations of microscopically configurable trapping potentials have been lacking , with a notable exception being the production of multiple focused spots for the confinement of single atoms  @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique to manipulating the phase of the input beam is to instead utilise direct imaging .",
    "though somewhat rarely encountered in optical tweezers , the technique known as _ generalised phase constrast _ uses the combination of a phase - based slm and a phase - contrast filter to first create an amplitude pattern in an intermediate image plane , which is then directly reimaged to the optical tweezing plane  @xcite .",
    "the advantages of this technique are both speed and simplicity  the desired amplitude pattern can be directly written to the slm without requiring the calculation of the appropriate hologram .",
    "this technique likewise avoids the generation of phase defects and speckle in the imaged pattern that can plague slms in the fourier plane  @xcite , while being adaptable to the generation of large numbers of traps  @xcite .",
    "this comes at the cost of the ability to correct wavefront aberrations , but this disadvantage can be mitigated with a well - corrected optical system , as shown here .",
    "another drawback is that the light efficiency is proportional to the fraction of illuminated trap area to maximum trap area .",
    "a more recent addition to the toolkit for producing arbitrary optical potentials has been the digital - micromirror device ( dmd ) .",
    "consisting of ( up to ) millions of individually addressable mirrors in a compact package , dmds have the advantage of fast full - frame refresh rates on the order of 20  khz , @xmath1 that of comparable liquid - crystal based slms .",
    "dmds can also be operated in a fixed fashion ( dc ) as they latch mirrors between reset pulses .",
    "originally developed for digital light processing ( dlp ) , these devices have seen increasing use in laboratory and industrial applications  @xcite .",
    "a dmd can be considered a dynamically configurable amplitude mask , which makes it highly suitable for direct imaging applications .",
    "dmds have been used to produce flattop beams for implementation into quantum gas experiments  @xcite , incorporated into high - resolution systems for the purpose of single - site addressing in atomic quantum gas microscopes  @xcite , used to produce moving lattice potentials  @xcite , and have recently been utilised to produce target - shaped traps  @xcite .",
    "dmds may be used in either the fourier plane  @xcite or directly imaged  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate here the utility of direct imaging of a dmd at high numerical apertures ( na ) for optical trapping , which we apply to trapping of a bec .",
    "our optical system has the major advantage of using commercially available optics and microscope objectives external to our glass vacuum chamber , and corrected for the relatively thin 1.25  mm thick walls . with this system",
    "we demonstrate patterning of potentials with an upper - bound resolution of 630(10 )  nm fwhm at 532  nm illumination , within 5% of the diffraction limit for our 0.45  na objective and @xmath2 improved on recently reported results  @xcite which utilised a relatively low @xmath3  na imaging system .",
    "the high - resolution potentials appear robust to tilts and misalignments of the objective and glass walls , in contrast to other cold atom experiments  @xcite .",
    "these patterns have an image extent of @xmath4 in the atom plane , which allows nearly arbitrary sculpting of the optical potential and corresponding bec .",
    "subsequent imaging at the 780  nm resonant wavelength of @xmath5rb achieves a submicron resolution of 960(80 )  nm fwhm , within 8% of the diffraction limit .",
    "our dmd allows the storage of 13,889 frames and has a full - frame frame rate ranging from dc to 20  khz , enabling diverse and dynamically configurable potentials .",
    "we utilise this rapid switching rate to introduce the use of dmds for producing time - averaged potentials , which have been previously produced from rapidly scanning beams  @xcite .",
    "we find that modulation frequencies above @xmath6  khz produce negligible heating of the atoms while allowing the production of six grayscale levels .",
    "this technique can be combined with binary error - diffusion ( halftoning )  @xcite to increase the number of grayscale levels available .",
    "our apparatus consists of a three - part vacuum system , comprising a two - dimensional magneto - optical trap ( 2dmot ) , three - dimensional mot ( 3dmot ) and attached science cell cuvette ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_apparatus ] ) .",
    "the cell is made of suprasil quartz and has 1.25 mm thick walls with an external broadband anti - reflection coating .",
    "the 2dmot is separated from the 3dmot and science cell sections with a 12  mm long differential pumping tube with a 1.2  mm inner diameter .",
    "this results in a pressure differential of @xmath7 , with a pressure of @xmath8  torr and @xmath9  torr on the 3dmot and 2dmot sides respectively .",
    "the 2dmot loads @xmath10 @xmath5rb atoms into the 3dmot in 5  s. the subsequent bec production closely follows the methodology of ref .  @xcite .",
    "after a 40  ms compressed mot stage ( cmot )  @xcite , the atoms are optically pumped to the @xmath11 manifold and captured in a 100  g / cm quadrupole magnetic field . using two additional anti - helmoltz coil pairs  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig_apparatus ] ) , the atoms are adiabatically transferred to the science cell in @xmath12  s  @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole field is subsequently increased to 145  g / cm , and evaporation occurs over 4  s by driving the microwave transition from @xmath13 , resulting in a cloud of @xmath14 atoms at a temperature of @xmath15k .",
    "the field is then relaxed to 27 g / cm , loading @xmath16 atoms at @xmath17k into a red - detuned 1064  nm beam with a @xmath18 m waist , aligned @xmath19 m below the quadrupole zero , and with a potential depth of 110  @xmath20 .",
    "we find that the cancellation of stray magnetic fields is important for efficient loading of the dipole trap .",
    "optical evaporation is performed by reducing the beam intensity , resulting in a temperature of @xmath21  nk , with a critical temperature for condensation of @xmath22  nk .",
    "if the optical evaporation is continued , becs of @xmath23 atoms can be produced in this trap .",
    "instead , we load the cold thermal atoms into a second 1064 nm red - detuned beam focused into a sheet with radial and vertical waists ( @xmath24 ) = ( 1  mm , 8.5  @xmath25 m ) and a trap depth of 6.4  @xmath20 .",
    "subsequent evaporation in the sheet - magnetic hybrid trap results in a bec of @xmath26 atoms in a highly flattened geometry , with final trapping frequencies of @xmath27  hz .",
    "after evaporating in the sheet hybrid trap , we subsequently remove the magnetic field , while ramping up the sheet potential , resulting in all - optical confinement with @xmath28  hz .",
    "the addition of the dmd potential to the sheet ( see below ) can dominate the weak radial harmonic confinement of this trap , producing nearly uniform atomic distributions .",
    "in order to produce arbitrarily patterned becs , we directly image a dmd ( visitech luxbeam 4600 wuxga 1200@xmath291920 pixels ) to the atom plane by illuminating the surface with spatially - filtered 532  nm light as shown in fig .  [ fig_imaging ] .",
    "this results in approximately gaussian illumination with @xmath30  mm and maximum dmd diffraction efficiency of @xmath31  40% . an intermediate image of the dmd with @xmath32 magnification is initially produced using a matched achromat imaging system .",
    "an aperture at the fourier plane of this system removes spurious dmd diffraction orders , which otherwise contribute stray light to the dark regions of the imaged patterns and reduce the trap lifetime .",
    "subsequently , the dmd is imaged to the atom plane using a 500  mm achromat and nikon cfi l plan epi 20xcr infinity corrected objective , resulting in @xmath33 magnification .",
    "the total system thus images the dmd to the atom plane with a final minimization factor of 100 ( @xmath34 magnification ) .",
    "the objective has a numerical aperture ( na ) of 0.45 and an adjustable glass correction collar .",
    "we have found the correction collar to be important in obtaining high - resolution patterns inside the science cell , but the system is relatively insensitive to the precise angle of the objective and only requires coarse tuning .     magnification and 532  nm illumination , resulting in 650(50 )  nm fwhm ( @xmath35  nm ) .",
    "the fwhm was determined through 100 1d fits of the image at varying angles through 180 degrees ; a single 1d fit is shown here for illustrative purposes .",
    "( b ) a single dmd mirror imaged with @xmath36 magnification and 780  nm illumination , the imaging wavelength for @xmath5rb , resulting in 960(80 )  nm fwhm ( @xmath37  nm ) .",
    "( c ) siemens star resolution target , as projected and reimaged with 532  nm light .",
    "( d ) siemens star imprinted on to the atomic density and averaged over 10 runs of the experiment .",
    "quantitative analysis of the resolution targets is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_mtf ] . ]    as the dmd mirrors have only two states  on and off  the resulting image is binary .",
    "however , given the limited spatial resolution of a typical optical system , the technique know as error - diffusion or halftoning can be used to produce intensity gradients  @xcite .",
    "we determine the resolution of our system by first turning on a single mirror of the dmd and projecting it on to the atom plane .",
    "the mirror pitch is 10.8  @xmath25 m , so the minification factor of 100 results in an imaged mirror width of 108  nm , below the theoretical resolution limit of the top microscope system ( 605  nm fwhm at 532  nm illumination ) .",
    "as the single mirror is not resolvable , its image at the atom plane approximates the point - spread function ( psf ) of the dmd imaging system .",
    "we reimage this focused spot on the camera with the bottom microscope system .",
    "accounting for the magnification factor of the reimaging system results in a 650(50 )  nm fwhm peak in the atom plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ psf_fig](a ) .",
    "this value is an upper limit , as it convolves any abberations of the reimaging system into the estimate of the spot size at the atom plane .",
    "back - propagating this resolution element to the dmd location gives a 65  @xmath25 m spot which spans a @xmath38 block of mirrors ; multiple mirrors will thus contribute to the resolution spot in the atom plane  @xcite .",
    "we therefore can use error - diffusion to control the light intensity at the atom plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dmd_patterns](b ) .",
    "the right half of fig .",
    "[ fig_imaging ] illustrates the bottom microscope imaging system . a second microscope objective ( olympus lcpln20xir ) similar to the projection objective with a 0.45 na and correction collar , but with near - infrared coatings , forms the first part of the imaging system .",
    "collimated light at 780  nm is produced through the top objective , resulting in an imaging beam 1.1  mm in diameter .",
    "we then incorporate a lens relay system to allow us to implement dark - field imaging in the future  @xcite .",
    "finally , an intermediate image is formed with @xmath39 magnification which is then reimaged to the ccd camera ( pixis 1024b ) with the adjustable vzm450 zoom lens ( @xmath40  @xmath41 ) .",
    "we therefore produce absorption images of the condensate in the final trap configurations with a total zoom of ( @xmath42  @xmath36 ) . by again turning on a single mirror of the dmd , but illuminating it at 780  nm",
    ", we can estimate the psf at this wavelength , as shown in fig .",
    "[ psf_fig](b ) .",
    "this results in a 960(80 )  nm fwhm peak , consistent with the measurement at 532  nm after accounting for the increased wavelength .",
    "the resulting high resolution dmd patterns produce a repulsive potential for the atoms trapped in the sheet - magnetic hybrid .",
    "we ramp on the intensity of the laser illuminating the dmd near the end of the final evaporation sequence in the sheet - hybrid trap to a value @xmath43 , where @xmath25 is the chemical potential of the bec in the final trapping potential . in the case of a 80  @xmath25 m  @xmath29  50",
    "@xmath25 m rectangular trapping geometry , the chemical potential calculated using the measured trap frequencies and 700,000 atoms is @xmath44 .",
    "subsequently , the sheet power is linearly increased over 500  ms to keep the atoms trapped vertically while the magnetic field is linearly ramped to zero , increasing the vertical trapping frequency to @xmath45  hz .",
    "the light power incident on the dmd can also be increased in this step .",
    "however , we have observed a decrease in the bec lifetime with increasing intensity , with measured time constants of ( 18.2 , 10.9 , 9.1 , 8.2 )  s for a 80  @xmath25 m  @xmath29  50  @xmath25 m rectangular dmd box potential with peaks of ( 1.2@xmath25 , 2.4@xmath25 , 4.8@xmath25 , 7.2@xmath25 ) respectively .",
    "similar intensity - dependent lifetimes were observed for different trap geometries . as the atoms are confined to areas of low dmd light intensity , we believe residual vibrational coupling in the dmd optical path results in parametric heating of the cloud .",
    "several high - resolution atom - trap configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dmd_patterns ] , emphasizing the wide range of possible patterns .",
    "these are imaged immediately after turning off the optical trap .",
    "alternatively , by imaging from the side after 27  ms time of flight ( tof ) expansion , we can determine atom number and bec fraction for the different distributions .",
    "we note that we have used the same evaporation ramp for each of these configurations  we expect that a near pure bec can be achieved for each with optimization .",
    "we generally observe lower condensate fractions for smaller enclosed areas for similar optical evaporation profiles .",

    "the binary dmd pattern was generated by applying a floyd - steinberg error diffusion algorithm  @xcite to an 8-bit grayscale image of a sinusoidal lattice . as we have not included a boundary to the lattice in the dmd pattern , we leave the magnetic field on and retain a @xmath46  hz radial trapping frequency , producing a more symmetrically filled lattice .",

    "for a more quantitative characterisation of the optical systems  @xcite , we produced a binary siemens star resolution target on the dmd , imaged the projected light pattern , and imaged becs loaded in to the pattern , as shown in fig .",
    "[ psf_fig](c , d ) .",
    "these patterns can then be analyzed to determine the modulation transfer function ( mtf ) of the total optical system .",
    "this is accomplished using the protocol illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_mtf ] .",
    "we first determine circular paths around the siemens star , with frequency spacings @xmath48 line - pairs ( lp)/@xmath25 m , for the ( light , atom ) siemens star .",
    "a contrast value is found for each of the 16 adjacent bright and dark spoke pairs , and the average contrast is calculated for each circular path . as the mtf is the fourier transform of the psf , which we estimate with a gaussian fit , we extract a fwhm from a gaussian fit of the measured mtf .",
    "these quantities are then related by @xmath49 , allowing us to compare the psf fwhm extracted from the mtf with that of the single mirror image .",
    "for the siemens star with 532  nm light , we find a mtf fwhm of @xmath50  lp/@xmath25 m , corresponding to a psf fwhm of 630(10 )  nm , in agreement with the 650(50 )  nm measurement of the single mirror image . when imaging a bec in the siemens star pattern , we find a mtf fwhm of @xmath51  lp/@xmath25 m , corresponding to a psf fwhm of 1250(20 )  nm , larger than the 960(80 )  nm single mirror image at 780  nm illumination .",

    "the dmd is capable of switching mirrors from dc to the specified maximum frequency of 20  khz , which we have verified through photodiode measurement .",
    "this wide modulation range , along with the ability to store 13,889 frames on the device , enables a high level of dynamic control . at low modulation frequencies",

    ", we performed a modulation for 500 cycles at fixed frequencies ranging from 100  hz to 16  khz .",

    "<S> programable spatial light modulators ( slms ) have significantly advanced the configurable optical trapping of particles . </S>",
    "<S> typically , these devices are utilized in the fourier plane of an optical system , but direct imaging of an amplitude pattern can potentially result in increased simplicity and computational speed . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate high - resolution direct imaging of a digital micromirror device ( dmd ) at high numerical apertures ( na ) , which we apply to the optical trapping of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> we utilise a ( @xmath0 ) pixel dmd and commercially available 0.45 na microscope objectives , finding that atoms confined in a hybrid optical / magnetic or all - optical potential can be patterned using repulsive blue - detuned ( 532  nm ) light with 630(10 )  nm full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) resolution , within 5% of the diffraction limit . </S>",
    "<S> the result is near arbitrary control of the density the bec without the need for expensive custom optics . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce the technique of time - averaged dmd potentials , demonstrating the ability to produce multiple grayscale levels with minimal heating of the atomic cloud , by utilising the high switching speed ( 20 khz maximum ) of the dmd . </S>",
    "<S> these techniques will enable the realization and control of diverse optical potentials for superfluid dynamics and atomtronics applications with quantum gases . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of this system in a direct imaging configuration has wider application for optical trapping at non - trivial nas . </S>"
