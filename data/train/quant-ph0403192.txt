    "one of the most challenging problems in quantum computation has been the design of quantum algorithms which outperform their classical counterparts in meaningful tasks .",

    "have been extremely well succeeded in certain tasks @xcite , the hope that the quantum random walk @xcite may provide a similar insight for quantum coding has generated a great interest in this model .",
    "however , the dynamical properties of the quantum random walk are rich enough so that this system is physically interesting in its own right @xcite . for instance , due to quantum coherence effects , the position distribution of the quantum random walker spreads out linearly in time .",
    "in contrast , the classical random walker spreads out only as the square root of time .",
    "several systems have been proposed as candidates to implement quantum random walks .",

    "decoherence in the quantum walk on the line has been considered recently by several authors .",
    "numerical simulations of the effect of different kinds of measurements have shown that the quantum walk properties are highly sensitive to decoherent events and in particular that the quadratic increase of the variance is eventually suppressed @xcite .",
    "other studies focused on the effect of measurements in chirality and reached similar conclusions @xcite . a different decoherent mechanism , unitary noise , also leads to a crossover from a quantum behavior at short times to a classical - like behavior at longer times @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walk with time is a direct consequence of the coherence of the quantum evolution @xcite .",
    "this can also be visualized through the separation of the evolution equation for a quantum system into a markovian term and a quantum interference term as proposed in @xcite . in this work , besides the study of the effect of measurements on the evolution of quantum random walkers , we also consider the decoherences generated by a different process , namely the influence of randomly broken links on the dynamics of the quantum walk .",
    "these mechanisms may be relevant in experimental realizations of quantum computers based on ising spin1/2 chains in solid - state substrates @xcite .",
