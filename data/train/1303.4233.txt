    "cosmological phase transitions may have observable consequences .",
    "in particular , first - order phase transitions provide a departure from thermal equilibrium , which may give rise to a variety of cosmological relics , such as the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , cosmic magnetic fields @xcite , topological defects @xcite , baryon inhomogeneities @xcite , and gravitational waves @xcite . in a first - order phase transition , bubbles of the stable phase nucleate and grow inside the supercooled phase .",
    "the velocity of the phase transition fronts ( bubble walls ) is an important parameter for the generation of cosmological relics .",
    "for instance , generating sizeable gravitational waves requires high velocities , whereas the generation of baryon number in the electroweak phase transition peaks at small velocities .",
    "the wall velocity is governed in principle by the pressure difference between the two phases .",
    "however , the wall propagation disturbs the plasma , and the latter resists the motion of the wall .",
    "this opposition manifests itself in two ways .",
    "microscopically , the interactions of non - equilibrium plasma particles with the wall cause a friction force on the latter @xcite . besides , the latent heat that is released at the phase transition fronts causes temperature variations in the plasma @xcite , which tend to diminish the pressure difference between phases .",
    "these two mechanisms are called microphysics and hydrodynamics , respectively .",
    "microphysics is a very difficult subject and for several years was considered only in the non - relativistic ( nr ) limit . as a consequence , phenomenological models have been used in order to extrapolate the friction force to higher velocities .",
    "the general approach is based on adding a covariant damping term @xmath0 to the field equation , where @xmath1 is the four - velocity of the plasma ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this gives a friction force of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wall velocity and @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 can be determined by considering the limit @xmath6 and comparing with microphysics calculations .",
    "recently , the opposite limit was considered @xcite .",
    "the total force acting on the electroweak bubble wall was derived for an ultra - relativistic ( ur ) wall propagating with extremely large values of the gamma factor .",
    "for such a fast moving wall the physics is quite simpler than in the nr case , since the plasma is almost unaffected by the passage of the wall .",
    "the resulting total force does not depend on the wall velocity . as a consequence ,",
    "if the force is positive , then the wall runs away ( i.e. , as the wall propagates , @xmath7 grows linearly with the propagation distance ) .",
    "if the total force turns out to be negative , then the initial assumption of an extremely ultra - relativistic wall is incorrect and the wall must reach a slower , stationary state .",
    "thus , we have a simple criterion for the existence of runaway solutions .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite motivated modifications to the usual phenomenological models for the friction , so that the friction saturates for large @xmath7 @xcite",
    ". the modifications essentially amount to eliminating the gamma factor from the friction force , so that @xmath8 .",
    "we wish to point out that the runaway condition found in ref .",
    "@xcite is only a necessary condition for the existence of the runaway solution .",
    "it does not guarantee that the runaway solution will actually be realized .",
    "indeed , it is well known that different propagation modes can exist for the same set of parameters ( due to nonlinear hydrodynamics ) . in particular , the runaway solution may coexist with a detonation solution .",
    "since detonations are presumably stable , the wall probably will not run away whenever it can propagate as a detonation .",
    "we also notice that a single - parameter phenomenological model of the form @xmath9 will hardly give the correct values of the friction force in both ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic limits .",
    "the main goals of this paper are the following . in the first place , we wish to identify the friction force in the ur limit , in order to treat very fast but stationary solutions .",
    "this can be done by decomposing the total force obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite into a driving force and a friction force . in principle , though , it is not clear which is the correct decomposition , since there is no velocity - dependent term in this force . besides , hydrodynamics is different in the stationary and runaway regimes .",
    "we wish to consider the existence of stationary and runaway solutions and discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for the wall to run away .",
    "secondly , we wish to construct a well - motivated phenomenological model , which interpolates between the nr and ur limits .",
    "the model will have two free parameters and will allow us to treat stationary solutions with intermediate velocities .",
    "we also wish to discuss the case of phase transitions with a large amount of supercooling , which favor fast - moving phase transition fronts .",
    "the plan is the following . in section [ hydro ]",
    "we briefly review the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions and the hydrodynamic solutions for stationary fronts . in section [ micro ]",
    "we discuss the friction forces .",
    "we introduce an ultra - relativistic friction parameter and we discuss the conditions for the wall to run away . in section [ runaway ]",
    "we discuss a phenomenological model for the friction . in section [ result ]",
    "we consider the bag equation of state to obtain analytical formulas for the wall velocity and for the runaway conditions .",
    "we also analyze the general dependence of the bubble wall velocity on the friction and thermodynamic parameters .",
    "finally , in section [ strong ] we discuss the case of strong supercooling .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ conclu ] .",
    "a cosmological phase transition is described in general by a scalar field @xmath10 which acts as an order parameter .",

    "the latter is given by @xcite @xmath14 where the sum runs over particle species , @xmath15 is the number of degrees of freedom of species @xmath16 , the upper sign stands for bosons , the lower sign stands for fermions , and @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 are the field - dependent masses .",
    "there is also a correction from the resummed daisy diagrams for bosons . for our discussions",
    "it is not necessary to consider the exact form of this correction .",
    "its effect is to modify the cubic term in the expansion of @xmath19 in powers of @xmath20 , as we shall comment below .    in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the field lies at a minimum of the free energy .",
    "if there are several minima , then different phases are possible for the system , and phase transitions may occur . in the simplest case we have a high - temperature minimum @xmath21 ( in general , @xmath22 ) and a low - temperature one @xmath23 .",
    "for a first - order phase transition , these two minima coexist in a certain range of temperatures , separated by a barrier .",
    "all the properties of a given phase are derived from @xmath24 , once it is evaluated at a minimum .",
    "thus , the two phases are characterized by the free energy densities @xmath25 which give different equations of state ( eos ) .",
    "the energy density is given by @xmath26 , where a prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",

    "the phases are in equilibrium at the critical temperature @xmath32 , defined by @xmath33 .",
    "the energy density difference at @xmath34 is called the latent heat @xmath35 .",
    "the phase transition occurs , in principle , when the universe reaches the critical temperature .",
    "however , the nucleation rate vanishes at @xmath34 . bubbles of the stable phase effectively begin to nucleate at a temperature @xmath36 below @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the nucleated bubbles expand due to the pressure difference between the two phases ( at @xmath37 ) .",
    "the phase transition fronts move with a velocity @xmath3 which depends on the pressure difference and the friction with the surrounding plasma .",
    "the release of latent heat causes local reheating and bulk motions of the plasma .",
    "considering the development of a phase transition involves solving a set of coupled equations for several quantities , each of which is not easy to compute , such as the nucleation rate , the wall velocity , and the temperature .",
    "the latter varies due to the expansion of the universe and the release of energy at the phase transition ( for the dynamics of phase transitions see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we shall concentrate on the motion of phase transition fronts for a given nucleation temperature @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the relevant variables are the scalar field @xmath38 , the temperature @xmath39 , and the velocity @xmath40 of the plasma",
    ". we shall consider the thin - wall approximation for the field profile .",
    "thus , we shall assume that the field varies in an infinitely thin region , outside which @xmath10 is a constant .",
    "for the macroscopic treatment this is a good approximation , since the wall width is much smaller than the width of the fluid profiles @xcite .",
    "we shall consider planar - symmetry fronts moving in the @xmath41 direction ( see @xcite for a discussion on considering different wall geometries ) . as a consequence of the friction with the plasma , the bubble wall often reaches a terminal velocity in a very short time after bubble nucleation . in the rest of this section",
    "we shall review the hydrodynamics for stationary phase transition fronts .",
    "the equations for the fluid variables can be obtained from the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath42 . for stationary profiles moving at constant velocity , it is useful to consider the rest frame of the front .",
    "the relation between the fluid variables on each side of the wall is well known @xcite , @xmath43where @xmath44 , and we have used a @xmath45 sign for variables in front of the wall and a @xmath46 sign for variables behind the wall ( which correspond to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 phases , respectively ) . for an infinitely thin interface , eqs .",
    "( [ disc1]-[disc2 ] ) determine the discontinuity of the fluid profiles at the phase transition front .",
    "there can also be discontinuities in the fluid profiles away from the bubble wall .",

    "shock fronts_. in such surfaces , the temperature and fluid velocity are discontinuous but the eos is the same on both sides . in the reference frame of shock fronts",
    "( [ disc1]-[disc2 ] ) still apply .    since there is no characteristic distance scale in the fluid equations , it is usual to assume the _ similarity condition _ @xcite , namely , that @xmath47 and @xmath48 depend only on @xmath49 . in the planar - symmetry case we have either constant solutions @xmath50 , or a `` rarefaction wave '' solution @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the speed of sound ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent discussions ) .",

    "e.g. , @xcite ) . for detonations",
    "the incoming flow is faster than the outgoing flow ( @xmath55 ) and is supersonic ( @xmath56 ) for any value of @xmath57 in the range @xmath58 . for deflagrations",
    ", we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 . at @xmath61 ,",
    "the value of @xmath62 is a minimum for detonations and a maximum for deflagrations . at this point",
    "the hydrodynamic process is called a _ jouguet _ detonation or deflagration .",
    "we denote the corresponding values by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the hydrodynamic process is called _ weak _ if the velocities @xmath53 and @xmath54 are either both supersonic or both subsonic .",
    "otherwise , the hydrodynamic process is called _",
    "strong_.    the fluid temperature and velocity profiles depend on the boundary conditions far behind the wall ( at the center of the bubble ) and far in front of the wall , where information on the bubble has not arrived yet .",
    "thus , the fluid velocity vanishes far behind and far in front of the wall .",
    "furthermore , the temperature far in front of the wall is given by the temperature @xmath65 at which the bubble nucleated .",
    "three kinds of solutions are compatible with these requirements : a weak detonation , for which the wall is supersonic , a jouguet deflagration , which is also supersonic , and a weak deflagration , which is subsonic .",
    "the relevant properties of these solutions are the following ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) .",
    "for the supersonic detonation , the fluid in front of the wall is unperturbed and we have @xmath66 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath67 .",
    "the fluid profile behind the wall is given by the rarefaction wave .",
    "the strong detonation solution must be discarded because it is not possible to construct a fluid profile for it .",
    "for the deflagration , the fluid velocity in front of the wall is not at rest , and there is a supersonic shock front preceding the wall . beyond the shock , the fluid is still unperturbed at temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the solution between the phase - transition and shock fronts is a constant .",
    "the boundary condition for deflagrations is often considered to be that the fluid behind the wall is at rest . in this case , we have @xmath68 .",
    "this `` traditional '' deflagration can be either weak ( and subsonic ) , or strong ( and supersonic ) .",
    "the limit between these solutions is a jouguet deflagration with @xmath69 .",
    "it has been argued that strong deflagrations are unstable and should not be considered @xcite .",
    "however , supersonic deflagrations that are not strong can exist @xcite if we relax the boundary condition that the fluid is at rest behind the wall . thus ,",
    "if the condition @xmath70 is replaced by @xmath71 , we have a jouguet deflagration with @xmath72 . in this case",
    "the wall is followed by a rarefaction wave .",
    "since the wall moves at the speed of sound with respect to the fluid behind it , and the fluid also moves with respect to the center of the bubble , the wall velocity is supersonic .",

    "<S> in cosmological first - order phase transitions , the microscopic interaction of the phase transition fronts with non - equilibrium plasma particles manifests itself macroscopically as friction forces . in general </S>",
    "<S> , it is a nontrivial problem to compute these forces , and only two limits have been studied , namely , that of very slow walls and , more recently , ultra - relativistic walls which run away . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider ultra - relativistic velocities and show that stationary solutions still exist when the parameters allow the existence of runaway walls . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for the fronts to actually run away . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a phenomenological model for the friction , which interpolates between the non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic values . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the friction depends on two friction coefficients which can be calculated for specific models . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the velocity of phase transition fronts as a function of the friction parameters , the thermodynamic parameters , and the amount of supercooling . </S>"
