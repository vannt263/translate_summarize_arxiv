    "thin liquid films have been intensively studied over the last decades .",
    "many contributions have been devoted to them , owing to their technological importance and wide industrial applications .",
    "their rich interfacial behaviors originate from combinations of various effects such as capillarity , intermolecular forces , thermocapillarity and gravity .",
    "one important effect among them is evaporation or condensation .",
    "it was often incorporated in the studies of thin films , @xcite and dewetting patterns resulting from drying of films were analyzed .",
    "@xcite    many past studies on evaporating or condensing liquid films have ignored the dynamics of the gas above the liquid film , assuming the infinitely deep gas phase .",
    "@xcite however , in this study we consider a situation where the gas phase is bounded by rigid parallel wall from above and has a finite depth comparable with the liquid one .",
    "the full linear stability analyses of this system were performed in several papers.@xcite despite the apparent simplicity of the configuration , this system includes a free surface and interfacial boundary conditions involving phase change , and therefore is very sophisticated . in order to simplify this problem , we apply long - wave approximation to both layers .",
    "the advantage of the use of long - wave or lubrication approximation is the reduction of dimensionality : a one - dimensional ( two - dimensional ) film evolution equation can be derived in a two - dimensional ( three - dimensional ) system .",
    "normally , only the dynamics of the liquid is considered , leading to a one - sided model . however",
    ", if the ambient gas layer is thin enough , a two - layer model would better describe the system .",
    "this was demonstrated by vanhook et al.,@xcite who developed a two - layer theory to reproduce their experimental results .",
    "they showed that their two - layer model better predicts the onset of instability in their experiment than the corresponding one - layer model and also correctly describes the formation of localized elevations . in their approach ,",
    "only the heat conduction in the gas phase is taken into account , and the gas dynamics is ignored because the viscosity of the gas is much less than that of the liquid .",
    "later , merkt et al.@xcite presented an evolution equation of the interface of two viscous fluid layers in the same geometry .",
    "their model allows for the shear stress induced by the motion of the upper layer and therefore is reduced to the single layer equation in the limit of small viscosity of the upper layer .",
    "although their goal is the observation of pattern formation in the long - time regime , the two - layer models have been applied to the cases of rayleigh - taylor instability@xcite and ultrathin films.@xcite    nevertheless , in the two - layer systems mentioned above there is no phase transformation at the interface . here , we construct a two - layer theory for liquid - vapor layers which undergo phase change , using long - wave approximation . note that the application of long - wave theory to the vapor phase was made in the study of film boiling.@xcite",
    "if we take into account the effect of the mass flux across the interface , an instability peculiar to this system is expected , even for the presence of large disparity in viscosity and density between liquid and vapor ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "the liquid film is initially in equilibrium with its vapor layer .",
    "if the liquid side is heated or the vapor side is cooled , evaporation occurs at a hotter portion of the interface and condensation at a colder one .",
    "since the vapor layer is bounded , the vapor pressure becomes higher in the evaporating region and lower in the condensing one .",
    "according to this lateral vapor pressure gradient , the higher vapor pressure pushes the interface downward and the lower one pulls it upward .",
    "then , the surface deflection is amplified .",
    "to our knowledge , this pressure - induced instability mechanism has not been considered in the past , because the uniform ambient vapor pressure has been assumed in previous studies of evaporating or condensing liquid films .",
    "@xcite        to derive the model , we require the interfacial boundary conditions such that the mass transfer occurs between the phases .",
    "we follow those of the earlier studies on evaporating or condensing liquid films@xcite except the thermodynamic relation at the interface .",
    "they used the linearized equation where the mass flux through the interface is proportional to the difference between the interfacial temperature and its saturation value corresponding to the surrounding vapor pressure , based on kinetic theory.@xcite this relation can not be directly applied to the present problem , because the local saturation temperature varies in the lateral direction , depending on the vapor pressure .",
    "hence , we must modify the relation to take this effect into account .",
    "fortunately , this can be easily done in the thermodynamic framework .",
    "for instance , ajaev and homsy@xcite and wayner@xcite used a nonequilibrium thermodynamic relation including the saturation temperature variation due to capillarity and disjoining pressure .",
    "this effect was later included in the model of evaporating or condensing thin liquid films.@xcite however , they assumed the vapor pressure to be constant . in our two - layer model ,",
    "this relation should be extended in accordance with the vapor pressure variation .",
    "thus , one of the purposes of this work is to investigate the effect of the vapor pressure dependence of the local saturation temperature .",
    "note that this effect was not considered in the film boiling case,@xcite although the lateral vapor pressure variation , which drives the motion of the vapor , certainly exists in the boiling film .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that a somewhat similar motivation to ours is found in ref .  , where the vapor concentration in the ambient gas phase above the liquid film fluctuates and thereby the mass flux varies along the interface .",
    "however , they neglect the bulk gas dynamics itself and consider only the diffusion of the vapor .    here",
    ", we start with a more general nonequilibrium thermodynamic law , which reduces to , in the linear domain , a proportional connection between the interfacial mass flux and the difference of chemical potential in each phase.@xcite from this law , we can naturally derive a thermodynamic relation similar to that of ajaev and homsy and wayner .",
    "moreover , the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium , adopted in some papers on two - phase problem,@xcite is recovered by taking the appropriate limit of the derived relation .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic relation used here is also the extension of the interfacial equilibrium condition into nonequilibrium states .",
    "we note that more general formulation taking into account the nonequilibrium effect contains a temperature discontinuity at the liquid - vapor interface during evaporation or condensation , as was done in ref .  .",
    "however , this temperature jump may be neglected unless the phase change occurs too rapidly.@xcite    in the derivation of our model , we manipulate the mass flux balance equation at the liquid - vapor interface . in the literature , the effect of mass loss or gain at the liquid surface due to evaporation or condensation has been included into the model through this equation by assuming that the vapor speed is much larger than the liquid one because the vapor density is much smaller than the liquid one .",
    "@xcite however , in this paper we show another interpretation of this equation as a consequence of order estimate .",
    "if we assume that the degree of the disparity in density between two phases is much greater than that in viscosity , which is valid for most substances far from the critical point , we can find that the liquid velocity is not balanced by the vapor one in the mass balance equation . instead , it is balanced by the interface velocity , which indicates that the effect of mass loss or gain can be neglected .",
    "this order estimate leads to the approximation of the mass balance equation , where the total mass of the liquid is conserved and the effect of the mass flux affects only the dynamics of the vapor . under this approximation , we derive the model where the conservation of the total liquid mass is guaranteed , whereas the effect of evaporation or condensation remains in the vapor dynamics .",

    "<S> we find the stability criterion , which suggests that only slight temperature gradients are sufficient to overcome the gravitational effect for a water / vapor system . the same holds for the rayleigh - taylor unstable case , with a possibility that the vapor pressure effect may be weakened if the accommodation coefficient is below a certain critical value . </S>"
