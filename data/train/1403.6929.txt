    "quantum entanglement @xcite has been used as an efficient resource for several quantum communication protocols such as teleportation , dense coding , and cryptography @xcite .",
    "the existence of long range quantum correlations between entangled qubits allows the use of such systems for information transfer in communication protocols . in general ,",
    "if a state is maximally entangled then the optimal success of a communication protocol is a certainty .",
    "however , in real experimental set - ups it is difficult to prepare a pure maximally entangled state due to the difficulty in handling the multi - particle quantum systems in terms of interaction with environment , control , and preserving the necessary quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "this leads to a situation where one may have to deal with mixed entangled resources for quantum information processing .",
    "this raises the question of usefulness of such mixed entangled systems for efficient quantum information processing .",
    "verstraete and verschelde @xcite have shown that any entangled two - qubit mixed state can be used as a resource for quantum teleportation using certain trace preserving local operations and classical communications .",
    "the measure of usefulness of any two - qubit mixed entangled resource @xmath0 for quantum teleportation is given by teleportation fidelity , i.e. @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the singlet fraction of the entangled resource defined as @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath5 , quantum teleportation is always successful and if the singlet fraction of the underlying state is unity then in principle perfect teleportation can be achieved .",
    "hence for a state to be useful as a resource , the singlet fraction or the teleportation fidelity must be maximized . in this letter , we address the following question : given an entangled mixed state of two qubits as a resource for quantum teleportation , what is the upper bound on singlet fraction that can be achieved using all possible filtering operations ?",
    "our results show an interesting observation that the maximal singlet fraction obtained in @xcite can still be increased to coincide with the required upper bound on singlet fraction .",
    "we analyze the upper bound on the singlet fraction ( and thus the upper bound on teleportation fidelity ) that can be achieved using a two qubit entangled mixed state .",
    "we call this bound as dembo s bound on singlet fraction for any given two - qubit mixed state .",
    "although verstraete _ et al _ have found that any two - qubit mixed entangled state can be used to achieve @xmath5 using optimal local operations and classical communication , our analysis in this letter demonstrates that the singlet fraction or teleportation fidelity obtained in @xcite does not achieve the dembo s upper bound on singlet fraction .",
    "we further demonstrate that one can in fact obtain the optimal singlet fraction in coherence with the dembo s bound by applying additional filtering operations .",
    "in general , our results show that for any state with @xmath6 , the dembo s bound on singlet fraction can be successfully achieved .",
    "the increase in singlet fraction using local operations and hence the increase in teleportation fidelity will have a significant impact on quantum information processing . in principle , this will allow one to use even a mixed state to achieve successful teleportation with optimal fidelity @xcite . furthermore , our results may also release the constraints on the experimental set - ups to prepare a pure maximally entangled state for efficient and optimal quantum teleportation .",
    "verstraete _ et al _ have addressed the problem of maximal achievable singlet fraction of entangled two - qubit mixed states optimized over all trace preserving local operations and classical communications .",
    "our study is motivated by the fact that the optimal singlet fraction @xmath7 of the filtered state obtained in @xcite does not exceed the value of @xmath8 . at this juncture",
    ", we would like to raise the question of analyzing the upper bound on the singlet fraction of the filtered state .",
    "precisely , we are interested in analyzing whether the value @xmath9 can be increased to coincide with the upper bound on singlet fraction . in order to discuss the importance of our results , we now proceed to establish a relation between the upper bound on the singlet fraction and eigen values of any hermitian - positive semidefinite density operator .    in quantum information processing , eigenvalues play an important role not only in shedding light on many physical aspects of quantum systems but also for analyzing many essential features such as entanglement , discord , communication , and security . for higher dimensional systems , evaluating the exact maximum or minimum eigenvalue of a hermitian positive - definite matrix",
    "is not easy , but its upper or lower bound suffices . to proceed further with our analysis we state the following theorem @xcite : for any real @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 and a positive semidefinite operator @xmath12 , the following inequality holds @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the transpose of matrix @xmath11 , @xmath16 is the @xmath17 eigen value of the matrix @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . + for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , eq . ( 1 ) can be re - expressed as @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\le & \\lambda _ 4 \\left ( { \\frac{i_{4}}{2 } - x^{\\gamma } } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is partial transpose of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 represents the filter .",
    "although the functional form of the upper bound of @xmath9 is optimal for the above inequality , it depends on the state parameter and hence , must have a maximum achievable value for every particular value of the state parameter .",
    "this value would be provided by dembo s bound @xcite stated below as : + for any @xmath10 hermitian positive semi - definite operator @xmath28 with eigen values @xmath29 , dembo s bound can be given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the lower bound on the minimal eigenvalue of @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the upper bound on the maximal eigen value of @xmath33 , and @xmath35 is an eigenvector of dimension @xmath36 .",
    "using dembo s bound eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be re - expressed as @xmath37 therefore , the upper bound on optimal singlet fraction is @xmath38 for the family of states given by @xmath39 the upper bound on singlet fraction @xmath40 is @xmath41 = \\frac{2-f}{4(1-f ) } ; { \\rm {     } } \\frac{1}{3 } \\le f \\le \\frac{2}{3 } \\\\   f^*_{d } [ \\rho ( f ) ] = f;{\\rm {     } } f \\ge \\frac{2}{3 } , \\\\ \\end{array}{1}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath40 obtained in eq . ( 7 )",
    "is the optimal value of singlet fraction that can be achieved for the family of states represented by eq .",
    "verstraete and verschelde have shown that using trace preserving optimal local operations , the maximal achievable singlet fraction @xmath9 for the family of states given in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is @xmath42 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ { 1 + \\frac{{f^2 } } { { 4(1 - f ) } } } \\right];{\\rm {     } } \\frac{1}{3 } \\le f \\le \\frac{2}{3 } \\\\   f^ { * } [ \\rho ( f ) ] = f;{\\rm {     } } f \\ge \\frac{2}{3 } , \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) describe an interesting result that @xmath9 does not achieve the upper bound on singlet fraction given by @xmath40 .",
    "a comparison of maximal singlet fraction @xmath43 obtained after performing the filtering operations and @xmath40 obtained using dembo s bound is given in fig .",
    "( 1 ) and clearly demonstrates that the optimal singlet fraction @xmath43 is always less than the optimal singlet fraction @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "in general , we will always find that @xmath46 .",
    "dembo s upper bound on singlet fraction is obtained using mathematical rigour .",
    "however , we still need to find a way to obtained this bound experimentally i.e. would it be possible to increase the value of optimal singlet fraction performing local operations and classical communication on the filtered state i.e. can we achieve the upper bound of singlet fraction given by dembo s bound ? surprisingly ,",
    "our results show that the bound is indeed achievable .    in order to enhance the value of optimal singlet fraction @xmath43",
    ", we perform another filtering operation on the filtered state such that the singlet fraction of the output state can be given as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the success probability multiplied with the optimal singlet fraction of the state coming out of the second filter .",
    "if we define @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the success probability of first filter ( for details , please refer to @xcite ) , then for @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 can be re - expressed as @xmath55\\ ] ] the definition of @xmath51 suggests that for success probability @xmath49 to be high , @xmath51 must be minimized .",
    "moreover , the minimum value of @xmath51 should be chosen in such a way that the value of singlet fraction for the second filter must not exceed dembo s bound .",
    "hence , the minimum value of @xmath51 would be @xmath56}{f^{*}(\\rho_{f})}\\ ] ] using eq . (",
    "10 ) and ( 11 ) , we have @xmath57 eq .",
    "( 12 ) clearly shows that one can achieve the maximum singlet fraction equals to dembo s bound by using the filtering operations twice .    as an illustration",
    ", we use the family of states given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) to calculate the @xmath54 . in this case , eq . ( 11 ) will become @xmath58 and hence @xmath59 which is equal to @xmath40 .",
    "+ hence , applying the filter twice will always result in achieving the upper bound on singlet fraction for any two - qubit mixed density operator .",
    "however , achieving this upper bound on singlet fraction will lead to the decrease in success probability of the first filter .",
    "nevertheless , the second filter always compensates for the decrease in success probability of the first filter by attaining the dembo s bound on singlet fraction .    in summary",
    ", we have established a relation between dembo s upper bound and singlet fraction ( and hence with teleportation fidelity ) of a mixed two - qubit entangled state .",
    "this relation is used to demonstrate that any two - qubit mixed entangled state can be used as a resource to achieve maximum possible teleportation fidelity .",
    "it was found earlier that the the trace preserving local operations always yield a teleportation fidelity larger than @xmath8 if the original state is entangled .",
    "however , we found that the maximal fidelity obtained earlier can be increased with additional local operations with certain non - zero probability",
    ". it would be interesting to find an example where the optimal fidelity after the operation of a single filter can coincide with dembo s bound .",
