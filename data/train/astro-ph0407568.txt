    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) exhibit a wide range of morphologies .",
    "while the overall shape of a pn may be round , elliptical , or bipolar , most are limb - brightened , indicating a lower density in the interior , or the existence of a central cavity .",
    "it has been suggested that pne are formed by dynamical interactions between the current fast stellar wind and previous slow wind @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations of interacting - stellar - wind models have indeed been successful in reproducing the hollow - shell structure and overall shapes of pne by varying the pole - to - equator density gradient in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) progenitor s slow wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a shortcoming of the hydrodynamic modeling is that often several sets of parameters based on differing geometries are capable of reproducing the same morphology .",
    "observations of spatially resolved kinematics of a pn can help differentiate among models .",
    "we have been studying the physical structure of pne using both imaging and high - dispersion spectroscopic observations , in order to understand their formation and evolution .",
    "thus far , we have analyzed the owl nebula ( ngc3587 ) in paper i @xcite and ngc7662 in paper ii @xcite .",
    "the owl nebula is a triple - shell pn ; its `` owl face '' morphology is caused by bipolar cavities excavated by a fast wind that ceased some time ago , and its kinematics indicate that the nebular material is backfilling these cavities .",
    "ngc7662 is also a triple - shell pn ; its bright main nebula consists of two elliptical shells with simple structures in h@xmath0 and [ ] , although the outer rim of the main nebula is interspersed with [ ] -bright knots .",
    "these two pne were chosen for our study because their morphologies have been successfully reproduced by interacting - stellar - wind models .    there exist pne that do not possess morphological features to suggest the presence of wind - wind interactions .",
    "ngc1360 is such a pn .",
    "its surface brightness does not dip deeply at the center or rise steeply at the limb to indicate a hollow shell structure .",
    "the lack of shell morphology in ngc1360 makes it particularly interesting .",
    "therefore , we have chosen this pn for a spatio - kinematic analysis in order to determine its physical structure and to investigate its evolutionary status .",
    "this paper reports our observations and analysis of ngc1360 .",
    "narrow - band h@xmath0 images of ngc1360 were obtained on 1999 october 89 with the 1  m telescope at mount laguna observatory ( mlo ) .",
    "the central wavelength and fwhm of the h@xmath0 filter are 6563    and 17  , respectively .",
    "the detector was a loral 2k ccd with a pixel size of 15 @xmath4 m , corresponding to an image scale of @xmath5 pixel@xmath6 and providing a field of view of 133@xmath7133 .",
    "the angular resolution was @xmath8 , as determined from the fwhm of field stars in the images .",
    "a total of 10 images , each with an exposure time of 600 s , were combined to form the final image .",
    "this image is shown in figure  1 .",
    "we have also retrieved archival _ hubble space telescope _ images of ngc1360 taken with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the f656n ( h@xmath0 ) and f658n ( [ ] ) filters .",
    "these observations were obtained on 1994 february 15 , during the  pre - cooldown \" period when the wfpc2 was operating at a temperature of @xmath977  c ( rather than the optimal @xmath988  c at which it normally operates ) .",
    "this higher operating temperature produced a substantially greater number of warm pixels and a higher dark current .",
    "to process the observations we first flagged and interpolated the warm pixels using the hot pixel lists available at stscihotpix.html ] , and then proceeded with the standard routines in the stsdas package within iraf .",
    "these images are not shown in this paper because the f658n image did not detect any nebulosity and the f656n image does not show any small - scale features unresolved in our ground - based h@xmath0 image in figure 1 .",
    "the f656n image has only been used to flux - calibrate our ground - based h@xmath0 image .",
    "the total h@xmath0 flux from ngc1360 is @xmath13.1@xmath10 ergs @xmath11 s@xmath6 .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopic observations of ngc1360 were made using the echelle spectrograph on the 4  m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) on 2001 december 25 .",
    "the 79 line  mm@xmath6 echelle grating and the long - focus red camera were used to achieve a reciprocal dispersion of 3.4   mm@xmath6 .",
    "the spectrograph was used in the single - order , long - slit mode to allow the coverage of the h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] @xmath126548,6584 lines along a slit length of @xmath13@xmath13 .",
    "the data were recorded with the site 2k no .  6 ccd with a pixel size of 24 @xmath4 m , which corresponds to @xmath14 pixel@xmath6 along the spatial direction and 3.7 km  s@xmath6  pixel@xmath6 along the dispersion direction .",
    "the slit width was @xmath15 , and the resultant instrumental fwhm was 12  at the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the echelle observations were made along the major axis of ngc1360 at the position angle ( pa ) of 27 .",
    "three slit positions were used to cover the full extent of the major axis , as marked in figure  1 .",
    "the integration time at each slit position was 600 s. the angular resolution , determined by the seeing , was @xmath16 .",
    "a mosaic of the h@xmath0 echellograms is shown in figure  2 , alongside an h@xmath0 image oriented such that the major axis is parallel to the spatial direction of the echellogram .",
    "as shown in the h@xmath0 image ( fig .  1 ) , ngc1360 appears elliptical with its major axis oriented along pa @xmath1 30@xmath17 .",
    "it lacks a sharp outer boundary because the surface brightness declines with distance until it drops below the background noise . in order to estimate the size of ngc1360",
    ", we determined the background noise in the h@xmath0 image and defined the nebular edge to be at 3@xmath18 above the background . using the threshold of 3@xmath19 ergs  @xmath11  s@xmath6  arcsec@xmath20",
    ", ngc1360 extends @xmath21 , as shown by the contour in figure  1 . at a distance of 350@xmath22 pc",
    "as determined from the _ hipparcos _ measurements @xcite , the linear size of ngc1360 would be @xmath23 pc .    while the overall surface brightness distribution of ngc1360 falls off radially , there are depressions of @xmath120% within 30@xmath24 of the central star and in the eastern hemisphere",
    ". the spatial distribution of these surface brightness depressions do not appear to be random .",
    "the central depression extends into the eastern hemisphere and curves southward , while another distinct depression curves from the east to the north of the region surrounding the central star .",
    "the cause of these depressions is either lower gas densities or a higher extinction .",
    "if the latter is true , the non - random distribution of the depressions suggests that the obscuring material is internal to the nebula .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the surface brightness of ngc1360 is presented in  4 .    at the northern end of the major axis there",
    "exist several nebular knots extending from 240@xmath24 out to 350@xmath24 from the central star .",
    "near the southern end of the major axis , there are also knots ( marked by an arrow in fig .  1 ) , but they are fainter and detected at just the 3@xmath18 level . the faint southern knots , the central star , and the bright northern knots are not aligned along a straight line ; instead , they form a slightly curved arc with the star at the apex . such a configuration has been observed in other pne and suggested nebular motion through the interstellar medium .",
    "the echelle observations at the three consecutive slit positions have been mosaicked into an echellogram spanning the full major axis of ngc1360 and are presented in figure 2 .",
    "this h@xmath0 echellogram shows a position - velocity ellipse , indicating an expanding shell in the nebula .",
    "furthermore , the position - velocity ellipse is tilted , with the southwestern and northeastern tips blue- and red - shifted , respectively . for an expanding ellipsoidal shell , the tilt of the position - velocity ellipse results from the inclination of the shell s polar axis with respect to the sky plane . as the position - velocity tilt occurs along the major axis of ngc1360 , its ellipsoidal shell must be prolate in shape , with its southwestern tip oriented toward us and its northeastern tip away from us .",
    "the velocity profile of the h@xmath0 line near the central star shows two broad components ( see fig .",
    "the approaching component has a heliocentric velocity of @xmath25 = 25 km  s@xmath6 and a width of fwhm = 30 km  s@xmath6 , while the receding component has @xmath25 = 73 km  s@xmath6 and fwhm = 37 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "these widths are much larger than the thermal width of the h@xmath0 line at 10@xmath26 k , fwhm = 21.4 km  s@xmath6 , indicating the existence of significant velocity variations along the line of sight within the nebular shell .",
    "the average velocity of the approaching and receding sides of the nebula , @xmath25 = 49 km  s@xmath6 , is adopted as the systemic velocity of ngc1360 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the previous measurement of @xmath25 = + 49.1 km  s@xmath6 by @xcite using a fabry - perot scanner for a 60@xmath24 aperture near the center of ngc1360 .",
    "the line - splitting at the center of a pn is usually adopted as twice its expansion velocity so that the apparent expansion velocity of ngc1360 would be 24 km  s@xmath6 ; however , as we discuss in  4.1 , this is an oversimplification of the expansion of ngc1360 .    in the h@xmath0 line , both the nebula and the knots are detected ; however , in the [ ] line , only the knots are detected .",
    "this is illustrated by the h@xmath0 and [ ] lines of the northeastern end of ngc1360 s major axis shown in figure  4 .",
    "the low [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio of the nebula is expected because the central star of ngc1360 has an effective temperature of 110,000 k @xcite and the ionization stage of n in the nebula is higher than n@xmath27",
    ". the high [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios of the knots suggest that they may be fliers , i.e. , fast , low - ionization emission regions @xcite .",
    "figure  4 shows that the innermost knots detected within the slit are at @xmath1260@xmath24 from the central star and have a radial velocity of @xmath28100 km  s@xmath6 corresponding to a systemic velocity of @xmath1 + 50 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the radial velocity of the knots increases outward by 0.5 km  s@xmath6 arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "these knots clearly move faster than the shell expansion , confirming their identification as fliers .",
    "the h@xmath0 image and echelle spectra of ngc1360 can be used to construct spatio - kinematic models .",
    "in contrast to the identifiable thin shells in the owl nebula ( paper i ) and ngc7662 ( paper ii ) that can be modeled easily , the shell of ngc1360 has both large velocity widths and irregular brightness variations in the echelle line image , which require simplifying assumptions to make the modeling tractable .",
    "we have assumed that ngc1360 consists of a series of concentric thin ellipsoidal shells and the shell expansion velocity increases outwards .",
    "consequently , the envelope of the position - velocity ellipse ( marked in fig .",
    "2a ) corresponds to an outer thin ellipsoidal shell that may be identified with the elliptical isophotes with a matching spatial extent in the direct image ( marked in fig .",
    "this outer thin shell can then be modeled using the methodology outlined by @xcite , by assuming that the shell expands homologously ( i.e. , a hubble law ) .",
    "we model this shell of ngc1360 as a prolate ellipsoidal shell with its polar axis tilted with respect to the line - of - sight by an inclination angle @xmath29 .",
    "its polar and equatorial radii are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and its polar and equatorial expansion velocities are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . for the assumed homologous expansion , @xmath34 is equal to @xmath32/@xmath33 , and the kinematic age is simply @xmath31/@xmath33 or @xmath30/@xmath32 .",
    "a grid of models are constructed for a range of inclination angles @xmath29 , axial ratios @xmath30/@xmath31 , and equatorial expansion velocities @xmath33 .",
    "these models are then used to synthesize nebular isophotes and to generate position - velocity ellipses for visual comparisons with the observations .",
    "our best - fit model is marked in figure 2 , and has the following parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath33 = 35 km  s@xmath6 at @xmath31 = 130 , @xmath32 = 70 km  s@xmath6 at @xmath30 = 260 , and @xmath36 = 10,000 yr .",
    "note that the inclination angle and the axial ratio are correlated so that lower values of @xmath29 yield higher ratios of @xmath32/@xmath33 . despite this fact , the inclination angle and the axial ratio are both well constrained .",
    "the former is within @xmath3710  from the optimal value , while the latter is within @xmath370.25 from @xmath32/@xmath33 = 2.0 .",
    "the expansion velocities and kinematic age , on the other hand , are not as well constrained . for @xmath29 = 60 , the uncertainty in @xmath33 is @xmath3710 km  s@xmath6 , corresponding to about @xmath3730% .",
    "bear in mind that this model describes only an outer layer of the nebular shell of ngc1360 .",
    "the bulk of the nebular material is interior to this layer and expands more slowly .",
    "this densest shell material is responsible for the peaks in the velocity profile . for an inclination angle of 60 , the velocity split near",
    "the nebular center roughly corresponds to twice the equatorial expansion velocity of the densest nebular material in ngc1360 , 24 km  s@xmath6 ( see fig .  3 and  3.2 ) . however , the detailed geometry and kinematics of this dense material can not be more precisely determined because the peaks of the line profiles do not form a well - defined position - velocity ellipse in the echelle image .",
    "the fliers in ngc1360 are projected along the apparent major axis of the nebula ; thus , it is reasonable to assume that the fliers are distributed along the polar axis with an inclination angle of 60 .",
    "the apparent expansion velocities of the fliers , @xmath3850 km  s@xmath6 , then correspond to deprojected expansion velocities of @xmath38100 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "these expansion velocities are typical of those observed in fliers @xcite .",
    "we can use the spatio - kinematic model of ngc1360 deduced in  4.1 along with the observed h@xmath0 surface brightness distribution to study the density structure within this nebula .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 surface brightness profiles along several pas are plotted in figure 5 .",
    "the depression in surface brightness seen in the eastern hemisphere of ngc1360 is clearly visible in the profiles along pas between 105  and 165 .",
    "in contrast , the surface brightness of the western hemisphere of ngc1360 shows smoother profiles , without obvious  bumps \" or  dents .",
    "\" we have carried out the analysis of the density structure of ngc1360 using the sections of the nebula between pa 225and 345  because their uniformity best represents the overall distribution of material in the nebular shell .    the profiles of the western regions of ngc1360 in figure 5 exhibit a gaussian shaped brightness distribution peaking at 4060  and declining smoothly with increasing radius .",
    "the smooth shapes of the surface brightness profiles indicate that the nebula does not contain any regions with sharp density or extinction variations in the western hemisphere .",
    "these surface brightness distributions , in conjunction with the geometric information determined from the spatio - kinematic modeling in  3.2 , can be used to derive the nebular density distribution .",
    "we have modeled the surface brightness profile assuming a gaussian density distribution and fitted this model to the observed h@xmath0 surface brightness profiles between pa 225  and 345 .",
    "the best - fit model peaks at 35  with a fwhm of 60  along the equatorial plane and peaks at 70  with a fwhm of 100  along the polar direction .",
    "the best - fit models are overplotted in figure 5 : good agreements are obtained from pa 225  to 345 . using the flux calibrated surface brightness",
    "we further determined that the peak density is @xmath1130 h - atom @xmath3 , and that the density at @xmath31 = 130  is @xmath10.1 h - atom @xmath3 .",
    "the low density at the outer edge of the nebula implies that it is beginning to merge into the interstellar medium .",
    "the total mass in the model , @xmath10.4 m@xmath39 , is estimated assuming that the surface brightness depressions in the eastern hemisphere are caused by internal dust absorption .",
    "if the lower surface brightness is caused by a lack of material in the shell , the mass would be over - estimated , but this error is small as compared to the uncertainty in mass due to the large error bar in the distance to ngc1360 .",
    "we have obtained images and high - dispersion long - slit spectra of ngc1360 in order to study its spatio - kinematic structure . we have modeled an outer layer of the shell as a prolate ellipsoid and find a major - to - minor axial ratio of 2:1 and a polar axis tilted by 60  with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the kinematic age derived from this model is @xmath110,000 yr .    we have found that the observed morphology and surface brightness profiles of ngc1360 can be modeled well by a thick shell with a gaussian radial density profile .",
    "this smooth density distribution implies that there is no sharp inner edge as expected from compression by a fast stellar wind . if a fast wind was present in the past and compressed the agb wind into a thin shell , that shell has since diffused .",
    "the low nebular density , @xmath2130 h - atom @xmath3 , suggests that ngc1360 is an evolved pn ; its low - density ( 0.1 h - atom @xmath3 ) envelope has begun to merge with the interstellar medium .",
    "the fliers observed in ngc1360 are intriguing .",
    "the kinematic age of the fliers , based on their de - projected distances from the central star , @xmath380.5 pc , and their de - projected expansion velocities , @xmath40 km  s@xmath6 , is @xmath15,000 yr .",
    "this kinematic age is about 1/2 that of the pn itself .",
    "ngc1360 is one of the very few cases of evolved pne in which collimated outflows are observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?"
