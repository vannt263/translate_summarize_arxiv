    "it is thought that supermassive black holes are the central engines of active galactic nuclei , and may inhabit the cores of most galaxies ( salpeter 1964 , zeldovich 1965 , lynden - bell 1969 ) .",
    "accretion disks around such objects provide some of the best natural laboratories for examining the effects of an extreme gravity environment on infalling material . with the enhanced throughput and spectral resolution of modern x - ray telescopes such as _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ , it has now become possible to observe these effects with the precision necessary to make robust measurements of the innermost properties and overall structures of accretion disks .",
    "evidence for relativistic emission line broadening , spectral and temporal variability over a wide range of time scales , and photoionized ( warm ) absorption from outflowing highly - ionized gas along the line of sight are only some of the interesting spectral detections being made in many active galaxies .    in this paper , we present an x - ray spectral analysis of the central regions of the canonical seyfert-1 galaxy , ngc  4593 .",
    "galaxies of this type are of particular interest for the study of accretion onto supermassive black holes since they are typically oriented such that we can view the accreting black hole free of substantial obscuration or absorption from surrounding circumnuclear material .",
    "furthermore , we believe that significant amounts of the continuum radiation seen in radio - quiet sy-1 galaxies originate in the disk rather than , for example , a relativistically beamed jet ( as is the case for bl - lac objects ) . as such ,",
    "we are better positioned to study the inner parts of the accretion disk in sy-1 galaxies than in other systems .",
    "ngc  4593 is a spiral galaxy with a central bar classified as hubble type sbb . at a redshift of @xmath6",
    ", it lies at a proper distance of @xmath7 toward the constellation virgo .",
    "this corresponds to an angular size distance of @xmath8 , and a luminosity distance of @xmath9 using @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the galaxy has an apparent visual magnitude of @xmath13 and an approximate angular diameter of @xmath14 arcmin .",
    "as already noted , it hosts an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of a sy-1 type ( lewis , macalpine & koski 1978 ) .",
    "previous studies of the source with _ exosat _ demonstrated a soft excess ( pounds & turner 1988 ) , and _ bepposax _ data confirm a broad absorption dip of @xmath15 below @xmath16 which may be attributable to the presence of a warm absorber along the line of sight ( kaastra & steenbrugge 2001 ) .",
    "_ asca _ spectra display a slightly broadened cold iron line at @xmath17 , in addition to evidence for a warm absorber within the system ( nandra 1997 ; reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "the source also displays significant variability in flux . between two _ asca _",
    "observations @xmath18 years apart , the @xmath19 flux of this source increased by @xmath20 , though no significant variability of the iron line was detected between the two pointings ( weaver 2001 ) . within the _ asca _ observation ,",
    "reynolds ( 1997 ) witnessed a count rate decrease of @xmath21 in @xmath22 , with smaller flares and dips throughout the data set . in terms of the overall properties of the system ,",
    "reynolds ( 1997 ) calculated a luminosity of @xmath23 ( @xmath19 ) with _ asca _ , and more recently , mckernan ( 2003 ) used _ chandra _ to derive a luminosity @xmath24 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it should be noted that this change in @xmath25 is larger than the flux calibration uncertainty of the observation , so this does appear to be a robust finding .    in this paper , we present a @xmath26 exposure of ngc  4593 with the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn instrument from 2002 june 23/24 .",
    "we discuss our observations of the time - averaged @xmath19 spectrum and cold iron line in more detail in reynolds ( 2004 ; hereafter r04 ) . here",
    ", we will examine the spectral and temporal variability of ngc  4593 , as well as the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    " 2 discusses the method and software employed for the reduction of the data referred to in this work .",
    "spectral fitting analysis is detailed for the epic - pn instrument in  3 , and variability studies are examined in  4 .",
    "we present our discussion in  5 , including a comparison of our results with those published in earlier studies of ngc  4593 and a discussion of the disparate spatial scales implied for the x - ray emitting region and the iron fluorescence region .",
    "we also draw our conclusions in  5 .",
    "in this paper , we use data taken with the european photon imaging camera pn ( epic - pn ) camera .",
    "the data were obtained during revolution 465 of _ xmm - newton _ , during which the pn was operated in its small - window mode to prevent photon pile up , using the medium filter to avoid optical light contamination .",
    "the epic mos-1 camera took data in the fast uncompressed timing mode , and the mos-2 camera operated in prime partial w2 imaging mode . although the mos results will not be discussed further here , they mirrored the epic - pn data within the expected errors of calibration effects .",
    "the average epic - pn count rate for this source was @xmath27 .",
    "data were also collected during the observation by the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) .",
    "these data were examined but were deemed to be unhelpful for the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "firstly , the rgs spectra have insufficient signal - to - noise to allow a detailed study of the soft x - ray emission and absorption lines from the warm absorber in this source .",
    "they also contain insufficient counts to allow variability analysis .",
    "finally , our examination of the rgs spectra have demonstrated that problems with the _ broad - band _ effective area calibration of the rgs ( which is strongly affected by a build - up of carbon on the ccds ) compromises any rgs - based results on the shape of the soft excess . for a detailed discussion of these calibration uncertainties , see kirsch ( 2005 ) .",
    "for these reasons , will shall not consider rgs data further .",
    "the pipeline data were reprocessed using the science analysis software and the corresponding calibration files , version 6.5.0 . from these , we rebuilt the calibration index file using cifbuild . for the epic - pn data",
    "the event files were mildly edited in spectral coverage to observe the region from @xmath28 , and bad pixels and cosmic ray spikes were removed via narrow time filtering using the evselect task within the sas .",
    "no background flares were detected during the observation .",
    "extraction of spectra followed the procedure used by wilms ( 2001 ) , in which source and background spectra were generated using the xmmselect task .",
    "response matrices and ancillary response files were created using rmfgen and arfgen , and the data were then grouped using the grppha task with a binning factor of @xmath29 .",
    "binning is required in order to get sufficient counts per bin to make @xmath30 spectral fitting a valid statistical process .",
    "spectral modeling and analysis from @xmath0 was performed using the xspec package version 11.3.2 .",
    "( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "timing studies were performed using various routines in the xronos package ( stella & angelini 1991 ) .",
    "we have used the sas epatplot task to compute the fraction of single , double , triple and quadruple events as a function of energy and compared these fractions to their nominal values as measured from weak source observations . for sources that are affected by pile up ,",
    "these fractions deviate from the nominal values due to the higher probability of wrong pattern classification .",
    "no significant deviation from the nominal single and double distributions was found , indicating that our epic - pn observation of ngc  4593 is not affected by pile up .",
    "as shown in r04 , the 210kev epic - pn spectrum of ngc  4593 is very well described by a power - law with the exception of two emission features identified as the fluorescent k@xmath1 emission line of cold iron at 6.4kev and the ly@xmath1 recombination line of hydrogen - like iron at 6.97kev ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the cold iron line likely arises from fluorescence on the surface layers of the outer accretion disk , optically - thick optical broad emission line clouds , or the putative `` molecular torus '' in response to hard x - ray irradiation from a hot corona in the inner accretion disk ( basko 1978 ; guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; matt 1991 ) . the ionized line , by contrast ,",
    "could be formed either by ionized disk irradiation or by radiative recombination in highly - ionized outflowing material above the plane of the disk .",

    "note the residual iron features at @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath31 . ]",
    "however , extrapolating below @xmath32 reveals a clear soft excess as well as the effects of the warm absorber ( fig .  2 ;",
    "the `` notch '' in the range 0.71.0kev signals the presence of the warm absorber ) .",
    "since the basic origin of such soft excesses are still the subject of much debate , it is interesting to characterize the soft excess in as much detail as possible .",
    "this necessitates , however , a detailed modeling of the warm absorber .",
    "we model the effect of the warm absorber using the xstar photoionization code ( version 2.1kn3 ; originally developed by kallman & krolik 1995 ) . in detail , we construct grids of models describing absorption by photoionized slabs of matter with column density @xmath33 and ionization parameter @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the luminosity above the hydrogen lyman limit , @xmath37 is the electron number density of the plasma and @xmath38 is the distance from the ( point ) source is ionizing luminosity .",
    "we have constructed @xmath39 grids of models uniformly sampling the @xmath40 plane in the range @xmath41 and @xmath42 . while these were made to be multiplicative absorption models and",
    "hence can be applied to any emission spectrum , the ionization balance was solved assuming a power - law ionizing spectrum with a photon index of @xmath43 , cut off at an energy @xmath44 .",
    "this is a good approximation of the typical agn continuum .",
    "spectrum of ngc  4593 fit with the photoabsorbed power - law from fig .  1 and two gaussians to model the iron lines .",
    "note the clear evidence for a soft excess , possibly complicated by absorption features from a `` warm absorber '' within ngc 4593 .",
    "for this fit , @xmath45 . ]    as a first , purely phenomenalogical attempt to describe the soft excess component , we have employed a single temperature thermal bremsstrahlung emission model ( zbremss ) . to adequately describe the spectrum , we were required to include two warm absorbing zones as well as an iron - l@xmath46 edge from iron atoms in line - of - sight dust .",
    "a natural interpretation is that the wa has distinct components at physically different distances from the central engine .",
    "we note that attempting to add a third zone into the model results in no statistical improvement in fit . including this absorption structure provides a good description of the data ( @xmath47 ; fig .  3 and table  1 ) .",
    "we shall refer to this model as model-1 .",

    "other absorption components are indicated in black.,title=\"fig : \" ]    of course , the description of the soft excess in model-1 is purely phenomenalogical in nature .",
    "ideally , we would like to describe the soft excess with a model that has a direct physical interpretation .",
    "initially , we attempt to describe the soft excess as soft x - ray reflection from a mildly - ionized accretion disk ( see brenneman & reynolds 2006 for a successful application of this model to the seyfert galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ) .",
    "operationally , we replace the thermal bremsstrahlung component in model  1 with the ionized disk model reflion created by ross & fabian ( 2005 ) . because the irradiated matter is also responsible for producing the fe - k@xmath1 line in many sources , this model has the potential advantage of self - consistently describing the soft excess as well as the 6.4kev emission line feature .",
    "interestingly , we find that we _ can not _ successfully describe both the soft emission and the fe - k@xmath1 line with the disk reflection model .",
    "the resulting best fit is @xmath50 , and we found that significant residuals remained on the soft and hard ends of the spectra . even adding the gaussian component back to explicitly model the @xmath17 iron line ( and hence removing the constraint that the disk reflection must describe this feature ) , the disk reflection model was unable to adequately fit the form of the soft excess .",
    "we thus conclude that ionized disk reflection is not an important process in shaping the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc  4593 .",
    "given the relative narrowness of the fe - k@xmath1 line in this source we believe it is not originating in the inner disk , and hence the above is not a surprising conclusion .",
    "alternatively , we can postulate that the soft excess is due to thermal comptonization by plasma at a temperature between that of the disk and the hard x - ray corona ( possibly in a transition zone ) .",
    "operationally , we use the comptt model ( titarchuk 1994 ) to model the soft excess .",
    "hereafter , we shall refer to this spectral model as model  2 .",
    "this preserves the physical realism of the soft emission arising from the accretion disk , but allows the iron line to be produced elsewhere , perhaps farther away in the molecular torus where it would not be as broad by nature .",
    "model  2 reaches a best fit of @xmath51 .",
    "the best fit and model for model  2 is shown in fig .",
    "we have frozen the seed photon temperature at @xmath52 and have kept a slab geometry for the corona .",
    "the best fit comptonizing plasma temperature is @xmath53 with an optical depth of @xmath54 , though both parameters were not very well constrained by the fit .",
    "this is not surprising , given that both are equally involved in shaping the spectrum via the compton - y parameter : @xmath55 .",
    "we note that for model  2 the equivalent widths of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 gaussians remain approximately unchanged from their values in the model  1 fit .    .",

    "the total @xmath0 flux is @xmath56 . assuming a flat universe wmap cosmology , this corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath57 . considering only the energy range from @xmath19 , @xmath58 .",
    "this is roughly @xmath59 greater than the @xmath19 luminosity observed by mckernan ( 2003 ) , but only about @xmath60 of the value from the _ asca _ observation reported by reynolds ( 1997 ) .",
    "the warm absorber modeled with our two created xstar tables suggests a multi - zone structure in column density and ionization , as discussed above .",
    "though our model does not parameterize the covering fraction of the absorbing gas , we can approximate this fraction by representing the warm absorber with the ovii and oviii edges at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , as has been done by many other authors examining warm absorbers ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 ; mckernan 2003 ) .",
    "in so doing , we find that to @xmath63 confidence , the ovii edge has an optical depth of @xmath64 whereas the oviii edge is much less prominent at @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore chose to use the ovii edge as a diagnostic for determining the covering fraction of the absorbing gas in ngc  4593 . if the o vii edge accounts for the absorption by this gas , the photons absorbed should be reprocessed and radiated in emission as the ovii radiative recombination line at @xmath66 . assuming that this line will be narrow , we fit a gaussian to the data . adding in this component bettered the overall goodness - of - fit by @xmath67 as compared to the two - edge model for the warm absorber , showing that this line is statistically robust .",

    "the light curves for all three bands are represented in fig .",
    "10 . in order to test whether a time lag exists between these energy bands ,",
    "we compute the cross - correlation function between the three energy bands using the xronos package ( stella & angelini 1991 ) as well as the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) .",
    "we measured the hard - to - soft band lag to be @xmath149 ( i.e. , the hard band lags the soft band by this amount of time ; fig .",
    "11 ) .    .",
    "inverting this means that the smallest timescale of variability we can reliably observe from this source is @xmath150 . at low frequencies ,",

    "inverting this means that the smallest timescale of variability we can reliably observe from this source is @xmath150 . at low frequencies ,",
    "the slope of the power spectral density curve is @xmath144.,title=\"fig : \" ]     ( solid black ) , the mid band runs from @xmath151 ( dashed red ) , and the hard band runs from @xmath152 ( dotted green ) . ]    the most straightforward interpretation of these time delays envisions them as representing the finite scattering time within the comptonizing disk - corona system that is thought to be responsible for the primary x - ray production .",
    "one should be cautioned , however , that this interpretation invokes numerous underlying simplifications with regard to the physical mechanism that produces these types of time lags between energy bands .",
    "see pottschmidt ( 2003 ) and nowak ( 1999 , 2002 ) for more detailed accounts of other factors that can be responsible for or affect the observed time lag between the hard and soft energy bands .",
    "we assume here that both the hard and soft x - ray photons originate from seed uv photons from the disk , which are then comptonized by a corona of relativistic electrons surrounding the disk .",
    "the energy of a given photon in our simplified scheme will thus depend on the number of scatterings it undergoes with the electrons , and one may therefore infer that the more energetic photons have experienced more interactions .",
    "it is thus possible to estimate the size of the coronal region by measuring the time lag between the peaks of the hard and soft photon light curves of the source , as we have done , and making the simplified assumption that the corona possesses a slab or spherical geometry . with each scattering ,",
    "a seed photon gains on average a fractional energy @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the temperature of the electrons in the corona .",
    "so the energy of a comptonized photon after a given number of scatterings will be : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the initial seed photon energy and @xmath157 is the number of scatterings ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ; chiang et al . 2000 ) . the time delay of this photon relative to the seed photon source will be roughly proportional to the number of scatterings , @xmath158 . here",
    "@xmath159 where @xmath160 is the mean free path for thomson scattering in an optically - thick corona or , if the corona is optically - thin , simply the size of the corona .",
    "we take the effective photon energy in the soft range ( @xmath146 ) to be @xmath161 . for the hard range ( @xmath162 )",
    "we calculate the effective photon energy to be @xmath163 .",
    "both estimates are based on taking weighted averages ( based on flux ) of the energies in the soft and hard ranges , and accounting for the energy - dependent effective area of the pn .",
    "assuming that the energy of the coronal electrons ranges from @xmath164 , our measured soft - hard time lag of @xmath165 suggests that the corona occupies a region around the disk @xmath166 in size .",
    "this is derived assuming the size of the corona is given by @xmath167 we will assume that the central black hole in ngc  4593 has a mass of @xmath168 based on reverberation mapping ( nelson & whittle 1995 ; gebhardt et al . 2000 ) .",
    "using this mass for the ngc  4593 black hole , the characteristic length scale of the corona would be in the range of @xmath169 .     at @xmath63 confidence . ]",
    "we have obtained a @xmath128 _ xmm - newton _ observation of the sy-1 galaxy ngc  4593 .",
    "an examination of the best fitting epic - pn spectrum shows that the continuum is well modeled by a photoabsorbed power - law with @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and a flux of @xmath172 .",
    "the best fit to the hard spectrum can be achieved by including two gaussian emission lines representing cold and ionized fluorescent iron at @xmath2 and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "we see clear evidence for a complex warm absorber in the epic - pn spectrum .",
    "fitting a grid of photoionization models computed using the xstar code , we infer a warm absorber with two physically and kinematically distinct zones : one with a column density of @xmath174 and an ionization parameter of @xmath175 , the other with @xmath176 and @xmath177 , which is likely more distant from the central engine .",
    "we robustly detect the l@xmath46 edge of neutral iron presumed to exist in the form of dust grains along the line - of - sight to the central engine , as cited by mckernan ( 2003 ) .",
    "this edge has a column density of @xmath178 .",
    "a soft excess below @xmath179 is also seen in the data , and can be accounted for either phenomenalogically by a redshifted bremsstrahlung component ( model  1 ) or , more effectively and physically , a component of comptonized emission from an accretion disk of seed photons upscattered by a plasma of relativistic electrons existing in either a corona or the base of a jet near the disk in some geometry ( model  2 ) .",
    "the latter scenario yields the best statistical fit to the data , with a seed photon temperature of @xmath180 , an electron temperature of @xmath181 , a plasma optical depth of @xmath182 and a flux of @xmath183 .",
    "lastly , cold and ionized fe - k emission lines were wanted by the fit at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the cold line gaussian had a time - averaged equivalent width of @xmath184 , while the ionized component had an @xmath185 .",
    "although the continuum varied with time over the course of our observation , the flux of the cold fe - k@xmath1 showed marginal evidence for variability between successive @xmath123 intervals .",
    "the equivalent width of this line , on the other hand , is shown to vary significantly .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this result is to suppose that the cold line originates from a region with a light - crossing time larger that the length of our observation . for a black hole mass of @xmath168 ,",
    "this places the cold line emitting region beyond about @xmath186 from the black hole , i.e. , in the outer accretion disk or the putative molecular torus of seyfert unification schemes .",
    "our statistics on the ionized fe - k line are insufficient to constrain its variability properties  these data are consistent with both constant flux and constant equivalent width .",
    "we have detected a @xmath187 time - lag between the hard and soft epic - pn bands , with the hard band lagging the soft . in a simple model in which this corresponds to scattering times within a comptonizing corona ,",
    "we conclude that the corona can only possess a size of @xmath188 .",
    "the narrowness of the fluorescent iron line together with the lack of response of this line to changes in the hard x - ray continuum suggest an absence of a cold , optically - thick matter within the central @xmath189 of the accretion disk .",
    "the standard framework for accommodating such a result is to postulate that the inner regions ( @xmath190 ) of the accretion flow have entered into a radiatively - inefficient mode which is extremely hot ( electron temperatures of @xmath191 ) , optically - thin , and geometrically - thick ( e.g. , rees 1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 ) . within this framework ,",
    "the hard x - ray source is identified as thermal bremsstrahlung or comptonization from this structure .",
    "however , the variability of the x - ray continuum is inconsistent with x - ray emission from a structure which is @xmath192 in extent .",
    "the rapid continuum variability and the short time lag between the hard and soft x - ray photons dictate that , at any given time , the x - ray emission region is only @xmath193 in extent .",
    "we are therefore led to consider alternative geometries and/or origins for the x - ray source .",
    "we consider three possibilities .",
    "firstly , the inner accretion flow may indeed be radiatively - inefficient , but the observed x - ray emission may come from the compact base of a relativistic jet powered by black hole spin . secondly , the x - ray emission may indeed originate from the body of the radiately - inefficient flow but , at any given instant in time , be dominated by very compact emission regions within the flow .",
    "such emission regions may be arise naturally from the turbulent flow or , instead , may be related to a magnetic interaction between the inner parts of the flow and the central spinning black hole ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ; ye et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this case",
    "the iron line could still plausibly originate at a distance of thousands of @xmath194 and thus be quite narrow .",
    "finally , it is possible that the accretion disk is radiatively-_efficient _ ( and hence optically - thick and geometrically - thin ) close to the black hole and supports a compact accretion disk corona . of course , an immediate objection to this scenario is the lack of a broadened iron line .",
    "however , as demonstrated in r04 , it is possible the iron line is so broad that it is buried in the noise of the continuum .",
    "alternatively , the accretion disk surface may have an ionization state such that iron line photons are effectively trapped by resonant scattering and destroyed by the auger effect .",
    "longer observations with better spectral and timing resolution will be necessary in order to confirm our results and differentiate between these different possible scenarios .",
    "we have shown that the sy-1 galaxy ngc  4593 has a continuum spectrum that is fit remarkably well by a simple photoabsorbed power - law above @xmath179 .",
    "below this energy , we see evidence for spectral complexity that can be attributed to the presence of a possible multi - zone layer of absorbing material intrinsic to the source , as well as a soft excess that can not be explained by a reflection model from an ionized disk . also arguing against a disk - reflection - dominated source",
    "is that unlike other sources of its kind ( e.g. , mcg6 - 30 - 15 ) , ngc  4593 has relatively narrow cold and ionized fe - k@xmath1 line features at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "see r04 for a more thorough discussion of these lines and their possible physical interpretations .",
    "we can say that the cold line is most likely formed either quite far out in the accretion disk , or possibly in the putative dusty torus region surrounding the central engine , based on their narrowness and lack of significant variability over the @xmath128 duration of our observation .",
    "we find no evidence for reflection features from the inner accretion disk ( e.g. , a `` broad iron line '' ) in the spectrum .",
    "based on the time lag between the soft and hard spectral bands , we estimate that the corona occupies the a region around the central source on the order of @xmath195 , assuming that ngc  4593 harbors a @xmath168 black hole at its core and that the energies of the electrons in the corona range from @xmath196 .",
    "this estimate for the coronal size is reinforced by our measurements of continuum variability on timescales as small as @xmath197 , equivalent to a light travel time of @xmath198 for the black hole mass in question .",
    "taken together , the implications of a narrow iron line emitted far out in the disk or torus and the small coronal size in ngc  4593 present an atypical picture of an agn .",
    "we postulate that the primary x - ray source is associated with the compact base of a jet or compact emission regions within a much larger optically - thin accretion flow . alternatively",
    ", the accretion disk may be radiatively - efficient with a compact corona but not display a broad iron line due to the effects of extreme broadening or disk ionization .",
    "we thank andrew young for numerous helpful conversations throughout the course of this work .",
    "julia lee provided several xstar models we used in attempting to parameterize the spectrum from @xmath199 .",

    "chandra _ has also proven invaluable .",
