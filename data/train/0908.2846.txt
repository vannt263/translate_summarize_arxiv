    "understanding when and how the most massive galaxies in the universe formed is one of the most outstanding problems in cosmology and galaxy formation ( conselice et al .",
    "2007 ) . at @xmath13 ,",
    "the most recent results seem now to agree in indicating that the majority of massive galaxies were already in place at z@xmath14 0.7 - 0.8 , with a number density consistent with the one at @xmath15 ( yamada et al .",
    "2005 ; cimatti et al . 2006",
    "; bundy et al .",
    "however , despite the remarkable success in finding and studying massive galaxies over a wide range of cosmic time , the global picture is far from being clear , especially for massive galaxies at redshift @xmath16 ( cimatti et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys in the optical and near - infrared indicate that most of the massive galaxies at @xmath17 are extremely red objects ( hereafter eros , such as cimatti et al .",
    "2004 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ; conselice et al .",
    "therefore , eros are largely the test bed for galaxy models , and understanding their properties is an important test of the physics behind galaxy formation .",
    "eros , which are defined as objects having red optical - to - infrared colors , such as @xmath18 or @xmath19 in the vega - based magnitude system , were first discovered by deep near - infrared surveys by elston , rieke , and rieke ( 1988 ) . since",
    "then many authors have detected eros in near - infrared surveys ( mccarthy et al . 1992 ; thompson et al .",
    "1999 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 ; kong et al .",
    "such very red colors can be produced by high - redshift ( @xmath16 ) old elliptical galaxies ( hereafter ogs ) with intrinsically red spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and can also be produced by dusty starburst galaxies whose uv luminosities are strongly absorbed by large amounts of internal dust ( hereafter dgs ; hu & ridgway 1994 ; graham & dey 1996 ; smith et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "eros continue to attract considerable interest . on the one hand",
    ", the research in the literature suggests that they may well be the high - redshift counterparts and progenitors of local massive e and s0 galaxies .",
    "these two classes of eros may represent different phases in the formation and evolution of high - redshift massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "the number densities of ogs provide the strongest constraints on models of galaxy evolution ( gonzalez - perez et al . 2008 ) . on the other hand",
    ", dgs could be related to the ultraluminous ir galaxies producing the bulk of the total energy in the universe since the recombination era ( elbaz & cesarsky 2003 ) .",
    "the properties of eros , specifically the fraction of ogs and dgs , are therefore a crucial test of galaxy formation theories , and will improve our ability to make complete measurements of the star formation history of the universe ( cimatti et al . 2004 ; glazebrook et al . 2004 ; renzini 2006 ) .",
    "many groups are currently investigating the fractions of these two ero populations using a variety of observational approaches ( such as moriondo et al .",
    "2000 ; stiavelli & treu 2001 ; mannucci et al .",

    "2006 ; conselice et al .",
    "2008 ; fang et al .",
    "2009 ) , but the fraction of ogs and dgs from different survey is different , even the same classified method was used . therefore , their reliable classification and study , in particular the relative fraction of different ero types , can provide crucial constraints on the evolution of massive , starburst , dusty , and/or ultraluminous infrared galaxies known to exist at higher redshift , e.g. , bzk galaxies , distant red galaxies , and submillimeter and ir - luminous lyman break galaxies .",
    "since eros are rare and clustered , wide - field surveys are essential for studies of the statistical properties of eros ( daddi et al . 2000 ;",
    "roche et al .",
    "2002 ; kong et al .",
    "2006 ) . therefore , one possibility of the difference among previous works is that the ero samples are small .",
    "the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) , the largest contiguous survey ever with @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , provides for the first time a combined data set capable of simultaneously exploring large - scale structure and detailed galaxy properties ( luminosity , size , color , morphology , nuclear activity ) out to a redshift approaching @xmath20 .",

    "the cosmos project is centered upon a complete survey in the f814w band ( central wavelength at 8332  , with width 2510  ) using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board @xmath4 of an area of 2 deg@xmath40 ( scoville et al .",

    "166 hours of observations with the @xmath5 irac camera ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) have been dedicated to cover the entire 2 deg@xmath40 cosmos field .",
    "the field has been observed simultaneously in the four irac channels@xmath473.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath30 m .",
    "54 hours of observations with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) camera ( rieke et al .",

    "more details and a full description of the @xmath5 data processing are provided in sanders et al .",
    "compared to optical , the near - infrared selection ( in particular in the @xmath29 band ) offers several advantages , including the relative insensitivity of the @xmath48-corrections to the galaxy type even at high redshift , the less severe dust extinction effects , the weaker dependence on the instantaneous star formation activity , and a tighter correlation with the stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "therefore , the studies of faint galaxy samples selected in the near - infrared have long been recognized as ideal tools to study the process of mass assembly at high redshift ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1992 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; cimatti et al .",

    "therefore , we selected objects in the cosmos survey using the k - band limiting magnitude .    the limiting magnitude ( in ab ) of the @xmath11band image",
    "was defined as the brightness corresponding to 5@xmath49 on a 3@xmath50 diameter aperture for an isolated point source by capak et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , the value is @xmath46 ( ab ) .",
    "the edges of the @xmath11band image have low signal - to - noise value , therefore , the area , as discussed in this paper , was reduced from the cosmos 2 deg@xmath40 to 1.82 deg@xmath40 .",
    "3234,836 objects were detected and included in the capak et al.s * all * catalog ( v20060103 ) , and 2797,708 of them are in the 1.82 deg@xmath40 area ( capak et al .",
    "we selected objects to @xmath51 ( @xmath29-band total magnitude , @xmath52 in ab ) , over a total sky area of 1.82 deg@xmath40 .",
    "the total magnitudes were defined as the brightest between the kron automatic aperture magnitudes and the corrected aperture magnitude .",
    "the aperture corrections were estimated from the difference between the kron automatic aperture magnitudes and the 3@xmath53 aperture magnitudes .",
    "simulations of point sources show that in all the area the completeness is well above 90% at this k - band level .    therefore , we selected objects to @xmath51 , over a total sky area of 1.82 deg@xmath40 , and 34,391 objects are included in our final catalog .",
    "stellar objects are isolated with the color criterion @xmath54 ( daddi et al .",

    "figure  [ fig : numc ] shows a comparison of k - band number counts in the cosmos survey with a compilation of literature counts .",
    "the red- , green- , and blue - filled squares correspond to the counts of field galaxies in the cosmos ( this paper ) , daddi - f , and deep3a - f ( kong et al .",
    "2006 ) , respectively . as shown in the figure , our counts are in good agreement with those of previous surveys .",

    "model seds are adopted from the kodama & arimoto s ( 1997 ; ka97 ) population synthesis library .",
    "ordinary late - type galaxies never reach red color , while both early - type galaxies and reddened late - type galaxies cross the @xmath57 line when seen beyond @xmath58 . therefore ,",
    "in this paper we define eros as objects whose @xmath55 color is equal to or redder than 2.45 in ab , which is similar to @xmath59 in vega .",

    "we refer to these objects as the ero sample .",
    "the @xmath29-band differential number counts of the eros in the cosmos field ( red triangles ) are shown in figure .",
    "[ fig : numc ] , together with those in deep3a - f ( blue triangles ) and daddi - f ( green triangles ; kong et al .",
    "2006 ) . from this figure",
    ", we found that the counts of cosmos match very well with those of deep3a - f and daddi - f .",
    "it can be explained easily , since the areas of those three fields are large ( from @xmath63 arcmin@xmath40 to 1.82 deg@xmath40 ) , the field - to - field variation in the number counts is very small .",
    "another feature seen in previous surveys , which we also see , is a turnover in the slope of the counts at @xmath64 , being steeper at bright magnitudes and flattening out toward faint magnitudes . as we saw in figure",
    "[ fig : ik - k](b ) , and will see in figure  [ fig : photoz](b ) , @xmath55 color cut can effectively remove the @xmath65 foreground from galaxy surveys .",
    "the steep slope of the counts at relatively bright magnitudes reflects the exponential cutoff of the galaxy luminosity function . unlike the full @xmath29-selected counts",
    ", the red color - selected objects span a fairly narrow redshift range , and thus the shape of the counts closely reflects the shape of the luminosity function , i.e. , most of the eros are luminous galaxies",
    ".    then we match our ero sample with the s - cosmos data ( sanders et al .",
    "the catalog of s - cosmos irac go2 delivery ( v27may2007 ) includes photometry in the four irac channels for all those sources that have a measured flux in irac channel 1 ( 3.6 @xmath30 m above 1 @xmath30jy ) , 345,512 objects were included .",
    "we match the 5264 eros in our sample with the s - cosmos irac catalog , using a 2@xmath66 radius around the subaru @xmath27-band position , and 5255 eros have irac counterparts , nine eros have not irac counterparts .",
    "we also match our ero sample with the s - cosmos mips - ge go2 delivery ( v27may2007 ) , and found 325 of them have counterparts in the mips 24 @xmath30 m catalog .",
    "since eros can be divided into two broad classes , passively evolving ogs and dgs , the populations should be differentiated before we attempt to analyze their properties . in this section",
    ", we shall classify our eros into two classes , using three different methods : sed fitting , infrared color , and morphology . in the last subsection",
    ", we also perform the pca method to our eros sample , and discuss the differences .      an sed fitting technique based on an updated version of the @xmath67 code ( bolzonella et al .",
    "2000 ) is used to classify our ero sample into different type , dusty and evolved using their multi - waveband photometric properties .",
