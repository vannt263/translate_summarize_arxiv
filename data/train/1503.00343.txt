    "historically , the eikonal approximation was first introduced in relation to light scattering  @xcite . since then , such theory has been extensively applied not only in optics but also in atomic and molecular physics , quantum field theory , high energy physics , etc . the first application to modern theories was the analysis of scattering processes of energetic particles , as originally proposed by molire  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the molire approximation was the interpretation of particle trajectories as classical , straight line paths , which can be explained provided that the de broglie wavelength of the scattered particle is small compared with the size of the scatterer  @xcite .",
    "the pioneering work of glauber  @xcite extended the molire eikonal to the interaction of fast particles with complex atomic and nuclear systems , and established the basis of an exceptionally valuable technique to treat scattering processes at high energies .",
    "after the theoretical basis were set , the eikonal approximation ( ea ) was successfully applied to more complex systems . for example , it was applied for the treatment of the inverse bremsstralung heating , which involves the electron scattering by a potential in the presence of intense electromagnetic fields  @xcite . in the original work of choudhury and bakar  @xcite , and of zon  @xcite , the scattering amplitude was obtained by using the ea for the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation and the laser field was considered as a monochromatic plane wave .",
    "the dipole approximation was extensively used in such calculations .",
    "kristi and mittleman  @xcite have shown that , for ionization in strong laser fields , the electron motion should be treated relativistically and the dipole approximation is not good enough to determine correctly the electron energy distribution and the transition rate as a function of the laser intensity . in order to account for those facts ,",
    "the systematic eikonal perturbation theory was formulated by kamiski  @xcite for the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation and the relativistic klein - gordon equation . for nonrelativistic case",
    "the dipole approximation for the laser pulse was used and applied to free - free transitions , whereas for the relativistic one the finite , in general , laser pulses in the plane - wave fronted approximation were considered .",
    "note that the approach developed by kamiski in  @xcite was based on the proper - time method , which for propagators in quantum theories was proposed by fock  @xcite , and further developed by schwinger  @xcite , and by fradkin and co - workers  @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that , for potential scattering in the presence of strong fields , the ea has certain limitations .",
    "specifically , such a theory can not be applied in regions far from the potential interaction zone  @xcite .",
    "other considerations restrict the ea just to moderate laser intensities  @xcite . the so - called generalized eikonal approximation ( gea ) , which is the first order term of the eikonal perturbation theory  @xcite , overcame part of the mentioned problems by including certain quantum properties of the system in the eikonal limit .",
    "the inclusion of such terms extended the range of applicability of the theory to large distances from the interaction site  @xcite allowing a proper treatment of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the gea was further extended to solving the relativistic dirac equation in order to account approximately for the electron spin effects  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the so - called eikonal - volkov approximation was introduced to treat strong - field ionization of atoms .",
    "this consisted in including the laser field in full extent by means of the volkov wave function , together with the ionic potential treated within the ea ( see , for instance , also refs .",
    "this approach was further developed by smirnova _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to describe molecular ionization .",
    "it included the dynamical analysis of the electrons according to complex trajectories , which is a powerful tool for the overall understanding of the process ( for complex trajectory method , see , for instance , recent reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "another way to treat the photoionization by intense laser fields is the so - called strong field approximation ( sfa ) , sometimes recognized as the keldysh - faisal - reiss or kfr theory  @xcite .",
    "the principal idea of the sfa approach is that , after the photoelectron appears in the continuum , it is treated as a free particle interacting with the laser field , ignoring any interaction with the nuclear potential during its excursion .",
    "even though the sfa theory is known as one of the most fruitful analytical approaches in strong - field physics , its application can be justified for short range potentials only , not for the coulomb type potentials present during ionization of neutral atoms or positively charged ions ( see , also the most recent review by popruzhenko  @xcite ) .",
    "the sfa theory gives , in general , a very good qualitative agreement with experimental and numerical results for laser light of moderate intensities in interaction with a short range potential  @xcite but it fails to account for several well - documented spectral characteristics , including the wrong predictions obtained for the total ionization rate in the static field limit  @xcite .",
    "various methods have been proposed for taking the coulomb interaction into account within the sfa . except of the aforementioned eikonal - volkov approach  @xcite , it has been done , for instance , by means of the coulomb - volkov anzatz  @xcite which accounts for the asymptotic phase of the atomic field - free wave function . in this context also ,",
    "the saddle point method was reformulated in terms of quantum trajectories by popov and co - workers  @xcite , by gribakin and kuchiev  @xcite , and reviewed recently by popruzhenko  @xcite .",
    "the quantum trajectories together with a detailed analysis of the saddle point equations , have shown to make considerable improvements in the sfa to include the coulomb interactions  @xcite . in our paper",
    ", we use the quantum trajectories as presented in ref .",
    "note that the extension of this method to the dirac equation has been also reported  @xcite .    in the present paper we propose a generalization of the eikonal approximation , in order to analyze the photoionization of atoms or ions by short laser pulses .",
    "this approach avoids a singularity at the center of the binding potential and , in contrast to the ea , can be analyzed in terms of quantum trajectories . in sec .",
    "[ sec::theory ] , we set the physical and mathematical basis of the gea and derive an analytical expression for the ionization amplitude including the binding potential interaction .",
    "we show how the ea is obtained as a special case of the gea for short times or for large distances from the potential center . in the same way",
    ", we demonstrate that the first born approximation can be directly derived from our more general approach .",
    "[ combs ] is devoted to the numerical analysis of the photoelectron spectra generated by hydrogen interacting with an intense short pulse .",
    "using both the keldysh theory and the gea theory , we discuss the coherent diffraction pattern in the photoelectron energy spectra and the role played by the atomic potential .",
    "we present our concluding remarks in sec .",

    "[ skieldysh1bisd20150106],width=264 ]    the enhancement of the ionization yield can create some doubts about the validity of eikonal perturbation theory . let us note , however , that the perturbation is carried out in the exponent . in this particular case , the applicability condition for this approximation is such that in eq .   the eikonal term @xmath319 should be much smaller than the zeroth - order term , @xmath244 , for both the real and imaginary parts .",
    "this condition is very well fulfilled for the laser pulse intensity considered in this paper .",
    "now the question arises : to what extent the gea is better than the ea ? to answer this question , in fig .",
    "[ skieldysh1bisd20150106 ] we compare the predictions of both approaches .",
    "the thin black line represents the results calculated based on the keldysh theory while the blue thick line is for the gea .",
    "the ea results are represented by the red dashed line . in each case , the saddle point method was used .",
    "the energy spectra presented in the upper panel are for the one - cycle pulse , @xmath320 .",
    "we observe a rather marginal difference between the gea and ea results , and a significant enhancement ( by roughly one order of magnitude ) of these distributions as compared to the keldysh approximation .",
    "qualitatively , however , all three distributions look similar .",
    "the differences appear for longer pulses , when @xmath321 .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panel for @xmath322 .",
    "for electron kinetic energy @xmath323 the distributions for generalized and original eikonals differ significantly .",
    "however , for @xmath324 ( which is not shown in the figure ) both approaches again give nearly the same results .",
    "the wiggles observed for the ea distribution can be explained if we note that for the laser field parameters considered in this figure the ponderomotive energy is close to @xmath325 , which means that the structure appears for @xmath326 .",
    "it is well - known that for such energetic photoelectrons some of the complex trajectories can return very close to the origin of the coulomb potential . as we have checked , this is the case here .",
    "since the original eikonal is singular for such trajectories , we observe the rapid change of @xmath327 when the kinetic energy passes through the value @xmath119 ( in the considered case the real parts of @xmath327 exhibit the sharp peaks for these particular trajectories ) .",
    "this results in wiggles observed in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ skieldysh1bisd20150106 ] for the ea .",
    "such a behavior , however , is not observed for the gea , as it is not singular for trajectories returning to the potential origin .",
    "if we compare the gea with the keldysh approach , we see the enhancement of ionization but again the distributions are qualitatively similar . in our opinion ,",
    "the lack of spurious behavior for trajectories returning back to the vicinity of the parent ion and the fact that the first born approximation is the limiting case of the gea make the approach presented in this paper an attractive tool for investigations of ionization , rescattering , and high - order harmonic generation by strong laser pulses .",
    "this includes also more complex systems such as two - atom molecules or fullerenes .    in the literature ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) two names for the method , _ quantum trajectories _ and _ complex - time trajectories _ , are frequently used . in light of our analysis and more thorough studies carried out , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the second name seems to be more appropriate , as the trajectory @xmath328 satisfies the newton equation with the classical binding potential @xmath329 but with the complex initial conditions . in such a formulation of the method",
    ", there are no quantum signatures in the definition of @xmath328 .",
    "this approach , however , leads to some problems related to the coulomb singularity at the origin .",
    "in quantum theory ( for the schrdinger and dirac equations ) , this singularity does not create any difficulties .",
    "our investigations show that this obstacle can also be eliminated in the complex - time method . indeed , the form of the effective lagrangian   suggests to assume that",
    ", up to the first order of eikonal perturbation theory , the trajectories should fulfill the newton equation of the form [ cf . , eq .  ] , @xmath330 with a suitable initial conditions .",
    "the effective potential @xmath331 , contrary to the classical one @xmath329 , is not singular at the origin for non - zero time and is smeared out by the ` _ _ quantum diffusion _ _ ' represented by the laplacian and the non - linear term in eqs .   or . in other words",
    ", it accounts for the spreading of the electron wave packet during the quantum time evolution .",
    "the laplacian introduces the planck constant into the definition of the effective potential in the first order eikonal perturbation theory . in other words",
    ", @xmath331 differs from @xmath329 by quantum corrections which vanish in the limit @xmath96 .",
    "this also means that @xmath328 does contain quantum corrections and , therefore , we should rather call those trajectories ` _ _ complex - time quantum trajectories _ _ ' .",
    "the effects related to the quantum corrections in @xmath328 are now under investigations .",
    "we have formulated the gea for ionization processes driven by strong laser pulses . as we have shown",
    ", the born approximation arises as the limiting case of our approach .",
    "the ea does not have this property , which significantly diminishes its applicability to the rescattering phenomena . moreover , the ea is singular for the trajectories that come back to the center of atomic potential .",
    "we have demonstrated that the gea does not have this shortcoming either .",
    "this makes it a very promising tool to study rescattering - related phenomena , with the most prominent example of high - order harmonic generation .    using the gea we have discussed the appearance of coherent diffraction patterns in photoelectron energy spectra and their modifications induced by the interaction of photoelectrons with the parent ion .",
    "we have identified the conditions necessary to obtain such coherent patterns . if a pulse consists of at least two modulations , each of these modulations acts as a slit in the young - type experiment for matter waves resulting in a coherent enhancement of ionization signal at particular electron energies .",
    "as we have illustrated this numerically , if we increase the number of modulations within a pulse , the comb - like structures in the energy spectrum of photoelectrons become similar to the @xmath332-like structures .",
