    "the predicted rate of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) in our galaxy is @xmath0 per century ; the rate is about twice the galactic rate out to the andromeda galaxy ( @xmath1  mpc ) , and about one per year out to the virgo cluster ( @xmath2  mpc ) @xcite .",
    "these numbers are accompanied by large uncertainties inherent in converting galaxy properties to supernova rates .",
    "however , @xcite also suggests that the increased number of nearby core - collapse supernovae discovered within the past few years strongly indicates that the predicted rates might be significantly underestimated by a factor of @xmath3 in the @xmath4  mpc range . a direct upper limit on the galactic sne rate , based on non - observations of antineutrino events in the past 25 years , is given in @xcite .",
    "contemporary neutrino detectors and kilometer - scale gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors are currently poised to detect the next galactic core - collapse supernova . both neutrino and gravitational - wave signals",
    "are expected to be generated in the innermost region of a dying star , and both signals are expected to be emitted within a short time interval of each other , i.e. within a few milliseconds @xcite .",
    "while both neutrino and gw detectors are preparing to independently detect a galactic supernova , there are science benefits to systematically searching for a supernova signature using a joint analysis of neutrino and gw data which is guided by the expected proximity of the neutrino and gw signals .",
    "these science benefits include lower detection threshold requirements , better live - time coverage , increased significance of candidate detections , extended distance reach to the local volume of galaxies , and increased sensitivity to core - collapse events which have only a weak or non - existent electromagnetic signature .",
    "the detection of a burst of low - energy neutrinos from sn1987a , at a distance of about 50  kpc in the large magellanic cloud , by the kamiokande ii and irvine - michigan - brookhaven ( imb ) experiments , and by scintillation neutrino detectors @xcite demonstrated the capability of neutrino detectors to detect sn events , and paved the way for a description and validation of the standard model of neutrino emission from a core - collapse supernova . in a core - collapse supernova , @xmath5 of the neutron star s gravitational binding energy ( @xmath6  ergs ) is released in the form of neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) of all flavors .",
    "these neutrinos have energies in the few tens of mev and are emitted over a time scale of a few tens of seconds .",
    "the neutrino light curve is expected to show structure , with an increase in luminosity during the first @xmath7  second due to accretion of matter onto the proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "a neutronization burst , which is a peak in the @xmath8 luminosity produced as the shock from the core bounce propagates through the star s outer core , is expected to last a few milliseconds after the core bounce .",
    "however , the energy emitted in the neutronization burst is only @xmath9 of the total energy emitted , and such a feature might not be easily recognized in a measured neutrino light curve because of its short duration , and because the cross section of @xmath10 scattering is lower than that of the dominant inverse beta decay ( @xmath11 ) reaction in a neutrino detector s medium @xcite .",
    "the events detected by kamiokande ii and imb from sn1987a are reproduced in figure [ fig : sn1987a ] .",
    "the energy of the events detected by kamiokande ii ( closed circles ) and imb ( open circles ) , produced by the neutrino burst from sn1987a , as a function of time , in seconds @xcite.,height=336 ]    the groundbreaking discovery of a neutrino burst from sn1987a was guided by an optical sighting of the supernova @xcite .",
    "the optical sighting of such a close astrophysical event motivated the analysis of archived neutrino data and guided the time scale in which to perform the search .",
    "it is plausible , however , that a fraction of core - collapse events are accompanied only by a faint electromagnetic display .",
    "this might be due to extinction brought about by an extremely dusty environment or the intervening interstellar medium , or an inherently weak accompanying electromagnetic emission with a fast decay time @xcite .",
    "for example , the supernova of cassiopeia  a , one of the youngest known galactic supernova remnants and which is at a relatively close distance of 3.4  kpc , has no historical record of widespread sighting @xcite during the epoch when the explosive fireworks would have reached earth around 340 years ago , and it is plausible that this supernova fell in this category @xcite .",
    "obscuration by dust could also explain the non - sighting of the supernova of an even younger , @xmath12 year - old remnant , g1.9 + 0.3 @xcite .",
    "this would be analogous to how the dearth of known galactic supernova remnants could possibly be attributed to low surface brightness , leaving faint supernova remnants unresolved from the galactic background emission @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that observations suggest a deficit of optically observed high - mass ( @xmath13 ) core - collapse sn progenitors @xcite , and that optical searches have provided little information on the possibility that massive stars end their lives by forming black holes without the dramatic electromagnetic signature of an explosion .",
    "reference @xcite estimates that an upper bound on the rate of so - called  failed \" supernovae is roughly equal to the rate of successful sne , and that the lower bound on black hole formation rate is @xmath14 that of normal sne .    a joint gw - neutrino search for nearby core - collapse supernovae could potentially provide insight to this scenario where a considerable fraction of stars end their lives with little or no electromagnetic display .",
    "indeed , the natural progression of the expected supernova signature  from the prompt gw and neutrino signals to the optical signal which is expected to rise many minutes to hours later  and the current state of neutrino and gravitational - wave detectors and their respective detection algorithms , make it likely that the detection of the next nearby supernova will proceed in a direction opposite that of sn1987a , i.e. that prompt neutrino and gw detections would trigger optical telescopes to search for an optical counterpart .",
    "the infrastracture of the supernova early warning system ( snews ) , for example , is designed to alert observatories in the event of a detection of neutrinos from a nearby supernova @xcite .",
    "simulations also indicate that , for a galactic supernova , the neutrino detectors super - kamiokande and icecube would be able to reconstruct the sn bounce time to within a few milliseconds @xcite . on the gravitational - wave side",
    ", there is also an alert system , called looc up @xcite , which is being developed to send plausible future candidate gw triggers to optical observatories for confirmation of a corresponding astrophysical source .",
    "astrophysical events  such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and flares from soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs)detected by other observatories have been extensively utilized as external triggers in the analysis of ligo - virgo data to search for gw counterparts to these events @xcite .",
    "the strategy of using external triggers with precise event timing and position information to look for gw signals is motivated mainly by the decrease in both background rate and the effective number of experimental trials that shorter analysis time windows make possible . in the case of grbs and sgrs ,",
    "the analysis windows range from a few seconds to a few minutes . on the other hand",
    ", the use of an optical signal from a supernova as an external trigger does not provide the same tight constraints on the time and duration of the analysis window .",
    "studies indicate that , at best , the time of a supernova explosion can be determined from an optical light curve to within a few hours , but only if the first measurement of the optical flux is made within a day of the explosion @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the gravitational - wave and neutrino signals are expected to be detected within a tight window , ranging from a few milliseconds to a few seconds , depending on the dominant gw emission process @xcite .",
    "several of the world s neutrino detectors have performed searches for core - collapse supernovae and have evaluated their respective detection efficiencies as a function of distance .",
    "the super - kamiokande ( super - k ) water cherenkov detector in japan @xcite , the scintillation detectors large volume detector ( lvd ) @xcite and borexino @xcite in italy , and kamland in japan @xcite , icecube at the south pole @xcite , miniboone in the usa @xcite , and others @xcite are expected to robustly detect a neutrino burst from a galactic supernova in the baseline model scenario .",
    "super - k , for example , would detect @xmath15 events for a core - collapse sn at the center of the milky way , @xmath16  kpc away @xcite . the baksan scintillation detector had previously also performed a systematic search @xcite .",
    "analogously , all - sky searches for gw bursts have been performed using data from the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) , the most recent of which made use of data from the fourth ( s4 ) and fifth ( s5 ) ligo science runs @xcite .",
    "while no gravitational waves have been directly detected from an astrophysical source , the current generation of ligo - virgo interferometric gw detectors have made tremendous progress in improving their sensitivities @xcite , and are expected to be sensitive to several models of gw emission from a galactic core - collapse supernova @xcite .",
    "significant improvements in sensitivy are expected to continue with the anticipated advent of the next generation of gw interferometers , advancd ligo and virgo . however , while the astrophysical motivation for expecting gravitational waves to accompany core - collapse supernovae is strong , the expected rate , gravitational - wave strength and waveform morphology are uncertain @xcite . as a benchmark , the expected energy going into gravitational waves may range from @xmath17 to @xmath18  m@xmath19 ( or @xmath20 to @xmath21  ergs ) , and thus only a small fraction of the energy liberated in neutrinos .",
    "estimating the sensitivity improvement of a gravitational - wave search due to a tighter search window and lower background rate requires assumptions on the spectrum of the background events .",
    "in the all - sky gw burst search using the first - year data of ligo s fifth science run , a false alarm rate of 1 in 100 years in the 64 - 200  hz frequency band corresponds to a three - detector network signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) threshold of @xmath22 . for frequencies above 200  hz ,",
    "the corresponding snr threshold is lower , but the interferometers strain sensitivity is lower at this frequency band ( cf .",
    "figure  5 and figure  2 of @xcite , and also appendix  e of @xcite ) . requiring a coincidence of gw events within o(1s ) of a neutrino signal tuned at a rate of 1 per day would allow gw detectors to operate at a false alarm rate of @xmath23hz , which in turn corresponds to a snr threshold of @xmath24  @xcite , or an improvement of a factor of @xmath0 in sensitivity .",
    "the distance reach of gravitational - wave detectors scales linearly with the inverse of snr .",
    "such potential improvement in gravitational - wave sensitivity , in a joint gw - neutrino search , will increase the science reach of the gw instruments relative to what they can achieve alone .    to quantify the science reach ,",
    "it is important to appreciate that the guidance from source phenomenology is subject to significant uncertainties @xcite .",
    "all estimates of gw bursts associated with supernovae rely on models ( see @xcite for recent gw emission estimates ) .",
    "most such models are not yet 3-dimensional , do not incorporate the entire set of possibly relevant physics , and , most importantly , do not ( in most cases ) predict robust supernova explosions as observed in the electromagnetic universe . moreover , none of the current `` state - of - the - art '' simulations can make reliable predictions of the mechanism responsible for the observed velocities of pulsars of up to 1000 km / s ( but see @xcite who do predict such kicks , albeit with a simplified model ) .",
    "it is likely that these velocities were imparted on the neutron stars at birth ( `` pulsar birth kicks '' ) which obviously must involve multi - dimensional dynamics and gravitational - wave emission presently not accounted for in models .",
    "thus , despite the availability of multiple potential explosion mechanisms and their associated multi - dimensional dynamics and gravitational - wave signatures , the current picture is unlikely to be complete .",
    "moreover , the current , most pessimistic estimates are probably overly so in predicting the gravitational - wave yield of core - collapse supernovae . in the absence of complete models , observations can and",
    "must guide our understanding of the astrophysical systems .",
    "joint analysis of neutrino data with initial and enhanced ligo - virgo observations would significantly enhance the capability to constrain models of gravitational - wave emission in core - collapse events .",
    "sensitivity of gravitational - wave detectors to core - collapse supernovae as limited by the efficiency of past , present and foreseen searches .",
    "the diagonal lines in this log - log plot reflect the fundamental relation connecting energy going into gravitational waves , distance to the source , and root - sum - square strain sensitivity of a search , @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "equation  [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "these lines correspond to a fixed search sensitivity _ at _ the gravitational - wave detectors for narrow - band signals in the most sensitive frequency region ( @xmath26  hz ) .",
    "all combinations of energy - distance above and to the left of these diagonal lines can be probed in a search .",
    "the dotted line identified as `` s4 '' corresponds to ligo s fourth science run , and the solid line labelled `` s5 '' to ligo s fifth science run .",
    "the dashed line reflects the estimated improvement in sensitivity in a joint gw - neutrino search .",
    "the dot - dashed line is the expected reach of advanced ligo and virgo , with no assumption of joint searches with neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the horizontal lines represent upper bounds on the energy release for four core collapse models ( as summarized in @xcite ) : a : pns pulsations ( acoustic mechanism , @xcite ) ; b : rotational instability ; c : rotating collapse and bounce ; d : convection and sasi.,width=480 ]    estimated probability of satisfying a super - k neutrino burst search criterion as a function of distance .",
    "solid curve : standard search parameters @xcite .",
    "dashed curve : probability if only a single neutrino event is required , in coincidence with a gw signal.,width=480 ]    for isotropic emission of gravitational waves , the luminosity distance is related to the energy emitted by the source in gw waves , @xmath27 , and to the root - sum - square strain amplitude at the detector , @xmath25 , by @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the observed frequency of the waves . for a hypothetical source at a galactic distance of @xmath30  kpc and an assumed signal morphology of a sine - gaussian waveform @xcite with central frequency @xmath31  hz and",
    "quality factor @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is a dimensionless quantity which is roughly a measure of the width of the waveform in terms of number of cycles of the sinusoid ) , the mass sensitivity during the ligo s5 run is @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the proposed joint search , with a factor of @xmath35 improvement in sensitivity , would decrease by a factor of @xmath36 the minimum energy which is probed in core - collapse supernovae , i.e. down to @xmath37 for a galactic supernova with signal content in the most sensitive band of the gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "searches at higher frequencies would be penalized by the @xmath38 dependence and by lower strain sensitivity of the detectors at these frequencies . at the same time , however , such searches are characterized by a lower accidental background rate @xcite , and the improvement in sensitivity which could be achieved at higher frequencies would be about the same as that which was estimated for searches at the instruments most sensitive frequency , i.e. a factor @xmath0 improvement ( cf .",
    "figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "these scaling laws , and the potential improvement in science reach offered by a joint search , are summarized in figure  [ fig : gwsens ] , together with the expected gravitational - wave emission in four sample emision mechanisms .",
    "a gravitational - wave coincidence requirement also has the potential to improve the sensitivity of neutrino experiments by relaxing the criteria for detection .",
    "for example , super - k s recent `` distant '' burst search @xcite requires two neutrino events ( with energy threshold 17  mev ) within 20 seconds , which corresponds to approximately 8% probability of detecting a supernova in andromeda .",
    "the accidental coincidence rate for this criterion is less than one per year ; the single event rate at this threshold is about 1 per day .",
    "if one could achieve an acceptable accidental rate by requiring coincidence of a single neutrino event with a gravitational - wave signal , then the probability of a core - collapse event in andromeda satisfying the search criterion would be about 35% , as shown in figure  [ fig : nusens ] .",
    "distant burst search parameters could be re - optimized with respect to current ones ; the neutrino event energy threshold could potentially be reduced , further improving sensitivity .",
    "we have motivated the search for nearby core - collapse supernovae using a joint analysis of low - energy neutrino and gravitational - wave data , and we have shown examples of the science benefits of such a joint analysis . turning this idea into a reality in the immediate future using contemporary neutrino and",
    "gravitational - wave data would make possible a richer exploration of the innermost , dynamical processes in a core - collapse supernova .",
    "a search like this is a necessary complement to the joint high - energy neutrino and gravitational - wave search that is currently being planned @xcite .",
    "moreover , embarking on such a task now would be forward - looking , since this kind of analysis would gain importance as the sensitivities of experiments improve .",
    "the advanced ligo and virgo detectors @xcite are expected to start operating in 2014 , and are designed to improve on the sensitivity of the initial detector configurations by a factor of @xmath3910 . at the same time , there are a number of large future neutrino experiments planned , employing various technologies , including some of megaton scale @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite points out that such detectors will be able to observe on the order of one supernova neutrino event every few years from beyond the local group of galaxies ( @xmath0  mpc ) .",
    "in such a regime , some kind of external ( non - neutrino ) trigger will be essential to distinguish supernova neutrino - induced events from background .    c. d. ott is partly supported by the national science foundation under grant number ast-0855535 .",
