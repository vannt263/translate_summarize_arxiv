    "the einstein - cartan theory is the simplest generalization of einstein s general relativity theory , allowing the possibility of relating space - time with torsion .",
    "it reduces to einstein s original theory when the torsion vanishes .",
    "the einstein s general relativity is in agreement with all experimental facts in the domain of macrophysics .",
    "it has been argued , however , in the microscopic level space - time must have a non - vanishing torsion , and so , microscopic gravitational interactions should be described by the einstein - cartan theory @xcite .",
    "it is been also shown that torsion is required for a complete theory of gravitation @xcite .",
    "the spin of matter , as well as its mass plays a dynamical role in einstein - cartan theory .",
    "all the available theoretical evidence that argues for admitting spin and torsion into a gravitational theory is summarized in ref.s @xcite .",
    "the spin - gravity coupling has been paid much attention and appeared in the work of several authors , who have been mainly interested in the study of the matter fields , namely , scalar , gauge , and spinor fields @xcite .    among the most recent papers on the arxiv for einstein - cartan theory",
    ", one can cite the paper by ivanov and wellenzohn @xcite where the torsion field acts as the origin of the cosmological constant or dark energy density .",
    "still another paper treats helicity effects of solar neutrinos using a dynamic torsion field @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that a non - minimally coupled scalar field and gravity generate non - vanishing torsion .",
    "the non - minimally coupled scalar field is of interest for general relativistic gravitational theories , and plays an important role in inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "exact general solutions of the einstein - cartan equations for open friedmann models containing a non - minimally coupled scalar field with an arbitrary coupling constant have been obtained @xcite .",
    "galiakhmetov continued working on this field and wrote several papers where the scalar field coupled to torsion and curvature gave rise to interesting results @xcite .",
    "a very recent paper where non - minimal metric - scalar couplings with curvature and torsion are used is given in @xcite where again dark energy is explained in terms of metric - scalar couplings with torsion .",
    "general relativity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions has become an increasingly popular model in which to understand basic features of the gravitational dynamics @xcite .",
    "the study of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional gravity led to a number of outstanding results , among which the discovery of the baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) black hole was of particular importance @xcite .",
    "einstein gravity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions coupled to a scalar field is studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the interest in einstein - cartan theory of gravity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions has also grown in recent years @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the einstein - cartan gravity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions conformally coupled to a scalar field .",
    "conformally coupling refers to the fact the matter term in the action is invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "we should note that in the framework of einstein - cartan theory , a scalar field non - mimimally coupled to gravity gives rise to torsion , even though the scalar field has zero spin . in this paper , we present the geometrical apparatus necessary for the formulation of the einstein - cartan theory . by variation of the action function with respect to metric and torsion",
    "we obtain the field equations in a general form .",
    "the work organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce notation and definitions used throughout this work .",
    "we set up the total action function of the scalar field with gravitation .",
    "we give explicit form of the klein - gordon equation and einstein - cartan field equations . in section 3",
    "we work out the einstein - cartan field equations which after simplification reduce to the system of first and second order differential equations .",
    "these equations can not be solved analytically . by using the methods of 4th order runge - kutta we give the numerical solutions . from our graphs",
    ", we can conjecture the form of the angular momentum parameter @xmath0 .",
    "for this case we can find the asymptotic form of the scalar field analytically . in section 4",
    "we conclude with some final remarks and perspectives .",
    "the einstein - cartan theory of gravity is the closest theory with torsion to general relativity .",
    "we used the massless scalar field as the source of torsion .",
    "the torsion arises from the scalar field , as just as mass and charge give rise to a field , so does torsion .",
    "the line element ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional space - time is given by @xmath1 in plane polar coordinates @xmath2 .",
