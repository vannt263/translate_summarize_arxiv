    "in the recent years much progress has been made in understanding six and four dimensional orientifold compactifications .",
    "various six dimensional orientifold vacua were constructed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "generalizations of these constructions to four dimensional orientifold vacua have also been discussed in detail in @xcite . in many cases the perturbative world - sheet approach to orientifolds",
    "gives rise to consistent anomaly free vacua in six and four dimensions .",
    "however , as was pointed out in @xcite , there are cases where the perturbative orientifold description is inadequate as it misses certain non - perturbative sectors giving rise to massless states . in certain cases",
    "this inadequacy results in obvious inconsistencies such as lack of tadpole and anomaly cancellation .",
    "examples of such cases were discussed in @xcite . in other cases",
    ", however , the issue is more subtle as the non - perturbative states arise in anomaly free combinations , so that they are easier to miss .",
    "thus , let us consider abelian @xmath1 orbifold compactifications of type i with @xmath0 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "the requirement that the orbifold group @xmath2 act crystallographically on @xmath3 restricts the allowed choices of @xmath2 to @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 , and to @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "here we use star and prime to distinguish different cyclic groups of the same order which act differently on @xmath3 ( the precise actions of these orbifold groups on @xmath3 are given in the subsequent sections ) . in some of the above cases type i - heterotic duality enables one to argue along the lines of @xcite that the non - perturbative states become heavy and decouple once the corresponding orbifold singularities are appropriately blown up .",
    "in particular , these are the @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath8 , @xmath22 and @xmath6 @xcite , and @xmath23 @xcite orbifold cases .",
    "as was argued in @xcite , in other perturbatively tadpole free orientifolds , such as the @xmath7 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite , and @xmath11 @xcite orbifold cases , the non - perturbative open string sectors do give rise to massless states which do not decouple even for blown - up orbifolds .",
    "recently some examples of non - perturbative orientifolds were explicitly constructed in @xcite .",
    "thus , the four dimensional example discussed in @xcite is based on the @xmath7 orbifold .",
    "the purpose of this paper , which is the follow - up of @xcite , is to extend the discussions of @xcite to understand all other orientifold cases as well .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath11 cases .",
    "the first three cases lead to anomaly free non - perturbative orientifolds .",
    "the last case , however , turns out to suffer from a non - perturbative anomaly whose origins we explain in detail in section v. moreover , we elaborate on the rest of the orbifold compactifications mentioned above , namely , the @xmath15 and @xmath27 @xcite , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite cases , which where shown to suffer from perturbative tadpoles in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in @xcite",
    "this was explained by considering f - theory duals of these compactifications . in this paper",
    "we elaborate the arguments of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we point out that the corresponding inconsistencies arise due to the particular choices of the gauge bundle in the models of @xcite ( these gauge bundles are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint ) .",
    "the origin of non - perturbative states in orientifold compactifications can already be understood in six dimensions .",
    "thus , in the k3 orbifold examples of @xcite the orientifold projection is not @xmath28 , which we will use to denote that in the smooth k3 case , but rather @xmath29 , where @xmath30 maps the @xmath31 twisted sector to its conjugate @xmath32 twisted sector ( assuming @xmath33 ) @xcite . geometrically",
    "this can be viewed as a permutation of two @xmath34 s associated with each fixed point of the orbifold @xcite .",
    "( more precisely , these @xmath34 s correspond to the orbifold blow - ups . )",
    "this is different from the orientifold projection in the smooth case where ( after blowing up ) the orientifold projection does _ not _ permute the two @xmath34 s . in the case of the @xmath29 projection",
    "the `` twisted '' open string sectors corresponding to the orientifold elements @xmath35 are absent @xcite .",
    "however , if the orientifold projection is @xmath28 , then the `` twisted '' open string sectors corresponding to the orientifold elements @xmath36 are present @xcite . in fact ,",
    "these states are non - perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint and are required for gravitational anomaly cancellation in six dimensions . in certain cases",
    "type i - heterotic duality allows one to understand such sectors and construct the corresponding models explicitly @xcite .    in four dimensional orientifolds with @xmath0 supersymmetry",
    "there are always sectors ( except in the @xmath14 model of @xcite which is completely perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint ) such that there is only one @xmath34 per fixed point , so only the @xmath28 orientifold projection is allowed .",
    "this results in non - perturbative `` twisted '' open string sectors , which , as we have already mentioned , decouple in certain cases once the appropriate blow - ups are performed . in other cases",
    "we must include these states to obtain the complete description of a given orientifold .",
    "some of the non - perturbative orientifolds have perturbative heterotic duals",
    ". however , non - perturbative orientifolds with , say , d5-branes are non - perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint . in this paper",
    "we are therefore exploring some vacua in the region @xmath37 in fig.1 ( which has been borrowed from the second reference in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 orbifold compactification discussed in @xcite , as well as the @xmath38 orbifold compactification we discuss in section v of this paper , are examples of four dimensional _ chiral _ @xmath0 supersymmetric string vacua which are non - perturbative from both orientifold and heterotic points of view .    the key point which allows us to understand four dimensional non - perturbative orientifolds discussed in this paper is the fact that these models correspond to type i compactifications on generalized voisin - borcea orbifolds of the form @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "one of the simplifying features of these compactifications is that once non - perturbative k3 orientifolds are understood ( and this is partially facilitated by the fact that in six dimensions the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition is rather constraining ) , it is possible to extend the corresponding results to generalized voisin - borcea compactifications .",
    "another nice feature is that , by t - dualizing along @xmath41 , we can map these modes to f - theory compactifications on the corresponding calabi - yau four - folds , and the ( at least partially ) geometric picture arising in the f - theory context is very helpful in understanding such vacua .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we use the map between type i compactifications on k3 and f - theory on voisin - borcea orbifolds to determine which gauge bundles are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint . in section",
    "iii we give explicit models corresponding to k3 compactifications of type i with these perturbative gauge bundles . in section",
    "iv we move down to four dimensions and consider type i compactifications on voisin - borcea orbifolds .",
    "in particular , using the map between such type i vacua and f - theory on calabi - yau four - folds we give the constraints necessary for tadpole cancellation in the cases where the gauge bundle is perturbative . in particular , this discussion relies on the results of section ii . in section",
    "v we discuss type i compactifications on generalized voisin - borcea orbifolds @xmath39 with @xmath42 . in particular , we argue that the @xmath11 case suffers from a non - perturbative anomaly . in section",
    "vi we discuss some directions for extending our results .",
    "in particular , we consider type i on k3 with non - zero ns - ns @xmath43-field and the gauge bundles with vector structure .",
    "in this section we discuss six dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric type i compactifications on k3 .",
    "in particular , what we would like to understand here is which choices of the gauge bundle are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint .",
    "our discussion here applies to both type i and @xmath44 heterotic compactifications on k3 , which is due to type i - heterotic duality .",
    "the dictionary between the two descriptions includes mapping 5-branes on the type i side , which are made of some number of d5-branes , to ns 5-branes ( or , equivalently , small instantons ) on the heterotic side .",
    "thus , consider type i on a k3 surface . in order to determine a particular ground state of the theory",
    ", we must specify not only the compactification space , which in this case is k3 , but also the choice of the gauge bundle .",
    "thus , in the orientifold description of type i non - perturbative effects can arise from two different sources : ( 1 ) the perturbative orientifold description may fail to capture all states arising due to , say , various singularities in k3 itself ; ( 2 ) a given choice of the gauge bundle may not have perturbative orientifold description .",
    "the second source of non - perturbative physics is generally more non - trivial to understand . here",
    ", however , we will be interested in determining which choices of the gauge bundle do possess perturbative orientifold description , and once we understand this class of gauge bundles , we can then focus on the first source of non - perturbative effects which are easier to handle due to various hints from geometry .    the case of k3",
    "is particularly convenient as ( unlike in the case of calabi - yau three - folds ) topologically we are dealing with one surface .",
    "this enables us to understand perturbative gauge bundles in the k3 case by going to orbifold limits which have a simple description .",
    "thus , let us consider orbifold k3 s of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath40 are the choices allowed by the requirement that the orbifold act crystallographically on the four - torus @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 be the complex coordinates parametrizing @xmath46 .",
    "then the action of the generator @xmath31 of @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "next , consider type i on @xmath51 .",
    "we will assume that the ( untwisted ) ns - ns @xmath43-field is trivial .",
    "then we can view type i on @xmath51 as the @xmath28 orientifold of type iib on @xmath51 .",
    "( more precisely , the @xmath28 orientifold is well defined after the appropriate blow - ups of the orbifold singularities other than @xmath52 . )",
    "the theory has @xmath0 supersymmetry in six dimensions .",
    "the massless spectrum of the closed string sector consists of the gravity supermultiplet , one tensor supermultiplet , and 20 hypermultiplets ( which are neutral under the non - abelian gauge symmetries in the open string sector ) . in the open string sector",
    "we have 32 d9-branes , which is required by the untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions . in the @xmath53 case",
    "we do not have any d5-branes . in the @xmath54 cases",
    "tadpole cancellation conditions also require introduction of 32 d5-branes .    to understand the gauge bundles in all of the above cases , recall that in the case of k3 anomaly cancellation requires that the number @xmath55 of instantons embedded in the gauge bundle and the number @xmath56 of 5-branes ( that is , small instantons ) must add up to 24 : @xmath57 . in the @xmath53",
    "all 24 instantons are embedded in the gauge bundle , so the number of 5-branes is zero .",
    "this gauge bundle is therefore perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint . on the orientifold side it is defined by the action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton charges",
    "which is given by the following @xmath58 matrix ( rather than @xmath59 ) chan - paton matrices for we choose not to count the orientifold images of the corresponding d - branes . ]",
    "@xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 denotes the @xmath63 identity matrix .    next , consider the @xmath52 case .",
    "here we have 32 d5-branes which form @xmath64 dynamical 5-branes . here",
    "two pairings take place - one due to the orientifold projection , and the other one due the @xmath52 orbifold projection . we therefore conclude that @xmath65 in this case .",
    "this gauge bundle is non - perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint . on the orientifold side",
    "the corresponding chan - paton matrix is given by @xcite : @xmath66    as to the @xmath67 and @xmath68 cases , the corresponding models are on the same moduli as the @xmath52 model .",
    "indeed , in all three of these cases the gauge group can be higgsed completely .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 cases this can already be done just with the matter arising in the sectors which are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint @xcite .",
    "then the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition implies that after higgsing the number of hypermultiplets in the open string sector is the same in all three models ( the closed string spectra of these models are identical ) , hence they are on the same moduli .",
    "this implies that in the @xmath69 and @xmath68 cases we also have @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the orientifold language",
    "the corresponding chan - paton matrices are given by @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the gauge bundles that are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint have @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is instructive to understand these gauge bundles a bit better . in particular , here we would like to discuss them in the heterotic and f - theory pictures . on the heterotic side there are three topologically distinct gauge bundles with @xmath72 .",
    "these are characterized by the generalized second stiefel - whitney class @xmath74 ( which is an element of @xmath75 , or , more precisely , of @xmath76 as @xmath74 is defined modulo a shift by twice a lattice vector of @xmath75 ) @xcite .",
    "the three distinct gauge bundles correspond to : ( 1 ) @xmath77 ; ( 2 ) @xmath78 ; ( 3 ) @xmath79 . in the first case we have vector structure , while ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are the cases without vector structure .",
    "to understand the above three cases better , it is useful to think about the corresponding gauge bundles in terms of the @xmath52 orbifold action on the @xmath44 degrees of freedom in the heterotic context .",
    "this action can be viewed in terms of a @xmath52 valued shift @xmath80 of the @xmath44 lattice .",
    "let us use the cartan basis of @xmath81 to write @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath82 belongs to the @xmath81 lattice , then we have vector structure , and @xmath77 .",
    "two inequivalent gauge bundles of this type which are perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint are given by @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( here we have chosen the surviving spinor of @xmath44 to be given by @xmath85 modulo @xmath81 shifts ) . in particular , they satisfy the modular invariance constraints such as the level matching condition .",
    "( thus , the gauge bundle given by @xmath83 corresponds to the standard embedding for the @xmath52 orbifold . )",
    "these gauge bundles are non - perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint .    however , we can have @xmath80 such that @xmath82 does not belong to the @xmath81 lattice , albeit it does belong to the @xmath44 lattice .",
    "two inequivalent gauge bundles of this type are given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "note that for such gauge bundles @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , where by @xmath90 we mean the length squared of the 16-vector @xmath82 .",
    "the gauge bundle given by @xmath86 is non - perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint - it does not satisfy the level matching condition .",
    "in fact , this is precisely the gauge bundle in the type iib orientifold of @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this gauge bundle corresponds to embedding 16 instantons accompanied by 8 5-branes to cancel the anomalies . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge bundle @xmath87 is perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint - it satisfies the level matching requirement , and corresponds to embedding all 24 instantons .",
    "it is , however , non - perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint .",
    "finally , let us discuss the f - theory duals of the above cases .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in the @xmath77 case the dual f - theory compactification is on the calabi - yau three - fold given by the @xmath41 fibration over the base @xmath92 .",
    "( here @xmath93 are hirzebruch surfaces . ) in the case of the @xmath53 orbifold this can be seen in two ways .",
    "first , we can higgs the @xmath94 gauge group at the orbifold point ( see table i ) down to @xmath95 with 10 adjoint hypermultiplets in the first @xmath96 and no matter in the second @xmath96 .",
    "this is precisely the spectrum of the f - theory dual on the calabi - yau three - fold with the base @xmath92 ( at the voisin - borcea orbifold point - see section iv ) .",
    "on the other hand , we can explicitly construct the @xmath95 point in the string language .",
    "let k3 be @xmath97 , where",
    "@xmath53 simultaneously rotates the two @xmath41 s by @xmath98 .",
    "then consider the following choice of the gauge bundle .",
    "first , let us turn on a @xmath52 valued wilson line on the @xmath99-cycle of , say , the first @xmath41 such that it breaks @xmath81 down to @xmath100 .",
    "next , let us turn on the second @xmath52 valued wilson line on the @xmath101-cycle of the same @xmath41 such that it further breaks @xmath100 down to @xmath102 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this theory has @xmath53 symmetry under which , say , the first three @xmath96 s are cyclically permuted .",
    "in fact , since the @xmath41 s are hexagonal , under the @xmath53 rotation the @xmath99-cycles maps to the @xmath101-cycle , and so the first wilson line maps to the second wilson line .",
    "the choice of the gauge bundle corresponding to the @xmath53 orbifold then precisely consists of the twist permuting the first three @xmath96 s , while leaving the last @xmath96 untouched .",
    "the resulting model has @xmath103 gauge group , where the subscript indicates the current algebra level via which the corresponding subgroup is realized .",
    "the untwisted sector contains the gravity supermultiplet , one tensor supermultiplet , 2 neutral hypermultiplets , and one hypermultiplet in the adjoint of @xmath104 .",
    "the twisted sector contains 18 neutral hypermultiplets ( corresponding to the blow - up modes of the orbifold ) , and 9 hypermultiplets in the adjoint of @xmath104 .",
    "this spectrum precisely matches that of the f - theory dual corresponding to the base @xmath92 .    as to the cases with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the corresponding dual f - theory compactifications are on calabi - yau three - folds given by @xmath41 fibrations over @xmath105 respectively @xmath106 @xcite . here",
    "we note that these cases also correspond to voisin - borcea orbifolds , but at the latter points in the respective moduli spaces the corresponding bases are singular leading to additional matter @xcite precisely such that the resulting massless spectra match those of the heterotic / type i duals .",
    "also , as was pointed out in @xcite , in the @xmath78 case one can also view the dual f - theory compactification as on a singular calabi - yau three - fold ( with hodge numbers @xmath107 ) given by the `` non - geometric '' @xmath14 orbifold of @xmath108 with discrete torsion @xcite .",
    "this f - theory compactification is in turn on the same moduli as that on a smooth calabi - yau three - fold ( with hodge numbers @xmath109 ) given by the @xmath41 fibration over the base @xmath110 ( that is , the smooth @xmath105 surface ) @xcite .    to summarize , the gauge bundles which are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint are those with @xmath72 , @xmath77 ( this is the case for the gauge bundle in the @xmath53 case ( [ z_3 ] ) ) , and @xmath73 , @xmath78 ( this is the case for the gauge bundles in the @xmath52 ( [ z_2 ] ) , @xmath67 ( [ z_4 ] ) , and @xmath68 ( [ z_6 ] ) cases ) .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the gauge bundles in k3 compactifications of type i which are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint . in this section",
    "we would like to discuss the explicit type i vacua arising upon compactifications on k3 with these gauge bundles .",
    "these compactifications can be viewed as the @xmath28 orientifolds of type iib on ( the corresponding orbifold limits of ) k3 .",
    "thus , the @xmath52 case with the gauge bundle given by ( [ z_2 ] ) ( the action of the orbifold group on both d9- and d5-branes is the same ) was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this model is completely perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint .",
    "thus , the `` @xmath28-twisted '' sector of the orientifold can be viewed as the usual ( `` untwisted '' ) 99 and 55 open string sectors . the `` @xmath36-twisted '' sector ( with @xmath111 in this case )",
    "can be viewed as the usual ( `` untwisted '' ) 59 open string sector .",
    "these sectors are perturbative from the orientifold point of view .",
    "the massless open spectrum of this model is given in table i.    in the @xmath53 case we do have non - perturbative sectors , however .",
    "thus , the `` @xmath28-twisted '' sector of the orientifold corresponds to the untwisted 99 open string sector ( there are no d5-branes in this case ) .",
    "the `` @xmath36- and @xmath112-twisted '' sectors ( with @xmath113 in this case ) correspond to the @xmath53 `` twisted '' 99 open string sector .",
    "this model has a perturbative heterotic dual which enables one to obtain its massless spectrum @xcite , and the latter is given charges . in the untwisted open string sectors",
    "they are straightforward to determine from the standard chan - paton charge assignments . in the twisted open string sectors , however , these @xmath114 charges are generically fractional ( in the normalization where the fundamental of @xmath115 in the untwisted open string sectors has the @xmath114 charge @xmath116 ) . in certain cases",
    "one can determine these charges using type i - heterotic duality ( as on the heterotic side these charges can be computed perturbatively in the corresponding twisted sectors ) .",
    "in other cases determining the twisted sector @xmath114 charges can be more involved .",
    "also , some of the twisted closed string states can transform non - trivially under gauge transformations of some of the @xmath114 s .",
    "the corresponding @xmath114 charges ( in the appropriate basis ) can therefore be non - zero ( and sometimes even fractional ) . ] in table i.    in the @xmath68 case we do not have a perturbative heterotic dual as the type i model contains d5-branes .",
    "nonetheless , it is still possible to determine the spectrum of the model .",
    "thus , the @xmath53 twisted 99 open string sector is the same as in the @xmath53 model with the projection onto the @xmath52 invariant states ( note that @xmath117 ) .",
    "in particular , the 9 fixed points in the original @xmath53 twisted sector are combined into 5 linear combinations invariant under @xmath52 plus 4 linear combinations which pick up a minus sign under the @xmath52 action . taking this into account",
    ", it is straightforward to determine the @xmath52 invariant states in the @xmath53 twisted 99 open string sector ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the @xmath53 twisted 55 open string sector is a bit more subtle - here we assume that all d5-branes are sitting on top of each other at the orientifold 5-plane located at the origin of k3 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "this implies that the d5-branes only feel the singularity in k3 located at the origin .",
    "that is , the other 8 of the original 9 fixed points in the @xmath53 twisted sector play no role in this discussion as the twisted 55 states arise due to the _ local _ geometry near the origin .",
    "this results in the fact that the corresponding multiplicity in the @xmath53 twisted 55 open string sectors is 1 .",
    "finally , the `` @xmath36- and @xmath119-twisted '' sectors ( with @xmath120 in this case ) correspond to the @xmath53 twisted 59 open string sector . in this case local geometry",
    "once again determines the multiplicity of states to be 1 ( and also fixes their quantum numbers ) @xcite .",
    "the massless spectrum of the @xmath68 model is summarized in table i. note that the twisted 99 and 55 open string sectors no longer exhibit the naive `` t - duality '' .",
    "this is due to the fact that these sectors do not arise via a straightforward orbifold reduction of the corresponding ( @xmath81 ) gauge theory ( with @xmath121 supersymmetry in six dimensions ) .",
    "more concretely , the t - duality transformation involves @xmath52 reflection of the complex coordinates @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath53 singularities , however , are _ not _ invariant under this @xmath52 action , hence the lack of t - duality symmetry .",
    "finally , let us consider the @xmath67 case which was not discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty in this case is that ( unlike in the @xmath53 and @xmath68 cases ) this model has no perturbative heterotic dual , nor do we have any sectors of the theory which can be understood by performing a perturbative computation on the heterotic side .",
    "fortunately , however , anomaly cancellation requirements ( which are quite constraining in six dimensions ) along with the relevant geometric picture allow us to determine the massless spectrum in this case as well .",
    "thus , the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition reads : @xmath122 where @xmath123 are the numbers of hypermultiplets , vector multiplets and tensor multiplets , respectively . in this case",
    "we have @xmath124 tensor multiplets and @xmath125 hypermultiplets from the closed string sector .",
    "all the vector multiplets arise in the open string sector . in particular , @xmath126 as the gauge group is @xmath127_{99}\\otimes [ u(8)\\otimes u(8)]_{55}$ ] .",
    "the anomaly cancellation condition ( [ anom ] ) then implies that the total number of open string hypermultiplets must be : @xmath128 .",
    "the perturbative sectors , namely , the untwisted 99 plus 55 as well as 59 sectors give rise to 368 hypermultiplets in this model ( see table i ) .",
    "thus , @xmath129 hypermultiplets must come from the twisted open string sectors .",
    "these are the @xmath67 twisted 99 and 55 open string sectors corresponding to the `` @xmath36- and @xmath130-twisted '' sectors ( with @xmath131 in this case ) .",
    "note that there is no `` twisted '' 59 sector in this model .    from the anomaly cancellation",
    "we get a hint that the twisted 99 and 55 open string sector hypermultiplets must transform in the antisymmetric representation @xmath132 of the @xmath133 subgroups .",
    "in fact , since the two @xmath133 s within , say , the 55 open string sector are on the equal footing , we conclude that the only way we can cancel anomalies is by assuming that in the twisted 55 sector we have one copy of twisted hypermultiplets in @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and similarly for the twisted 99 sector . in the 55 sector",
    "this is actually what one expects from the geometric picture : just as in the @xmath68 case here we have all d5-branes on top of each other at the orientifold 5-plane located at the origin of k3 , so we expect only _ one _ copy of non - perturbative twisted hypermultiplets arising due to the local geometry at the vicinity of the origin ( the latter being the relevant singularity in k3 ) .",
    "however , for the 99 sector the conclusion that we have only one copy of twisted hypermultiplets might appear a bit puzzling - the d9-branes wrap the entire k3 , and naively one expects that they should `` feel '' all 4 @xmath67 fixed points .",
    "let us try to understand this point a bit better .",
    "an important observation here is that the naive t - duality _ is _ expected to be a symmetry of this background - indeed , the @xmath52 reflection of the complex coordinates @xmath47 involved in the t - duality transformation leaves the corresponding @xmath67 singularities invariant .",
    "thus , the @xmath67 twisted 55 and 99 open string sectors should have t - duality symmetry .",
    "then we must explain how come in the 99 sector we do not get 4 copies of the corresponding matter representations but only one .",
    "the point here is that we expect massless non - perturbative states to arise only for true geometric singularities . however ,",
    "if there is a non - zero twisted @xmath43-field turned on inside of the @xmath34 associated with a given blow - up mode ( that is , with a given fixed point ) , then non - perturbative states do not arise @xcite .",
    "since we are dealing with the @xmath67 twisted sectors , the corresponding twisted @xmath43-field can only take values @xmath136 ( here we normalize the @xmath43-field so that it is defined modulo a unit shift ) .",
    "the @xmath43-filed must be zero at the origin . at the other three fixed points , however",
    ", it must be non - zero .",
    "note that it can not be @xmath137 as this would not be invariant under the orientifold action @xmath28 ( recall that the @xmath43-field is odd under the action of @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath43-field at these three fixed points can take a half - integer value which ( taking into account that it is only defined modulo an integer shift ) is invariant under the action of @xmath28 . thus , to obtain a consistent @xmath67 orbifold background ( with all d5-branes located at the origin of k3 ) , we must turn on half - integer twisted @xmath43-field at the other three fixed points .",
    "then the massless spectrum of the @xmath67 model , which is summarized in table i , is free of anomalies .",
    "here we should note that in the @xmath53 and @xmath68 models the twisted @xmath43-field ( in the @xmath53 twisted sectors ) must be zero as non - zero values such as @xmath138 would not be invariant under the action of @xmath28 .",
    "this is why in these models all singularities ( that is , fixed points ) are relevant in the twisted 99 sector .    here",

    "we discussed perturbative ( from the orientifold viewpoint ) gauge bundles for k3 compactifications in section ii .",
    "our goal here will be to determine which gauge bundles are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint for the voisin - borcea compactifications .",
    "it turns out that one can answer this question using the map between type iib orientifolds and f - theory .",
    "in fact , as we will see in a moment , the requirement that the gauge bundle be perturbative greatly restricts the possible choices of the compactification space itself .",
    "thus , consider type i compactification on the voisin - borcea orbifold @xmath158 labeled by @xmath201 .",
    "we can view this as the @xmath28 orientifold of type iib on @xmath158 .",
    "this theory contains 32 d9-branes as well as d5-branes .",
    "thus , there are d5-branes filling @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the non - compact four dimensional minkowski space - time , whereas @xmath204 is the set of points ( of real dimension 2 ) in @xmath157 fixed under the action of the @xmath52 twist @xmath145 ( see the previous subsection for notations ) .",
    "there may be other 5-branes depending upon the choice of the space @xmath158 .",
    "thus , if the k3 surface @xmath140 ( recall that the base of the elliptic fibration is @xmath205 ) can be written as the quotient @xmath206 ( here @xmath207 can be either @xmath46 or another k3 surface ) , where the generator @xmath208 of @xmath52 reflects both of the complex coordinates @xmath47 on @xmath207 , then we have other 5-branes in the theory .",

    "@xmath214 reflects the complex coordinate @xmath147 on the fibre @xmath41 ( while acting trivially on the base @xmath157 ) , and @xmath215 is the left - moving ( space - time ) fermion number .",
    "this orientifold can now be mapped to the f - theory compactification on an elliptically fibered calabi - yau four - fold via the map of @xcite which we review next .",

    "then following @xcite we can map this orientifold to ( a limit of ) f - theory on a calabi - yau four - fold @xmath218 defined as @xmath219 where @xmath220 , and @xmath221 acts as @xmath222 on @xmath223 ( @xmath224 is a complex coordinate on @xmath223 ) , and as @xmath214 on @xmath158 . to avoid confusion ,",
    "here we use tilde to distinguish between the fibre @xmath223 in the elliptic fibration over the base @xmath225 , where @xmath226 , and the fibre @xmath41 in the elliptic fibration over the base @xmath227 .",
    "note that in the case where @xmath158 is a voisin - borcea orbifold , the above four - fold @xmath218 can be viewed as a quotient @xmath228 . here",
    "@xmath229 ( recall that @xmath220 , and @xmath221 acts as @xmath230 and @xmath231 on the complex coordinates parametrizing @xmath223 and @xmath41 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , @xmath232 is ( the @xmath52 orbifold limit of ) a k3 surface . the action of @xmath233 on the two k3 surfaces @xmath234 and @xmath140 is given by the corresponding nikulin s involutions labeled by the integers @xmath235 and @xmath151 respectively .",
    "( in fact , it is not difficult to show that in the present case @xmath236 and @xmath237 . )",
    "these calabi - yau four - folds ( which have @xmath238 holonomy ) generically are singular spaces .",
    "the euler number @xmath239 of such a four - fold is given by @xcite : @xmath240 taking into account that in the case at hand we have @xmath236 , we obtain @xmath241 now consider f - theory compactification on such a four - fold . to cancel space - time anomaly",
    "we need to introduce @xmath242 3-branes , which implies that this number must be non - negative or else supersymmetry appears to be broken @xcite .",
    "it then follows that @xmath243 this is a non - trivial constraint with interesting implications for type i model building .",
    "for instance , if we take type i on a @xmath244 orbifold of @xmath108 with discrete torsion , the hodge numbers are @xmath107 ( note that this is the mirror calabi - yau of a usual @xmath14 orbifold without discrete torsion whose hodge numbers are @xmath245 ) , and we have @xmath197 and @xmath246 .",
    "thus , type i compactification on this space is always anomalous ( that is , there is no choice of the gauge bundle consistent with tadpole cancellation ) .",
    "thus , let us consider type i compactifications with @xmath247 . in the dual f - theory picture",
    "the number of 3-branes required for anomaly cancellation is @xmath248 .",
    "if this number is non - zero , we have a choice of where to place these 3-branes : ( _ i _ ) we can keep them in the bulk ; from the type i point of view these correspond to dynamical 5-branes ( made of some number of d5-branes ) ; ( _ ii _ ) alternatively , we can `` dissolve '' them into the 7-branes ; from the type i viewpoint this corresponds to embedding a certain @xmath44 gauge bundle .",
    "the corresponding instantons are no longer point - like ( at generic points ) .",
    "thus , we see that we need to specify additional data , which is the choice of the gauge bundle .",
    "what we are interested in understanding here is which choices are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint .    to answer this question recall that in k3 compactifications the total number of instantons must be 24 . by these we actually mean the number @xmath55 of instantons embedded in the gauge bundle plus the number @xmath56 of 5-branes transverse to k3 . in the case of the voisin - borcea compactifications this number 24",
    "is reduced to 12 - the corresponding pairing takes place due to the additional @xmath52 projection by the orbifold group @xmath249 .",
    "thus , @xmath242 must be at least 12 .",
    "this implies that the statement ( [ state ] ) can be made even stronger : @xmath250 in fact , since we have a @xmath52 twist generated by @xmath145 , we must include 32 d5-branes ( filling @xmath202 - see above ) .",
    "these correspond to 8 dynamical 5-branes : here two pairings take place - one due to the @xmath28 orientifold projection , and the other one due to the @xmath251 orbifold projection .",
    "note that here we are making an assumption that the corresponding background is perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint - it is _ a priori _ not obvious at all that in other cases we must include d5-branes .",
    "in fact , here we can give an example where this is _ not _ the case .",
    "thus , consider @xmath44 heterotic on @xmath91 with the standard embedding of the gauge bundle ( which we discussed in section ii ) .",
    "this theory is perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint , hence no 5-branes are present .",
    "that is , no d5-branes would be present on the dual type i side either .",
    "this compactification , however , is _ non - perturbative _ from the orientifold viewpoint .",
    "thus , we must have at least 20 3-branes ( 12 from k3 , and 8 from the d5-branes filling @xmath202 ) .",
    "this implies that , for the gauge bundle to be perturbative , we must have @xmath252 .",
    "in fact we will now show that there are only two choices of @xmath152 for which we can have perturbative gauge bundle : @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "first , suppose @xmath255 .",
    "then we must have additional 5-branes whose number is @xmath256 .",
    "however , the only other way we can obtain 5-branes perturbatively in the orientifold language is to have 8 dynamical 5-branes ( arising from 32 d5-branes ) filling @xmath257 ( these are perpendicular to those filling @xmath202 ) .",
    "this then implies that we must have @xmath254 . on the other hand , if @xmath253 we must make sure that there are no 5-branes filling @xmath257 .",
    "this implies that in this case the k3 surface @xmath140 _ can not _ be written as the quotient @xmath258 .",
    "it then follows that there are _ no _ 5-branes transverse to k3 ( that is , @xmath140 ) either ( that is , @xmath259 and @xmath260 in the corresponding k3 compactification ) .",
    "the above discussion shows that the gauge bundle can be perturbative if and only if @xmath253 or @xmath254 .",
    "let us apply these constraints to the cases where the k3 surface @xmath140 is a toroidal orbifold , that is , @xmath261 with @xmath40 . in the @xmath262 case ( without discrete torsion between @xmath145 and the generator @xmath31 of the k3 orbifold group ) the hodge numbers of the corresponding voisin - borcea orbifold are @xmath245 , and @xmath254 , @xmath246 .",
    "we then arrive at a consistent type i compactification on the @xmath14 orbifold discussed in @xcite . in the @xmath263 case",
    "the hodge numbers are @xmath264 , and we arrive at the non - perturbative orientifold corresponding to type on @xmath7 orbifold recently constructed in @xcite . for later convenience",
    "we give the massless spectrum of this model in table ii .",
    "next , consider the @xmath265 case .",
    "suppose there is no discrete torsion between @xmath145 and @xmath266 ( where @xmath31 is the generator of the k3 orbifold group ) .",
    "then the hodge numbers are @xmath267 , and , therefore , @xmath268 and @xmath193 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we include discrete torsion between @xmath145 and @xmath266 , we obtain @xmath107 just as in the @xmath14 case with discrete torsion .",
    "thus , in type on the @xmath15 orbifold we can not cancel tadpoles if we choose the perturbative gauge bundle .",
    "( in fact , in the case with discrete torsion it is impossible to cancel tadpoles for any choice of the gauge bundle . in the case without discrete torsion tadpole cancellation might be possible at the expense of choosing a gauge bundle which is non - perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint . )",
    "this explains why the naive perturbative tadpole cancellation conditions were found in @xcite to have no solution . here",
    "the map to f - theory provides a simple geometric interpretation of this fact .",
    "the above conclusion about perturbative inconsistency of type i on @xmath15 can be used to understand other similar models .",
    "note that the sectors of the orientifold labeled by @xmath28 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 are perturbatively well defined ( as the corresponding k3 orientifolds are well defined ) .",
    "this implies that the `` troublesome '' sectors are the @xmath273 and @xmath274 sectors .",
    "this is precisely the conclusion that was reached in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath275 is the generator of an orbifold group @xmath67 , which , to avoid confusion , we will refer to as @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , @xmath276 is a calabi - yau three - fold with @xmath148 holonomy .",
    "thus , we conclude that type i on the @xmath5 orbifold is not consistent for perturbative gauge bundles .",
    "in fact , we can further deduce that perturbative gauge bundles would lead to inconsistencies in the @xmath20 , @xmath9 and @xmath12 orbifold models as well since all of these orbifold groups contain @xmath5 as a subgroup .",
    "this is in accord with the discussion in @xcite , where it was also argued why in the @xmath10 model choosing the perturbative gauge bundle leads to similar inconsistencies as well .",
    "thus , the discussion in @xcite explains the results of @xcite ( where it was shown that the naive perturbative tadpole cancellation conditions in the @xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 cases have no solution ) using the geometric picture via the map to f - theory . here",
    "the @xmath15 example serves as an illustration of the discussion in @xcite .",
    "finally , let us discuss the case @xmath277 ( without discrete torsion between @xmath145 and @xmath278 , where @xmath31 is the generator of the k3 orbifold group ) .",
    "the hodge numbers in this case are @xmath245 just as in the @xmath14 case without discrete torsion .",
    "this implies that @xmath254 and @xmath246 .",
    "this compactification , therefore , should be consistent for the appropriate perturbative gauge bundle .",
    "we will explicitly construct this model ( via the corresponding non - perturbative orientifold ) in the next subsection .      in this subsection",
    "we are going to give the massless spectrum of the non - perturbative orientifold based on the @xmath16 orbifold compactification of type i theory .",
    "this background has @xmath0 supersymmetry in four dimensions . here",
    "we should emphasize that the choice of the gauge bundle in the model we discuss in this subsection is _ perturbative _ from the orientifold viewpoint .",
    "the non - perturbative sectors arise due to singularities in the calabi - yau itself as discussed in introduction .",
    "that is , non - perturbative states in this theory arise along the lines of our discussion in section iii for k3 compactifications of type i.    thus , consider type i on the voisin - borcea orbifold @xmath279 , where the generators @xmath280 and @xmath31 of @xmath52 respectively @xmath68 have the following action on the complex coordinates @xmath281 parametrizing the three two - tori : @xmath282 where @xmath283 , @xmath284 , @xmath285 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the calabi - yau three - fold @xmath158 ( which has @xmath148 holonomy ) has the hodge numbers @xmath286 , so that there are @xmath287 chiral supermultiplets in the closed string sector .",
    "in the open string sector we have 32 d9-branes , and also three sets of d5-branes with 32 d5-branes in each set .",
    "thus , the world - volumes of the d@xmath288-branes are four non - compact space - time dimensions plus the two - torus parametrized by the complex coordinate @xmath289 . for the sake of definiteness , in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the brane configuration where all d@xmath288-branes are placed on top of each other at the orientifold @xmath288-plane located at the origin in the transverse dimensions ( that is , @xmath290 , @xmath291 ) .",
    "up to equivalent representations the chan - paton matrices are given by : @xmath292 here @xmath293 , and @xmath294 are the usual @xmath295 pauli matrices .",
    "( the action on the d@xmath288-branes is similar . )",
    "the perturbative ( from the orientifold viewpoint ) massless open string spectrum of this model can be obtained using the standard orientifold techniques , and is given in table iii .",
    "thus , the @xmath28-twisted sector corresponds to the untwisted 99 plus @xmath296 open string sectors , while @xmath297 twisted sector corresponds to the untwisted @xmath298 plus @xmath299 ( @xmath300 ) open string sectors .",
    "the non - perturbative sectors in this orientifold are the following .",
    "the @xmath301- and @xmath302-twisted sectors correspond to the twisted 99 plus @xmath296 open string sectors , while the @xmath303- and @xmath304-twisted sectors correspond to the twisted @xmath298 plus @xmath299 ( @xmath300 ) open string sectors .",
    "the twisted @xmath305 and @xmath306 sectors are straightforward to work out starting from the twisted 95 sector in the six dimensional @xmath68 model in table i respectively the twisted 95 sector in the four dimensional @xmath7 model in table ii and projecting onto the corresponding @xmath52 invariant states .",

    "the twisted @xmath308 sectors are the same as the twisted @xmath309 sectors except that the multiplicity of the states in the latter is 1 , while it is 3 in the former .",

    "( this is in complete parallel with the corresponding discussion for the six dimensional cases in @xcite and section iii . ) as to the twisted @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath312 sectors , they can be worked out by starting from the twisted 99 and 55 sectors in the @xmath7 model in table ii and projecting onto the corresponding @xmath52 invariant states .",
    "similarly , the twisted @xmath313 sector ( as well as the twisted 99 sector ) can be worked out by starting from the twisted 55 sector in the @xmath68 model in table i and projecting onto the corresponding @xmath52 invariant states .",
    "the complete massless spectrum of the @xmath16 model including both perturbative and non - perturbative ( from the orientifold viewpoint ) states is given in table iii .",
    "note that all non - abelian gauge anomalies cancel in this model .",
    "in the previous section we considered type i compactifications on voisin - borcea orbifolds of the form @xmath314 .",

    "@xmath319 , and @xmath320 is the holomorphic two - form on @xmath140 .",
    "note that the holomorphic three - form @xmath321 on @xmath158 is invariant under the action of @xmath316 , which implies that @xmath158 is a calabi - yau three - fold with @xmath148 holonomy ( which is actually elliptically fibered over the base @xmath322 ) provided that the action of the orbifold group @xmath48 is a symmetry of @xmath323 .",
    "the latter requirement implies that @xmath324 is restricted to the values @xmath40 so that the action of @xmath48 on @xmath41 is crystallographic .",
    "note that in the @xmath262 case we have voisin - borcea orbifolds discussed in the previous section . in this section",
    "we will be interested in the cases @xmath42 .",
    "let us start with the @xmath265 case .",
    "suppose @xmath140 is an orbifold k3",
    ". then the three - fold @xmath158 can be either the @xmath325 or @xmath20 orbifold of @xmath326 .",
    "we have already discussed these cases in the previous section where we saw that for perturbative gauge bundles tadpoles can not be canceled in these models .",
    "next , let us consider the @xmath277 case with @xmath140 an orbifold k3",
    ". then @xmath158 can be the @xmath327 , @xmath328 , @xmath329 or @xmath330 orbifold of @xmath326 .",
    "the first case was explicitly constructed in the previous section .",
    "we will discuss the last case , which was explicitly constructed in @xcite , in a moment .",
    "the other two cases are straightforward to work out : the perturbative part of the spectrum is obtained using the standard orientifold techniques @xcite , whereas the non - perturbative twisted open string sector states can be easily worked out by starting with the corresponding twisted states in the @xmath68 model in table i , the @xmath7 model in table ii , and the @xmath16 model in table iii , and performing the appropriate ( @xmath52 and/or @xmath53 ) orbifold projections . here",
    "the following remark is in order .",
    "note that in the @xmath331 and @xmath329 models _ a priori _ there are two types of twisted open string sectors .",
    "first , we have open string sectors corresponding to the orientifold group elements labeled by @xmath332 , where @xmath333 is an orbifold group element such that for some choice of @xmath334 the set of points ( in @xmath335 ) fixed under @xmath336 is of real dimension 2 .",
    "these are precisely the twisted open string sectors which can be deduced via the appropriate orbifold projections of the `` parent '' models mentioned above .",
    "this is due to the fact that such twisted open string sectors are either projections of those in the corresponding @xmath337 compactifications , or of twisted 59 open string sectors which can be read off by appropriately projecting that in the @xmath7 model in table ii .",
    "the second type of twisted open string sectors correspond to the orientifold group elements labeled by @xmath338 such that for some choice of @xmath334 the set of points fixed under @xmath336 is zero dimensional .",
    "such twisted open string sectors were argued in @xcite to give rise to states that become heavy and decouple upon appropriately blowing up the corresponding singularities in the compactification space @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail shortly . here , however , an important observation is that the second type of twisted open string sectors do not give rise to massless states once we consider _ blown - up _ orbifolds .    for the sake of brevity here we will not give the spectra of the @xmath331 and @xmath329 models .",
    "let us mention , however , that the gauge groups in these two cases are @xmath339_{99}\\otimes [ u(2)^6\\otimes u(4)]_{55}$ ] respectively @xmath340_{99}\\otimes \\bigotimes_{i=1}^3   [ u(2)^3\\otimes sp(4)]_{5_i5_i}$ ] .",
    "thus , the @xmath329 model is non - chiral if we ignore the @xmath114 charges .",
    "the @xmath331 model is chiral as in the perturbative open string sectors there are states transforming under @xmath341 and @xmath342 of the @xmath238 subgroups .",
    "however , the twisted open string sector states are not charged under the @xmath238 subgroups , so that these sectors are automatically free of non - abelian gauge anomalies .",
    "these two models , therefore , are not as illuminating as , say , the @xmath16 model in table iii .",
    "let us point out that the @xmath343 model was explicitly constructed in @xcite .",
    "the discussion of twisted open string sectors in this model is completely analogous to that in the @xmath344 case .",
    "let us therefore consider the generalized voisin - borcea orbifolds with @xmath263 ( and the @xmath6 case is a particular example of this type ) .    for @xmath263 we have the following possibilities : @xmath345 , @xmath346 , @xmath22 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the last case we have already considered . the @xmath22 case was explicitly constructed in @xcite . just as in the @xmath331 and @xmath331 cases , here we also have twisted open string sectors of two types . as was shown in @xcite , in this model twisted states of _",
    "both _ types decouple upon appropriately blowing up the orbifold singularities , so that the remaining massless spectrum coincides with that obtained in the perturbative orientifold approach .",
    "this turns out _ not _ to be the case in the @xmath11 model which we will discuss in detail in a moment .",
    "however , some of the sectors in the @xmath11 model are similar to those in the @xmath6 model , which was explicitly constructed in @xcite , so let us discuss the latter in a bit more detail",
    ".    thus , consider type i on the generalized voisin - borcea orbifold @xmath347 , where the action of the generator @xmath31 of @xmath6 on the complex coordinates @xmath281 parametrizing the three two - tori is given by : @xmath348 where @xmath61 . in this case",
    "we have 32 d9-branes and 32 d5-branes , the latter wrapping the first @xmath41 .",
    "the non - perturbative open string sectors correspond to the orientifold group elements labeled by @xmath36 plus @xmath119 and @xmath112 plus @xmath349 .",
    "note that the singularities in the @xmath6 twisted sectors are a subset of singularities in the @xmath4 twisted sectors .",
    "this implies that if the blow - ups in the @xmath4 model lead to the decoupling of non - perturbative open string sector states , the same should hold in the @xmath6 model as well .",
    "the fact that non - perturbative twisted open string sector states indeed decouple in the blown - up @xmath4 model was shown in @xcite using type - i heterotic duality .",
    "thus , in the corresponding @xmath350 model we expect all non - perturbative states to decouple as well .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the @xmath11 model . the generator @xmath31 of @xmath351 has the following action on the three complex coordinates in the compact directions : @xmath352 note that @xmath353 .",
    "the corresponding calabi - yau four - fold has the hodge numbers @xmath354 , so that the closed string spectrum contains 34 chiral supermultiplets .",
    "here we note that the hodge numbers in the @xmath6 case are also @xmath354 .",
    "that is , in both the @xmath6 and @xmath11 models the compactification space is the same , but the gauge bundles are different .    in the open string sector",
    "we have 32 d9-branes as well as 32 d5-branes ( in the following we will focus on the brane configuration where all d5-branes are sitting on top of each other at the orientifold 5-plane located at @xmath355 ) .",
    "the perturbative open string sector of this model can be obtained using the standard orientifold techniques ( once the action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton factors is specified - see below ) .",
    "the non - perturbative sectors corresponding to the orientifold group elements labeled by @xmath36 plus @xmath356 , @xmath112 plus @xmath357 , @xmath349 plus @xmath358 , and @xmath119 plus @xmath359 do not give rise to massless states ( after the appropriate blow - ups ) for the same reasons as in the @xmath6 case .",
    "however , the @xmath67 twisted open string sectors corresponding to the orientifold group elements labeled by @xmath130 plus @xmath360 do give rise to non - perturbative massless states .",
    "these states can be obtained by starting from the @xmath67 model in table i and projecting onto the @xmath4 invariant states .",
    "there is , however , a subtlety in this projection , so let us discuss the action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton factors in a bit more detail .",
    "the point here is that to have a perturbative ( from the orientifold viewpoint ) gauge bundle , we must make sure that all the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions ( derived in the perturbative orientifold approach ) cancel . in particular , the twisted tadpole cancellation condition for the @xmath11 , @xmath6 , @xmath67 and @xmath52 twisted chan - paton matrices ( for both d9- and d5-branes ) read @xcite : @xmath361 on the other hand , the @xmath4 twisted chan - paton matrices are fixed by the corresponding tadpole cancellation conditions as in the @xmath4 model of @xcite ( see the next subsection for details ) .",
    "the only way to satisfy all of these twisted tadpole cancellation conditions is to consider @xmath59 chan - paton matrices which ( up to equivalent representations ) are given by @xmath362 where @xmath363 , and @xmath71 .",
    "note that the same would not be possible if we considered @xmath58 matrices .",
    "that is , the tadpole cancellation conditions require that both 16 d - branes and their orientifold images participate in canceling the tadpoles at the same time , while separate cancellations of the corresponding tadpoles for the 16 d - branes and their orientifold images can not be achieved .",
    "this , in particular , implies that ( since the 16 d - branes and their orientifold images are mapped to each other by the orientifold projection ) the chan - paton matrix @xmath364 interchanges the twisted chan - paton matrices with their conjugates : @xmath365 .",
    "such an action is perfectly well defined in the six dimensional @xmath29 orientifolds of @xcite as in those cases the orientifold projection @xmath29 maps the @xmath31-twisted sector to its conjugate @xmath32-twisted sector . however , as we have already pointed out in introduction , in four dimensions the orientifold projection is @xmath28 which maps the @xmath31-twisted sector to itself ( here we assume that the appropriate blow - ups have been performed ) .",
    "it is then _ a priori _ far from being obvious whether it is consistent to have @xmath365 while @xmath366 .",
    "in fact , we are going to argue that such an action leads to inconsistencies . here",
    "we should point out that such an inconsistency can not be seen perturbatively in the orientifold picture if we just focus on the gauge ( that is , the open string ) sector of the theory .",
    "indeed , the perturbative open string sector of this model by itself is perfectly sensible ( see below ) .",
    "however , if one couples open and closed strings , then one expects an inconsistency to show up - thus , the twisted closed string sector states ( which couple to the corresponding d - branes ) feel the orientifold projection in a way which is not compatible with the action of the orientifold projection on the chan - paton factors .",
    "that is , the orientifold group actions on the closed and open string degrees of freedom are not compatible .",
    "it is , however , difficult to see this open - closed coupling inconsistency directly as the @xmath28 projection in the closed string sector makes sense only after the appropriate blow - ups have been performed , so we are no longer at the orbifold point in the corresponding calabi - yau moduli space , which makes world - sheet computations rather involved ( and practically useless , at least for our purposes here ) .",
    "there are , however , other ways to see this inconsistency .",
    "first , we can try to understand it using type i - heterotic duality . here",
    "we should emphasize that quantifying the following statements in this context is difficult as the heterotic dual of the @xmath11 model would be non - perturbative - we have 5-branes in this case .",
    "nonetheless , the following somewhat hand - waving argument might still be useful .",
    "thus , on the heterotic side the embedding of the gauge bundle ( that is , of the orbifold action on the gauge degrees of freedom ) can be understood in terms of the appropriate @xmath11 valued @xmath367 lattice shifts .",
    "( these shifts are @xmath11 valued w.r.t . the @xmath367 lattice , but are @xmath368 valued w.r.t . the @xmath81 lattice . ) the @xmath28 projection on the heterotic side can be thought of as pairing 32 real majorana fermions ( in the real fermion representation of the @xmath367 degrees of freedom ) into 16 complex world - sheet fermions .",
    "the @xmath11 valued @xmath367 lattice shifts in this language translate into @xmath369 phase rotations of the complex fermions .",
    "for these rotations to be consistent , we must make sure that they can be written in the complex @xmath58 basis . if this can not be achieved , that is , if we can only do this in the @xmath59 bases , then the model is inconsistent .",
    "in particular , the scattering amplitudes would be inconsistent @xcite . in the following subsection",
    "we will relate this argument to the analogous statement in the dual f - theory picture , where the above inconsistency can be seen in a geometric way .",
    "however , for now let us take the above gauge bundle and discuss the corresponding massless spectrum arising in the @xmath11 model .",
    "as we will see in a moment , the _ non - perturbative _ spectrum turns out to be anomalous .",
    "once the twisted chan - paton matrices are fixed as above , the perturbative ( from the orientifold viewpoint ) states in the @xmath11 model are straightforward to work out . the resulting perturbative massless open string sector is given model was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the untwisted open string spectrum given in table iv , however , differs from that in @xcite .",
    "in particular , note that the spectrum should be invariant under permuting the two @xmath370 subgroups ( accompanied by an appropriate interchange / conjugation of the corresponding @xmath371 subgroups ) in , say , the 99 open string sector , which follows from the action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton factors . this is the case for the spectrum in table iv , but _ not _ for the spectrum given in @xcite . ] in table iv .",
    "note that the non - abelian gauge anomalies cancel in the untwisted open string sector .",
    "next , let us discuss the non - perturbative open string sectors , that is , the @xmath67 twisted open string sectors .",
    "these are straightforward to work out starting from the @xmath67 twisted open string sectors in the @xmath67 model in table i and projecting onto the @xmath4 invariant states .",
    "note that the resulting twisted 99 and 55 open string sectors are apparently t - dual for the same reason as in the @xmath67 model in table i - the @xmath67 fixed points are invariant under the @xmath52 reflections involved in the t - duality transformation ( recall that the other twisted sectors such as @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath11 do not give rise to non - perturbative states once the appropriate blow - ups are performed ) .",
    "in fact , it is important here that the @xmath67 sector fixed point located at the origin contains no twisted @xmath43-field , whereas the other three fixed points have half - integer valued @xmath43-field stuck inside of the corresponding @xmath34 s ( see section iii for details ) . in particular , this configuration possesses the required @xmath53 symmetry .",
    "next , we list the resulting non - perturbative states arising in the @xmath67 twisted open string sectors ( these states are @xmath0 chiral supermultiplets - see table iv for notations ) : @xmath372 where the first four of these states come from the hypermultiplet transforming in @xmath373 , and the last four come from the hypermultiplet transforming in @xmath374 upon @xmath4 projecting the @xmath127_{99/55}$ ] quantum numbers in the @xmath67 model in table i. note that the above twisted spectrum suffers from @xmath375 non - abelian gauge anomalies .",
    "that is , non - perturbatively we see an inconsistency in this model . in the next subsection",
    "we will give additional arguments clarifying the origins of this non - perturbative anomaly using the map between type iib orientifolds and f - theory .",
    "in the previous section we gave the map between type i on voisin - borcea orbifolds and f - theory . in this subsection",
    "we would like to do the same in the case of generalized voisin - borcea orbifolds with @xmath42 .",
    "there is a subtlety in this map ( as was pointed out in @xcite ) in the @xmath376 cases , and here we will give make this map precise .",
    "naively , we can start from @xmath377 , t - dualize along the fibre @xmath41 , and map the resulting model to f - theory via @xcite to arrive at the f - theory compactification on the following calabi - yau four - fold : @xmath378 where the action of the generator @xmath221 of @xmath52 is given by @xmath230 , @xmath379 , and it acts trivially on @xmath140 ; the action of the generator @xmath316 of @xmath48 is given by @xmath380 , @xmath381 , @xmath382 . here @xmath224 and @xmath147 parametrize",

    "note , however , that the @xmath48 singularities in the @xmath158 fibre @xmath41 are invariant under @xmath221 only in the @xmath384 cases .",
    "thus , there is no subtlety in the above map in these cases . in the @xmath376 cases , however , the @xmath48 singularities are not invariant under @xmath221 , so that we must be a bit more careful .",
    "in fact , the issue in the @xmath277 case is the same as in the @xmath263 case , so we can focus on the latter . moreover , instead of considering the generalized voisin - borcea orbifolds @xmath158",
    ", we will discuss this point for a simpler example , namely , the @xmath4 orbifold .",
    "the discussion for the other cases is completely analogous .",
    "thus , let us start from type i on @xmath385 , where the generator @xmath31 of @xmath4 acts on the complex coordinates @xmath281 parametrizing the three two - tori as @xmath386 ( @xmath387 , @xmath388 ) .",
    "the hodge numbers of this calabi - yau three - fold are given by @xmath389 .",
    "in this type i compactification , which was studied in detail in @xcite , we have 32 d9-branes and no d5-branes .",
    "the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions read @xmath390 ( in the @xmath58 basis ) .",
    "this implies that ( up to equivalent representations ) we have @xmath391 where @xmath61 .",
    "the gauge group of this model is @xmath392 , and the ( untwisted ) 99 open string sector contains the following chiral supermultiplets : @xmath393 plus @xmath394 .    here",
    "we would like to ask what is the t - dual ( where we t - dualize along both directions in the first @xmath41 ) of this type i background .",
    "that is , we would like to understand the dual type iib orientifold with d7-branes .",
    "in fact , to t - dualize we must first turn on wilson lines which break the original @xmath81 gauge group ( before @xmath4 orbifolding ) to @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , the corresponding t - dual of type i on @xmath108 is the @xmath216 orientifold of type iib on @xmath395 , where @xmath396 , and @xmath397 .",
    "note that @xmath398 has four fixed points at which are located the corresponding orientifold 7-planes .",
    "we must place 8 d7-branes at each of these orientifold 7-planes to properly cancel tadpoles ( this statement is precise in the perturbative orientifold context ) .",
    "thus , the gauge group is @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , let us see what are the locations of these fixed points .",
    "in order for @xmath41 s to have @xmath4 symmetry ( by which we are ultimately going to mod out ) , they must be hexagonal .",
    "let us focus on the first @xmath41 whose volume we will denote by @xmath399 .",
    "then the metric on @xmath41 is given by @xmath400 , @xmath401 , where @xmath402 are the vectors spanning the @xmath148 lattice .",
    "that is , @xmath403 .",
    "the @xmath214 fixed points are located at @xmath404 , @xmath405 , @xmath406 , where @xmath407 .",
    "the t - dual type i configuration of the above type iib orientifold is given by the following .",
    "start from type i with 32 d9-branes on @xmath395 .",
    "turn on two wilson lines - one on the @xmath99-cycle and the other one on the @xmath101-cycle of the first @xmath41 - such that they break the @xmath81 gauge symmetry down to @xmath102 .",
    "this is precisely the configuration we are looking for .",
    "note that this setup is symmetric under @xmath53 valued permutations of any three of the four @xmath96 subgroups accompanied by @xmath98 rotations of the first @xmath41 . under these rotations",
    "the first wilson line maps to the second wilson line ( as the @xmath99-cycle maps to the @xmath101-cycle on @xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore , we can mod out by the @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the corresponding gauge bundle is given by the following chan - paton matrix : @xmath408 where @xmath409 is a @xmath410 matrix of cyclic permutations , and @xmath411 .",
    "note that we still have @xmath390 , so that the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions are satisfied .",
    "the resulting gauge group is @xmath412 , and the matter consists of chiral supermultiplets in @xmath413 plus @xmath414 .",
    "the @xmath96 factor arises as the diagonal subgroup of the original @xmath415 subgroup on which the permutation matrix @xmath409 is acting .",
    "the @xmath416 factor is the corresponding subgroup of the fourth @xmath96 .",
    "the above @xmath412 model actually is on the same moduli as the original @xmath392 model @xcite .",
    "the former point in the moduli space is t - dual of the corresponding type iib orientifold with d7-branes , and the latter can now be readily mapped to f - theory .",
    "the corresponding compactification space is given by the four - fold @xmath417 , which has @xmath238 holonomy , and is an elliptic fibration of @xmath223 over the base @xmath418 .",
    "we can generalize the above discussion to other examples of this type .",
    "in particular , type i on @xmath377 ( where @xmath140 is either a k3 surface or @xmath46 ) with the appropriately turned on wilson lines is dual to f - theory on the elliptic four - fold ( [ four - fold ] ) .",
    "the euler number of a four - fold is expressed in terms of the corresponding hodge numbers via : @xmath419 however , for elliptic four - folds we have @xmath420 so it suffices to give the hodge numbers @xmath421 to specify such a four - fold . in particular , we have @xmath422 for illustrative purposes , here we give the hodge numbers of the four - folds corresponding to type i on the @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath423 , and @xmath424 orbifolds ( other cases are straightforward to work out ) : @xmath425 note that in the @xmath6 and @xmath11 cases we have the same four - fold .",
    "this is not surprising as the corresponding three - folds were also the same .",
    "finally , we would like to apply the above map to f - theory to better understand the non - perturbative inconsistency we have encountered in the @xmath11 case with the particular gauge bundle discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the point here is that in the f - theory language the action of the orientifold projection @xmath28 is geometrized - it is mapped to the action of @xmath214 .",
    "now , in the case of the four - fold compactifications of f - theory we must specify the action of @xmath214 not only on the four complex coordinates , but also on the gauge bundle .",
    "more precisely , in , say , the @xmath11 case we have to specify the action of the orbifold group @xmath11 on various gauge degrees of freedom , that is , we have to specify the gauge bundle . in the orientifold language",
    "this is described by the chan - paton matrices , while in the heterotic language this is done in terms of the @xmath367 lattice shifts . in the f - theory context",
    "we must also specify the orbifold action of the corresponding gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , in the @xmath4 example discussed above the @xmath4 orbifold acts geometrically on the three @xmath96 s ( corresponding to @xmath426 singularities in the fibre @xmath223 ) by permuting them - this is precisely what happens to the three @xmath214 fixed points @xmath405 , @xmath406 , under the action of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the action of @xmath4 on the fourth @xmath96 ( corresponding to the fixed point @xmath404 ) is no longer purely geometric - it breaks @xmath96 down to @xmath416 , which implies that there is non - trivial gauge bundle associated with the embedding of the @xmath4 orbifold action on the corresponding gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "the situation here is similar to what happens in the heterotic compactifications - we must embed some number of instantons which break the gauge group .",
    "now , the action of @xmath214 on the @xmath11 twisted sectors _ as well as _ the corresponding gauge bundles must be one and the same representation of the orbifold group . in the gauge bundle we discussed in the previous subsection the orbifold group ( in the four - fold context )",
    "is @xmath427 , whereas its embedding in terms of the gauge bundle would be the non - abelian dihedral group @xmath428 .",
    "these two actions are clearly incompatible , hence the non - perturbative inconsistency ( which , in particular , manifests itself via a non - perturbative anomaly ) in the @xmath11 model .",
    "in the previous sections we have discussed various non - perturbative orientifolds corresponding to type i compactifications on k3 and calabi - yau three - folds . our discussion so far has been confined to the cases with trivial ns - ns antisymmetric @xmath43-field .",
    "it would be interesting to understand non - perturbative orientifolds with non - zero @xmath43-field , and one example of such a compactification was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will not consider these models in detail in this paper as we are planning to discuss such compactifications elsewhere @xcite .",
    "however , here we would like to point out an additional set of models arising in the _ perturbative _ k3 orientifolds ( which complement those discussed in @xcite ) as their generalizations to non - perturbative orientifolds might lead to interesting new models in six and four dimensions .    the key point here is the following .",
    "consider the @xmath28 orientifold of type iib on @xmath91 without the @xmath43-field .",
    "this is the model of @xcite .",
    "note that the action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton factors is given by the chan - paton matrix @xmath429 where @xmath31 is the generator of @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to the gauge bundle without vector structure ( see section ii for details ) .",
    "here we can ask whether we can take the chan - paton matrix to be given by @xmath430 which would also satisfy the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions . in this case",
    "we would have the gauge bundle with vector structure .",
    "however , this choice can be seen to be inconsistent .",
    "the point is that the gauge group in this case is @xmath431_{99}\\otimes [ sp(16)\\otimes sp(16)]_{55}$ ] ( in our conventions @xmath432 has rank @xmath324 ) , and the matter consists of hypermultiplets in @xmath433 note that in the 59 sectors we have half - hypermultiplets in _ real _ representations , which is inconsistent , albeit the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition ( [ anom ] ) is satisfied in this case ( note that the number of extra tensor multiplets is zero ) .",
    "note , however , that , as was pointed out in @xcite , if we turn on the @xmath43-field of rank @xmath101 ( @xmath434 in the case of k3 compactifications ) , the 59 sector states come with multiplicity @xmath435 ( while the rank of the gauge group is reduced by @xmath435 @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the 59 sector states no longer need to come in half - hypermultiplets .",
    "thus , consider the @xmath436 case .",
    "the chan - paton matrix is given by : @xmath437 the gauge group now is @xmath438_{99}\\otimes   [ sp(8)\\otimes sp(8)]_{55}$ ] , and the matter consists of hypermultiplets in @xmath439 this spectrum is completely consistent , and , in particular , the gravitational anomaly cancels ( the number of extra tensor multiplets in this model is 4 , which follows from the results of @xcite ) . note that this model was originally discussed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can generalize the above discussion to other perturbative k3 orientifolds , that is , the @xmath29 orientifolds of type iib on @xmath51 , @xmath40 .",
    "( note that in the @xmath52 case the action of @xmath30 is trivial . ) actually , in the @xmath53 case nothing changes as we do not have a @xmath52 subgroup , but in other cases we do obtain new models with non - zero @xmath43-field .",
    "here we give the twisted chan - paton matrices for these models , which we label @xmath440 $ ] ( @xmath31 is the generator of @xmath48 ) : @xmath441:~~~\\gamma_g={\\mbox{diag}}({\\bf i}_4,-{\\bf i}_4)~,\\nonumber\\\\   & & [ 2,4]:~~~\\gamma_g={\\mbox{diag}}({\\bf i}_2,-{\\bf i}_2)~,\\nonumber\\\\   & & [ 3,2]:~~~\\gamma_g={\\mbox{diag}}(\\alpha{\\bf i}_4,\\alpha^{-1 }   { \\bf i}_4)~,\\nonumber\\\\   & & [ 3,4]:~~~\\gamma_g={\\bf i}_4~,\\nonumber\\\\   & & [ 4,2]:~~~\\gamma_g={\\mbox{diag}}(i{\\bf i}_2,-i{\\bf i}_2,{\\bf i}_2 ,   -{\\bf i}_2)~,\\nonumber\\\\   & & [ 4,4]:~~~\\gamma_g={\\mbox{diag}}(i ,-",
