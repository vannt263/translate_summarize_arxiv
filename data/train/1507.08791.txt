    "the atomic coherence generated between dipole - forbidden states due to two laser beams plays an important role in the abrupt enhancement of transmission or absorption .",

    "is observed when a third laser beam is introduced in two - beam spectroscopy setup , which displays eit . in this spectroscopic setup , three - photon atomic coherence results in enhanced absorption , rather than the enhanced transmission that aries from two - photon coherence .",
    "this enhanced absorption is known to result from constructive interference @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that destructive interference with three laser beams can be observed for different transition geometries @xcite .",
    "many studies on three - photon spectroscopy are reported in the literature .",
    "a narrow resonance was observed in a four - level atomic system @xcite .",

    "ben - aroya also reported large - contrast absorption resonances in an n - type scheme @xcite . an optical clock based on three - photon resonance",

    "calculations within the simple four - level model showed that this absorption phenomenon was due to three - photon coherence .",
    "they also studied the relationship between two- and three - photon coherence @xcite .",
    "as in previous studies @xcite , where the two coupling beams were linearly polarized in perpendicular directions , three - photon coherence was the main cause of the enhanced absorption . however , when the two coupling beams were polarized in the same direction , it was not obvious whether or not three - photon coherence was established .",
    "enhanced absorption may also have been observed in this case .",
    "it should be also noted that tpeia is different from the conventional eia where the absorption results from the transfer of the zeeman coherence of the excited state @xcite .",
    "the main cause of the absorption in tpeia is the three - photon coherence generated between the ground and intermediate states .",
    "we here present a theoretical and analytical study of tpeia for two schemes , where the coupling - beam polarizations are either parallel or perpendicular to one another . to study tpeia analytically",

    "the probe beam is tuned to the @xmath2 transition , and two counter - propagating coupling beams are tuned to the @xmath3 transition . as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , all the laser beams are linearly polarized , but two polarization configurations are considered . in the first ( parallel ) scheme ,",
    "the polarization vectors of the probe , the first , and second coupling beams are in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath5 directions , respectively . in the second ( perpendicular ) scheme ,",

    "1(a ) , the double - sided arrows and the dots denote the direction of the electric field of the laser beams .",
    "thus , the polarizations of the coupling beams are parallel ( perpendicular ) for the first ( second ) configuration . when the polarization direction of the probe beam is chosen as the quantization axis , the energy - level diagrams for the parallel and perpendicular polarization schemes are those shown in figs .",

    "as can be seen in these figures , the transition schemes for the two configurations are completely different . in the parallel configuration ,",
    "the two coupling beams are tuned to the same transition lines , whereas those beams are tuned to the different transition lines in the perpendicular configuration .",
    "the analytical calculation of the absorption coefficients for the basic units of these two schemes is discussed in the next section .",
    "figure 2 shows typical experimental results for eit and tpeia .",
    "we refer to previous papers for the details of the experimental setup @xcite .",
    "the powers of the probe and of the first and second coupling beams were 8 @xmath6w , 20 mw , and 20 mw , respectively .",
    "the diameter of the laser beams was 2 mm . in fig .",
    "2 , we present two tpeia spectra for the parallel and perpendicular polarization configurations , and an eit spectrum obtained in the absence of the second coupling beam . in fig .",
    "2 , the frequency of the probe beam was tuned to the resonant transition @xmath2 , whereas the frequencies of the coupling beams were scanned around the transition @xmath7 . as discussed previously @xcite , the eit signal transformed into the absorption signal when the second coupling beam was introduced . as can be seen in fig . 2 for the two polarization configurations , the two tpeia spectra for the @xmath8 transition are very similar .",
    "as mentioned above , the interaction energy level diagrams for these two schemes are very different . however , we observed very similar tpeia spectra for the two schemes , as can be seen in fig .",
    "this is the motivation of our work .",
    "to study the similarity and difference between the results of tpeia for the two polarization configurations analytically , we used the two simplified energy - level diagrams shown in fig .",

    "the decay rates of the states @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , and the decay rates of the optical coherences between the states @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the wavelengths , wave vectors , and detunings of the probe ( coupling ) beam are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) , respectively .",

    "we considered the solutions up to the first order in the probe rabi frequency . in the energy level diagram shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the two coupling beams were tuned to the transition between @xmath34 and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the frequency mixing produced a variety of oscillation frequencies for the optical coherences and populations .",
    "because of the weak probe intensity , the optical coherence @xmath35 can be neglected , and thus we need consider only the optical coherences @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , all the stationary and oscillating terms in the populations vanish except for the stationary term of @xmath38 , which is unity in the limit of weak probe intensity .",
    "if the probe beam is not quite weak , the coherent population oscillation ( cpo ) in the populations of the ground , intermediate , and excited states should be considered @xcite . in this case",
