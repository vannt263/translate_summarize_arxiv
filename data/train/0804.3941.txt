    "in this section we will consider in details the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model with the small curvature .",
    "the main features and differences from a conventional ( large curvature ) scenario will be pointed to .",
    "the rs model  @xcite is a theory with one extra dimension ( ed ) in a slice of the ads@xmath4 space - time .",
    "it has the following background warped metric : @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 being the `` radius '' of the ed , and @xmath9 is the minkowski metric .",
    "the points @xmath10 and @xmath11 are identified , so one gets the orbifold @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 defines a 5-dimensional scalar curvature of the ads@xmath4 space . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will call @xmath1 `` curvature '' .",
    "the so - called rs1 model has two 3d branes with equal and opposite tensions located at the points @xmath13 ( called the tev brane ) and @xmath14 ( referred to as the plank brane ) . if @xmath15 , the tension on the tev brane is negative , whereas the tension on the planck brane is positive .",
    "all the sm fields are constrained to the tev brane , while the gravity propagates in four spacial dimensions .",
    "it is necessary to note that metric is chosen in such a way that 4-dimensional coordinates @xmath16 are galilean on the tev brane where all the sm field live , since the warp factor is equal to unity at @xmath13 .    by integrating 5-dimensional action over variable @xmath17",
    ", one gets an effective 4-dimensional action , that results in the `` hierarchy relation '' between the reduced planck scale @xmath18 and 5-dimensional reduced gravity scale @xmath19 : @xmath20    the reduced gravity scale @xmath19 is related to the planck mass @xmath2 by the equation @xmath21 unless explicitly stated otherwise , we consider the _ reduced _ 5-dimensional planck scale .    from the point of view of a 4-dimensional observer located on the tev brane",
    ", there exists an infinite number of graviton kk excitations with the masses @xmath22 where @xmath23 are zeros of the bessel function @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath25 .",
    "the interaction of the kk gravitons with the the sm fields on the tev brane is described by the lagrangian : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter , and @xmath28 is the graviton field with the kk - number @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the physical scale on the tev brane .    note that in most of the papers which treated the rs model ( including ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the background metric was taken to be @xmath32 instead of expression .",
    "in such a case , the hierarchy relation looks like @xmath33 with the graviton masses @xmath34    in order the hierarchy relation to be satisfied , while the lightest graviton masses to be around one tev , one has to introduce two huge mass scales ( _ large curvature option _ ) , @xmath35 and take @xmath36 .",
    "thus , one obtains a series of graviton resonances with the lightest kk mode around one tev .",
    "the experimental signature of the the rs model with the large curvature is a real or virtual production of the massive kk graviton resonances .",
    "there exists a serious shortcoming of the scenario with the curvature and fundamental gravity scale being of the order of the planck mass  .",
    "namely , _ kinetic terms _ of the graviton fields on the tev brane _ do not have a canonical form _ , and lorentz indices are raised with the minkowski tensor , while the metric in the coordinates @xmath16 is @xmath37 ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the correct interpretation of the effective 4-dimensional theory can be achieved by changing variables : @xmath38 as one can see , metric turns into metric under such a replacement .    in the present paper",
    "we will use an approach based on the metric   ( _ small curvature option _",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) and put @xmath39 in order the hierarchy relation to be satisfied , it is then necessary to take @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "thus , no large scales are introduced , contrary to the large curvature case . in",
    "what follows , the rs1 model with the small curvature will be referred to as _ large warped dimension _ scheme .    instead of the fact that the size of the ed @xmath8 is of the order of 1 fm , and masses of the first kk gravitons are relatively small , they give a negligible correction to the newton law .",
    "indeed , the newton potential between two test masses @xmath42 and @xmath43 separated by the distance @xmath44 is equal to @xmath45 since @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the first zero of the bessel function @xmath24 , we find that the relative correction from the kk gravitons to the newton law is less than @xmath48 .    in our scheme ,",
    "a coupling of the kk graviton with the sm fields is rather weak , tev . ] since @xmath49 however , in physical matrix elements the smallness of the coupling @xmath50 is compensated by the large number of real gravitons which can be produced or by infinite number of virtual gravitons . as a result",
    ", the matrix elements are defined by the 5-dimensional gravity scale @xmath19 , not by @xmath30 or @xmath1 separately  @xcite .",
    "this circumstance reminds that in the add model with flat eds  @xcite .",
    "previously , we studied gravity effects in the rs1 model with the small curvature in the scattering of ultrahigh neutrinos off the nucleon  @xcite , in exclusive double diffractive events at the lhc  @xcite , as well as in @xmath51 annihilation into lepton pairs at the ilc  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to estimate gravity effects in a two - photon production at the lhc .",
    "the search limits on the fundamental planck scale will be derived which are insensitive to the curvature of the warped space - time of the model .",
    "diphoton final states are a signature of many interesting physics processes . for instance , one of the main discovery channels for the higgs boson search at the lhc is the @xmath52 final state",
    ". an excess of @xmath52 production could be a signature of interactions beyond the sm .",
    "in addition , the diphoton final state is interesting in its own right . using good energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite , the transverse momentum of the photons , @xmath0 , can be directly determined with a good precision .",
    "a possible excess in @xmath0-distribution could indicate effects coming from a new physics , in particular , from large eds .",
    "what is the reason to consider large warped dimension scenario ?",
    "first , the spectrum of the kk gravitons is very similar to that in the model with _",
    "one _ ed  @xcite ( see previous section ) .",
    "second , all matrix elements for the scattering of the sm fields can be formally obtained from corresponding matrix elements calculated in the model with one _ flat _",
    "dimension by using the following replacement  @xcite : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is a 5-dimensional reduced planck scale , @xmath55 being the radius of the extra flat dimension . as a result , all cross sections appear to be rather large ( as in the add model with @xmath56 dimensions ) . finally , as was shown in ref .",

    "@xmath65 denotes the cross section of the hard sub - process @xmath66 .",
    "we have introduced the dimensional variable @xmath67 throughout the paper , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote mandelstam variables of the _ partonic sub - process _ ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "the contribution of the virtual gravitons to the process comes from the quark - antiquark annihilation , @xmath74 the matrix elements for both the partonic sub - processes  - are given by the expression @xmath75 the fist factor in the r.h.s .",
    "is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy - momentum tensor of the quark ( gluon ) field , @xmath78 is the photon energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the graviton exchange in the @xmath79-channel leads to the following expression : @xmath80 here @xmath81 denotes a total width of the graviton with the kk number @xmath29 and mass @xmath82 : @xmath83 with @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "the width is small provided @xmath29 is not extremely large .",
    "then the relevant partonic cross sections are ( see , for instance , formulae in appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath87 .    in the region",
    "@xmath88 , the sum can be calculated analytically , an explicit form of the function @xmath89 was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath90 where @xmath91    should we ignore the widths of the massive gravitons , and replace the summation in kk number by the integration in graviton masses using the relation @xmath92 , we get @xmath93 in contrast to formula .    at @xmath94 , we get from - : @xmath95 the inequality @xmath96 is equivalent to the inequality @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the mass splitting , and @xmath81 is the graviton width for relevant kk numbers ( corresponding to @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , one may regard a set of narrow graviton resonances to be a continuous mass spectrum .",
    "however , the kinematical region for our treatment is @xmath100 . in this case , expressions become incorrect , and formula , which takes into account the _ nonzero widths _ of the kk gravitons , should be used .    in appendix",

    "the gravity effects were searched for by studying photon energy spectrum in the process @xmath102 .",
    "no deviations from the sm prediction were seen .",

    "[ fig : tevatron_sm_grav ] we present the result of our calculations of gravity effects in the diphoton production @xmath111 at the tevatron .",

    "let @xmath113 be a number of signal events , @xmath114 - number of background events .",
    "we define the statistical significance @xmath115 , and require a @xmath116 effect .",
    "then we obtain the following bound from the tevatron data ( with the integrated luminosity @xmath117 ) : @xmath118 in calculating numbers of events , we used a k - factor 1.5 for the sm background , while a conservative value of k=1 was taken for the signal .",
    "let us stress that in our approach , the limit on @xmath19 does not depend on the value of the parameter @xmath1 , provided the inequality @xmath119 is satisfied ( see section  [ sec : details ] for details ) .",
    "we expect that the gravity effects related with the virtual gluon exchange will be more significant at the lhc , since @xmath120 where @xmath121 depends weakly on @xmath79 via scaling violation in pdfs .",
    "the gravity term @xmath122 depends rather slowly on @xmath79 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "thus , we obtain : @xmath123 correspondingly , the search limit for the lhc can be roughly estimated to be @xmath124 tev .    in order to obtain a correct search limit for the lhc , we have calculated contributions of @xmath79-channel gravitons to @xmath0-distributions of the final photons for different values of @xmath19 ( see fig .

    "another systematic theoretical error comes from an uncertainty in cross sections due to a certain proton pdfs . adopting that it does not exceed 2.7%  @xcite , we get @xmath138 gev .    one of systematic experimental uncertainties contributing to the number of events comes from luminosity measurements .",
    "the design precision of the luminosity is 5% at @xmath117  @xcite .",
    "however , for measurements based on @xmath139 or more , it is assumed that a 3% uncertainty can be achieved  @xcite that results in @xmath140 gev .",
    "the error in measurements of the photon transverse momenta is less than 0.74% at @xmath141 gev  @xcite .",

    "then a corresponding variation of the significance @xmath134 can be compensated by much smaller variation of the 5-dimensional gravity scale : @xmath147 .",
