    "continuous quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) in itinerant electron systems are conventionally described within a ginzburg - landau - wilson picture of critical fluctuations of an order parameter characterizing a spontaneously broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , experiments on heavy - fermion metals @xcite have established the existence of a class of antiferromagnetic quantum critical points ( qcps ) that can be understood only by postulating additional critical modes beyond order - parameter fluctuations @xcite . it has been proposed @xcite that the additional modes arise from the critical destruction of the kondo effect , associated with a jump in the fermi - surface volume @xcite from large in the paramagnetic phase ( where unpaired @xmath11 electrons are absorbed into kondo resonances ) to small in the antiferromagnetic phase ( where the kondo resonances are destroyed and the @xmath11 electrons are localized ) .",
    "the picture of critical kondo destruction was originally developed in the kondo limit of integer @xmath11 occupancy .",
    "more recently , the discovery of unconventional quantum criticality @xcite in mixed - valent @xcite @xmath2-ybalb@xmath3 has prompted interest in critical kondo destruction at mixed valence .",
    "a toy model for this phenomenon is the particle - hole - asymmetric anderson impurity model with a density of states @xmath12 that vanishes in power - law fashion on approach to the fermi energy @xmath13 .",
    "the model features a kondo - destruction qcp separating a strong - coupling ( kondo - screened ) phase from a local - moment ( kondo - destroyed ) phase @xcite .",
    "a study conducted using a combination of continuous - time quantum monte carlo and the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) showed for the particular case @xmath4 that kondo destruction was accompanied by divergence of a local charge susceptibility on approach to the qcp from either phase @xcite . in this case , both spin and charge responses demonstrate the frequency - over - temperature and magnetic field - over - temperature scaling characteristic of an interacting qcp .",
    "this paper extends the numerical results provided in ref . by determining a complete set of static charge critical exponents for different values of the band exponent @xmath14 in the range @xmath15",
    "over which the asymmetric pseudogap anderson model has an interacting qcp that is distinct from that of its symmetric counterpart @xcite .",
    "we provide a unified description of both the spin and charge critical behaviors in terms of an ansatz for the form of the free energy near the qcp , expressing all critical exponents in terms of just two underlying exponents @xcite , which can be termed ( in the nomenclature of classical phase transitions ) the `` correlation - length '' exponent @xmath7 and the `` gap '' exponent @xmath8 .",
    "the ansatz leads to scaling equations that are obeyed to high accuracy by numerically determined values of the charge exponents .",
