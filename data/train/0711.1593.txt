    "in present - day nuclear and particle physics experiments , inorganic scintillating crystals , such as nai(tl ) and csi(tl ) , are often used to construct electromagnetic calorimeters when a precise measurement of the energy is required  @xcite .",
    "crystal calorimeters can be finely segmented in the dimension transverse to the shower development without sacrificing energy resolution , thus providing a good measurement of the lateral shower development . however , engineering and energy resolution considerations prevent finely segmenting crystal calorimeters along the direction of shower development .",
    "both lateral and longitudinal shower development information are useful in charged particle identification ( pid ) algorithms , particularly in electron identification .",
    "because crystal calorimeters can not provide direct longitudinal shower development information , they lose an important input to particle identification .    in this paper",
    ", we present a technique in which longitudinal shower development information is indirectly extracted from a longitudinally unsegmented crystal calorimeter in conjunction with a precise tracking system .",
    "this technique was developed for use with the  @xcite detector , but it can be applied at any detector which combines crystal calorimetry and precision tracking .",
    "it exploits the fact that  has a tracking system capable of precisely determining the three - dimensional trajectory of charged particles , and the fact that these trajectories are not in general collinear with the crystal axes .",
    "a similar algorithm has previously been used for sampling calorimeters with fine lateral segmentation  @xcite .",
    "we also explore the usefulness of the derived longitudinal shower information for particle identification at .",
    "we show that using this information as part of an electron identification algorithm improves the electron _ vs. _",
    "pion discrimination , particularly at momenta below 600@xmath0 .",
    "we also show that this information can be generally used to improve the separation of the five most common charged particles ( , , ,  and ) , owing to the different longitudinal shower development in a crystal calorimeter of these different particle types .",
    "in particular , we find that the longitudinal shower information significantly increases the minimum momentum reach at which muons can be separated from pions in .",
    "we further verify that the energy dependence of the indirect electron longitudinal shower information behaves as expected from electromagnetic shower models .",
    "the  detector consists of a tracking system surrounded by a dedicated pid device , a crystal calorimeter , and an array of flux return iron plates instrumented with muon detectors .",
    "a detailed description of the  detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we briefly describe those systems important for the algorithms described in this paper .",
    "the  tracking system is composed of a silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) comprising five layers of double - sided detectors and a 40-layer central drift chamber ( dch ) .",
    "operating in a 1.5 t solenoidal magnetic field , it provides a transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) resolution @xmath2 for detecting charged particles , where @xmath1 and its rms error @xmath3 are measured in @xmath4 .",
    "both the dch and the svt measure the specific ionization ( @xmath5 ) of charged particles which pass through them .",
    "the @xmath5  resolution from the dch varies as a function of track polar angle , having an average value of around @xmath6 for the majority of physics processes that we study in .",
    "the @xmath5  resolution from the svt is typically about @xmath7 .",
    "the  ring - imaging cherenkov detector ( dirc ) provides dedicated charged particle identification in the central part of the detector .",
    "the polar angle coverage in the laboratory frame is @xmath8 .",
    "the cherenkov angle resolution of the dirc is measured to be @xmath9 , for the quartz refractive index of 1.473 , which provides better than @xmath10 separation between charged kaons and pions over a broad kinematic range .",
    "the  electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) consists of an array of 6580 csi(tl ) crystals , which encloses the tracking system and dirc .",
    "the crystals have a truncated trapezoidal shape , and are finely segmented in the plane transverse to particles coming from the nominal  interaction point ( ip ) , with a typical cross - section of @xmath11 at the front and @xmath12 at the back .",
    "the crystals range in depth between 16 and 17.5 radiation lengths ( the radiation length of csi(tl ) is @xmath13 ) , with the crystal axis pointing back roughly to the ip .",
    "the emc geometry can be approximately described as a central cylindrical barrel , divided into forward ( @xmath14 ) and backward ( @xmath15 ) regions , plus a conical forward endcap ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the crystals are staggered so that their front face presents a nearly normal surface to particles coming from the ip .",
    "the emc covers about @xmath17 of the polar angle and all of the azimuth in the center - of - mass system of the collisions produced in 2  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] ) .",
    "the energy resolution of the calorimeter has been measured _ in - situ _ using a combination of radioactive sources , symmetric decays of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and bhabha events , and can be described as : @xmath20{e(\\mbox{gev})}}\\oplus(1.35\\pm0.22)\\%,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 refer to the shower energy and its rms error , measured in @xmath23 .",
    "the angular resolution is limited by the transverse crystal size and the distance from the ip .",
    "it can also be parameterized as an energy - dependent function @xmath24    the emc is surrounded by a series of iron plates arranged as coaxial octagonal cylinders about the  symmetry axis .",
    "these plates form a high - susceptibility path for the magnetic flux generated by the solenoid to close on itself . between the iron plates",
    "are resistive plate chambers and limited streamer tubes with binary readout , used to track muons and provide crude neutral hadron detection .",
    "the innermost layers of muon chambers act effectively as a ` tail catcher ' for the emc , detecting particles from showers that leak out the back .",
    "to derive longitudinal shower development information from  we exploit the fact that most particles do not enter the calorimeter exactly parallel to the crystal axes .",
    "a non - zero entrance angle transforms the transverse crystal segmentation into an effective longitudinal segmentation , providing some depth information .",
    "because the effective longitudinal segmentation is poor ( often fractional ) and different for every particle , we do not attempt a full parameterization of the longitudinal shower development .",
    "instead , we characterize the shower by the first moment of its longitudinal development , which we call the _ longitudinal shower depth _ ( ) .",
    "the  value is closely related to , but not identical to , the position of the electromagnetic shower maximum , as is discussed in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "the  variable is a geometric quantity which exploits the fact that the track and the cluster both sample different two - dimensional projections of the three - dimensional shower spatial distribution . when the track direction is not parallel to the crystal axis",
    ", these projections are not fully degenerate , and they can be combined to extract the otherwise unobservable , third ( longitudinal ) dimension .",
    "three effects are responsible for the fact that the track direction and the crystal axis are not collinear .",
    "first , the magnetic field bends the track as it passes through the tracking volume .",
    "second , the width of the beamspot in the beam direction causes tracks from the ip to have a different polar angle from that of the axis of the crystal they strike . finally , by design , the crystal axes of the  calorimeter do not project perfectly back to the nominal ip , which reduces the chance of particles from the ip passing perfectly between crystals .    as part of computing",
    "we describe the calorimeter cluster as a directed line segment in space .",
    "we first compute the two - dimensional cluster centroid using the standard  algorithm , which takes the weighted average of the crystal center positions at a nominal depth of 12 cm , using a logarithm of the crystal energy as weight  @xcite .",
    "we then compute the weighted average direction of the crystal axes , using the energy in each crystal as ( linear ) weight .",
    "the cluster line segment is defined to pass through the cluster centroid , and point in the average crystal direction .",
    "the starting point of the cluster line segment is taken as the average position of the crystal front faces projected along the average direction .     -1.3",
    "cm    we then calculate the point of closest approach ( poca ) in three dimensions between the extrapolated track trajectory and the cluster line segment , using an iterative algorithm .",
    "the poca is the point where the track and cluster projections of the particle trajectory are most consistent .",
    "conceptually , we define  as the path distance the track travels in the calorimeter s sensitive volume in reaching the poca . in practice , we define  as the distance along the cluster line segment of the poca , divided by the cosine of the angle between the track direction and the cluster line segment direction , given algebraically as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the position of the poca , @xmath27 is a point on the front face of the crystal , @xmath28 is a unit vector in the direction of the cluster line segment , and @xmath29 is the angle between the track direction and the cluster axis direction .",
    "this quantity approximates the material path distance , but is much simpler to compute .",
    "our definition of  ignores the effects of track curvature and crystal - face staggering , which are negligible on the scale of the resolution we achieve on . the definition of  is presented graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltal ] .",
    "we evaluate the usefulness of  for particle identification with the control samples of relatively pure electrons , pions , kaons , muons and protons .",
    "the considered control samples are selected from the data collected with the  detector at the 2  asymmetric energy ( @xmath30 on @xmath31 )  collider , operating near the resonance which subsequently decays into a  meson pair . in the following ,",
    "we briefly outline the salient features of the control samples .",
    "we select electrons in both radiative and non - radiative bhabha events [ @xmath32 by utilizing requirements on the energy deposit and shower - shape variables in the emc , and by rejecting track candidates consistent with being muons . based on monte carlo studies ,",
    "the purity of this sample is found to be @xmath33 .",
    "as bhabha events provide mostly high momenta electrons , we consider the two - photon mediated process @xmath34 to enhance statistics in the low - to - medium momentum range ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the selection requirement for this process provides a clean sample of electrons with purity comparable to that of the bhabha events .",
    "pion candidates are selected from the decay process @xmath36 and the @xmath37 events with 3 - 1 track topology .",
    "the purity of the  sample selection , determined with a mixture of simulated  decays and @xmath38 continuum events , is found to be @xmath39 .",
    "pions from @xmath40-pair events are affected by kaon contamination , having a purity of about @xmath41 .",
    "however , this sample provides high - momentum pions not found in the @xmath36 sample .",
    "the electron contamination in the @xmath40-pair pion sample is very small .",
    "in addition to the electron and pion control samples , we use kaons selected from the decay chain @xmath42 ; protons from the @xmath43 decay , @xmath44 ; and muons selected in radiative muon - pair events , @xmath45 .",
    "these samples have the best purity for the corresponding track - candidate selection in , which is comparable to that of the considered electron and pion samples .",
    "to test the impact of  on electron identification , we start with an electron selector based on two standard variables : the ratio of the shower energy deposited in the calorimeter to the momentum of the track associated with the shower ( @xmath46 ) and the lateral shower moment , defined as @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the total number of crystals associated to a shower , @xmath49 is the energy deposited in the @xmath50-th crystal such that @xmath51 , @xmath52 the lateral distance between center of the shower and @xmath50-th crystal as defined earlier , and @xmath53 which is approximately the average distance between two crystals .",
    "like , these variables involve calorimetry and tracking measurements only . by evaluating the incremental improvement given by adding  to this selector",
    ", we test the impact of  including the effect of possible correlations between  and other similar variables .",
    "we describe the electron identification performance in terms of the electron efficiency and the pion misidentification of the algorithm .",
    "we use the tmva ( toolkit for parallel multivariate data analysis ) package  @xcite to build a global likelihood function using @xmath46 and @xmath54 , together ( or not ) with .    to study the pion misidentification probability for a given value of electron i d efficiency ,",
    "first we define a likelihood ratio , @xmath55 , for each track candidate in the considered signal and background samples by : @xmath56 here , the signal and background likelihoods ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) are products of corresponding probability density functions ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) of the three discriminating variables : @xmath61 after that , for a given value of the likelihood ratio , the signal identification efficiency and the background misidentification probability are calculated .",
    "this is done for different momentum bins , separately in the forward and the backward barrel , and the endcap regions , using the control samples of electrons and pions discussed in the previous section .    .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : fb ] shows the electron efficiency _ vs. _ pion misidentification probability for a typical low momentum bin ( @xmath62 ) in the forward barrel emc .",
    "it is evident that for any given value of electron identification efficiency the likelihood function based on  gives a lower pion misidentification compared to the case where  is not included .",
    "table  [ tab : barrel_likelihood ] summarizes results obtained across the full kinematic range for various parts of the emc .",
    "there is a clear improvement in the performance for the backward and forward barrel regions , while for the endcap region ( where high momenta particles are mostly abundant ) , we find a marginal improvement .",
    "this is because the discrimination power of  diminishes with increasing energy .",
    "the  variable can also be used to enhance general charged particle identification , as it is sensitive to the differing longitudinal shower development of different particle types .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pidall ] , which plots  for different species of particles , broken down into four track - momentum bins , using the  data pid control samples described in section [ sec : samples ] .        figure [ fig : pidall ] shows a clear distinction between the distributions of different particle species , particularly for momenta below 600@xmath0 .",
    "these distributions can be basically understood in terms of the different energy loss mechanisms at work ; for instance , low momentum protons are highly - ionizing , and so deposit most of their energy early in the crystals .",
    "by contrast , electrons deposit their energy near shower maximum ( roughly @xmath63 ) , while muons with momenta above 200@xmath0are minimum ionizing and so distribute their energy uniformly along their path through the emc . finally",
    ", pions and kaons produce broad  distributions , corresponding to the large variability of hadronic showers",

    "] , compared to 1.5@xmath64 separation from the dirc , less than 0.1@xmath64 separation from either dch or svt @xmath66  @xcite , and essentially no separation from @xmath46 .",
    "thus  provides an useful cross - check to the dirc when identifying muons at these momenta , and provides the best muon - pion separation for the 15% of the  solid angle covered by tracking and calorimetry but not by the dirc .    at momenta above @xmath67 ,",
    "the decrease in magnetic bending reduces the angle between the track direction and the crystal axis , degrading the resolution of .",
    "additionally , the longitudinal profile of energy deposition for different particle types tends to converge in this momentum region .",
    "some separation power still comes from different widths of  distributions for electrons compared to other particles , but this is a weak discriminant compared to other pid variables available in this momentum region .    the impact of  on muon identification at   has been evaluated using a powerful muon selection algorithm which uses a _ bagged decision tree _",
    "@xcite to combine many input variables .",
    "this algorithm was trained and evaluated using independent subsets of the data control samples described in section [ sec : samples ] . compared to an older algorithm which does not use , the minimum muon momentum for which the selector has at least 50% efficiency ( at a fixed pion misidentification probability ) was reduced from 800@xmath0to 270@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this improvement in low momentum muon selection efficiency is expected to have a significant impact on several important  physics measurements .",

    "the dominant systematic error comes from the alignment of the emc with respect to the  tracking system , which we estimate has an uncertainty of @xmath71mrad in the rotation around the beam axis . because this misalignment can depend on the track polar angle , and because the boost of 2  correlates energy with polar angle",
