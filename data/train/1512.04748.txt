    "the total domination of graphs was introduced by cockayne @xcite .",
    "the literature on this subject has been surveyed and detailed in the two excellent domination books by haynes @xcite @xcite who did an outstanding job of unifying results scattered through some 1200 domination papers at that time .",
    "more recent results on this topic can be found in @xcite .    throughout this paper ,",
    "all graphs are simple , that is they have no loops or multiple edges .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 and @xmath3 the vertex set and the edge set of @xmath0 , respectively . for two positive integers",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the cycle of order @xmath5 and the complete bipartite graph of sizes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple graph .",
    "the _ open neighborhood _ of a vertex @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath9 , is the set of vertices adjacent to @xmath8 in @xmath0 . for a subgraph @xmath10 of @xmath0 , the _ open neighborhood _ of @xmath10",
    "is defined as @xmath11 and is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the _ open neighborhood hypergraph _ of @xmath0 is a hypergraph on the same vertex set , where the hyperedges are defined as @xmath13 .",
    "a set @xmath14 of vertices is said to be a _ total dominating set _ of @xmath0 , if every vertex @xmath15 is adjacent to at least one vertex in @xmath16 .",
    "the _ total domatic number _ of a graph @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath17 , is the maximum number of total dominating sets which partition the vertex set of @xmath0 .",
    "one can easily see that for a graph @xmath0 with no isolated vertex , @xmath18 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is classifying of the family of cubic graphs for which @xmath19 .",
    "it is fairly easy to see that a graph can be partitioned into two total dominating sets , if and only if its open neighborhood hypergraph is bipartite .",
    "it is an easy consequence of the renowned lovsz local lemma @xcite that every @xmath20-uniform @xmath20-regular hypergraph is bipartite for all @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "alon and bregman @xcite improved that result by employing algebraic methods to assert that the same holds for @xmath22 .",
    "henning and yeo @xcite later adapted their technique to prove :    [ thm : hypergraph - bipartiteness ] ( @xcite ) every @xmath20-uniform @xmath20-regular hypergraph is bipartite for all @xmath23 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : hypergraph - bipartiteness ] immediately reveals that all @xmath20-regular graphs for @xmath23 can be partitioned into two total dominating sets .",
    "it is a well - known fact that a cycle has two disjoint total dominating sets , if and only if its order is divisible by @xmath24 . knowing that in the heawood graph , complement of no total dominating set is a total dominating set ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , exercise  3.14 ) , one naturally seeks to classify all cubic graphs which can be partitioned into two total dominating sets .",
    "this classification , combined with henning and yeo s result @xcite , characterizes the class of regular graphs whose vertices are impossible to be decomposed into two total dominating sets .",
    "it is briefly indicated in @xcite that there are infinitely many connected cubic graphs with total domatic number one , the characterization of which is an open problem .",
    "since coloring and partitioning are essentially the same , the total domination has also been studied in the literature of graph coloring under the name of coupon coloring @xcite .",
    "@xmath25-coupon coloring _ of a graph @xmath0 is an assignment of colors from @xmath26 to @xmath2 , such that for all @xmath15 , the open neighborhood of @xmath8 contains all @xmath25 colors .",
    "the maximum @xmath25 for which a @xmath25-coupon coloring of @xmath0 exists is called the _ coupon coloring number _ of @xmath0 .",

    "we prove our main result towards the characterization of cubic graphs @xmath0 with @xmath19 .",
    "before we embark on that , we state two relevant lemmas .",
