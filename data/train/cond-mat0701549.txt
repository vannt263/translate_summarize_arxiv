    "lateral interactions between species adsorbed at solid surfaces are crucial microscopic quantities that have been the target of surface science studies for a long time.@xcite these interactions govern both the equilibrium , as well as the non - equilibrium ordering behavior of the adsorbates , and thereby critically influence the surface function and properties in important applications like heterogeneous catalysis .",
    "traditionally , considerable efforts have been devoted to determine lateral interactions empirically from experimental data , e.g. from temperature programmed desorption or low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) measurements . in order to simplify the inherently indirect determination from sparse experimental data ,",
    "the assumption of exclusively pairwise interactions between the adsorbed species has often been applied . in recent years",
    ", algorithmic advances and increased computational power have made it possible to determine the lateral interactions alternatively from first - principles .",
    "most notably , these are approaches that parameterize lattice - gas hamiltonians ( lghs ) with density - functional theory ( dft ) energetics , also called cluster expansions.@xcite since the accuracy of the determined lateral interactions should be of the order of @xmath0 to properly describe the thermal ordering , a concern with this approach has been whether the employed first - principles energetics is actually accurate enough .    within this context",
    ", the present work has a methodological and a materials science motivation .",
    "the methodological motivation is to scrutinize both the assumption of exclusively pairwise interactions , and the accuracy with which the first - principles lgh approach can provide the lateral interactions . for this purpose",
    "we concentrate on a simple model case , namely the on - surface ordering of atomic adsorbates at a ( 100 ) cubic surface , for which extensive studies with model interactions have already been performed.@xcite to make contact with a specific material and with experiment , we specifically choose the on - surface adsorption of oxygen at pd(100 ) , for which detailed experimental data on the ordering behavior is available @xcite .",
    "since in this system higher oxygen coverages above @xmath1monolayers [ ml , defined with respect to the number of pd atoms in one layer of pd(100 ) ] induce structures containing incorporated oxygen @xcite , we concentrate on the low coverage regime .",
    "for this regime , two ordered structures have hitherto been characterized experimentally @xcite : a @xmath2-o structure at 0.25ml and a @xmath3-o structure at 0.5ml , both with o adsorbed in the on - surface fourfold hollow sites .",
    "the material science motivation of our first - principles lgh study is then to extract the lateral interactions operating between the adsorbed o atoms at the surface and to study the ordering behavior they imply .",
    "specifically , this is to see whether we can confirm the experimentally determined ordered structures , as well as the critical temperatures for the order - disorder transition in the low coverage regime .    presenting a systematic first - principles lattice - gas hamiltonian expansion",
    ", we indeed find the calculated set of lateral interaction energies to be fully consistent with the experimentally reported low coverage phase diagram . critically discussing the uncertainties of our approach ,",
    "both with respect to the employed lgh expansion and the underlying dft energetics , we conclude that they primarily affect the on - site energy .",
    "the lateral interaction energies , on the other hand , can be determined with quite high accuracy , which we estimate for the present system to be around 60mev . comparing these interaction energies with those determined previously empirically and using the pairwise interaction approximation",
    "demonstrates that the latter assumption introduces an error that is at least as large as this remaining uncertainty when carefully determining the lateral interactions from present - day first - principles calculations .",
    "in order to describe the site - specific adsorption of oxygen atoms on the pd(100 ) surface we employ the concept of a lattice - gas hamiltonian , in which any system state is defined by the occupation of sites in a lattice , and the total free binding energy of any configuration is expanded into a sum of discrete interactions between the lattice sites ( see e.g. refs . ) . for a one component system with only one site type ,",
    "this energy reads ( with obvious generalizations to multi - site cases ) @xmath4 where the site occupation numbers @xmath5 = 0 or 1 indicate whether site @xmath6 in the lattice is empty or occupied , with a total of @xmath7 sites occupied , and @xmath8 is the free energy of an isolated species at the lattice site , including static and vibrational contributions",
    ". there are @xmath9 pair interactions with two - body ( or pair ) interaction energies @xmath10 between species at @xmath11th nearest neighbor sites , and @xmath12 trio interactions with @xmath13 three - body interaction energies .",
    "the sum labels @xmath14 [ and @xmath15 indicate that the sums run over all pairs of sites @xmath16 ( and three sites @xmath17 ) that are separated by @xmath11 lattice constants , and the summation is done such , that each pair ( or trio ) of occupied sites contributes exactly once to the lattice energy.@xcite    formally , higher and higher order interaction terms ( quattro , quinto , ... ) follow in the infinite expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eqlgh ] ) . in practice ,",
    "the expansion must ( and can ) be truncated after a finite number of terms . obviously , the judicious choice of which interactions to consider and which ones to neglect must critically affect the reliability of the entire approach . to quantify the impact of this choice on accuracy , we rely on the concept of leave - one - out cross validation ( loo - cv ) detailed below to identify the most important interactions out of a larger pool of possible interactions . figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the lateral interactions contained in this pool , which range from pair interactions up to the fifth nearest neighbor , via all trio interactions up to second nearest neighbor , to several compact quattro and one quinto interaction .",
    "the pool focuses thus on short- to medium - ranged interactions .",
    "interactions at larger distances can be substrate - mediated elastic or of electronic origin @xcite , but for the present system we do not expect such interactions to play a role on the accuracy level of interest to this study .      in order to generate a quantitatively accurate lgh , we parameterize the unknown lateral interaction energies contained in the lgh by first - principles calculations .",
    "the central quantities required for this parameterization are computed average free binding energies for a set of ordered configurations of o adsorbed at pd(100 ) .",
    "we write this average free binding energy as @xmath18 separating the total and vibrational contributions , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the former is defined as @xmath21 \\quad .",

    "since a free o@xmath26 molecule is thus used as the zero reference for @xmath19 , a positive binding energy indicates that the dissociative adsorption of o@xmath26 is exothermic at @xmath27k .    in order to determine the vibrational contribution to the average free binding we use the phonon density of states @xmath28 and",

    "the total energies required to evaluate eq .",

    "all surface structures are modeled in a supercell geometry , employing fully - relaxed symmetric slabs ( with o adsorption on both sides of the slab ) consisting of five ( 100 ) pd layers with an optimized bulk lattice constant of @xmath38 ( neglecting bulk zero - point vibrations ) .",
    "a vacuum region of @xmath39 ensures the decoupling of consecutive slabs .",
    "the lapw / apw+lo basis set parameters are listed as follows : muffin tin spheres for pd and o are @xmath40bohr and @xmath41bohr , respectively , the wave function expansion inside the muffin tin spheres is done up to @xmath42 , and the potential expansion up to @xmath43 .",

    "monkhorst - pack ( mp ) grids are used for the brillouin zone integrations .",
    "specifically , we use a @xmath46 grid for the calculation of @xmath47 surface unit - cells . for the larger surface cells",

    ", we exploit the relation @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the total energy of an isolated oxygen atom , and @xmath51 the theoretical o@xmath48 binding energy .",
    "the isolated o atom is then calculated spin - polarized , inside a rectangular cell of side lengths @xmath52bohr , @xmath53-point sampling of the brillouin zone and without spherically averaging the electron density in the open valence shell .",
    "for @xmath51 we employ the previously published ultra - converged gga - pbe value of @xmath54ev.@xcite    for the calculations of the adsorbate vibrational modes , the dynamical matrix is set up by displacing the o atom from its equilibrium position in 0.05 steps . anticipating a good decoupling of the vibrational modes due to the large mass difference between pd and o ,",
    "the positions of all atoms in the substrate below the adsorption site are kept fixed in these calculations .",
    "the frequencies and normal modes are then obtained by subsequent diagonalization of the dynamic matrix .",
    "once a reliable set of interactions has been established , evaluating the lgh for any configuration on the lattice corresponds merely to performing an algebraic sum over a finite number of terms , cf .",
    "( [ eqlgh ] ) . due to this simplicity",
    ", the lgh can be employed to evaluate the system partition function .",

    "metropolis sampling used 2000 mc passes per lattice site for equilibration , followed by 10000 mc passes per site for averaging the thermodynamic functions . increasing any of these numerical parameters led to identical results on the accuracy level of interest to this study , i.e. here primarily critical temperatures that are converged to within 5 - 10k .    for fixed coverage on the surface , ordered",
    "structures are identified by evaluating order parameters sensitive to lateral periodicities . to check on the @xmath57 periodicity of",

    ", the order parameter for the @xmath3 structure is defined as @xmath72 computing these order parameters as a function of temperature , the critical temperature for the order - disorder transition is defined by the inflection point where @xmath73 or @xmath74 go to zero . in parallel , we also derive the critical temperature from evaluating the specific heat , obtaining values that are identical to within 10k with those inferred from the order parameters .",
    ".[tab1 ] calculated binding energies @xmath19 ( in mev / o atom ) for o adsorption in on - surface hollow or bridge sites . the nomenclature and geometric arrangement in the surface unit - cell for the five ordered adlayers",
    "are explained in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the uncertainty introduced by the approximate xc functional can not be determined in a comparably quantitative manner as for the numerical approximations , since the exact functional is not known . in order to get at least a feeling for the scatter in the results",
    "when using different present - day xc functionals , we evaluated the lateral interactions also within the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite , which is a functional that by its very construction is known to yield significantly different adsorbate binding energies than the hitherto employed gga - pbe functional .",
    "most prominently , the two functionals yield e.g. binding energies for the free o@xmath48 molecule that differ by 1.35ev ( ! ) when computed with our accurate full - potential lapw / apw+lo scheme .",
    "all 24 dft input configurations were correspondingly calculated fully relaxed using the lda and the lda optimized lattice constant ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "using their energetics in the lgh expansion procedure , we obtain the lateral interaction energies compiled in table [ tab3 ] for the previously discussed optimum set with @xmath76 interaction figures .    comparing to the results obtained before using the gga - pbe as xc functional , also compiled in table [ tab3 ] , one clearly observes a similar pattern as before for the numerical uncertainties in the sense that the difference between the two xc functionals shows up predominantly in the on - site energy .",
    "in fact , the lateral pair , trio and quattro interactions are strikingly little affected , considering that the two xc functionals yield adsorbate binding energies that differ on the order of @xmath77ev . the reason is again as before , i.e. most of this variation arises out of the description of the free gas phase molecule , which affects all computed configurations alike and therefore solely enters the non - coverage dependent lgh parameter @xmath78 .",
    "the known larger variation of adsorbate binding energies when using different present - day xc functionals is often put forward as a generic argument against the reliability or usefulness of first - principles lateral interactions .",
    "at least for the present system , we can now qualify this concern .",
    "our analysis shows that the on - site energy can indeed not be determined with a high accuracy , cf .",
    "table [ tab3 ] .",
    "however , the lateral interactions themselves can be .",
    "for the o / pd(100 ) system , the uncertainty due to the approximate xc functional seems to be of the order of 50mev for the dominant pair interactions .",
    "the farther ranging and higher - order interaction terms in table [ tab3 ] exhibit intriguingly an even smaller scatter and we are currently pursuing further studies to elucidate the generality of this result .",
    "the largely different accuracy with which on - site energy and lateral interactions can be determined allows also to scrutinize when the first - principles parameters may be employed to reliably describe mesoscopic system quantities .",
    "we focus here on the effect of the approximate xc functional , since this leads to a larger uncertainty compared to the discussed treatment of the vibrational free energy contributions and the numerical inaccuracies in the total energies . since the on - site energy has no effect on the order - disorder transition in a canonic adsorbate ensemble , the small variation in the lateral interaction energies exhibited in table [ tab3 ] rationalizes the good agreement with the experimental critical temperatures .",
    "using the determined lda interaction values we indeed obtain a @xmath79 curve that is very similar to gga - pbe as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] : the overall shape of the curve including the peak structure is completely preserved , and the absolute @xmath80 values are merely shifted by up to 200k to higher temperatures .",
    "this variation may thus be taken as an indication of the accuracy with which this quantity can presently be calculated from first - principles .",
    "for other quantities , where the on - site energy enters explicitly , this accuracy will be significantly worse .",
    "staying with the presently available experimental data for the o / pd(100 ) system @xcite , this would e.g. be the case when aiming to compute the measured temperatures for oxygen desorption , where the on - site energy enters explicitly .",
    "one can , of course , always argue in terms of a smaller uncertainty by favoring a particular approximate xc functional over others ( e.g. because the functional is known to reproduce well similar system quantities ) . in the sense of first - principles",
    "theory , the more appropriate approach would , however , be to eliminate errors by using higher - level theory . in this respect",
    ", one could suitably exploit a finding like for the present system that most of the xc uncertainty gets concentrated in the on - site energy by e.g. computing only the latter with a higher - level technique ( or appropriate xc - correction scheme @xcite ) and using the already quite accurate lateral interactions determined by present - day xc functionals .",
    "instead of a first - principles determination , the traditional method to obtain the strengths of lateral interactions has been to adjust the predictions from atomistic lattice - gas models to experimental observations of the coverage and temperature dependence of on - surface ordering . to keep the number of free fit parameters low ,",
    "the focus has often been on pair interactions only , i.e. eq . ( [ eqlgh ] ) was truncated after the pair terms , and usually also only the dominant short - ranged pair interactions were considered . in this respect , extensive model studies @xcite have shown that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ordering frequently found at ( 100 ) cubic metal surfaces requires nearest neighbor repulsions that are so strong that they effectively yield a site exclusion ( @xmath81 ) , as well as weaker second nearest neighbor repulsions . in order to produce a true @xmath2 ordering further interactions are required .",
    "this can either be a third nearest neighbor attraction , or a fourth nearest neighbor repulsion , or more generally a combination of these interactions that fulfills @xmath82.@xcite    comparing with our first - principles data compiled in table [ tab3 ] , we see that they perfectly fit into this expected qualitative pattern : strong first nearest neighbor repulsion , weaker second nearest neighbor repulsion , and the combination @xmath83 is attractive .",
    "however , differences arise when turning to a more detailed modeling of the experimental o / pd(100 ) phase diagram of chang and thiel @xcite . for a lattice - gas model considering nearest - neighbor site exclusion and",
    "finite second and third nearest neighbor interactions , liu and evans showed that the best overall topological agreement with the experimental phase diagram is achieved for @xmath84.@xcite in particular , the position of the disordered to @xmath3-o transition line shifts notably with the ratio of @xmath85 , and for a ratio of @xmath86 the @xmath79 curve no longer exhibits the peak structure at @xmath87ml visible in the first - principles curve in fig .",
    "since this resembles the shape of the experimental curve better , it could indicate that the calculated first - principles ratio of @xmath88 is too large . on the other hand , it is intriguing to see that both lda and gga - pbe yield roughly the same @xmath85 ratio and in turn clearly a peak in the @xmath79 curve , cf .",
    "since chang and thiel discuss also a rather large uncertainty of @xmath89ml in their experimental coverage calibration @xcite , a careful remeasurement of the experimental @xmath79 curve would thus be very interesting to fully settle this point .",
    "a much more fundamental difference between the set of empirical and first - principles lateral interactions is that the former is restricted to just pairwise interactions . to test the validity of this frequently applied approximation",
    ", we restrict our lgh expansion to pair interactions up to third nearest neighbors and repeat the parameterization using exactly the same 24 dft configurations as in section iiib .",
    "the resulting interactions are also compiled in table [ tab3 ] , using the lda or gga - pbe as xc functional .",
    "comparing with the values obtained for each functional from the proper lgh expansion ( and using exactly the same first - principles input ) , we note significant differences .",
    "the dominant short - ranged interactions are overestimated , in the case of the first nearest neighbor pair interaction by @xmath90mev .",
    "overall , the lateral interactions are too repulsive , which is a consequence of them having to mimic the effect of the neglected overall repulsive trio interactions .",
    "as expected , the true microscopic lateral interactions are thus blurred by spurious contributions arising from the invalid assumption that lateral interactions at metal surfaces could be expressible in pair - only terms .",
    "the invalidity of this assumption is already clearly demonstrated by the similar magnitude of the dominant trio interactions ( @xmath91 , etc . in table [ tab3 ] ) compared to the dominant short - ranged pair interactions , which necessarily reduces pair - only restricted expansions to a set of _ effective _ parameters at best .",
    "the deficiencies introduced by such an effective description are not only the lack of microscopic meaning of the lateral interactions themselves , but also errors in the mesoscopic system properties calculated with these interactions .",
    "this is again exemplified for the order - disorder transition in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , which shows that the @xmath79 curve derived from the pair - only lateral interactions in table [ tab3 ] differs notably from the curve derived from the corresponding proper lgh expanded lateral interactions .",
    "the critical temperatures are up to 350k higher , even though being based on exactly the same first - principles energetics .",
    "the shortcomings due to the restricted lgh can also not be overcome , when turning to a completely empirical approach and adjusting the lateral interaction values to reproduce experiment . within the above described lattice - gas model with pair interactions to third nearest neighbor and fitting to the critical temperatures in the coverage range below 0.25ml , liu and evans determined @xmath92mev @xcite , i.e. lateral interactions that differ considerably from the first - principles values compiled in table [ tab3 ] . as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , these empirical parameters do indeed lead to an excellent fit of the experimental @xmath79 curve in the coverage range up to 0.25ml .",
    "however , outside the fitted coverage range , the effective description rapidly breaks down and predicts a critical temperature curve in qualitative disagreement with experiment .",
    "already at a coverage of 0.35ml , i.e. only 0.1ml outside the fitted coverage range , the predicted critical temperature for the order - disorder transition is wrong by 1200k .",
    "the spurious contributions contained in the effective pair interactions also prohibit a systematic determination of which pairwise interactions to consider . in the systematic lgh expansion detailed in section iiib , the lateral interactions are chosen out of a larger pool of lateral interactions and the ultimately determined pair interactions decrease in magnitude with distance .",
    "in contrast , when we extend the pair - only expansion to include the fourth and fifth nearest neighbor interaction , we obtain a negligible @xmath93 of -2mev , but a @xmath94 of -18mev .",
    "the spurious contributions contained in the effective @xmath94 thus feign that such far ranging interactions are significant , whereas the proper first - principles lgh expansion shows no significant interactions between adsorbates at distances larger than the fourth nearest neighbor site . in empirical approaches this uncertainty ( or degree of arbitrariness ) as to which interactions to consider is even further aggravated , since there are typically several sets of pairwise interactions which equally well fit the less stringent mesoscopic ordering behavior .",
    "in summary , we have presented a first - principles lattice - gas hamiltonian study of the on - surface ordering behavior of o adatoms at the pd(100 ) surface .",
    "a key feature of the approach is the systematics of the lgh expansion , both with respect to the selection of the considered lateral interactions and with respect to the ordered configurations , the dft energetics of which is employed in the parameterization .",
    "in contrast to empirical or semi - empirical _ ad hoc _ parameterizations the approach does provide an error - controlled link between the electronic structure regime and the system s mesoscopic ensemble properties . carefully scrutinizing the approximations entering at the level of the underlying dft energetics , at the lgh interface and in the statistical simulations , we identify the approximate exchange - correlation functional employed to obtain the dft energetics as the major source of uncertainty in the approach .",
    "this uncertainty affects predominantly the on - site energy , and only to a much lesser degree the lateral interactions themselves . comparing lda and gga exchange - correlation functionals",
    ", we estimate the accuracy of the latter to be within @xmath90mev for the present system .",
    "this shows that the known much larger variation of adsorbate binding energies with different xc functionals can not be used to uncritically question the reliability or usefulness of lateral interactions derived from first - principles _ per se_.    the rather high accuracy of the first - principles lateral interactions also rationalizes the obtained good agreement with the experimental low coverage phase diagram for the o / pd(100 ) system , i.e. the ground state ordered structures and critical temperatures for the order - disorder transition .",
    "an important feature of the set of lateral interactions is that it contains many - body interactions of comparable magnitude to the dominant short - ranged pair interactions .",
    "this demonstrates the invalidity of the assumption of exclusively pairwise interactions between adsorbates at metal surfaces that is frequently applied in empirical approaches .",
    "indeed , when restricting the lgh expansion to just pairwise lateral interactions , we find that this results in effective interactions which contain spurious contributions that are of equal size , if not larger than any of the uncertainties e.g. due to the approximate xc functional . these effective parameters lack microscopic meaning and lead to uncontrolled errors in the mesoscopic system properties calculated with them . in the present system , this is illustrated clearly by critical temperatures that are up to 350k higher than the ones obtained with the proper set of lateral interactions , even though both sets were based on exactly the same first - principles energetics .",
    "we conclude that at least for the present system , an appropriate first - principles statistical mechanics framework and present - day dft energetics can determine lateral interactions at least as reliably as the traditional empirical approaches , and without suffering from the non - uniqueness in the selection of pairwise - additive adspecies interactions which reasonably fit available data .",
