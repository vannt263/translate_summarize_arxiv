    "stochastic processes with nonlinear dissipation are ubiquitous and challenging to describe theoretically .",
    "mathematical difficulties related to the nonlinearity of a corresponding stochastic differential equation are only part of the problem .",
    "a more subtle challenge is to establish fluctuation - dissipation relations which , in contrast to linear processes , can not be phenomenologically justified  @xcite . instead , a truly dynamical approach is usually needed when the dissipation force and statistical properties of the noise are deduced directly from underlying dynamics , rather than postulated _",
    "ad hoc_. conventional assumptions of a phenomenological approach in the context of nonlinear response may be misleading .",
    "for instance , the assumption of gaussian random force in the langevin equation leads to the fokker - planck equation of second order , regardless of whether the dissipation force is linear or not . on the other hand ,",
    "a kinetic approach leads to the second - order fokker - planck equation for a brownian particle only in the lowest order of a perturbation technique , while in general the equation involves derivatives of order higher than two  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear stochastic processes are usually associated with far - from - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "if a system is close to equilibrium , nonlinear dissipation usually appears as small corrections to the dominating linear friction and in many cases may be safely neglected . however , under certain circumstances , the contribution of linear terms may vanish identically or be strongly reduced . then nonlinear dissipative effects come into the limelight and give rise to a variety of new physical effects .",
    "an example , which has received particular attention in recent years , is the rectification of thermal fluctuations in the so - called adiabatic piston problem  @xcite .",
    "the problem concerns brownian motion of a piston which separates a gas - filled cylinder into two compartments with different temperatures and gas densities . if the pressure on both sides of the piston is the same , the linear theory predicts zero average velocity of the piston , while the correct result is that the piston acquires a systematic average speed in the direction of the compartment with higher temperature . the effect may be readily explained using the langevin equation with a small nonlinear correction , quadratic in the piston s velocity , to the dissipative force  @xcite .",
    "some other effects related to the nonlinear dissipation are discussed in  @xcite .    in the adiabatic piston problem the fluctuation - induced drift originates from nonequilibrium and asymmetry .",
    "the current point of view is that these two ingredients are necessary in general for rectification of thermal fluctuations , i.e. for the physical realization of maxwell s demon .",
    "asymmetry may be introduced by surroundings , as in the adiabatic piston problem , or by the geometry of the brownian particle itself  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "our concern is a transient rectification effect originating from asymmetric initial conditions .",
    "of the ensemble is zero , but the higher moments @xmath0 are finite . ]",
    "consider an ensemble of non - interacting brownian particles diffusing in one dimension .",
    "the particles are identical but may have different initial velocities .",
    "suppose the distribution of initial velocities @xmath1 is similar to fig . 1 : asymmetric but in such a way that the average initial velocity of the ensemble is zero , @xmath2 the question is whether @xmath3 for later time @xmath4 is positive , negative or zero ?",
    "contrary to its apparent simplicity , the question requires going beyond the standard theory of brownian motion based on the linear langevin equation and the corresponding second - order fokker - planck equation .",
    "both approaches give the linear relaxation law @xmath5 , and therefore predict that if the average velocity @xmath3 is zero initially , it remains so later on .",
    "the prediction is incorrect as one can see from the result of numerical experiment presented in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 . on the time scale of order",
    "@xmath6 , a finite average velocity develops in the direction corresponding to the higher , narrower wing of the initial distribution , the right wing in fig .",
    "the particles moving to the right , have lower average initial speeds but are more numerous and give a larger contribution to @xmath3 than the particles moving to the left .",
    "the victory of the larger team of slower runners does not last very long : after reaching a peak at roughly one half of @xmath7 , the function @xmath3 decays exponentially with the characteristic time of order @xmath7 . yet , this transient time may be sufficiently long to cause measurable physical consequences .",
    "the problem may be considered as an idealized model of the dissociation of a complex system in a viscous medium . among possible relevant fields",
    "are the coulomb fragmentation of multiply - charged clusters and droplets  @xcite and processes involving fragmentation of complex molecular aggregates , such as protein - ligand dissociation  @xcite .",
    "if the system is initially at rest and all dissociated fragments have the same mass , eq .",
    "( [ symmetry ] ) is just the condition of conservation of total momentum . for a system in vacuum ,",
    "the speed of the center of mass of fragments remains zero after dissociation .",
    "however if dissociation happens in a viscous medium , the average velocity is temporarily finite , and the center of mass changes position even if the fragments are identical and have the same diffusion coefficients .    to account for this transient rectification effect",
    ", one has to take into account that the equation for the first moment of the velocity @xmath5 is closed only in lowest order in the small parameter @xmath8 , the mass ratio of a molecule ( @xmath9 ) to a brownian particle ( @xmath10 ) . at higher orders in @xmath11 , the first moment @xmath3",
    "is coupled to the moments of higher orders @xmath12 . if initially the first moment is zero , but the higher moments are finite , as for the initial distribution in fig .",
    "1 , then @xmath13 for @xmath4 . to describe the problem quantitatively",
    ", one may adopt the approach based on either the langevin equation for @xmath14 or the fokker - planck equation for the distribution function @xmath15 . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss both approaches and outline details of the numerical simulations presented in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "the microscopic derivation of the langevin equation beyond the lowest order in @xmath16 was discussed recently in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we outline the results and apply them to our problem .",
    "an appropriate perturbation technique is guided by anticipation that the velocity @xmath17 of a brownian particle is typically about @xmath11 times that of a molecule of the surrounding bath .",
    "this suggests working with the scaled velocity of the particle @xmath18 , which is expected to be of the same order as the thermal velocity of molecules @xmath19 , @xmath20 the microscopic equation of motion for the scaled velocity @xmath21 ( or for the scaled momentum @xmath22 ) involves the small parameter @xmath11 explicitly , and therefore is convenient for a perturbation analysis .",
    "the equation is coupled with bath degrees of freedom which may be `` projected out '' with an appropriate projection operator technique  @xcite . as a result , to lowest order in @xmath11 , one obtains the conventional linear langevin equation @xmath23 where the zero - centered fluctuating force @xmath24 is related to the dissipation constant @xmath25 through the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath26 the linear langevin equation ( [ le1 ] ) leads to the following equations for the velocity moments  @xcite @xmath27 as discussed , these equations , obtained in lowest order in @xmath28 , are not sufficient for our purpose : the closed equation for the first moment @xmath29 clearly can not account for the behavior presented in fig .",
    "the next approximation for the langevin equation involves a correction of order @xmath30 and , for a homogeneous bath , has the form  @xcite @xmath31 besides the presence of the nonlinear dissipative term @xmath32 , this equation differs from the linear one ( [ le1 ] ) by a higher order correction to the linear damping , and the fluctuating force @xmath33 the explicit form of these corrections is not necessary for the purpose of this paper .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation relation for the nonlinear dissipation coefficient @xmath34 involves rather complicated correlation functions  @xcite , and to the best of our knowledge , can not be established phenomenologically .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdt ] ) for the linear dissipation coefficient @xmath25 which can be obtained using the prediction of equilibrium statistics @xmath35 in the long time limit .",
    "since the fluctuating force is zero - centered to any order in @xmath11 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ le2 ] ) that to order @xmath30 the first moment is coupled to the third one , @xmath36 one has to substitute here @xmath37 obtained in the lowest order in @xmath11 which according to ( [ moments ] ) satisfies the equation @xmath38 our interest is the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath39 clearly , in this case @xmath40 , so that the last term in the eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) can be neglected .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) and recalling that @xmath42 , one obtains @xmath43 recall also that @xmath44 is the scaled velocity , @xmath21 . for the true velocity @xmath17",
    "the result formally does not involve the small factor @xmath28 , @xmath45 however , one should keep in mind that the whole procedure applied above implies that @xmath46 .",
    "this puts a constraint on the the width @xmath47 of the initial distribution @xmath1 , @xmath48 under this constraint @xmath49 is small and can not exceed order @xmath50 .    for a far - from - equilibrium ensemble the above theory , strictly speaking , is not applicable . yet , as one observes from fig .",
    "( [ sol ] ) predicts qualitatively correct behavior also for a `` hot '' initial distribution with @xmath51 . in these cases",
    "the first moment given by eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) is not small , @xmath52 .",
    "according to the result ( [ sol ] ) , the first moment @xmath3 reaches the maximum at time @xmath53 where @xmath54 , which is seen in fig . 2 to be in agreement with numerical simulation .",
    "to make more qualitative predictions , one needs an explicit expression for the ratio of the dissipative coefficients @xmath55 , which is the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) . since a general result for",
    "this ratio is unknown , in the rest of the paper we discuss a specific model of brownian motion - the rayleigh model - for which our numerical experiment is carried out , and for which analytical results are available .    in the original rayleigh model  @xcite ,",
    "a heavy brownian particle moves in one dimension interacting with bath molecules through instantaneous elastic collisions , while molecules do not interact with one another at all .",
    "for this model the fokker - planck equation for the distribution function @xmath15 can be readily obtained , as will be discussed in the next section . however , due to the singular character of the hard - wall potential , the derivation of a nonlinear langevin equation for the original rayleigh model is not quite straightforward .",
    "one may instead to work with a generalized rayleigh model where the particle interacts with molecules through a continuous repulsive potential . for a low density of bath molecules ( when multiple collision are negligible ) and for the time scale",
    "longer than the collision time @xmath56 , the original and generalized models are expected to give the same results . using the generalized rayleigh model ,",
    "one obtains the following explicit expressions for the dissipative coefficients  @xcite @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the concentration of molecules , @xmath59 is the particle s cross - section , and @xmath60 is the thermal velocity of molecules in the bath .",
    "it is tempting to assume that the relation @xmath61 which follows from ( [ gammas ] ) , is in fact general but we leave this conjecture for further studies . substituting ( [ ratio ] ) into eq .",

    "2 by dashed lines , is in good agreement with numerical simulation as long as the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) on the initial distribution is satisfied . before discussing details of the simulation ,",
    "let us derive the results using the language of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "for the original rayleigh model , which involves only binary - particle molecule collisions , the fokker - planck equation can be readily obtained using the kramers - moyal expansion of the master equation  @xcite . to order @xmath28",
    ", the equation has a familiar form @xmath64 where the second order differential operator @xmath65 reads @xmath66 and @xmath25 is given by ( [ gammas ] ) .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) derived from the nonlinear langevin equation .",
    "therefore , the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpe2 ] ) gives the same results as the nonlinear langevin equation  ( [ le2 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the langevin equation  ( [ le2 ] ) is derived directly from the liouville equation  @xcite and is more general than the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpe2 ] ) , which is obtained under the assumption of binary particle - molecule collisions .",
    "in our molecular dynamics simulation , we use the generalized rayleigh model in which the brownian particle moves in one dimension interacting with molecules through a finite - range repulsive parabolic potential , while molecules do not interact with one another . in this model ,",
    "discussed in detail in @xcite , the particle - molecule collision time @xmath56 is finite and does not depend on the velocity of the molecule .",
    "a characteristic parameter of the model is @xmath72 , which is an average number of molecules simultaneously interacting with the particle . in simulation ,",
    "the linear molecular density @xmath73 was chosen to make @xmath74 of order 1 . in this case ,",
    "multiple particle - molecule collisions are rare , and one can expect that the result should be close to that for the original rayleigh model with instantaneous binary collisions .    to mimic unbounded diffusion of a particle , we have used two sources of molecules located far from the particle that generate a bath with a maxwellian velocity distribution and a constant density . the first condition is easily accommodated by selecting incoming molecule velocities from the boltzmann distribution @xmath75 while controlling the rate of molecule generation with a poisson process is one possibility that is consistent with the second condition .",
    "with such a velocity distribution , the total flux at each source is @xmath76 .",
    "the poisson distribution for the period between molecule injections is then @xmath77 , which will maintain an average linear density of @xmath73 around the particle .",
