    "a well known difficulty in fuelling active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is that the typical angular momentum of gas in the galactic bulge is very large compared with that of the last stable orbit around a black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the bulge is the reservoir ultimately supplying mass to the nucleus , the result is presumably a disc with the size of a fraction of the bulge radius , i.e. , a fraction of a kiloparsec .",
    "the material at the inner edge of the disc would then have to give up its angular momentum rapidly enough to be able to lower itself in the smbh potential well .",
    "this can perhaps be done through the action of stellar and gaseous bars and other gravitational torques ( e.e .",
    ".    however , there is no clear observational evidence for a link between agn activity and the presence of `` grand design '' gas discs or stellar bars @xcite . a further theoretical impasse for large scale gaseous discs",
    "is that even if material does reach the inner parsec scales , theory predicts that these discs are too cold and too massive , and thus should be unstable to gravitational fragmentation and star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "for smbh feeding , star formation is a disease that threatens the very existence of accretion discs outside the `` self - gravity radius '' , @xmath3 pc @xcite .",
    "if gaseous discs are turned into stellar discs , smbhs can not grow by gas accretion .",
    "faced with these and other theoretical difficulties , @xcite and @xcite suggested that agn many may be fed by a direct deposition of low angular material into the region @xmath4 .",
    "the main difficulty for this suggestion is that the specific angular momentum of the orbit at @xmath5 is only @xmath6 pc km / s , much smaller than the more typical @xmath7 pc km / s at @xmath8 pc .    on the other hand , the smbh mass , though large ,",
    "is only a tiny fraction(@xmath9 ) of the stellar mass of the bulge @xcite , and must be an even smaller fraction of the original gaseous mass from which the bulge is made .",
    "it thus seems not impossible that cloud - cloud collisions , supernova shocks , and galaxy mergers channel such a small fraction of bulge gas on nearly radial orbits ending up inside @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , a quantitative treatment of these processes would be very model - dependent and hardly constraining .",
    "in this paper we note that gas feeding the smbh does not actually need to have such a small angular momentum after all .",
    "we propose that smbhs can be fed by clouds with angular momentum an order of magnitude higher , i.e. @xmath10 pc km / s or more , if there is significant cancellation of angular momentum by shocks in the smbh s vicinity .",
    "this would happen if the angular momentum of the clouds is random .",
    "below we show that such a picture predicts the formation of a warped accretion disc that can be much larger than @xmath11 , and we discuss observational implications for current observations of agn and for the smbh - galaxy connection .",
    "we feel that this `` stochastic cloud '' mode of smbh fuelling has numerous advantages over the `` grand design '' models .",
    "@xcite presented the most complete and up - to - date consideration of gravitational stability of different accretion disc models .",
    "the standard accretion flow model is gravitationally unstable beyond the self - gravity radius @xmath12 , which is a function of the accretion rate in the disc , @xmath13 .",
    "a rough power - law fit to this dependence from figure 1 in @xcite is @xmath14 where @xmath13 is in units of @xmath15  year@xmath16 . for",
    "astrophysically interesting accretion rates , then , @xmath17  pc .",
    "@xcite also found that none of the more sophisticated models avoids becoming self - gravitating at parsec - scale distances from the smbh , unless an unspecified and very large energy source is applied to the disc to keep it hot enough .",
    "the required energy at 10 pc , for example , was at least that expected if all of the disc material was reprocessed by massive stars .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that even if a source for this energy was found , the disc may still be thermally unstable as the cooling times were much shorter than the local dynamical time .",
    "furthermore , @xcite demonstrated that such a high energy liberation rate near an agn is actually in conflict with the observed spectra of typical agn .",
    "@xcite proposed a starburst disc model which appears to overcome the difficulties noted by @xcite .",
    "these authors suggested parameterising the radial inflow velocity at a fraction of the disc sound speed , arguing that external torques or spiral density waves may deliver the required angular momentum transfer .",
    "this makes these discs lighter at a given accretion rate .",
    "additionally , thompson et al.s star formation rate in the disc is limited by the action of energy and momentum feedback from massive stars and supernovae , allowing some fuel to trickle down all the way to the nucleus .    without numerical analysis",
    "it is difficult to say whether this model will work for parsec - scale agn discs .",
    "one problem is that of time scales .",
    "gravitational collapse of the disc is expected to take place on the dynamical time scale , @xmath18 @xcite show that the disc cooling time is much shorter than the dynamical time in their model .",
    "on the other hand , the lifetime of massive stars is at least a few million years .",
    "therefore , the supernovae contribution to the feedback might be activated too slowly in this model , i.e. , only when the disc would already have collapsed gravitationally .",
    "feedback due to radiation and outflows from massive stars may appear much faster , perhaps as quickly as required by equation [ tdyn ] .",
    "however it is not obvious that the feedback will be spread uniformly enough in the disc . for",
    "a disk of scale height @xmath19 , radiation and outflows from a massive star would affect a surface area of size @xmath20 only .",
    "thus , to heat up the whole disc , @xmath21 massive stars are required .",
    "if we assume that one massive star forms from @xmath22 of gaseous material for a @xcite imf , this would require disc mass of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding star formation rate would be @xmath25  year@xmath26 .",
    "this seems to be too high for the central region of only a few parsecs .",
    "in addition , analytical estimates @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite show that the stellar component of star forming discs decouples vertically from the gaseous disc when the total stellar mass becomes comparable to the gas mass .",
    "since gas cools radiatively and stellar motions do not , stellar discs become more vertically extended , as in the galactic disc in solar neighbourhood . feedback in massive star - dominated discs in agn",
    "would thus occur mainly outside the gaseous disc , diminishing the efficiency of feedback deposition further .",
    "summarising , there does not appear to be a completely convincing way to avoid the self - gravity catastrophe for parsec - scale _ massive _ agn discs .",
    "the fundamental problem is that these discs are very inefficient as far as angular momentum transfer is concerned .",
    "they need to be massive enough to provide a high enough rate of smbh feeding , yet they can not be hot enough to escape fragmentation .",
    "the simplest conclusion one can draw from this is that while such discs are probably very important for transferring huge amounts of gas into the inner parts of galaxies , they probably fail to fuel smbhs .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      figure 1 illustrates the schematics of the model we would like to explore here .",
    "we assume that during the epoch of bulge and smbh growth , the gaseous medium feeding both of these can be crudely divided into two components ( left panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "the first is the dominant part of the gas with non - negligible angular momentum .",
    "this component forms a large scale gaseous disc that mainly forms stars for the reasons explained in  [ sec : problems ] .",
    "the second component is a less massive quasi - spherical one .",
    "a key assumption we make here is that these two components do not mix completely , or else we would only have the gaseous disc .",
    "this immediately implies that the quasi - spherical component must be in the form of compact clouds .",
    "we reason further that there will be continuous production of clouds on nearly radial trajectories through cloud - cloud collisions , their gravitational scattering off each other or off star clusters , supernova driven shock waves , etc .",
    "we now consider the structure of the inner accretion flow assuming that these nearly radial clouds provide the dominant mechanism of smbh feeding .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 zooms in on the inner parsecs of the model .",
    "let @xmath27 be the radius of the sphere centred on the smbh that is `` optically thick '' to a typical gas cloud .",
    "clouds collide , convert their bulk kinetic energy into heat which is radiated away rapidly , and become bound to the smbh inside this region . the lower limit on @xmath27 is given by the geometrical size of the infalling clouds themselves , as the different sides of the cloud then collide with each other . observed interstellar clouds form structures on a range of scales , but scales of few parsec are most common @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that @xmath28  pc .",
    "the angular momentum of the clouds at @xmath27 is at most the local circular orbital value , @xmath29 .",
    "as clouds collide , they circularise and settle into a disc .",
    "the outer radius of the disc , @xmath30 , is smaller than @xmath27 , and is controlled by the degree to which angular momentum is cancelled in these collisions .    to estimate it ,",
    "define @xmath31 as the average rate of number of clouds entering the collision sphere @xmath32 .",
    "the angular momentum of the material entering the sphere is then , by random walk arguments , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "suppose that the collision sphere is within the black hole sphere of influence , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "in that case the outer edge of the disc is given by @xmath37 obviously , in the limit of @xmath38 , we get @xmath39 , as expected in the case of a zero angular momentum inflow .",
    "the agn disc we consider has a very unusual feeding mode as the angular momentum of the material supplied to the disc fluctuates with arrival of new clouds .",
    "unlike binary roche lobe overflow systems , the geometry is 3d , with new material arriving not necessarily at the outer edge . in particular , parts of clouds with particularly low angular momentum might strike the disc further in than @xmath30 . in a clear difference from the standard accretion flow",
    ", no angular momentum transport is needed in such randomly fed discs to promote accretion .",
    "cancellation of the randomly directed angular momentum of the new material and that of the disc sets up a radial inflow .",
    "we call this `` forced accretion '' as it is mediated by external deposition of material .",
    "let us estimate the steady - state mass of such a disc .",
    "the specific angular momentum of a disc containing @xmath40 equal mass clouds that arrived with a random direction of the angular momentum will be @xmath41 , again by random walk arguments .",
    "if this angular momentum is less than @xmath42 , the disc will move in radially ( in this very simple picture ) to @xmath4 .",
    "thus , @xmath43 random cloud deposition events are needed to lower the gas to @xmath4 region .",
    "accordingly , the `` stochastic average '' mass of the disc will be @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass of a cloud .",
    "for example , if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 .",
    "the accretion time scale is given by the expression @xmath49    in a quasi steady state , the surface density profile , @xmath50 , is a strongly peaked function for these discs .",
    "we have , const@xmath51 .",
    "as @xmath52 is independent of radius , we obtain @xmath53 .",
    "this is a much steeper dependence than that for discs in which surface density is regulated by angular momentum transfer , since viscous time typically is a strongly increasing function of radius .",

    "we can estimate the maximum outer radius of the externally forced discs .",
    "requiring that the time scale for a significant angular momentum change @xmath70 to be larger than the local dynamical time given by equation [ tdyn ] , we see that the disc can not be larger than about 10 pc .",
    "another way to put this result is to say that any disc larger than this will necessarily be star forming .      at small radii ,",
    "the viscous time is shorter than @xmath52 . within that region ,",
    "the inflow is viscous rather than externally driven .",
    "the inner radius of the forced discs can thus be estimated as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the aspect ratio of the inner disc .",
    "this is an estimate only , as hydrogen ionisation instability might in principle be important for this region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and modulate the accretion rate onto the smbh .    lodato & pringle ( 2007 ) show that , in a diffusive regime , warp propagation occurs on a time scale shorter than the viscous time by a factor @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the `` warp diffusion viscosity coefficient '' .",
    "they find that @xmath74 has a maximum value of a few which is attained for strongly warped accretion discs .",
    "hence , in the context of our model , the inner region of radial size @xmath75 is able to flatten out due to local viscous forces .",
    "the inner flow then consists of the innermost zone ( @xmath76 ) where the flow is flat and viscosity mediates the inflow , and the outer zone ( @xmath77 ) , where the disc is also flat but the inflow is driven by the same mechanism as in the larger forced disc .",
    "the orientation of the inner disc @xmath78 coincides with the that of the innermost part of the larger forced disc .",
    "note that @xmath79 sets a velocity scale  the kepler velocity at that radius  of @xmath80  few  @xmath81 km s@xmath16 .",
    "since the inner disc is flat , it presents a very small solid angle to the agn illumination . on the other hand",
    ", the outer disc might be much better exposed to the agn .",
    "it is then possible that the transition between the inner flat and the outer warped disc will be a site for broad agn optical and uv lines .",

    "<S> this may help explain the high efficiency with which it seems to be operating in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> ( vi ) no correlation between smbh activity and the presence of kiloparsec scale bars or gaseous discs in galactic bulges ; ( vii ) bodily collisions between gaseous components of merging galaxies facilitate production of gas streams feeding the centre of the combined galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> mergers should thus be catalysts of smbh growth . </S>",
    "<S> ( viii ) conversely , galaxies experiencing fewer mergers are more likely to form massive nuclear star clusters than feed their smbhs .    </S>",
