    "droplets in turbulent flows occur in variety of industrial processes such as sprays , colloid mills , and mixers . when the droplet diameter are smaller than the dissipative scales of turbulence , one can approximate them as point particles whose dynamics is governed by the maxey - riley - gatignol equations @xcite .",
    "several numerical , analytical , and experimental studies have studied this regime and found interesting phenomena such as clustering of particles at small and large scales  @xcite . when the diameter of the droplet is larger than the dissipative scales of turbulence , the point particle approximation is no longer valid .",

    "using kolmogorov theory for velocity differences @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy dissipation rate , hinze showed , in his 1955 seminal work @xcite , that the maximum droplet diameter that does not undergo breakup is given by criterion : @xmath9 where the coefficient @xmath10 is obtained by fitting with experimental data .",
