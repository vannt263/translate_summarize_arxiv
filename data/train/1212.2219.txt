    "ultracold atomic and molecular gases in optical lattices provide a unique playground for investigating quantum many - body phenomena @xcite . since the seminal experiment by greiner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it has become common in such experiments to study quantum phase transitions in the presence of strong correlations . in particular , optical lattice realizations of the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xmath3 have been shown to undergo a transition from a superfluid to a mott - insulator as the ratio of @xmath4 is increased in different dimensions @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we set @xmath5 and @xmath6 , so that @xmath7 is measured in units of @xmath8 and time @xmath9 is measured in units of @xmath10 .",
    "we also set the lattice spacing @xmath11 , thus length is measured in units of @xmath12 .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bhm , the focus of this study , is of particular interest because of the dominant role played by quantum fluctuations . from the theoretical side",
    ", it is challenging to accurately determine the critical value @xmath13 at which the system at constant density undergoes a superfluid  mott - insulator transition , something that , due to the lack of exact solutions for this model , is typically done utilizing computational approaches @xcite . here",
    ", the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) universality class of the transition makes calculations in finite systems susceptible to large finite - size effects .",
    "insights from luttinger liquid theory , combined with density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) @xcite calculations of correlation functions and extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit , have provided some of the most accurate values of @xmath13 to date @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . due to",
    "the large numerical effort needed , alternative and more accurate scaling approaches to calculate @xmath13 , which do not rely on computing correlation functions , are highly desirable . from the experimental point of view , many of the quantities used in theoretical studies to determine @xmath13 are either difficult ( e.g , the gap @xcite ) or not possible to measure accurately .",
    "the task is complicated even further by inhomogeneities induced by the unavoidable confining potentials present  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is also highly desirable to find approaches to determine @xmath13 that could be more easily implemented in experiments .    in this work ,",
    "we address the two issues mentioned above , namely , how to accurately determine @xmath13 within computational approaches and in experimental studies .",
    "first , we apply a recently proposed scaling approach for the gap @xcite to obtain the critical point in the bhm with high accuracy and at fillings @xmath14 .",
    "second , we investigate the behavior of the fidelity susceptibility across these transitions .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility , a quantity motivated from the field of quantum information , has recently attracted much attention as a means of identifying the presence of quantum phase transitions even if the nature of the involved phases is not known @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss how to determine @xmath13 by studying the center - of - mass motion during bloch oscillations , which occur after tilting the lattice @xcite .",
    "this is something that can be easily implemented in ultracold gases experiments .",
    "all equilibrium calculations are done utilizing dmrg and , out - of - equilibrium , the krylov variant of the adaptive time - dependent dmrg ( t - dmrg ) @xcite . for ground state calculations ,",
    "we perform 10 sweeps and keep up to @xmath15 density - matrix eigenstates . in order to ensure the high accuracy needed for the considerations below , we truncate the local hilbert space at @xmath16 bosons ( where @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) .",
    "the ground state energies obtained are converged in most cases with an absolute accuracy of @xmath19 or better .",
    "the computation of the fidelity susceptibility is , however , more demanding , and we are restricted to smaller systems . in order to reach the necessary accuracy in the overlap of the two wave functions involved , we use @xmath20 . to study the out - of - equilibrium dynamics under a tilt",
    ", we truncate the local hilbert space at @xmath21 bosons and keep up to @xmath22 states in the course of the time evolution while using a time step of @xmath23 .",
    "the phase transition from a mott insulator to a superfluid in the 1d bhm at commensurate fillings is known to be of bkt type @xcite .",
    "hence , it is accompanied by the exponential closing of the single - particle gap @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is a parameter which is independent of @xmath7 ) . as a consequence of its exponential behavior , a direct study of the transition by computing the single - particle gap for finite systems is plagued by finite - size effects .",
    "this problem can be overcome by a scaling analysis of the gap , for which we follow the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , briefly described below .",
    "the method is based on the following ansatz for the scaling of the gap in the vicinity of the phase transition , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a scaling function , @xmath28 is an unknown constant to be determined , and @xmath29 is the system size .",
    "we emphasize two aspects of this scaling ansatz : first , it contains the logarithmic corrections that are typical for @xmath30 at the bkt transition @xcite .",
    "second , it resembles the relation for the resistance ( which also vanishes exponentially ) in the charge - unbinding transition of the two - dimensional classical coulomb gas , which is also of bkt type @xcite . at the critical point , and in its vicinity within the superfluid region , one expects the values of @xmath31 to be system - size independent because of the divergence of the correlation length .",
    "hence , the data for the rescaled gap @xmath32 $ ] for different system sizes @xmath29 will be independent of @xmath29 in this region .",
    "furthermore , the curves @xmath33 vs @xmath34 for several values of @xmath29 and @xmath7 should collapse onto a unique curve representing @xmath27 .",
    "equivalently , one can reformulate the relation in eq .   by taking the logarithm of the argument of @xmath27 and considering a different function @xmath35 with argument @xmath36 .",
    "we determine the critical point by adjusting the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath25 , and @xmath28 . in the procedure",
    ", we look for the best collapse of the curves @xmath33 vs @xmath37 for different values of @xmath7 and @xmath29 .",
    "this is done by representing the function @xmath35 with a selected high - degree polynomial ( eighth degree in our case ) such that the results are independent of the degree .",
    "such polynomial is fit on a dense grid of values of @xmath13 , @xmath25 , and @xmath28 , to the calculated values of @xmath33 and @xmath37 .",
    "the quality of the fit is assessed by computing the sum of squared residuals ( @xmath38 ) , which defines the function @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath13 is then obtained from the set of parameters @xmath13 , @xmath25 , and @xmath28 which minimizes @xmath39 .",
    "the accuracy of this method was tested by locating the critical interaction strength in a model of spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "such a model exhibits a bkt transition for which the critical interaction strength is known analytically @xcite .",
    "the value of the critical interaction strength obtained utilizing the scaling analysis of the gap described before deviates only @xmath40 from the exact value  @xcite , and thus we are confident that a similar or better accuracy should be attained for the bkt transition in the bhm .",
    "we have applied this procedure to integer filled chains with @xmath41 and @xmath18 .",
    "we find that , in these three cases , the minimum of @xmath39 is obtained for arbitrarily large values of @xmath28 .",
    "this means that logarithmic corrections to the scaling of the gap , in the form , do not play a role in the determination of the critical point .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the @xmath9-@xmath42-@xmath43 model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath28 was found to be finite in all transitions analyzed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_ssr](a ) , we present a density plot corresponding to @xmath44 for @xmath0 , which exhibits a clear minimum at @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the error bars are estimated by repeating the minimization procedure adding and subtracting to the gap the error of the energy ( overestimated to be @xmath47 ) .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity of the results to the selection of the interval of values of @xmath7 used in the fit is also included in the error bars such that our results are independent of that choice .",
    "corresponding to the set of parameters that minimizes @xmath48 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_ssr](b ) , we plot @xmath33 vs @xmath37 . the data are clearly seen to collapse to a single curve representing the function @xmath35 . in the inset",
    ", the curves for the rescaled gap corresponding to different system sizes are seen to merge around the critical value @xmath13 .",
    "previous calculations have obtained @xmath13 through widely different techniques , some of which we mention below .",
    "an early quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) study found @xmath49 using the closing of the gap at the critical point @xcite , while later qmc simulations yielded a smaller value @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "an approximated calculation using the bethe ansatz suggested that @xmath51  @xcite , and strong coupling expansion calculations predicted @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "exact diagonalization studies led to @xmath53 @xcite , while combining exact diagonalization with renormalization group insights , a value of @xmath54 was reported in ref .  .",
    "also , using extrapolated measurements of the fidelity susceptibility extracted from exact diagonalization of small clusters , @xmath55 was found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of the first dmrg approaches to tackle this problem using extrapolations of the gap , a value of @xmath56 was determined .",
    "later dmrg studies , based on accurate extrapolations of the decay of correlation functions , reported @xmath57  @xcite and @xmath58  @xcite , and , more recently , @xmath59 @xcite and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "computing the luttinger parameter using bipartite fluctuations , ref .",

    "finite - size scaling analyses of the von neumann entanglement entropy suggested that @xmath13 lays between @xmath62 and @xmath63  @xcite and @xmath64  @xcite , while computations of the von neumann entropy directly in the thermodynamic limit ( using the infinite time - evolving block decimation algorithm ) produced a critical value @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "our result for @xmath13 is therefore in good agreement with the lowest values reported in the most recent studies that use widely diverse quantities to characterize this transition .    we have also computed the critical values for other commensurate fillings , and found @xmath65 for @xmath1 [ figs .",

    "[ fig : fidsusc ] , we show the fidelity susceptibility for the bhm at fillings @xmath14 , for systems with @xmath74 , and for on - site interactions up to @xmath75 . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath67 exhibits clear maxima for values of @xmath7 greater than @xmath13 computed from the scaling of the gap .",
    "consistent with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , the positions of the maxima are seen to move toward weaker interactions , and their height to increase , with increasing system size . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the maxima are expected to be beyond the values of @xmath7 studied here .",
    "hence , indications for the existence of a phase transition are obtained already for small systems .",
    "interestingly , and also of relevance to the @xmath67 s calculated here , recent works have proposed that a minimum of the fs may signal the quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "this was argued to be possible because , depending on the scaling dimensions of the system , the fs can be finite at a critical point @xcite . in fig .  [ fig : fidsusc ] , one can indeed see that minima of @xmath67 also occur close to the critical point .",
    "it is also apparent in our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidsusc ] that , between the maxima and the minima , there is a point at which all values of @xmath67 seem to be independent of @xmath29 for the system sizes treated .",
    "a similar scenario was observed in the xxz chain @xcite and for su(@xmath76 ) hubbard chains @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidsusc ] , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the `` crossing '' of the fs curves for different system sizes occurs at values of @xmath7 greater than @xmath13 computed from the scaling of the gap .",
    "we applied different extrapolation schemes for @xmath67 and did not obtain results consistent with those from the scaling of the gap : for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidsusc ] we show the outcome of the simplest approach in which the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit is attained using a second - order polynomial .",
    "neither the position of the maximum , nor the one of the minimum or of the crossing point , is in agreement with the values of @xmath13 obtained from the scaling of the gap .    as pointed out in previous studies ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an analysis of the 1d fermi hubbard model ) , the divergence of @xmath67 can be extremely slow , and very large system sizes ( as well as a more elaborate finite - size - scaling ansatz ) may be required to resolve the critical point .",
    "this is further supported by the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a field theoretical analysis of @xmath67 at the bkt transition in the xxz chain unveiled a very slow divergence .",
    "however , the numerical findings for the bhm here and the xxz chain in ref .",
    "@xcite differ in two important aspects : as opposed to the behavior of the xxz chain , in this work we have found that logarithmic corrections are negligible in the finite - size scaling of the gap of the bhm ( for the system sizes analyzed ) .",
    "also , the crossing point of the fs in the xxz chain occurs for a value of the interaction strength that is smaller than the critical one , which is the opposite of what we find here for the bhm .",
    "hence , the numerical data at hand make it difficult to determine @xmath13 utilizing the fs ; further studies are needed to fully understand the behavior of this quantity in the bhm , and in particular , its contrast to the one observed for the xxz chain .",
    "in order to determine the critical point in experiments with ultracold bosons in optical lattices , we propose to follow a recent proposal that uses bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "the idea is to apply an external field @xmath77 at time @xmath78 , to a system that is initially in its ground state ( @xmath79 for @xmath80 ) .",
    "such a set up can be realized in optical lattice experiments by , e.g. , tilting the lattice .",
    "one can then study the center - of - mass motion ( com ) @xmath81 where @xmath76 is the total number of particles , at times @xmath78 . in previous studies , in a variant of the @xmath9-@xmath8 model at low filling @xcite and in an effective ising model in a transverse field @xcite , it was reported that the amplitude of the com exhibited signatures of the quantum phase transition at the critical point . in the @xmath9-@xmath8 like model @xcite , because of the formation of pairs , the transition from a metallic to a gapped superconducting phase was visible by both a rapid decrease of the amplitude and by a doubling of the frequency of the bloch oscillations . in the ising like model @xcite",

    "[ fig : oscillations_tv](a ) , we display the com of a half - filled chain of spinless fermions with @xmath89 and different values of @xmath42 on both sides of the ll to cdw transition .",
    "it is apparent that the amplitude of the oscillations decreases and the damping rate increases when increasing @xmath42 and , deep in the cdw phase , no oscillations can be resolved .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behavior of a harmonic oscillator which moves freely ( @xmath90 ) , damped ( @xmath91 ) and overdamped ( @xmath92 ) . in the ll phase ,",
    "mass transport is ballistic and , therefore , it is possible for spinless fermions to freely flow upon the introduction of a small tilt of the lattice , which gives rise to com oscillations . on the other hand , in the cdw",
    "phase the system is gapped and transport under a small tilt is suppressed , which precludes com oscillations . a qualitatively similar behavior is observed in the com of the bhm at filling @xmath0 and for @xmath93 [ fig .  [",

    ", it can be seen that the amplitude of the oscillations at the critical point and above ( @xmath96 ) is very small and decreases with increasing system size .",
    "the results for the bhm are qualitatively similar .",
    "the region of @xmath7 at which the amplitude of the bloch oscillations is seen to vanish , @xmath97 , contains the value obtained from the scaling analysis of the gap @xmath98 .",
    "this behavior of the bloch oscillations is also reflected in the fourier transform ( ft ) of the time evolution of the com , which we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : bo_amplitudes](c ) for spinless fermions and in fig .",
    "[ fig : bo_amplitudes](d ) for the bhm . in both cases , for weak interactions , there is a well - defined peak around @xmath99 , which reflects the oscillations observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillations_tv ] . as the interaction strength",
    "is increased , the height of that peak slowly decreases and its position ( slightly ) changes .",
    "this is accompanied by an increase in the weight of the zero - frequency mode . for both systems , as the interaction is increased past the critical value , it is no longer possible to resolve the finite frequency peak .",
    "this is another indication that the com oscillations are suppressed for @xmath100 .",
