    "the variety of accessible final states in @xmath12 decays to two mesons provides an abundant source of information on cp violation and flavour - changing processes . when the final state consists of two vector mesons , an angular analysis of the vector mesons decay products also provides insight into the spin structure of the flavour - changing interaction . for the @xmath13 coupling of the standard model , a specific pattern of the three helicity amplitudes",
    "is expected  @xcite , such that the longitudinal polarisation fraction @xmath14 should be close to 1 . since @xmath15 was first observed @xcite for penguin - dominated strangeness - changing decays , many theoretical papers addressed the question whether this result could be explained as a strong - interaction effect , or whether it could be reproduced within specific `` new physics '' scenarios @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit this question using the qcd factorisation framework @xcite to deal with the strong interaction in the amplitude calculation .",
    "our study goes beyond previous ones in several respects . on the theoretical side",
    "we provide the first complete results for the hard - scattering kernels relevant to vector - vector ( @xmath16 ) final states , correcting several errors in the literature .",
    "( in fact , the only correct calculation is  @xcite . )",
    "we also provide a more detailed discussion of the factorisation structure and power counting for the various amplitudes .",
    "it seems to have escaped attention so far that , contrary to the longitudinal polarisation amplitude and those relevant to @xmath17 and @xmath18 final states , the transverse polarisation amplitudes do not factorise even at leading power in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "this , together with the high sensitvity to penguin weak - annihilation  @xcite , implies that the calculation of polarisation observables stands on a much less solid footing than the calculation of @xmath19 decays . on the phenomenological side",
    ", we provide estimates for all @xmath20 decays ( including @xmath21 decays ) and for all parameters that enter the angular analysis .",
    "previous studies concentrated on single or a few decay modes and considered the longitudinal polarisation fraction @xmath14 only , making it often difficult to distinguish general patterns from the consequences of particular parameters choices .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : defs ] we summarise the definitions for the helicity amplitudes , angular variables and polarisation observables .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath20 decay amplitudes in the qcd factorisation framework is briefly reviewed in section  [ sec : factorisation ] .",
    "we then discuss a few aspects of the transverse polarisation amplitudes that allow for an understanding of the main characteristics of @xmath20 phenomenology .",
    "one important conclusion from this discussion is that the analysis of @xmath1 decays will be much less rigorous and much more uncertain than the corresponding analysis of @xmath22 and @xmath1 modes @xcite .",
    "the technical results of the calculation are summarised in an appendix .",
    "section  [ sec : inputs ] provides the list of input parameters , an overview of the flavour amplitude parameters with theoretical uncertainties , and a classification of the 34 @xmath1 decay channels , which guides the subsequent numerical analysis .",
    "we begin the analysis in section  [ sec : tree ] with a discussion of branching fractions , cp asymmetries and polarisation observables of the nine tree - dominated decays . among these the four colour - allowed modes can be well predicted .",
    "in particular , we show that the time - dependent cp asymmetry measurement in @xmath23 leads to one of the most accurate determinations of the ckm angle @xmath4 . in section  [ sec : penguin ] we turn to the 14 colour - allowed penguin - dominated decay modes .",
    "it will be seen that theoretical calculations allow for large transverse polarisation within large uncertainties .",
    "this suggests to determine the transverse penguin amplitude from data using the well - measured @xmath24 modes .",
    "this approach is used to sharpen the predictions for the remaining decay modes in this class .",
    "the analysis concludes in section  [ sec : others ] with a brief discussion of the remaining penguin - dominated modes , and decays that occur only through weak annihilation .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarises our main results and conclusions .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 meson with four - momentum @xmath25 and mass @xmath26 decaying into two light vector mesons @xmath27 , @xmath28 with masses @xmath29 of order @xmath30 .",
    "the decay amplitude can be decomposed into three scalar amplitudes @xmath31 according to @xmath32 with convention @xmath33 alternatively , one can choose a basis of amplitudes describing decays to final state particles with definite helicity @xmath34 or use the transversity amplitudes , where @xmath35 are replaced by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , corresponding to linearly polarised final states .",
    "we choose @xmath38 to be directed in positive @xmath39-direction in the @xmath0 meson rest frame , and the polarisation four - vectors of the light vector mesons such that in a frame where both light mesons have large momentum along the @xmath39-axis , they are given by @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 . here and thoughout the paper we neglect corrections @xmath43 quadratic in the light meson masses .",
    "thus @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "our conventions imply the identity @xmath46    experimentally , the magnitudes and relative phases of the various amplitudes are extracted from the angular distributions of the vector resonance decay products .",
    "the full angular dependence of the cascade where both vector mesons decay into pseudoscalar particles is given by @xcite @xmath47                 \\\\&\\mathrel{\\hphantom{\\propto } }               + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sin^2\\vartheta_1\\sin^2\\vartheta_2                 \\,{\\mathrm{re}}\\left({\\mathrm{e}}^{2 i\\varphi } { \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{a}}}_+ { \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{a}}}_-^*\\right ) ,    \\end{split } \\label{angulardist}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 measures the angle between the decay planes of the two vector mesons in the @xmath0 meson rest frame , and @xmath49 are the angles between the direction of motion of one of the @xmath50 pseudoscalar final states and the inverse direction of motion of the @xmath0 meson as measured in the @xmath51 rest frame , see figure  [ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "the omitted proportionality factor is such that one obtains the decay rate @xmath52 when @xmath53 and @xmath54 are integrated from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , and @xmath48 from 0 to @xmath57 .    .",
    "]    thus , any given @xmath20 decay allows us to define five observables corresponding to the three magnitudes and two relative phases of the helicity amplitudes , or the five angular coefficients in ( [ angulardist ] ) . in experimental analyses ,",
    "observables are preferably defined in terms of the transversity amplitudes as they have definite cp transformation properties .",
    "a typical set of observables consists of the branching fraction , two out of the three polarisation fractions @xmath58 , and two phases @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 it is conventional to combine the five observables of some @xmath20 decay with those of its cp - conjugate @xmath62 decay , and to quote the ten resulting observables as cp - averages and cp - asymmetries .",
    "we denote @xmath62 decay helicity amplitudes as @xmath63 and define the corresponding transversity amplitudes as @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 in the absence of cp violation .",
    "observables @xmath66 are then defined as in ( [ eq : polobs ] ) , and cp averages and asymmetries are calculated by @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) for the polarisation fractions and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) for the phase observables @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the implicit definition ( [ phasedef ] ) ensures that the cp - averaged phase is the geometrical bisection of the _ acute _ angle enclosed by @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; the magnitude of this angle is @xmath75 .",
    "more explicitly , the averaged quantities can be obtained as @xmath76 our phase convention for the amplitudes and definition of observables is compatible with that used in the relevant publications of the babar and belle collaborations ( for example in  @xcite ) , except for the sign of @xmath77 relative to the transverse amplitudes , which leads to an offset of @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "we favour the above convention , because it implies @xmath80 and @xmath81 at leading order , where all strong phases are zero .",
    "the decay amplitudes follow from the matrix elements @xmath82 of the effective hamiltonian ( conventions as in @xcite ) @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "a quark model  @xcite or naive factorisation analysis indicates a hierarchy of helicity amplitudes @xmath86 for @xmath62 meson decays .",
    "( for @xmath0 decays exchange @xmath87 . )",
    "this is a consequence of the left - handedness of the weak interaction and the fact that high - energy qcd interactions conserve helicity .    in naive factorisation",
    "one considers only the four - quark operators in @xmath88 and approximates their matrix elements by the matrix elements of two currents @xcite .",
    "the helicity amplitudes @xmath89 are proportional to @xmath90 in this approximation . evaluating this expression ( conventions for the form factors as in @xcite ) we obtain @xmath91 with the definitions @xmath92",
    "the transverse amplitudes @xmath93 are suppressed by a factor @xmath94 relative to @xmath95 .",
    "in addition , the axial - vector and vector contributions to @xmath96 cancel in the heavy - quark limit , due to an exact form factor relation @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and ( [ eq : hierarchy ] ) follows .",
    "the dominance of the longitudinal amplitude indicated by  ( [ eq : hierarchy ] ) leads to the well - known expectation that @xmath14 should be close to unity .",
    "experimental data for penguin - dominated @xmath0 decays is in conflict with this expectation thus motivating theoretical studies beyond the naive - factorisation approximation .",
    "we use the qcd factorisation approach @xcite to compute the matrix elements @xmath99 of the effective hamiltonian . in this framework",
    "they can be expressed ( at leading power in an expansion of the amplitude in @xmath100 ) in terms of form factors , meson light - cone distribution amplitudes and perturbatively calculable hard scattering kernels . in condensed notation",
    ", the factorisation formula reads @xmath101 \\right )         + t^{ii}_i { \\ast}f_b \\phi_{{{\\ensuremath{{b } } } } }                    { \\ast}f_{v_1}\\phi_{v_1 }                   { \\ast}f_{v_2}\\phi_{v_2 } ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the star products imply an integration over light - cone momentum fractions .",
    "in addition the framework contains estimates of some power corrections , which usually can not be computed rigorously .",
    "we follow closely the scheme developed in @xcite for @xmath102 decays to match contributions to the hard - scattering kernels @xmath103 on terms involving products of flavour coefficients @xmath104 and factorised matrix elements @xmath105 .",
    "the longitudinal amplitude @xmath106 can be deduced from the results given in @xcite . for the analysis of the present paper we calculated the transverse helicity amplitudes . in the following",
    "we describe the basic results and main differences with respect to the longitudinal amplitude ; the expressions for the hard - scattering functions are given in the appendix .",
    "non - leptonic decay amplitudes are sums of products of ckm factors , wilson coefficients from ( [ eq : heff ] ) and matrix elements ( [ eq : qcdfformula ] ) of operators with different flavours .",
    "it is convenient to organise the amplitudes according to flavour .",
    "thus , one writes for example , @xmath107 \\nonumber\\\\     & & + \\ , a^h_{\\bar k^*\\rho } \\big [ \\delta_{pu}\\,\\alpha_2^h       + \\frac{3}{2}\\alpha_{3,{\\rm ew}}^{p , h } \\big]\\bigg\\}. \\label{ampexample}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in naive factorisation , the flavour coefficients @xmath104 are linear combinations of wilson coefficients @xmath108 . in qcd factorisation , they include non - factorisable loop effects and spectator - scattering .",
    "the @xmath109 coefficients parameterise weak annihilation amplitudes .",
    "the decomposition of the amplitudes for the 34 @xmath16 final states in terms of these quantities follows from the @xmath18 expressions given in  @xcite with obvious replacements of pseudoscalar by vector mesons .",
    "the @xmath110 relate to the coefficients @xmath111 used in the older factorisation literature as follows ( helicity indices and @xmath112 arguments suppressed ) : @xmath113 where we have used the notation @xmath114    the explicit expressions for the negative - helicity coefficients @xmath115 and the transverse weak annihilation amplitudes are collected in the appendix . beyond leading order the @xmath115 are sums of vertex corrections , penguin contractions , and spectator - scattering contributions , see ( [ ai ] ) .",
    "most of the relevant hard - scattering functions have been calculated before . in @xcite results for",
    "all three of these contributions have been given .",
    "we do not find agreement with these results , however .",
    "as far as we understand , the origin of the discrepancy is that the authors of these papers use an incorrect projection on the light - cone distribution amplitudes of transversely polarised vector mesons , which neglects the transverse - momentum derivative terms in ( [ eq : mperp ] ) .",
    "an exception is @xcite , which does state the correct projector , but the results still differ from ours , particularly for the spectator - scattering contributions .",
    "kagan @xcite has calculated the qcd penguin contractions , spectator - scattering terms as well as the weak annihilation amplitudes , but did not consider the vertex contractions .",
    "we confirm his results on the penguin contractions and qcd penguin annihilation , for which explicit expressions were given in the paper .",
    "the nlo calculation of the negative - helicity amplitude is quite similar to the calculation of the longitudinal amplitude .",
    "the result exhibits , however , some qualitative differences which have important consequences for the phenomenology of @xmath20 decays . in this section",
    "we explain the non - factorisation of the negative - helicity amplitude ; that the positive - helicity amplitude can not be calculated in an analogous manner ; that the amplitude hierarchy ( [ eq : hierarchy ] ) is violated by electromagnetic effects ; that penguin annihilation is comparatively more significant for transverse polarisation than longitudinal polarisation penguin amplitudes .",
    "the factorisation formula ( [ eq : qcdfformula ] ) contains two structurally different terms , the first of which is dominated by soft interactions within the @xmath116 transitions .",
    "these are absorbed into the qcd form factor .",
    "the second term stands for interactions where a hard ( more precisely , hard - collinear ) interaction with the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson takes place .",
    "both terms are of the same order in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "this remains true for the transverse polarisation amplitudes , but now one finds that the convolution integrals over the light - cone distribution amplitudes are logarithmically divergent due to the occurence of the integral @xmath117 see  ( [ eq : hm1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : hm2 ] ) .",
    "this endpoint divergence at @xmath118 signals that the presumed factorisation of spectator - scattering does not hold _ even at leading power_. a similar effect occurs in the @xmath19 and longitudinal @xmath20 amplitude only when one attempts to calculate power corrections by applying the light - cone projection including twist-3 terms .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that this divergence is obtained at leading - power for the transverse amplitude , since the entire amplitude is formally a twist-3 term .",
    "( this is the origin of the power suppression of the transverse amplitudes relative to the longitudinal amplitude . )",
    "factorisation - violation at the leading power implies that the calculation of transverse polarisation amplitudes is on a much less solid footing than of the other amplitudes , and often should be considered more as an estimate . in practice ,",
    "we find that the non - factorisation of spectator - scattering is only significant for the colour - suppressed tree and the flavour - singlet qcd penguin amplitudes , where the ( regulated ) divergent integral is multiplied by a large wilson coefficient .",
    "the fact that there are endpoint divergences in the spectator - scattering contribution to the transverse helicity amplitudes has been observed in previous calculations , but its significance for the theoretical status of the factorisation approach and its phenomenological implications have not been sufficiently emphasized .",
    "the calculation of the kernels @xmath119 in ( [ eq : qcdfformula ] ) can be interpreted as matching the operators @xmath120 to four - quark operators with field content @xmath121   [ \\bar\\xi h_v]$ ] in soft - collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath122 describes collinear quarks moving in the direction of @xmath123 , the meson that does not pick up the spectator quark , and satisfies @xmath124 .",
    "the leading quark bilinears that have non - vanishing overlap with @xmath125 are @xmath126 the subscript @xmath127 denotes projection of a lorentz vector on the plane transverse to the two light - cone vectors @xmath128 .",
    "the first operator overlaps only with the longitudinal polarisation state of @xmath123 , the second only with a transverse vector meson .",
    "however , the second operator is not generated by the @xmath13 interactions of the standard model , at least up to the one - loop level .",
    "hence the transverse amplitudes arise from power - suppressed operators @xmath129 [ \\bar\\xi h_v]$ ] .",
    "( in terms of the light - cone projector ( [ eq : mperp ] ) this statement implies that the leading term in the first line does not contribute for @xmath13 interactions , leaving the twist-3 terms in the second and third line .",
    "since @xmath130 contains transverse momentum derivatives , one must keep the transverse momenta of partons collinear to @xmath123 ; this explains why the transverse - momentum derivative terms in the projector are required . )",
    "the left - handedness of the weak interactions implies that operators of this form contribute only to the negative - helicity amplitude .",
    "the positive - helicity amplitude appears first in yet higher - dimensional operators such as @xmath131 [ \\bar\\xi d_\\perp h_v]$ ] . to match to such operators one must keep the transverse momentum of the quark lines collinear to both mesons non - zero",
    "such a calculation has not yet been done , and therefore all calculations of the positive - helicity amplitude in the literature must be regarded as incomplete .",
    "it is even possible that for the positive - helicity amplitude no useful factorisation formula holds even for the non - spectator - scattering terms in ( [ eq : qcdfformula ] ) .",
    "it follows that the positive - helicity amplitude is power - suppressed relative to the negative one , and should be set to zero in the absence of any consistent calculation of this power correction . within this approximation , @xmath132 ,",
    "there are only two rather than four independent polarisation observables , since @xmath133 similarly identities for the corresponding cp asymmetries hold .",
    "it should be noted that these identities are non - trivial consequences of the @xmath13 nature of the weak interactions _ and _ of factorisation , and it is therefore worthwhile to test them experimentally .    in our analysis we proceed as follows : we assume the naive - factorisation expression for the positive - helicity amplitude @xmath134 and allow the form factor to vary within the range @xmath135 .",
    "thus , we allow a small variation of @xmath134 around zero to estimate the error from neglecting this power correction .",
    "we note that qcd sum rule results for the form factors give @xmath136 values consistent with zero @xcite .      in the previous paragraphs we explained the origin of the amplitude hierarchy ( [ eq : hierarchy ] ) .",
    "however , when electromagnetic effects are included , a transverse polarisation amplitude can be generated by a short - distance transition to a vector meson and a photon with small virtuality which subsequently converts to a vector meson @xcite .",
    "this transition is enhanced by a factor @xmath137 due to the large photon propagator , resulting in the parametric relation @xmath138 thus , formally , the negative - helicity amplitude is leading in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "technically , this is related to the existence of the operator @xmath139 [ \\bar\\xi h_v]$ ] , which contributes only to the transverse amplitude , and which is enhanced relative to @xmath121   [ \\bar\\xi h_v]$ ] . in the standard model the leading effect of this type involves the electromagnetic - dipole operator in the effective hamiltonian . as a consequence",
    "the colour - allowed electroweak penguin amplitude @xmath140 is completely different from its naive - factorisation value .",
    "our calculations include this contribution , which has already been discussed specifically in @xcite .",
    "weak annihilation is a power correction not included in ( [ eq : qcdfformula ] ) , since it does not factorise due to endpoint divergences in the convolution integrals .",
    "the effect is often estimated by a parameterisation suggested in @xcite , where the endpoint - divergences are regulated by a cut - off . in this model",
    "one finds that the most important annihilation effect is a penguin annihilation amplitude that is phenomenologically indistinguishable from the qcd penguin amplitude .",
    "these general observations also hold for the transverse polarisation amplitudes .",
    "in particular , the weak annihilation contribution to the negative - helicity amplitude is a power correction relative to the leading , factorisable contributions to this amplitude . yet , as found in @xcite , the effect is numerically much larger than in @xmath19 decays , and perhaps so large that a theoretical calculation of the negative - helicity qcd penguin amplitude is no longer possible .    to explain this point , we consider the qcd penguin amplitude @xmath141,\\ ] ] and compare the @xmath106 and @xmath142 amplitudes . here",
    "@xmath143 are the qcd penguin contributions , and @xmath144 the penguin annihilation contributions .",
    "for the longitudinal amplitude @xmath145 is @xmath146 suppressed relative to @xmath147 , but it turns out that numerically the largest effect arises from a @xmath148 term , which has a large colour factor and wilson coefficient .",
    "this particular contribution is not suppressed by the extra factor of @xmath146 in the negative - helicity amplitude .",
    "one finds @xmath149 , while @xmath150 due to the power suppression of @xmath151 with respect to @xmath152 .",
    "thus , relative to @xmath143 the numerical effect of @xmath144 is a factor of @xmath153 larger for the negative - helicity amplitude than for the longitudinal amplitude ( but still power - suppressed since the suppression was @xmath148 for @xmath106 ) .",
    "the following numerical estimates illustrate this point .",
    "we consider the @xmath154 , @xmath155 helicity amplitudes for @xmath7 , and also the @xmath156 amplitude for comparison .",

    "thus , for penguin - dominated decays , a longitudinal polarisation fraction @xmath14 around 0.5 is not ruled out .",
    "let us summarise these and a few further observations on the role of weak annihilation in @xmath20 decays :    * the annihilation contribution to the longitudinal penguin amplitude is small , perhaps due to an accidental cancellation . *",
    "the annihilation contribution to the negative - helicity penguin amplitude can ( but need not ) be very large , possibly leading to significant transverse polarisation in penguin - dominated decays . *",

    "* we also calculated the weak annihilation contribution to the positive - helicity amplitude , and find that the large contribution to @xmath166 is absent .",
    "hence there is no evidence for large corrections to ( [ pluszero ] ) even for penguin - dominated decays .",

    "another qualitative difference to the longitudinal amplitude is that the @xmath267-integrals in ( [ eq : hm1 ] ) , ( [ eq : hm2 ] ) are divergent , since the integrand is too singular near @xmath118 .",
    "thus factorisation for the negative - helicity amplitude breaks down even at leading order in the heavy - quark expansion due to the non - factorisation of spectator - scattering . to estimate this contribution",
    ", we extract the logarithmic divergence by applying a `` plus - prescription '' to the integrand , and replace the large logarithm by a phenomenological parameter @xmath268 @xcite . to estimate the endpoint behaviour , we note that the asymptotic distribution amplitudes are @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 .",
