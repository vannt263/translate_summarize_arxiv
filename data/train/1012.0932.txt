    "the random - matrix theory ( rmt ) of quantum transport studies the statistical distribution of phase coherent transport properties in an ensemble of random scattering matrices .",
    "the theory finds a major application in the context of chaotic scattering , because then the ensemble is fully specified by fundamental symmetries  without requiring microscopic input.@xcite since scattering phase shifts for chaotic scattering are uniformly distributed on the unit circle , such ensembles are called `` circular '' , following dyson who first introduced these ensembles in a mathematical context.@xcite the circular ensembles have been successful in describing experiments on low - temperature electrical and thermal conduction in quantum dots , which are confined geometries connected by point contacts to metallic or superconducting electrodes . for a recent overview of the field",
    "we refer to several chapters of a forthcoming handbook.@xcite    while metallic quantum dots are characterized by the three circular ensembles introduced originally by dyson,@xcite superconducting quantum dots are described by four different ensembles discovered by altland and zirnbauer.@xcite the classification of the superconducting ensembles is based on the presence or absence of time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry , as summarized in table [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "the symmetry classes are called d , diii , c , and ci , in a notation which originates from differential geometry.@xcite the corresponding circular ensembles , in the nomenclature of ref .  , are the circular real ( cre ) and circular quaternion ( cqe ) ensembles in class d and c , respectively , and their time - reversal invariant restrictions ( t - cre and t - cqe ) in class diii and ci .

    "[ fig_gplot ] we see that upon increasing @xmath3 , the conductance distributions for @xmath9 and @xmath10 become more and more similar .",
    "to quantify the difference , we list in table [ table_cre ] the first few cumulants @xmath11 of @xmath8 for several values of @xmath3 . inspection of the table brings us to propose that :    * _ the cumulant of order @xmath4 of the @xmath3-mode conductance in the cre is independent of the topological charge for @xmath12 . _    a proof for arbitrary @xmath3 is given in app .",
    "[ appb ] .",

    "[ fig_gplot ] , for the t - cre . ]      in the presence of time - reversal symmetry ( class diii , ensemble t - cre ) we can similarly calculate the conductance distribution from eqs .   and .",

    "the analogous theorem for the @xmath2-independence of low - order cumulants now reads :    * _ the cumulant of order @xmath4 of the @xmath3-mode conductance in the t - cre is independent of the topological charge for @xmath22 . _    a proof for arbitrary ( even ) @xmath3 is given also in app .",
    "[ appb ] .",
    "weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) refer to the average and to the variance of the conductance in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "since the dependence on the topological charge is nonpertubative in @xmath3 , these two effects can not contain any information on whether the superconductor is in a topological phase or not . as a check ,",
    "we have calculated the average @xmath23 and the variance @xmath24 for @xmath25 , directly from the probability distribution of the andreev reflection eigenvalues .",
    "this calculation also allows us to verify a conjecture from ref .   on the ucf in the presence of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "since the calculation follows established methods in random - matrix theory,@xcite we only give the results .",
    "the weak - localization correction @xmath26 to the conductance vanishes in the cre and cqe , while @xmath27 in the t - cre and t - cqe , respectively .",
    "the ucf are given by @xmath28 in the cre , t - cre , cqe , and t - cqe , respectively .",
    "these @xmath2-independent results are in full agreement with ref .  .",
    "all these results assume that the proximity to the superconductor does not induce an excitation gap in the quantum dot . in the cre and cqe",
    "this is realized by the pair - breaking magnetic field . in the t - cre and t - cqe",
    "we need a @xmath29-junction to close the gap : two ns interfaces , coupled equally well to the quantum dot and with a @xmath29 phase difference of the superconducting phase.@xcite for a single ns interface in zero magnetic field , the presence of an excitation gap does not change the value of @xmath30 , but the variance of the conductance is changed into@xcite @xmath31 , with @xmath32 or @xmath33 in the presence or absence of spin - rotation symmetry . notice that time - reversal symmetry breaking then has only a relatively small 10% effect on the ucf,@xcite while in the absence of the excitation gap the effect on the variance is a factor of two.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the distribution @xmath8 of the electrical conductance in a quantum dot connecting a normal - metal to a superconducting electrode has a striking dependence on the topological quantum number @xmath2 of the superconductor , but only if the number of modes @xmath3 in which the current is injected is sufficiently small . in the absence of time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry ,",

    "<S> we calculate the probability distribution of the andreev reflection eigenvalues @xmath0 at the fermi level in the circular ensemble of random - matrix theory . without spin - rotation symmetry , the statistics of the electrical conductance @xmath1 depends on the topological quantum number @xmath2 of the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this dependence is nonperturbative in the number @xmath3 of scattering channels , by proving that the @xmath4-th cumulant of @xmath1 is independent of @xmath2 for @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 or @xmath7 in the presence or in the absence of time - reversal symmetry ) . a large-@xmath3 effect such as weak localization can not , therefore , probe the topological quantum number . for small @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the full distribution @xmath8 of the conductance and find qualitative differences in the topologically trivial and nontrivial phases . </S>"
