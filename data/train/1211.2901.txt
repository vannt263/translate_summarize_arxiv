    "experimentally , kim and chan recently reported they found nonclassical rotational inertia which should be an direct evidence of supersolid based on leggett s suggestion in solid @xmath3he @xcite , however , it has also been pointed out that this observation may not be due to supersolid but due to other reasons , such as an increase in shear modulus of bulk solid helium @xcite , and triggered an intense debate @xcite .    besides the study of supersolids in condensed matter systems , ultracold atoms in optical lattices",

    "trapped bose - einstein condensates with dipole - dipole interaction can produce a  roton \" minimum in the excitation spectrum @xcite , and this led to the prediction of supersolid upon softening of the roton excitation energy @xcite .",
    "recently , on the basis of off - resonant dressing of atomic bose - einstein condensates to high - lying rydberg states , people have found the effective atomic interactions resulting from such a rydberg dressing can also produce a roton minimum and , therefore , provide a clean realization of available model for supersolidity @xcite .    in this work ,",

    "it has been pointed out that the density wave instability introduced by fermions will establish crystalline order , while the condensate bosons exhibit superfluidity , so a supersolid phase emerges at finite temperature @xcite . for the bose - bose - fermi mixtures studied here , besides the density wave instability introduced by fermions",

    ", the supersolid can be detected via the usual coherence peak of a bosonic condensate in an optical lattice .",

    "based on the results above , we can make the conclusion that it is more favorable to observe the supersolid in bose - bose - fermi mixtures than in bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "in this article , we have investigated a bose - bose - fermi mixture subjected to a square lattice and found that the instability corresponding to bose - bose phase separation always happens at a higher temperature than the one corresponding to bose - fermi phase separation .",
