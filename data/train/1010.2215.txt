    "cosmological data from a wide range of sources including type ia supernovae @xcite , the cosmic microwave background @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , cluster gas fractions @xcite and gamma ray bursts @xcite seem to indicate that at least 70% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of an exotic , negative - pressure component , which drives the universe acceleration . although the simplest way to explain this behavior is the consideration of a cosmological constant @xcite , the known fine - tuning problem led to the dark energy paradigm . the dynamical nature of dark energy , at least in an effective level ,",
    "can originate from a variable cosmological `` constant '' @xcite , or from various fields , such is a canonical scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite , a phantom field , that is a scalar field with a negative sign of the kinetic term @xcite , the combination of quintessence and phantom in a unified model named quintom @xcite , or from k - essence @xcite and unparticles @xcite . on the other hand , the dynamical dark energy can effectively be described by modifying gravity itself , using a functions of the curvature scalar @xcite , of the gauss - bonnet invariant @xcite , or of the square of the weyl tensor @xcite , higher derivatives in the action @xcite , braneworld extensions @xcite , string - inspired constructions @xcite , holographic properties @xcite , uv modifications @xcite etc .",
    "an interesting alternative to general relativity is the so - called @xmath0 gravity , which has recently received considerable attention as a possible explanation of the late - time acceleration @xcite .",
    "it is based on the old idea of the `` teleparallel '' equivalence of general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite , which , instead of using the reimann - cartan space with curvature but no torsion defined via the levi - civita connection , uses the weitzenbck connection that has no curvature but only torsion .",
    "the dynamical objects in such a framework are the four linearly independent vierbeins .",
    "the advantage of this framework is that the torsion tensor is formed solely from products of first derivatives of the tetrad . as described in @xcite , the lagrangian density , @xmath1 ,",
    "can then be constructed from this torsion tensor under the assumptions of invariance under general coordinate transformations , global lorentz transformations , and the parity operation , along with requiring the lagrangian density to be second order in the torsion tensor . however , instead of using the tensor scalar @xmath1 the authors of @xcite generalized the above formalism to a modified @xmath0 version , thus making the lagrangian density a function of @xmath1 , similar to the well - known extension of @xmath2 einstein - hilbert action .",
    "in comparison with @xmath2 gravity , whose fourth - order equations may lead to pathologies , @xmath0 gravity has the significant advantage of producing field equations which are at most second order in field derivatives .",
    "this feature has led to a rapidly increasing interest in the literature , and apart from obtaining acceleration @xcite one can reconstruct a variety of cosmological evolutions @xcite , add a scalar field @xcite , examine the conformal transformations @xcite , use observational data in order to constrain the model parameters @xcite , examine the dynamical behavior of the scenario @xcite and the possibility of the phantom divide crossing @xcite , and proceed beyond the background evolution , investigating the vacuum and matter perturbations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in constructing @xmath0 scenarios , that exhibit the same background behavior with any given cosmological model .",
    "however , we additionally investigate the perturbation evolution , and in particular we examine the growth of matter overdensity , since it distinguishes between the dynamical dark energy scenario and its equivalent family of @xmath0 models .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we briefly review the cosmology of @xmath0 gravity , both at the background and linearized regimes . in section [ reconstr ]",
    "we present the general formalism of reconstructing the equivalent @xmath0 models of any given dynamical dark energy scenario , as well as the formalism of using perturbations in order to distinguish them . in section [ quintappl ]",
    "we apply the obtained formalism in the quintessence scenario .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] summarizes our results .",
    "in this section we present @xmath0 gravity , we provide the background cosmological equations in a universe governed by such a modified gravitational sector , and we give the first order perturbed equations . throughout the work we consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background geometry with metric @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the scale factor . in this manuscript",
    "our notation is as follows : greek indices @xmath5 ... run over all coordinate space - time 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , lower case latin indices ( from the middle of the alphabet ) @xmath6 run over spatial coordinates 1 , 2 , 3 , capital latin indices @xmath7 ... run over the tangent space - time 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and lower case latin indices ( from the beginning of the alphabet ) @xmath8 ... will run over the tangent space spatial coordinates 1 , 2 , 3 .",
    "let us present @xmath0 gravity . as stated in the introduction ,",
    "the dynamical variable of the old `` teleparallel '' gravity , as well as its @xmath0 extension , is the vierbein field @xmath9 , where capital as well as greek indices take the values @xmath10 .",
    "this forms an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at each point @xmath11 of the manifold , that is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the vector @xmath14 can be analyzed with the use of its components @xmath15 in a coordinate basis , that is @xmath16 .",
    "in such a framework , the metric tensor is obtained from the dual vierbein as @xmath17 contrary to general relativity , which uses the torsionless levi - civita connection , in the present formalism ones uses the curvatureless weitzenbck connection @xcite , whose torsion tensor reads @xmath18 moreover , the contorsion tensor , which equals the difference between weitzenbck and levi - civita connections , is defined as @xmath19 finally , it proves useful to define @xmath20 note the antisymmetric relations @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as can be easily verified . using these quantities",
    "one can define the so called `` teleparallel lagrangian '' as @xcite @xmath23 in summary , in the present formalism , all the information concerning the gravitational field is included in the torsion tensor @xmath24 , and the teleparallel lagrangian @xmath25 gives rise to the dynamical equations for the vierbein , which imply the einstein equations for the metric .    from the above discussion",
    "one can deduce that the teleparallel lagrangian arises from the torsion tensor , similar to the way the curvature scalar arises from the curvature ( riemann ) tensor .",
    "thus , one can simplify the notation by replacing the symbol @xmath25 by the symbol @xmath1 , which is the torsion scalar @xcite .",
    "while in teleparallel gravity the action is constructed by the teleparallel lagrangian @xmath26 , the idea of @xmath0 gravity is to generalize @xmath1 to a function @xmath27 , which is similar in spirit to the generalization of the ricci scalar @xmath28 in the einstein - hilbert action to a function @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", the action in a universe governed by @xmath0 gravity reads : @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 stands for the matter lagrangian .",
    "we mention here that since the ricci scalar @xmath28 and the torsion scalar @xmath1 differ only by a total derivative @xcite , in the case where @xmath0 is a constant ( which will play the role of a cosmological constant ) the action ( [ action ] ) is equivalent to general relativity with a cosmological constant .",
    "finally , we mention that throughout this work we use the common choice for the form of the vierbien , namely [ weproudlyuse ] e_^a = diag(1,a , a , a ) . it can be easily found that the family of vierbiens related to ( [ weproudlyuse ] ) through global lorentz transformations , lead to the same equations of motion .",
    "note however that , as it was shown in @xcite , @xmath0 gravity does not preserve local lorentz invariance .",
    "thus , one should in principle study the cosmological consequences of a more general vierbien ansatz .",
    "definitely the subject needs further investigation and it is left for a future work .",
    "let us now present the background cosmological equations in a universe governed by @xmath0 gravity .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the vierbein gives the equations of motion    @xmath32 -e_{a}^{\\lambda}t^{\\rho}{}_{\\mu\\lambda}s_{\\rho}{}^{\\nu\\mu}[1+f'({t } ) ] + s_{a}{}^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}({t})f''({t})-\\frac{1}{4}e_{a}^{\\nu}[t+f({t } ) ] = 4\\pi g e_{a}^{\\rho}\\overset { \\mathbf{em}}t_{\\rho}{}^{\\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath1 and the mixed indices are used as in @xmath33 .",
    "note that the tensor @xmath34 on the right - hand side is the usual energy - momentum tensor , in which we have added an overset label in order to avoid confusion with the torsion tensor .",
    "if we assume the background to be a perfect fluid , then the energy momentum tensor takes the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fluid four - velocity . note that we are following the conventions of @xcite , but with an opposite signature metric",
    "thus , one can see that the equations ( [ eom ] ) lead to the background ( friedmann ) equations @xmath37 in these expressions we have introduced the hubble parameter @xmath38 , where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to coordinate time @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand respectively for the energy density and pressure of the matter content of the universe , with equation - of - state parameter @xmath42 .",
    "finally , we have employed the very useful relation @xmath43 which straightforwardly arises from evaluation of ( [ telelag ] ) for the unperturbed metric .    observing the form of the first friedmann equation ( [ background1 ] ) , and comparing to the standard form",
    ", we deduce that the second and third terms on the right hand side constitute effectively the dark energy sector , which in general presents a dynamical behavior .",
    "in particular , one can define the dynamical dark energy ( dde ) density as @xcite : @xmath44 , \\label{rhodde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while its equation - of - state parameter reads : [ wft ] w = - .",
    "thus , in principle , any dynamical dark energy scenario , with a given @xmath45 or a given @xmath46 , has its @xmath0 equivalent , and the corresponding reconstruction procedure will be described in section [ reconstr ] .",
    "lastly , note that general relativity is recovered by setting @xmath0 to a constant ( which will play the role of a cosmological constant ) , as expected .",
    "we now recall the first order perturbations of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for full details of the calculation , summarizing only the relevant results in this section .",
    "the perturbed metric in newtonian gauge with signature @xmath47 is written as @xmath48 where the scalars @xmath49 and @xmath50 are functions of @xmath51 and @xmath39 . writing the vierbein as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unperturbed vierbein , for the above metric we obtain @xmath54 with indicial notation as stated at the beginning of section [ model ] . moreover , unless otherwise indicated , subscripts zero and one will generally denote respectively zeroth and linear order values of quantities .",
    "we have also incorporated the additional simplifying assumption that the perturbations @xmath55 are diagonal . with these perturbations",
    "the determinant becomes @xmath56    the perturbations of the energy - momentum tensor are expressed as @xcite @xmath57    pressureless matter implies that @xmath58 , a relation that simplifies the calculations significantly .",
    "additionally , it proves convenient to transform to fourier space , where any first order quantity @xmath59 is expanded as @xmath60 in what follows , the k - subscripts in a quantity denotes its fourier transformation .    finally , from the above one can result to the following evolution equation for the metric perturbation @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are respectively given by    @xmath64    @xmath65}}{1+f'-12h^2f''},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with primes denoting derivatives with respect to @xmath1 .      in order to study the growth of perturbations in a matter - only universe ( @xmath66 ) we define as usual the overdensity @xmath67 as [ deltadef ] .thus ,",
    "the relativistic version of the poisson equation in @xmath0 gravity reads @xcite @xmath68}\\phi_k\\nonumber\\\\ & + 4\\pi g \\rho\\,\\delta_k=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ phiddk ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) can be used to evolve the matter overdensity for a given @xmath0 model .",
    "in this work we are interested in constructing the @xmath0 scenario that effectively leads to the same background behavior with a given cosmological model . we stress that this procedure has a full generality , that is for any dynamical dark energy ( dde ) scenario we can construct its @xmath0 equivalent , as long as we know the evolution of the dark energy density @xmath45 . however , despite the coincidence of the background behavior , the perturbations can be used to distinguish the given dde model from the corresponding @xmath0 reconstruction .      in order to perform the aforementioned reconstruction at the background level",
    "we start from the @xmath45 effective definition ( [ rhodde ] ) .",
    "using the fact that @xmath69 ( since @xmath70 ) , we can extract a differential equation for @xmath71 in terms of @xmath72 , namely : [ freconstruction ] = ( f+16 g _ dde ) the solution to this first - order differential equation can be written in closed form as [ fsol ] f(h)=16 g hdh+ch , where @xmath73 is an integration constant , and the corresponding @xmath0 can be straightforwardly obtained substituting @xmath74 by @xmath75 . in summary ,",
    "relation ( [ fsol ] ) describes a one - parameter family of solutions , characterized by the parameter @xmath73 , which by construction mimics perfectly the background evolution of the given dynamical dark energy density .",
    "a self - consistency test for this is that if one use the above @xmath0 and the given @xmath74 to calculate the equation - of - state parameter for the @xmath0 equivalent through ( [ wft ] ) , he finds exactly the same result as using the conservation equation @xmath76 to calculate the equation - of - state parameter for the given dde model . finally , for the special case of general relativity with a cosmological constant ( @xmath77 )",
    "( where @xmath78 ) , with @xmath79 , the corresponding @xmath0 model reduces to the expected @xmath80 .",
    "let us now make a comment on the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "interestingly , and as expected , the @xmath73 term in ( [ fsol ] ) , which corresponds to a term proportional to @xmath81 in @xmath0 , does not have any effect on the background dynamics , since it disappears from both friedmann equations ( [ background1 ] ) and ( [ background2 ] ) , and consequently from any other background - level quantity such as luminosity distances or the equation of state . in other words ,",
    "the various specific scenarios of the family of solutions given by ( [ fsol ] ) , are indistinguishable from each other at the background level .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we showed that the dde and the corresponding @xmath0 models are perfectly indistinguishable at the background level .",
    "however , this is not anymore the case if one takes into account the perturbations , as we show in this subsection . in particular",
    ", the perturbations can break the above degeneracy , that is the growth history is different for the dde as well as for each member of the corresponding reconstructed @xmath0 family .",
    "let us now proceed to the investigation of the perturbations . for convenience , in the following",
    "we express the dimensional constant @xmath73 of relation ( [ fsol ] ) in terms of the dimensionless quantity @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the hubble parameter at an initial redshift @xmath84 , that is @xmath85 , where we use the redshift @xmath86 as the independent variable instead of the scale factor ( @xmath87 with @xmath88 the present scale - factor value ) .",
    "@xmath89 is the initial energy density of the dde .",
    "if we assume @xmath90 to be slowly varying during matter domination , then the value of the integral in ( [ fsol ] ) at the initial time ( @xmath91 ) can be approximated by @xmath92 , and then @xmath93 can be physically interpreted from the fact that the initial value of @xmath94 at @xmath91 becomes @xmath95 .    amongst the individual members of a reconstructed family of @xmath0 models , corresponding to a given dde scenario , the growth histories can be different for different choices of @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , the deviations in the growth history for different values of @xmath93 are larger for smaller scales , while they diminish for large scales .",
    "this behavior can be qualitatively understood from equation ( [ poisson ] ) . using @xmath96 to denote the matter perturbations under the reconstructed @xmath0 scenarios , we perform in ( [ poisson ] ) the transformation @xmath97 , ( where @xmath98 is clearly the @xmath99 member of the family ) .",
    "we find that ( [ poisson ] ) transforms to @xmath100}\\phi_k\\nonumber\\\\ & + 4\\pi g \\rho_m\\,\\delta_{fk}=\\frac{c}{12h}\\frac{k^2}{a^2}\\phi_k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as we observe , the right - hand - side of the above equation indicates the difference between the @xmath96 of the @xmath99 model and that of the various @xmath101 ones .",
    "it is therefore clear that for large scales ( @xmath102 ) the difference between the @xmath101 and the @xmath99 models becomes small . in summary , perturbations indeed uniquely distinguish a dde scenario from the different members of the corresponding reconstructed @xmath0 family .    finally , we mention that our results are similar in spirit to @xcite in the context of @xmath2 gravity , where the authors find that any expansion history of the universe can be replicated by an one - parameter family of @xmath2 models , characterized by a parameter @xmath103 , which provides a variety of different behaviors for the different members of the family .",
    "however , in the case of the present work there is a difference , namely the various models of the family have a relatively similar evolution even for large differences in the parameter @xmath93 .",
    "in the previous section we described how we can construct @xmath0 models that exhibit the same behavior at the background level with any given dynamical dark energy ( dde ) scenario . furthermore , we showed how the examination of perturbations can be used in order to distinguish the dde scenario from the various members of the reconstructed @xmath0 family , as well as these various members from each other . in the present section , in order to provide specific examples , we apply these procedures in the well - known dynamical dark energy scenario of quintessence .    in the quintessence paradigm ,",
    "the dark energy sector is attributed to a homogeneous scalar field @xmath104 , while the matter sector is described by a pressureless perfect fluid with energy density @xmath40 @xcite . in the case of flat geometry",
    "the friedman equation reads [ fr1 ] h^2= , where @xmath105 is the scalar - field potential . in these models",
    ", the field typically rolls down a very shallow potential , eventually coming to rest when it can find a local minimum .",
    "in particular , the evolution equation for @xmath104 reads : @xmath106 while the corresponding one for @xmath40 is @xmath107 additionally , one can define the effective dark energy density and pressure in field terms as @xmath108 and thus the corresponding dark - energy equation - of - state parameter as @xmath109 which obviously present a dynamical behavior in general .",
    "finally , in such a scenario , the growth of perturbations is governed by the linearized einstein equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the velocity potential of the matter fluid and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath104 .",
    "one last subject that has to be settled before proceeding forward is the choice of the quintessence potential @xmath105 . amongst the various ansatzes of the literature , in this work we focus on three commonly studied cases , namely :    1 .",
    "the pseudo - nambu - goldstone - boson ( pngb ) model : [ pngb ] v@xmath104=a^4 @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the energy scale of the potential , and @xmath71 is a symmetry restoration scale .",
    "this model was first proposed in @xcite , while its cosmological applications were discussed in @xcite .",
    "2 .   the exponential model : v@xmath104=a^4 @xmath114 , [ exp ] where @xmath115 is the planck mass .",
    "exponential potentials arise in a variety of contexts , such as higher dimensional gravitational theories , moduli fields , and also non - perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "3 .   the power law model : [ powerlaw ] v@xmath104=a^4+n ^-n .",
    "power law potentials have been studied extensively in @xcite , and have been shown to arise in the context of susy in @xcite .",
    "the usual method of differentiating various types of dde models is to examine their phase - space behavior , focusing in particular on the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter and its evolution @xcite .",
    "the various models can either fall into a `` thawing '' or `` freezing '' category .",
    "the former is thusly named because the field is only recently beginning to exhibit dynamical behavior since it is being frozen at some distance from its minimum due to hubble friction , while the name of the latter arises form the fact that it is dynamical throughout much of the universe s history but it becomes frozen into place at late times ( during the time of dark energy domination ) . amongst the three choices above , the first two are thawing models while the third one is a freezing model .",
    "let us now reconstruct an @xmath0 cosmology that exhibits the same behavior at the background level with a given quintessence scenario . as described in subsection [ ftqequiv ] , the corresponding @xmath0 family of models",
    "is given by relation ( [ fsol ] ) , where in the quintessence case the dark energy density @xmath72 is given by ( [ rhoddequint ] ) , while the cosmological equations close by ( [ fr1])-([rhomevol ] ) .    in a non - trivial quintessence scenario , ( [ fsol ] ) can not be solved analytically .",
    "thus , in the following we perform a numerical elaboration in the case of the three quintessence models described above . in particular , knowing the evolution of @xmath72 and of the effective dark - energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath46 for the three quintessence models , we numerically reconstruct the corresponding @xmath0 family using ( [ fsol ] ) , and then we numerically extract the @xmath46-behavior using ( [ wft ] ) .    for the three quintessence potentials we suitably choose the parameter values in order for @xmath46 to lie within its observational limits -1<@xmath116<-0.9 for low redshifts @xcite .",
    "we solve the cosmological equations determining the initial conditions at a redshift @xmath84 deep inside the matter dominated era , and we evolve the system until the density parameter of matter @xmath117 becomes equal to @xmath118 at @xmath119 , as it is required by observations . for our numerical analysis , we work in units where @xmath120 and @xmath121 .    in figures [ fpngb]-[fpowerlaw ] we present the reconstructed @xmath0 for the three quintessence models , namely the pseudo - nambu - goldstone - boson ( [ pngb ] ) , the exponential ( [ exp ] ) , and the power - law ( [ powerlaw ] ) models , respectively (",
    "such figures are easily created since we know numerically @xmath122 and @xmath123 , that is @xmath124 , and thus we obtain @xmath0 ) . in each figure",
    ", we depict @xmath0 for four members of the @xmath0 family of models , characterized by four choices of the parameter @xmath93 .",
    "we mention that the @xmath73-term in ( [ fsol ] ) behaves like a decaying mode , as it falls of approximately as @xmath125 during early times , making the @xmath79 ( @xmath99 ) case an attractor for this family of models .",
    "this is demonstrated in figures [ fpngb]-[fpowerlaw ] , where it is clear that the @xmath101 models approach the @xmath99 one , for the reconstructions of all three quintessence scenarios .",
    "finally , note that we have focused only on positive @xmath93-values , since negative values will produce graphs which are symmetrically reflected about the @xmath126 line .    having reconstructed the @xmath0 family of models that corresponds to the three quintessence scenarios , in figures [ wpngb]-[wpowerlaw ] we present the behavior of @xmath127 , which is a basic observable , for each potential respectively , according to ( [ wddequint ] ) . in each figure , we depict additionally the @xmath127 of the corresponding reconstructed @xmath0 family of models , according to ( [ wft ] ) , for four values of the parameter @xmath93 . as we observe , in all cases there is a perfect overlap of the corresponding figures , which verifies the fact that for background - level quantities , such is the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath46 , any dynamical dark energy scenario is indistinguishable by construction from its corresponding @xmath0 equivalent family of models .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we applied our general @xmath0-reconstruction formalism of section [ ftqequiv ] in the case of quintessence dynamical dark energy scenario . in the present subsection",
    "we investigate the perturbations following subsection [ pertgen ] , in order to distinguish between quintessence and its equivalent family of models .",
    "the perturbation evolution for quintessence is given by equations ( [ pertquintess ] ) , while for the family of @xmath0 models by ( [ poissonf ] ) .",
    "we follow the numerical elaboration described in the background case , and we additionally choose the initial velocity of the metric perturbation to be at zero .    in fig .",
    "[ pngb1000 ] we demonstrate the evolution of the matter overdensity @xmath67 as a function of the redshift , in the case of pseudo - nambu - goldstone - boson ( pngb ) quintessence scenario given by ( [ pngb ] ) , in a scale of @xmath128 mpc@xmath129 , while in fig .",
    "[ pngb1 ] we provide the same graph but in a scale of @xmath130 mpc@xmath129 . in the same figures ,",
    "we additionally depict the @xmath67-evolution for three members of the corresponding reconstructed @xmath0 family , determined by three distinct values of the parameter @xmath93 ( @xmath131 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "similarly , in figures [ exp1000 ] and [ exp1 ] we provide the corresponding plots for the exponential scenario given by ( [ exp ] ) , while in figures [ powerlaw1000 ] and [ powerlaw1 ] we show the corresponding graphs for the power - law scenario given by ( [ powerlaw ] ) .    from these figures",
    "we observe that the evolution at the perturbation level distinguishes the quintessence scenario from its reconstructed equivalent family of @xmath0 models , as well as the various @xmath0 family members from each other . concerning the scale , as discussed in subsection [ pertgen ] the deviation in @xmath67-evolution is strong for small scales and weak for large scales .",
    "concerning the redshift , for all the models the deviation is negligible for large redshifts @xmath132 , which is expected since the universe is matter dominated at that time and the dark - energy sector ( dde or @xmath0 ) plays no role in determining the growth of perturbations .",
    "moreover , note that that the shape of the @xmath133-curve differs fundamentally from that of the @xmath134-curves .",
    "therefore , it is possible to choose a value of @xmath93 such that @xmath67 and @xmath96 coincide at a particular redshift , but they will not coincide at other redshifts for this particular choice of @xmath93 .",
    "finally , as we can see , in general the parameter @xmath93 has a very weak impact on the splitting of @xmath67-evolutions , even for small scales - the difference between the @xmath135 and the @xmath136 cases is modest in all the cases considered .",
    "this is most likely a result of the attractor nature of the @xmath99 solution described in [ ftquintess ] .",
    "in this work we investigated @xmath0 cosmology in both the background , as well as in the perturbation level , as a way to mimic the behavior of a given model of dynamical dark energy .",
    "@xmath0 gravity is the extension of the `` teleparallel '' equivalent of general relativity , which uses the zero curvature weitzenbck connection instead of the torsionless levi - civita connection , in the same lines as @xmath2 gravity is the extension of standard general relativity .",
    "first , we presented the general formalism for reconstructing the @xmath0 scenario that effectively leads to the same behavior with any given cosmological model , at the background level .",
    "as we showed , for a given dynamical dark energy scenario , one can reconstruct its equivalent , one - parameter family of models .",
    "although they exhibit completely indistinguishable background behavior , the perturbations can break the above degeneracy .",
    "that is , the growth history is different for the given cosmological scenario as well as for each member of the corresponding reconstructed @xmath0 family .    in order to present our results",
    "more transparently , we applied the aforementioned general formalism in the well known case of quintessence dynamical dark energy scenario . after reconstructing the @xmath0 family for three quintessence scenarios",
    ", we numerically extracted the evolution of the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter , which is a basic observable . since it is a background quantity it leads to identical behavior for quintessence as well as for its @xmath0 equivalent .",
    "however , upon examining the perturbations , and in particular the evolution of the matter overdensity , we do acquire a way to distinguish between quintessence and its @xmath0 equivalent family , as well as between the infinite members of the reconstructed @xmath0 family . more specifically",
    ", the deviation is strong for small scales and weak for large scales , and additionally it is negligible for large redshifts ( @xmath132 ) , since there the universe is matter dominated with a negligible dark - energy sector .    in summary",
    ", @xmath0 gravity can effectively mimic any dynamical dark energy cosmological scenario at the background level .",
    "the perturbation analysis can break this degeneracy leading to rejection or acceptance of specific @xmath0 models .",
    "these features make @xmath0 cosmology an interesting candidate for the description of nature , which requires deeper examination .",
