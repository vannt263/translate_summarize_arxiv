    "type ia supernovae ( sn  ia ) are an important subclass of supernova ( sn ) that are thought to arise from explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems , although the exact nature of their progenitor systems is largely a mystery .",
    "this ignorance is not due to a lack of effort since sn  ia are the subject of intense scrutiny , not least of all because of their importance as cosmological probes .",
    "sn  ia have been used to measure the hubble constant @xcite and have even given strong evidence for a non - zero cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "our failure to identify sn  ia progenitors highlights a major gap in our understanding of stellar evolution in binary systems , and presents a stumbling - block to understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies , since ia s are known to be efficient producers of iron .",
    "in addition , until sn  ia progenitor systems are clearly identified , it will remain difficult to convincingly eliminate evolutionary sources of systematic error in the observed trend of sn brightness with redshift .",
    "the current model framework for type ia sne involves carbon deflagration / detonation in a white dwarf driven close to the chandrasekhar limit by accretion .",
    "the most likely type of progenitor system @xcite is a c - o white dwarf accreting h / he - rich gas from a companion , either from its wind or through roche lobe overflow .",
    "double degenerate scenarios with coalescing pairs of c - o white dwarfs are also possible , while sub - chandrasekhar - mass white dwarfs are less likely @xcite . in the non - coalescing scenarios , there will be circumstellar gas whose composition and geometry depend on the nature of the progenitor system .",
    "if the circumstellar medium ( csm ) emits radiation , or absorbs radiation from the sn , this can be used to distinguish between types of progenitor systems .",
    "thermal x - ray emission is expected to arise from the hot gas in the interaction region between the rapidly moving supernova ejecta and the wind from presupernova mass loss . detecting this x - ray emission",
    "offers a direct and potentially quite sensitive probe of the amount of csm . because of its high sensitivity , broad bandwidth , unprecedented imaging capability , and ability to respond rapidly to a target of opportunity ( too ) request , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _  is the premier instrument to search for faint x - ray emission from transient point sources .    in the following",
    "we present the analysis and interpretation of _ chandra _  observations of four recent sne  ia .",
    "two are fairly normal sne  ia , while the others are peculiar cases showing strong h@xmath5 emission from circumstellar interaction .",
    "the following section describes the observed targets ,  3 presents the observations and techniques , ",
    "4 uses the upper limits on x - ray flux to constrain the nature of the csm , and the final section concludes . in an appendix we describe the x - ray properties of the host galaxies for the two nearby systems , ngc  3190 and ngc  1371 .",
    "our first targeted sn , sn  2002bo , was discovered on 2002 march 9 @xcite and was spectroscopically confirmed as a type ia sn shortly thereafter @xcite .",
    "the sn appeared approximately 18@xmath8 southeast of the nucleus of ngc  3190 in the middle of an apparent dust lane .",
    "early optical spectra of the sn indicated that it was quite young ( 1014 days before maximum ) and possibly reddened .",
    "based on the sn s proximity to earth and very early discovery , we triggered a pre - approved _ chandra _  too observation on march 12 .",
    "the nominally 20 ks long observation was carried out two days later ( the midpoint of the observation was at jd 2452347.9 ) .",
    "we now know that the time of maximum light ( in the b band ) occurred on 2002 march 23.0 ut or , equivalently jd 2452356.5 , @xcite and that the inferred explosion epoch was jd 2452338.6 @xmath9 0.5 .",

    "although the background rate is higher here than on the front - side illuminated chips of the imaging array , the greatly enhanced low energy response of chip s3 was the main deciding factor in favor of using it .",

    "light curves of the entire s3 chip were made to identify times of high background .",
    "the sn  2002bo , sn  2005gj , and sn  2005ke data were mostly free of flares , while the sn  2002ic data showed a modest amount of background flaring . excluding time intervals more than 3 @xmath13 from the mean resulted in final useful exposure times of 19620 s ( sn  2002bo ) ,",

    "we found no unambiguous matches between x - ray and optical point sources in the field of sn  2002bo , so it was not possible to obtain an independent check of the absolute astrometry of the x - ray data . in lieu of this",

    "there were nine optical counterparts to x - ray sources in the sn  2005gj field which resulted in an aspect correction of 1.0@xmath8 to the _ chandra _  data .",
    "one x - ray source showed a clear optical counterpart for the sn  2005ke observation .",
    "the positional offset was less than 0.1@xmath8 so no adjustment was applied to the _ chandra _  astrometry .",
    "grayscale images of the _ chandra _  data are presented in figures  [ bo_soft_img][ke_soft_img ] in two spectral bands : 0.52 kev ( left ) and 2 - 6 kev ( right ) .",
    "the small insert in the lower right corner of each panel shows the raw _ chandra _  data in the immediate vicinity of each sn .",
    "there are no detected x - ray photons in a 1@xmath8 ( radius ) circle centered on the positions of either sn  2002bo or sn  2005ke .",
    "only two photons ( with energies of approximate 1.1 kev and 3.6 kev ) were detected at the position of sn  2002ic .",
    "two photons ( with energies of 4.0 kev and 7.7 kev ) were also detected at the position of sn  2002gj these are clearly not significant detections and",
    "so in the following we demonstrate how we obtained upper limits to the x - ray flux of each sn .",
    "since the range of allowed spectral models is large , we developed a technique that allows us to determine upper limits for just about any spectral form imaginable .",
    "[ bo_hard_img ]    [ ic_hard_img ]    [ gj_hard_img ]    [ ke_hard_img ]    one essential key to our method is to obtain an accurate spectral model for the background .",
    "to this end we extracted spectra from the large circular regions shown on figures  [ bo_soft_img][ke_soft_img ] , excluding all serendipitous point sources and for each of sn  2002bo and sn  2002ke , an elliptical region centered on the host galaxy that encompasses all the galaxy s apparent x - ray emission .",
    "the detector spectral response function ( calculated using mkacisrmf ) as well as the overall effective area function were determined at a large number of detector positions within the extraction region and then weighted by the spatial distribution of detected events to produce final weighted response functions .",
    "the black data points near the bottom of figures  [ bo_spec ] and [ ke_spec ] show the background spectra used for sn  2002bo and sn  2005ke ( the other cases are similar to these two ) .",
    "note that the spectra were rebinned to a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath63 for display only ; spectral fits were carried out on the original unbinned spectral data .",
    "the curve through these points indicates our best fit model , which consists of two power law components to describe the non - x - ray ( i.e. , particle ) background , three narrow lines to account for instrumental fluorescence lines from si and au , and two astrophysical models : a low temperature thermal model for the local galactic emission and a hard power law for the unresolved cosmic x - ray background .",
    "these later models included interstellar absorption using the galactic values @xcite : @xmath23 ( sn  2002bo ) , @xmath24 ( sn  2002ic ) , @xmath25 ( sn  2005gj ) , and @xmath26 ( sn  2005ke ) .",
    "one of the non - x - ray background power law models is required to model the spectrum below @xmath65 kev ; the other one fits the sharp upturn in emission beyond 7 kev .",
    "overall the non - x - ray background dominates the spectrum above about 2 kev .",
    "the fits were carried out using a maximum likelihood figure - of - merit function for poisson - distributed data ( the so - called `` c - stat '' option in xspec ) .",
    "the background models for all four targets are similar as are the quality of the fits , which are acceptable from a statistical point - of - view ( determined by examining the @xmath27 values on grouped data ) .",
    "detector spectral response and effective area functions were calculated as above for the sn regions .",
    "we assume that the background intensity is uniform on arcminute spatial scales near the detector aimpoint and that its spectral form does not vary with position either .",
    "thus we can scale the background models to the sn regions using the ratio of detector pixels in the source and background spectral extraction regions .",
    "when this is done , we find that the background model predicts the detection of 0.19 events ( sn  2002bo ) , 0.20 events ( sn  2002ic ) , 0.50 events ( sn  2005gj ) , and 0.14 events ( sn  2005ke ) over the entire chandra band .",
    "the number of events actually detected in the observations of sn  2002bo and sn  2005ke ( 0 for each ) is consistent with their respective background rates .",
    "the poisson probability to detect 2 ( or more ) x - ray photons when 0.2 are expected , as is the case for sn  2002ic , is only 1.7% .",
    "the poisson probability to detect 2 ( or more ) x - ray photons purely from background in the case of sn  2005gj is 9% .",
    "we determine flux upper limits for a specific assumed astrophysical spectral model ( including the measured redshifts for sn  2002ic and sn  2005gj ) , by adding it to the background model and then increasing its normalization until the c - stat value increases by @xmath28 , which is the 3 @xmath13 confidence level criterion .",
    "results for two x - ray flux bands are shown in tables  [ tab_bo ] to [ tab_ke ] and plots of the variation of the c - stat value vs.  the total 0.510 kev band x - ray flux are shown in fig .",
    "all quoted fluxes have been corrected to remove galactic absorption for sn  2002ic , sn  2005gj , and sn  2005ke , and the absorption from the host galaxy for sn  2002bo .",
    "the first set of four models in these tables ( dashed curves in the figure ) assume thermal plasma emission with no intrinsic absorption , normal solar composition and temperatures from 2 to 20 kev .",
    "the second set of four models ( solid curves in the figure ) assume a hot ( @xmath29 kev ) bremsstrahlung model with varying amounts of intrinsic absorption : from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "uncertainty in the level of the background has a very small effect on the flux upper limits .",
    "for example , assuming a 20% variation in the level of the model background for sn  2002ic introduces a @xmath63% change in the derived flux limit for the hard spectral model .",

    "this is close to the ratio of effective areas at 1.5 kev for the two observatories ( 135 @xmath104 / 600 @xmath104 @xmath105 0.225 ) , which is shown as the short dashed line in the figure .",
    "the six sources that deviate from the average ratio of rates do so by generally no more than about a factor of two and are likely just time variable sources .",
    "having demonstrated the astrometric and photometric accuracy of the swift data , we are now in the position to determine the x - ray count rate and detection significance of sn  2005ke .",
    "first we note that the count rate of @xmath106 s@xmath2 quoted by @xcite would lead us to expect something like 25 detected photons , after background subtraction , within our fiducial 9@xmath8 radius circular region .",

    "the modeled x - ray flux is clearly dominated by the emission of the forward shock ; emission from the reverse shock is absorbed by the cool dense shell formed in the radiative ejecta .",
    "we compared this spectrum to the _ chandra _  data and found that the x - ray flux exceeds the observational upper limit by a factor of @xmath170 .",
    "the disagreement is significant and indicates that the model is incorrectly predicting the x - ray emission from the forward shock .",
    "the model ignores possible deviation from spherical symmetry suggested by polarization data @xcite .",
    "generally , if the cs gas is concentrated in a dense thin equatorial disk ( thickness @xmath171 radius ) , it is conceivable that the bulk of the kinetic energy of the interaction could be dissipated deep inside the sn envelope . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of the emergent x - ray flux to the optical flux could be small because of strong absorption in the dense disk .",
    "however this is unlikely to be the case . indeed ,",
    "large deviations from global spherical symmetry for the interaction are ruled out by the similarity of line widths and profiles for all known sn  ia with strong cs interaction , i.e. , 2002ic , 1999e , 1997cy ( ccl ) .",
    "furthermore a modest level of asymmetry should not significantly affect the ratio of the emergent - to - absorbed x - ray luminosity compared to the spherical case .",
    "more serious consequences for the x - ray luminosity might result from the omission of the internal structure of the forward shock in the thin shell approximation . to estimate the error introduced by this approximation we computed a hydrodynamical model for the standard parameter set as before ( ccl ) using a one - dimension hydrodynamical lagrangian code with artifical viscosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on day 260 the radius of the contact discontinuity of the hydrodynamical model coincides with the radius of the thin shell model to an accuracy of 1% .",
    "the forward shock structure of the hydrodynamical model was used to calculate the x - ray emission from the shocked gas assuming instant equilibration of ion and electron temperatures .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the forward and reverse shocks is lower by factors of 1.5 and 1.3 , respectively , compared to the thin shell model , while the temperature of the forward shock is greater ( 80 kev compared to 50 kev in the thin shell model ) .",
    "the lower x - ray luminosity of both shocks in the hydro model results in an optical luminosity lower by a factor of 1.3 . to recover the optical bolometric luminosity the cs density in the hydro model",
    "needs to be slightly larger .",
    "we found that a @xmath10520% increase in the cs density is sufficient to recover the required optical luminosity .",
    "the new total mass of the cs envelope is @xmath1051.9 @xmath172 within a @xmath173 cm radius compared to @xmath1051.6 @xmath172 found in the thin shell approximation ( ccl ) .",
    "the increase of the cs density by 20% slightly increases the x - absorption thus reducing the peak of the x - ray flux by less than 20% .",
    "we thus conclude that differences between the hydrodynamical and thin shell models are rather minor and can not account for the significant disparity between the _ chandra _  upper limit and the predicted x - ray flux .",
    "two missing factors that could potentially resolve the issue are the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability of the cds and clumping of the cs gas .",
    "the rt instability of the shocked decelerated ejecta is a generic attribute of the sn / cs interaction @xcite , while the clumpiness of the cs matter around sn  2002ic has been invoked already to account for the h@xmath5 line profile ( ccl ) .",
    "the rt instability leads to fragmentation and mixing of cds fragments with the hot gas of the forward shock @xcite .",
    "clumpiness of the cs matter favors more efficient mixing of the cds fragments within the forward shock principally through two mechanisms .",
    "first , the cs clouds penetrate deep inside the intercloud shock before they get shocked , fragmented and mixed @xcite . as a result",
    "the bulk of the kinetic energy related to cs clouds dissipates closer to the contact discontinuity .",
    "second , the cs clouds engulfed by the intercloud shock generate vortex turbulence that favors more efficient penetration of the rt spikes in the forward shock @xcite .",
    "we thus propose a scenario for sn  2002ic in which the forward shock is no longer a regular layer of hot gas but instead is a macroscopic _ mixture of hot gas and cool metal - rich fragments _ of the cds .",
    "the major outcome of this modification should be an additional component of absorption of the x - ray emission from the forward shock by the intermixed fragments of metal - rich cds .    to illustrate this effect we will calculate the absorption of x - rays from the forward and reverse shocks assuming the same thin shell model as in ccl , but with the following corrections .",
    "the cds is assumed to be fragmented and homogeneously mixed in the forward shock layer .",
    "remarkably , the analysis of the optical spectrum of sn  2002ic suggests that the cds is indeed fragmented and well mixed .",
    "the ratio of the cumulative area of clumps to the area of the spherical shell , which is a measure of mixing , was estimated to be @xmath174 on day 234 ( ccl ) .",

    "small values of the occultation optical depth , @xmath176 , would mimic the possible presence of `` holes '' in the mixing zone due to strong angular variation in the column density @xcite .",
    "another relevant value is the average optical depth for x - rays @xmath177 , which is determined by the average column density of cds material and the x - ray absorption coefficient , for which we take the metal - rich case as given above .",
    "the effective optical depth of the ensemble of fragments is then @xmath178 $ ] . in the limit @xmath179",
    "the effect of mixing for a homogeneous thin spherical layer with unabsorbed luminosity @xmath180 is to reduce the emergent x - ray luminosity to a value of @xmath181 .",
    "indeed , only half of the photons emitted in a layer with thickness equal to the mean free path ( @xmath182 ) can escape .",
    "the other factor of one - half comes from averaging over the angle between the photon direction and surface normal .",
    "the mixing we invoke may , however , be incomplete , which can be mimicked by adopting a lower occultation optical depth of the homogeneous layer , @xmath183 .",
    "we also take into account additional absorption by the fragmented shocked cs clouds with normal composition , assuming that 50% of the swept - up cs gas resides in the cool shocked cloud material with @xmath184 .",

    "the case @xmath186 corresponds to the maximal flux tolerated by the _",

    "this study indicates that mixing of the shocked sn ejecta with the hot gas of the forward shock can resolve the x - ray flux disparity between the original model that explains the optical spectrum ( ccl ) and the new _ chandra _  observations of sn  2002ic .",
    "according to its early spectrum and photometry , sn  2005gj is remarkably similar to sn  2002ic and very likely is a member of this new class of bright ia sne embedded in dense cs envelope .",
    "this position has been strengthened by the recent light curve and spectral study of @xcite .",
    "their v- and i - band light curves for sn  2005gj match the shape of the early time evolutionary models of @xcite for sn  2002ic , although the models need to be scaled upward in brightness by 0.5 mag or so .",
    "the csm interaction in sn  2005gj is evidentally stronger than in sn  2002ic . in the absence of a detailed hydrodynamical model for sn  2005gj",
    ", we utilize the same model and parameter values as for sn  2002ic .",
    "first we computed the x - ray flux at the _ chandra _  observation epoch ( @xmath187 d ) neglecting the effects of ejecta mixed into the forward shock .",
    "the resulting spectrum is presented in the upper panel of fig .",

    "the model spectrum overpredicts the x - ray flux by a factor of 4 .",
    "although little is currently published about the environment of sn  2005gj , the @xcite study suggests that the density of the ambient medium is , if anything , higher than that around sn  2002ic , which exacerbates the discrepancy with the _",
    "chandra_flux limit .",
    "therefore we next considered the mixing of cds fragments into the forward shock region in the case of sn  2005gj .",
    "the required occultation optical depth to not exceed the _",
    "chandra _",
    "limit is @xmath189 ( fig .  [ gj_mod ] ) .",
    "consequently , if the cs environment around sn  2005gj is as dense as that around sn  2002ic , mixing of the fragmented cds must be already significant at this early epoch .",
    "with our _ chandra _  observation of sn  2002bo we have set the most sensitive x - ray flux upper limits at an earlier epoch than for any previous sn  ia .",
    "the previous best case was that of sn  1992a for which a _ rosat _  upper limit of @xmath6@xmath190 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath2 was set on the 0.5 - 2 kev band x - ray flux @xmath635 days after explosion @xcite .",
    "our _ chandra _  limit in the same energy band is an order of magnitude lower and was set only 9 days after explosion .",
    "we also set a sensitive upper limit in the important 210 kev band .",
    "converting our flux upper limits to constraints on the density of the csm in the system depends on uncertain assumptions about the thermodynamic state of the hot plasma in the expanding ejecta and shocked wind . as we have shown in this paper",
    "there is roughly an order of magnitude difference in the inferred wind density under the assumption of fully equilibrated electron and ion temperatures vs.the case with non - equilibrated temperatures .",
    "the latter case yields the more conservative ( i.e. , higher ) constraint : a wind density parameter @xmath191 g cm@xmath2 . in terms of a slow wind with velocity of @xmath192",
    "km s@xmath2 this corresponds to a upper limit on the mass - loss rate of @xmath193 yr@xmath2 .",
    "the much higher sensitivity of the _ chandra _  data notwithstanding , this value is _ larger _ by a factor of 10 or so than the mass loss upper limit derived from _ rosat _  data by @xcite for sn  1992a .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the simplicity of the model used by @xcite to evaluate their upper limit : they do not include absorption by residual wind material above the forward shock , assume electron - ion temperature equilibration , compare to model luminosities without applying a bolometric correction , and calculate the sn age from the time of maximum rather than from the time of explosion .",
    "in other comparisons our _ chandra _  upper limit is comparable to those found previously from limits on the h@xmath5 flux for the normal type ia supernovae sn  1994d @xcite and sn  2001el @xcite . in general limits on @xmath127 of @xmath6@xmath194",
    "yr@xmath2 are not stringent enough to rule out the class of symbiotic - type binaries as sn  ia progenitors at least not for these particular cases .",
    "the value of these results lies in our ability to calculate , using well understood physics , the expected x - ray emission from hot gas . viewed in this light , we briefly discuss limits on the csm obtained from radio nondetections of a number of nearby sne  ia @xcite .",
    "the radio results rely on semi - empirical parameterized functional forms for the time- and frequency - dependence of synchrotron emission and free - free absorption , whose relevant parameters are assumed to have values given by radio results for sne  ib / c .",
    "likewise the essential parameter , i.e. , the one linking the wind density parameter to the radio luminosity of the sn , can not be calculated from theory with any accuracy , and an empirical calibration , again drawn from measurements of sne  ib / c , must be used .",
    "although the sensitive radio flux limits clearly argue for low density environments around sn  ia , the extremely low numerical limits on the mass - loss rates claimed by @xcite can not yet be considered definitive .",
    "the other normal sn  ia we study here is sn  2002ke .",
    "we re - examine the claim by @xcite of a tentative x - ray detection by swift and find that we can not substantiate it .",
    "we pay particular attention to the astrometric and photometric calibration of the swift x - ray data by comparing to a _",
    "chandra _",
    "observation done several months later .",
    "we find no evidence for a significant x - ray detection of sn  2005ke by either swift or _",
    "chandra _ , to a flux limit that is several factors higher than what we obtained for sn  2002bo .",
    "since this limit is at a much later epoch , when the intensity of the csm / ejecta interaction should be much reduced , we did not attempt to determine numerical limits to the wind density parameter for this sn .    we have also presented _ chandra _  upper limits for the two examples of sne ia with clear evidence for circumstellar interaction : sn  2002ic and sn  2005gj .",
    "the upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of sn  2002ic in the @xmath195 kev band unexpectedly reveals a serious drawback to the interaction model proposed previously ( ccl ) : the predicted x - ray flux turns out to be larger by at least a factor of four .",
    "we identified the major missing element of the model responsible for the controversy : macroscopic mixing of cool metal - rich ejecta fragments into the hot gas of the forward shock , which results in strong absorption of the x - rays emitted by the forward shock .",
    "interestingly , the absorption of x - rays by mixed shocked ejecta should have the effect of decreasing the required cs density in the model to explain the late time optical luminosity .",
    "this effect together with the higher radiation efficiency of the interaction with a clumpy cs matter should result in a slightly higher expansion velocity of the shocked sn ejecta in the interaction model .",
    "these outcomes appear to be preferred by the optical spectra of sn  2002ic ( see ccl ) .",
    "sn  2005gj appears to belong to the sn  2002ic - like family of sn  ia with dense cs envelopes @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _  upper limit from this object at about day 80 is a factor of four larger than the flux predicted by the interaction model of sn  2002ic recomputed for the corresponding epoch .",
    "although the strength of the interaction argues against it , one possible explanation is that the cs density around sn  2005gj is just somewhat lower than around sn  2002ic .",
    "a better possibility invokes mixing of the shocked ejecta , which can reduce the emergent x - ray flux . which of these is more likely to be the correct explanation requires a better understanding of the environment of sn  2005gj than we have at present .",
    "future studies of the optical light curve and spectra of this interesting object are strongy encouraged .    resolving the issue of the x - ray non - detection of sn  2002ic - like objects has its dark side due to our introduction of the parameter @xmath196 , which is essentially incalculable .",
    "even three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are unlikely to be able to recover this value in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "we , therefore , can predict in detail neither the spectrum nor the evolution of the x - ray flux from sn  2002ic - like supernovae .",
    "two relevant remarks can be made , however .",
    "first , in the case of sn  2002ic the model without mixing predicts an increasing x - ray flux in the band below 10 kev up until day @xmath6400 ( ccl ) . therefore , x - ray detection at earlier epochs is unlikely to be more favorable , as the lack of detection of sn  2005gj at roughly 80 days after explosion ( versus 260 days for sn  2002ic ) tends to support .",
    "the second remark relates to the spectrum of the emergent x - ray emission : hard x - rays ( i.e. , with photon energies greater than @xmath620 kev ) are not affected by the absorption that mutes the lower energy flux ( see fig .  [ ic_mod ] ) .",
    "future sensitive x - ray observations covering a wider energy band ( @xmath197 kev ) , therefore , should reveal a sn  2002ic - like event as a strongly absorbed hard x - ray source and thus verify the proposed mixing scenario .",
