    "the characteristic method tackles the time derivative term and the nonlinear convective term together ; we use it to solve the considered equation with first order accuracy in time .",
    "it seems that the advantages of the characteristic methods can be listed as : 1 ) efficient in solving the advection - dominated diffusion problems ; 2 ) easily obtaining the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the discretized system ; 3 ) making the nonlinear equations linear , conveniently tackling the nonlinear obstacles ; 4 ) easily performing the numerical stability analysis . another idea to treat the nonlinear term is to use the technique of operator splitting @xcite .",
