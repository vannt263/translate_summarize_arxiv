    "the fundamental role of a nonperturbative pion cloud surrounding the nucleon is well explained in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as a consequence of the spontaneously - broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the pion cloud associated with chiral - symmetry breaking was first discussed in the context of deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) by feynman  @xcite and sullivan  @xcite .",
    "as realized by thomas  @xcite , it can give an explanation of the flavor - symmetry violation in the sea - quark distributions of the nucleon thus naturally accounting for the excess of @xmath1 ( anti)quarks over @xmath2 ( anti)quarks as observed through the violation of the gottfried sum rule  @xcite .",
    "although the nucleon s nonperturbative antiquark sea can not be ascribed entirely to its virtual meson cloud  @xcite , the role of mesons in understanding these data has been extensively discussed in connection with parton distributions ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a similar important role is expected to be played by the meson cloud in the case of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) that have recently been introduced and discussed in connection with deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and hard exclusive meson production ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . due to their intrinsic nonperturbative nature gpds can not be calculated directly within qcd . up to now",
    ", only first results of their mellin moments have been obtained by lattice calculations  ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "therefore , in order to guide the planning of possible experiments one has still to rely on models .",
    "the first calculation performed in the mit bag model  @xcite did not consider the pion cloud explicitly .",
    "further calculations have been performed in the chiral quark - soliton model @xcite .",
    "the model is based on an effective relativistic quantum field theory where the instanton fluctuations of the gluon field are simulated by a pion field binding the constituent quarks inside the nucleon .",
    "the model is theoretically justified in the limit of the large number of colors @xmath3 , and in the leading order in the @xmath4 expansion it is not possible to obtain results for separate flavors , only special flavour combinations being nonzero .",
    "gpds have also been calculated within the nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite . a first attempt to explicitly include",
    "the meson cloud in a model calculation of gpds has been discussed in ref .",

    "a complete and exact overlap representation of gpds has recently been worked out within the framework of light - cone quantization  @xcite .",
    "a fock - state decomposition of the hadronic state is performed in terms of @xmath5-parton fock states with coefficients representing the momentum light - cone wavefunction ( lcwf ) of the @xmath5 partons .",
    "the same approach has been followed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where gpds both in the chiral - even and chiral - odd sector were derived assuming that at the low - energy scale valence quarks can be interpreted as the constituent quarks treated in constituent quark models ( cqms ) .",
    "this assumption is based on the idea that there exists a scale @xmath6 where the short range ( perturbative ) part of the interaction is negligible and , therefore , the glue and sea are suppressed , while a long range ( confining ) part of the interaction produces a proton composed by ( three ) valence quarks , mainly  @xcite .",
    "jaffe and ross  @xcite proposed to ascribe the quark model calculations of matrix elements to that hadronic scale @xmath7 . in this way , quark models summarizing a great deal of hadronic properties may substitute for low - energy parametrizations , while evolution to larger momentum @xmath8 is dictated by perturbative qcd . in this paper",
    ", we will study the possibility of integrating meson - cloud effects into the valence - quark contribution to gpds .",
    "along the lines originally proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , a meson - baryon fock - state expansion is used to construct the state @xmath9 of the physical nucleon . in the one - meson approximation",
    "the state @xmath9 is pictured as being part of the time a bare nucleon , @xmath10 , and part of the time a baryon - meson system , @xmath11 . in this framework , it will be shown how to apply the convolution approach used for the standard parton distributions in deep inelastic scattering  @xcite to the case of gpds .",
    "the main idea of the convolution approach is that there are no interactions among the particles in a multi - particle fock state during the interaction with the hard photon .",
    "therefore the external probe can scatter either on the bare nucleon , @xmath10 , or on one of the constituents of the higher fock states , @xmath11 .",
    "in the socalled dglap region , with one ( anti)quark emitted and reabsorbed by the physical nucleon , the gpds are obtained by folding the quark gpds within bare constituents ( nucleons , pions , deltas , etc . ) with the probability amplitudes describing the distribution of these constituents in the dressed initial and final nucleon .",
    "in contrast , in the socalled erbl region where a @xmath12 pair is emitted from the initial nucleon , the gpds are obtained from the overlap between wavefunctions of fock states with different parton number , which corresponds , in the meson cloud model , to the contribution of the interference terms between the @xmath11 component in the initial state and the bare nucleon in the final state .",
    "the model is revisited in section  [ wf_mcm ] where all the necessary ingredients that one can find scattered in the literature are consistently rederived to construct the lcwf in the meson cloud model .",
    "the definition of the unpolarized gpds are introduced in section  [ gpds ] , and the convolution formulas for the gpds in the meson cloud model are explicitly derived in section  [ gpds_mcm ] . in section  [ model ]",
    "we describe the model calculation considering the case of a pure pion cloud , and assuming a constituent quark model to construct the lcwfs of the bare nucleon and the constituents of the baryon - meson fock state .",
    "numerical results are discussed in section  [ results ] and some conclusions are drawn in the final section .",
    "derivation of auxiliary quantities is detailed in three appendices .",
    "the basic assumption throughout this paper is that the physical nucleon @xmath13 is made of a bare nucleon @xmath5 dressed by the surrounding meson cloud so that the state of the physical nucleon is decomposed according to the meson - baryon fock - state expansion as a superposition of a bare nucleon state and states containing virtual mesons associated with recoiling baryons .",
