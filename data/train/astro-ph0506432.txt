    "the systematic study of the nfw density fits to many simulated halos shows that their mass accretion history is closely correlated with the concentration parameter @xmath21 and , therefore , with the mass inside the scale radius @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the formation process of the dark matter halos can be generally understood by an early phase of fast mass accretion and a late phase of slow accretion of mass . in this scenario",

    "this is a clear sign of a virialized object . at larger distances the fluctuations in the velocity increase , but not dramatically if we compare those fluctuations with the rms velocities .",
    "the smaller halo on the right has a narrow dip ( @xmath65 ) at @xmath66 apparently due to a satellite , which is moving into the halo .",
    "the surprising result is what we _ do not _ find , i.e. , there is no infall on the two halos .",
    "this may seem like a fluke .",
    "indeed , halos must grow .",
    "their mass must increase with time . in order for the mass to increase",

    "these small radial velocities indicate that halos may extend to radii significantly larger than their formal virial radii .",

    "the problem with the nfw is that it has a slightly wrong shape at radii around @xmath72 : its curvature is a bit too large . in figure",
    "[ fig : fignfw ] this is manifested by an extended hump close to the maximum of the curves at @xmath73 .",
    "one can shift the nfw slightly to the right and down to make the fit more accurate for most of the body of the halo ( @xmath74 ) . in this case",
    "the nfw fit goes below the halo density at small radii @xmath75 , which sometimes was interpreted as if the central slope is steeper than -1 .",
    "overall , the 3d srsic approximation provides remarkable accurate fit .",
    "for @xmath76 the errors are smaller than 5% .",
    "figure  [ fig : isolation ] shows how the density profile depends on particular choice of the isolation criterion . in this case",
    "we selected few hundred halos in the simulation box80 g with masses @xmath77 .",
    "qualitatively the same results are found for halos with different masses .",
    "conclusions are clear : more strict isolation conditions result in smaller density in the outer parts of halos with almost no effect inside the virial radius .",

    "one of the misconceptions , which we had before starting the analysis of the outer regions of dark matter halos is that at large distances the deviations from halo to halo are so large that it is very difficult to talk about average profile or a profile altogether .",
    "this appears to be not true .",
    "figure  [ fig : deviations ] shows the halo to halo rms deviations from the average density profile for halos of a given mass . in order to construct the plot",

    "then the results of different concentrations were averaged .",
    "this splitting into concentrations is needed only for the central region @xmath79 because here the average profile depends on the concentration .",
    "this plot demonstrates that there is no drastic change in the deviations at the virial radius .",
    "the deviations increase with the distance , but they are not unreasonable .    figure  [ fig : infall ] shows the average radial velocity profile for halos of vastly different masses .",
    "we used many dozens of halos for each mass range .",
    "just as in the case of the two individual halos in figure  1 and 2 , there is no systematic infall of material beyond formal virial radius for small virial masses .",
    "the situation is different for group- and cluster- sized halos ( two top panels ) . for these large halos",
    "there are large infall velocities , which amplitude increases with halo mass .",
    "here we obtain the predictions of the spherical collapse model @xcite for the @xmath80 halo density profile and compare them with the results found in the numerical simulations .",
    "the spherical collapse model provides a relationship between the present nonlinear enclosed density contrast , @xmath81 , within a sphere of given radius @xmath82 and the enclosed linear density contrast , @xmath83 , ( i.e. , the initial fluctuation extrapolated to the present using the linear theory ) within the same sphere .",
    "this relationship along with the statistics of the initial fluctuations furnishes definite predictions for the mean density profile .",
    "we expect the spherical collapse model to give the @xmath80 density profile around virialized halos for sufficiently large radii - significantly larger than @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath84 we find a good agreement between the prediction of the spherical model and the @xmath80 density profiles obtained from numerical simulations for several mass ranges . by @xmath80 density profile",
    "we imply any representative profile for a given mass range .",
    "we consider three different representative profiles : the most probable profile , the mean profile and , what we call the typical profile .",
    "this last profile is simply the mean profile in the initial conditions spherically evolved .",
    "our procedure to obtain the typical density profile will be presented in full detail in betancort - rijo et al .",
    "in essence , we use the statistics of the initial gaussian field to obtain the mean profile of the enclosed linear density contrast , @xmath85 , around a proto - halo as a function of the lagrangian distance to the center , @xmath86 .",
    "we then use the spherical collapse model to obtain the present density contrast , @xmath87 , as a function of the present comoving ( i.e. , eulerian ) distance to the center of the halo , @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath88 is the virial radius in lagrangian coordinates , then the enclosed linear contrast @xmath89 must satisfy the condition that @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the linear density contrast within the virial radius @xmath1 at the moment of virialization .",
    "the present average enclosed fractional density @xmath92 is equal to 340 ( the value of overdensity @xmath93 used in our simulations to define the virial radius ) . to obtain @xmath91",
    "we must find the @xmath94 corresponding to a present density contrast equal to 340 .",
    "this condition leads to a @xmath91 value of 1.9 .",
    "we shall later comment on this once we introduce the spherical collapse model .",
    "this condition simply ensures that the proto - halo evolves into an object which at present is virialized within the prescribed virial radius @xmath1 . if this were the only constraint on the linear profile ( equal to the initial profile except for an overall factor ) , it have been shown ( see section 4 in patiri et al .",

    "if the standard spherical collapse model were valid down to the virial radius we could use expression ( [ eq : st ] ) to obtain it :    @xmath121    however , we know that this is not true because bellow @xmath122 virial radius there is substantial amount of shell - crossing that render the mentioned model unappropiate .",

    "it must be noted , however , that by predicted @xmath128 profile we understand simply the one obtained from the corresponding @xmath113 profile by means of relationship given in eq.([eq : eq10 ] ) .",
    "note that this is not the same as the most probable profile for @xmath128 ( see figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the most probable @xmath128 value at a given @xmath142 corresponds to a different halo than the most probable @xmath113 value at the same @xmath143 .",
    "this explains that , while the prediction for @xmath144 agrees very well with the simulations , the agreement is not so good for @xmath145 .",
    "the @xmath145 obtained from @xmath144 by means of expression eq.([eq : eq10 ] ) is not a proper prediction but an indicative value , since we can not envisage a feasible procedure to obtain a proper prediction .",
    "on the contrary , the mean profiles @xmath140 are exactly related to @xmath146 by means of expression eq.([eq : eq10 ] ) .",
    "the predictions for both profiles are in good agreement with the numerical simulations , showing a much flatter profile beyond 2 virial radius than those corresponding to @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this agreement is remarkable given the fact that the expression used for @xmath136 is only a first approximation ( see betancort - rijo et al .",

    "we must use the initial profile given by eq.([eq : eq5]-[eq : eq6 ] ) . if we dropped the second constraint ( that is given in eq.([eq : eq4 ] ) and use in eq.([eq : eq8 ] ) the initial profile given by eq.([eq : eq3 ] ) , which corresponds to high mass objects , the prediction would be the opposite .",
    "the reason for this being that , in this limit , the initial profile depend on mass only through @xmath149 which increases with increasing mass , thereby leading to steeper profiles for larger masses .",
    "as we stated in the introduction , the computations of the @xmath150 profiles ( in fact , the typical profile ) around halos has independently been made by @xcite .",
    "he used the spherical model and , in principle , imposed on the initial profile the same constraint as we do .",
    "the computing procedure he followed was somewhat different involving some approximations .",
    "he do not give explicitly the equation defining the profile , so that accurate comparison with our results are not possible .",
    "furthermore he used different values of @xmath91 , @xmath151 .",
    "however , his results are in good qualitative agreement with our predictions for the typical profile .",
    "we have so far considered randomly chosen halos , i.e. without isolation criteria . when halos are chosen according with an isolation criteria they differ from the randomly chosen ones in two respects . on the one hand ,",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath113 at a given value of @xmath143 is narrower , so that most profiles cluster around the most probable one .",
    "therefore , the difference between the mean and the most probable density profile becomes smaller . on the other hand ,",
    "isolated profiles lay , on average , on somewhat more underdense environment than non - isolated ones , so that their most probable profiles are slightly steeper .",

    "this approach may not be accurate enough given the results presented in this work .",
    "we also find that the isolated galaxy - size halos display all the properties of relaxed objects up to 2 - 3@xmath1 .",

    "the dark matter halos in this mass range do not grow as one naively may expect through a steady accretion of satellites , i.e. , on average there is no mass infall .",
    "this is strikingly different for more massive halos , such as group- and cluster - sized halos which exhibit large infall velocities outside of the formal virial radius . for large halos the amplitude of the infall velocities increases with halo mass .    for larger radii beyond 2 - 3 formal virial radius",
    "we combine the statistics of the initial fluctuations with the spherical collapse model to obtain predictions of the mean halo density profiles for halos with different masses .",

    "we find that the most probable profile obtained from our simulations is in excellent agreement with the predictions from the spherical collapse model beyond 2 - 3 virial radius .",
    "for the mean density profile the predictions are not so accurate .",
    "this is due to the fact that the approximation , which we are using for the distribution of @xmath113 at a given radius , has an artificially long tail ( we are presently working on a better approximation ) .",
    "even so , the predictions are qualitatively good and quantitatively quite acceptable .",
    "we think that the discrepancies between the data and the predictions at radii smaller than 2 - 3 virial radii are due to the fact that these inner shells are affected by the shell - crossing .",
    "we hope that an appropiate treatment of this circunstance will lead to accurate predictions for all radii , so that the mean spherically averaged profiles may be understood in terms of the spherical collapse .",
