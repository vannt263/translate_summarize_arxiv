    "entanglement of composite systems represented by continuous quantum variables is of conceptual importance for studying fundamental questions of quantum mechanics @xcite and promises to be useful for potential real - world applications in the fast developing field of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "however , in general , entanglement is a fragile resource which is easily degraded when it interacts with an uncontrollable environment , for example , in a communication channel in form of a lossy and noisy , optical fiber . in order to overcome this problem of entanglement degradation ,",
    "typically , protocols such as entanglement purification or distillation will be utilized , as originally proposed for qubits @xcite .",
    "these schemes detect errors and are usually probabilistic , as opposed to deterministic approaches such as quantum error correction .",
    "more generally , entanglement distillation can be defined as any scheme that creates one or more entangled pairs of higher entanglement from one or more copies of initially imperfectly entangled pairs by means of local operations and classical communication .",
    "although many impressive experiments for the distillation of pure or mixed discrete - variable entanglement have been reported @xcite , distilling continuous - variable entanglement appears to be rather different and , in general , harder to achieve .",
    "the difficulty arises mainly from the necessity of a non - gaussian element for distilling gaussian entangled states @xcite .",
    "for instance , in order to distill the quantum optical two - mode squeezed state ( tmss ) whose quadratures obey gaussian statistics , one must introduce at least one non - gaussian operation , in form of a non - gaussian ancilla or a non - gaussian measurement .",
    "the so - called photon subtraction ( ps ) strategy , first introduced by opatrn _",
    "@xcite , is one of the experimentally most readily available operations beyond the gaussian regime .",
    "it enables one to modify the gaussian statistics of a given tmss and therefore serves as a possible approach to entanglement distillation of such gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of the ps technique is very simple and can be implemented using a beamsplitter and photon measurements .",
    "after opatrn _",
    "et al.s_ pioneering work @xcite , many efforts have been made to improve the performance of such an entanglement distillation protocol .",
    "@xcite proposed an inconclusive ps method , which employs a more realistic on - off photon detector in order to enhance the entanglement .",
    "@xcite presented a fairly complete theoretical analysis of this type of distillation , including a numerical evaluation of the entanglement before and after distillation .",
    "moreover , a multi - mode theory for frequency mode matching in the photon - subtracting operation was derived @xcite .",
    "even an experiment implementing opatrn s method has already been reported @xcite .",
    "these efforts , both on the theoretical and the experimental side , are examples for the more recent attempts to combine discrete - variable and continuous - variable approaches to optical quantum information processing @xcite .    the original scheme by opatrn _",
    "et al . _ as well as",
    "its theoretical refinements and extensions all refer to a single copy of a _ pure _ , gaussian entangled state which is distilled into a non - gaussian entangled state .",
    "this kind of distillation is sometimes referred to as entanglement concentration , distinct from entanglement purification protocols in which initially mixed - entangled states are purified and thereby turned into states with higher entanglement .",
    "even though usually such entanglement purification is applied to two or more copies of entangled states @xcite , one mixed - entangled copy may also be distilled through local , generalized measurements , similar to those for concentrating a single pure - state copy into a maximally entangled state @xcite . in the mixed - state case , however , both parties sharing the initial state must perform local measurements and communicate their results .    in this paper , we provide a detailed analysis for the one - copy distillation of _ mixed _ continuous - variable entanglement , using beamsplitters and experimentally feasible photon detection techniques . in other words , similar to those one - copy schemes mentioned in the preceding paragraph , we shall consider non - gaussian , generalized measurements locally performed on the two modes of the initial gaussian state .",
    "note that ps ideally corresponds to maps like @xmath0 or @xmath1 , with the photon annihilation operator being non - unitary and the resulting states being not normalized  a manifestation of the probabilistic nature of the ps process .",
    "the corresponding generalized measurements are realized through beam splitter transformations , locally acting on the two signal modes and additional ancilla vacuum modes , and subsequent photon measurements .",
    "note that various experiments have already demonstrated how versatile ps is for non - gaussian state engineering @xcite .",
    "local filters for entanglement concentration of one copy of a pure tmss were previously considered using kerr interactions or cqed @xcite .",
    "multi - copy distillations of noisy versions of a tmss have been proposed as well @xcite .",
    "a further recent one - copy scheme for distilling mixed continuous variable entanglement was proposed in ref .",
    "different from our analysis , this proposal @xcite employs detections of collective excitations in atomic ensembles for the non - gaussian operations .",
    "further , it uses only operational entanglement measures , namely teleportation fidelities . here",
    ", we shall calculate both fidelities and , in particular , logarithmic negativities for the distilled states .    while in the theoretical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial states are pure ( and become mixed only for the case of on - off detections ) , the input states of the recent experiment @xcite were mixed due to experimental imperfections such as the complication to prepare a perfectly pure , minimum - uncertainty squeezed state .",
    "although even the idealized pure - state versions of that experiment slightly differ from the tmsss used in our analysis ( by local squeezing operations ) , the present article also provides a more general theoretical foundation of the experiment described in ref .",
    "it proves the possibility and feasibility of realistic ps - based distillation of a tmss , even in the presence of high losses . at the same time it illuminates",
    "the applicability of opatrn s ps distillation protocol @xcite and provides more details on how to improve entanglement in a general , realistic mixed - state scenario ; for instance , in optical quantum communication using lossy fibers of nearly one attenuation length as potentially used in a quantum repeater @xcite .",

    "following the definitions of ref .",
    "@xcite , we will use the logarithmic negativity as a figure of merit to quantify entanglement .",
    "the logarithmic negativity @xcite is a relatively easily computable measure of entanglement ; more precisely , it is an entanglement monotone , both under local operations and classical communication and under positive partial transpose preserving operations .",
    "the _ logarithmic negativity _ of a bipartite state @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 in which @xmath12 is defined as the _ negativity _ given by the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed density operator @xmath13 . here and throughout , without loss of generality , we will perform the partial transpose operation with respect to the @xmath14-mode .",
    "we shall now quantify the amount of entanglement of the amplitude - damped tmss .",
    "note that this state including the damping effect remains a gaussian state , and hence its logarithmic negativity could be directly computed from its second - moment covariance matrix through the corresponding symplectic eigenvalues of the partially transposed state @xcite . however , for our purposes",
    ", since the ps process will lead to non - gaussian states , it is more useful to achieve a more general entanglement quantification expressed in the photon number basis .",
    "this is similar to the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with the important distinction that our states are mixed states from the beginning , both before and after the distillation .",

    "interestingly , the @xmath2 bounds are similar to the pure - pnr case . for @xmath113 ,",
    "a transmission of @xmath166 is sufficient to enhance the entanglement .",
    "however , as @xmath100 increases , our simulations suggest that a monotonically increasing @xmath8 is required for successful distillation .",
    "in this section , we shall consider quantum teleportation of coherent states in order to assess the quality of the photon - subtracted entangled states .",
    "quantum teleportation is a protocol in which an arbitrary , unknown quantum state can be reliably transferred from a sender to a receiver .",
    "the crucial resource for quantum teleportation to outperform classical teleportation is an entangled state shared by the two participants . intuitively , the more entanglement they share , the higher the teleportation fidelity they can achieve . in other words , the teleportation fidelity may serve as an operational measure of entanglement @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a teleportation experiment in which the entangled state after ps - based distillation is utilized .",
    "we assume that the state to be teleported is a coherent state , @xmath167 .",
    "standard continuous - variable teleportation @xcite consists of three steps : ( 1 ) alice combines one mode of the entangled state , say the @xmath14-mode , with the input mode in state @xmath168 at a @xmath169 beam splitter ; then she measures the quadratures variables @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "( 2 ) when she obtains the classical measurement results for @xmath172 and @xmath173 , she then communicates them to bob via a classical communication channel .",

    "unit fidelity requires perfect entanglement .",
    "mathematically , the joint quadrature measurement on the input mode @xmath168 and mode @xmath14 is equivalent to a heterodyne measurement ( acting on mode @xmath176 , expressible as @xcite @xmath177 where here @xmath8 denotes the transposition operation . for the normalized entangled state @xmath178 ,",

    "@xcite , we find that @xmath187 moreover , by noticing that the partially transposed @xmath188 is block diagonal , we can simplify the fidelity ( [ fide ] ) as follows , @xmath189}{\\mathrm{tr}(\\rho_{_{ab}}^{\\gamma_a})}=\\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\mathrm{tr } [ \\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{k } } \\mathbf{o}_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\gamma } ( \\mathrm{k})]}{\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\mathrm{tr } [ \\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{k}}]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath190 is the @xmath191 sub - block matrix @xmath192 .",
    "thus , using @xmath37 as defined above , the teleportation fidelity can be easily evaluated .",
    "for example , for the state before entanglement distillation , the matrix @xmath37 is given by eq .",
    "( [ ckdef ] ) , and the fidelity becomes @xmath193    similarly , from the definitions in eq .",
    "( [ ckdefonon ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ckdefll ] ) , the teleportation fidelity for the ps - distilled states can be obtained , respectively .",
    "for example , in comparison with the logarithmic negativities calculated in sec .",
    "[ pnrsec ] , we present a numerical evaluation of the teleportation fidelity for pure pnr - distilled entangled states in fig .",
    "[ telefidelitypnr ] . for @xmath194 , the teleportation fidelity",
    "is obviously improved in the low - squeezing regime ( @xmath195 ) , in a similar way to what we obtained for the logarithmic - negativity measured entanglement in fig .",
    "[ resll ] . however , note that the logarithmic negativity is known to have an operational meaning ( quantified by the quality of quantum correlations used in quantum teleportation ) only for symmetric gaussian states .",
    "indeed , our amplitude - damped tmsss do belong to the class of symmetric gaussian states .",
    "however , for the photon - subtracted , non - gaussian states after distillation , the correspondence between logarithmic negativity and coherent - state teleportation fidelity is not obvious ; even though it is possible to relate the second - moment correlations of photon - subtracted states with their logarithmic negativities @xcite .     using a pure - pnr - distilled amplitude - damped tmss .",
    "the parameters are @xmath155 as in fig .",
    "[ resll].,title=\"fig:\",width=8 ] +",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a photon - subtraction - based entanglement distillation scheme on a single copy of a gaussian mixed state in form of an amplitude - damped two - mode squeezed state ( tmss ) using beamsplitters and various photon detection strategies .",
    "the photon measurements included on - off and photon number resolving detectors , as well as mixed photon number resolving detections where the on - off threshold can be varied compared to the conventional on - off measurement with zero or non - zero photons detected . exploiting the symmetry and centrosymmetry properties of the partially transposed density matrix written in the fock basis , we were able to derive explicit formulas for the entanglement of the non - gaussian mixed states after distillation in terms of the logarithmic negativity .",
    "we showed that in order to improve the entanglement after the imperfect channel transmission of the tmss subject to photon losses , a constraint represented by a lower bound for the beamsplitters ( used for photon subtraction ) must be satisfied .",
    "our results extend earlier work on continuous - variable distillation from pure entangled states to the more general case of mixed entangled states , as one usually encounters in most realistic situations such as experimental demonstrations @xcite and optical - fiber - based communications .",
    "most importantly , even for channel attenuations as large as 3db , the photon - subtraction - based entanglement distillation scheme still works fairly well , provided the input squeezing is chosen sufficiently small .",
    "the applicability of our protocol to actual long - distance quantum communication , for instance , by building up a quantum repeater @xcite , depends on various parameters .",
    "first of all , note that the success probabilities in the present scheme are rather low ; i.e. , as low as or even lower than those of the known discrete - variable repeater proposals based upon single - photon detections .",
    "moreover , our results show that for any ( sufficiently small ) initial squeezing @xmath100 for which the distilled entanglement exceeds the input entanglement , there is always a different , effective squeezing value @xmath196 for which the same or even higher entanglement can be distributed through the lossy channels without subsequent distillations .",
    "this suggests that our distillation still mainly functions as an entanglement concentration , similar to what can be obtained for photon - subtraction - based distillation of pure states .",
    "it is important to see that distillation still works for mixed states , however , in a potential application , it may still be better to use large squeezing from the beginning without distillation . in this case , the question arises how large this input squeezing must be to beat the distillation - based protocol .    more specifically , using our formulas",
    ", one can find that the logarithmic negativities before and after distillation are related by @xmath197 , for all initial squeezings @xmath198 , all channel transmissions @xmath7 , and all photon - subtraction transmittances @xmath199 .",
    "nonetheless , for example , with 3db losses in the channel ( corresponding to an elementary distance in a quantum repeater of almost one attenuation length ) , the same entanglement as for transmitting an almost 10db - squeezed tmss without distillation can be obtained through photon - subtraction - based distillation of a roughly 6db - squeezed tmss after transmission",
    ". however , the former approach would be deterministic , whereas the latter is highly probabilistic , leading to further complications in a full quantum repeater such as the need for sufficient quantum memories . further extensions of our scheme , including more general measurements and local operations on a single gaussian mixed state or multi - copy distillations may prove superior to the protocol presented here .",
