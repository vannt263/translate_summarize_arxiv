    "bell s original inequality reveals the conflict of quantum mechanics and local hidden variable ( lhv ) theory @xcite .",

    "subsequently , werner and ukowski ( wwb ) presented explicit description of @xmath0-qubit bell - correlation inequalities for two dichotomic observables per site @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that all these results only concern with the `` full '' correlation function , that is , the expectation value of the product of all @xmath0 local observables .",
    "we call this class of bell - type inequalities as _ homogeneous _ inequalities .    besides full correlations",
    ", one can take into account partial correlations , which involve the product of not @xmath0 but @xmath1 observables .",
    "it is meaningful to construct such _ non - homogeneous _ bell - type inequalities that incorporate partial correlations as well as full correlations .",
    "the main reason is as follows .",
    "gisin proved that the bipartite pure entangled states violate chsh inequality @xcite .",
    "the problem whether gisin theorem can be generalized for an arbitrary n - partite pure entangled states remains open .",
    "in the three - qubit case there are generalized ghz states that do not violate the mabk inequalities @xcite .",
    "more generally it has been shown that these states do not violate any bell - type inequality for n - partite correlation functions ( that is , homogeneous inequality ) for experiments involving two dichotomic observables per site @xcite .",
    "subsequently some bell - type inequalities , which bear the non - homogeneous form , were presented and can be violated by generalized ghz states @xcite .",
    "besides , non - homogeneous inequalities have appeared in the discussion of the non - locality of cluster states @xcite",
    ". however one can hardly make clear how and why these inequalities come out .",
    "in other words , there is no systematic formulation of such inequalities .    motivated by this issue , we present in this paper a feasible method to construct non - homogeneous bell - type inequalities .",
    "the key point is so simple that we can describe it very briefly in one sentence , that is , non - homogeneous inequalities are derived by subtracting some projector - like terms from the homogeneous ones .",
    "we will first present the construction of two - qubit non - homogeneous inequalities .",
    "the newly obtained inequalities are weaker than chsh inequality in that the quantum mechanical violation of the former is smaller than that of the latter .",
    "nevertheless , they pave the way for the considering more general cases .",
    "consequently we attain so many three - qubit non - homogeneous inequalities and some meaningful results . in ref .",
    "@xcite , pitowsky and svozil have presented several optimal three - qubit bell - type inequalities in the sense that they represent the best possible upper bounds for the conceivable classical probabilities .",
    "these inequalities are filtrated from tens of thousands of inequalities describing the facets of classical correlation polytope .",
    "though these inequalities appear very intricate , they can be constructed systematically in our framework .",
    "additionally the two bell - type inequalities , which were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to disclose the non - locality of generalized three - qubit ghz states , are included in our results .    when these inequalities are utilized to display the non - locality experimentally",
    ", one has to consider the effect of non - ideal detector . using the software mathematica and matlab",
    ", we numerically analyze the detection efficiency limit of the above - mentioned three - qubit bell - type inequalities .",
    "three detectors may have the same efficiency or not @xcite .",
    "with respect to these two different cases , we attain the thresholds of detection efficiency .",
    "some inequalities have the advantage that the efficiency of one detector can be arbitrarily low if that of the other two detectors satisfy certain conditions .",
    "we start by briefly recalling lhv model and bell - type inequalities .",
    "bell - type inequalities always refer to correlations between two or more sites . in the two - qubit case ,",
    "each of two space - separated observers , a and b , gets a qubit and measures two @xmath2-valued local observables , denoted @xmath3 , @xmath4 for observer a , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 for observer b. the outcomes of measurement are labeled by @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "a typical joint probability can be expressed as @xmath10 , where after the vertical bar we write the observables chosen at two sites , and before the bar the particular outcomes .    in the formalism of",
    "local hidden variable ( lhv ) theory , there exists a hidden variable @xmath11 which takes values in space @xmath12 . with the presence of @xmath11 , the probability of measuring @xmath13 and obtaining the outcome @xmath14",
    "is represented by @xmath15 .",
    "similarly for @xmath16 . given @xmath11 , one can calculate the mean value of @xmath17 from the probability @xmath15 , @xmath18 similarly for @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore lhv theory requires that with the presence of @xmath11 the joint probability @xmath20 is factorisable , that is , @xmath21 where @xmath15 is independent of observable @xmath22 and its outcome @xmath23 , and @xmath16 independent of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "given the probability measure @xmath24 on @xmath12 , using , one can compute the joint probability @xmath25 consequently the expectation value of joint measurement is @xmath26    in the context of hidden variable model , correlation function is defined as @xmath27 one can see that @xmath28 , and the inequality is saturated only if @xmath29 and @xmath30 take the extremal values of @xmath2 .",
    "chsh inequality is attained by averaging over hidden variable @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath31    in the following discussion , it is convenient to adopt @xmath32 to represent chsh inequality , that is , @xmath33 where we replace @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 for simplicity .",
    "we also make the following definitions . @xmath36",
    "each @xmath37 is called ( homogeneous ) chsh polynomial and has the same bound of @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "now we start to construct non - homogeneous polynomial , denoted @xmath41 .",
    "we require that @xmath41 satisfies two conditions :    * @xmath42 .",
    "that means in the lhv upper bound of @xmath41 is @xmath38 .",
    "* in the case of quantum mechanics , @xmath41 is replaced with the operator form @xmath43 , and the expectation value given by @xmath44 can be larger than 2 .    in other words , @xmath42 is a bell - type inequality .",
    "the key point of the method presented here is so transparent that at first sight it seems to be trivial : since every chsh polynomial satisfies @xmath45 , it is evident that @xmath37 minus some non - negative terms must be equal to or less than @xmath38 .",
    "these non - negative terms are chosen to be @xmath46 a typical non - homogeneous polynomial is then given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is any non - negative number .",
    "considering condition ( i ) , we note that @xmath42 and @xmath41 reaches the maximal value of @xmath38 at specific extremal values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for example , when @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath41 equals @xmath38 .",
    "so satisfies condition ( i ) .",
    "we now show that condition ( ii ) can also be fulfilled . in quantum - mechanical case ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 in are replaced with spin observables , namely , @xmath53 , @xmath54 . correspondingly , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 is @xmath57 identity matrix",
    ".    then the quantum mechanical form of is @xmath58 any two - qubit entangled pure state can be expressed as the form of schmidt decomposition ( see , for example , @xcite ) , @xmath59 the expectation value of @xmath43 is given by @xmath60 when @xmath61 , @xmath62 acquires the maximal value @xmath63^{1/2}-\\frac{r}{2}\\sin^{2}\\xi,\\ ] ] which is obviously larger than @xmath38 . therefore represents a series of non - homogeneous inequalities and",

    "some remarks are needed here . in the above calculation ,",
    "we do not intend to find the maximal violation of lhv bound .",
    "the choices of observable , given by , and , do not cover all possible local measurements .",
    "they are so selected as to simplify the calculation .",
    "therefore @xmath95 and @xmath96 do not represent the maximal violation of lhv bound . in the same way , the condition of @xmath93 is just required in the case considered . in the following subsection",
    ", we discuss the maximal violation of inequalities @xmath42 and @xmath97 .",
    "two typical forms of non - homogeneous inequality have been presented in and .",
    "we now analyze the violation of them in quantum mechanics .",

    "similar analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath112 is also between @xmath38 and @xmath104 , and asymptotically equals @xmath113 when @xmath114 .    in a word ,",
    "the inequalities @xmath115 and @xmath116 can be violated by quantum mechanics for arbitrary non - negative numbers of @xmath117 .",
    "the maximal violation corresponds to the case of @xmath118 . with @xmath48 , @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath66 sufficiently large , the violation is close to a constant .",
