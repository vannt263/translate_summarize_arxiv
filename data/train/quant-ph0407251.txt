    "the bell basis states , the two - qubit state - vectors introduced by bohm [ 1 ] , have proven to be the most fruitful objects of study in the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information science , due to their extreme entanglement properties [ 2 ] . the non - factorizability that defines entanglement arises in these states from their symmetry or antisymmetry under the binary exchange of their qubit subsystems , each half the size of the composite system . here",
    ", we use these properties to define a new , broader class of sets of quantum states , which we call `` bell gems , '' generalizing the bell basis to larger qubit numbers .",
    "we recursively define the members of this class and exhibit maps through which they can be formally constructed .",
    "we show that the elements of these sets form orthonormal bases for the multiple - qubit hilbert spaces in which they reside and possess maximal entanglement according to the @xmath0-tangle measure .",
    "finally , we identify bell gems and elements that have proven useful in quantum information processing applications and provide quantum circuits for their creation from computational basis elements .    the bell basis for the two - qubit quantum state space @xmath1 is the set consisting of the following two - qubit state vectors , the bell states : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are orthogonal and normalized quantum state vectors of the same dimensionality ( the two orthogonal single - qubit states @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the quantum computational basis ) .",
    "the forms , given in expressions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , of the bell states guarantee their non - factorizability and maximal entanglement as measured by the concurrence or equivalently by its square , the tangle @xmath7 [ 3 ] .    here , we construct bases generalizing the bell basis for higher multiparticle systems by retaining these forms as qubit number is scaled up .",
    "the binary subsystem exchange symmetry inherent in the forms given by expressions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is now incorporated in the definition of the sets of states generalizing the bell basis , which are thereby retained under changes of scale .",
    "the bell gems are recursively defined , as follows .    *",
    "definition : * a _ bell gem _",
    ", @xmath8 , is a set of mutually orthogonal normalized quantum state vectors , lying in the @xmath9-dimensional hilbert space @xmath10 , possessing the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 are elements of a bell gem @xmath13 of dimensionality @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the simplest bell gem being the bell basis , @xmath16 , for @xmath17 : @xmath18 is an orthonormal basis for the @xmath19-dimensional hilbert space of quantum state vectors , @xmath20 , that is , for the hilbert space of @xmath21 qubits .",
    "_ a bell gem is , by the above definition , a set of normalized linearly independent quantum state vectors of equal qubit number . to prove this set is an orthonormal basis ,",
    "it therefore remains only show that @xmath22 spans the hilbert space of @xmath21 qubits .",
    "that is , we now need only show that it consists of @xmath19 elements",
    ". this can be done by counting the number of elements of @xmath22 of each of the two available forms , given by expressions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "there are @xmath23 such linearly independent vectors of the form ( 5 ) since each product @xmath24 of two identical copies of any one of the @xmath23 state vectors @xmath25 from which they are constructed can appear only once in expression ( 5 ) ( recalling that , by definition , they are mutually orthogonal ) .",
    "there are , similarly , @xmath26 vectors of the form of expression ( 6 ) , since there are @xmath23 choices in @xmath27 available for @xmath3 and @xmath28 choices for @xmath4 remaining after the choice of @xmath3 has been made , due to the constraint that @xmath29 . summing the total number of state vectors of the two forms ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , the two forms themselves being orthogonal to one another by construction",
    ", we have @xmath30 linearly independent vectors .",
    "thus , we see that the @xmath21-qubit state space @xmath31 is spanned by the bell gem @xmath32 .",
    "the bell gem @xmath22 is , therefore , an orthonormal basis for the space of @xmath21 qubits .",
    "@xmath33    one can view the bell gems larger than the simplest bell gem ( @xmath34 ) as arising through the action of simple maps on products of elements of the predecessor gem .",
    "assume we are given two subsystems , a and b , each described by elements of a bell gem @xmath27 . to construct elements of a bell gem @xmath22 of the form ( 5 ) from these",
    ", one can use the two following sorts of maps : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are distinct elements of @xmath27 . to construct elements of a bell gem @xmath22 of the form ( 6 ) from these",
    ", one can similarly use the maps @xmath38 such as have been considered in the study of quantum entanglers .",
    "the second simplest gem , @xmath39 , which unambiguously exhibits the multiplicities described above , is shown explicitly in section iii below .    like their simplest examplar , the bell states",
    ", the elements of all bell gems are maximally entangled according to the @xmath40-tangle measure , @xmath41 where @xmath42 [ 4,5 ] .",
    "this is shown in the following theorem .",
    "* theorem 2 : * the elements of @xmath22 have maximal @xmath21-tangle .",
    "_ proof_. the effect of @xmath43 on each element of the simplest bell gem , @xmath44 , is simply to produce a negative sign in the case it is one of the even parity states , @xmath45 , and to have no effect in the case it is one of the odd parity states , @xmath46 .",
    "for every successor gem , in the case of elements of the form ( 5 ) , there are identical signs produced by the transformation @xmath47 on the ( predecessor bell gem element ) factors of each of the two addends both of which are , therefore , unchanged . in the case of the form ( 6 ) , the sign of the addends after the transformation is the same , leaving the element itself unchanged up to a sign .",
    "thus @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ all elements of @xmath22 have maximal @xmath21-tangle .",
    "the simplest bell gem is the bell basis , the importance of which for quantum information science ( _ e.g. _ in entangled photon quantum cryptography [ 6,7 ] ) and the foundations of quantum mechanics ( _ e.g. _  [ 1 ] ) is well known . here , as a further example",
    ", the next simplest bell gem , @xmath39 for @xmath49 qubits is written explicitly and quantum circuits for creating them are given . the significance of its elements for quantum information processing is mentioned and a specific application in quantum communication is pointed out .    the 16 elements @xmath50 of the @xmath51-qubit bell gem @xmath52 for @xmath53 can be written    @xmath54    it is known that simple quantum logic circuits involving only two quantum logic gates , the c - not and hadamard gates , allow one to obtain the bell states - forming the archetypical bell gem - from two unentangled qubits ( see , _",
    "e.g _ [ 8 ] ) .",
    "simple quantum logic circuits will now be exhibited that similarly create the above bell gem elements from four unentangled qubits - that is , from elements of the computational basis .",
    "the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 are obtained using the circuit shown in figure 1 with input qubits @xmath57 , where @xmath58 are specifically @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the states @xmath61 and @xmath62 are obtained using the circuit shown in figure 2 with input qubits latexmath:[$|x_1\\rangle ,    @xmath58 are @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "finally , the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 are obtained using the circuit shown in figure 3 with input qubits @xmath68 and @xmath65 .",
    "while the first of these circuits is somewhat similar to that used to produce the bell basis from the computational basis - like the bell circuit , it contains only one hadamard gate and c - not gates - the other two appear significantly different from it .",
    "the elements of the form given in expression ( 5 ) , namely the first four of the above elements , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , of the forms ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , are also the codes states of the ( extended ) quantum erasure channel [ 9 ] .",
    "latexmath:[$|{\\mathbf e}_2\\rangle ,    codes states comprising a one - error correcting detected - jump quantum code and are basis states for a decoherence - free subspace in which universal @xmath51-qubit quantum computing can be carried out [ 10 ] . as a specific application of some of these bell gem elements , note that the states @xmath72 , which is highly beneficial since photon loss is a primary factor in the performance of simple optical quantum memories .",
    "specifically , there exists an error correction protocol based on these states that provides for a more efficient quantum memory based on optical fiber delay - line loops [ 12 ] . successfully carrying out this error correction process within an optical fiber loop ( see [ 11 ] to view this circuit and [ 12 ] for a description of an optical fiber loop memory ) allows quantum errors to be continually corrected on captured flying data qubits , improving the performance of quantum communication lines .",
    "we introduced a class of self - similar sets of quantum states , which we call the `` bell gems , '' and provided a recursive definition of these sets .",
    "every bell gem of finite dimensionality was shown to be an orthonormal basis for the hilbert space in which it naturally resides .",
    "furthermore , the elements of all bell gems of @xmath21 qubits were shown to have maximal @xmath21-tangle .",
    "a nontrivial bell gem was exhibited and the utility of its elements for quantum information processing was pointed out .",
    "quantum circuits for the creation of its elements were provided and a specific application of some of these for quantum communication was pointed out . given this utility",
    ", it seems likely that the bell gems of yet greater complexity will be similarly useful for quantum information applications , such as quantum coding and quantum error correction subspaces , given the importance of entanglement and multipartite symmetry in such applications .",
