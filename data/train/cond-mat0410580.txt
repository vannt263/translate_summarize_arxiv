    "a theoretical description of the intrinsic thermal fluctuations induced by the coupling of a given dynamical system with a heat bath can be obtained by adding a noise term to the equations of motion . from this point of view that originates from langevin s treatment of brownian motion ,",
    "the effect of the heat bath is modeled as a random force that transforms a deterministic motion into a stochastic dynamics in phase space .",
    "the physics of the system is then described by a probability distribution function ( p.d.f . ) and the information about the observables is of statistical nature .",
    "when the additive noise is white ( _ i.e. _ , the correlation time of the noise is smaller than any intrinsic time scale of the system ) and its amplitude satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation relation , the stationary p.d.f . is identical to the canonical boltzmann - gibbs distribution @xcite .",
    "a paradigm of a stochastic dynamical system for a quantitative study of the interplay between randomness and nonlinearity is provided by a particle trapped in a nonlinear confining potential and subject to a random noise @xcite .",
    "we showed in @xcite that in the limit of a vanishingly small damping rate , such a particle exhibits anomalous diffusion with exponents that depend on the form of the confining potential at infinity . for a non - zero damping rate , this anomalous diffusion occurs as intermediate time asymptotics : the particle diffuses in phase space and absorbs energy from the noise until the dissipative time scale is reached and the physical observables become stationary .",
    "for an additive gaussian white noise , it was shown explicitly @xcite that , for times larger than the inverse damping rate , the intermediate time p.d.f . matches the canonical distribution . for colored noise",
    ", we observed from numerical simulations that the anomalous growth exponents are different from those calculated for white noise .",
    "this behavior strongly suggests that the long time asymptotics in the case of colored noise is not identical to the canonical boltzmann - gibbs distribution .",
    "the physical reason for this change of behavior is the following : the intrinsic period of a nonlinear oscillator is a decreasing function of its energy and when the amplitude of the oscillations grows the period eventually becomes shorter than the correlation time of the noise . in that case ,",
    "destructive interference between the fast variable and the noise suppresses the energy transfer from the noise to the system and the diffusion slows down . in this regime ,",
    "the correlation time of the noise ceases to be the shortest time scale in the system and the noise can not be treated perturbatively as white .",
    "therefore , usual perturbative calculations based on small correlation time expansions @xcite can not predict the correct colored noise scalings ( this was shown explicitely for the pendulum with multiplicative noise in @xcite ) . besides , the averaging procedure used for the white noise fails for colored noise and in @xcite we could only infer the colored noise exponents using qualitative scaling arguments .",
    "our aim , in this work , is to perform an analytical study of nonlinear oscillator subject to an additive ornstein - uhlenbeck noise and to derive quantitative results for its long time behavior .",
    "we need to generalize the averaging method used for white noise in @xcite so that it can be applied to a regime where the correlation time of the noise is not the shortest time scale in the system .",
    "we define , in a recursive manner , new coordinates on phase space that embody , order by order , correlations between the noise and the fast angular variable and then average out the fast variable .",
    "this technique allows us to obtain an analytical expression for the long time asymptotic behavior of the p.d.f . of the system , to derive the anomalous scaling exponents and to calculate generalized diffusion constants .",
    "in particular , it is shown explicitly that the long time p.d.f .",
    "of a nonlinear oscillator subject to additive colored noise is not the canonical boltzmann - gibbs distribution .",
    "our results are systematically compared with numerical simulations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : review ] , we review results derived in @xcite and which are required for the present work . in section [ sec : averaging ] we first explain why the straightforward averaging technique fails for colored noise , provide a heuristic calculation that explains the idea underlying the correct averaging scheme and develop it analytically .",
