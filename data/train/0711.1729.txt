    "statistical physics indicates that the state for a stationary radiation field with particles of no rest mass such as photons is described by a polytropic relation with an index @xmath4 .",
    "it is proven that @xmath4 is also a very good approximation for relativistically hot particles with negligible rest mass .",
    "moreover for the stellar structure , chandrasekhar ( 1939 ) noted that for an infinitesimal uniform expansion or contraction of a gas sphere , it involves precisely a polytropic process of an index @xmath4 . for a static equilibrium configuration and a presumed @xmath13 with a globally constant @xmath9 , the virial theorem indicates that @xmath14 situations are unstable and @xmath4 corresponds to a transition from unstable to stable configurations as @xmath8 increases .",
    "when @xmath4 for a static equilibrium configuration , the equilibrium condition is referred to as the lane - emden equation with the total enclosed mass @xmath15 being independent of the system radius but dependent upon the value of @xmath9 .    on the other hand ,",
    "based on the conventional polytropic equation of state @xmath13 , where @xmath9 is a global constant and @xmath8 varies from @xmath16 for an isothermal case to @xmath17 for an adiabatic process of monatomic gas , astrophysicists explored properties of hydrodynamic behaviours in diverse contexts , such as star formation , core formation in molecular clouds and supernova explosions etc . for catching the basic physics and theoretical simplicity ,",
    "most works on gravitational stellar core collapses or stellar explosions were usually carried out under the spherical symmetry . hunter ( 1962 ) considered the stability of an equilibrium system and the collapse process based on a polytropic hydrodynamics .",
    "he demonstrated how a dynamical instability during the collapse leads to a breakup of the spherically symmetric radial inflow of gas .",
    "shu ( 1977 ) constructed the isothermal expansion - wave collapse solution ( ewcs ) with a weak discontinuity ; and this self - similar hydrodynamic model has been further developed in the past three decades , from the isothermal case ( e.g. , shu 1977 ; lou & shen 2004 ) to the polytropic case ( e.g. , suto & silk 1988 ; yahil 1983 ; lou & wang 2006 ) , as well as to the logotropic case ( e.g. , mclaughlin & pudritz 1997 ) .",
    "observationally , spectral lines of cs , h@xmath18co and other molecules in star forming regions show that the single peak of each molecular line splits into double peaks with the blue peak brighter than the red peak , which has been regarded as a supporting evidence to the shu model ( e.g. zhou 1992 ; walker , narayanan & boss 1994 ; myers et al .",
    "it is generally expected that shock waves are also involved in self - similar collapse or expansion profiles ( e.g. , tsai & hsu 1995 ; shu et al .",
    "2002 ; bian & lou 2005 ) .",
    "note that all above studies were carried out on either the isothermal case or the @xmath19 polytropic case . in one case ,",
    "the polytropic case of @xmath4 is treated as a limiting case ( yahil 1983 ) . in contrast , goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) directly considered homologous core collapse for a conventional polytropic gas with @xmath4 by making use of the time reversal invariance .",
    "they concluded that when the pressure decreases by a fraction of no more than about @xmath20 from a static polytrope in equilibrium , a homologous core collapse would occur in the stellar interior . on the other hand , numerical simulation of bethe et al .",
    "( 1979 ) indicated a fractional reduction of pressure by @xmath21 in order to initiate a core collapse for a supernova explosion .",
    "goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) tried to reduce this difference by introducing an inner core of a progenitor star ; yahil ( 1983 ) performed his polytropic analysis and treated their result as a limit of @xmath22 .",
    "meanwhile , specific entropy conservation along streamlines does not necessarily mean a constant specific entropy everywhere at all times . a more general distribution would be a variable specific entropy in time and radius ( e.g. cheng 1977 , 1978 ) .",
    "fatuzzo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) introduced a self - similar transformation to formulate a more general problem , which involves a scaling index @xmath10 and another index @xmath23 .",
    "the more general equation of state appears to be @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 case corresponds to the conventional polytropic gas .",
    "in fact , according to this more general equation of state , the conservation of mass implies the conservation of specific entropy along streamlines .",
    "nevertheless , fatuzzo et al . (",
    "2004 ) mainly focused on the isothermal cases with nonzero inward flow speeds far away in molecular clouds ( shen & lou 2004 ) .",
    "our consideration is on a more general polytropic gas with @xmath4 with the specific entropy conserved along streamlines . by a self - similar transformation",
    ", we can approach the resulting nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) systematically .",
    "solution properties depend on the scaling index @xmath10 . given a distribution of variable specific entropy with time and radius ,",
    "the result of goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) can be substantially extended . meanwhile , many counterparts of previously known solutions in the isothermal and conventional polytropic cases can also be derived . in particular ,",
    "several new asymptotic solutions unique to @xmath4 are also obtained .",
    "an important and interesting result of our analysis is that under the joint action of thermal pressure force and self - gravity , a central spherical void can form and evolve in a self - similar manner ; this is to be compared with the central spherical void solution of fillmore & goldreich ( 1984b ) which considered a collection of collisionless particles under self - gravity in the einstein - de sitter expanding universe .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "nonlinear adiabatic hydrodynamic equations in spherical symmetry and self - similar transformation are described in section 2 for a polytropic gas with a polytropic index @xmath4 .",
    "the extensions of the classical analysis of goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) are presented in section 3 and further discussed for a homologous stellar core collapse in section 6.1 .",
    "we mainly focus on cases of @xmath26 for various solution properties such as the requirement on the scaling index @xmath10 , the property of scaling invariance , global analytic solutions , the sonic singular surface , the straight sonic critical lines , eigensolutions across the sonic critical line , various asymptotic solutions , and shock jump conditions in sections 4 .",
    "we analyze various semi - complete numerical solutions with or without shocks and corresponding results in section 5 . finally , we conclude and discuss our main results in section 6 .",
    "three appendices a , b and c are included at the end for technical details of derivations and analyses .",
    "as a theoretical model formulation , dynamical processes outlined in introduction are governed by the basic nonlinear hydrodynamic equations under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "we naturally adopt the spherical polar coordinates @xmath27 in the analysis .",
    "the mass conservation is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the enclosed mass within radius @xmath12 at time @xmath11 , the mass density @xmath30 is a function of @xmath12 and @xmath11 and @xmath31 is the radial flow velocity .",
    "the above two relations in equation ( [ eq01 ] ) are equivalent to the mass continuity equation @xmath32 the gas motion is governed by the radial momentum equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the thermal gas pressure and @xmath35 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the poisson equation relating the mass density @xmath7 and the gravitational potential @xmath36 is automatically satisfied with @xmath37 . finally , the conservation of specific entropy @xmath38 along streamlines is simply @xmath39 where @xmath8 is the polytropic index .",

    ", equations @xmath51 take the form of @xmath52 ( fatuzzo et al .",
    "2004 ; wang & lou 2007 ) . before proceeding ,",
    "we note that these equations are invariant under the following time reversal transformation , namely @xmath53 therefore any solution can also depict its inverse process as long as this process is reversible ( e.g. , not involving shocks ) .",
    "for example , one solution describing a collapse can be also utilized to describe an expansion process .",
    "more importantly , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) implies a division of all cases into three classes by whether or not scaling parameter @xmath10 is greater than , equal to or less than @xmath54 ; in general , @xmath10 is required to be negative .",
    "this requirement of a negative @xmath10 is not obvious by equations ( [ eq07])@xmath55([eq5 ] ) . by the asymptotic solutions ( [ static ] ) and ( [ asym1 ] ) at large @xmath46 derived later , it is necessary to require @xmath56 for convergent solutions at large @xmath46 .",
    "we first analyze the case of @xmath57 precisely which includes the classical analysis of goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) .",
    "their model was applied to a stellar core collapse under self - gravity prior to the core bouncing in the context of supernova explosions . by equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) ,",
    "we simply have @xmath58 the case of @xmath59 everywhere at all time would be a trivial solution ; for nontrivial solution , the radial flow velocity is thus given by @xmath60 and then equation ( [ eq4 ] ) requires @xmath61 leading to @xmath4 precisely . here",
    "@xmath49 represents an expansion solution , or a core collapse solution with the time reversal invariance transformation",
    ". meanwhile , equation ( [ eq5 ] ) becomes automatically satisfied under this transformation , giving no further information or constraint .",
    "taking the derivative of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) with respect to @xmath46 , we derive @xmath62 now these equations are not complete yet and a more general description of specific entropy distribution as a function of @xmath46 is allowed . in other words , we already get @xmath63 but do not know the proportional coefficient as a function of @xmath64 which is associated with the enclosed mass @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , this point can also been seen by directly comparing @xmath6 and @xmath7 in self - similar transformation ( [ eq07 ] ) .",
    "physically , @xmath66 is proportional to the specific entropy @xmath38 in a polytropic gas .",
    "once we know the distribution of specific entropy as a function of @xmath46 , the self - similar polytropic flow is then determined .",
    "the first cut is to take a constant specific entropy everywhere at all times , i.e. , @xmath67 with @xmath9 being a global constant .",
    "in fact , this is exactly what goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) did .",
    "for @xmath68 in self - similar transformation ( [ eq07 ] ) , we immediately obtain @xmath69 and a second - order ode for @xmath70 from equation ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "we may write @xmath71 for the convenience of comparison and the second - order nonlinear ode for @xmath72 with a central condition is then @xmath73 where @xmath74 is related to the central mass density and is an adjustable parameter up to @xmath75 . in numerical integrations , we may encounter @xmath76 at a finite @xmath77 under certain conditions . if this is the case , an outer travelling boundary of the flow system exists .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to solve equation ( [ eq17 ] ) numerically by the standard runge - kutta scheme ( e.g. , press et al .",

    ", the mass density does not vanish at a finite @xmath77 and does not approach zero for large @xmath46 either . by comparing our adjustable parameter @xmath79 with parameter @xmath86 of goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) , we readily establish the following simple conversion relation @xmath87 parameter @xmath86 has a maximum value as noted by goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) ; their maximum value @xmath88 corresponds to our @xmath75 well .",

    "when @xmath79 is lower than this minimum value @xmath75 , there is no self - similar solution with vanishing density at a finite @xmath90 .",
    "physically , @xmath75 corresponds to the minimum central density for a homologous or self - similar core collapse to be possible .",
    "in addition to the preceding analysis , our polytropic model analysis here does not necessarily require a constant specific entropy everywhere ( in time and space ) and therefore substantially generalizes the work of goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) .",
    "in fact , we can allow for a fairly arbitrary distribution of specific entropy and therefore accommodate a broad class of solutions for the density profile .",
    "a proper distribution of specific entropy can be described by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a sensible but otherwise arbitrary function .",
    "in fact , the case studied by goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) simply corresponds to @xmath93 . for a more general @xmath92",

    "the value of @xmath105 , similar to @xmath106 in gw , increases by a factor of 1.045 when @xmath79 increases from @xmath75 to a sufficiently large value , which is also equal to that of gw .    as examples of illustration",
    ", we shall prescribe specific functional forms of @xmath92 and analyze corresponding solutions of @xmath72 presently in section 6.3 .",
    "in this section , we mainly focus on cases with @xmath107 . in these cases",
    ", it is still possible for @xmath4 which was not considered by goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) and yahil ( 1983 ) .",
    "we turn to reduced nonlinear odes ( [ eq1])@xmath55([eq5 ] ) to start our discussion .",
    "first , a combination of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) immediately gives the reduced mass as @xmath108 by equation ( [ meq ] ) , no confined solution for @xmath47 by a finite value of @xmath77 exists because @xmath59 at a finite @xmath46 directly leads to @xmath109 , i.e. , no enclosed mass at all within this @xmath46 where the mass density vanishes . as a result",
    ", no solutions can be confined by a finite @xmath77 . in these cases ,",
    "the @xmath46 range of both analytical and numerical solutions is infinite and some sensible cutoffs need to be introduced for astrophysical applications .",
    "moreover , the enclosed mass should be always positive such that @xmath110 . for @xmath111",
    ", we must require @xmath112 , while for @xmath113 , we should have @xmath114 .",
    "this is a strict constraint of self - similar transformation such that no decreasing solutions of @xmath49 exist for @xmath113 . in general",
    ", @xmath10 should be always less than @xmath115 because of the requirement of a real physical system .",
    "dividing equation ( [ eq4 ] ) by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath116 where another index parameter @xmath23 is defined by @xmath117 and @xmath118 is a constant of integration .",
    "this carries an apparent physical meaning .",
    "it is mentioned earlier that if the specific entropy is a function of the enclosed mass , the conservation of specific entropy along streamlines is automatically satisfied .",
    "the similarity transformation then gives a more specific constraint on the form of this function , which is proportional to @xmath119 .",
    "substituting the dimensionless quantities for dimensional ones , we explicitly obtain @xmath120 here we have two constant coefficients : @xmath45 is introduced in the transformation and @xmath118 is a constant of integration . for @xmath121 and thus @xmath122 , we can adjust the value of @xmath118 and @xmath45 such that @xmath123 ( see lou & wang 2007 for more details ) . in this paper , however , we focus on the case of @xmath4 and thus @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath45 no longer plays an important role because the exponent index vanishes in expression ( [ state ] ) and thus disappears .",
    "in contrast , @xmath118 becomes vital in our case under consideration .",
    "on one hand , the local specific entropy is @xmath124 the value of @xmath118 is related to the specific entropy . on the other hand , the local polytropic sound speed is @xmath125 which is also related to the value of @xmath118 .",
    "the value of @xmath118 will affect our equations and thus solutions in a nontrivial manner .",
    "substituting equations ( [ fos ] ) and ( [ meq ] ) into equations ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , we readily obtain two coupled nonlinear odes @xmath126 explicit expressions of these two equations for @xmath127 and @xmath128 are contained in appendix [ a1 ] .",
    "our subsequent analysis is based on these two coupled nonlinear odes ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) . before a further discussion , one notes that besides the time reversal invariance , odes ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) are also invariant under the following scaling transformation , namely @xmath129 where @xmath130 is an arbitrary positive constant .",
    "this scale invariance only exists when @xmath4 or @xmath26 and brings us considerable convenience in theoretical analysis .",
    "previously , two kinds of analytic solutions were found , namely , the static singular polytropic sphere ( sps ) solution and the einstein - de sitter expansion solution in the newtonian regime ( e.g. , wang & lou 2007 ) .",
    "we confirm that for the current special case of @xmath4 , these two solutions still exist with certain modifications and constraints .",
    "for the former , we note that no static sps solution exists for @xmath131 because of inequality @xmath132 . for @xmath111",
    ", we can set @xmath133 in the two odes and obtain @xmath134 where @xmath135 is an arbitrary positive coefficient .",
    "unlike previous polytropic models with @xmath121 , parameter @xmath118 here is specifically determined by a chosen @xmath111 in the model .",
    "it implies that the system requires a special relationship between the thermal gas pressure and the combination of @xmath136 to keep the system in a radial force balance .",
    "the so - called einstein - de sitter solution in the newtonian approximation with a constant mass density also exists here for @xmath4 . by taking a constant density , we obtain @xmath137{3}c_0\\big)^{-1}\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ m=\\frac{2x^3}{9}\\big(1 + 2\\sqrt[3]{3}c_0\\big)^{-1}\\ , \\label{eqq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is fairly arbitrary .",
    "this solution is independent of @xmath10 value as long as @xmath111 and describes a homogeneous expansion in the newtonian cosmology . in our case ,",
    "the constant @xmath70 is somewhat different from those of the cases with @xmath25 and @xmath121 ( i.e. , a conventional polytropic gas with a constant specific entropy everywhere ) .",
    "we also find that this kind of solutions exists only in two situations : one is @xmath25 and @xmath111 ( see equations ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) of fatuzzo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ) , while the other is @xmath26 also with @xmath111 obtained above .",
    "it is easy to prove that the einstein - de sitter solution only exists in two cases for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for @xmath70",
    "being constant in odes ( [ eq1])@xmath55([eq5 ] ) , equation ( [ eq2 ] ) gives @xmath139 where a natural boundary condition is simply @xmath140 .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) then leads to @xmath141 which also satisfies equation ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "it follows from odes ( [ ma ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) that @xmath142 with @xmath70 being a constant .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath25 , we have @xmath143 , while for @xmath26 , we have a different constant @xmath144 as indicated by solution ( [ eqq ] ) at @xmath4 and @xmath111 . for @xmath23",
    "not equal to these two special values , no einstein - de sitter solution is possible .",
    "however for @xmath57 precisely as in section 3 , equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is of a @xmath145 form and equation ( [ eq3 ] ) defines a particular form of @xmath92 , that is , @xmath146 where @xmath147 is also a constant . by the property of time reversal invariance , this may also describe a particular homologous collapse with @xmath47 being constant and a finite reference radius .",
    "when the determinant of the coefficient matrix of equations ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) vanishes ( see appendix [ a1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath148 where the right - hand side is the polytropic sound speed squared , the relevant odes ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) become singular and no finite first derivatives can be obtained ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this singularity determines a particular surface , referred to as the sonic singular surface in the three variable space of @xmath46 , @xmath149 and @xmath70 .",
    "any solution encountering this sonic singular surface would diverge except for certain special cases which call for additional requirements .",
    "one possibility is to go across the sonic critical curve with weak discontinuities ( e.g. , whitworth & summers 1985 for an isothermal gas ) or to jump across the sonic singular surface with shocks ( e.g. , tsai & hsu 1985 ; shu et al .",

    "the same conclusion can be reached .",
    "our extensive numerical experiments also agree with our analytical analysis as expected ( see figure [ cline ] ) .    for isothermal cases , the projection of the sonic singular surface coincides with that of the sonic critical line .",

    "this is very important in the discussion of shocks because a shock solution needs to jump across the sonic singular surface rather than the sonic critical curve .",

    "the key physical difference is that the einstein - de sitter expansion of the universe is homogeneous ( presumably driven by the ubiquitous dark energy ) while our gas expansion is driven by the thermal gas pressure closely related to gas mass density and temperature .",
    "not only in the case @xmath4 , self - similar void solutions can also be constructed for @xmath19 and isothermal gas which we shall investigate more thoroughly in separate papers .",
    "besides certain similarities with previous polytropic model analysis with @xmath121 , the case of @xmath4 carries its own unique features .",
    "first , because of scaling invariance ( [ scaleinvariance ] ) , various self - similar solutions can be readily classified , especially for the two eigensolutions across the sonic critical line .",
    "once solution properties at a chosen point @xmath46 have been examined completely , other points will have the same solution characteristics by scaling invariance ( [ scaleinvariance ] ) .",
    "this simplifies the analysis to a considerable extent .",
    "fundamentally , the cause of this scale invariance ( [ scaleinvariance ] ) is due to the fact that the sound speed is not involved in self - similar transformation ( [ eq07 ] ) . in various solutions ,",
    "the case of @xmath4 also shows some differences : ( i ) the lp type solution does not exist , except for rare situations ( see appendix [ lp ] ) ; ( ii ) when discussing the quasi - static solution at small @xmath46 , two sensible roots may be found for @xmath14 ( see lou & wang 2006 ) , while one of the two roots is always unacceptable for @xmath4 with only one sensible root being available in our model calculations ; ( iii ) it is no longer possible for a quasi - static solution at small @xmath46 to show a vibration behaviour here .",
    "the solution quickly converges to an outer asymptotic solution ; and ( iv ) the sonic critical lines with constant density are straight lines emanating from the origin in the @xmath268 versus @xmath46 presentation .      to sum up this paper , we have explored possible self - similar solutions , both analytical and numerical , for a generalized polytropic gas with @xmath4 .",
    "the classical analysis of goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) for a constant specific entropy everywhere at all times is substantially extended by specific entropy conservation along streamlines with specific entropy dependent on time and space .",
    "this differs from what yahil ( 1983 ) did in this context .",
    "in addition to counterparts of various previously known types of polytropic solutions with @xmath121 , we find two new asymptotic solutions .",
    "one notable feature is that sonic critical lines are all straight lines emanating from the origin in the @xmath268 versus @xmath46 presentation with constant densities . using all asymptotic solutions available , two eigensolutions across the sonic critical line and self - similar shock conditions ,",
    "global semi - complete solutions are constructed numerically .",
    "two classes of self - similar solutions are investigated separately according to the value of the scaling index @xmath10 . for class i solutions with @xmath57",
    "precisely , we can simulate the homologous evolution of a flow system once the distribution of specific entropy is prescribed .",
    "these more general solutions for a homologous core collapse ( goldreich & weber 1980 ) may be utilized to model the dynamic formation of an inner compact core from a pre - collapse stellar interior .",
    "collapsing solutions of class ii with @xmath111 may also explain the formation of compact objects and other similar flow systems , while expansion solutions with shocks can be utilized to model supernova explosions ( e.g. , lou & wang 2006 , 2007 ) .    by equations ( [ eq1])@xmath55([eq5 ] )",
    ", we emphasize several aspects of solutions for @xmath294 and for @xmath295 . based on our analysis , the einstein - de sitter solution with @xmath4 exists for @xmath296 , @xmath295 and @xmath294 . except for this special einstein - de sitter solution ,",
    "class i solutions valid for @xmath294 can not be obtained by taking the limit of @xmath295 for class ii solutions . in other words ,",
    "class i and ii solutions are qualitatively different solutions and we need to consider them separately . by equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ meq ] ) during the limiting process of @xmath295 , we must require @xmath297 in order to have a finite reduced mass @xmath48 .",
    "only the einstein - de sitter solution and class i solutions with @xmath294 bear this unique feature for the reduced flow speed @xmath49 while all other class ii solutions are excluded by this limiting procedure .",
    "in the course of investigation , we realize the possibility of constructing self - similar solutions for dynamic evolution of central spherical void in a flow system involving self - gravity and thermal pressure . here",
    ", the thermal pressure force drives the gas expansion sufficiently fast and creates a central spherical void by pushing materials outwards . by specific examples ,",
    "we now prove by analytical and numerical calculations that a spherical void can indeed form in astrophysical flow systems under the joint action of thermal pressure force and self - gravity .",
    "we expect that such processes could happen in association with supernova explosions and evolution of supernova remnants . at the beginning of our model formulation , several physical effects , such as nuclear reactions , radiation pressure , neutrino transport , general relativistic effects",
    ", rotational effects and magnetic field , are not taken into account . under various situations",
    ", these effects can be very important in real astrophysical systems . given these approximations and idealizations of our model , it is still hoped that this simple theoretical model framework may catch certain essential characteristics or features of flow phenomena of relevant scenarios and interpretations .",
