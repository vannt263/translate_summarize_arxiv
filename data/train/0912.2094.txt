    "recent x - ray observations of galaxy clusters reveal various phenomena in the gaseous haloes of clusters , such as mergers , cavities , shocks and cold fronts ( cfs ) .",
    "cfs are thought to be contact discontinuities , where the density and temperature jump , while the pressure remains continuous ( up to projection / resolution effects ) .",
    "they are common in clusters @xcite and vary in morphology ( they are often arcs but some radial or filamentary cfs exist ) , contrast ( the density jump is scattered around a value of @xmath1 ) , quiescence ( some are in highly disturbed merging regions , and some in smooth , quiet locations ) , and orientation .",
    "cfs have been postulated to originate from cold material stripped during mergers ( * ? ? ? * for example ) or sloshing of the intergalactic medium ( igm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases ,",
    "a metallicity gradient is observed across the cf , indicating that it results from stripped gas , or radial motions of gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "shear is often found along cfs in relaxed clusters , implying nearly sonic bulk flow beneath the cf @xcite .",
    "whether cfs are present at very large radii ( @xmath2 ) is currently unknown because of observational limitations .    in what follows",
    ", we propose that some cfs are produced by collisions between shocks .",
    "when two trailing shocks collide , a cf is always expected to form .",
    "its parameters can be calculated by solving the shock conditions and corresponding riemann problem .",
    "most of the scenarios in which shocks are produced ( quasars , agn jets , mergers ) predict that shocks will be created at , or near , a cluster center , and expand outwards ( albeit not necessarily isotropically ) .",
    "when one shock trails another , it always propagates faster ( supersonically with respect to the subsonic downstream flow of the leading shock ) , so collisions between outgoing shocks in a cluster are inevitable if they are generated within a sufficiently short time interval .",
    "in   [ sec : riemann ] we solve for the parameters of cfs that are caused by a collision between two arbitrary planar shocks . as a demonstration of the general mechanism ,",
    "we show in   [ sec : virial ] , using 1d spherical cluster simulation that collisions between the virial shock and a secondary shock are expected to produce a distinct pattern of cfs . in   [ sec : observe ] we compare the features of observed cfs with results from our analysis , and list some model - specific predictions . in   [ sec : summary ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "in this section we examine two planar shocks moving in the same direction and calculate the contact discontinuity that forms when the second shock overtakes the leading one . this problem is fully characterized ( up to normalization ) by the mach numbers of the first and second shocks , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . at the instant of collision ,",
    "a discontinuity in velocity , density and pressure develops , corresponding to a riemann problem ( second case in * ? ? ?",
    "the discontinuity evolves into a ( stronger ) shock propagating in the initial direction and a reflected rarefaction wave , separated by a contact discontinuity which we shall refer to as a shock induced cf ( sicf ) .",
    "the density is higher ( and the entropy lower ) on the sicf side closer to the origin of the shocks .",
    "this yields a rayleigh - taylor stable configuration if the shocks are expanding outwards .",
    "now , we derive the discontinuity parameters .",
    "we consider an ideal gas with an adiabatic constant @xmath5 before the shocks collide , denote the unshocked region as zone @xmath6 , the region between the two shocks as zone @xmath7 , and the doubly shocked region as zone @xmath8 .",
    "after the collision , regions @xmath6 and @xmath8 remain intact , but zone @xmath7 vanishes and is replaced by two regions , zone @xmath9 ( adjacent to zone @xmath6 ; the outer region for outgoing spherical shocks ) and zone @xmath10 ( adjacent to @xmath8 ; inner ) , separated by the sicf .",
    "we refer to the plasma density , pressure , velocity and speed of sound respectively as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "velocities of shocks at the boundaries between zones are denoted by @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the upstream zone .",

    "the maximal contrast @xmath41 depends only on the adiabatic index ; for @xmath34 we find @xmath42 , achieved for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "the figure colorscale shows the dimensionless factor @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 , ranging between @xmath47 and @xmath7 for @xmath48 .",

    "taking @xmath50 and a thermal velocity @xmath51 and assuming that a cf is visible if it is sharper than @xmath52 we get a characteristic timescale for cf dissipation , @xmath53 this result indicates that in order for shock induced cfs to be observable , either ( i ) they are formed frequently ( e.g. , by a series of agn bursts ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or ( ii ) magnetic fields reduce the m.f.p . considerably , as some evidence suggests ( see the discussion in * ?",
    "note that the heat flux driven buoyancy instability ( hbi ) tends to preferentially align magnetic fields perpendicular to the heat flow in regions where the temperature decreases in the direction of gravity .",
    "this effect could reduce radial diffusion within the inward cooling regions in the cores of cool core clusters @xcite . across a cf transition",
    "there is a sharp temperature drop towards the inner side , in the direction of gravity .",
    "heat flow could induce hbi on the scale width of the cf , aligning the magnetic fields parallel to the discontinuity and diminishing radial diffusion .",
    "this possibility needs to be addressed further by detailed numerical magneto - hydrodynamic simulations",
    ".     induced by a collision with a shock of mach number @xmath54 arriving from the dense cf side , for @xmath38 the vertical dashed line corresponds to the maximal sicf contrast , @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : mr],width=316 ]    cfs could be degraded by subsequent shocks that sweep outwards across the cf .",
    "however , the cf contrast is only slightly diminished by this effect , by @xmath55 for @xmath56 and a shock mach number @xmath57 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr ] .",
    "such passing shocks seed richtmyer - meshkov instabilities which could cause the cf to break down .",
    "although less efficient than rayleigh - taylor instabilities , these instabilities operate regardless of the alignment with gravity .",
    "the outcome depends on @xmath54 and on any initial small perturbations in the cf surface .",
    "however , the instability is suppressed if the cf becomes sufficiently smoothed .",
    "it is worth noting that khi , which could break down cfs formed through ram pressure stripping and sloshing , does not play an important role in sicfs because there is little or no shear velocity across them . on the other hand ,",
    "the stabilizing alignment of magnetic fields caused by such shear @xcite is also not expected here .",
    "at the edge of galaxy clusters there are virial shocks with typical mach numbers @xmath58 heating the gas from @xmath59 to @xmath60 by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy .",
    "the rate of expansion of a virial shock is set on average by the mass flux and velocity of the infalling material ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "we find in our simulations that while this expansion is steady on average , the shock sometimes oscillates , moving faster or slower than the steady state expansion .",
    "this creates periods dominated by alternating halo compression and expansion . during periods of enhanced compression in the outer halo regions , when the shock slows down , compression is sent inwards and is reflected through the center , gradually steepening into an outgoing shock . when this shock collides with the virial shock , a situation corresponding to that described in ",
    "[ sec : riemann ] , bouncing the virial shock into another cycle of reverberation , creating an sicf and sending inwards a steep rarefaction .",
    "this rarefaction marks the end of the compression period of the next cycle setting the oscillation period to approximately the sound crossing time , in and out across the cluster .",
    "the combined effect is a long - lived , coherent `` breathing '' mode .",
    "such `` breathing '' oscillations are observed in the 3d galactic and cluster halo simulations of @xcite .",
    "using 1d spherical simulations of the formation of clusters from initial cosmic perturbations @xcite , we test the formation and evolution of associated sicfs .",
    "the simulation includes baryonic shells , dark matter shells , and angular momentum support . the oscillatory mode in the simulation",
    "has not been intentionally excited , and results from stochastic inner core ( @xmath61 ) vibrations as external dark matter shells with low angular momentum interact gravitationally with the core .",
    "physically , any waves , shocks or gravitational perturbations ( mergers or agns ) will contribute to the mode , as well as non - smooth accretion rates that would cause the virial shock to vibrate .",
    "a more detailed examination of this is beyond the scope of this letter ( note , however , that the strength of the sicf depends only weakly on the parameters of the secondary shock and is always close to @xmath62 )     is @xmath63 the radius and time of lagrangian shells ( every @xmath64 shell ) are plotted in red thin lines .",
    "shocks are traced by large lagrangian derivatives of the entropy ( @xmath65 , blue dots ) , and cfs are traced by their large entropy gradients ( @xmath66 , green dots ) .",
    "rarefaction waves can be seen as small motions of the lagrangian shells ( illustrated by the dashed magenta curve , manually added based on a time series analysis ) .",

    "the expanding virial shock is traced by a jump in the velocity of the lagrangian shells ( red , thin lines ) , and by the shock - finding algorithm that is based on entropy increase along lagrangian shells ( blue region ) .",
    "the outgoing , secondary shocks that reach the virial shock periodically are also clearly visible .",
    "the virial shock bounces outwards each time it is hit by a secondary .",
    "a rarefaction wave is reflected inwards ( illustrated by a dashed curve ) , and a spherical sicf is left behind .",
    "the sicfs are visible through the entropy gradients ( green region ) , and , in the absence of diffusion and instabilities , persist until @xmath67 as expected , the interaction of the discontinuity with subsequent shocks (  [ sec : stability ] ; fig .",

    "the sicfs formed in this simulation are almost static , and roughly logarithmically spaced .",
    "the calculations presented in figures [ fig : time]-[fig : prof ] are adiabatic .",
    "when cooling is turned on in the absence of feedback , this simulation suffers from overcooling , creating an overmassive bcg of @xmath71 and star formation rates of @xmath72 , and the luminosity exceeds the @xmath73 relation .",
    "the excitation of the basic mode , and periodic cfs , are observed in all these simulations .",
    "the simulation presented here was performed with @xmath74 baryonic and @xmath75 dark matter shells . when the resolution is lowered to @xmath76 baryonic shells , the reverberation amplitude and periods",
    "are essentially unchanged , indicating that the results are well converged .",
    "@xcite present high quality chandra observations of @xmath77 relaxed cfs .",
    "they all seem concentric with respect to the cluster center , and spherical in appearance . @xcite interpret these as evidence for sloshing , and find spiral characteristics in @xmath8 of them .",
    "we argue here that some cfs of this type could originate from shock collisions . in the sicf model ,",
    "cfs are spherical , unlike the truncated cfs formed by ram pressure stripping or sloshing , so no special projection orientation is required . on the other hand ,",
    "sicfs do not involve metallicity discontinuities , observed in some of these cfs .",
    "the observed contrasts of these cfs are quite uniform , with best fit values in the range @xmath78 ( with @xmath79 uncertainty ) in all three , as expected for sicfs , regardless of cf origin .",
    "a larger , more complete sample of cfs is needed to determine the origin / s of the relaxed population . ] .    the sicf formation model is entirely distinct from ram pressure stripping and sloshing cfs , and it makes many different predictions .    * morphology . * sicfs are quasi - spherical around the source of the shocks .",
    "a galactic merger defines an orbit plane , and the corresponding perturbation ( stripped material or center displacement ) will create cfs parallel to this plane . in some sloshing scenarios @xcite the cfs extend considerably above the plane , but would never appear as a full circle on the sky ; an observed cf `` ring '' would strongly point towards an sicf .",
    "the statistical properties of a large cf sample could thus be used to distinguish between the different scenarios",
    ".    * amplitude .",
    "* sicfs have distinct entropy and density contrasts that depend weakly on shock parameters ; @xmath37 is typically larger than @xmath80 ( assuming @xmath81 ) and is always smaller than @xmath82 .",
    "* extent . *",
    "if the cluster reverberation mode is excited , sicf radii should be approximately logarithmically spaced .",
    "any shock that expands and collides with the virial shock will create sicf at the location of the virial shock , far beyond the core .",
    "the external sicfs are younger , and would appear sharper owing to less diffusion and collisions with secondary shocks .",
    "deep observations capable of detecting cfs at @xmath83 are predicted to find sicfs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] ) .",
    "such distant cfs occur naturally only in the sicf model",
    ".    * plasma diagnostics .",
    "* shocks are known to modify plasma properties in a non - linear manner , for example by accelerating particles to high energies and amplifying / generating magnetic fields .",
    "the plasmas on each side of an sicf may thus differ , being processed either by two shocks or by one , stronger shock .",
    "this may allow indirect detection of the cf , in particular if the two shocks were strong before the collision .",
    "for example , enhanced magnetic fields below the cf may be observable as excess synchrotron emission from radio relics that extend across the cf , in nearby clusters , using future high - resolution radio telescopes ( lofar , ska ) .",
    "our study consists of two parts .",
    "the first is a general discussion about cfs that form as a result of a collision between two trailing shocks .",
    "the second part describes a specific reverberation mode of galaxy and cluster haloes that has been identified in 1d simulations , and also seen in 3d .",
    "one aspect of these reverberations is periodic collisions between the virial shock and outgoing secondary shocks , resulting in sicfs  a special case of the mechanism discussed in the first part of our paper .",
    "we have shown that when shocks move in the same direction they collide and generate a cf .",
    "the density contrast across the cf is calculated as a function of the mach numbers of the two shocks .",
    "it is typically larger than @xmath84 ( if @xmath85 ) , and is always smaller than @xmath82 .",
    "the discontinuity is smeared over time by diffusion , at a rate that depends on the unknown nature and amplitude of magnetic fields .",
    "cfs are susceptible to heat - flux - driven buoyancy instability ( hbi ) , which could align the magnetic field tangent to the cf and potentially moderate further diffusion .",
    "sicfs , like all other cfs , are subject to richtmyer - meshkov instabilities from subsequent shocks passing through the cluster .",
    "such collisions reduce the cf contrast until it reaches @xmath70 . unlike most other cf models",
    ", an sicf is not expected to suffer from khi .    in ",
    "[ sec : virial ] , using a 1d spherical hydrodynamic code to evolve cosmological perturbations , we demonstrate that a reverberation mode exists in the haloes of galaxies and clusters and causes periodic collisions between the virial shocks and secondary shocks that produce sicf .",
    "the simulated sicf contrast is consistent with the theoretical predictions of   [ sec : riemann ] .",
    "a more thorough investigation of this potentilly important mode , including its stability in 3d is left for future works .",
    "we use it here as a specific scenario for sicf formation .",
    "the predicted properties of sicfs are presented in  [ sec : observe ] , and reproduce some of the cf features discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we suggest that cfs in relaxed clusters , with no evidence of mergers , shear , or chemical discontinuities , may have formed by shock collisions .",
    "we list the properties of sicfs that could distinguish them from cfs formed by other mechanisms .",
    "the sicf model predicts quasi - spherical cfs which are concentric about the cluster center , with contrast @xmath39 and possibly extending as far out as the virial shock .",
    "an observed closed ( circular / oval ) cf could only be an sicf . in the specific case of cluster reverberation",
    ", a distinct spacing pattern between cfs is expected .",
    "it may be possible to detect them indirectly , for example as discontinuities superimposed on peripheral radio emission .",
    "shocks originating from the cluster center naturally occur in feedback models that are invoked to solve the overcooling problem .",
    "they are also formed by mergers of substructures with the bcg .",
    "thus , sicfs should be a natural phenomenon in clusters .",
    "further work is needed to assess how common sicfs are with respect to other types of cfs , and to characterize inner sicfs that could result , for example , from collisions between offset agn shocks .",
