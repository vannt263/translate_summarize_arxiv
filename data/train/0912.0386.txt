    "the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( _ fermi _ ) , succeeding the energetic gamma ray experiment ( egret ) , was launched in june 2008 to cover the energy range of 20  mev to 300  gev , with a sensitivity approximately a hundred times better than that of the egret . the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ surveyed the entire sky for 3 months , after which the 205 most significant sources were published in a bright source list above 100  mev at a significance greater than @xmath610@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this survey detected many new @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "a typical 95% uncertainty radius of source position in this list is approximately 10@xmath7 and the maximum is 20@xmath7 ; these values are greatly improved compared to those of the egret .",
    "this provides a more accurate , unbiased search for common sources across multi wavelengths , compared with the egret era .",
    "recently , the milagro experiment observed 14 of the 34 _ fermi _ sources selected from the list at a false - positive significance of 3@xmath1 or more at the representative energy of 35  tev @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a search for tev @xmath0-ray sources in the _ fermi _ bright source list with the tibet - iii air shower array ( tibet - iii array ) .",
    "we also discuss simple statistical tests for our results and possible coincidences with the milagro observations .",
    "the tibet air shower array has been operating at yangbajing cosmic ray observatory ( @xmath8 east , @xmath9 north ; 4300  m above sea level ) in tibet , china , since 1990 @xcite .",
    "we observe cosmic rays and @xmath0-rays using the extensive air shower technique of a scintillation detector array with a duty cycle of about 24 hours every day regardless of weather conditions , and with a wide field of view of about 2  sr .",
    "these capabilities give us an unbiased survey of the northern sky .",
    "after several upgrades , the tibet - iii array was completed and started collecting data in late 1999 .",
    "this array consists of 533 plastic scintillation detectors of 0.5  m@xmath10 placed at grid point 7.5  m apart , and its coverage area is approximately 22,050 m@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "each detector , called a fast - timing ( ft ) detector , has an ft photomultiplier tube to collect scintillation photons .",
    "the number of air shower particles and the arrival timing of particles at each detector are recorded , allowing us to estimate primary cosmic ray or @xmath0-ray direction and energy for each air shower .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the absolute energy scale observed by the tibet - iii array in the multi - tev region is calibrated to be less than @xmath1212% using the moon s shadow observation @xcite .",
    "the single event angular resolution is estimated to be @xmath13 for modal energy 3  tev , although it depends on the observed number of air shower particles .",
    "the systematic pointing error is also estimated to be smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "these are verified by the moon s shadow observation @xcite .    using the tibet - iii and previous arrays , we have successfully observed tev @xmath0-ray sources , such as the crab nebula @xcite , mrk  501 @xcite , and mrk  421 @xcite .",
    "we have also successfully drawn a precise two - dimensional map of the large - scale cosmic - ray anisotropy in the northern sky @xcite , where we first pointed out new small - area enhancements in the cygnus arm direction at multi - tev energies .",
    "one of the enhancements is coincident with mgro  j2019 + 37 , which was established recently by the milagro experiment as a tev @xmath0-ray source @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the tibet as@xmath0 experiment has reported several times @xcite on the marginal excesses from the direction closing to mgro  j1908 + 06/hess j1908 + 063 before the final discovery made by the milagro experiment .",
    "we analyze the air shower dataset collected by the tibet - iii array during 1915.5 live days from 1999 november through 2008 december . to extract an excess of tev @xmath0-ray air shower events coming from the direction of a target source in this analysis ,",
    "we adopt almost the same event selections and the background estimation method published in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we use air shower events with @xmath15 as the primary energy reference , where the size @xmath16 is defined as the sum of the number of particles per m@xmath10 for each ft detector .",
    "the modal @xmath0-ray energy , assuming the crab s orbit and integral spectral index @xmath171.6 , is calculated to be approximately 3  tev by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the modal @xmath0-ray energy depends on the declination and is estimated to be @xmath63  tev for a declination band from 20@xmath18 to 40@xmath18 and @xmath66  tev for declinations at 0@xmath18 and 60@xmath18 , respectively . the search window radius centered at the target source",
    "is expressed by @xmath19 degrees , which is shown to maximize the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio by monte carlo study assuming a point - like @xmath0-ray source @xcite .",
    "therefore , an excess might be underestimated if the target source actually extends beyond our angular resolution size .",
    "the target sources in the _ fermi _ bright source list are chosen as confirmed or potential galactic sources in a similar way to that employed by the milagro observation @xcite . out of the 205 most significant sources in the _",
    "fermi _ bright source list , 83 are not identified as extragalactic sources @xcite . among these 83",
    ", we select 27 sources in the declination band between 0@xmath18 and 60@xmath18 , corresponding to our sensitive field of view for tev @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the tibet - iii array observation of the selected 27 _ fermi _ bright galactic sources is summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] , where 13 of the selected sources are classified as pulsars ( psr ) , 5 are supernova remnants ( snr ) , and 9 remain unidentified but are potential galactic sources , as they are mostly concentrated in the galactic plane ( @xmath20 ) @xcite . as a result of this excess search for these sources , we find no statistically significant evidence for tev @xmath0-rays from other individual sources except for the crab , which is recognized as the brightest standard tev source .",
    "subsequently , the distribution of the observed significance is examined for statistical consistency with the normal gaussian .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the significance distribution of the 27 sources observed by the tibet - iii array .",
    "one can see that the @xmath0-rays from the crab are detected at a sufficiently high significance of 6.9@xmath1 .",
    "it should be emphasized that we observe 7 sources including the crab at a significance of 2@xmath1 or more in this distribution , against an expected 0.61 sources ( upper probability of 2@xmath1 multiplied by 27 sources ) from the normal gaussian . the chance probability from poisson statistics",
    "would be estimated as 3.8@xmath210@xmath3 . with",
    "the crab excluded , the chance probability would be estimated as 3.6@xmath210@xmath4 .",
    "this low chance probability clearly shows that the _ fermi _ bright galactic sources have statistically significant correlations with the tev @xmath0-ray excesses . in order to check the possible bias of the data sample ,",
    "spatially independent dummy sources are selected from the northern sky except for the crab , mrk  421 , and two famous large - scale cosmic - ray anisotropy regions known as the loss - cone and the tail - in regions @xcite .",
    "the loss - cone and the tail - in regions are separated from the selected 27 _ fermi _ sources . as a result ,",
    "the significance distribution of @xmath62000 dummy sources is consistent with the normal gaussian with a mean value of @xmath21 and a standard deviation of @xmath22 .",
    "if the significance distribution observed by the tibet - iii array has a density gradient toward the galactic plane , the expected number of sources at 2@xmath1 or more may be enhanced in chance association . to check this",
    ", we perform a simple monte carlo simulation in a similar way to that implemented by romero et al .",
    "we generate 2000 dummy - source lists of the 27 _ fermi _ bright galactic sources , where the galactic latitude distributions retain the form of the actual histograms of the _ fermi _ sources with the galactic longitudes randomly set to new distributions within our field of view .",
    "we count the number of @xmath52@xmath1 sources in the tibet - iii data according to each dummy - source list , and calculate that the average expected number of sources at 2@xmath1 or more is 0.73@xmath120.02 in the chance association . in this case , the chance probability associated with 7 sources or more goes up slightly , to 1.2@xmath210@xmath4 , while it becomes 9.7@xmath210@xmath4 with the crab excluded .",
    "the milagro observation found 14 out of 34 _ fermi _ sources at a significance of 3@xmath1 or more , and its sensitivity is approximately two or three times better than that of the tibet - iii array .",
    "hence , our threshold significance 2@xmath1 , which corresponds to @xmath630% of the crab flux assuming a point - like source , should be a reasonable value .",
    "we note that the flux of 0fgl  j2020.8 + 3649 seems to be quite low compared with the milagro s , since the flux measurement of 0fgl  j2020.8 + 3649 with the milagro experiment is ( 67@xmath127)% of the crab flux above 35  tev , while our flux is ( 30@xmath1214)% of the crab flux above 3  tev .",
    "the statistical difference between them is calculated to be 2.3@xmath1 .",
    "this difference may be explained by either statistical fluctuations , a harder energy spectrum than that of the crab , or an extended source instead of the assumed point - like source in this analysis .",
    "we also find that all 7 sources at 2@xmath1 or more are associated with pulsars , and 6 of them are coincident with sources detected by the milagro experiment at a significance of 3@xmath1 or more at the representative energy of 35  tev .",
    "the remaining source still has a positive significance of 1.4@xmath1 measured by the milagro experiment .",
    "furthermore , the latest _ fermi _ lat observations detected 16 @xmath0-ray pulsars in the blind frequency searches @xcite , among which only lat  psr  j2238 + 59 is a new pulsar not included in the _ fermi _ bright source list .",
    "we also find a 2.5@xmath1 excess associated with lat  psr  j2238 + 59 , as listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the location of this pulsar is observed at a significance of 4.7@xmath1 by the milagro experiment @xcite . in this connection",
    ", the first _ fermi _ lat catalog including 46 @xmath0-ray pulsars has been published using the first 6 months of data @xcite .",
    "we remark that no pulsed emission has ever been detected from @xmath0-ray pulsars above a few tens of gev @xcite .    around the _ fermi _ galactic bright sources with @xmath52@xmath1 significance by the tibet - iii data and @xmath53@xmath1 by the milagro data except for the crab , we compare significance maps between the tibet - iii array ( a)(d ) and the milagro experiment ( a)(d ) taken from abdo et al .",
    "( 2009b ) in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "each image has a @xmath23 region including one or two _ fermi _ sources .",
    "it is remarkable that the tibet - iii array obtains images consistent with those observed in the milagro experiment . besides",
    ", the maximum significance positions obtained by both the tibet - iii array and the milagro experiment might be shifted from the pulsar positions .",
    "in fact , recent imaging air cherenkov telescopes also discovered many candidates for tev pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , which are displaced within a few tenths of degree from the pulsars in the southern sky @xcite .",
    "thus , these observations would imply that the excesses are possible candidates for tev pwne .",
    "the correlation between tev and gev @xmath0-rays is being realized by the wide sky survey instruments , such as the tibet - iii array and the milagro experiment , in the early _ fermi _ era .",
    "the collaborative experiment of the tibet air shower arrays has been performed under the auspices of the ministry of science and technology of china and the ministry of foreign affairs of japan .",
