    "dense baryonic matter at low temperature and asymptotically large chemical potential is known to be a color superconductor @xcite .",
    "this can be shown in the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) . to explore the color superconducting phase at moderate chemical potential",
    ", however , it is necessary to use effective models , such as the well - known njl model with four - fermion interaction @xcite . using an appropriate njl type model",
    ", one can show that at baryon densities @xmath7 mev , i.e. only several times larger than the density of nuclear matter , the two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase might be present @xcite ( see @xcite for recent reviews on color superconductivity in dense quark matter ) .",
    "different astrophysical processes might therefore be influenced by the color superconductivity that is supposed to exist inside the compact stars . in @xcite",
    ", the competition between the chiral symmetry breaking and the color symmetry breaking condensates is investigated in the framework of a two - flavor color neutral njl type model , including meson and diquark condensates , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . imposing the color neutrality condition , it is found that in the 2sc phase at @xmath10 mev , the color chemical potential @xmath3 acquires rather small values of about @xmath11 mev . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the critical chemical potential .",
    "the diquark mass gap is numerically computed to be @xmath13 mev .",
    "it is also shown that the appearance of a coexistence regime ( mixed phase ) depends directly on the relative strength of the meson and diquark coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is also indicated in @xcite , where it is stated that neglecting the quark masses and choosing @xmath16 , no mixed phase appears at @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath0sb and csc phases can therefore be studied separately under these conditions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the mesons and diquarks in the color neutral 2sc phase of cold and dense quark matter in the presence of constant magnetic fields .",
    "the aim is to study the effect of the magnetic field on the formation of chiral as well as diquark condensates , the dependence of mass gaps on the chemical potential @xmath18 and the external magnetic field , the phase diagram @xmath18 vs. @xmath19 , and the effect of nonvanishing color chemical potential on the type of phase transitions for different @xmath18 and @xmath19 at zero temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the study of quark matter in the presence of constant magnetic field is relevant for the astrophysics of compact stars : strong magnetic fields exist on the surface of compact stars . for neutron stars the magnetic fields @xmath21 gau , whereas for magnetars",
    ", they can be as large as @xmath22 gau   @xcite .",
    "in the interiors of compact stars , the magnetic field can be even several orders of magnitude larger @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is believed that the superdense interior of compact stars may be composed of electric and color neutral quark matter in the color superconducting phase . to test the predictions of astrophysical signatures of color superconductivity ,",
    "a better understanding of the rle of magnetic fields on the csc phase is important .",
    "the study of superconducting phase in the presence of external magnetic fields is also relevant for the physics of heavy ion collisions : according to @xcite , in off - central collisions , heavy ions possess a very large angular momentum and very strong magnetic fields can be created . in @xcite , it is shown that the magnetic field presently created at rhic is at most @xmath23 gau , and the estimated value of the magnetic field strength for the lhc energy amounts to @xmath24 gau .",
    "recently , the question of accessibility of the 2sc phase in the future heavy ion collision experiments is investigated in @xcite . here , the authors do not consider the effect of the before mentioned magnetic fields .",
    "it would be therefore important to study the effect of external magnetic fields on the formation of 2sc diquark condensates , as well as the corresponding phase structure in the presence of external magnetic fields .",
    "as for the results presented in this paper , they may be relevant only for the physics of the heavy ion collisions , because in contrary to the electric and color neutrality requirement of the superdense core of the compact stars , only the color neutrality condition is considered in this paper .    the effect of constant magnetic field on the formation of diquark condensates has been investigated by several authors . in @xcite , it is shown that there is a linear combination of photon and a gluon that remains massless .",
    "the resulting `` rotated '' external magnetic field can therefore penetrate the color superconducting region without being affected by the meissner effect .",
    "this has consequences for the structure of compact star cores . in @xcite ,",
    "the formation of magnetic color - flavor locked ( mcfl ) phase , as well as the transition to the paramagnetic - cfl ( pcfl ) phase are studied . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that for small magnetic fields , the cfl mass gap as well as the corresponding magnetization exhibit small oscillations , the van alfven  de haas ( vadh ) oscillations .",
    "this effect , which is well - known from condensed matter physics , is predicted by landau and observed experimentally by van alfven and de haas ( see @xcite for an investigation of this effect in cold dense quark matter in a homogeneous magnetic field ) .",
    "the transport properties of 2sc phase is investigated recently in @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the formation of chiral and diquark condensates as well as their competition in the 2sc phase at zero temperature and moderate densities are studied using the same njl type model as in the present paper .",
    "it is shown that for vanishing magnetic field , a mixed broken phase can be found where both chiral and superconducting gaps are non - zero . for @xmath25 gev@xmath26 ( corresponding to @xmath27 gau ) and moderate diquark - to - chiral coupling ratios @xmath28 ,",
    "the chiral and superconducting transitions become weaker . for large @xmath28",
    ", strong magnetic fields disrupt the mixed broken phase region and a first order phase transition is found between the @xmath0sb and the csc phase for @xmath25 gev@xmath26 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , our results include a detailed analytical and numerical survey on the effect of external magnetic field and color chemical potential on cold and dense as well as color neutral quark matter in the presence of external magnetic fields .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , starting from an extended lagrangian density of a gauged njl model containing two flavors , and following the method presented in @xcite , we introduce the rotated magnetic field @xmath29 and determine the lagrangian density containing the @xmath0sb and csc mass gaps , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . in sec .",
    "iii , the one - loop effective action and thermodynamic potential of the model are determined at zero temperature and finite quark chemical potential . in sec .",
    "iv , assuming very strong magnetic fields , we solve analytically the gap equations corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as the color chemical potential @xmath3 in an appropriate lll approximation .",
    "the @xmath0sb and the csc phases are studied , in iv.a and iv.b , separately .",
    "this is possible because of our specific choice of free parameters , the quark mass @xmath30 and the meson and diquark couplings @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the @xmath0sb phase , characterized by @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ", the magnetic field enhances the bound state formation .",
    "this is because of the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis @xcite studied intensively in the past few years . in the csc phase , characterized by @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "we determine analytically the @xmath18 and @xmath29 dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the regime of lll dominance . in sec .",
    "v , a numerical analysis is performed to study the @xmath29 dependence of the @xmath0sb and csc mass gaps at @xmath36 mev ( in the @xmath0sb regime ) and @xmath37 mev ( in the csc regime ) . for small values of @xmath29",
    ", we observe vadh oscillations in the mass gaps as well as the corresponding magnetizations , as expected .",
    "these are also observed in @xcite for three - flavor cfl phase at @xmath38 mev . at @xmath39 gev@xmath40 ,",
    "the oscillations end up in a `` linear regime '' .",
    "comparing eventually our numerical results for @xmath41 gev@xmath40 with the analytical results arising in sec .",
    "iv for strong magnetic fields in the lll approximation , we conclude that this approximation is only reliable in the above linear regime .",
    "the @xmath18-dependence of the mass gaps and the color chemical potential is also discussed for various @xmath29 .",
    "our results for vanishing @xmath29 coincide with the results in @xcite .",
    "we also present the phase structure of @xmath0sb and csc phases in a @xmath6 plane .",
    "in particular , we are interested on the effect of the color chemical potential @xmath3 on the phase structure of the model .",
    "as it turns out , for @xmath42 , a first order phase transition exists between the @xmath0sb and the csc phase in the regime @xmath43 mev and @xmath44 $ ] gev@xmath40 , whereas the transition from the csc to the normal phase is of second order and occurs at @xmath45 mev . for @xmath46 , however , whereas the phase transition between the @xmath0sb and the csc phase is still of first order , the second order phase transition between the csc and the normal phase goes over into a first order phase transition between the csc and the normal phase at @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 gev@xmath40 .",
    "note that the first order nature of the transition between the @xmath0sb and csc phases was expected from @xcite , where the type of phase transition between these two phases is studied for a fixed @xmath25 gev@xmath40 and various @xmath28 ratios .",

    "the effective potential of this model can be determined as a function of the condensates @xmath82 , @xmath83,@xmath84 and @xmath85 . for simplicity we set @xmath86 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the effect of a constant background @xmath4 magnetic field on the formation of these condensates . to do this",
    ", we have , principally , to replace @xmath74 by a classical @xmath87 and a dynamical part @xmath88 and then integrate out the dynamical gauge field @xmath88 and @xmath75 .",
    "however , it turns out that for non - vanishing @xmath89 , both gauge fields @xmath74 and @xmath75 are massive and underlie the meissner effect .",

    "they are therefore unappropriate to be taken as external fields .",
    "but , as it is shown in @xcite , there is indeed a linear combination of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , that leads to a massless `` rotated '' @xmath4 field , @xmath95 , and a massive `` rotated '' @xmath96 field , @xmath97 . according to @xcite , the angle @xmath98 can be determined from @xmath99 to rotate the fields , one uses the identity @xmath100 and insert the combination @xmath101 on the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of this identity . here , @xmath102 is an appropriate rotation matrix including sine and cosine of @xmath98 .",
    "the identity ( [ f7 ] ) not only determines the new rotated fields as a linear combination of the original non - rotated ones , it also fixes the relation between the rotated and non - rotated couplings as @xmath103 , as well as @xmath104 . in the rotated system",
