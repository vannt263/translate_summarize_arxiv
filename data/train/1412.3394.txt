    "improved understanding of the influence of disorder in solids yields potential new approaches to the state - of - the - art design of multicomponent materials . despite the popular view that disorder should be avoided by any means",
    ", one can find its constructive influence on physical properties in various applied fields .",
    "examples include the disorder - induced mechanical work hardening of materials  @xcite , `` softer '' examples such as the efficient blocking of sound waves in liquid foams  @xcite , and the anderson localization of light in disordered photonic crystals  @xcite . by carefully reviewing the literature",
    ", one finds many more constructive examples .",
    "constructive disorder simply prevents the propagation of certain quasiparticles .",
    "indeed , in the first example , mechanical dislocations are blocked by other type of random defects ; in the second , ultrasonic phonons are blocked by random foam bubbles ; and in the third , electromagnetic waves are blocked by the breaking of the translational symmetry in the photonic crystal . of course , similar phenomena also accompany electronic propagation in metals , where the breaking of translational symmetry ( static or dynamic ) leads to a nonzero resistivity . here , one of the most dramatic examples is the anderson localization  @xcite , which completely blocks the propagation of an electron despite the absence of a semiconducting gap in the density of states .",
    "this can have constructive implications , for example , it has recently been proposed that anderson localization induced in topologically non - trivial systems , such as hgte - type semimetals , should result in a new class of topological insulator  @xcite . on the other hand , in `` typical '' metals ( i.e. , systems with a conducting electron density of @xmath1  @xmath2 ) , the anderson - mott criterion  @xcite ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bohr radius )",
    "can not be fulfilled , so an unlimited increase in disorder leads to a saturation of metallic resistivity which , in practice , is restricted by the empirical mooij limit , @xmath5 cm  @xcite .    here",
    ", we would like to demonstrate another interesting effect that can be induced by disorder in metallic systems , the so - called _ spin - selective _ electron localization . specifically",
    ", we will justify the possibility of creating such a type of disorder , which noticeably localizes the conducting electrons of one spin but almost negligibly affects the conduction of the other spin .",
    "it is rather clear that , since the spin subbands in a magnetic metal are different , their conductivities also differ ( i.e. @xmath6 ) .",
    "the extreme case , which is especially interesting in terms of spintronics , is the half - metallicity ( i.e. @xmath7 , @xmath8 or vice versa ) characterized by the highest possible amplitude of the spin - polarization , @xmath9 .",
    "it can be realized in the special class of materials known as half - metals  @xcite , which possess a semiconducting band gap in one spin channel only ( i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 or vice versa ) .",
    "however , as one can see in the simple drude picture , @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the conductivity also scales with an electronic mean free path @xmath13 , providing the potential for @xmath14 , to be adjusted by manipulation of the electron mobilities , @xmath15 , in different spin channels , rather than adjusting the @xmath16 only .",
    "a large number of mechanisms exist that favor the disorder in solids provided by a diverse manifold of the degrees of freedom , whether thermal ( such as phonons , magnons , polarons ) or fully intrinsic ( such as through geometrical frustration , stoichiometric variations and electron interaction ) . in order to engineer such mechanisms efficiently",
    ", one must understand their impact on the electronic structure . at present",
    ", certain connections can be established using special mean - field theories ( e.g. coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite or dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite ) , statistical methods ( e.g. monte - carlo - based simulations ) or combined approaches .    here",
    ", we will restrict our engineering to a very fundamental level by improving the ground - state electronic transport characteristics through a particular type of chemical disorder , as it is one of the most common phenomena in polyatomic solid compositions .",
    "the simplest way to introduce chemical disorder is through variation of the stoichiometry . here",
    ", a convenient test environment is provided by the heusler family of materials , which typically have a ternary composition : two different transition metals ( tm ) and one main - group element ( mg ) .",
    "the majority of these substances crystallize in the fcc - based cubic structure ( centrosymmetric @xmath17 or noncentrosymmetric @xmath18 ) and obey the same chemical ordering rules  @xcite . by substituting one tm for another tm or one mg by another mg ,",
    "the properties of heusler materials can be varied widely without affecting their structure , from nonmagnetic / semiconducting to magnetic / metallic .",
    "in particular , the latter class includes the majority of the known half - metals as given in refs .",
    "a nonstoichiometric substitution will lead to a random occupation of the corresponding wyckoff sites , by automatically breaking the translational invariance .",
    "this random site occupation by two or more elements with localized electronic subbands ( e.g. @xmath19 states ) centered at different energies will disturb the coherent scattering of the delocalized ( mobile ) electrons at corresponding energies and result in their partial localization .",
    "thus , if the nonstoichiometric substitution induces these random fluctuations within the energy window containing the fermi level ( @xmath20 ) , the resistivity will increase .",
    "the concept is therefore clear ; we must create such an energy window at @xmath20 in one spin channel , and simultaneously shift it away from @xmath20 in the other channel .",
    "such a situation can be maintained , obviously , only in magnetic systems .",
    "we select mn@xmath0ga heusler as a suitable object , since it possesses strong local moments and is not a half - metal .",
    "this is because of its tetragonal distortion which reduces its point symmetry to @xmath21 .",
    "chemically speaking it is a binary , however , it contains two types of mn in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 wyckoff positions ( marked red and blue , respectively , in fig .",

    ", we label this compound as mngamnmn .",
    "( b )  substituting a late tm in place of mn ( @xmath27 , light - green ) results in a mngamn[mn-@xmath27 ] alloy with mn-@xmath27 disorder on @xmath29 sites .",
    "( c )  replacing mn with an early tm ( @xmath30 , light - blue ) results in a [ mn-@xmath30]gamnmn alloy with mn-@xmath30 disorder on @xmath22 .",

    "the atom - projected dos contributions obey the same color code as that used for the atoms ; vertical colored bars indicate the energy windows in which the electronic levels randomly fluctuate . ]    which differ by their nearest neighbor environment .",
    "mn@xmath32 has the largest local moment ( according to different measurements and first - principles estimations @xmath333 - 4  @xmath34 ) coupled antiparallel to mn@xmath35 , which has a smaller moment of @xmath332 - 3  @xmath34 . since the @xmath23 class contains two mn atoms ( in @xmath36 and @xmath29 , which are equivalent ) , the total magnetization , @xmath37 , is oriented along the @xmath23 local moments .",
    "( f.u.=formula unit ) according to the first - principles calculation  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and @xmath39/f.u . according to experiment  @xcite (",
    "note that the saturation was not achieved ) .",
    "let us examine the energetic structures of our future scattering centers ( localized 3@xmath40 states of mn ) .",
    "they are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]a .",
    "mn(@xmath22 ) , which exhibits the strongest magnetic moment , is close to the half - filled state .",
    "its @xmath19 shell contains five spin - down electrons , whereas the spin - up states are empty ( ideally this should result in 5  @xmath34 , however , this can differ in calculations , since the amplitude of the local moment depends on the position at which the `` border '' between the atoms is set ) . on the other hand",
    ", mn@xmath35 exhibits a smaller moment and weaker exchange split ; this simply means that , whereas the spin - up band is fully filled , the spin - down band is not fully empty , i.e. , it contains @xmath20 .",
    "such a `` half - metallic '' structure of the localized electronic subsystem ( the delocalized @xmath41 and @xmath42 conducting electrons , which are not shown in the scheme , do not have a band gap in any of the spin channels ) fits well into the framework of the anderson impurity model  @xcite , which explains the spin dependence of the conducting electron scattering on a given magnetic impurity . in the second - order perturbation theory ,",
    "the scattering process involves an intermediate state in which a conducting electron occupies an impurity level . at @xmath20 ,",
    "this is a partially filled spin - down @xmath19 subband of mn@xmath35 . according to the pauli exclusion principle",
    ", intermediate states in which the impurity level is occupied by two electrons with the same spin orientation are forbidden .",
    "thus , the spin - down conducting electrons will be repelled from the mn@xmath35 spin - down subband more strongly , which results in a relative increase in the spin - down resistivity component , @xmath43 .",
    "the only ingredient which is still missing is the chemical disorder on the @xmath23 sites , which leads to a random fluctuation of the spin - down localized @xmath40-electron subband by causing it to become an efficient scattering center .",
    "this type of disorder can be introduced by substituting some other tm in place of mn .",
    "one of the general rules , that holds quite unambiguously for heusler alloys concerns their chemical ordering  ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the _ earliest _ tm ( which is located closer to the left side of the periodic table , i.e. , which belongs to the earliest group ) shares the same atomic layer as the mg element ( e.g. , if ga occupies @xmath25 , the earliest tm occupies the @xmath22 wyckoff site ) .",
    "thus , for mn-@xmath27 substitution with the _ later _ tms , @xmath27 = fe , co , ni , cu , the earliest tm is mn , which therefore remains in @xmath22 . for this reason",
    ", @xmath27 will randomly occupy the @xmath23 wyckoff sites .",
    "as follows from the present calculations ( in the case of @xmath27 = fe , co , ni and also experimentally  @xcite ) , such substitution preferably occurs on one of the two @xmath23 sites ( @xmath36 or @xmath29 ; here , let us choose @xmath29 ) by rendering them nonequivalent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]b ) . according to the sequence @xmath26",
    ", we label the resulting compound mngamn[mn@xmath44 .",
    "statistically , its point symmetry reduces from @xmath21 to @xmath45 ( no inversion ) . due to similarity with mn@xmath46",
    "the magnetic moments of @xmath47 are coupled negatively to mn@xmath32 , i.e. , they are oriented up . since @xmath47 has a smaller magnetic moment compared to mn@xmath46 ( because of its more complete @xmath40-shell ) , its partially occupied spin - down subband is downshifted energetically with respect to mn(@xmath48 ) , whereas its fully occupied spin - up subband is centered below @xmath20 , similar to the spin - up subband of mn@xmath46 .",
    "it is clear that such substitution yields the spin - down random fluctuation window including @xmath20 , whereas the spin - up window is situated below @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]b ) .",
    "a similar effect can be maintained by replacing mn with earlier tms : @xmath30 = cr , v , ti and sc . according to the aforementioned chemical ordering rules , the earlier tms occupy the @xmath22 wyckoff site , which is represented in formal notation as [ mn@xmath49gamnmn ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]c ) .",
    "this does not change the @xmath21 point symmetry .",
    "because of the similarity with mn@xmath32 , the magnetic moments of @xmath50 are also coupled negatively to mn@xmath35 , i.e. are down - oriented . since the @xmath40-shell of the @xmath30 element is less than half - filled , its spin - up subband is fully empty ( it is situated above @xmath20 ) , whereas the spin - down subband is partially filled ( contains @xmath20 ) .",
    "this again provides two randomly fluctuating energy windows : one including @xmath20 , in the spin - down channel , and the other one , above @xmath20 in the spin - up channel . an additional energy regime of random fluctuations which occurs in the spin - down channel relatively far below @xmath20 exists , which is caused by the deepest fluctuating spin - down subband of mn(@xmath22 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]c .",
    "since both substitutions [ mn@xmath49gamnmn and mngamn[mn@xmath44 are independent , they can be simultaneously combined into [ mn@xmath49gamn[mn@xmath44 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]d .",
    "the resulting compound statistically corresponds to the lowest @xmath45 symmetry , and its fluctuation spectrum represents a superposition of the energy windows in cases ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we assume , that the substitution rate , @xmath51 or @xmath52 , must be sufficiently small everywhere to prevent noticeable structural or electronic changes . experimentally , in the case of @xmath27 = co , the critical concentration ( when the mn@xmath53ga composition reaches into the cubic phase ) is @xmath54 ; in the case of @xmath27 = fe or ni , it is at least @xmath55  @xcite . to date , cases of mn-@xmath30 substitution have not been reported apart from @xmath30 = v , known to be cubic for @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , among all the cases considered here , the practically interesting examples are those in which the substitution rate does not exceed @xmath57% ( @xmath58 ) . nevertheless ,",
    "since it is interesting to also track the spin - polarization at the disorder rate maximum , we will study mn@xmath53ga and mn@xmath59ga within a wide range ( @xmath60 ) . to examine the effects of the combined substitution ( in mn@xmath61ga )",

    ", almost no broadening of the spin - up states is observed at @xmath20 , as the spin - up fluctuation window is now shifted above @xmath20 ( from @xmath73 to 2  ev ) . in the combined mn@xmath70v@xmath68co@xmath68ga case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bsf - dos]d ) the fluctuation regime clearly represents a superposition of the fluctuation energy windows in figs .",
    "[ fig : bsf - dos]c and [ fig : bsf - dos]d .",
    "before we examine to the quantitative estimates , it is instructive to note the difference in informational content provided by the bsf and dos . in all cases",
    ", the spin - resolved dos indicates that at @xmath20 , @xmath74 , which may lead us to naively assume of a negative spin - polarization , i.e. , @xmath75 . such an estimate is used quite often , even today . in certain cases ,",
    "this estimate can be improved upon if , instead of the total dos , only its @xmath41- and @xmath42-electron projections are considered , but even such improvement can be efficient only when the electron mobility values in both spin channels are close .",
    "in contrast , we see from the bsfs that the electron momentum uncertainties ( @xmath76 ) at @xmath20 produced by disorder are also very different for the two spins ( @xmath77 ) and suggest the opposite conclusion , i.e. , a positive spin - polarization , @xmath78 . obviously , in such situations , a final conclusion can be made only if it is based on approaches adequately accounting for both factors .",
    "for this reason , we compute the spin - projected resistivities as functions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in mn@xmath59ga , mn@xmath53ga and mn@xmath61ga alloys in the following , using the kubo - greenwood linear response formalism  @xcite and applying the relativistic spin - projection scheme  @xcite .",

    "we assume that @xmath37 is oriented along the z - axis because of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy . here , we consider the diagonal elements of the resistivity tensor , @xmath90 , as being responsible for the direct current , @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the external electric field and @xmath94 is the spatial index @xmath95 ) .",

    "this growth is most efficient for small @xmath51 or @xmath52 , and tends to saturate close to @xmath100 ( maximal disorder ) . for the ordered mn@xmath0ga ,",

    "the resistivity spin component trends as functions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 show that @xmath104 grows faster than @xmath105 , which essentially justifies the proposed scheme ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : random_fluctuations_design ] ) .",
    "indeed , both @xmath106 and @xmath107 , as functions of @xmath51 or @xmath52 , evolve towards larger positive values .",

    "is that the disorder influence is stronger for those alloys in which the substituting type ( @xmath30 or @xmath27 ) is further from mn ( e.g. , in terms of the group or valence electrons number ) , i.e. , a larger potential difference leads to a stronger random fluctuation amplitude . indeed , for the types `` closest '' to mn , i.e. , @xmath30 = cr and @xmath27 = fe , the corresponding resistivity components are comparably small ( e.g. , at @xmath111 ) : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115  @xmath116 cm . at the same time , for the types `` most distinct '' from mn , i.e. , @xmath30 = sc and @xmath27 = cu , certain resistivity components are much larger , but not always comparable : @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120  @xmath116 cm .",
    "this simply indicates that , whereas substitution of mn with `` too similar '' elements is not yet appropriately efficient , substitution with `` too distinct '' elements rapidly escapes control , since the band structure is strongly affected not only in the sense of the bloch - wave broadening , but also in the sense of dispersion , @xmath20 position , etc .",
    "the most inefficient situation is observed for mn - cu substitution . here ,",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath104 grow rapidly by achieving large absolute values , but their ratios , and , thus , the spin - polarization , remain unsatisfactorily low .",
    "in contrast , substitution with `` intermediate '' elements , @xmath30 = v , ti , or @xmath27 = co , ni , appears to be very efficient .",

    "regimes this larger resistivity is exhibited by all cu - containing compositions , with a maximum of approximately 140  @xmath116 cm for the mn@xmath70cu@xmath66ga alloy . at the same time , the spin - polarization of metals with large resistivity is always low , since the spin component with higher resistivity can not go far beyond the mooij limit , whereas the other spin component with lower resistivity is already sufficiently high enough . on the other hand , alloys with lower effective resistivities , such as co- or v - containing compositions , exhibit much higher spin - polarization .",
    "interestingly , they show a noticeable `` complementary '' effect , seen for example in the strongly disordered regime ; whereas for both mn@xmath70co@xmath66ga and mn@xmath70v@xmath66ga , @xmath136 , for the combined composition , mn@xmath70v@xmath68co@xmath68ga , it is already 0.81 .",

    ", it is the most constructive in the out - of - plane direction only . at the same time , the constructive effect is achieved immediately , by beginning with a small mn - tm substitution rate .",
    "this is suitable for spintronics elements exploiting magneto - resistance effects , as the unnecessarily high resistance of the electrodes produces unwanted energy losses .",
    "another positive aspect of the presented scheme is the improvement in spin - polarization specifically for the `` current - perpendicular - to - plane '' ( cpp ) setup .",
    "this improvement in combination with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is applicable to many state - of - the - art industrial developments . on the other hand",
    ", this also means that the direct experimental proof of the proposed scheme , at least on a mn@xmath0ga basis , requires preparation of the single - crystalline structures with effective stoichiometric control , which is rather sophisticated . in this respect ,",
    "an interesting future focus is constructive disorder design in cubic systems , as high spin - polarization can be expected in the isotropic case even for polycrystalline materials .",
    "as we have seen , the basic feature which provides the necessary conditions for such disorder engineering , is the presence of two antiparallel magnetic sublattices .",

    "<S> our study highlights spin - polarization mechanisms in metals , by focusing on the mobilities of conducting electrons with different spins instead of their quantities . here , we engineer electron mobility by applying chemical disorder induced by non - stoichiometric variations . as a practical example , we discuss the scheme that establishes such variations in tetragonal mn@xmath0ga heusler material . </S>",
    "<S> we justify this approach using first - principles calculations of the spin - projected conductivity components based on the kubo - greenwood formalism . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that , in majority of the cases , even a small substitution of some other transition element instead of mn may lead to a substantial increase in spin - polarization along the tetragonal axis . </S>"
