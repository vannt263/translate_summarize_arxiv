    "the skyrme model has been applied to the nucleon static properties @xcite and the nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite with reasonable success . in the last few years",
    ", nucleon annihilation has been investigated from the skyrme point of view .",
    "sommermann et al .",
    "@xcite studied the dynamics of ungroomed skyrmion - antiskyrmion ( @xmath2 ) collisions .",
    "they found that annihilation proceeds quickly with the creation of a coherent pion pulse .",
    "this was confirmed by shao , walet and amado @xcite .",
    "the notion that annihilation leads to an intense coherent pion field burst gives reason for considering annihilation within the classical skyrme approach .",
    "the idea , that the annihilation products , pion and other mesons , come from a coherent wave of meson fields arising from soliton - antisoliton dynamics , turns out to be very fruitful @xcite .",
    "experimental data such as annihilation branching ratios among meson types and pion charge types from low energy annihilation are well explained with minimal parameters@xcite .",
    "furthermore this picture provides a unified view of annihilation in which all the channels come from a single process .",
    "previous studies of annihilation in the skyrme context , with the exception of @xcite , have concentrated on the final state mesons . a full account of the process requires a description of the initial state nucleon - antinucleon interaction and of the dynamics leading up to annihilation as well .",
    "in this paper , as a first step in that directions , we extend the application of the skyrme model to the interaction of @xmath3 in the product ansatz .",
    "( we note that the energy of @xmath2 in the product ansatz was studied for two configurations by musakhanov and musatov @xcite . )",
    "phenomenologically , the @xmath3 potential is not as well established as the @xmath4 potential . at distances",
    "less than one fermi , the interaction is dominated by annihilation . however , at larger distances , a meaningful potential can be defined and studied either by @xmath5-transformation on the @xmath4 meson exchange potential or phenomenologically . here",
    "we will compare our skyrme model results to this phenomenology .",
    "we will see that at large distance , where the product ansatz makes the best sense , the potentials we find agree qualitatively and , in most cases , quantitatively with phenomenological interactions . at intermediate and short distances , we do less well , but at these distances the product ansatz is not valid .",
    "however it is still suggestive . to obtain the interaction at intermediate distances , we would need to study the full skyrme dynamics at these distances .",
    "for the static @xmath2 this is somewhat more complex than in the corresponding @xmath6 case studied by walhout and wambach , , but is possible and we plan to return to it .",
    "the full , time dependent , dynamical @xmath2 problem is far more difficult than the @xmath6 case and is plagued for @xmath2 by numerical instabilities @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons , and because this paper is a first step , we begin by exploring the interaction in the product ansatz . in order to carry out our study",
    "it is necessary to include @xmath7 and @xmath8 mixing in the potential as was first suggested in the @xmath4 case @xcite .    in the context of the product ansatz",
    ", we find that the ungroomed @xmath2 channel studied in @xcite is the most attractive channel and that it leads to rapid annihilation . for non - zero grooming",
    ", we find that the @xmath2 interaction can be repulsive .",
    "therefore it seems likely that the dynamics in groomed channels could be very different from that exhibited in @xcite",
    ". since the physical nucleon is represented by an average over differently groomed skyrmions , annihilation in the nucleon - antinucleon system may proceed more slowly than that of ungroomed @xmath2 .    in sec .  2 we study the interaction energy of @xmath2 as a function of separation and relative grooming in the product ansatz .",
    "we start by studying the very simplified case of skyrmion and groomed antiskyrmion on top of each other .",
    "this is a physically artificial case , but it permits analytic evaluation and teaches us something , albeit qualitative , about the dependence of the @xmath2 interaction on grooming . we find that for zero separation and zero grooming , the @xmath2 system has zero total energy , as we expect .",
    "this is the case of complete annihilation .",
    "however at relative grooming angle of @xmath9 , and still zero separation , the product ansatz gives a total energy for the @xmath2 system of four times the single skyrmion energy , corresponding to a very repulsive interaction .",
    "this clearly indicates that the @xmath2 interaction is a strong function of relative grooming .",
    "next we study , always in the product ansatz , the interaction energy of @xmath2 at non - zero separation as a function of grooming .",
    "we project to the nucleon space by the algebraic methods of @xcite which also include finite @xmath0 corrections . in sec .",
    "3 we consider the effects of rotational excitations by including intermediate states with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we first evaluate the corrections to the @xmath3 potential in perturbation theory and then study the effect fully by diagonalizing in the space spanned by @xmath10 , @xmath7 and corresponding antiparticles .",
    "our results are presented in sec .",
    "we calculate the energy of the skyrmion and antiskyrmion system using the skyrme lagrangian .",
    "the density of this lagrangian is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a unitary @xmath1 valued field and @xmath15.\\ ] ] the first term in the lagrangian comes from the non - linear @xmath16-model and the second is the skyrme term .",
    "the third term is a pion mass term and we take @xmath17 mev .",
    "we take the parameters in the lagrangian to have the values @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 .",
    "these values guarantee that the long distance tail of the nucleon - antinucleon interaction will agree with phenomenology , by virtue of the goldberger - treiman relation .",
    "we begin by studying the energy in the product ansatz for the case of zero separation .",
    "we include the first two terms in the lagrangian . the mass term is neglected since it does not lead to additional understanding of this simple configuration .",
    "let @xmath20 be the ungroomed skyrme @xmath1 field .",
    "the ungroomed @xmath12 would be @xmath21 .",

    "after some algebra , we arrive at the following result for the total energy of the @xmath2 product ansatz at relative grooming angle @xmath24 and zero separation .",
    "@xmath38 for the profile @xmath33 which minimizes the @xmath34 skyrme mass , we have @xmath39 from scaling arguments . here",

    "of course for @xmath27 or @xmath44 , the total energy is zero .",
    "this shows that , even for the artificial case of zero separation , the @xmath2 energy is very dependent on grooming .",
    "we now study , in the product ansatz , the energy of the @xmath2 system as a function of the separation and relative grooming .",
    "this can only be done numerically .",
    "we now use the full lagrangian including the finite pion mass term .",

    "[ fig.2 ] . recall that the separation is along the @xmath46 axis .",

    "the @xmath46-@xmath9 grooming , while being the most repulsive for @xmath6 , is mildly attractive for @xmath2 .",
    "finally the ungroomed case is the most attractive for @xmath2 while it is mildly repulsive for @xmath6 .",
    "this also leads to speculation about the speed the speed of annihilation . in the calculation of @xcite ,",
    "the starting configuration is ungroomed and annihilation happens very fast .",
    "this may reflect the fact that this is the the most attractive channel .",
    "the physical nucleon is a linear superposition of groomed skyrmions and perhaps in this case annihilation will proceed slower than that seen in @xcite .",
    "we now turn to an expansion of the energy in the relative grooming variables as a first step in obtaining the projection of the @xmath2 interaction onto the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "we follow the methods developed for obtaining the @xmath4 interaction from the @xmath6 .",
    "as in the calculation of @xcite for @xmath6 , the energy for @xmath2 can be expanded in the variables @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with the relative grooming matrix @xmath58 and @xmath59 the vector connecting the centers of the two solitons . for the @xmath6 , the full expansion is @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 are functions of @xmath45 . for @xmath2 , the symmetry of @xmath63",
    "is broken by the product ansatz and we need three additional terms for a consistent expansion @xmath64 these terms odd in @xmath59 are an artifact of the asymmetry of the product ansatz and should be discarded .",
    "one can use the symmetrized energy @xmath65 to extract @xmath66 to @xmath67 , since the @xmath68 to @xmath69 terms drop out in this combination .",
    "the six terms in ( 11 ) can be expressed in terms of operators in the baryon space using the algebraic methods introduced in @xcite .",
    "one quantizes each skyrmion with a @xmath70 algebra and then the relevant operators and baryon states are easily constructed in terms of the operators of those algebras .",
    "the method was developed in @xcite for the @xmath4 system , but since each skyrmion gets its own algebra , the method can be taken over without alteration to the @xmath3 system .",

    "the advantage of the algebraic method is it allows us to study both the large @xmath0 limit , and to include finite @xmath0 effects explicitly in a systematic way .",
    "it also makes taking baryon matrix elements quite easy . as in the @xmath6 case ,",
    "we find for @xmath2 that the terms quadratic in @xmath72 and @xmath71 are quite small , and so we neglect them . hence we can write @xmath79    we can use the algebraic methods of @xcite to take the @xmath3 matrix element of our interaction . keeping only the leading terms",

    "this is a crucial part of the @xmath4 interaction , but the corresponding @xmath2 distortion is beyond the scope of this paper . for the @xmath4 system",
    "this distortion , coupled with the state mixing , is crucial for getting the mid - range attraction .",
    "for the nucleon- antinucleon system we expect similar enhancements of attraction coming from the distortion .",
    "the effects of distortion and state mixing both come in at distances where the product ansatz can be expected to fail . thus our short and mid - range results with the product ansatz , even including state mixing ,",
    "should be taken as only indicative and not as the final word .",

    "these are potentials based on meson exchange at large distances and phenomenology , including an absorptive part to model annihilation , at small distances .",
    "the meson exchange part of these potentials for @xmath3 is obtained from the corresponding @xmath4 potentials by @xmath5-parity transform  the contribution of a particular meson for @xmath3 is equal to its part in @xmath132 multiplied by the meson s @xmath5-parity .",

    "the spin - orbit force is of higher order in @xmath94 and we have not calculated it in the skyrme picture .",
    "we should note that various cutoffs are used in the brian - phillips , nijmegen and other similar potentials . as a result at distance 1 fm or less the strength of the potentials",
    "can be significantly different from their meson exchange value .",
    "in addition , at distance less than 1 fm , the interaction is dominated by the absorptive potential of order 1 gev .",
    "furthermore , at these short distances the entire static skyrme approach , to say nothing of the product ansatz , is no longer meaningful .",
    "hence we should not place any faith on comparisons of our results with the phenomenological potentials around 1 fm or less . at intermediate distances , between 1 fm and 2 fm",
    ", the results from our skyrme approach to the @xmath4 interaction suggest that the product ansatz is on the right track , but that careful comparison with phenomenological potentials requires a more complete calculation of the skyrme dynamics . in particular we expect the product ansatz to underestimate mid - range attraction , as it does for @xmath4 .",
    "this is basically a consequence of the variational theorem . with these thoughts in mind",
    ", let us turn to our results .",
    "figure 3 shows our results for the @xmath106 part of the central potential .",
    "we see that the effects of @xmath7 mixing either in perturbation theory or full born - oppenheimer diagonalization is significant , but still does not begin to agree with the strong central , mid - range attraction seen in the phenomenological potentials .",

    ". it will be important to see if complete skyrme calculations can repair this fault .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath128 central potential . here",
    "the effects of @xmath7 mixing are more striking since for @xmath128 single @xmath7 intermediate states are permitted .",
    "now we do find some central attraction , but not as much as is seen phenomenologically .",
    "note that where they differ , the full diagonalization result has superior credentials to the perturbation theory result , and it is the diagonalization result that is too weak .",
    "again we must await full skyrme calculation in this channel .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath106 spin - spin part of the interaction . except at the smallest distances ,",
    "the results are very satisfactory .",
    "note that this is remarkable , since the spin - spin interaction is very weak ( note the scale in figure 5 ) , and hence arises from cancellation of much larger terms .",
    "we believe it is significant that the skyrme picture can reproduce this scale and even the correct sign .",
    "the effects of cancellations are even more striking in figure 6 which shows the @xmath128 spin - spin interaction . again",
    "the order of magnitudes are correct while the sign depends sensitively on how we do the @xmath7 mixing .",
    "note that the phenomenological potentials are consistent with zero .",
    "finally in figures 7 and 8 we show the @xmath106 and @xmath128 tensor potentials .",
    "all calculations of these agree since they are dominated by one - pion exchange .",
    "( recall that the skyrme picture in the product ansatz gets one pion exchange right . )",
    "hence except for the central attraction , the product ansatz gives a credible account of the nucleon - antinucleon potential , and we understand how the product ansatz fails for the central attraction .",
    "note that there are no free parameters on our calculation .",
    "we have shown that the skyrme picture with the product ansatz is a reasonable first step to obtaining the real part of the nucleon - antinucleon interaction .",
    "we also understand how doing the skyrme dynamics better can repair the lack of central attraction we find here . hence the next step is to do that dynamics . then combing this picture of nucleon - antinucleon interactions in the entrance channel based on the skyrme model with our previous work on annihilation channels described by this model , we hope to have a unified picture of annihilation based on the large @xmath0 , qcd inspired skyrme picture .",
