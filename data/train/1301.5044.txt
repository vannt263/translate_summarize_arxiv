    "leveraging feedback to obtain the channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) enables a wireless system to adapt its transmission strategy to the varying wireless environment .",
    "the growing number of wireless users , as well as their increasing demands for higher data rate services impose a significant burden on the feedback link . in particular for ofdma systems , which have emerged as the core technology in 4 g and future wireless systems , full csit feedback may become prohibitive because of the large number of resource blocks .",
    "this motivates more efficient feedback design approaches in order to achieve performance comparable to a full csit system with reduced feedback . in the recent years , considerable",
    "work and effort has been focused on limited or partial feedback design , e.g. , see @xcite and the references therein . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "most of the existing partial feedback designs are homogeneous , i.e. , users feedback consumptions do not adapt to the underlying channel statistics . in this paper , we propose and analyze a heterogeneous feedback design , which aligns users feedback needs to the statistical properties of their wireless environments .",
    "current homogeneous feedback design in ofdma systems groups the resource blocks into subband @xcite which forms the basic scheduling and feedback unit . since the subband granularity is determined by the frequency selectivity , or the coherence bandwidth of the underlying channel",
    ", it would be beneficial to adjust the subband size of different users according to their channel statistics .",
    "empirical measurements and analysis from the channel modeling field have shown that the root mean square ( rms ) delay spread which is closely related to the coherence bandwidth , is both location and environment dependent @xcite .",
    "the typical rms delay spread for an indoor environment in wlan does not exceed hundreds of nanoseconds ; whereas in the outdoor environment of a cellular system , it can be up to several microseconds . intuitively , users with lower rms delay spread could model their channel with a larger subband size and require less feedback resource than the users with higher rms delay spread .",
    "herein , we investigate this heterogeneous feedback design in a multiuser opportunistic scheduling framework where the system favors the user with the best channel condition to exploit multiuser diversity @xcite .",
    "there are two major existing partial feedback strategies for opportunistic scheduling , one is based on thresholding where each user provides one bit of feedback per subband to indicate whether or not the particular channel gain exceeds a predetermined or optimized threshold @xcite . the other promising strategy currently considered in practical systems such as lte @xcite is the best - m strategy , where the receivers order and convey the m best channels @xcite . the best - m partial feedback strategy is embedded in the proposed heterogeneous feedback framework .",
    "apart from the requirement of partial feedback to save feedback resource , the study of imperfections is also important to understand the effect of channel estimation error and feedback delay on the heterogeneous feedback framework .",
    "these imperfections are also considered in our work .",
    "an important step towards heterogeneous feedback design is leveraging the  match \" among coherence bandwidth , subband size and partial feedback . under a given amount of partial feedback , if the subband size is much larger than the coherence bandwidth , then multiple independent channels could exist within a subband and the subband - based feedback could only be a coarse representative of the channels . on the other hand , if the subband size is much smaller than the coherence bandwidth , then channels in adjacent subbands are likely to be highly correlated and requiring feedback on adjacent subbands",
    "could be a waste of resource ; or a small amount of subband - based partial feedback may not be enough to reflect the channel quality . in order to support this heterogeneous framework",
    ", we first consider the scenario of a general correlated channel model with one cluster of users with the same coherence bandwidth .",
    "the subband size is adjustable and each user employs the best - m partial feedback strategy to convey the m best channel quality information ( cqi ) which is defined to be the subband average rate .",
    "the simulation result shows that a suitable chosen subband size yields higher average sum rate under partial feedback conforming the aforementioned intuition .",
    "this motivates the design of heterogeneous feedback to  match \" the subband size to the coherence bandwidth . the above - mentioned study , though closely reflects the relevant mechanism , is not analytically tractable due to two main reasons .",
    "firstly , the general correlated channel model complicates the statistical analysis of the cqi .",
    "secondly , the use of subband average rate as cqi makes it difficult to analyze the multi - cluster scenario .",
    "therefore , a simplified generic channel model is needed that balances the competing needs of analytical tractability and practical relevance .    in order to facilitate analysis ,",
    "a subband fading channel model is developed that generalizes the widely used frequency domain block fading channel model .",
    "the subband fading model is suited for the multi - cluster analysis . according to the subband fading model , the channel frequency selectivity is flat within each subband , and independent across subbands .",
    "since the subband sizes are different across different clusters , the number of independent channels are heterogeneous across clusters and this yields heterogeneous partial feedback design .",
    "another benefit of the subband fading model is that the cqi becomes the channel gain and thus facilitate further statistical analysis . under the multi - cluster subband fading model and the assumption of perfect feedback ,",
    "we derive a closed form expression for the average sum rate . additionally , we approximate the sum rate ratio for heterogeneous design , i.e. , the ratio of the average sum rate obtained by a partial feedback scheme to that achieved by a full feedback scheme , in order to choose different best - m for users with different coherence bandwidth .",
    "we also compare and demonstrate the potential of the proposed heterogeneous feedback design against the homogeneous case under the same feedback constraint in our simulation study .",
    "the average sum rate helps in understanding the system performance with perfect feedback . in practical feedback systems ,",
    "imperfections occur such as channel estimation error and feedback delay .",
    "these inevitable factors degrade the system performance by causing outage @xcite .",
    "therefore , rather than using average sum rate as the performance metric , we employ the notion of average goodput @xcite to incorporate outage probability . under the multi - cluster subband fading model , we perform analysis on the average goodput and the average outage probability with heterogeneous partial feedback .",
    "in addition to examining the impact of imperfect feedback on multiuser diversity @xcite , we also investigate how to adapt and optimize the average goodput in the presence of these imperfections .",
    "we consider both the fixed rate and the variable rate scenarios , and utilize bounding technique and an efficient approximation to derive near - optimal strategies .    to summarize , the contributions of this paper are threefold : a conceptual heterogeneous feedback design framework to adapt feedback amount to the underlying channel statistics , a thorough analysis of both perfect and imperfect feedback systems under the multi - cluster subband fading model , and the development of approximations and near - optimal approaches to adapt and optimize the system performance .",

    "only fast fading effect is considered in this paper , i.e. , the effects of path loss and shadowing are assumed to be ideally compensated by power control .",

    "the channels at different subcarriers are correlated , and the correlation coefficient between subcarriers @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be described as follows : @xmath20    in general , adjacent subcarriers are highly correlated . in order to reduce feedback needs ,",
    "@xmath21 subcarriers are formed as one resource block , and @xmath22 resource blocks are grouped into one subband .",
    "thus , there are @xmath23 resource blocks and @xmath24 subbands . in this manner",
    ", each user performs subband - based feedback to enable opportunistic scheduling at the transmitter .",
    "since the channels are correlated and there is one cqi to represent a given subband , the cqi is a function of the all the individual channels within that subband .",

    "after the base station receives feedback , it performs opportunistic scheduling and selects the user @xmath3 for transmission at subband @xmath26 if user @xmath3 has the largest cqi at subband @xmath26 .",

    ", @xmath48 matches the frequency selectivity and there would be performance loss or waste of feedback resource when a subband size is blindly chosen . in a multi - cluster scenario where users in different clusters experience diverse coherence bandwidth , this advocates heterogeneous subband size and heterogeneous feedback .    the general correlated channel model as well as",
    "the non - linearity of the cqi , though useful to demonstrate the need for heterogeneous feedback , does not lend itself to tractable statistical analysis . to develop a tractable analytical framework ,",

    "however , in our heterogeneous partial feedback framework , since the number of independent cqi for cluster @xmath53 is @xmath61 , a fair and reasonable way to allocate the feedback resource is to linearly scale the feedback amount for users in cluster @xmath53 . to be specific , user @xmath3 in @xmath72 ( i.e. , the cluster with the largest subband size ) is assumed to feed back the @xmath28 best cqi selected from @xmath73 , whereas user @xmath3 in @xmath53 conveys the @xmath74 best cqi selected from @xmath75 . after receiving feedback from all the clusters , for each resource block the system schedules the user for transmission with the largest cqi .",
