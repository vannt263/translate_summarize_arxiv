    "theoretical and experimental studies of collective vibrational states built on the superdeformed ( sd ) yrast band are open topics of interest in the field of high - spin nuclear structure .",
    "since the large deformation and rapid rotation of sd bands may produce a novel shell structure , we expect that surface vibrations will exhibit quite different features from those found in spherical and normal - deformed nuclei . according to our previous work@xcite , low - lying octupole vibrations are more important than quadrupole vibrations when the nuclear shape is superdeformed .",
    "strong octupole correlations in sd states have been also suggested theoretically in refs.@xcite .",
    "experimentally , octupole correlations in sd states have been suggested for @xmath5dy@xcite , @xmath6hg@xcite and @xmath0hg@xcite .",
    "we have reported theoretical calculations corresponding to these data for @xmath6hg@xcite and @xmath5dy@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the quadrupole and octupole correlations for @xmath0hg  ( which have been partially reported in refs.@xcite ) and for the neighboring sd nuclei @xmath7hg .",
    "we have predicted the low - lying @xmath3 octupole vibrations for sd hg isotopes @xmath8hg ( @xmath9mev)@xcite .",
    "these predictions differ from the results of generator - coordinate - method ( gcm ) calculations@xcite in which the @xmath10 octupole state is predicted to be the lowest in sd @xmath1hg  and the excitation energies are significantly higher ( @xmath11mev ) than in our predictions .",
    "experimentally @xcite , the routhians of the lowest octupole state decrease with the rotational frequency , for example from @xmath12mev to 0.3mev as @xmath13 goes from 0.25 to 0.35mev , therefore to compare the theoretical routhians directly with the experimental ones , we need to calculate them at finite rotational frequency . for this purpose ,",
    "the cranked shell model extended by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) provides us with a powerful tool to investigate collective excitations at high angular momentum .",
    "a great advantage of this model is its ability to take into account effects of the coriolis coupling on the collective vibrational motions in a rapidly rotating system . since in the normal - deformed nuclei",
    "it is known that coriolis coupling effects are important even for the @xmath14 octupole states@xcite , one may expect strong coriolis mixing for high - spin octupole states built on the sd yrast band . on the other hand ,",
    "our previous calculations suggested weak coriolis mixing for the lowest octupole state in @xmath1hg@xcite and @xmath5dy@xcite .",
    "this may be because the angular momentum of the octupole phonon is strongly coupled to the symmetry axis due to the large deformation of the sd shape .",
    "generally speaking , coriolis mixing is expected to occur more easily in nuclei with smaller deformation .",
    "however this expectation may not hold for octupole bands in all sd nuclei because coriolis mixing depends on the shell structure . in this paper",
    "we find a significant difference in the coriolis mixing between an octupole band in @xmath0hg  and the other bands .",
    "another advantage of this model is that it gives us a unified microscopic description of collective states , weakly - collective states , and non - collective two - quasiparticle excitations .",
    "a transition of the octupole vibrations into aligned two - quasiparticle bands at high - spin in normal - deformed nuclei has been predicted by vogel@xcite . in ref.@xcite , this transition is discussed in the context of experimental data on rare - earth and actinide nuclei , and a damping of octupole collectivity at high spin was suggested . since similar phenomena may happen to octupole vibrations in sd states , it is important that our model describes the interplay between collective and non - collective excitations .",
    "recent experimental studies reveal a number of interesting features of excited sd bands in even - even hg isotopes . in @xmath0hg , almost constant dynamic moments of inertia @xmath15 have been observed by crowell et al.@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite has established the relative excitation energy of this band and confirmed the dipole character of the decay transitions into the yrast sd band .",
    "this band has been interpreted as an octupole vibrational band .",

    "have reported two excited bands which exhibit peaks in @xmath15 at high frequency .",
    "in contrast with these atypical @xmath15 behaviors , two excited bands in @xmath2hg  originally observed by riley et al.@xcite and extended by cederwall et al.@xcite show a smooth increase with rotational frequency .",
    "we show in this paper that this @xmath15 behavior can be explained with a single theoretical model which microscopically takes into account shape vibrations and the coriolis force .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the rpa method based on the cranked shell model and its ability to describe a variety of nuclear properties including shape vibration at large deformation and high spin .",
    "we propose a plausible interpretation for the microscopic structure of excited sd bands in @xmath8hg , and show that octupole bands may be more prevalent than expected in these sd nuclei . section [ sec : model ] presents a description of the model , in which we stress our improvements to the cranked nilsson potential and to the coupled rpa method in a rotating system .",

    "the theory of the cranked shell model extended by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) was first developed by marshalek@xcite and has been applied to high - spin @xmath16 and @xmath4 vibrational bands@xcite and to octupole bands@xcite . since this theory is suitable for describing the collective vibrations built on deformed high - spin states , it is very useful for investigating vibrational motion built on the sd yrast band .",
    "we start with a rotating mean field with a rotational frequency @xmath17 described by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a standard nilsson potential defined in single - stretched coordinates , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",

    "this problem comes from the spurious velocity - dependence associated with the @xmath29-term in the nilsson potential which is absent for woods - saxon .",
    "if the mean - field potential is velocity independent , the local velocity distribution in the rotating nucleus remains isotropic in velocity space , which means that the flow pattern becomes the same as for a rigid - body rotation@xcite .",
    "however , in the cranked nilsson potential , this isotropy of the velocity distribution is significantly broken due to the @xmath29-term .",
    "thus the coriolis force introduces a spurious flow in the rotating coordinate system , proportional to the rotational frequency .",
    "this spurious effect can be compensated by an additional term that restores the local galilean invariance .",

    "the @xmath41 and @xmath15 values calculated with the additional term are very close to the rigid - body value at low frequency , which means that the spurious effects of the @xmath45-term have been removed .",

    "all multipole operators are defined in doubly - stretched coordinates , ( @xmath56 ) , which can be regarded as an improved version of the conventional multipole interaction .",
    "sakamoto and kishimoto@xcite have shown that at the limit of the harmonic - oscillator potential ( at @xmath57 ) , it guarantees nuclear self - consistency@xcite , restoration of the symmetry broken in the mean field , and separation of the spurious solutions .",

    "the increase in @xmath15 for the yrast sd band is partially attributed to the alignment of these high-@xmath203 intruder orbits and , since the blocking effect of the quasiparticles prevents any alignment due to band crossings involving these orbits , the lack of alignment should produce an @xmath15 curve quite different from those of the yrast sd band .",

    "the @xmath4 vibrations are calculated to be much higher and crossed by several two - quasiparticle bands ( fig .",

    "to clarify the reason for this @xmath220 enhancement in this particular band , we display the @xmath172 amplitudes ( @xmath10 , 1 , 2 and 3 ) of these octupole states as functions of frequency in fig .",
