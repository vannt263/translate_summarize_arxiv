    "two original proposals exist in the literature , which have been widely studied :    * monopoles@xcite .",

    "on the other hand we shall see that @xmath106 contains all the relevant information as @xmath60 , and also in a more convenient way . from @xmath106 , @xmath60 is obtained as @xmath107 \\label{eq25}\\ ] ] since @xmath108 .",

    "measuring instead @xmath106 and checking numerically the behavior eq.(31 ) amounts to state that @xmath60 is exactly zero in the thermodynamical limit . in the critical region , around @xmath31 one expects @xmath116 with @xmath117 , @xmath118 a critical index , @xmath17 the lattice spacing and @xmath119 the correlation length .",
    "the transition is known to be second order for @xmath39 , weak first order for @xmath42 gauge theory , and therefore @xmath120 goes large at small @xmath121 s . neglecting @xmath122 and trading the variable @xmath123 with @xmath124 , the scaling law follows for @xmath106 from eq.(32 ) @xmath125 for different sizes of the lattice @xmath126 , when plotted versus @xmath124 is expected to be independent of @xmath110 .",
    "a best fit to the data@xcite allows a determination of @xmath127 .",

    "a few different abelian projections have been tested , and the behavior of @xmath106 , as well as the value of @xmath38 and @xmath118 are independent of the abelian projection . an additional test has been made with no abelian projection , i.e. by assuming as diagonal operators the nominal @xmath129 used in the simulation@xcite .",
    "this amounts to perform an average over all abelian projections , and the result does not change .",
    "we can thus state that the confining phase of a pure gauge theory is a dual superconductor in all the abelian projections , and undergoes a transition to normal at @xmath31 .",
    "what we learn from that is that , whatever the dual excitations are , they carry magnetic charge in all the abelian projections . the definition of the operator @xmath55 can be easily extended to full qcd , with dynamical quarks .",
    "a natural question is whether also in this case the confining phase is characterized by dual superconductivity",
    ". this would indeed be the expectation in the spirit of the @xmath130 limit .",
    "if the physics of gauge theories is determined by the limit @xmath130 at @xmath131 fixed , corrections @xmath132 being small , then the mechanism of confinement has to be @xmath133 independent , and also insensitive to the presence of dynamical quarks , their contribution being non leading in the @xmath132 expansion .",
    "the parameter @xmath134 should go to @xmath113 for @xmath35 in the thermodynamical limit so that @xmath135 : this is indeed the case @xcite . for @xmath32 @xmath106",
    "converges to a finite limit , i.e. @xmath136 and there is superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the shaded area of fig.1 does indeed correspond to a superconductor , the upper area to a superselected magnetic system : the negative peak is at the transition as defined in sect.2 [ fig.7 ]    .",
    "the peak of @xmath106 coincides with the drop of @xmath137.,width=302 ]    around @xmath31 a finite size scaling analysis can give information on the order of the transition : the difference with respect to the quenched case is that now an extra dimensionful quantity , the quark mass , enters and there is a two variable scaling . as usual",
    "we expect @xmath138 in the critical regime @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath120 and we can again trade @xmath141 with @xmath124 , and the scaling law becomes @xmath142 the index @xmath143 is known : one can chose for different values of @xmath110 suitable quark masses , so as to keep @xmath144 fixed .",
    "the scaling law is then the same as eq ( 28 ) , whence the index @xmath38 can be extracted and with it information on the order of the transition .",
    "this is a heavy numerical program which is on the way on our ape machines .",
    "the result will possibly be relevant to the problems discussed in sect 2 .",
    "* confinement is characterized by dual superconductivity of the vacuum in all the abelian projections , both in quenched and in full qcd , in line with the idea of the limit @xmath130 .",
