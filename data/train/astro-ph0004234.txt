    "core - collapse supernovae mark the death of a massive star and the birth of a compact remnant .",
    "theory suggests that the remnant can be either a neutron star or a black hole , depending on the character of the progenitor and the details of the explosion .",
    "radio pulsar emission has allowed to compile a variety of observational evidence associating neutron stars with sites of known supernovae , but similar evidence for a black hole - supernova connection is still mostly unavailable .",
    "interestingly , indirect evidence that the black hole candidate in the x - ray binary system gro j1655 - 40 was formed in a supernova explosion has recently been reported by @xcite .",
    "the inference is based on detection of high abundances of nitrogen and oxygen on the surface of the companion , which has too low a mass to have produced them by thermonuclear burning , hence indicating that they were deposited there by the supernova that created the black hole .",
    "the formation of a compact object in a supernova can be inferred _ directly _ if the object causes an observable effect on the total luminosity which follows the explosion ",
    "i.e. , the _ light curve_. in particular , some material from the base of the expanding envelope may remain bound to the compact object and continuously fall back onto it , thus generating an accretion luminosity .",
    "@xcite have recently performed a self - consistent investigation of the accretion luminosity generated by spherically symmetric `` fallback '' of matter onto a black hole in the wake of a supernova . with the aid of a general - relativistic , radiation hydrodynamic lagrangian code they showed",
    "that , at late times , the fallback evolves quasi - stationarily with the accretion luminosity obeying the analytic expression found by @xcite for steady state , spherical hypercritical accretion that largely exceeds the eddington limit for the accreting object , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "the actual luminosity that arises would still be sub - eddington if the efficiency of converting energy into radiative luminosity is low enough . ] .",
    "the accretion luminosity declines secularly with a time dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "this decay is driven by the decrease in the accretion rate due to the continuous expansion of the supernova envelope ( colpi , shapiro & wasserman 1996 ) ,    such an accretion luminosity will produce a distinct signature on the total light curve if and when it becomes comparable to the output of other power sources , namely the initial internal energy of the envelope and decays of radioactive isotopes synthesized in the explosion .",
    "it is well established that the efficiency of converting spherical accretion onto a black hole into radiative luminosity may be quite low ( shapiro 1973 ; blondin 1986 ; wandel , yahil & milgrom 1986 ; park 1990 ; nobili , turolla & zampieri 1991 ; zampieri , miller & turolla 1996 ) , and , in general , the accretion luminosity will be undetectable in comparison with the luminosity generated by radioactive decays .",
    "this is particularly important when compared to the case of accretion onto a neutron star , which is expected to be far more efficient in generating an accretion luminosity . for the last decade",
    "this distinction has been specifically applied to the case of sn1987a : @xcite and @xcite found that accretion onto a newly formed neutron star in sn1987a would generate an accretion luminosity at the eddington - rate ( @xmath7ergs@xmath3 ) within a few months after the explosion , and the luminosity would persist at this rate for several years .",
    "the proximity of sn1987a has allowed observations to follow the light curve for over 3000 days ( to a present luminosity of @xmath8ergs@xmath3 ) , and the light curve has been completely consistent with heating by decays of @xmath1 , @xmath9and @xmath10 .",
    "the absence of any evidence for accretion luminosity in the case of sn1987a has been used to argue that the compact remnant in sn1987a is a low mass black hole , implying significant consequences regarding the nuclear equation of state @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued , however , that this absence could still be consistent with a weakly magnetized neutron star , if the accretion flow has become dynamically unstable ( fryer , colgate & pinto 1999 ) .",
    "a positive indication of the presence of a black hole would be an actual detection of the accretion luminosity .",
    "the power - law time dependence would make the accretion luminosity easily discernible from luminosity generated by radioactive heating , which decreases exponentially with time .",
    "furthermore , the difference in the time dependence implies that the accretion luminosity _ must _ eventually become dominant over radioactive decays , so in principle , the black hole always `` emerges '' in supernovae light curves .",
    "however , the potential for observation is usually quite slim : for example , @xcite estimated that if a low mass black hole was formed in sn1987a , the accretion luminosity will not become dominant over that of heating by @xmath10decays until @xmath11 years after the explosion , when the luminosity will have dropped to a mere @xmath12ergs@xmath3 .",
    "the abundance of radioactive elements and the amount of fallback in sn1987a are rather typical of core collapse supernovae of low to intermediate mass progenitors ( 1225 @xmath13 ) so that , if a black hole is formed , the `` emergence '' of the accretion luminosity occurs only at such late times and low luminosities that it is of no observational consequence .",
    "an important exception may exist , however , in the explosions of more massive stars . in their survey of supernova explosions and nucleosynthesis",
    ", @xcite find that more massive stars tend to produce more massive compact remnants : the original iron core is larger , leading to a more massive proto - neutron star and to larger amounts of fallback ( see also fryer 1999 ) .",
    "correspondingly , larger mass progenitors are more likely to produce black holes ( as the remnant mass would be larger than the maximum mass of stable neutron stars ) , and to have larger amounts of material that remain bound to the black hole as a reservoir for late time fallback .",
    "just as important , the final abundance of the key radioactive isotopes ( @xmath14 , @xmath15ni and @xmath10 ) in the expanding envelope is quite sensitive to the location of the cutoff that defines the material which settles on the black hole during the early stages ( while the explosion is still proceeding ) . for the more massive progenitors",
    "the cutoff is further out , and since the radioactive elements are synthesized in the innermost layers above the proto - neutron star , the total mass of these elements in the ejected envelopes of higher mass stars can be significantly smaller than in `` standard '' supernovae .",
    "in fact , progenitor of masses in the range @xmath16 , are expected to be practically free of radioactive elements that can power the bolometric light curve @xcite .",
    "for such stars , black hole accretion luminosity should emerge immediately after the decay of the recombination peak ( tens of days after the explosions ) , while it is still relatively powerful , and hence potentially observable .    naturally , the more massive stars are a small minority in the stellar population , as are their explosions among core collapse supernovae",
    ". however , one recent supernova , sn1997d in ngc 1536 @xcite , may present a border - line candidate for a direct detection of black hole emergence .",
    "its observed light curve indicates that that the total mass of @xmath1(the daughter of @xmath14 ) in the envelope is only @xmath17 , a factor of @xmath18 lower than sn1987a . by analyzing the light curve and spectra ,",
    "@xcite suggested that sn1997d was a low energy ( @xmath19ergs ) explosion of a @xmath20 star .",
    "the expected mass of the remnant is about @xmath21 ( formed by a @xmath22 early fallback on a @xmath23 collapsed core ) , hence most likely a black hole .",
    "based on the inferred average properties of the material available for late time fallback and on the late time behavior of the accretion luminosity found by @xcite , zampieri , shapiro & colpi ( 1998b ) estimated that accretion luminosity will emerge in sn1997d in the optical band within _ only a few years _ after the explosion .    in this work",
    "we revisit the issue of black hole emergence in supernova due to spherically - symmetric late - time accretion .",
    "in particular , we investigate a more robust estimate for our `` proto - type '' case , sn1997d .",
    "we furnish revised analytic estimates and a detailed numerical investigation of the radiation - hydrodynamic evolution of the ejecta , incorporating the effects of a realistic chemical composition , opacities and radioactive heating on the accretion history and luminosity .",
    "the numerical study is based on an improved version of the radiation - hydrodynamic code used by @xcite , where the main modifications are the inclusion of realistic envelope composition and opacities ( rather than pure hydrogen ) and of heating by radioactive decays .",
    "we find that a @xmath21 black hole should emerge in the sn1997d light curve at about 1000 - 1500 days after the explosion ",
    "i.e. , _ during late 1999 and 2000 _  when the total bolometric luminosity is @xmath24ergs@xmath3 , and is marginally detectable with hst .",
    "in the course of our computational study we were compelled to introduce a rescaling scheme in order to numerically follow the accretion history and light curve for several years .",
    "the huge dynamical range of pertinent time scales renders a full scale time - integration numerically impractical .",
    "our solution has been to study a scaled model which evolves more quickly and allows a simple relation between the properties and history of the rescaled model and the true one .",
    "we note that this scheme , which is presented in detail in the appendix , is potentially suitable for other problems which involve time - dependent radiation hydrodynamics spanning a large dynamic range .",
    "we begin our discussion in   [ sect : basics ] with a summary of the characteristic features of supernova light curve evolution when accretion onto a central black hole is occurring .",
    "quantitative relations between the light curve magnitude and the relevant time scales are also reviewed .",
    "the principal features of the numerical code of @xcite and the modifications incorporated for this work are described in   [ sect : code ] .",
    "the light curve of sn1997d is examined in detail in   [ sect : sn1997d ] , where we present analytic and numerical results , including our estimates regarding black hole emergence .",
    "prospects of observing black hole emergence in other supernovae are discussed in   [ sect : othersn ] , and further discussion and conclusions are offered in   [ sect : conc ] .",
    "the bolometric luminosity that follows the explosion of a massive star is powered by the internal energy of the expanding envelope , emitted as thermal photons . under `` bolometric '' we do not include the hard x - ray and @xmath25ray photons that are emitted in radioactive decays and escape from the envelope before thermalization . in most core collapse supernovae , luminosity in the early ( up to tens of days ) light curve",
    "is powered by energy deposited in the envelope by the supernova shock .",
    "after this energy is depleted , only ongoing sources of energy can continue to power the later part of the light curve , often referred to as a `` tail '' . by definition , radiative emission from late fallback qualifies as an ongoing source , as do decays of radioactive elements in the envelope .",
    "it is useful to examine the evolution of the light curve in terms of the key characteristic time scales and luminosity scales , which can be estimated on the basis of the explosion energy and the average properties of the progenitor ( arnett 1980 , 1996 ) . when accretion onto the central object caused by late - time fallback is taken into account , additional time scales and a luminosity scale",
    "must also be included @xcite .",
    "we briefly review these basic estimates below .",
    "they will serve also as the basis for establishing the rescaling scheme presented in the appendix .",
    "for an envelope with initial radius @xmath26 and outer velocity @xmath27 we can define an initial _ expansion time scale _ , @xmath28 , as @xmath29 assuming that after the passage of the shock the envelope settles into free streaming and homologous expansion ( as is typical in strong spherical shocks ) , the initial velocity of a shell at radius @xmath30 in the expanding envelope is simply @xmath31 .",
    "for free streaming the radius of the shell will follow @xmath32 , and since the expansion is nearly adiabatic , the temperature @xmath33 and density @xmath34 of the radiation - pressure dominated gas decline according to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these quantities determine the leakage rate of thermal photons from the envelope material , and hence govern the history of the early light curve .      during the time that the initial internal energy is the dominant source for radiative luminosity ,",
    "the evolution of the light curve is governed by the properties of the optically - thick , hydrogen - rich outer layer , that holds most of this energy .",
    "we denote the mass , initial average density and initial average temperature of this layer as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the initial post - shock temperature of the envelope is generally high enough ( @xmath39@xmath40 ) so that the envelope material is highly ionized , and the dominant source of opacity , @xmath41 , is thomson scattering .",
    "correspondingly , the thermal photons are mostly trapped in the envelope , and a radiative luminosity occurs through diffusion of thermal energy to the surface . for a homogeneous expanding envelope",
    "this diffusion luminosity can be approximated by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44 a numerical factor which depends on the temperature profile .",
    "the value @xmath45 ( exact for the `` radiative - zero '' temperature profile , @xmath46 ) is usually a reasonable estimate @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of equation  ( [ eq : l_diff ] ) includes the expansion time @xmath28 and the initial diffusion time @xmath47 , which is the characteristic time scale for radiation to cross the envelope through diffusion at the onset of expansion .",
    "the characteristic time for radiation to diffuse out of the _ expanding _ envelope is given by @xcite @xmath48^{1/2}{1\\over { ( c v_0)}^{1/2 } } \\\\   \\;\\;\\",
    "; \\equiv   \\left[\\frac{1}{3}\\kappa r_0 ^ 3\\rho_{0,h}\\right]^{1/2}{1\\over{(c v_0)}^{1/2 } }    \\ ; .",

    "however , the onset of recombination in the envelope usually occurs early enough so that the actual value of @xmath51 is irrelevant .      as the temperature of the envelope",
    "is gradually degraded by expansion , it eventually reaches the characteristic recombination temperature of the envelope material . in a hydrogen - rich envelope",
    "this temperature can be estimated by @xmath52 ( approximately @xmath53@xmath40 ) , so that for adiabatic expansion we find a _ recombination time scale _",
    "@xmath54    the main impact of recombination in the context of the light curve is that it imposes a sharp decrease in the opacity to the envelope s own thermal photons : as the envelope material recombines , it rapidly transforms from opaque to transparent .",
    "this process is rapid enough so that the photons can not readjust to the global thermal profile of the envelope ; rather , a recombination `` front '' sweeps inward through the envelope ( but outward in the laboratory frame ) , essentially liberating all the thermal energy which is still stored in the envelope at the time @xmath55 . as the envelope material recombines , it rapidly transforms from opaque to transparent .",
    "in many type ii supernovae the time until adiabatic expansion cools the envelope to the recombination temperature is usually smaller or equal to the diffusion time scale and significantly shorter than the transparency time scale , so a significant fraction of the initial thermal energy is still available at the time of recombination .",
    "this energy is then released over the time required for the hydrogen envelope to recombine , generating what is usually an observable peak in the light curve ( sn1987a providing a proto - typical example ) .",
    "roughly , the average luminosity during the recombination peak can be estimated as @xmath56 assuming that energy losses due to photon diffusion have been negligible , which is a good approximation if @xmath57 . in equation  ( [ eq : l_rec ] )",
    "@xmath58 is the radiation constant .",
    "note that the nonlinear nature of the physics governing the propagation of the recombination front through the envelope limits the applicability of using the average quantities of the envelope to fully describe the light curve during the recombination phase ( see more detailed estimates in nomoto et al .",
    "1994 , arnett 1996 ) .",
    "a complete analysis of a realistic light curve must also include the effects of heating due to decays of radioactive isotopes synthesized in the explosion .",
    "after recombination , we can estimate that the envelope is practically transparent to its thermal photons , so that the luminosity due to radioactive heating is roughly equal to the instantaneous energy deposition rate due to the decays , through thermalization of the decay products .",
    "the rate of energy deposition in the envelope by the decays of an initial total mass @xmath59 of a given isotope @xmath60 can be expressed as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the life - time of the element @xmath60 .",
    "the form of equation  ( [ eq : q_x ] ) distinguishes between the photons ( @xmath63-rays ) and positrons emitted in the decays ( with energy rates per unit mass of @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively ) since @xmath63-rays are not totally trapped in the envelope , and their contribution to heating is modified by a trapping factor , @xmath66 . on average ,",
    "the hard photons lose about half their energy in every scattering , until their energy is degraded to tens of kev . at these energies free - bound absorption on heavy elements",
    "becomes the dominant source of opacity and the photons are thermalized rapidly .",
    "because the @xmath63-ray opacity rises very rapidly with decreasing energy , we can assume to first order that once a hard photon scatters it is absorbed .",
    "the trapping factor can be simply approximated as @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the @xmath63-ray column depth and opacity for the typical photons emitted in the decays of element @xmath60 .",
    "since the inner ( more dense ) layers are the dominant contributors to the optical depth for @xmath63-rays , the helium - rich layer can be used to estimate the total @xmath25ray optical depth .",
    "the time - dependent column depth is @xmath70 in equations  ( [ eq : f_x]-[eq : phi_0 ] ) it is implicitly assumed that the expansion time @xmath28 is universal to the entire envelope ; otherwise , it must be replaced with the characteristic expansion time of the helium - rich layer .",
    "note that equation  ( [ eq : phi_0 ] ) allows us to express the trapping factor in terms of the initial ( and presumably known ) global quantities of the helium - rich layer . the quantity @xmath71 ( which appears here to the power @xmath72 ) is a useful one also in the context of accretion ( see chevalier 1989 , and in detail below ) .",
    "in addition to the characteristic time @xmath62 , another characteristic time involving radioactive heating is the @xmath25transparency time , similarly to equation  ( [ eq : t_trns ] ) . since @xmath63-rays carry the bulk of the energy emitted in the radioactive decays , it is important to compare this time , @xmath73^{1/2 } \\frac{1}{v_{0,he } } \\\\   \\;\\;\\ ;   \\equiv [ \\kappa_{\\gamma , x } r_{0,he}^3 \\rho_{0,he}]^{1/2}{1\\over v_{0,he}}\\ ; ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the other characteristic times governing the light curve history . at times",
    "@xmath74 some of the hard photons emitted in the decays of element @xmath60 escape before thermalizing and do not contribute to the bolometric light curve .",
    "we note again , that equation  ( [ eq : t_trnsgam ] ) assumes , as before , that the bulk of the envelope s opacity to hard photons is contributed by the helium - rich layer .",
    "the relevant radioactive isotopes for powering the light curve are @xmath14and its daughter nucleus @xmath1 , @xmath9and @xmath10 .",

    "if the order of magnitude of the accretion luminosity and initial abundance of the dominant radioactive isotope , @xmath59 are known , the _ time _ of emergence of the accretion luminosity is determined mostly by the value of @xmath62 , with some finer tuning due to the exact values of @xmath144 , @xmath59 , and the time dependence of @xmath25ray trapping .",
    "note that the efficiency of @xmath25trapping decreases with time as @xmath145 , so the dependence of the time of emergence on @xmath146 and @xmath147 is even weaker .",

    "in order to explore the possibility of detecting black hole emergence in realistic supernovae in detail , we perform a numerical study . time - dependent simulation of the supernova envelope including accretion requires solution of the relativistic radiation hydrodynamic equations coupled to the moment equations for radiation transport and makes use of a detailed model for the ejecta that includes radioactive decay , realistic composition and opacities .",
    "the equations of relativistic , radiation hydrodynamics for a self - gravitating matter fluid interacting with radiation and the general relativistic moment equations for the radiation field have been presented in @xcite ( to which we refer for details ) .",
    "these equations were solved using a semi - implicit lagrangian finite difference scheme in which the time step is controlled by the courant condition and the requirement that the fractional variation of the variables in one time - step be smaller than  10% .    a fundamental obstacle in tracking the evolution of envelope expansion and accretion for several years arises from the extremely wide diversity of relevant time scales in the problem .",
    "these range from the dynamical time in the accreting region ( milliseconds close to the horizon ) to days for the expansion time scale , to hundreds of days for the evolution of the light curve .",
    "since the innermost layers of the envelope have the shortest physical time scales , the computational time can be considerably reduced with a careful choice of the location of the inner boundary . during computation , we keep the inner radial boundary of the integration domain @xmath160 at hundreds to thousands of schwarzschild radii , far outside the black hole horizon , but still but always _ well within _ the accreting region .",
    "this measure is acceptable because the gas in the inner accreting region is in local - thermal - equilibrium ( lte ) and in near free - fall , thus allowing a reliable set of boundary conditions at @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "however , during evolution the effective optical depth in the accreting region decreases because of the secular decrease in density caused by expansion .",
    "thus , in order to ensure that the gas is always in lte at @xmath160 , the inner radial boundary must be continuously moved inward during the simulation .",
    "we note that with this treatment , the position of the inner boundary usually limits the effects of general relativity to be quite small .",
    "however , we did not alter the general - relativistic nature of the code , especially since we can not determine a priori how far out the inner boundary can be set ( in particular at late times , when it is continuously being moved inward ) . furthermore , while the accretion luminosity is insensitive to placing the inner boundary away from the black hole horizon for the canonical parameters of sn1997d , in more general scenarios it may be essential to apply the exact general relativistic formalism with an inner boundary in the strong - field domain .    even taking advantage of the increase in the physical time scales ( and hence in the time step ) by suitably positioning @xmath160 , the computational time needed to evolve the solution up to emergence is excessive . to reach the emergence stage in a reasonable computational time ,",
    "the code employs a `` multiple time - step procedure '' ( mtp ) , originally developed by @xcite . with this technique",
    ", the integration domain is divided into several sub - grids , and each is evolved on its own characteristic time step .",
    "starting from the same initial conditions and integration domain , the simulation performed using this mtp proved to be faster by a factor of @xmath161 than one where no time - step acceleration algorithm was employed .",
    "we note that the most sensitive aspect of the mtp is maintaining accurate communication between the subgrids ; correspondingly , it can be used safely only when there are no sharp features crossing the envelope ( i.e. , after recombination ) .",
    "the main focus of the preliminary investigation of @xcite was to study the fundamental features of fallback in a supernova and , in particular , to determine the gross properties of the accretion history and luminosity .",
    "to this end , a simplified pure - hydrogen model of the envelope , generally sufficient to produce a typical early light curve of a type - ii supernova , was adopted . here",
    "our goal is to examine black hole emergence in realistic supernovae , and so we expand the original survey of @xcite to take into account for variable chemical composition of the expelled envelopes , namely radial dependent abundances of various elements . in particular , we must account for the presence of radioactive isotopes and the heating of the envelope by their decays .",
    "inclusion of a variable composition is necessary to reproduce realistic supernova light curves , as has been established in studies of sn1987a @xcite . for the purpose of following the radiation hydrodynamic evolution of the accretion flow onto the black hole , chemical composition and opacity in the accreting region can have important quantitative and qualitative effects",
    "first , there is an inherent quantitative dependence in the estimate of equation  ( [ eq : blondin_l ] ) , which suggests that a pure hydrogen envelope produces an accretion luminosity larger by a factor of a few than a helium - metal - rich one .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that the presence of metals in sufficient quantities may impose a qualitative change in the accretion history due to increased opacity where the material is partially ionized .",
    "additional effects may arise through the the equation of state , but in the case of supersonic accretion we expect these to be negligible .    in this work",
    "we study a supernova envelope with a mixtures of hydrogen , helium and oxygen , where the relative partial fractions vary along the radial profile of the envelope .",
    "oxygen is expected to be the most abundant heavier element in the ejected envelope , and we adopt an approximation that it represents the entire metal component in the envelope s final composition ( we note that over most of the density and temperature ranges of interest , an addition of iron at solar abundance would change the frequency - integrated opacities by no more than @xmath162 ) . for opacity and ionization fractions , we use the tops opacities available at the lanl server @xcite , with extrapolation to low temperatures based on @xcite .",
    "the data are stored in the form of tables , with spacing of five entries per decade in both temperature and density for a given composition . in the course of computation the rosseland and plank opacities and ionization fractions",
    "are calculated with linear interpolation in temperature , density and chemical composition .",
    "the gas equation of state is approximated as an ideal gas of ions and electrons .      for the purpose of computing the contribution of radioactive decays to the light curve ,",
    "a consistent treatment of radioactive heating is required to follow the trapping efficiency , @xmath163 , throughout the envelope . if the rate of radioactive heating is large enough it may also affect the hydrodynamic evolution of the envelope material ( there exists observational evidence for such an effect by @xmath14decay in the early history of sn1987a - the `` ni - bubble '' , arnett et al .",
    "the role of radioactive heating may be especially important in the case of interest here , since most of the radioactive elements are likely to lie in the inner part of the envelope , which is the reservoir for accretion .",
    "the exact distribution will depend on the extent of mixing caused in the process of the explosion @xcite .",
    "significant heating at early times may accelerate some of the material which was initially bound to the black hole and unbind it , hence imposing a smaller late - time accretion rate . on the other hand , at late times",
    ", even a small amount of heating can maintain a finite ionization fraction , which in turn will impose a larger photospheric radius , hence affecting the luminosity .",
    "in our numerical study we introduce an effective treatment of radioactive elements by including a local heating rate .",
    "we assume that the abundance of radioactive elements is proportional to the oxygen fraction @xcite , with the relevant radioactive isotopes listed in table  [ tab : radioactives ] .",
    "we use the approximation discussed in   [ subsect : basrads ] that a @xmath63-ray photon is absorbed after its first scattering .",
    "the trapping factor of the @xmath63-rays emitted at radius @xmath30 in the envelope can then be estimated as @xmath164 where the quantity in parenthesis is the appropriate @xmath63-optical depth at radius @xmath30 . in our simulation",
    "we impose a further approximation that all the trapped energy is absorbed locally at the point of emission .",
    "we note that this simplified treatment of radioactive decay energy deposition is satisfactory during the first evolutionary stages when the ejecta are still very optically thick to @xmath63-rays .",
    "later on , however , the constant opacity / single scattering assumption gives only an approximate description of the transfer of @xmath63-rays through the envelope .",
    "in fact , as the ejecta become marginally thick , photons can be scattered or absorbed after traveling a significant distance , making non - local effects important .",
    "an accurate calculation of the energy deposition and the @xmath63-ray luminosity would require the solution of the energy - dependent transport problem for the @xmath63 rays , which we do not attempt .",
    "our effective approach reduces the treatment of radioactive heating to an additional local energy source . by determining the total deposited energy rate @xmath165 through equations  ( [ eq : q_x ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : f_gam ] ) , we modify the energy equation ( eq.[25 ] of zampieri et al .",

    "our emphasis in this work is the peculiar type ii sn1997d , that may provide the first direct observational evidence of black hole formation in supernovae .",
    "this source is the only current candidate where an actual observation of the light curve at emergence of the black hole may be ( marginally ) possible .",

    ", @xcite found that sn1997d was an extremely peculiar type ii supernova .",

    "the most unique feature of sn1997d in the context of black hole emergence is the very low mass of @xmath1deduced from the light curve tail ( beginning at @xmath177days after the first observation ) .",
    "the magnitude and shape of the tail are consistent with a very low abundance of @xmath1 , @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "this important result has been recently confirmed by @xcite on the basis of a new set of photometric data which extends up to 1.5 years after the explosion .",
    "@xcite found that the light curve and spectra were best reproduced with @xmath179ergs explosion of a @xmath20 main sequence star ( see young et al .",
    "1998 for details ) .",
    "the progenitor structure prior to collapse was an @xmath180 helium - rich core surrounded by an @xmath181 hydrogen - rich envelope .",

    "the large amount of fallback is a consequence of the low explosion energy , and provides a natural explanation for the very low observed @xmath1mass .",
    "since @xmath21 is almost certainly larger than the maximum mass of neutron stars ( even a rapidly rotating one ; cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) , we can expect that a black hole was formed by sn1997d .",
    "we note that a different model of a low mass ( @xmath182 ) progenitor was suggested by @xcite to explain the early light curve , as well as a low @xmath1abundance .",
    "in such an explosion little fallback would have occurred and the remnant would be most likely a neutron star . the late time light curve shows no evidence of the presence of a neutron star @xcite , which would have been observable if it were a crab - like pulsar , or if it was spherically accreting from late - time fallback . hence a black hole ( and therefore a massive progenitor ) is more consistent with the existing photometric data .",
    "assuming that the black hole model for sn1997d is correct , its remnant includes a black hole surrounded by a low - velocity ejecta with a small abundance of radioactive elements .",

    "this difference is an inevitable consequence of the fact that the bound material is not actually expanding homologously , since the gravitational deceleration can not be neglected . for a realistic supernova envelope",
    "there is no time instant when the entire envelope is in coherent homologous motion .",
    "as a first approximation , we assume that the entire envelope has a common expansion time , which turns out to be @xmath201hrs for an initial radius of @xmath202 and a hydrogen envelope of @xmath181 .",

    "this rescaling scheme , presented in detail in the appendix , has allowed for an additional acceleration of a factor of @xmath286 in computational efficiency , thus reducing the total required computational time to an acceptable limit .",

    "the enhancement required for these rates in the course of rescaling ( see in the appendix ) further compounds the applicability of the rescaling scheme at very early times .",
    "therefore our numerical approach has been to perform the simulation of the model in its original scale until three conditions are met : 1 ) the time dependent marginally bound radius is significantly smaller ( a factor of 5 ) than the accretion radius ; 2 ) the accretion rate through the inner boundary is smaller than @xmath288 and 3 ) that total energy to be emitted in the decays of the remaining @xmath14is significantly smaller than the internal energy at that time . we find that these conditions are all satisfied at the physical time of about @xmath289days , which is when the simulation was stopped , rescaled by a factor of 5 , and restarted .",

    "the calculated accretion luminosities also agree to within a few percent , although it is the model with radioactive isotopes that suggests a higher luminosity .",

    "closer to the black hole the increased temperature increases the degree of ionization of the helium - rich material , and the comoving luminosity rises again to a local maxima .",
    "note that the mass flux remains self similar through out the evolution , as the accreting region grows in size but the expansion of the envelope reduces the magnitude of the accretion rate .",

    "how often can we expect an opportunity to observe a black hole emerging in a supernova ?",
    "an upper limit is , of course , the rate at which black hole forming supernovae occur . adopting the recent results of @xcite that about @xmath234 of core collapse supernovae make black holes , we expect a rate of about one event per thousand years per galaxy .",
    "there are somewhat less than one thousand galaxies at a distance @xmath375mpc from the milky way , and hence there may be approximately one observable event ( equal or better than sn1997d ) per several years .",
    "this estimate is an upper limit , since a significant fraction of high mass progenitors will end their lives as type ib / ic supernovae after losing their hydrogen envelope , and such supernovae are unfavorable for a practical observation at emergence .",
    "furthermore , even `` perfect '' candidates may not allow for an actual observation , as seems to have been the case in sn1994w .",
    "following its recombination peak , the tail of the sn1994w light curve failed to settle on an exponential decay that would arise due to @xmath1decay @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the last data point led to a limit of @xmath376 on the mass of @xmath1 in the ejected envelope .",
    "however , the light curve showed a very steep power - law in time until it dropped below the detection threshold some 220 days after the explosion .",
    "the luminosity during this phase was much too high to be due to accretion ( @xmath377ergs@xmath3 ) and @xcite found that it was most likely caused by interaction with circumstellar material , with dust formation also playing an important role .",
    "we can only speculate that in the absence of circumstellar interaction and dust extinction , the light curve would have declined exponentially after the recombination peak and the accretion luminosity may have emerged while still marginally detectable .",
    "the case of sn1994w implies that the rate of potential observable black hole emergence may be significantly smaller than that of black hole forming type ii supernovae .",
    "nonetheless , we urge that any type ii supernovae which shows a diminished @xmath1abundance should be monitored , and its light curve be tracked for several months after the explosion .",
    "the prospects of observing black hole emergence may improve significantly with potential future instruments , such as ngst or a dedicated faint - supernovae project .",
    "we are grateful to tim young for providing us with the results of early - time simulations for sn1997d and to chris fryer , robert kirshner , phillip pinto and massimo turatto for useful discussions .",
    "we thank monica colpi and roberto turolla for carefully reading the manuscript .",

    "the inclusion of the accreting region imposes an inherent obstacle in any numerical simulation of a supernova light curve . in the innermost accreting region",
    "the material is free - falling at a velocity which is a significant fraction of the speed of light , so that the dynamical time scale is less than @xmath378sec . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolutionary time for the light curve is of the order of tens of days to clear the recombination phase , and years to reach black hole emergence if there is a non - negligible amount of radioactive elements in the envelope .",
    "this extreme diversity of time scales prevents any single calculation which tracks the entire envelope .",
    "as described by @xcite , a considerable increase in the shortest physical time scale ( and , hence , the courant integration time step ) can be obtained moving the inner boundary , @xmath160 , outward ( at hundreds to thousands of schwarzschild radii , but always _ well within _",
    "the accreting region ) .",
    "this turns out to be possible because the gas in the inner accreting region is in lte and in free - fall , thus allowing a reliable setting of the boundary conditions even if @xmath160 is much larger than the black hole horizon . when a lagrangian zone passes through the inner boundary , it is removed from the calculation and the remainder of the envelope quantities are rezoned to maintain a satisfactory resolution .",
    "even with such a relocation of the inner boundary , the feasibility of a numerical computation requires some additional measures to accelerate the computation . to this end",
    ", the code incorporates the multi - time - step procedure , where the integration domain is separated into several subgrids , and each is evolved at its own local time scale ; most of the cpu time is thus devoted to evolving the regions with smaller time steps .",
    "we note that this procedure requires a communication scheme between the sub - grids based on extrapolation , and can be safely used when there are no sharp features propagating through the envelope .",
    "thus , we use it only after that the recombination front has completed its sweep of the envelope material . the speed - up allowed by",
    "the mtp is typically a factor of 5 - 8 .",
    "unfortunately , moving the inner boundary outward and using the mtp is not sufficient when the target physical time is of the order of years . in the case of sn1997d ,",
    "tracking the evolution of the envelope for @xmath379days would require roughly 1000 cpu hours on the sgi 500mhz ev6 compaq xp1000 processor which we have used for the simulations . we were hence compelled to develop an additional acceleration algorithm , which is a rescaling scheme that allows us to integrate to the black hole emergence stage within a reasonable computational time .",
    "the main objective in devising a rescaled model of a specific supernova evolution is to maintain all the quantitative features of the realistic model , while reducing the required computational time .",
    "the code uses an explicit lagrangian scheme .",
    "since the photon transport is treated by actually solving the transport equation , the reference velocity is the speed of light , and the courant time step is determined by the width of the thinnest zone .",
    "this is always the innermost zone , @xmath380 , which at any time @xmath381 is a given fraction of the position of the inner boundary , @xmath382 .",
    "the efficiency of the code is essentially determined by comparing the ( small ) ratio of the time step to a characteristic evolutionary time  for example , the expansion time scale , @xmath28  @xmath383 the essence of a rescaling scheme would then be devising a rescaled model where @xmath384 where a subscript @xmath385 denotes the rescaled quantities .",
    "the rescaled model is then more efficient by a factor of @xmath386 .",
    "successful rescaling must ( a ) provide a simple relation between its own physical quantities and that of the realistic model and ( b ) maintain the hierarchy ( inequalities ) of time and energy scales that exists in the realistic model , so that the relative importance of the different physical process is carried on into the rescaled model .",
    "the rescaling scheme we have chosen to employ in our simulations is detailed below",
    ".      a natural rescaling scheme would be one where all the physical quantities of a mass element ( @xmath387 ) of the realistic model are mapped with simple linear relations to the rescaled model , i.e. , @xmath388 , etc . in our rescaling scheme",
    "we distinguish between the local thermodynamic and kinematic quantities of the mass elements in the envelope .",
    "since the photon opacities are sensitive and complex functions of the thermodynamic quantities , i.e. , density and temperature , we find it preferable to leave these quantities unchanged in the course of rescaling @xmath389 , which leads to @xmath390 .",
    "note that such a choice also implies that the inner boundary of the realistic model should approximately map onto the inner boundary in the rescaled model , since the position of the inner boundary is determined by the requirement of lte , which arises from the local values of temperature and density",
    ".    once this choice has been made , the constraints on the rescaling scheme are quite straight forward .",
    "if we require that the ratio of diffusion and recombination times scales to the expansion time scale remain unchanged , i.e , @xmath391 the rescaled model must satisfy ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : t_diff],[eq : t_rec ] ] ) : @xmath392    the condition ( [ eq : resrv ] ) is sufficient to determine the rescaling strategy when consistently mapping all radii between the realistic and the rescaled models .",
    "if all radii are decreased by a factor of @xmath393 , all velocities must be increased by the same factor ; the efficiency of the simulation ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : effcode ] ) ] ) is then increased by a factor of @xmath394 .",
    "if we further impose invariant luminosity ratios according to @xmath395 we arrive ( using eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : l_diff0],[eq : l_rec ] and [ eq : l_acc0 ] ] ) at the condition @xmath396 the principle relations of our rescaling scheme are thus @xmath397 this choice of rescaling allows us to consistently map the marginally bound shell of the envelope , since the marginally bound radius , @xmath105 also rescales as @xmath398 .",
    "the efficiency of rescaling is explicit in the rescaling of time  in the rescaled model all physical times are reduced by a factor of @xmath400 , while the _ numerical _ time step is only reduced by a factor of @xmath401 .",
    "the rescaling scheme presented above is not without limitations ; most notably , the acceleration factor , @xmath393 is limited to a value of a few , as discussed below .",
    "nonetheless , even a value of @xmath402 , which was used in the case of sn1997d reduces the required computational time from weeks to days , hence allowing for a practical numerical investigation .",
    "since the rescaling scheme calls for an increase of a factor of @xmath393 of the envelope velocities , clearly @xmath393 can not be arbitrarily large , since we must maintain a sub - relativistic envelope .",
    "furthermore , since the black hole mass is increased , its schwarzschild radius increases as well , and naturally it should not be allowed to approach the integration domain throughout the calculation .",
    "both these constraints result in the practical limit on the value of @xmath393 to no more than a few",
    ".      the scaling laws of luminosity and mass in equation  ( [ eq : restlmmdot ] ) create an undesired inconsistency regarding the luminosity from radioactive heating , since for this source @xmath403 . in order to recover the correct rescaled power output from radioactive decays , the energy generation rate from radioactive decays per unit mass in the envelope must therefore be increase by a factor of @xmath400 .",
    "this could potentially impose a significant deviation in the evolution of the rescaled model from that of the original one , if it artificially enhances the importance of energy deposition from radioactive decays when compared to the other energy scales .",
    "however , since we limit ourselves to envelopes where the abundance of radioactive elements is very small , the artificial amplification of the energy production per unit mass of radioactive decays has a negligible effect .",
    "it is further noteworthy that the effective transparency of the photons to the @xmath63-ray photons emitted in the decays must be adjusted in order to recover the appropriate scaling of the @xmath25transparency time .",
    "the simple form of @xmath63-ray opacity ( eq .  [ [ eq : t_trnsgam ] ] ) allows to achieve consistency with the change @xmath404 , so that @xmath405 .",
    "a similar transformation for the optical photons would be more complex , but can be neglected since the onset of thermal - photon transparency is imposed by recombination ( rather than expansion ) , and is chiefly determined by the thermodynamic variables @xmath34 and @xmath33 , which are kept invariant .      a second inconsistency that arises in this particular rescaling scheme concerns the initial accretion time and radius , @xmath406 .",
    "as is evident from equations  ( [ eq : t_acc0 ] , [ eq : r_mb - r_acc ] ) , when the thermodynamic properties of the helium layer are not changed , so that the sound speed is conserved , @xmath407 .",
    "our rescaling scheme actually _ increases _ these quantities by a factor of @xmath393 , while other characteristic times and radii are _ decreased _ by factors of @xmath400 and @xmath393 , respectively .",
    "this is an inevitable consequence of our choice of rescaling .",
    "this inconsistency is significant , however , only while the accretion flow is bondi ( 1952)-like , when @xmath408 and @xmath409 @xcite . as the envelope continues to expand , the hierarchy of time scales and radii is eventually reversed and the accretion eventually transforms into a dust - like flow .",
    "since the accretion time does not enter explicitly in any of the estimates for evolution and luminosity ( see   [ sect : basics ] ) , it is only this hierarchy which is of real consequence , and hence rescaling can be applied safely to models which are characterized by @xmath410 , @xmath411 .      a similar analysis concerns the ratio of kinetic and thermal energies in the envelope .",
    "it is clear that the kinetic energy will scale as @xmath412 , while the internal energy ( neglecting radioactive heating ) will scale as @xmath413 , since the temperatures are unchanged .",
    "rescaling thus amplifies the relative importance of kinetic energy over thermal energy in the expanding envelope .",
    "however , as is the case for the accretion and expansion time scales , the real issue is the hierarchy of energy scales .",
    "in fact , the assumption of homologous expansion is equivalent to assumption that the conversion of thermal energy to kinetic energy is negligible , i.e. , that @xmath414 , which is satisfied in the context of our rescaled models .",
