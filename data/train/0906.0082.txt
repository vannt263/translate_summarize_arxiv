    "the main goal of the araucaria project is to improve the calibration of the cosmic distance scale from accurate observations of the various primary stellar distance indicators in nearby galaxies ( e.g. gieren et al .",
    "in the course of our project we are observing cepheids , rr lyrae stars , red clump stars , blue supergiants , eclipsing binaries and the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) brightness in both optical and infrared ( ir ) domains . since with ir",
    "photometry one can minimize the influence of interstellar reddening on the derived distances , and in many cases also the population dependence of the standard candles , this part of our project is particularly important for precise distance determinations to our target galaxies , and therefore for a more accurate calibration of the extragalactic distance scale . in our previous papers we already demonstrated that red clump stars ( pietrzynski and gieren 2002 ; pietrzynski , gieren and udalski 2003 ) , cepheids ( e.g. pietrzynski et al .",
    "2006 ; gieren et al . 2005a , 2006 , 2008a , 2008b ; soszynski et al .",
    "2006 ) , and rr lyrae stars ( pietrzynski et al .",
    "2008 , szewczyk et al .",
    "2008 ) in the ir domain are very accurate tools for distance determination to nearby galaxies . in this paper",
    "we extend our near - infrared distance work to the trgb method in the j and k bands , starting with the two dwarf spheroidals carina and fornax . the success of the trgb method as a tool for distance measurement begun in 1993 when lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) convincingly showed that the optical i band magnitude of the trgb does not depend on metallicity and age in environments with metallicity lower than about - 0.7 dex .",
    "subsequently , very detailed studies of a possible population dependence of the i band trgb magnitude ( e.g. kennicutt et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 ; udalski , 2000 ) confirmed the finding of lee et al . and converted the i - band trgb method into a widely used standard candle .",
    "due to its simplicity and the relatively large absolute brightness of stars at the tip of the red giant branch in the i band ( about -4 mag ) , over the past decade this method has been applied to most of the nearby galaxies ( e.g. ferrarese et al . , 2000 , karatchentsev et al . , 2003 ) . however , a very important problem in this technique was the potentially strong influence of reddening on the distances obtained from the optical data , especially for galaxies located at low galactic latitudes .",
    "very recently important progress has been achieved by ivanov and borissova ( 2002 ) and valenti , ferraro and origlia ( 2004 ) , who have provided an accurate calibration of the j , h and k band absolute magnitudes of the trgb . because of the fact that the trgb magnitude in the ir domain is much brighter than in the optical ( @xmath0 @xmath1 -6 mag ) , is very insensitive to reddening ( which in the near - ir domain is an order of magnitude smaller than in the optical ) , and that the infrared calibration is valid over a very broad range of metallicities ( -2.2 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -0.4 dex ) these works opened the possibility to use the infrared trgb magnitude to measure accurate distances to galaxies located out to several mpc .",
    "the technique has been already applied to derive distances to several nearby galaxies ( e.g. cioni et al .",
    "2000 ( magellanic clouds ) , rejkuba 2004 ( ngc 5128 ) ) .    our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the observations , and the reduction and calibration methods we used",
    ". then we present the distance determination to the fornax and carina local group galaxies , followed by a discussion of the errors associated to our results and a comparison with the distances previously derived for these galaxies from other techniques .",
    "finally we present a summary and final remarks .",
    "the near infrared data presented in this paper were collected as a part of the araucaria project , with the eso ntt telescope on la silla equipped with the sofi infrared camera ( moorwood , a. , cuby , j.g . ,",
    "lindman , c. , 1998 ) . the large field mode , with a field of view of 4.9 x 4.9 arcmin , and a scale of 0.288 arcsec / pixel was used .",
    "during one night 9 and 4 sofi fields were observed in carina and fornax , respectively ( see table 1 and figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "these galaxies were already subject of earlier deep ir imaging performed by our group with the eso vlt ( pietrzynski , gieren and udalski 2003 ) .",
    "however , those observations were optimized for studying the relatively faint red clump stars , and the stars having brightnesses similar to the trgb magnitude were saturated in these images , or fall into the nonlinear regime of the isaac camera . therefore , in order to measure accurately the k and j band magnitudes of the trgb in carina and fornax we decided to observe them again with the sofi camera , using very short integrations of 1.5 s. such short exposures guarantee that high quality photometry can be obtained for stars having magnitudes as bright as the expected magnitudes of the trgb in our target galaxies . in order to account for rapid sky level variations in the infrared domain ,",
    "our observations were performed with a dithering technique . in the k and j band filters , we averaged over 20 ( carina ) and 10 ( fornax ) consecutive 1.5 s integrations ( dits ) at any given pointing before moving the telescope to a randomly selected different position within 20@xmath220 arcsec square .",
    "12 such dithering positions were sufficient to extract the sky and obtain obtain photometry deep enough to measure accurately the trgb magnitude in both filters .",
    "the reductions were performed in a similar manner to those described in pietrzyski and gieren ( 2002 ) .",
    "the sky was subtracted from the images with a two - step process implying masking of the stars with the @xmath3 iraf package .",
    "then , the individual images for each field and filter were flatfielded and stacked into a final composite image . the psf photometry was carried out with the daophot and allstar programs . about 10 - 20 relatively bright and isolated stars were selected visually , and the first psf model was derived from them . then , following pietrzyski , gieren and udalski ( 2002 ) , we iteratively improved the psf model by subtracting all stars from their neighbourhood and re - calculating the psf model .",
    "after three such iterations no further improvement was noted , and the corresponding psf model was adopted as the final one .    since the observations were performed under non - photometric conditions we decided to transform our data onto the standard system using the 2mass data .",
    "typically about 30 stars from the 2mass point source catalog ( wachter et al .",
    "2003 ) were found in a given sofi field .",
    "the scatter ( rms ) of the calculated zero point offsets was always smaller than 0.01 mag .",
    "several of the observed fields overlap with the regions observed by pietrzyski , gieren and udalski ( 2003 ) .",
    "therefore it was possible to check the zero point of our photometry transformed onto the 2mass system with the carefully calibrated deep photometry obtained by these authors . in each case",
    "the difference in the corresponding zero points was found to be smaller than 0.02 mag .",
    "we therefore conclude that the zero point uncertainty of our photometry does not exceed 0.02 mag .",
    "from the k , j - k color - magnitude diagrams for carina and fornax obtained from our data ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the stars on the rgb were selected and their respective luminosity functions were calculated using a bin size of 0.08 mag , which represents a reasonable compromise between the number of stars in a magnitude bin , and the magnitude resolution we can achieve . in each galaxy the location of the trgb is well marked ( see figure 4 ) and does not depend neither on bin size nor on the starting point of the histogram .    in order to obtain trgb magnitudes in a more objective way we computed the gaussian - smoothed luminosity functions and use the sobel edge - detection filter , following the procedure described in detail by sakai , madore and freedman ( 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting luminosity functions and the outputs of the edge - detection filter for the j and k bands and both galaxies are presented in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "as can be seen , the location of the highest peak in the edge - detection filter output , which we interpreted as the trgb magnitude , is very well defined in both filters , in each galaxy .",
    "the automatically detected trgb locations agree very well with those obtained from the visual inspection of the binned luminosity functions .",
    "the presence of agb stars adds additional noise in the procedure of the trgb analysis , and if the intermediate - age population is very large in a given galaxy the trgb detection may in principle be difficult .",
    "this effect was studied in detail by makarov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and barker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who conlcuded that the trgb detection is quite insensitive to the agb contamination .",
    "as can be seen in figs . 5 and 6 , the locations of the most significant peaks in the sobel filter outputs , and therefore the corresponding j or k band magnitudes of the trgb , could be unambiguously identified in both galaxies .",
    "we would like to notice that our k band trgb magnitude of 14.45 @xmath4 0.04 mag differs by some 3 sigma from the results obtained by gullieuszik et al .",
    "( 2007 ; 14.59 @xmath4 0.03 ) .",
    "this difference is most probably caused by the different technique of trgb detection employed by these authors ( i.e. , the maximum likelihood algorithm ( mla ) of makarov et al .",
    "rizzi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , applying both sobel filter and mla techniques to the same hst data set of ngc 300 , obtained results which in some cases were different by 0.08 mag .",
    "in table 2 we report the j and k band magnitudes of the trgb in the carina and fornax galaxies obtained with the sobel filter technique .",
    "the galactic foreground reddenings toward the galaxies were estimated from the schlegel , finkbeiner and davis ( 1998 ) extinction maps and are e(b - v)=0.03 for fornax , and e(b - v)=0.06 for carina .",
    "following pietrzyski , gieren and udalski ( 2003 ) , we adopted for the ( mean ) metallicities of the rgb the values -1.0 dex for fornax ( saviane , held and bertelli 2000 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "2002 ) , and -1.7 dex for carina ( koch et al .",
    "2006 , koch et al .",
    "these adopted reddening and metallicity values are also given in table 2 .    in order to derive the infrared trgb distances , the empirical calibration of valenti , ferraro and origlia ( 2004 ) which was obtained from extensive near - infrared observations of 24 galactic globular clusters covering the wide metallicity range from -2.12 to -0.49 dex",
    "was used ( equations 1 and 2 ) .",
    "it was demonstrated by these authors that these calibrations agree very well with the predictions from theoretical models .",
    "@xmath5}$ ] ( 1 ) + @xmath6}$ ] ( 2 ) + adopting the metallicities and reddenings listed in table 2 , and our measured trgb magnitudes , the following true distance moduli were calculated from these calibration equations :    carina : 20.09 @xmath4 0.03 ( j band ) , 20.13 @xmath4 0.04 ( k band ) + fornax : 20.84 @xmath4 0.03 ( j band ) , 20.84 @xmath4 0.04 ( k band ) + for both galaxies , the respective distances from the j and k bands agree within the statistical uncertainties of the trgb magnitudes .",
    "with the assumed uncertainty of the photometric j and k band zero points of 0.02 mag , an estimated error associated to the extinction determinations of 0.02 mag , and an assumed uncertainty in the adopted metallicities of 0.2 dex we calculate the total systematic uncertainties of our distance moduli determinations for carina and formax to be of 0.12 mag and 0.14 for the j and k band filters , respectively , for both galaxies .",
    "the dominant part in the systematic uncertainties of the current infrared trgb distances to carina and fornax comes from the assumed uncertainties on the appropriate metallicities of the red giant branch tip stars .",
    "their effect on the distance has been estimated from the metallicity coefficients in equations 1 and 2 .",
    "it should be noted here that we did not take into account any contribution from possible systematic errors in the coefficients themselves in the calibration of valenti , ferraro , and origlia ( 2004 ) . as our final distance results ,",
    "we adopt a true distance modulus of ( 20.11 @xmath4 0.13 ) mag for the carina dsph galaxy , and ( 20.84 @xmath4 0.15 ) mag for the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "results of previous distance determinations to the fornax and carina galaxies from different methods reported in the literature are given in table 3 .",
    "pietrzyski , gieren and udalski ( 2003 ) obtained from deep k band imaging of red clump stars true distance moduli of 20.165 @xmath4 0.015 mag and 20.858 @xmath4 0.013 mag for carina and fornax , respectively .",
    "similar results were obtained for the carina distance from an analysis of its rr lyrae stars ( 20.10 @xmath4 0.12 mag ; dallora et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) , from its optical trgb and horizontal branch ( hb ) luminosities ( 20.05 @xmath4 0.06 mag and 20.12 @xmath4 0.08 mag ; smecker - hane et al . 1994 ) , and from dwarf cepheids ( 20.06 @xmath4 0.12 mag ; mateo et al .",
    "a shorter distance to carina of 19.94 mag was calculated by udalski ( 2000 ) from i band photometry of red clump stars and the trgb , and from v band photometry of rr lyrae stars .",
    "however , udalski s distance estimation for carina was tied to a short assumed lmc distance of 18.24 mag , which is probably an underestimation of the true lmc distance modulus ( e.g. schaefer 2008 , fouqu et al .",
    "2007 ) . correcting the lmc distance to a more likely value near 18.5 would bring udalski s result for the carina distance in close agreement with the present work , and the other results cited above .",
    "regarding the fornax dsph galaxy , optical photometry of the trgb and hb has yielded the following distance moduli : 20.76 @xmath4 0.02 ( buonanno et al . (",
    "1999 ) , 20.70 @xmath4 0.12 ( saviane et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , 20.65 @xmath4 0.11 ( bersier ( 2000 ) , and 20.71 @xmath4 0.07 ( rizzi et al .",
    "greco et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measured @xmath7 = 20.72 @xmath4 0.10 for this galaxy from rr lyrae stars .",
    "a slightly shorter distance modulus ( 20.66 mag ) was obtained by bersier from i band photometry of red clump stars .",
    "recently gullieuszik et al .",
    "( 2007 ) derived the distance modulus for fornax from near - infrared photometry of the trgb ( 20.75 @xmath4 0.19 ) and red clump stars ( 20.74 @xmath4 0.11 ) applying population corrections derived from models .",
    "our current distance result for fornax is at the upper limit of the distribution of these earlier measurements , but within its uncertainty clearly consistent with these .",
    "it is likely that the quality of the distance determinations to galaxies from their trgb in the optical i band and in the near - ir jk bands is quite similar as to the correction of the effect of the varying metallicities of different red giant populations ; however , a decisive advantage of the infrared trgb method is its basic insensitivity to reddening corrections .",
    "while this has no strong consequences in the case of the carina and fornax dwarf galaxies due to their low foreground reddenings , and ( assumed ) negligible internal reddenings , things might be very different when highly reddened galaxies are under study .",
    "> from near - infared photometry of the carina and fornax dsph galaxies we have derived the distances to these galaxies using the calibration of the trgb absolute magnitudes in the j and k bands given by valenti , ferraro and olivia ( 2004 ) . we have obtained the following results :    20.09 @xmath4 0.03 @xmath4 0.12 mag ( carina , j band ) + 20.14 @xmath4 0.04 @xmath4 0.14 mag ( carina , k band ) + 20.84 @xmath4 0.03 @xmath4 0.12 mag ( fornax , j band ) + 20.84 @xmath4 0.04 @xmath4 0.14 mag ( fornax , k band ) + our distance determinations are in very good agreement with the results obtained from deep infrared imaging of red clump stars , and an analysis of the optical photometry of the trgb and hb , and rr lyrae stars in these galaxies .",
    "our results show that the k and j band magnitudes of the trgb in sufficiently metal - poor galaxies are promising tools for distance determinations .",
    "however , in order to further check and potentially improve this technique it should be applied to measure distances to other galaxies showing a broad range of environments .",
    "a comparison of such results with the distances measured from other distance indicators from both optical and near infrared photometric data should shed more light on the population dependence of the stellar distance indicators , and also on the problems related to the interstellar extinction corrections .",
    "curently our group is involved in near infrared imaging of several other nearby galaxies which will enable such comparative studies .",
