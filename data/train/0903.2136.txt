    "in celestial mechanics , the @xmath0-body problem has two types of singularities : collisions between two or more bodies , and escapes in bounded time . in order to study the behavior of the system close to singularities ,",
    "it is a common procedure to transform it to another equivalent system that avoids the singularities by means of some methods called _ regularizations_. there are a lot of regularizing transformations , but unfortunately it is not always possible to regularize an arbitrary singularity . for instance",
    ", infinite expansions at finite time produce esential singularities in the mathematical model that are not regularizable by topological or analytical methods known until now , and the same is true for some multiple collisions .",
    "basically there exist two types of regularizations : analytic regularization formalized by siegel and moser @xcite , and surgery or topological regularization ( also known as block regularization ) discovered by conley and easton @xcite . in particular , it is well - known that rectilinear binary collisions , collisions between two infinitesimal bodies ( in @xmath0+@xmath1 problems ) and triple collisions are impossible to regularize by the easton method @xcite .",
    "marchal @xcite has a very clear exposition about the classification of the singularities in the @xmath0-body problem and their regularization ( when it is possible ) .    in this paper",
    "we deal with the analytical or siegel s regularization @xcite which is achieved by three ingredients : a local change of coordinates by means of some local diffeomorphism @xmath2 on the phase space , a scaling function @xmath3 that introduce a new fictitious time @xmath4 by the relation @xmath5 and a set of initial conditions @xmath6 of the flow which specifies the solutions that go to collision ; since @xmath0-body problems are hamiltonian problems , the set of initial conditions determines an energy level by the conservation of the energy .",
    "it means that in hamiltonian problems the analytical regularization process is performed on each fixed energy level @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the process is as follows :    * choose a fixed energy level @xmath7 and consider @xmath8 * apply the change of coordinates @xmath9 of the phase space @xmath10(w)=0\\ ] ] * apply the scaling transformation @xmath5 multiplying the last expression @xmath11(w)\\ ] ] * the preimage of @xmath12 generates the energy levels of the regularized system for each @xmath13 fixed .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the aim of regularization theory is to transform singular differential equations into regular ones , controlling the velocity of the regularized system by the scaling time @xcite .",
    "for the one - dimensional kepler motion with hamiltonian function @xmath14 it was already found by euler that the introduction of a square - root coordinate @xmath15 and a fictitious time @xmath4 defined by @xmath16 reduces the kepler equation of motion ( [ eqn : kep1 ] ) to the equation of motion of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath17 if @xmath18 @xcite ; where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "generalizing this approach , levi - civita introduces its `` _ _ ... transformation du systme qui donne lieu  des consquences remarquables ... _ _ '' in @xcite . in his work",
    "levi - civita introduces a conformal transformation and exploits the symplectic structure of the complex plane @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , this regularization is made on the cotangent bundle @xmath23 where @xmath24 is viewed as an open symplectic manifold .",
    "levi - civita regularization is achieved by the local diffeomorphism @xmath25 and the time rescaling @xmath26 .",
    "the transformation above takes the hamiltonian function @xmath27 into the equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the symplectic form in the regularized phase space is @xmath31",
    ". the expression ( [ eqn : levi ] ) is a contact transformation since it preserves the canonical liouville 1-form @xmath32 . if we denote the image of the local diffeomorphism by @xmath33 then @xmath34 that is , @xmath35 ; as a consequence we have a symplectic ( canonical ) transformation .",
    "applying the exterior differential to both sides of ( [ eqn:1form ] ) we obtain the symplecticity condition @xmath36 for the transformation . in 1913",
    "sundman introduced a transformation that maps the unitary circle in @xmath37 into the band @xmath38 , and obviously this mapping does not preserves the area ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pp 127 - 129 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the procedure described above is difficult to generalize to the 3-dimensional case since the euclidean space @xmath39 does not posses any complex structure .",
    "however , the kustaanheimo - stiefel s regularization @xcite , generalizes the levi - civita regularization to the four dimensional complex manifold @xmath40 ( real dimension 8) and projects it onto some symplectic submanifold of real dimension six .",
    "in recent years , the k - s transformation using quaternions and the quaternionic algebra has gained much attention , from the works of vivarelli @xcite , volk @xcite , vrbik @xcite , waldvogel @xcite , among others",
