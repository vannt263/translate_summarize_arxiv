    "in the past two decades , nanoscopic physics has developed significantly and becomes an active field of condensed - matter physics .",
    "the quantum transport property also becomes one of the most interesting phenomena in nanoscopic physics because of the possibility of designing and fabricating artificial setups in the nanometer scale .",
    "based on the transport physics in nanoscopic system , a rich field for basic and applied research is opened.@xcite furthermore , the time dependent nanoscopic transport , in which the external time dependent fields drives the electrons tunnel through a nanoscopic system , has received increasing attention in recent years .",
    "the main feature of the transport in the nanometer scale is that the electron keeps the phase coherence when traversing through the device . while the external time dependent field affects the phase factor of the incident electron differently in different parts of the system.@xcite if the external time dependent field is sinusoidal ( e.g. microwave radiation ) , an electron can tunnel through the system by emitting or absorbing photons giving rise to the photon - assisted tunnelling ( pat ) .",
    "electron transport with pat has been extensively investigated for various systems , such as single or two coupled quantum dot ( qd),@xcite kondo regime,@xcite hybrid system,@xcite and so on . for transient transport ,",
    "one of the most interesting issues is how fast can a device turn on or turn off a current . with the development of the molecular devices",
    ", there is clearly a need to technologically provide a particular viable switching device .",
    "indeed , some recent experimental and theoretical works have already begun to study the response of ac signals of the molecular devices.@xcite consequently , a step or pulsed ac signals are the simplest choice , since it can provide a less ambiguous measure of time scales .",
    "for this reason , the pulsed field was studied in a variety of systems , including kondo regime , @xcite a single qd,@xcite or nano structure,@xcite .",
    "so far , the study of response of pulsed bias is only focused on normal nanostructures . since the interplay between nanoscopic physics and the physics of superconductivity has made the hybrid structure a very fruitful research field,@xcite it will be interesting to study the dynamic response a hybrid structure with a superconductor lead where the andreev reflection is present near the normal - superconductor ( n - s ) interface .",
    "indeed , there are many interesting phenomena in the n - s hybrid systems .",
    "first of all , because there exists an energy gap @xmath4 in the superconductor , an incident electron from the normal side with energy @xmath5 inside the gap @xmath4 can not tunnel into the superconductor .",
    "but the tunneling can occur via a two - particle process , in which the incident electron is reflected as a hole with the energy @xmath6 . at the same time , a cooper pair is created in the superconductor region .",
    "this is the andreev reflection.@xcite secondly , for the superconductor - normal region - superconductor ( s - n - s ) system , andreev bound states form in normal region due to the andreev reflections at n - s interfaces.@xcite these bound states exist in pairs , and a josephson supercurrent can flow through the s - n - s system which is carried by the andreev bound state.@xcite thirdly , when the s - n - s device is under an external dc bias @xmath7 , an ac current with frequency @xmath8 appears .",
    "the time - average current versus bias @xmath7 exhibit the subharmonic gap structure when @xmath9.@xcite    in this paper , we explore the effect of andreev reflection on the ac response of hybrid system .",
    "specifically , we investigate ac response of a quantum dot ( qd ) with a single level @xmath10 connected by a normal and a superconductor lead ( n - qd - s ) . for simplicity , we consider a large qd so that the intra - dot electron - electron ( e - e ) is weak and can be neglected.@xcite the transient transport is driven by a pulsed bias potential @xmath11 . for simplicity , the ac pulsed bias is only added in the left lead , and we set @xmath12 .",
    "we consider two different pulsed bias : ( i ) upwards pulse with @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "( ii ) downwards pulse with @xmath15 when @xmath14 and @xmath13 otherwise . for normal structures , wingreen",
    "_ et al . _",
    "presented a general formula for the current driven by the time dependent external fields by using the non - equilibrium green function ( negf ) method.@xcite with this general formula the time dependent current driven by the ac pulse can be calculated . for hybrid structures ,",
    "the system is in steady state at @xmath14 and the current is time independent . at @xmath16 ,",
    "bias is abruptly turned on for the upwards pulse case or turned off for the downwards pulse case .",
    "after that , the system begins to relax and the andreev reflection plays an important role in the relaxation process .",
    "finally , the system enters into a new steady state .",
    "we find that , the relaxation time depends on the coupling strength and is slower in the n - qd - s system ( named hybrid system hereafter ) than in the n - qd - n system ( named normal system hereafter ) .",
    "in the linear bias regime , the rising and falling processes are symmetric so that the turn - on time is same as the turn - off time . in this regime",
    ", the andreev reflection is important . as a result",
    ", the instantaneous current shows a clear increase ( decrease ) before reaching the new steady state for the downwards ( upwards ) pulse . for the large bias case ,",
    "the time dependent current oscillates with the frequency @xmath17 .",
    "in this regime , the upwards and the downwards processes are asymmetric and the turn - on time is much larger than the turn - off time . in this nonlinear regime ,",
    "the andreev process is negligible and the current in the hybrid system is close to that of the normal system .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , the theoretical formula for calculating the time dependent current in n - qd - s system is presented . to understand the numerical results ,",
    "the current away from the current at @xmath16 is expanded to the first order in the external bias . in sec.iii",
    ", we show the numerical results along with some discussions . finally , the brief summary is given in sec .",
    "considering a hybrid system that consists of a qd coupled to a normal metal lead and a superconductor lead with the external time dependent bias potential @xmath18 that is added only on the left normal lead .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is written as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 describe the left normal lead and the right superconductor lead , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 is hamiltonian of the isolated central qd , and the @xmath23 couples the left and right leads to the qd .",

    "the operator @xmath26 and @xmath27 destroy an electron with spin @xmath28 in the qd and in the left or right lead , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider a single level in the qd and neglect intradot electron - electron coulomb interaction . under the adiabatic approximation",
    ", the time - dependent bias potential can be included in the single electron energy @xmath29 .",
    "we separate @xmath29 into two parts : @xmath30 and @xmath18 , where @xmath30 is the time - independent single electron energy and @xmath18 is a time dependent part from the external time dependent bias potential . in this paper , @xmath18 is the step - like pulse with two different forms : ( i ) upwards pulse with @xmath13 when @xmath14 and @xmath15 otherwise , ( ii ) downwards pulse with @xmath15 when @xmath14 and @xmath13 otherwise .",
    "these two types of pulse describe the system abruptly turned on or turned off at time @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath4 in the hamiltonian @xmath21 is the superconducting energy gap .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is a real parameter by selecting a special phase of the superconductor lead in our calculation.@xcite due to the existence of the superconducting lead , it is convenient to introduce the nambu representation.@xcite in the nambu representation , the fermi energy of the left normal lead is set at the superconducting condensate and for the spin down electron the energy is negative and is viewed as the hole .",
    "so , the hamiltonian in eqs.([h ] ) can be rewritten in the matrix form : @xmath31 where @xmath32    the current from the left lead to the qd can be calculated from the evolution of the number operator of the electrons in the left lead , @xmath33.@xcite using the keldysh equation and the theorem of analytic continuation , the current through the left normal metal lead is expressed as:@xcite @xmath34_{11}-[g^r(t , t')\\sigma^<_l(t',t)\\nonumber \\\\ & & + g^<(t , t')\\sigma^a_l(t',t)]_{22}\\ } \\label{cur0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the green function @xmath35 and the self - energy @xmath36 are all two dimensional matrices in the nambu representation . since the spin up and spin down are symmetric in the hamiltonian , the current contributed by the electrons with spin up is same as the current by the spin down electrons .",

    "the system is in the steady state .",

    "in the numerical calculation , we set temperature to zero . in fact , finite temperature only makes the current curve more smooth and does not affect main features .",
    "we focus on the weak coupling case with @xmath110 and set @xmath111 as energy unit .",
    "the energy gap of the superconductor is @xmath112 .",
    "the energy level @xmath10 in the central region is assumed to be zero which is same to the right fermi level . because at @xmath113 the system is in the steady state and the current is time independent , so we only plot the current @xmath68 and the related quantities for @xmath114 in the following discussion .",
    "first of all , we study the small pulse bias @xmath0 limit , in which the instantaneous current @xmath68 can be expanded as : @xmath115 , and we also take the symmetric barriers , i.e. , @xmath116 . the first - order expansion parameters",
    "@xmath117 of the currents @xmath69 and @xmath70 versus the time @xmath85 are plotted in fig.1 . here the indices @xmath118 and @xmath119 denote the upwards and downwards pulses , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also show the corresponding parameters @xmath117 for the normal system in fig.1(b ) . from fig.1",
    ", we can see that the expanding parameters @xmath120 for the upwards and downwards pulses are symmetric , i.e. @xmath121 .",
    "it means that in the small @xmath0 limit ( i.e. the linear regime ) , the current turned off or turned on by the downwards or upwards pulses in exactly the same manner with the same time scale for both normal system and hybrid system . in other words , the case of the downwards pulse is the reversal process of the upwards pulse .",
    "so in the following , we use the upwards pulse as an example in the linear region .    at time @xmath122",
    ", the driving bias is zero for the upwards case .",
    "the system is in equilibrium state so the current @xmath123 is zero and @xmath124 and @xmath125 cancel to each other . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the bias is abruptly switched on . at @xmath86 , the bias @xmath18",
    "is kept at @xmath0 all along , the electrons with the energy in the bias window begin to traverse through qd . as the time",
    "@xmath85 increases , @xmath124 and @xmath125 deviate from the initial value ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "a net current gradually increases and the device is gradually turned on . as a result , for the time @xmath85 from @xmath126 to about @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 gradually increase ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this increasing process is almost the same for the normal system and the hybrid system . for the normal n - qd - n device",
    ", the relaxation process completes near the time @xmath130 and @xmath129 is the half of @xmath128 at large time . on the other hand , for the hybrid n - qd - s device ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath128 is approximatively the same as that of n - qd - n at large time , but @xmath129 begins to decrease when @xmath131 , and it goes to zero at the end of the relaxation process .",
    "so the current @xmath132 for the n - qd - s device is twice as large as that of the n - qd - n device .",
    "we interpret these properties as follows .",
    "for the normal system , the fact that @xmath133 is twice of @xmath134 is because @xmath133 and @xmath134 are respectively contributed by the electrons tunnelling from the left lead into the empty qd and from the qd into the empty left lead with the electronic energy @xmath66 between @xmath126 and @xmath0 , and in this energy range the distribution of the left lead is @xmath135 but the distribution in the qd is @xmath136 for @xmath137 . while for the hybrid n - qd - s system , after the bias is turned on , the andreev reflection begins to play a role . for @xmath124 ,",
    "there is not much difference between the normal and hybrid systems , since the electrons always tunnel from the left lead into the qd in both systems .",
    "but for @xmath125 , instead of reflecting electrons from qd into the left lead in normal system , the andreev process reflects back the hole out of qd , which makes @xmath125 decrease .",
    "note that @xmath138 can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath139 in the small bias limit ( @xmath140 ) and @xmath141 , nearly all of the incoming electrons participate in the andreev reflection .",
    "because of this , @xmath142 goes back to the initial ( t=0 ) value .",
    "so @xmath143 decreases to zero at @xmath137 .",
    "next , we study the case of large pulse @xmath0 .",
    "fig.2(c ) and ( d ) depict the currents @xmath144 and @xmath145 versus time @xmath85 for the large pulse strength @xmath146 . for comparison , @xmath144 and @xmath145 for the small pulse strength @xmath147",
    "are also plotted in the fig.2(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the currents @xmath144 and @xmath145 in the large bias case have the following characteristics : ( i ) in the small bias limit , the relaxation processes of upwards and downwards are symmetric .",
    "however , in the large pulsed bias @xmath0 case , they are asymmetric ( see fig.2c and 2d ) . for larger pulse bias @xmath0 ,",
    "the asymmetry are stronger .",
    "( ii ) for the large bias case , @xmath124 for the upwards pulse oscillates with the frequency @xmath148 , which can be clearly seen in fig.2c and 2d for @xmath146 . at @xmath147",
    "the oscillation disappears because @xmath148 is too small to oscillate before the system is completely relaxed .",
    "( iii ) @xmath125 ( @xmath149 ) of hybrid system increases ( decreases ) in the first and then decreases ( increases ) , and it reaches maximum ( minimum ) before the current relaxed completely .",
    "this is different from the normal system , in which the currents @xmath125 and @xmath149 are monotonously relaxed into the steady state .",
    "( iv ) the decreasing ( increasing ) process of the current @xmath125 ( @xmath149 ) in the large bias case is much weaker than that of the small bias case ( see fig.2b and d ) . because for the large pulse , the energy of the incident electrons @xmath66 is large , then @xmath150 from eq.([andr ] ) and the andreev reflection is weak .",
    "so most of the incident electrons participate in the normal reflection .",
    "consequently , @xmath144 is humped up ( or down ) slightly .    since the currents @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    "can not be observed independently , in the following we study the total current @xmath68 ( @xmath151 ) which can be measured in the experiment .",
    "fig.3 shows the current @xmath152 driven by the upwards and downwards pulses versus the time @xmath85 for the different pulse strengths @xmath0 . here",
    "the current responses to the upwards and the downwards pulse are symmetric at small linear bias @xmath0 ( see inset of fig.3 ) , but are asymmetric at the large bias @xmath0 ( see main of fig.3 ) . at the large @xmath0",
    ", @xmath153 oscillates with the frequency @xmath154 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath155 always changes slowly regardless of the large and small @xmath0 .",
    "now we focus the turn on / off time ( or rise / fall time @xcite ) and the relaxation time ( or saturation time @xcite ) . the former describes how fast can a device turn on / off a current , which is necessary to provide a particular viable switching device , and the latter was referred to how fast can the device goes to a new steady state after a bias is abruptly switched on .",
    "for the small bias @xmath0 , the turn - on time , turn - off time , and the relaxation time are almost same regardless of the normal and hybrid systems .",
    "however these ( turn on / off or relaxation ) times for the normal n - qd - n device are much shorter than that of the hybrid n - qd - s device . for the normal device , it has been well turned on or off at @xmath156 .",
    "but for the hybrid device , the system is turned on or off until @xmath157 .",
    "on the other hand , for the large bias , the current @xmath68 of the hybrid system has the same character with that of the normal system , so do the turn - on / off time and the relaxation time .",
    "note that these three time scales are not equal now .",
    "the turn - on time is the fastest , even faster than the scale @xmath158 .",
    "the turn - off time is in the scale @xmath158 , which is longer than the turn - on time.@xcite the relaxation is @xmath159 , which is the longest and only depends on the coupling strength @xmath3 . let us explain why the character of @xmath68 for the normal and hybrid system are the same at large @xmath0 but very different at small @xmath0 . because at the large bias @xmath0 , most of the incoming electron have the large energy @xmath66 , then @xmath150 from eq.([andr ] ) and the andreev reflection is weak , so the n - qd - s device and the n - qd - n device have the same turn - on / off and relaxation time .",
    "but for the small bias @xmath0 , the resonant andreev reflection is dominant in the transport process in the hybrid system , so that the current @xmath160 of the hybrid system is twice as that of the normal system , and their character of @xmath68 also are very different .",
    "so we will only discuss the small pulsed bias @xmath0 case further in the following .",
    "at last , we consider the case of asymmetric barriers ( i.e. , @xmath161 ) and in the small pulsed bias @xmath0 .",
    "because in the small @xmath0 the time - dependent current @xmath68 for the upwards and downwards pulse are symmetric , we only study the upwards case .",
    "fig.4 plots the current @xmath162 versus the time @xmath85 for the different asymmetric coupling strengths @xmath163 , and they have the following behaviors : ( i ) as @xmath163 ( i.e. @xmath164 ) increases , the current @xmath165 rises faster , i.e. the turn - on time is shorter , because electrons with the energy in bias window can tunnel through the left barrier more easily with the larger @xmath164 .",
    "this rising process of @xmath123 are nearly same for the normal and hybrid systems .",
    "( ii ) after the rise of @xmath123 ( at @xmath166 ) , andreev reflection begins to dominate and gives rise to different sequent relaxation processes for the normal and hybrid systems . at @xmath167 , @xmath165 of the hybrid system",
    "humps slightly in the relaxation process , which is obviously different from the normal system in which @xmath165 is monotonically relaxed into steady state . when @xmath141 , @xmath165 of the hybrid system passes a step and increases again .",
    "the relaxation time for the hybrid system is much longer than that of the normal system when @xmath168 .",
    "when @xmath169 , the relaxation processes of @xmath165 are similar for the hybrid system and the normal system .",
    "these behaviors can be interpreted by combining the density of state ( dos ) of the qd with the andreev reflection possibility @xmath138 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath169 , the dos of the qd in the hybrid system is similar to that of the normal system and @xmath150 , so that the two systems have the similar turn - on / off and relaxation characteristic . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath141 or @xmath167 , the resonant or the near resonant andreev reflection occurs , andreev bound states appears in the qd , and the dos of the qd is very different from the normal system .",
    "this makes the relaxation processes very different for the n - qd - s and n - qd - n systems .",
    "( iii ) although @xmath165 for @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( @xmath172 is an arbitrary real number ) experience different rising and relaxation processes , they have the same steady value at @xmath137 .",
    "in fact , in the steady state case and at the small bias @xmath0 limit , the transmission possibility of the normal n - qd - n device is : @xmath173 and the andreev reflection possibility of the hybrid n - qd - s device is:@xcite",
    "@xmath174 with the current expressions @xmath175 and @xmath176 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath177 and @xmath138 are the same for @xmath178 when @xmath179 , consequently @xmath160 also are same for @xmath178 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the dynamic response of current to the external upwards or downwards pulsed bias for the hybrid n - qd - s system . in the small bias @xmath0 limit , the turn - on / off time and the relaxation process for the upwards and the downwards pulse bias are symmetric . comparing wtih the normal n - qd - n system , the andreev reflection dominates the transport process .",
    "this makes the turn - on / off time much longer and new steady state current almost doubled . for the asymmetric barriers , the transport properties of the hybrid n - qd - s system are nearly same with the normal n - qd - n system when @xmath180 . on the other hand , while @xmath181 the current humps in the relaxation process which reflects the properties of the superconductor . beyond the linear bias regime , the rising process for upwards bias and the falling process for downwards",
    "bias become more and more asymmetric with the increasing bias @xmath0 . the turn - on time is faster than the turn - off time , and the current versus the time @xmath85 oscillates with the frequency @xmath154 .",

    "notice that the retarded self - energy @xmath193 is not affected by the time dependent bias @xmath18 , so it is still the function of the time difference @xmath194 . since the time dependent bias @xmath11 is applied only on the left normal lead and @xmath12 , so the self - energies for coupling to the right superconductor lead are same with the steady state case and they can be written as:@xcite @xmath195 where @xmath196 , @xmath4 is the energy gap of the superconductor lead , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 otherwise .",
    "the turn on / off time describes how fast can a device turn on / off a current , which is also named rise / fall time in the ref.(10 ) .",
    "while the relaxation time was referred to how fast can the device go to a new steady state after a bias is abruptly switched on , it is also named saturation time in the ref.(11 ) .",
