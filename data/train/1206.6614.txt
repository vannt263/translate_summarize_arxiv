    "( aharonian et al .  2009 ) .",
    "its morphology is typical of a young shell - type snr , but with a marked asymmetry in the x - ray surface brightness profile between the fainter northeast and the brighter southwest edges ( vink et al .",
    "2000 ) , as observed both in radio ( dickel et al .  2001 ) and in the optical , where only the region associated with the rcw 86 nebula is visible ( smith et al .",
    "this might imply an off - centred cavity sn explosion , with its centre closer to the southwest edge of the snr and near the centre of the rcw 86 nebula .",
    "recently , williams et al .",
    "( 2011 ) suggested that g315.4@xmath02.3  is a type - ia snr , based on optical and x - ray spectroscopy of the remnant and the lack of a compact source at the centre , which could be identified as the isolated neutron star ( ins ) formed out of a type ii sn explosion . in the radio band ,",
    "kaspi et al .  (",
    "1996 ) could not identify a radio pulsar within the sn shell . in the x - rays ,",
    "vink et al .  ( 2000 ) spotted an unresolved source ( hereafter source v ) @xmath4 southwest of the snr centre , in the direction of the rcw 86 nebula .",
    "however , the possible association with a @xmath5 star coincident with the _ rosat _  5  error circle and evidence for long - term variability suggested that this x - ray source was not an ins , although only a better localisation from x - ray observation at higher spatial resolution can either confirm or refute the association .",
    "more recently , gvaramadze & vikhlinin ( 2003 ) found two x - ray sources with _",
    ", located on the x - ray bright southwest edge of the g315.4@xmath02.3  snr . only the northernmost one ( dubbed source n ) had no optical counterpart ( @xmath6 ) and was proposed as the stellar remnant of the sn explosion .",
    "however , its possible identification as an ins has never been confirmed so far .",
    "source n has not been detected in radio .",
    "one possibility would be that it is a radio - silent ins , possibly a compact central object , or cco ( de luca  2008 ) .",
    "a search for a stellar remnant in the central part of the snr was carried out with _ chandra _  by kaplan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who identified all the detected x - ray sources either as foreground stars or background agns .",
    "thus , source v and n remain the only unidentified x - ray sources potentially associated with the remnant of the sn explosion .",

    "chandra _  data to better determine their positions , verify the association of source v with the bright nearby star , and search for source n s optical counterpart in archival _ very large telescope _",
    "( _ vlt _ ) data .",
    "optical images of the rcw 86 nebula , at the southwest edge of g315.4@xmath02.3  ( fig.1 , top left ) , were obtained in service mode on april , 10 to 12 2010 with the _ vlt _  antu telescope at the eso paranal observatory .",
    "the observations were performed with the _ focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph _   ( _ fors2 _ ) camera ( appenzeller et al .",
    "1998 ) , equipped with its mit detector , a mosaic of two 2k@xmath74k ccds optimised for wavelengths longer than 6000  .",
    "the standard low gain , fast read - out mode , and the high - throughput @xmath8 ( @xmath9  ; @xmath10 ) filter were used .",
    "images were taken with the standard resolution collimator ( 025/pixel ) and a field  of  view ( fov ) of 8@xmath11 . however , due to vignetting the effective sky coverage is smaller , and larger for the upper ccd chip ( @xmath12 ) than for the lower one .",
    "source n was positioned in the upper ccd chip , @xmath13 above the gap between the two chips .",
    "a total of 45 exposures of 300 s each were taken under dark time and photometric conditions with an average airmass of @xmath14 and image quality of @xmath15 .",
    "we reduced the science images using standard tools in the iraf package ccdred for bias subtraction and flat  field correction .",
    "we then aligned and average - stacked the science images using the swarp program ( bertin et al .",
    "2002 ) , applying a @xmath16 filter to reject hot / cold pixels and cosmic ray hits .",
    "since all exposures were taken with comparable image quality , we did not apply any selection prior to the image stacking .",
    "we applied the photometric calibration by using the extinction - corrected night zero points computed by the _ fors2 _",
    "pipeline derived from observations of the landolt s standard stars ( landolt 1992 ) .",

    "we selected stars evenly distributed in the fov but far from the ccd edges and the vignetted regions , where geometric distortions are larger .",
    "we measured the star centroids through gaussian fitting using the graphical astronomy and image analysis ( gaia ) tool and used the code astrom to compute the pixel - to - sky coordinate transformation .",

    "we analysed the dataset with the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software ( v. 4.4.2 ) .",
    "we extracted an image in the 0.56 kev energy range using the original acis pixel size ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we ran a source detection using the wavdetect task with wavelet scales ranging from 1 to 16 pixels , spaced by a factor @xmath28 ( consistent results were obtained using the celldetect task ) .",
    "we easily detected source v and computed its position as @xmath29 ; @xmath30 .",
    "the short integration prevented us to check the accuracy of the _ chandra_acis - s absolute astrometry by cross - correlating positions of field x - ray sources to optical / infrared astrometric catalogues .",
    "indeed , no x - ray sources are detected within 4  from the aim point , and poor photon statistics hampers accurate localisation of sources at larger off - axis angle ( where psf blurring becomes significant ) .",
    "we attach to the position of source v , located very close to the aim point ( where the accuracy of the acis astrometry is optimal ) and detected with a good signal  to  noise ( 38 photons with virtually no background ) , the nominal acis radial uncertainty of 06 ( 90% confidence level ) .",
    "we repeated the exercise for source n using a 93 ks _ chandra_/acis - s observation ( obs .",
    "1993 ) . in this case",
    ", the much deeper integration allowed us to detect several point x - ray sources in the field , which we used to check the astrometric accuracy .",
    "we selected x - ray sources detected at @xmath31 and cross - correlated their positions with the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "unfortunately , we found only one match found within 4  of the aim point .",
    "thus , we included larger off axis regions . using 9 matches within 8",
    ", we assessed that no corrections were needed to the acis astrometry ( r.m.s .",
    "difference of @xmath32 per coordinate ) .",
    "we computed the position of source n as @xmath33 ; @xmath34 , with a nominal radial uncertainty of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 confidence level ) .",
    "this position is consistent with that measured by gvaramadze & vikhlinin ( 2003 ) .",
    "( bottom left ) shows a @xmath37 zoom of the dss-2 image centred on the _ chandra _  position of source v. the source is positionally coincident ( within the @xmath38 accuracy of the dss-2 astrometry ) with the bright star already proposed by vink et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as its potential counterpart .",
    "thus , thanks to the factor of 10 better positional accuracy of _ chandra _ with respect to _ rosat _ , we can conclude that source v is associated with this star and can not be an ins .",
    "this means that source n remains the only possible candidate .",
    "1 ( bottom right ) also shows a @xmath37 zoom of the _ fors2 _  v - band image around source n s position .",
    "the position of source s of gvaramadze & vikhlinin ( 2003 ) is also shown .",
    "however , this was already excluded by these authors as a candidate ins , based on its association with a dss-2 star ( v@xmath39 ) , saturated in the _ fors2 _  images .",
    "we found a point source overlapping the revised _",
    "error circle of source n , which we propose as its candidate optical counterpart .",
    "we computed its flux through standard aperture photometry and derived a magnitude @xmath40 . to quantify the robustness of the association , we computed the probability of a chance coincidence between source n and its candidate counterpart .",
    "we defined it as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the matching radius ( 07 , taking account both the uncertainties of the _ chandra _ position and the accuracy of our _ vlt _  astrometry ) , and @xmath43 is the density of stellar objects in the _ fors2 _",
    "fov with magnitudes comparable to the candidate counterpart . for @xmath44",
    "arcsec@xmath45 , this gives @xmath46 . unfortunately , there are no other images of the field in the eso archive , to obtain colour information on source n s counterpart . using a dss-2 red - band image ,",
    "gvaramadze & vikhlinin ( 2003 ) set an upper limit of @xmath47 on source n , which implies a @xmath48 . from the same image we estimated a @xmath49 upper limit of @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "however , due to the high sky background ascribed to a group of bright stars at @xmath52 from source n ( fig .  1 , bottom right ) , unresolved in the dss-2 image , these upper limits are affected by a large uncertainty .",
    "this is also true for those obtained from 2mass images .",
    "thus , we can not derive tight constraints on the colours of source n s counterpart .",
    "we used the available x - ray and optical data to determine whether source n can be an ins .",
    "deep observations of source n s field have been obtained both by _ chandra _  ( obs . i d .",
    "1993 ; 93 ks ) and _ xmm - newton _  ( obs . i d .",
    "0504810401 ; 72 ks ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to the positional coincidence with a bright x - ray filament of the snr , which dominates the emission below 2 kev , source n is possibly detected only at energies above @xmath53 2 kev in the _ xmm - newton _  observation , which makes such data not suitable for the spectral analysis .",
    "thus , we used the _ chandra_acis - s data to characterise the x - ray spectrum of source n. we extracted counts for both the point source and background using the specextract script in ciao .",
    "we selected source photons from circular apertures with a 2   radius and background photons from two circles with a radius of 5 .",
    "as done by kaplan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we compared the source counts in the low ( 0.32 kev ) and hard ( 28 kev ) energy bands and computed the hardness ratio @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the counts in the hard and low energy bands , respectively .",
    "the @xmath57 is compatible , within the observed scatter , with those of the x - ray sources detected by kaplan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) at the centre of g315.4@xmath02.3 .",
    "for source v we obtained @xmath58 , which is also compatible with the range of values for these sources .",
    "in particular the @xmath57 is consistent with source v being a star , as implied by its optical identification .",
    "we did a more qualitative spectral modelling of source n using xspec ( v. 12.7 ) . the spectrum of source n is well described ( reduced @xmath59 , 28 d.o.f . ) by a power law ( pl ) with photon index @xmath60 , absorbed by an hydrogen column density n@xmath61 cm@xmath45 .",
    "we note that our pl spectral index is consistent with that measured by gvaramadze & vikhlinin ( 2003 ) , although they fixed the value of @xmath63 cm@xmath45 .",
    "an equally good fit ( reduced @xmath59 , 28 d.o.f . ) can be obtained using a simple blackbody ( bb ) spectrum with kt=@xmath64 kev , absorbed by a low column density n@xmath65 cm@xmath45 .",
    "an optically thin raymond - smith ( rs ) thermal plasma model ( _ raymond _ in xspec ) with kt@xmath66 kev , abundance @xmath67 solar values and an absorbing column n@xmath68 cm@xmath45 also fits well the data ( reduced @xmath69 , 27 d.o.f . ) .",
    "we also fitted the _",
    "chandra _",
    "spectrum with two - component models , as done by gvaramadze & vikhlinin ( 2003 ) , but the fit quality does not improve noticeably with respect to single - component ones .",
    "thus , from the x - ray spectrum alone we can not unambiguously determine the nature of source n. to further investigate the possibility that source n is an ins , we searched for periodicity in the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn data .",
    "however , since these were taken in _ full frame _ mode ( frame time of 73.4 ms ) , the periodicity search is only sensitive to periods @xmath70146.8 ms .",
    "we used tools in the sas package ( v. 11.0 ) to extract x - ray events from a 20  circle centred at the computed _ chandra _   position of source n and converted their times of arrival ( toas ) to the solar system barycentre .",
    "we performed a search for coherent pulsations in different energy bands ( mainly above 2 kev ) using the powspec tool in ftools , but we found no significant signals .",
    "unfortunately , both the limited number of source counts against the high background produced by the bright x - ray filament of the snr and the contamination of source s , only 6  away , did not allow us to obtain constraining limits on the pulsed fraction .",
    "to establish the nature of source n , we evaluated whether the flux of its optical counterpart is compatible with what expected for an ins . for the estimated age of g315.4@xmath02.3  ( @xmath71 yrs ) and an optical luminosity comparable to the crab pulsar , we would expect a flux of @xmath7221.1 , after re - normalising for the g315.4@xmath02.3  distance ( 12.8 kpc ) and interstellar extinction @xmath735 , inferred upon the n@xmath74 derived from the pl fit to the _ chandra _  spectrum using the relation of predhel & schmitt ( 1995 ) .",
    "these values are compatible with the flux of source n s counterpart ( @xmath75 ) , at least for the highest values of the interstellar extinction and distance .",
    "alternatively , source n might be a cco . for a rotational energy loss rate @xmath76 erg s@xmath77",
    "( see de luca et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) , the expected optical luminosity would then be at least two orders of magnitude lower than the crab pulsar , yielding a flux @xmath78 .",
    "we also verified whether the x - ray  to  optical flux ratio of source n is compatible with that of an inss . according to the pl model",
    ", the observed flux in the 0.38 kev energy range is @xmath79 erg cm@xmath45 s@xmath77 , corresponding to an unabsorbed flux @xmath80 erg cm@xmath45 s@xmath77 .",
    "the unabsorbed optical flux of source n s optical counterpart , computed upon the corresponding n@xmath74 , is @xmath81 erg cm@xmath45 s@xmath77 .",
    "thus , the unabsorbed x - ray  to  optical flux ratio of source n would be @xmath820.32 , by far lower than expected for an ins , for which this ratio is usually of 1000 , or higher ( e.g. , mignani 2011 ) .",
    "assuming other best - fitting x - ray spectral models also gives very modest values of the @xmath83 ratio .",
    "this implies that source n must be a different type of x - ray source , maybe an agn , which would be compatible with its @xmath83 ratio ( e.g. la palombara et al .",
    "2006 ) and its possible pl spectrum .",
    "spectroscopy of its optical counterpart is needed to determine the nature of source n. thus , from their associations with bright optical counterparts , we conclude that neither source v nor source n are inss .",
    "no other unidentified point - like x - ray sources which can be considered possible ins candidates have been discovered by _",
    "_  surveys of g315.4@xmath02.3 .",
    "the available _ chandra _  observations ( fig .  1 , top left ) cover a large fraction of the snr .",
    "in particular , the most likely locations where the compact remnant of the sn explosion is expected to be found , i.e. the central regions of the snr and the rcw 86 nebula , have been deeply scrutinised ( e.g. , kaplan et al .",
    "2004 ; gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2003 ) .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that potential ins candidates were missed .",
    "we conclude that the lack of an identified ins supports the conclusion that g315.4@xmath02.3  was not born after a type ii sn explosion ( williams et al .",
