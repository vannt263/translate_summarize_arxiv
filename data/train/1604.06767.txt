    "optical levitation of small particles was first demonstrated by ashkin in seminal work performed more than four decades ago @xcite . since then , optical trapping has become a powerful tool for manipulating atoms @xcite , dielectric particles @xcite , and biological systems @xcite .",
    "recently , optically levitated dielectric microscopic @xcite and nanoscopic @xcite particles have been cooled in both cavity - based @xcite and cavity - free @xcite setups , paving the way for macroscopic quantum mechanics @xcite and ultrasensitive metrology @xcite .",
    "parallel to ongoing experiments aimed at preparing the nanoparticle ground state in a cavityless configuration , a quantum model of parametric feedback cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle was presented recently @xcite .",
    "this model provided a master equation , whose predictions regarding feedback cooling agreed very well with experimental data in the classical regime .    in this article , we derive a fokker - planck ( fp ) equation from the above - mentioned master equation .",
    "as is well known , the fp equation is well - suited for analysing the phase - space distribution for a quantum system , is convenient for studying the quantum - classical boundary , and is also an efficient calculational tool for dealing with high excitation numbers which make simulation of the master equation computationally difficult @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we use the fp approach to analyse one of the features which strongly distinguishes parametric feedback cooling from other active feedback schemes for optomechanical cooling @xcite , namely the highly nonlinear nature of the resultant damping .",
    "it was shown theoretically as well as experimentally earlier that such damping generally results in nonlinear phonon dynamics for - and specifically nonexponential loss of energy from - the nanoparticle @xcite .",
    "such behavior stands in contrast to most optomechanical systems where the mechanical element can be described as a linearly damped oscillator even when coupled to optical radiation , and linear response theory yields a satisfactory description @xcite .",
    "we examine two qualitatively different regimes of nanoparticle feedback damping , namely low and high damping , respectively . in the low damping regime",
    ", we obtain a wigner function which yields a single - peaked position distribution as well as the energy distribution calculated earlier using a classical theory and verified experimentally @xcite . in the high damping regime , in contrast , we predict a _",
    "double - peaked _ position distribution which we trace to an underlying parametric feedback - induced bistability .",
    "unlike in cavity - based systems , where bistability can be explained using the mean ( drift - like ) effects of active @xcite or passive @xcite feedback , in our case the diffusive processes present in the system provide a major contribution to bistable behavior @xcite .",
    "our results open the way to the investigation of levitated cavity - free optomechanical systems in relation to bistability - related fundamental effects such as squeezing @xcite and entanglement @xcite , and for the construction of useful devices @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows .",

    "for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : wigner_64 ] , we calculate the mean phonon number @xmath183 using the numerical solution to eq .  .",

    "this result shows that in the overdamped regime the nanoparticle has a phonon bunching relation close to a thermal mechanical state for which @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the low and high damping regimes for an optically levitated nanoparticle subject to parametric feedback .",
    "we have used a fokker planck treatment , useful for viewing the phase - space distribution of the nanoparticle and calculating higher - order moments of the oscillator variables in the presence of nonlinear feedback . for low damping",
    ", we obtained the position and energy distributions of ref .",
    "@xcite , but starting from a fully quantum mechanical model . for high damping",
    ", we found a feedback - induced bistability .",
    "it is important to note that unlike in the case of cavity - based systems , the bistability manifests itself only in the mechanical , and not optical , degree of freedom .",
    "also , the bistability is crucially influenced by system fluctuations and therefore can not be described using a classical mean value equation as in standard cavity optomechanics .",
    "our prediction should be experimentally observable as we have used realistic parameters in our analysis . using our formalism we have also investigated energy equipartition , phonon number behavior , and phonon bunching for the nanoparticle , which shows close resemblance to that of a thermal mechanical state .",
    "we presented both analytical and numerical results to support our conclusions .",
    "our study opens the door to the use of bistability in cavity - free levitated systems , and provides a framework for studying the phase - space properties of such systems .",
