    "the quantum chromodynamics , or qcd , is established as the fundamental quantum field theory of strong nuclear force underlying all of nuclear physics . despite its great success in describing an impressive variety of nuclear phenomena in nature ,",
    "a key aspect of qcd remains mysterious and poses a great challenge to our understanding .",
    "while the theory has quarks and gluons as its basic degrees of freedom in the lagrangian , the colored quarks and gluons are absent from the observed physical spectrum in which the various color - singlet hadronic states emerge instead .",
    "this phenomenon , often referred to with the broad term `` confinement '' ( see recent review in e.g.  @xcite ) , occurs also in a wide variety of qcd - like theories and notably in pure yang - mills theories .",
    "the latter fact makes it obvious that confinement arises from the nonperturbative gauge dynamics in the gluonic sector .",
    "it was suggested long ago  @xcite , based on analogy with superconductivity , that the confinement may arise from chromo - magnetically charged gauge configurations with nontrivial topology with the vacuum being a `` dual superconductor '' of such magnetic objects ( see review in e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is highly appealing and widely perceived to be a likely explanation .",
    "the idea was extensively explored via lattice simulations as well as has been concretely shown to work in certain supersymmetric theories .",
    "more recently , the idea of `` dual superconductor '' vacuum has been further advanced into a `` magnetic scenario '' for the hot plasma phase in the temperature regime above but near the transition temperature @xmath0  @xcite : indeed if there is a magnetic superconductor below @xmath0 , there should be a `` precursor '' i.e. the normal phase of thermal magnetic plasma just above @xmath0 .",
    "there are strong evidences from lattice simulations  @xcite for this scenario and most interestingly such a magnetic component is found to be crucial for explaining a number of key transport properties of the qcd plasma near-@xmath0 as measured from heavy ion collision experiments  @xcite . despite the various progress so far along this line of thought , it is nevertheless still unclear what types of configurations could drive confinement and how , in pure yang - mills and qcd - like ( non - supersymmetric ) theories .    let us elaborate a bit on the difficulty to identify the relevant topological configurations for these theories",
    ". conventional instantons ( as well as their finite - temperature counterpart , the calorons )  @xcite are well known topological objects and studied in details ( see reviews in e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however these conventional instantons / calorons only have _ trivial holonomy _ , that is , trivial polyakov loop at spatial infinity @xmath1 (  see  [ ap : hlmy , ap : holpol ] for a detailed discussion about holonomy ) , which is in sharp contrast to the confining vacuum where the holonomy is maximally nontrivial .",
    "furthermore they are color neutral with no chromo - magnetic charge . therefore such conventional instantons / calorons can not be responsible for confinement .",
    "another natural candidate would be t hoof - polyakov type of magnetic monopole .",
    "however , a crucial difference of pure yang - mills or qcd ( as compared with e.g. george - glashow model or seiberg - witten therory ) is that they do _ not _ have adjoint scalar fields which would provide the natural `` higgsing '' on the spatial boundary , thus allowing the construction of magnetic monopole solutions . because of this difficulty , one has to rely upon certain gauge - fixing procedure to manifest the monopoles in the pure yang - mills or qcd cases .",
    "as it turns out , both difficulties are resolved recently in a crucial new development : the construction of _ caloron solutions with nontrivial holonomy and nontrivial topology _ to the classical yang - mills equations , known as the kvbll calorons  @xcite (  see [ ap : kvbll ] for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "first of all , such new calorons by construction acquire the necessary sensitivity to holonomy and thus are able to play a role in the confinement dynamics .",
    "even more nontrivially , such a caloron contains @xmath2 different _ dyons _ ( for @xmath3 theory ) which are chrome - magnetically charged and whose properties depend upon the holonomy . in these solutions ,",
    "the nontrivial holonomy provides the needed nontrivial boundary constraints ( that in `` higgsed '' theories would come from the adjoint scalar fields ) .",
    "owing to such important new features , the kvbll calorons with their dyon constituents provide the unique topological configurations that could potentially account for the nonperturbative dynamics underlying confinement .    based on the kvbll solutions ,",
    "a promising approach has emerged for understanding confinement in a statistical ensembles of dyons / anti - dyons from the constituents of the kvbll calorons .",
    "early works on an uncorrelated ensemble of these objects  to be called _ instanton - dyons _",
    "( following recent literature ) from now on in the present paper  already indicated that their contributions ( alone ) to the holonomy potential tends to push the system toward confining holonomy  @xcite .",
    "however it was later found that such contributions would not be enough to overcome the one - loop perturbative contributions to the holonomy potential ( which favors the trivial holonomy  see detailed discussions in [ ap : holpol ] ) .",
    "it was later found by shuryak and collaborators  @xcite that an effective dyon - anti - dyon interaction with a short - range repulsive core ( or in a broader term , a strong dyon - anti - dyon short - range correlation ) appears necessary to enforce the confining holonomy at temperatures lower than the confinement transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "effective model for a coulomb plasma of such dyons / antidyons was also constructed and shown to give a reasonable description of the low temperature @xmath4 properties of yang - mills theories  @xcite .    in this paper , we report a thorough numerical investigation of the confinement dynamics in su(2 ) yang - mills theory by constructing such a statistical ensemble of correlated instanton - dyons .",
    "we present high precision results for the temperature dependence of the holonomy potential , the order parameter for confinement transition , the dyon ensembe properties ( densities and density - density correlations ) , as well as the temporal and spatial wilson loops .",
    "in particular we study the influence of the finite volume effect , the dyon - anti - dyon correlations as well as the screening mass on the confinement dynamics .",
    "some of these results are considerably improved as compared with previous studies and many new results have not been previously reported .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we present the details for our construction of the correlated instanton - dyon ensemble and the numerical procedures . our main results about the confinement dynamics in such an ensemble are reported in section 3 .",
    "th section 4 then focuses on examining the consequences of the key parameters in the ensemble construction .",
    "finally we conclude the study in section 5 .",
    "in addition a few appendices are included to explain some `` background '' information in details and to make the paper more self - contained for the convenience of readers .",
    "the construction of the partition function of the dyon ensemble begins with rewriting the one - loop quantum weight of the kvbll caloron in the limit of large dyon separation [ eq : z_kvbll3 ] ( refer to [ ap : kvbll , ap : kvbll_qw ] for more details ) , namely the contribution of a pair of @xmath5 and @xmath6 dyons , in the following way    @xmath7    here , the fugacities per dyon species are introduced as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "extending this result to arbitrary number of @xmath5 and @xmath6 dyons requires to include the appropriate metric of the moduli space .",
    "as it was found in @xcite , it turns out the new metric can be approximated by the square of the determinant of a symmetric matrix @xmath10 like @xmath11 , which in the @xmath12 case when the number of @xmath5 and @xmath6 dyons are respectively @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the dimension of @xmath10 is @xmath15 and its components are    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the position vector of the @xmath18 dyon of kind @xmath19 ( either @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for a single @xmath20 pair , the @xmath10 matrix reduces to @xmath21 ( [ eq : g_kvbll ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it should be clear that these results are analogous for antidyons .",
    "as it was pointed out in @xcite , dyon - antidyon configurations are not saddle points of the yang - mills action ; however , the inclusion of anti - selfdual fields in the ensemble is done by factorizing the measure into uncorrelated parts @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for dyons and @xmath24 for antidyons ) times a correlated contribution @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the action corresponding to dyon - antidyon interactions .",
    "classical interactions between dyon - antidyon of the same kind was recently introduced in a gradient flow study in @xcite .",
    "using the parametrization found in @xcite , the potential takes the form    @xmath27    for @xmath28 and @xmath29 . below the limit @xmath30 , the interaction is repulsive and the proposed core potential for this region",
    "is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a constant that is tuned for the simulation .",
    "another interaction that has to be accounted for is the long - range forces due to the abelian electric and magnetic charges and the nonlinear terms in the field strength tensor @xmath33 , given by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the electric and magnetic charges ( see [ tab : dyon_prop ] ) and @xmath37 for the @xmath6-type ( anti)dyons and -1 for the @xmath5-type ones .",
    "as expected , this gives null classical interaction between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 dyons , namely the kvbll caloron . on the other hand ,",
    "there is repulsive in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 channels , attractive for @xmath40 and @xmath41 and no interaction for the rest .    in the construction of the ensemble",
    ", one has to sum over different number of ( anti)dyons , therefore some terms will not be neutrally charged such as in a coulomb plasma . to account for",
    "the long range behavior of these interactions , one has regulate these terms by means of a screening debye mass @xmath42 .",
    "thus , all coulomb terms appearing in the ensemble ( including those in the @xmath10 matrices ) are rewritten as @xmath43 .    combining , the action contribution to the uncorrelated part of the partition function is found to be    @xmath44    now that the measure has been defined , the full partition function of the dyon - antidyon ensemble takes the form    @xmath45    where the factorial terms are introduced to avoid over counting of configurations .",
    "this expression can be further simplified under the assumption of equal number of dyons and antidyons of the same kind , reducing [ eq : part_func ] to    @xmath46}^2 e^{-vt^3\\mathcal{f}(t,\\nu)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the 3d volume available and    @xmath48}- v_{d\\bar{d } } { \\right\\rbrace}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is the integral of all the space dependent factors . finally , using stirling s approximation @xmath49 and defining the dimensionless dyon densities as @xmath50",

    "we believe this gives a more  realistic \" approach to the model and a more direct way to compare the results with such as lattice simulations which are also done on a @xmath53 geometry .    from [ eq : part_func2",
    "] , it can be seen that all explicit dependence on the temperature @xmath54 can be absorbed by rescaling @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the free energy @xmath58 .",
    "since this simplifies the calculations , all the simulations are done using the latter scaled variables . however , the temperature dependence is then defined through the running of the coupling constant in the caloron action @xmath59 , which at first loop approximation , is given by ( see [ ap : kvbll_qw ] )    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the scale parameter in the regularization . therefore , by varying @xmath59 as a parameter in the simulation , one can define @xmath61 at the observed critical point @xmath62 and then establish the temperature dependence of the observables as @xmath63 .",
    "the computation of all the observables are performed through monte carlo simulations using the well known metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "each configuration is generated by varying the 3d positions of a single ( anti)dyon of each kind ( accounting for the periodic boundary conditions ) , then apply the acceptance algorithm and in case of being accepted , move to the next set of dyons and repeat the procedure .",
    "once all positions have been accepted , we then move to compute the observables with that configuration and repeat all over again until the ensemble has been thermalized and we have significant statistics .",
    "it was found that after 1000 monte carlo configurations , the system was stabilized and the ensemble averages were calculated with 1500 subsequent configurations , for a total of 2500 .    when it comes to compute the measure factors @xmath64 , one has to notice that since it is an approximation to the actual moduli space metric , it may happen that some of the eigenvalues of the @xmath10 matrices be negative thus violating the positive definiteness of the metric .",
    "this issue has been addressed in detail by @xcite .",
    "to avoid configurations with negative eigenvalues in the simulations , the approach taken was using the metropolis - hastings algorithm to reject the configuration by assigning them a small statistical weight , i.e. if either @xmath65 or @xmath66 has at least one negative eigenvalue , then the weight @xmath67 is substituted by @xmath68 , which was found to be enough to create sufficient configurations with all positive eigenvalues .",
    "one of the most important quantities calculated was the holonomy potential or free energy density . due to the way its defined",
    ", the calculation through monte carlo is somehow tricky ; however , there is a common way to do this computation .",

    "<S> the mechanism of confinement in yang - mills theories remains a challenge to our understanding of nonperturbative gauge dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> while it is widely perceived that confinement may arise from chromo - magnetically charged gauge configurations with nontrivial topology , it is not clear what types of configurations could do that and how , in pure yang - mills and qcd - like ( non - supersymmetric ) theories . </S>",
    "<S> recently a promising approach has emerged , based on statistical ensembles of dyons / anti - dyons that are constituents of instanton / anti - instanton solutions with nontrivial holonomy where the holonomy plays a vital role as an effective `` higgsing '' mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we report a thorough numerical investigation of the confinement dynamics in su(2 ) yang - mills theory by constructing such a statistical ensemble of correlated instanton - dyons . </S>"
