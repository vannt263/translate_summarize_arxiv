    "many different methods have been used to solve the three - nucleon problem in the past .",
    "the most viable approach appears to be the faddeev method @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to solve the three - nucleon bound - state problem for various nucleon - nucleon potentials @xcite .",
    "the most complex calculations of this kind include up to 34 channels , when all the @xmath1 waves are taken into account .",
    "the precision achieved in these calculations is better than 1% @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when studying the properties of more complex nuclei one typically resorts to the shell model . in that approach ,",
    "the harmonic - oscillator basis is used in a truncated model space . instead of the free nucleon - nucleon potential ,",
    "one uses effective interactions inside the model space .",
    "examples of such calculations are the large - basis no - core shell - model calculations that have recently been performed @xcite . in these calculations",
    "all nucleons are active , which simplifies the effective interaction as no hole states are present .",
    "the effective interaction is determined for a system of two nucleons in a harmonic - oscillator well interacting by the nucleon - nucleon potential and is subsequently used in the many - particle calculations .    in the present paper",
    "we combine the application of the shell - model approach to the three - nucleon system with the faddeev method .",
    "we use faddeev s decomposition for the basis states and remove the center - of - mass term .",
    "this leads to a significant simplification of the problem and allows us to extend considerably the model space .",
    "we can study the convergence properties of the results with the increasing model space .",
    "if convergence is achieved , then this approach leads to the exact solution of the three - nucleon problem and is , thus , complementary to the traditional calculations , based on either the differential equation solutions in the configuration space or integral equation solitions in the momentum space treatments .",
    "in addition to the attempt of solving the three - nucleon problem exactly , the present method serves primarily as a test of the shell - model approach .",
    "in particular , it allows us to test effective interactions used in standard shell - model applications .",
    "the present approach has several advantages .",
    "first , any number of partial waves can be included .",
    "second , the calculation is simplified by using a compact formula for the matrix elements of the permutation operators in the harmonic - oscillator basis . also , because of the way we do the model - space truncation , we keep equivalence of the faddeev and schrdinger equations throughout the calculation .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss the shell - model hamiltonian with a bound center - of - mass , the faddeev equation , and the methods used to derive the starting - energy - independent effective interaction .",
    "results of the calculations for the three - nucleon system are presented in section [ sec3 ] . in particular , we discuss the harmonic - oscillator frequency and the model - space - size dependences .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in most shell - model studies the one- plus two - body hamiltonian for the a - nucleon system , i.e. , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the nucleon mass and @xmath4 the nucleon - nucleon interaction , is modified by adding the center - of - mass harmonic - oscillator potential @xmath5 , @xmath6",
    ". this potential does not influence intrinsic properties of the many - body system .",
    "it provides , however , a mean field felt by each nucleon and allows us to work with a convenient harmonic - oscillator basis .",
    "the modified hamiltonian , depending on the harmonic - oscillator frequency @xmath7 , can be cast into the form @xmath8 + \\sum_{i <",
    "j}^a \\left [ v_{\\rm n}(\\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j ) -\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2a } ( \\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j)^2 \\right ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] the one - body term of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) can be re - written as a sum of the center - of - mass term @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and a term depending on relative coordinates only . in the present application we use a basis , which explicitly separates center - of - mass and relative - coordinate wave functions .",
    "therefore , the center - of - mass term contribution is trivial and will be omitted from now on .",
    "for a three - nucleon system , i.e. , @xmath11 , the following transformation of the coordinates    [ rtrans ] @xmath12 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and , similarly , of the momenta    [ ptrans ] @xmath13    can be introduced that brings the relative - coordinate part of the one - body harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian into the form @xmath14 eigenstates of this hamiltonian , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the harmonic - oscillator quantum numbers corresponding to the harmonic oscillators associated with the coordinates and momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . the quantum numbers @xmath19 describe the spin , isospin and angular momentum of the relative - coordinate partial channel of particles 1 and 2 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the spin and isospin of the third particle , while @xmath22 is the angular momentum of the third particle relative to the center of mass of particles 1 and 2 .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the total angular momentum and the total isospin , respectively .",
    "note that for the @xmath25h nucleus @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the faddeev equation for the bound sytem can be written in the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the potential and @xmath31 , which has the properties of a metric operator @xcite , is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the cyclic and the anticyclic permutation operators , respectively .",
    "we derived a simple formula for the matrix elements of @xmath35 in the basis ( [ hobas ] ) , namely @xmath36 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) can be derived by examining the action of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the basis states ( [ hobas ] ) . a similar derivation for a different basis is described , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that the eigensystem of the metric @xmath31 ( [ metric ] ) consists of two subspaces .",
    "the first subspace has eigenstates with the eigenvalue 3 , which form totally antisymmetric physical states , while the second subspace has eigenstates with the eigenvalue 0 , which form a not completely antisymmetric , unphysical subspace of states .",
    "it is possible to hermitize the hamiltonian ( [ fadham ] ) on the physical subspace , where it is quasi - hermitian ( see the discussion of quasi - hermitian operators , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the hermitized hamiltonian takes the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 operates on the physical subspace only .",
    "apparently , the interaction @xmath42 is diagonal in the quantum numbers @xmath43 ( and also in @xmath44 due to the properties of the nucleon - nucleon potential ) .",
    "the metric @xmath31 ( [ metric ] ) is , on the other hand , diagonal in @xmath45 .",
    "note that any basis truncation other than one of the type @xmath46 violates , in general , the pauli principle and mixes physical and unphysical states . here",
    ", @xmath47 characterizes the maximum of total allowed harmonic - oscillator quanta in the model space and is an input parameter of the calculation . at the same time , the truncation into totally allowed oscillator quanta @xmath46 preserves the equivalence of the hamiltonians ( [ fadham ] ) and ( [ fadhamh ] ) on the physical subspace .    from solving two - nucleon systems in a harmonic - oscillator well , interacting by soft - core potentials , one learns that excitations up to about @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are required to get almost exact solutions .",
    "we anticipate , therefore , that at least the same number of excitations should be allowed to solve the three - nucleon system using the formalism discussed above .",
    "the faddeev formulation has the obvious advantage compared with the traditional shell - model approach that the center - of - mass coordinate is explicitly removed .",
    "even then , it is presently not feasible to solve the eigenvalue problem either for ( [ fadham ] ) or for ( [ fadhamh ] ) in such a large space . on the other hand ,",
    "shell - model calculations are always performed by employing effective interactions tailored to a specific model space . in practice , these effective interactions can never be calculated exactly as , in general , for an a - nucleon system the a - body effective interaction is required",
    ". consequently , large model spaces are desirable . in that case , the calculation should be less affected by any imprecision of the effective interaction .",
    "the same is true for the evaluation of any observable characterized by an operator . in the model space ,",
    "renormalized effective operators are required .",
    "the larger the model space , the less renormalization is needed .",
    "we may take advantage of the present approach to perform shell - model calculations in significantly larger model spaces than are possible in conventional shell - model approach , particularly when using a hermitized hamiltonian ( [ fadhamh ] ) . at the same time we can investigate convergence properties of effective interactions .",
    "if convergence is achieved , we should obtain the exact solution , since we recover the original full - space problem as @xmath50 , provided that the condition @xmath51 is satisfied in this limit .",
    "usually , the effective interaction is approximated by a two - body effective interaction determined from a two - nucleon system . in the present calculations we replace matrix elements of the potential @xmath42 by matrix elements of an effective two - body interaction , derived in a straightforward manner for",
    "each relative - coordinate partial channel .",
    "the relevant two - nucleon hamiltonian is then @xmath52 which can be solved as a differential equation or , alternatively , can be diagonalized in a sufficiently large harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the latter possibility is , obviously , not applicable for hard - core nucleon - nucleon potentials .    to construct the effective interaction",
    "we employ the lee - suzuki @xcite similarity transformation method , which gives the effective interaction in the form @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the transformation operator satisfying @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , the projectors on the model and the complementary spaces , respectively .",
    "our calculations start with exact solutions of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) and , consequently , we construct the operator @xmath54 and , then , the effective interaction directly from these solutions .",
    "let us denote the relative - coordinate two - nucleon harmonic - oscillator states , which form the model space , as @xmath58 , and those which belong to the q - space , as @xmath59 .",
    "then the q - space components of the eigenvector @xmath60 of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) can be expressed as a combination of the p - space components with the help of the operator @xmath54 @xmath61 if the dimension of the model space is @xmath62 , we may choose a set @xmath63 of @xmath62 eigenevectors , for which the relation ( [ eigomega ] ) will be satisfied . under the condition that the @xmath64 matrix @xmath65 for @xmath66 is invertible",
    ", the operator @xmath54 can be determined from ( [ eigomega ] ) . in the present application we select the lowest states obtained in each channel .",
    "their number is given by the number of basis states satisfying @xmath67 .",

    "this hamiltonian , when diagonalized in a model - space basis , reproduces exactly the set @xmath63 of @xmath62 eigenvalues @xmath70 .",
    "note that the effective hamiltonian is , in general , quasi - hermitian .",
    "it can be hermitized by a similarity transformation determined from the metric operator @xmath71 .",
    "the hermitian hamiltonian is then given by @xcite @xmath72^{1/2 } h_{\\rm 2eff}\\left[p(1+\\omega^\\dagger\\omega ) p\\right]^{-1/2 } \\ ; .\\ ] ] finally , the two - body effective interaction used in the present calculations is determined from the two - nucleon effective hamiltonian ( [ hermeffomega ] ) as @xmath73 .",
    "in this section we discuss the results of application of the formalism outlined in section [ sec2 ] for the @xmath25h system . in the calculations we use the nijmegen ii nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite corrected in the @xmath74 wave @xcite , and the reid93 nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite .",
    "we work in the isospin formalism ; the charge invariant potential @xmath75 is used for each @xmath76 wave @xcite .    the two - body effective interaction employed in the calculation",
    "is derived from the eqs .",
    "( [ eigomega])-([hermeffomega ] ) .",
    "our model space is characterized by the condition @xmath46 , @xmath45 .",
    "the condition for the relative - coordinate effective - interaction model space is then @xmath77 . when diagonalizing the two - nucleon relative - coordinate hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) in the full space we truncate the harmonic - oscillator basis by keeping only the states with @xmath78 .",
    "the error caused by this truncation can be estimated , as the system can be solved as a differential equation .",
    "we found that the low - lying eigenvalues obtained in the two calculations do not differ by more than @xmath79 mev and in most cases by much less .",
    "the lowest eigenvalues are typically of the order of @xmath80 mev .",
    "note that this error decreases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "we calculated the effective interactions up to @xmath81 , as required in the present aplication .",
    "once the effective interaction is found we may directly diagonalize the non - hermitian hamiltonian ( [ fadham ] ) in the basis ( [ hobas ] ) truncated by @xmath47 and with @xmath82 replaced by @xmath83 .    on the other hand , a calculation with the hermitized hamiltonian ( [ fadhamh ] )",
    "can be performed in three steps .",
    "first the effective interaction is calculated for each relative - coordinate partial channel .",
    "second the metric @xmath31 ( [ metric ] ) is diagonalized for each @xmath84 up to @xmath47 .",
    "the physical eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 3 are selected and used , finally , as a new basis in which the hamiltonian ( [ fadhamh ] ) is diagonalized . as the number of physical states is about a third of the number of all original basis states ( [ hobas ] ) ,",
    "it is more efficient to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ fadhamh ] ) than the non - hermitian hamiltonian ( [ fadham ] ) , in particular for higher values of @xmath47 . in fact , for @xmath85 we used the hermitian hamiltonian only .",
    "note that the hamiltonians ( [ fadham ] ) and ( [ fadhamh ] ) have identical spectra of the physical states , provided that no other truncation than @xmath86 is allowed .",
    "the unphysical eigenstates of @xmath87 ( [ fadham ] ) have energies corresponding to the unperturbed harmonic oscillator , starting at @xmath88 .    in figs . [ figniie]-[figr93r ]",
    "we present the results for the ground - state energies and point - nucleon radii , calculated from @xmath89 , obtained with the nijmegen ii and the reid93 nucleon - nucleon potentials , respectively .",
    "our calculation starts at @xmath90 , which corresponds to a model space easily accessible with the traditional shell - model calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite we performed an @xmath91 calculation for @xmath25h using a slightly different effective interaction than we employ here but derived in an analogous way .",
    "note that it is straightforward to transform the relative - coordinate effective interaction used in the present calculations to the two - particle basis used for the shell - model input by the standard transformation @xcite .",
    "we used the transformed interaction in the @xmath91 space to test our results .",
    "the shell - model diagonalization was performed by using the many - fermion - dynamics shell - model code @xcite and we obtain the same answers from both the present calculation and the shell - model calculation .",
    "the present calculation has , obviously , much smaller dimension .",
    "as the results depend on @xmath47 and @xmath7 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ hamomega ] ) , we must test the convergence with regard to both of these parameters . with increasing @xmath47",
    "the calculations grow tedious .",
    "we performed the calculations up to @xmath81 for a wide range of the harmonic - oscillator frequencies @xmath7 with values typical for standard shell - model calculations varying from @xmath92 mev to @xmath93 mev .",
    "in general , we observe a slow convergence with increasing @xmath47 .",
    "an unusual feature is the convergence from below .",
    "this is caused by the use of effective interactions instead of the free nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the effective interactions we employ are too strong .",
    "we have not reached the convergence with respect to @xmath7 in the whole range studied . however , for the values @xmath94 mev our results almost reach convergence with @xmath81 , in particular for the reid93 potential .",
    "we note that the traditional 34-channel faddeev calculation , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , gives the binding energies 7.62 mev and 7.63 mev for the nijmegen ii and the reid93 nucleon - nucleon potentials , respectively .",
    "we present these values in figs .",
    "[ figniie ] , and [ figr93e ] as dotted lines for comparison . from the figures it is apparent that we are obtaining virtually the same values in the calculations which start to converge . when comparing the results for the two different potentials used we can see larger sensitivity to @xmath7 of the reid93 calculation .",
    "on the other hand , the calculation using the nijmegen ii potential is slower in reaching the stability with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "while the ground - state energy calculation begins to stabilize for the largest values of @xmath7 employed , the radius calculation has not reached complete stability for any of the @xmath7 values within the model spaces we used .    as a further test on the stability and convergence of the method we analyzed the ground - state wave functions and calculated the probability of @xmath95 states . in fig .",
    "[ figwave ] we show the @xmath96-state and @xmath97-state probabilities as a function of @xmath47 for the reid93 calculations with @xmath98 and 24 mev .",
    "we observe a good stability with respect to @xmath47 and little dependence on @xmath7 for larger model spaces .",
    "the @xmath96-state probability approaches @xmath99 , @xmath97-state probability percentage reaches @xmath100 . not shown in the figure are the calculated @xmath56-state and @xmath101-state percentage probabilities , for which we get @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the present numbers are in agreement with those obtained using other nucleon - nucleon potentials @xcite .",
    "the @xmath96-state percentage is approximately 1.5 times the corresponding @xmath96-state percentage of deuteron ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "in addition to the calculations discussed so far , we also computed properties of @xmath25he , with the focus on obtaining the binding - energy difference between @xmath25h and @xmath25he . in those calculations",
    "the coulomb potential was added to the proton - proton potential and the averaged potential @xmath105 was eventually used for each @xmath76 wave @xcite .",

    "it decreaces with @xmath47 in correlation with increasing point - nucleon radius and approaches 0.66 mev .",
    "this result is again in agreement with those obtained using other nucleon - nucleon potentials @xcite .",
    "note that the experimental value of the binding - energy difference is 0.764 mev . to test the quality of the approximation used for the potential averaging and limitation to @xmath106",
    ", we performed an @xmath90 calculation with complete isopin breaking using proton - neutron formalism .",
    "the present method can be used to perform calculations with isospin breaking . for this particular calculation , however , we employed the many - fermion - dynamics shell - model code .",
    "the effective interaction was calculated separately for the proton - proton and proton - neutron systems , respectively , and transformed to the two - particle basis as discussed earlier in this section . in this way we found that the binding energy obtained with and without isospin breaking differs by 11 kev and the nucleon radius differs by less than 0.001 fm in a calculation with @xmath98 mev .",
    "this confirms , that the limitation to @xmath106 together with the potential averaging provides an excellent approximation .",
    "we stressed before that no other basis truncation than @xmath86 was used .",
    "that means that we keep all the relative - coordinate channels in the basis . in most calculations",

    "we also performed calculations with @xmath107 set to zero for @xmath109 .",
    "the largest contribution of the @xmath110 waves to the binding energy we observed was about 5 kev .",
    "this contribution increases with @xmath47 and @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we performed several calculations with @xmath107 non - zero up to @xmath111 , and found that the ground - state energy is affected by less than 0.3 kev compared to the @xmath112 calculations .",
    "note that such a truncation of @xmath107 does not imply that @xmath113 , see eq .",
    "( [ fadham ] ) . also , this type of potential truncation is not the same as used in the traditional faddeev calculations @xcite .",
    "the difference is , that there is no truncation in the treatment of @xmath31 ( [ metric ] ) in the present calculations .",
    "it should be noted that the calculated binding energy obtained from calculations employing nucleon - nucleon potentials fitted to the two - nucleon scattering underbind @xmath25h by about 0.8 mev , as its experimental binding energy is 8.48 mev . suggested solutions to this problem",

    "@xcite that the 34-channel standard faddeev calculation converged within 0.01 mev .",
    "we have seen , in fact , that the higher partial waves of the nucleon - nucleon interaction are not significant . however , we believe a proper treatment of the metric operator ( [ metric ] ) is important .",
    "we observed that the convergence was rather slow with some dependence on the type of the nucleon - nucleon potential . in smaller model spaces we can not reproduce correctly the ground - state energy and the radius at the same time for any choice of @xmath7 .",
