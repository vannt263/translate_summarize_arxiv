    "@xcite have reported a potential gapped phase at intermediate @xmath6 and @xmath27 . despite considerable transport and capacitance data already available ,",
    "however , a unified framework for understanding the diverse competing phases has not yet emerged .",
    "the failure can be traced to the fact that little direct information is available from @xmath17 , which is sensitive only to absence of presence of insulating phases .",

    "positive and negative @xmath18 thus corresponds to preferentially filling one or the other of the two inequivalent valleys .",
    "strikingly , at high magnetic fields the @xmath18 measurements fall into what appear to be discrete signal levels , corresponding to blue , cyan , orange , and red on the color scale of fig .",
    "2b .    to understand the color scale more quantitatively , we compute the absolute layer polarization of the eight single - particle eigenstates that comprise the zll manifold . we write",
    "valley / orbital / spin wavefunctions as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 denoting the two valleys , @xmath31 the orbital quantum number , and @xmath32 the electron spin . working in a four - band tight - binding model that accounts for the electron - hole asymmetry of the bilayer graphene band structure ( @xmath20 )",
    ", we write the zll wavefunctions explicitly in the sublattice basis , @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 wavefunctions are fully layer polarized ( which we denote by @xmath35 ) , with @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes a conventional lowest - ll orbital .",
    "the @xmath38 state is similarly layer polarized but with opposite polarization ( see fig .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath39 wavefunction is also supported on the high energy , dimerized sublattices , so that e.g. @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "consequently , the @xmath39 states have only incomplete layer polarization @xmath41 .",
    "this effect again can be traced to the role of @xmath20 and the particle - hole asymmetry of the single particle band structure ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "it grows linearly with magnetic field , with a calculated@xcite value of @xmath42 at 31 t .",
    "we thus interpret red , orange , blue and cyan as indicating regions where the fermi level lies within the @xmath43 , or @xmath44 lls , respectively . to analyze the data , we assume a simple level - filling picture . armed with this ansatz , fig .",
    "2b becomes a road map to both valley and orbital ordering in the zll .",
    "the polarization of gapped states , for example , can be read off by summing the level filling sequence starting from the empty , @xmath45 vacuum , and reading from left to right . at @xmath27 , for example , five states are evident , three of which ( high , low , and intermediate @xmath46 ) are distinct ( fig .",
    "2d ) . the high @xmath46 gapped state ( phase i ) is constructed by filling the @xmath47 , @xmath48,@xmath49 , and @xmath50 in sequence , where @xmath51 for positive / negative @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting state has full valley polarization but is necessarily orbitally and spin - unpolarized ( fig .",
    "2d ) due to the pauli exclusion principle . at intermediate @xmath46 , in contrast ,",
    "the gapped @xmath27 state is partially polarized in both valley and orbital subspaces .",
    "near @xmath25 , the gapped state is both valley and orbitally unpolarized , consistent with the canted antiferromagnetic state previously argued for in the literature@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram revealed by @xmath18 , however , is much richer than can be anticipated from the gapped states alone , which are already visible in conventional capacitance@xcite and transport @xcite measurements . between @xmath52 and @xmath27 , for example",
    ", seven phase transitions are visible in @xmath18 while only 4 are visible in the gapped state at charge neutrality .",
    "@xmath18 data thus put much more stringent constraints on theoretical models , allowing inclusion of a larger array of potential symmetry breaking mechanisms without the fitting process becoming underconstrained .",
    "we start our analysis with the single particle energy spectrum , in which spin , valley , and orbital degeneracies ( see fig .",
    "3a ) are already lifted .",
    "the single - particle energies are @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the potential difference across the bilayer induced by @xmath6 , @xmath55.11 b / tesla  mev is the zeeman energy , and @xmath56 9.7  mev is the @xmath57 splitting of the orbital degeneracy at b=31 t , which originates in the particle - hole asymmetry of the zero - magnetic field band structure . for a given value of @xmath54 , a purely single - particle model sequentially fills these levels , starting from the lowest energy state@xmath58 for @xmath59 , for example  at @xmath45 , as shown in the top panel of figure 3b .",
    "the single particle model produces numerous phase transitions at integer fillings , providing a qualitative match to @xmath17 and transport data@xcite",
    ".    however , the single - particle picture immediately fails to account for the @xmath18 data , starting at @xmath60 , as is evident from comparing the lower panel of fig . 3b and the experimental data in fig .",
    "2b . in the large , negative @xmath6 regime",
    ", the noninteracting model predicts that n=0 orbital states should fill in sequence : @xmath61 fills immediately after @xmath58 due to the comparative weakness of the zeeman effect , @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "3b ) . experimentally ,",
    "in contrast , we find that @xmath63 fills between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( fig 2b ) .",
    "the discrepancy arises from the failure to account for coulomb interactions , which favor sequential filling of @xmath66 levels within the same spin and valley@xcite . letting @xmath67 denote the exchange energy to fill two @xmath34 levels of orthogonal isospin , and @xmath68 the energy for filling @xmath69 levels of the same isospin , our numerical calculations find @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the in - plane dielectric constant",
    ", @xmath72 is the magnetic length at @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the elementary charge ( see methods ) .",
    "we model this effect by assuming that , having filled @xmath58 state , for example , the energy cost of occupying its empty isospin pair , @xmath63 , is reduced by @xmath75 relative to the other unoccupied states .",
    "this effect dramatically reorders the level filling sequence ( fig .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is highly sensitive to the strength of the coulomb interactions , controlled by @xmath71 : for interactions too weak , the model reduces to the single particle limit , while in the opposite limit , the orbital pairing is too strong to realize the orbitally polarized phases observed at low @xmath46 and @xmath65 , for example ( fig 3d ) . to fit the experimental data , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are fixed from band structure@xcite , leaving only the bilayer dielectric constants , @xmath78 and @xmath71 , as free parameters .",
    "only a narrow range of @xmath79 and @xmath8010 - 11.4 give a qualitative match ( see methods for full description of fitting procedure ) .",
    "the large values of the dielectric constants imply significant contributions from both filled and empty lls to the screening properties of the bilayer .",
    "symmetry breaking in bilayer graphene is controlled by a delicate competition between electron - hole asymmetry of the band structure , which gives rise to @xmath77 and favors orbitally polarized states , and coulomb interactions , which favor orbital doublet states .",
    "our model is successful in accounting for the correct number and character of phases and transitions in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 data .",
    "however , it fails to capture some features of the data , and we devote the remainder of this article to exploring these discrepancies and their implications . the first quantitative failure is the asymmetry in the critical @xmath6 for transitions at @xmath81 evident in the data but absent in the model .",
    "we attribute the asymmetry to density dependence of intrinsic screening within the bilayer . unlike screening from the boron nitride dielectric ( @xmath82 ) , intrinsic screening may give @xmath23-dependent corrections@xcite to both @xmath71 and @xmath78 which we do not account for . a large contribution to screening from filled electron bands is consistent with the enhancements of @xmath78 and @xmath71 over their bare values that follows from our fits .",
    "our remaining analysis focuses on @xmath83 to minimize the systematic errors arising from this effect .",
    "the domain of stability of the observed phases are also quantitatively skewed near @xmath27 as compared with the model .",
    "the sign of this effect , which suggests a larger - than zeeman spin anisotropy , is consistent with contributions arising from valley anisotropies known to strongly affect charge and spin order near charge neutrality@xcite .",
    "correlations giving rise to canted antiferromagnetism , combined with density dependent screening are likely also responsible for anomalous tilted field behavior of the @xmath84 phase transitions shown in supplementary figure s3 .",
    "disentangling the interplay between spin degrees of freedom near @xmath27 will be the focus of future work .",
    "most strikingly , however , the model outlined in fig .",
    "3 also fails to explain a major _ qualitative _ feature of the data : the large slope in the @xmath85 plane associated with many of the transitions throughout the phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "a sloped phase transition in the @xmath86 plane implies that the difference in energy per particle in the two competing phases must depend on the total number of particles .",
    "are thus intrinsically correlation effects . one possible source of this effect is the energy cost of charging the bilayer capacitor itself , @xmath87 , however this effect produces a small slope with sign opposite to that observed experimentally .",
    "moreover , the @xmath23-dependence of the transitions is strongest where occupation is being transferred between @xmath34 and @xmath39 orbitals , which are differentiated by exchange physics@xcite but not strongly by layer polarization , pointing to correlation physics beyond the capacitive effect .     near @xmath65 .",
    "sign changes in @xmath18 as a function of @xmath5 indicate polarization extrema and phase transitions .",
    "the strong dependence of the phase transition lines on @xmath23 are unexplained by the nearly single particle model of fig .",

    "additional @xmath94 curves are shown in supplementary figure s6 .",
    "the lack of quantitative agreement for a four band , screened interaction model is likely due to our neglect of ll - mixing , which leads to dynamic screening and a complex microscopic interaction beyond the scope of current numerical methods@xcite .",

    "the metallic gates , each at distance @xmath183 nm from the bilayer , induce an infinite series of image charges which screen the interaction down to a quadrupolar @xmath184 falloff for @xmath185 .",
    "as far as correlations are concerned we can neglect the finite width of the bilayer itself , which is an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath186 . in this case",
    "we can fourier transform the gate - screened potential in 2 dimensions to obtain @xmath187 , where we express @xmath173 in units of @xmath188 and the length scales @xmath189 and @xmath190 in units of @xmath186 .",
    "we work only with the eight zll components by projecting the coulomb interaction into this subspace , justified by the smallness of the coulomb scale compared with the ll - level spacing .",
    "we also completely neglect the small valley anisotropies which break the valley - su(2 ) symmetry , though they play an important role in determining the spin - physics near @xmath191@xcite .",
    "the valley anisotropy is of order @xmath192 , which is small compared to the exchange physics of the non - caf transitions we will focus on , though it is comparable to the zeeman energy .    under these assumptions we have the su(4)-isospin symmetric interaction @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the total density .",
    "each density @xmath195 is _ not _ diagonal in the orbital index @xmath152 , but instead involves orbital - mixing contributions : @xmath196 here @xmath197 is a guiding - center density operator and @xmath198 are the blg ` form factors , ' which can be expressed in terms of the conventional quadratic - band form factors @xmath199 as @xmath200 note that the @xmath201 are independent of @xmath168 , since to leading order in @xmath54 the @xmath202 wavefunctions differ only by a permutation of the sites . in the four - band model , we refer to eqs.- to find @xmath203 thus the interaction is parameterized by @xmath204 . in this convention , @xmath205 , where @xmath206 at @xmath20731 t . when @xmath208 is small , i.e. at low perpendicular magnetic fields , the @xmath152=a states are full polarized and the problem reduces to the two - band model @xmath209 equivalent to conventional quadratic - band ll - mixing .",
    "having assumed su(4)-isospin invariant interactions and packaged the dielectric response of filled @xmath210 isospin components into the static dielectric constant @xmath71 , we can map the required calculations to the low @xmath6 transition on the density interval @xmath211 . since spin remains completely polarized across the transition , we label the isospin only by its valley @xmath212 .",
    "su(4 ) symmetry allows us to assign separately conserved fillings @xmath213 , @xmath214 to the two valleys .",
    "however , due to orbital - mixing , we can not separate @xmath215 into its @xmath69 components , since the coulomb interaction scatters particles between them .",
    "the degree of this ` orbital - mixing ' is parameterized by @xmath216 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : kappa ] ) .",
    "as in the main text , we rewrite @xmath99 in this regime .",

    "the exchange energies of the competing phases defined in fig . 4 of the main text can then be written as @xmath226    we compute @xmath227 using the infinite - dmrg method . in the infinite - dmrg method we place the quantum hall problem on an infinitely long cylinder of circumference @xmath228 . when computing @xmath229 it is necessary to keep _ two _ components , @xmath230 , due to the orbital - mixing at any partial filling .",
    "computing @xmath231 requires keeping _ four _ components - @xmath232 , because the @xmath219 and @xmath220 valleys interact through the density - density interaction , and the @xmath233 component acts as a polarizable medium due to the small splitting @xmath77 .",
    "orbital mixing is thus fully accounted for.@xcite in principle each @xmath234 has a delicate @xmath23-dependence sensitive to all the fractional competing phases ( which may be distinguished at the level of @xmath235 or @xmath236 ) , requiring finite - scaling analysis to fully resolve .",
    "however , given the resolution of the present experiment , we focus on the much larger and slowly varying background ( at the level of @xmath237 ) .",
    "for this purpose we can work on cylinders of circumference @xmath238 and use a dmrg - bond dimension of @xmath239 , which results in an error in the energy per particle in the 4th - digit , much smaller than the experimental features to be modeled .",
    "our i - dmrg implements particle conservation in each valley , @xmath240 , which allows us to specify @xmath241 in order to find the ground state in either the @xmath242 and @xmath243 sector .",
