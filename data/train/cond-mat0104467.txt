    "extinction seems to be the final outcome of the evolution of species . in fact , as species survive about 10 million years in the average , nearly all species that have ever existed are extinct and only a very small fraction of them have left their impressions in the fossil record @xcite .",
    "the causes of the mass extinction events is currently a matter of dispute as there are two main types of explanations @xcite .",
    "the more traditional one asserts that extinction is caused by external stresses as , for instance , major climate changes and asteroids impacts .",
    "this point of view is supported by some evidences such as the unusual quantity of iridium and other noble metals in the rocks that marked the boundary between the cretaceous and tertiary periods , when the era of the dinosaurs was replaced by the era of the mammals @xcite .",
    "since iridium is more common in asteroids than in the earth s crust , this finding can be viewed as evidence for an asteroid impact .",
    "the alternative explanation asserts that extinctions are caused by the interactions between the species in the ecosystems .",
    "in particular , paine @xcite has shown that species richness sometimes can be increased by the predator - mediated coexistence , and the removal of predators can lead to additional species extinctions .",
    "some recent studies indicate that food webs with many species or high connectivity are more likely to lose species as a consequence of the extinction of a single species when compared with more simple food webs @xcite .",
    "although this kind of argument seems well suited to explain the so - called background extinctions , it certainly needs some new ingredients to explain mass extinctions as well .",
    "in fact , the missing ingredient seems to be the self - organized criticality concept @xcite , which in this context is best illustrated by the popular bak - sneppen model @xcite . according to this model",
    ", the fitness of each species is affected by the other species to which it is coupled in the ecosystem so that large events in the evolutionary history may be thought of as large coevolutionary avalanches caused by the intrinsic dynamics of the model . in this model , the distribution of the extinction sizes follows a power law , which is a valid candidate for fitting to the experimental data .",
    "although we recognize that evolution and hence extinction are , as pictured by the models mentioned above , essentially dynamical phenomena , in this work we study these phenomena within the equilibrium statistical mechanics framework of the random replicator model for species coevolution @xcite .",
    "deterministic replicator models are commonly used to describe the evolution of self - reproducing entities in a variety of fields such as game theory , prebiotic evolution and sociobiology @xcite . the random replicator model introduced by diederich and opper",
    "@xcite attempts to model the uncertainties and the overwhelming complexity of the interspecies interactions in biological ecosystems by assuming that those interactions are random .",
    "however , it is also assumed that the dynamics is such that a fitness functional ( lyapunov function ) is maximized so that the only stationary states are fixed points .",
    "in fact , the existence of such a functional leads to a replicator equation with symmetric interspecies interactions @xcite which is a severe assumption from the biological standpoint .",
    "it allows , however , full use of tools of the equilibrium statistical mechanics to study analytically the average properties of the equilibrium states of this kind of disordered ecosystems .",
    "an interesting result of the random replicator model is that in the equilibrium state a fraction of the species is extinct @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of extinction is clearly outcompetition and , in the absence of any cooperation pressure , only the pair of species with the largest reinforcing interactions will thrive . in this contribution we study the effects of random elimination of a fixed fraction of the species at the outset of the evolutionary process , giving emphasis to the distribution of the remaining species concentrations in the equilibrium state .",
    "there are several interesting issues that can be addressed in this framework .",
    "for instance , what is the equilibrium situation when the fraction of species eliminated at the beginning is already larger than the fraction that would be extinct naturally due to outcompetition ?",
    "furthermore , how does the ecosystem cope with large initial extinction events ? in this paper",
    "we give clear - cut analytic answers to these questions which are partly corroborated by numerical simulations of the model ecosystem .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level2 ] we introduce the model and discuss the ecological interpretation of the control parameters .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the model are derived within the replica - symmetric framework in sec .",
    "[ sec : level3 ] and the use of the reciprocal of the edwards - anderson order parameter as a measure for the diversity of the ecosystem is suggested . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level4 ] we calculate the distribution of probability of the concentrations of a given species , allowing thus the explicit calculation of the ecosystem diversity as the fraction of surviving species at equilibrium . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : level5 ] we present some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider an infinite population ( ecosystem ) composed of individuals belonging to @xmath0 different species whose fitness @xmath1 are the derivatives @xmath2 of the fitness functional @xmath3 defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fraction of species @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a quenched random variable that takes the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 with probabilities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "hence @xmath12 randomly chosen species are eliminated at the outset in the average and so henceforth we will refer to @xmath13 $ ] as the dilution parameter .",
    "an effective competition among the species is enforced by requiring that the concentrations of the surviving species satisfy the constraint @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an arbitrary positive constant which gives the scale of the concentrations @xmath16 .",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath17 between species @xmath6 and @xmath18 are statistically independent quenched random variables with a gaussian distribution @xmath19\\ ] ] so that @xmath20 corresponds to pairs of cooperating species while @xmath21 to pairs of competing species .",
    "the self - interaction parameter @xmath22 acts as a global cooperation pressure limiting the growth of any single species , and it is crucial to guarantee the existence of a nontrivial thermodynamic limit , @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , for large @xmath24 the minimum of @xmath25 corresponds to a homogeneous ecosystem where the surviving species have concentrations @xmath26 .",
    "the positive self - interactions means that individuals of a same species compete against themselves , which is quite reasonable as they certainly share the same resources ( ecological niche ) .",
    "the time evolution of the species concentrations is given by the replicator equation @xmath27   \\forall i\\ ] ] which minimizes @xmath28 while keeping the term @xmath29 constant during the evolution .",
    "hence the fixed points of this equation are the minima of @xmath28 and in the following we use the replica formalism to study analytically the statistical properties of these minima .",
    "following the standard prescription of performing quenched averages on extensive quantities only @xcite , we define the average free - energy density @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the partition function and @xmath33 is the inverse temperature . taking the limit @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ z0 ] ) ensures that only the states that minimize @xmath35 will contribute to @xmath36 .",
    "we impose the additional constraint @xmath37 to avoid divergences when carrying out the integrals over @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath38 stands for the average over the coupling strengths @xmath17 as well as over the auxiliary variables @xmath39 . as usual , the evaluation of the quenched average in eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) can be carried out through the replica method : using the identity @xmath40 we first calculate @xmath41 for _ integer _",
    "@xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 , and then analytically continue to @xmath44 .",
    "the final result is @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 we note that while we have calculated the average over the couplings @xmath17 explicitly , we have used the self - averaging property @xmath49 to eliminate the site dependence of the @xmath39 variables .",
    "the relevant physical order parameters are @xmath50 which measure the overlap between a pair of different equilibrium states @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the overlap of an equilibrium state @xmath51 with itself , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath53 stands for a thermal average taken with the gibbs probability distribution @xmath54 .\\ ] ] to proceed further we assume that the saddle - point parameters are symmetric under permutations of the replica indices , i.e. , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . with this prescription the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ f_gen ] ) is straightforward yielding the following replica - symmetric free energy density @xmath61 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the gaussian measure .",
    "already at this stage we can see that the concentration of species eliminated at the outset , given by the parameter @xmath64 , decouples from the other physical parameters and hence does not have any effect upon them .",
    "in the zero - temperature limit the saddle - point equations @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 we note that the parameter associated to the concentration of surviving species @xmath15 appears only as a scale of @xmath71 and so henceforth we will set @xmath72 without loss of generality . in the replica - symmetric framework the edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath71",
    "is defined by @xmath73 if the concentrations @xmath16 were normalized to @xmath9 rather than to @xmath0 then @xmath71 would give the probability that two randomly selected individuals are of the same species , a quantity known as simpson s index @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can still give a simple physical interpretation to @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , values of @xmath71 of order of @xmath9 indicate the coexistence of a macroscopic number of species ( i.e. , @xmath74 for an extensive number of species ) , while large values of @xmath71 signalize the dominance of a few species only ( i.e. , @xmath75 for a finite number of species ) . of course , this interpretation is equivalent to that given above for simpson s index , and so we can view @xmath76 as a measure of the diversity of the ecosystem . in fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] we present @xmath76 as a function of the dilution parameter @xmath10 for several values of the cooperation pressure @xmath24 .",
    "the results of the numerical solution of the replicator equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rep ] ) , for @xmath77 are also presented .",
    "each data point is the average over @xmath78 realizations of the matrix of coupling strengths , starting with an uniform distribution of concentrations .",
    "since the labeling of the species is arbitrary we can set @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 otherwise , without loss of generality .",
    "in addition , we choose @xmath10 such that @xmath82 is integer for simplicity . in agreement with our interpretation , for @xmath10 close to @xmath9",
    "we can observe the vanishing of @xmath76 , which characterizes an ecosystem composed of a few species only .",
    "for small values of @xmath24 the analytical results show the existence of a maximum of diversity for a nonzero value of the dilution parameter ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] ) ; the numerical results however do not corroborate this finding .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the instability of the replica - symmetric solution .",
    "in fact , carrying out the standard local stability analysis @xcite , we find that this solution is locally stable wherever the condition @xmath83 is satisfied .",
    "figure [ fig : at ] shows the regions in the plane @xmath84 where the replica - symmetric solution is stable .",
    "in particular , we find that for @xmath85 this solution is stable for @xmath86 while for @xmath87 it is stable for @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the maxima observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] are indeed artifacts of the replica - symmetry framework .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement between the analytical and numerical results is already excelent for @xmath89 .",
    "the rather puzzling independence of the diversity on the dilution parameter for small @xmath24 has a simple explanation as will be seen in the next section .",
    "although the interpretation of the reciprocal of the edwards - anderson order parameter as the ecosystem diversity yields some information on the distribution of species at equilibrium , a better understanding is achieved by calculating explicitly the probability distribution that the concentration of one of the @xmath90 remaining species , say @xmath91 , assumes the value @xmath92 , defined by @xmath93 with @xmath94 given by eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) . as all non - vanishing species concentrations are equivalent we can write @xmath95 . hence to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ prob_x ] ) we introduce the auxiliary energy @xmath96 so that @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the partition function ( [ z0 ] ) with @xmath99 replaced by @xmath100 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ der ] ) the calculations needed to evaluate @xmath101 become analogous to those used in the evaluation of the free - energy density ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , to handle a possible singularity in the limit @xmath102 it is more convenient to deal with the cumulative distribution function @xmath103 . carrying out the calculations within the replica - symmetric framework we obtain @xmath104 \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are given by the saddle - point equations ( [ sp1])-([sp3 ] ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : cx_0.8 ] we show @xmath107 for @xmath108 and several values of @xmath10 .",
    "the first point to note is that @xmath109 yields the fraction of surviving species at the outset , as expected .",
    "in addition , a nonzero value of @xmath110 indicates that the probability distribution @xmath111 has a delta peak at @xmath112 and so @xmath110 actually yields the fraction of the species that survived the initial externally induced extinction event but that were extinct later on due to outcompetition . in the regime of large dilution ,",
    "say @xmath113 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cx_0.8 ] , the cumulative distribution is very small and practically constant for small concentrations , indicating that no further extinctions have taken place and , furthermore , that rare species are very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem at equilibrium .",
    "we note that the numerical simulations yield results practically indistinguishable from the analytical ones .",
    "the rough independence of the diversity @xmath76 on the dilution parameter @xmath10 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] for small @xmath24 is easily understood with the aid of the cumulated distributions .",
    "in fact , a direct measure of the ecosystem diversity is given by the fraction of surviving species @xmath114 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c0 ] as function of @xmath10 .",
    "( we recall that @xmath10 is the fraction of species that were extinct at the outset due to some external stress and @xmath110 is the fraction that died out due to outcompetition . ) the remarkable similarity between these figures corroborates our interpretation of @xmath76 as a measure of the diversity .",
    "clearly , the diversity is insensitive to variations of @xmath10 whenever the fraction of extinct species in the undisturbed ecosystem ( i.e. @xmath110 calculated at @xmath85 ) is already considerably larger than @xmath10 , so that the species eliminated at the outset would probably be extinct later on anyway .",
    "although the dynamics of the random replicator model may not look very appealing , in the sense that it always leads to fixed points , the frustration caused by the competition between the concentration limiting self - interactions ( @xmath115 ) and the tendency to unlimited growth of pairs of strongly cooperative ( @xmath20 ) species results in a highly nontrivial equilibrium , characterized by many meta - stable states @xcite and a phase of replica symmetry breaking @xcite . of course , these very features make some aspects of the dynamics ( e.g. , slow relaxation and hysteresis effects ) nontrivial as well .",
    "the wealth of ecologically relevant issues that can be addressed within this equilibrium framework can be appreciated , for instance , in the case of high - order interactions among the species where it has been reported the emergence of a threshold value which gives a lower bound to the concentration of the surviving species , preventing then the existence of rare ( low concentration ) species in the ecosystem @xcite .",
    "an important outcome of the equilibrium analysis of the random replicator model is the finding that in order to reduce the degree of frustration a fraction of the species dies out @xcite .",
    "this type of extinction has clearly a biotic cause , namely , outcompetition @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study how the model ecosystem copes with abiotic or externally induced extinction , in which a fraction of randomly chosen species is eliminated at the beginning of the coevolutionary process .",
    "we find that in the regime of high competition ( small @xmath24 ) the ecosystem diversity , i.e. , the fraction of surviving species is practically insensitive to the strength @xmath10 of the initial extinction provided it is not too large , while in the less competitive regime ( large @xmath24 ) the diversity decreases linearly with increasing @xmath10 . in the case of a large extinction event we find that no further ( biotic ) extinctions take place and , furthermore , that rare species become very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem at equilibrium .",
    "this is distinct from the result mentioned above for the case of high - order interactions where the probability of finding rare species in the ecosystem is strictly null @xcite .",
    "an interesting by - product of our investigation is the finding that the reciprocal of the edwards - anderson order parameter ( i.e. , the replica - symmetric overlap between two equilibrium states ) serves as an easy - to - calculate measure of the diversity of the model ecosystem .",
    "this opens the exciting possibility of interpreting the different hierarquical levels of the overlap order parameter in the full replica symmetry breaking scheme @xcite as different levels of a phylogenetic tree that gives the relations of dependence ( viewed as ancestrality ) among the species .",
