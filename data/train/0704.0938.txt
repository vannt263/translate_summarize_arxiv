    "if we take @xmath94 , the nucleating droplets almost always occur one to two monte carlo steps per spin later than for @xmath91 .",
    "the reason is that the linear size of the nucleating droplet  is typically 6 to @xmath95 , and its center of mass might shift more than @xmath96 during the time @xmath88 . if such a shift occurs , a cluster that would be said to grow for @xmath91 would not be counted as such because it did not satisfy the center of mass criterion .",

    "a reasonable choice of @xmath89 is 20% to 40% of the linear size of the nucleating droplet .",
    "the choice of parameters is particularly important here because the rate of growth of the transient nucleating droplets is slower than the growth rate of droplets formed after metastable equilibrium has been reached .",

    "because nucleation studies are computationally intensive , we used a novel algorithm for simulating ising models with a uniform long - range interaction  @xcite .",

    "we next determined @xmath180 , the number of clusters of size @xmath25 at time @xmath10 after the temperature quench .",
    "because all the spins are up at @xmath150 , the number of ( down ) clusters of size @xmath25 begins at zero and increases to its ( apparent ) equilibrium value @xmath181 .",
    "the value of the latter depends on the size of the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : metrop_ns_100_multiexp_t269_up ] shows the evolution of clusters of size @xmath182 for one run . because we know of no argument for the time dependence of @xmath183 except in the mean - field limit  @xcite , we have to rely on empirical fits .",
    "we find that the time - dependence of @xmath180 can be fitted to the sum of two exponentials , @xmath184 where @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 are parameters to be fitted with @xmath189 .",
    "figure  [ fig15a ] shows the relaxation time @xmath188 as a function of @xmath25 for @xmath32 at @xmath190 starting from @xmath168 .",
    "note that the bigger the cluster , the longer it takes to reach its equilibrium distribution .",
    "that is , small clusters form first , and larger clusters are formed by the merging of smaller ones .",
    "the @xmath25-dependence of @xmath188 can be approximately fitted to a power law with the exponent 0.4 .    to prepare a configuration at @xmath191 ,",
    "the system is randomized with approximately half of the spins up and half of the spins down .",
    "the temperature is instantaneously changed to @xmath192 .",
    "as before , we focus on the relaxation of down spin clusters .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath171 case , the evolution of the clusters falls into three classes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : metrop_t269_inf_down_n_30_vs_t ] ) . for small clusters ( @xmath193 )",
    ", @xmath194 monotonically decreases to its equilibrium value .",
    "this behavior occurs because the initial random configuration has an abundance of small clusters so that lowering the temperature causes the small clusters to merge to form bigger ones . for intermediate size clusters ( @xmath195 ) , @xmath194 first increases and then decreases to its equilibrium value .",
    "the initial growth is due to the rapid coalescence of smaller clusters to form intermediate ones .",
    "after there are enough intermediate clusters , they slowly coalesce to form bigger clusters , which causes the decrease . for clusters with @xmath196 ,",
    "@xmath194 slowly increases to its equilibrium value .",
    "the range of sizes for these different classes of behavior depends on the system size . in all three cases @xmath180 can be fitted to the sum of two exponentials .",
    "one of the two coefficients is negative for @xmath195 for which @xmath180 overshoots its equilibrium value . the relaxation time @xmath188 is plotted in fig .",
