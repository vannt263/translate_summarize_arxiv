    "string theory is a competitive candidate for the quantum theory of gravity and the unification of all interactions in nature . because string theory requires extra dimensions to keep its consistency , it gives us a strong motivation to study the higher dimensional black hole when we consider gravity in string theory .",
    "recently , an exact solution for a black string flow was given in @xcite .",
    "in such a configuration , we do not need a negative cosmological constant to assure the existence of the black string which is necessary for the black string motivated by ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in this construction",
    "the horizon of this black string flow is closely similar to black funnels in @xcite .",
    "the construction of the black string flow is as flows .",
    "a thin black string falls freely into a very large black hole .",
    "the size of the black string @xmath0 and black hole @xmath1 have such a relation @xmath2 .",
    "since the black string is free - falling , one can expect that the two horizons merge into each other smoothly . in this picture , because the black string is falling , the thin black string will pour mass ( and charge ) to the large black hole . as a consequence , the black hole and black string can be regarded as a non - equilibrium system . since we have the @xmath2 , it is reasonable to say that the current of the flow is relatively small .",
    "if we study this phenomenon in a small time interval , which means that the time scale of any measurement we do here is much shorter than the time scale of the process itself , we can study the non - equilibrium thermodynamic fluctuations of the growing black hole that forms on the infinitely large black hole ` background ' i.e. the contact part .",
    "the method we used here is the laudau - lifshitz theory @xcite which has been successfully used to study the evaporation of different kinds of black holes@xcite . by this theory",
    ", we found the second moment of fluctuation of different black string flow and what kind of parameters can affect the fluctuation .",
    "this article is organised as : in section 2 , we study the evolution of horizon flow . in section 3 ,",
    "we use the laudau - lifshitz theory to analyse the fluctuation of the flow . in section 4 , we introduce charges into the system to see how these will affect the fluctuation .",
    "section 5 is the conclusion and outlook .",
    "suppose that we have a thin black string whose radium is @xmath3 , and freely falls into a infinitely large black hole . to illustrate the whole process , we plot a general graph . in fig.1 ,",
    "the black line denotes the black string , the gray part denotes the infinitely large black hole , the dashed line is the place where the black string and black hole meet and the arrows point the direction of the black string flow .",

    "when @xmath8 is schwarzschild , the resulting metric is @xmath9 when the black string is free falling , based on @xcite , we get @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the horizon of the black string flow . in fig.2",

    "when the radius is large enough the variation of @xmath14 is relatively small comparing to the size of the flowing system . in eq . , the derivative of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath15 is the speed of the falling black string .",

    "the segment can be regarded as a black hole .",
    "recalling that the n - dimensional volume of a euclidean ball of radius r in n - dimensional euclidean space is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is gamma function .",
    "the surface area of n - sphere of radius r is the boundary of the n+1-ball of radius r. the we have the following relation @xmath25 then the surface area of the black hole formed on the segment is @xmath26 in eq .",
    "we subtract the @xmath27 term , because it is the surface area of the black string .",
    "then the entropy of the black hole in @xmath28 spacetime dimension is @xmath29 the @xmath30 in eqs . and is the horizon of the black hole which is formed by the black string flow .",
    "then we have @xmath31 this is the evolution of the entropy with respect to time .",
    "when the size of the black string @xmath32 is much smaller than the size of the black hole at the point of their contact , we may approximate the process to a non - equilibrium steady state process .",
    "we can use landau - lifshitz theory to study the non - equilibrium thermodynamic fluctuations of the black string flow .",
    "such a theory has been applied well in the black hole system@xcite .    according to the landau - lifshitz theory , in a fluctuation - dissipative process the flux @xmath33 for a given thermodynamic quantity @xmath34 is @xmath35 and the rate of entropy production is @xmath36 here the positive sign represents the contribution to the entropy rate from the non - concave parts in the entropy and the minus sign is for other conditions .",
    "then the second moments in the fluctuation of the fluxes is@xcite @xmath37 from to , the quantities @xmath38 are the phenomenological transport coefficients ( or onsager phenomenological transport coefficients ) and @xmath39 is the thermodynamic force that is conjugate to the flux @xmath40 .",
    "the dot represents their derivative with respect to time t.    for a given length in @xmath16 direction , @xmath41 , the total mass of the black string is @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",

    "the thermodynamic force conjugate to @xmath46 is @xmath47 what we have calculated above is not the non - concave part of the entropy . according to eq .",
    ", the transport coefficient with respect to this is @xmath48 then by eq .",
    ", we have the second moments in the fluctuation of the mass flux @xmath49 in eqs.- , @xmath50 denotes the mass which has already flowed on the black hole from the black string .",
    "then based on eqs . and",
    "the second moment in the fluctuation of entropy is    @xmath51    the second moment in the fluctuation of entropy shows that it is driven by two kinds of parameters : the first one is the parameter related with the black hole that is @xmath50 ; the second one is the parameter related with the string flow that is @xmath14 . in eq .",
    ", the fluctuation of entropy can not diverge .",
    "for a more general black string metric we can introduce the electric charges .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the mass and charge of the black string and let @xmath50 and @xmath54 denote the mass and charge already on the black hole . for simplicity we just consider the condition that the dimension is d=5 @xmath55 with @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a metric function which should be positive outside the black sting horizon and should tend to 1 at @xmath58 . comparing with the previous analysis @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath59 under the d=5 condition , the entropy of the charged black hole formed by the flowing charged black string is @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the outer horizon of the black string and the @xmath62 is the outer horizon of black hole . according to eq . , the derivative of the entropy with respect to time is @xmath63 based on eq . , the mass flux is @xmath64 and the charge flux is @xmath65 in eq . , the second term accounts for the coupling between the gain rates of the mass and electric charge@xcite .",
    "these give us the second moments in the fluctuation of the flux(for details , see appendix a ) @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 the second moments in the entropy can be calculated from eq .",
    ", we can get    @xmath69    according to statistical mechanics , the phase transitions are usually related to the divergence of the relevant second moments@xcite . obviously , when @xmath70 the eq",
    ". diverges .",
    "this indicates that a critical phenomenon takes place .",
    "this phenomenon is only controlled by the variable of the black hole formed by the black string flow . however",
    ", when @xmath71 eqs.- show that the second moments in the fluctuation of the fluxes are independent of the metric of the black string flow . in ref.@xcite , this indicates that the system reaches a thermal equilibrium state . in this state ,",
    "@xmath71 , there is no flow actually . eqs . -",
    "then just show fluctuations around the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "in addition , we can define such a parameter @xmath72 . then the second moments eq .",
    "diverge when @xmath73 .",
    "basing on the arguments in @xcite , @xmath74 can be regarded as an order parameter in the landau order - disorder phase transition .",
    "the @xmath75 case represents the symmetric phase , in which the whole system is under the extremal condition .",
    "the @xmath76 represents the symmetry broken phase , in which the whole system is under non - extremal condition .",
    "the black string flow we analyse here is an approximate system that a black string smoothly merges into a black hole . in this paper",
    ", we investigated the non - equilibrium thermodynamic fluctuations of the black string flow and charged black string flow .",
    "we have considered black hole growing as a non - equilibrium thermodynamic process because the black string pours mass ( and charge ) into the black hole . according to landau - lifshitz theory ,",
    "the divergence of second order momentum of thermodynamic fluctuation is the signature of phase transitions , we find that in black string flow the second momentum of the flux does not diverge .",
    "however , in charged black string flow condition , the second momentum of the flux is divergent at @xmath70 , i.e. at the extremal conditions . even though the phase transition does not depend on the property of the black string , the parameters such as @xmath77 and @xmath57 of the black string",
    "can affect the fluctuation of the black hole .",
    "when the system reaches thermodynamic equilibrium state at @xmath71 , the fluctuation is free from the black string , the phase transition only depends on the parameter of the black hole . such a fluctuation may affect some observations at astrophysical scale , for example , through the gravitational lensing@xcite and the motion of test particles@xcite@xcite .    a similar configuration , the black string with rotation ( and charged)@xcite , can be used to study the fluctuation in that system . in section 4 , we just considered the charged string that is the black string with electric charges . for",
    "the string - charged , i.e. , the strings are electric sources of a 2-form potential @xmath78 , or 0-brane charge that sources a maxwell potential @xmath79 .",
    "since the black string flow solution with charge and rotation can reach a thermodynamic equilibrium at the extreme limit , we may study the thermodynamic equilibrium fluctuation of the black string flow by using the thermodynamic curvature that has been applied well in this field@xcite .",

    "and , we have @xmath80 in eq .",
    ", the first term relates to the mass flow directly , the second term is the coupling between the gain rates of the mass and the electric charge .",
    "this is due to a fact that the potential energy of black string flow will increase when this flow pours down to the black hole",
