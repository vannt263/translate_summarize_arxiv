    "the interaction of a neutral atom with a material surface is a problem profusely addressed in the literature @xcite . in most of the approaches",
    "the atom is taken in a stationary state with respect to ( w.r.t ) the time of observation . for distances greater than the relevant atomic transition wavelengths",
    "this interaction is referred to as _ retarded casimir - polder ( cp ) interaction _ , while for distances much shorter than those wavelengths it is referred to as _ van der waals _ or _ non - retarded cp interaction_.    it is well known in cavity - qed that vacuum rabi oscillations are generated between two non - degenerate atomic states as a result of the strong coupling of the atom to a single resonant cavity mode @xcite . in this letter",
    "we show that rabi oscillations between two degenarate atomic states can also be induced by the cp interaction of the atom with a reflecting surface .",
    "in contrast to the cavity - qed vacuum rabi oscillations , all the vacuum modes participate on the resultant _ cp induced rabi oscillations_.    the net effect of the cp interaction on non - degenerate atomic states is an additive level shift @xcite . in particular , the resonant component of the cp interaction gives rise to an effective renormalization of the transition frequencies @xcite . on the contrary , on ( quasi)degenerate atomic states",
    "the cp interaction may cause the admixture of neighboring states ( eg .",
    "it is in this case that , under the conditions investigated in this letter , the atom oscillates coherently between the two ( quasi)degenerate states with a well defined rabi frequency proportional to the strength of the cp interaction . in order to prove this we study the time - evolution of the wave function of an atom initially prepared in a coherent superposition of ( quasi)degenerate states .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon with the computation of the cp induced rabi frequency on a @xmath0rb atom as it interacts with a reflecting surface and oscillates between two zeeman sublevels of its ground state .",
    "the resultant variation of atomic angular momentum is provided by the vacuum photons which mediate the interaction with the surface .",
    "in order to show the rabi oscillations induced by the cp interaction of a reflecting surface on an atom , we compute the time evolution operator , @xmath1 , restricted to the two atomic states of our interest , @xmath2 .",

    "we adopt an approach based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) according to which the atom is treated as a quantum system while the conducting surface is regarded as a classical object concerning its interaction with the em field , and we restrict ourselves to zero temperature .",

    "fig.[fig5 ] contains the plot of @xmath155 as a function of the distance to the surface .",
    "in particular , for @xmath51 and @xmath52 in @xmath153 , the cp induced rabi frequency is @xmath156hz at 40 nm and @xmath156mhz at 270 nm approximately .",
    "it is worth stressing that the symmetry of the setup yields the same additive shifts for the states @xmath51 and @xmath52 , keeping this way their degeneracy .",
    "in particular , the electric cp interaction provides a level shift between 0.2mhz and 70 mhz within the interval 40nm@xmath157 nm , which guarantees the perturbative nature of the calculation ; and the magnetic interaction of the net magnetic moments of the states @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath158 respectively , provides them with a common shift in the range 0.01hz-4.3hz which raises them over the state @xmath159 .",
    "this might be a potential problem for the observation of rabi oscillations since both @xmath51 and @xmath52 can decay into the state @xmath159 through an m1 transition with the same rate , @xmath160 .",
    "this rate depends on the actual conductivity of the reflecting surface through its skin depth , @xmath161 . for the reasonable assumption that @xmath162 nm we find @xcite , @xmath163hz(40nm@xmath164 at @xmath165 nm and @xmath166mhz(270nm@xmath164 at @xmath167 nm . in order to complete a rabi cycle , @xmath168 is necessary , which is guaranteed by the initial assumption @xmath162 nm within the interval 40nm@xmath157 nm .",
    "in addition , we note that similar values are obtained for the non - additive dissipative terms , @xmath169 , which means that their contribution to @xmath170 can be discarded in good approximation .",
    "finally , we observe that through a rabi semi - cycle , @xmath171 , the total angular momentum of the atom , @xmath172 , varies an amount @xmath132 along the quantization axis @xmath104 . for an atom in the state @xmath51 at @xmath56 , it holds @xmath173 .",
    "more specifically , during a rabi semi - cycle the nuclear spin varies from @xmath174 to @xmath175 while the electronic spin varies in the oppossite sense , from @xmath176 to @xmath177 along @xmath104 , such that @xmath178 .",
    "this variation of angular momentum is provided by the vacuum photons which mediate the interaction with the reflecting surface as explained in fig.[fig4](@xmath39 ) . at a theoretical level ,",
    "conservation of total angular momentum implies that , in order to compensate for this variation , the angular momentum of the reflecting surface must vary an equal amount in opposite sense .",
    "it explains why the axis of quantization must be taken parallel to the surface as the surface is seen as an infinite plane from the atom .",
    "the rotational invariance of an infinite plane around its perpendicular axis  the @xmath40 axis in our case  would prevent otherwise the exchange of angular momentum between the surface and the atom in this direction .",
    "an explicit calculation of the angular momentum of the surface would require a microscopical model for the interaction between the surface and the em field .",
    "we finish this section with a remark on rydberg states . at first glance",
    "it could be thought that greater values of @xmath170 would be obtained in the oscillation between zeeman sublevels of rydberg states with large principal number @xmath179 .",
    "a study of the scaling behaviour as a function of @xmath179 of the dipole moment matrix elements and resonant frequencies which enter the expression of @xmath180 @xcite reveals that much greater values of @xmath170 can only be obtained at distances for which the cp interaction enters the retarded regime w.r.t .",
    "the d@xmath145 and d@xmath146 transtions of the ground state , while it remains in the non - retarded regime w.r.t .",
    "the transition between neighboring rydberg states .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig5 ] , where the rydberg state is chosen to be @xmath154 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath170 is analogous to the one presented above for the zeeman sublevels of the ground state @xcite . at distances greater than @xmath181 nm , the values of @xmath170 are much larger for oscillations between zeeman sublevels of the rydberg state .",
    "however , those values are still too small to be observed due to the short lifetimes of the excited states @xcite .",
