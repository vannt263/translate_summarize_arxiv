    "based on the @xmath1 two - color selection criterion meant to identify @xmath2 passively evolving galaxies , a sample of seven objects has been identified in the udf for which acs grism spectra confirm both the high redshift ( @xmath297 ) and the current absence ( or very low ) ongoing star formation . the analysis conducted over the _ ultradeep _ acs imaging further shows that the objects are morphologically early - type galaxies .",
    "the redshifts are derived from the identification of the spectral feature at the rest - frame @xmath298   due mainly to mgi and mgii absorptions in late a- and f - type stars , and which shows up prominently only in synthetic stellar populations with no ( or very low ) star formation in the last @xmath4 gyr .",
    "the seds and acs grism spectra of 5 of the objects are best reproduced by a star formation history initiated @xmath299 gyr before , and completely discontinued over the last @xmath300 gyr , implying that the passive evolution started at @xmath301 . in the other cases a similar age constraint",
    "is inferred , but the spectra are best reproduced by an exponentially declining sfr , with @xmath302 gyr .",
    "the overall spectral energy distributions of the objects indicate stellar masses in excess of @xmath303 and we infer that the comoving volume density of such massive , early - type galaxies at @xmath304 is about @xmath305 of the local value .",
    "the uncertainty in the derived fraction is dominated by cosmic variance , given the small field covered by the udf .",
    "allowing for the expected clustering of these galaxies we infer that at the @xmath229 level such fraction could be as low as @xmath306 or as high as @xmath307 .",
    "clearly , the exploration of wider fields is necessary to accurately pinpoint the actual decrease with redshifts of the number density of massive galaxies which are passively evolving .",
    "however , a @xmath232 test indicates that beyond @xmath220 this number density is likely to drop very rapidly .",
    "one intriguing aspect of the present findings is the quite small effective radii derived from the acs @xmath16-band images , which in 4 out of 7 cases are less than 1 kpc .",
    "given their high mass , the passive evolution of such very compact objects will bring them in a region of the kormendy relation ( or , equivalently , of the fundamental plane ) which is depopulated at @xmath194 .",
    "we discuss various possibilities to explain this apparent paradox , including a morphological k - correction ( e.g. , due to the possible presence of blue cores in these galaxies ) , or of an agn point - like source biasing the @xmath170 measurements , or eventually some evolutionary effects such as if the observed galaxies were still subject to further growth at lower redshifts . while we mention hints favoring one or another option , the existing data do not allow to reach any firm conclusion on this specific issue .",
    "finally , we point out that while in the local universe most of the most massive galaxies are passively evolving giant ellipticals , the present data  combined with previous evidence in a partly overlapping field ( daddi et al .",
    "2004a;b )  indicates that by @xmath220 passively - evolving and seemingly vigorous starbursts galaxies occur in comparable numbers among most massive galaxies .",
    "this remains a major challenge for the current theoretical simulations of galaxy formation to reproduce .",
