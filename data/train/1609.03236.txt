    "a wide variety of physical and mathematical phenomena may be modelled as a system of interacting identical particles .",
    "one of the simplest examples of such an application is a collection of electrostatically  charged classical particles , but other examples include atoms in a fluid @xcite , dislocations in a crystalline solid @xcite , ginzburg ",
    "landau vortices in a superconductor @xcite , spin states in an atomic lattice @xcite , eigenvalues of random matrices @xcite , or simply a collection of hard spheres @xcite .",
    "a core challenge in studying such particle systems is to identify the features of the thermodynamic equilibrium in a system where the number of particles is very large . at low temperatures ,",
    "this is closely related to finding the configurations with the lowest total potential energy , i.e.  the _ mechanical equilibria_.    typically , low potential energy configurations in large particle systems exhibit _ crystallisation _ phenomena , i.e.  particles arrange themselves into a regular structure with a slowly  varying density .",
    "however , it is often difficult to determine a similarly detailed description of the particle behaviour in regions where the density varies rapidly , for example at a free surface , or close to a rigid confining structure .",
    "such boundary properties and other effects of finite system size are a significant theme in current scientific research @xcite since it is through boundary interactions that a large number of physical processes take place , some important examples being contact @xcite , catalysis @xcite and crystal growth @xcite .",
    "this work contributes to this body of research by studying a simple model for a system of particles confined to a finite interval , and obtains concrete mathematical results concerning the boundary behaviour at mechanical equilibrium , advancing some of the mathematical techniques currently available to study such boundary effects in the process . in the model considered ,",
    "particles are assumed to interact via a repulsive pair potential that decays as the distance between particles increases . for a sufficiently rapid decay of the repulsive interactions , we obtain an asymptotic description of the boundary behaviour by developing a matched asymptotic expansion for the particle positions at equilibrium , and an asymptotic representation of the minimal energy via the technique of @xmath0convergence .",
    "a particular challenge for this task is that we do not rely on a finite interaction range , and instead include general long - range interactions between particles .",
    "our study takes place in the context of a variety of recent mathematical results aiming to better understand surface effects in similar particle systems , notably @xcite in the setting of dislocation pile - ups . while @xcite focuses on the case in which the interaction potential is homogeneous , and @xcite studies boundary layers in a continuum model for the particle density , our contribution is the derivation of a _ discrete _ description of the boundary layer for a general class of interaction potentials .",
    "two particular examples that we have in mind are pile - ups of dislocation walls @xcite and pile - ups of dislocation dipoles @xcite .      we suppose that @xmath1 identical particles are confined to lie in the interval @xmath2 $ ] , and all pairs of particles mutually interact via a potential @xmath3 $ ] , which is a function of the inter - particle distance .",
