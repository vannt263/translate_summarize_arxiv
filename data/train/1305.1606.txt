    "have to be used .",
    "in particular , taking the loop scalar or electron mass to be either zero or large generally leads to simplifications .",
    "this is particularly so for the latter case since , at large mass , the effective action can be reduced to its heat kernel expansion , which is simple in structure and for whose computation powerful methods exist @xcite .",
    "however , it is fair to say that , even at the numerical level , presently there is still no method available that would allow one to obtain reliable results for the effective action for arbitrary masses and in a generic background ( the `` worldline monte carlo '' approach @xcite may ultimately provide such a formalism , although it seems too early to tell ) . for radially separable backgrounds , on the other hand , during the last few years the so - called `` partial - wave - cutoff method '' @xcite has been developed , which seems to have all the properties one might request of such a numerical method .",
    "this class of backgrounds , although still far from generic , includes , e.g. , instantons , monopoles and vortices .",
    "the method , originally invented for the case of the quark determinant in an instanton background , is based on a decomposition of the relevant one - loop operator into partial waves of definite angular momentum , and a separation into low and high angular momentum contributions , where the former are computed using the gelfand - yaglom method , and the latter in a wkb expansion .",
    "it principally applies to the scalar loop , but can be extended to the spinor loop case for certain backgrounds .",
    "an example of this is the instanton where , by self - duality , the spinor effective action can be reduced to the scalar one @xcite .    in @xcite g.v .",
    "dunne et al . initiated the application of this method to the important class of @xmath0 symmetric fields , first introduced by s.l .",
    "adler in @xcite and studied later by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "these backgrounds can be defined ( in euclidean metric ) as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a t hooft symbol @xcite , and @xmath4 a radial profile function .",
    "such backgrounds provide a good testing ground since , on one hand , they still permit a reduction from the spinor to the scalar loop case , while on the other hand , the profile function @xmath4 is , to a good extent , arbitrary , thus leading to a large class of models . in @xcite ,",
    "the `` partial - wave - cutoff method '' was applied to various profile functions , in the full mass range , and the results compared to the large mass expansion , as well as to the derivative expansion . in all cases ,",
    "the method was found to be in good agreement with the large mass approximation , and in some cases , also the derivative expansion could be used to check agreement in the small mass regime . in the present paper , we continue the investigation started in @xcite in two directions .    first , in @xcite",
    ", the renormalization of the effective action had been done using an unphysical renormalization condition , designed to yield a finite zero - mass limit .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for large mass then is dominated by an unphysical logarithm that made it difficult to numerically test this behavior beyond that logarithmic term . here",
    ", we instead consider the physically renormalized effective action , which has a logarithmic divergence at small , but not at large mass .",
    "this enables us to probe the large mass behavior in deeper detail than was achieved in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we are able to numerically verify the two leading mass levels in the large mass expansion of the physical effective action . since not all of the relevant terms in this expansion seem to be available in the literature , and moreover the coefficients depend on the chosen operator basis , we also present here their calculation from scratch , using the worldline path integral formalism along the lines of @xcite .",
    "second , this class of @xmath0 symmetric backgrounds has been extensively studied by m. fry @xcite in a long - term effort to demonstrate that , as in the case of 1 + 1 dimensional qed @xcite , also in the four - dimensional case the small @xmath5 behavior of the effective action is , after subtraction of the two- and four - point contributions , dominated by a @xmath6 coming from the chiral anomaly term @xmath7 , whenever such a term is present . a simple test case for this conjecture in the class of backgrounds defined by ( [ deffield ] )",
    "would be the profile function    g(r ) = [ gstandard ] where @xmath8 are positive constants .",
    "the background ( [ deffield ] ) with this profile function will be called the `` standard @xmath0 symmetric background '' in the following .",
    "our numerical method does not really allow us to treat this case as it stands , since it has insufficient radial fall - off .",
    "even though , we will provide strong support for this hypothesis by supplying the profile function ( [ gstandard ] ) with a radial suppression factor @xmath9 , and studying the double limit of small @xmath5 and small @xmath10 . combining a perturbative and nonperturbative approach",
    ", we will show that the appropriately renormalized effective action remains finite in the small @xmath5 limit for any positive value of @xmath10 , and that the only obstacle preventing one to take the double limit @xmath11 resides in the perturbative two - point contribution to the effective action .",

    "let us start with some general facts on the effective action in four - dimensional spinor qed ( we work in the euclidean space throughout ) .",

    "we consider a field of the form ( [ deffield ] ) , where @xmath4 is a radial profile function .",
    "for this background , the negative chirality part of the dirac operator takes a simple form , @xmath20 hence , we use ( [ choice ] ) in the form    @xmath21 & = & 2\\gamma^{(-)}_{\\rm ren}[a ] + \\delta\\gamma_{\\rm ren}[a]\\;. \\label{choose}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the field strength tensor for the background ( [ deffield ] ) is    @xmath22    from ( [ difference ] ) , we see how the choice of @xmath4 determines the presence or absence of zero - modes . to be specific , the number of zero - modes is counted by    @xmath23    therefore , as long as @xmath4 falls faster than @xmath24 , there are no zero - modes . as was already mentioned in the introduction , the partial - wave - cutoff method which we wish to use is not guaranteed to work well in the standard case @xmath25 due to insufficient radial fall - off .",
    "this suggests to study the following more general family of profile functions  @xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath10 are parameters that control the amplitude , steepness , and range of the potential . for this profile function ,",
    "the choice of @xmath10 produces one of the following cases :    @xmath29    thus , we have zero modes only for @xmath30 , corresponding to the standard case",

    "let @xmath34 denote the ( scheme independent ) effective action obtained after subtraction of the two - point contribution .",

    "further , an important application of ( [ limfry ] ) is the search for a nontrivial zero of the determinant    _ 5 : = r - _ 4 , [ defdet5 ] where @xmath35 is the four - point contribution to @xmath34 @xcite . in this connection",
