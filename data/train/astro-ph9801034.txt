    "binary systems constitute at least half stellar galactic population ( @xmath3 stars ) and are reliable sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) . for a binary system consisting of two solar - mass stars ,",
    "the characteristic time of orbital decay due to angular momentum removal by gw becomes shorther than the hubble time ( @xmath4 years ) if its orbital period is less than about 14 hours .",
    "observations of binary pulsars with a neutron star ( ns ) as secondary component ( taylor 1992 ) provides us with the strongest observational evidence for this fundamental process , and the most compact ns or black holes ( bh ) binaries merging due to gw emission are considered as primary real targets for the initial gw iterferometric ligo - type detectors ( abramovici et al .",
    "an enormous energy is released during the coalescence of a compact ns+ns binary ( typically , of the order of @xmath5 ergs ) , but the galactic merging rate of ns+ns binaries is fairly small , @xmath6  a few @xmath7 per year ( see lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 1997 for more detail ) , and to detect an acceptable number of such mergers per year ( the experimentalists usually quote the number of 3 events per year with the signal - to - noise ratio 3 - 5 ) , they are planned to be studied from distances up to 200 mpc ( e.g. , thorne 1987 ) .",
    "typical frequencies of gw emitted during compact binary ns coalescence are about 100 - 1000 hz , depending on the mass of the stars involved .",
    "orbital frequencies at which a binary system may be observable are limited by the size of the components ; the evolution of the orbital separation strongly changes when one of the stars fills its critical roche lobe .",
    "typically , mass exchange between the components has much larger effect on the binary separation than the orbital angular momentum removal due to gw , so the orbital frequency of a given binary system may fall within a wide range from a fraction of hour to several years , depending on the initial parameters and details of evolution .",
    "the evolution of any star , however , ends up with the formation of a compact remnant ( bh , nh or white dwarf ( wd ) ) , so when two such compact stars remains in a binary , its orbital evolution is totally controlled by the removal of orbital angular momentum by gw ( the possible rare exceptions are very hot young wd with a strong stellar wind or the cases where a low - mass wd companion is evaporated by a strong pulsar emission ; we will not consider them here ) . when only gw emission drives the orbital evolution , a simple analytical treatment is in order .    as the number of binary stars in the galaxy is very large , the gw emitted by them ( at strictly twice the orbital frequency if the orbit eccentricity is zero ) form a stochastic background in the frequency range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 hz ( mironovskij , 1965 ; rosi and zimmerman 1976 ; lipunov and postnov 1987 ; lipunov et al .",
    "1987 ; hills et al .",
    "1990 ; lipunov et al .",
    "being interesting by itself , this background , however , is viewed as a noise burying a possible cosmological gravitational wave background ( cgwb ) , which bears the unique imprint of physical processes occurring at the very early ( near - plankian ) age of the universe ( see e.g. grishchuk 1988 for a review ) .",
    "a stochastic gw background is commonly measured in terms of the energy density per logarithmic frequency interval related to the critical energy density to close the universe , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 g @xmath12 where @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 is the present value of the hubble constant , @xmath15 is the speed of light ) .",
    "cosmic microwave background fluctuations experimentally detected in the last years ( smoot 1992 ; strukov et al .",
    "1993 ) put upper bounds on cgwb of order @xmath16 at both lisa and ligo frequencies assuming equation of state @xmath17 at the inflationary stage of the universe . in this model",
    ", cgwb spectrum is inversely proportional to the frequency keeping @xmath18 at @xmath19 hz ( rubakov et al .",
    "if real , this cgwb has no chance to be detected with ongoing gw detectors ( see schutz 1995 , 1996 ; allen 1996 ) .",
    "we should note , however , that the measurements of cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations put constraints on the cgwb only at very low frequencies @xmath20 hz , so the dependence of cgwb energy density upon frequency is very crucial .",
    "the situation , however , starts to change after a recent processing of the cobe data has provided us with some fresh information about the power - law spectral index of primordial perturbations ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ; brukhanov et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the point is that the spectrum of the primordial perturbations may be directly recalculated into the spectrum of relic gw background ( see grishchuk 1996 and references therein ) . according to grishchuk ( 1996 ) , the fact that the cobe data point to some deviations from harrison - zeldovich spectrum of the initial perturbations translates into the deviations from @xmath17 equation of state at the epoch of inflation which would lead to serious changes in the cgwb as a whole .",
    "now its energy density may increase with frequency reaching @xmath21 at @xmath22 hz .",
    "this conclusion holds regardless of the real cause of the observed cmb temperatrure fluctuations ( either they are due to density fluctuations or relic gravitational waves ) .",
    "if grishchuk s calculations are correct , this opens a novel possibility of detecting cgwb with the proposed lisa space interferometer ( schutz 1996 ) .",
    "the conventional technique for detection of the stochastic gw backgrounds assumes the cross - corelation of outputs of at least two independent interferometers ( grishchuk 1976 ; compton & schutz 1996 and reference therein ) .",
    "the lisa project does not plan to have two independent interferometers , however the strength of the signal ( @xmath21 ) is predicted so high that probably the signal could be directly detected .",
    "this important finding raises the question : at which frequency gw confusion limit from binary systems becomes lower than the detectability threshold dictated by the signal to noise ratio equal one ?",
    "in other terms , beginning at what frequency can we be sure that no known noise sources of astrophysical origin exist and therefore if detected , only cosmological background can contribute at these frequencies ?",
    "the aim of the present paper is to answer this question using new calculations of binary stellar evolution ( see lipunov et al .",
    "1995 , 1996b , 1997 for more detail and full references ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the upper limit on the binary stochastic background in our galaxy at frequencies 1 mhz - 0.1 hz ( lisa diapason ) . at these frequencies ,",
    "the background is mostly due to binary wd mergers .",
    "we use the sn ia statistics to constrain galactic binary wd merging rate @xmath23 yr@xmath14",
    ". the upper limit on the background at these frequencies is @xmath24 for the inverse - average distance to typical binary wd 10 kpc . in section 3 ,",
    "we calculate the binary galactic background using monte - carlo modeling of binary star evolution in the galaxy .",
    "the comparison of the calculated backgrounds with the proposed lisa sensitivity is given in section 4 .",
    "in appendix a we give an alternative derivation of equation ( [ h_c ] ) for the part of the background formed by coalescing binary stars only . in appendix",
    "b we briefly discuss cosmological effects .",
    "it is widely recognized that merging compact binary stars ( wd+wd , ns+ns ... ) determine the high - frequency part of binary stochastic background ( e.g. , lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 1987 ; hils , bender & webbink 1990 ) . in this section",
    "we wish to show that this portion is mostly significant in the lisa frequency band and provides an upper limit on this background in general .",
    "consider a model galaxy consisting entirely of binary systems .",
    "let us assume a stationary star formation rate ( which describes well the situation in our galaxy )",
    ". we will be interested in only lisa frequency range , @xmath25 hz , inside which only coalescing binary white dwarfs and binary neutron stars contribute . even if binary neutron stars coalesce at a rate of 1/10000 yr in the galaxy ( lipunov et al .",
    "1987 ; 1995 ; tutukov and yungelson 1993 ) , their number still should be much smaller than the white dwarf binaries , and in this section we restrict ourselves to considering only binary wd .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the stochastic gwb may be fully characterized by the energy emitted per logarithmic frequency interval . in the case of a binary system",
    "this energy is exactly equal to the change in the orbital energy of two stars during the time period needed for the gw frequency ( which is twice the orbital frequency for circular orbits ) to pass the frequency interval @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , in the stationary situation the net energy emitted in gw will be determined by the rate @xmath27 at which the systems enter the specific frequency interval and the rate of their orbital frequency change @xmath28 . clearly , if the binary orbit evolves only due to gw emission , the result will depend on the rate @xmath27 only .",
    "indeed , the stationarity implies that the number of binary wd per unit logarithmic frequency interval may be determined from the continuity equation @xmath29 the total energy emitted per second per unit logarithmic frequency interval at @xmath30 by all such binaries in the galaxy is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the characterictic gw luminosity at frequency @xmath30 which is dependent on the so - called `` chirp mass '' @xmath33 of the binary system : @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the total and @xmath36 reduced masses ) .",
    "we use @xmath37 for some average mass of the typical binary ( see discussion followed eq . [ [ omega ] ] below ) . for the orbital frequency change due to gw",
    "we find @xmath38 ( we have used the fact that @xmath39 and the third kepler s law for binary semimajor axis @xmath40 ) , so if @xmath41 we arrive at @xmath42    for an isotropic background we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the inverse - square average distance to the typical source .",
    "strictly speaking , this distance ( as well as the chirp mass ) may be a function of frequency since the binaries characterized by different chirp masses @xmath45 may be differently distributed in the galaxy .",
    "we are highly ignorant about the real distribution of binaries in the galaxy , but taking the mean photometric distance for a spheroidal distribution in the form @xmath46\\,\\exp[-(z / z_0)^2]\\ ] ] ( @xmath47 is the radial distance to the galactic center and @xmath48 the hight above the galactic plane ) with @xmath49 kpc and @xmath50 kpc with @xmath51 kpc is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "substituting @xmath52 into equation ( [ omega ] ) we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54  yr@xmath55 is the galactic rate of binary wd mergers .    in terms of the characteristic dimensionless amplitude of the noise background that determines the signal - to - noise ratio when cross - correlating outputs of two independent interferometers ( cf .",
    "thorne 1987 , eq . [ 65 ] ) we have @xmath56 irrespective of @xmath57 ( naturally ) .",
    "explicit derivation of equation ( [ h_c ] ) is given in the appendix a. equation ( [ h_c ] ) shows that at high frequencies of interest here the gw background is fully determined by the galactic rate of binary wd mergers and is independent of ( complicated ) details of binary evolution at lower frequencies ( the examples of calculated spectra at lower frequencies see in lipunov & postnov 1987 ; lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 1987 ; hils et al .",
    "1990 , and below ) .",
    "all above considerations are valid for frequencies at which more than one binary system fall within the logarithmic frequency interval @xmath58 .",
    "formally this limiting frequency is specified by the requirement @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 which is , however , already close to the limiting orbital frequency for a double wd binary .",
    "as the number of systems per logarithmic frequency interval rapidly decreases with frequency , @xmath61 , the stochastic background starts forming shortly below this limiting frequency .",
    "note that combining equations ( [ h_c ] ) and ( [ f_cr ] ) we can find the relationship @xmath62 above which binary - merger - formed gw background appears ; this limit depends on the mean galactic distance @xmath47 , which is known much more reliably than binary wd merger rate @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    ", however , this boundary lies below the rms lisa sensitivity at all frequencies .",
    "the derivation of the binary background given above ( see also appendix a ) becomes more accurate for extragalactic binaries .",
    "the contribution from extragalactic binaries may be shown to be smaller than from galactic ones at all frequencies ( see , e.g. hils et al .",
    "1990 , lipunov et al .",
    "1995 ) , but for completeness we give here the final result in terms of @xmath65 which bears a clear physical meaning .    at the detector s",
    "frequency @xmath66 , galaxies lying inside the proper volume @xmath67 at redshift @xmath48 contribute @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the gw luminosity at the source frequency @xmath30 within each galaxy , @xmath70 is the luminosity distance , @xmath71 is the present density of galaxies and @xmath72 is the density of galaxies at the redshift @xmath48 without evolutionary effects . in the universe with zero curvature @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the proper motion distance . taking into account that the present density of galaxies can be rewritten through the fraction of luminous matter baryons ,    @xmath75    equation ( [ do ] ) can be recasted in the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the baryon mass of a typical galaxy per which the merging rate @xmath63 is calculated .    for flat ( @xmath78 )",
    "standard cosmological model without @xmath79-term @xmath80 .",
    "noticing that @xmath81 scales as @xmath82 ( eq . [ [ eorb_a ] ] from appendix a ) , we may integrate equation ( [ do(z ) ] ) up to @xmath83  the redshift at which first wd mergers had started  to obtain @xmath84 this expression bears very clear physical meaning simply as the fraction of energy emitted in gw over the hubble time ( @xmath85 ) by wd mergers with respect to the rest - mass energy of baryons in stars in the universe .",
    "the ratio between the cosmological and galactic backgrounds is @xmath86 regardless of the poorly known merger rates , which shows that cosmological binary background is generally a few times smaller than the galactic one .",
    "strong source evolution with redshift would increase this ratio , but at present we can not calculate reliably these effects .",
    "the galactic merger rate of close binary wd is unknown .",
    "one possible way to recover it is searching for close white dwarf binaries . a recent study ( marsh et al .",
    "1995 ) , revealed a larger fraction of such systems than had previously been thought .",
    "still , the statistics of such binaries in the galaxy remains very poor .",
    "if coalescing binary wd are associated with sn ia explosions , as proposed by iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) and further investigated by many authors ( for a recent review of sn ia progenitors see branch et al .",
    "1995 ) , their coalescence rate can be constrained using much more representative sn ia statistics .",
    "branch et al .",
    "( 1995 ) concluded that coalescing co - co binary wd remain the most plausible candidates mostly contributing to the sn ia explosions .",
    "the galactic rate of sn ia is estimated @xmath87 per year ( tamman et al .",
    "1994 ; van den bergh and mcclure 1994 ) , which is close to the calculated rate of co - co coalescences ( @xmath88 ) . the coalescence rate for he - co wd and he - he wd ( other possible progenitors of sn ia ) falls ten times short of that for co - co wd ( branch et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we note further that binary wd mergers as main progenitors of the sn ia explosions start falling out of favour in the last years ( see especially critical studies by nomoto et al .",
    "evolutionary , double wd are formed through the common envelope stage ( iben and tutukov 1984 , webbink 1984 ) . in 1990s , with the calculation of new opacities , the possibility appeared for a wd , accreting even at a very high rate from the secondary companion in a binary system , to avoid the common envelope formation because of efficient stellar wind ( hachisu et al .",
    "this mechanism decreases the double wd formation rate and explains why the observed space density of binary degenerate dwarfs is smaller than derived from iben and tutukov s scenario .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the observed sn ia rate provides a secure _ upper limit _ to the double wd merger rate regardless of the evolutionary considerations .",
    "in this section we discuss the galactic gw background calculated with the scenario machine code for binary population synthesis in our galaxy ( see lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 1995 , 1996b for full description of the code ) .",
    "briefly , we use a model galaxy with the total stellar mass of @xmath89 m@xmath90 and half mass in binaries .",
    "we assume a constant star formation rate of 1 m@xmath90 per year which is a reasonable approximation for our galaxy . assuming the salpeter mass distribution function @xmath91",
    ", this star formation rate requires the minimal mass of the star to be @xmath92 m@xmath90 in order to produce the total stellar mass of the galaxy during the hubble time of 15 billion years .",
    "the initial mass ratios of the modelled binaries @xmath93 are assumed to be uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 ( see , however , discussion in lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 1996a ) .",
    "the important evolutionary parameter  the efficiency of the common envelope stage @xmath94  was fixed at 1 .",
    "another crucial evolutionary parameter , the distribution of the kick velocity imparted to a neutron star at birth , is not very important here as we are interested mostly in low - mass stars ( with initial masses",
    "@xmath95 m@xmath90 ) which evolve ultimately into wds .",
    "the position of the sun in the outskirts of the galaxy makes the binary stochastic background anisotropic ( see lipunov et al .",
    "the exact calculations of this background thus would require the knowledege of the spatial distribution of binary stars in the galaxy , which is uncertain , so we restrict ourselves to consider the average amplitude of the stochastic background using the mean photometric distance in the galaxy 7.9 kpc as explained in the previous section .",
    "the calculated background is shown in fig . 1 by the thick solid line .",
    "for comparison , we plotted bender et al s data ( filled quadrangles ) .",
    "the upper frequency at which the stochastic gw background formed by galactic merging binaries becomes smaller than the detector s noise limit @xmath96 may be derived from equation ( [ h_c ] ) : @xmath97    the upper limit ( [ h_c ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "1 for different rates of binary wd mergers @xmath98 assuming the chirp mass @xmath99 ( as for two co white dwarfs with equal masses @xmath100 ) .",
    "these lines intersect the proposed lisa rms sensitivity at    @xmath101    this means that at frequencies higher than @xmath102 hz no continuous gw backgrounds of galactic origin are presently known to contribute above the rms - level of lisa space laser interferometer .",
    "the contribution from extragalactic binaries is still lower regardless of the poorly known binary wd merging rate ( at least in the limit of no strong source evolution with @xmath48 )",
    ". other possible sources could be extragalactic massive bh binary systems ( e.g. hils and bender 1995 ) .",
    "their number in the universe can be fairly high ( e.g. rees 1997 ) , but no reliable estimates of their contribution are available at present",
    ". the lower limit ( [ lim ] ) is already close to the lisa sensitivity limit at 0.1 hz , but we stress that the assumptions used in its derivation are upper limits , so the actual frequency beyond which no binary stochastic backgrounds contribute may be three times lower .",
    "this precise limit depends on the details of binary wd formation and evolution which are still poorly known .",
    "1 demonstrates that the calculated gw background intersects lisa sensitivity curve at frequencies @xmath103 hz , and bender et al s curve at even lower frequencies @xmath104 hz .",
    "the latter is probably due to bender et al s curve being derived from observational estimate of double wd galactic density in the solar neighborhoods ; we stress once more that once formed , the binary wd will evolve until the less massive companion fills its roche lobe ; unless the mass ratio is sufficiently far from one ( cf .",
    "webbink 1984 ) , the merger should occur .",
    "therefore bender et al s curve provides a secure _ lower limit _ to the galactic binary stochastic gw background .",
    "we also note that if the coalescence of two wd with inequal masses is prevented by mass transfer process ( then the orbital period of the system begins increasing ) , some features on the shape of the background may emerge ( cf .",
    "discussion of the minimum orbital period for cataclysmic variables in lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 1987 ) .",
    "presently , we can not rule out the high galactic double wd merger rate ( 1/300 - 1/1000 yr@xmath14 ) , and therefore can consider @xmath105 to lie within the frequency range @xmath106 hz .",
    "we conclude that no gw background of galactic origin above this frequencies should contribute at the rms - noise level of lisa interferometer , and hence the detection of an isotropic stochastic signal at frequencies @xmath107 hz with an appreciable signal - to - noise level ( which possibly may be done using one interferometer ) would strongly indicate its cosmological origin . to be detectable by lisa , the power of relic gw background should be @xmath1 in this frequency range .",

    "equation ( [ h_c ] ) can be derived explicitly , without using the notion of @xmath65 ( instead , one can use @xmath108 to determine @xmath65 ; both means are , of course , fully equivalent ) .",
    "we reproduce here this equation keeping proportionalities @xmath109 we find it convenient to introduce new variables :      @xmath111 this units allows us to write all relevant quantities in a compact form with clear physical meaning keeping @xmath112 and @xmath15 and facilitating numerical estimates . in these units ,",
    "the orbital energy of a binary system with chirp mass @xmath113 is      the energy flux per unit time per unit area carried by a gw is @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are wave polarizations , the overbar means averaging over several cycles of the wave .",
    "switching to the frequency domain in usual way ( see , e.g. , thorne 1987 ) , we obtain        let us describe the stochastic backgrounds formed by many independent sources within unit logarithmic frequency interval at @xmath30 by the characteristic strain amplitude defined as ( cf .",
