    "the case when the level scheme is time dependent is of special interest , because the separation of the levels strongly influences the dynamics , e.g. , depending on the parameters , transitions may occur around an anticrossing . for a two - level system with a linearly time - dependent hamiltonian , the analytically solvable landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) model @xcite reflects the most important properties of the dynamics .",
    "phenomena that can be described using this model include the dynamics of molecular vibrations @xcite , multiphoton transitions and ionization of rydberg atoms @xcite , molecular nanomagnets @xcite and also quantum information processing with superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "multilevel and nonlinear generalizations of the lzs model have also been studied extensively ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the lzs model itself can describe the adiabatic limit , when the system follows the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian , as well as the case when a sudden transition takes place .",

    "this kind of interference is highly sensitive to dephasing and other decoherence mechanisms @xcite , which are the phenomena to be investigated in the present paper .",
    "we consider a two - level system driven by an external field leading to periodic anticrossings .",
    "mathematically , this is similar to the lzs model with harmonic terms replacing the usual linear ones in the hamiltonian .",
    "the spin @xmath0 system is assumed to be embedded in a thermal reservoir , and using floquet theory @xcite we introduce the appropriate master equation in a systematic way . investigating the dynamics induced by the master equation we determine the direction and time scale of the decoherence .",
    "we find that the time - dependent floquet states play the role of pointer states @xcite .",

    "our findings in the periodic case generalize the result that the multi - valuedness of the hysteresis curves in these systems reflects the relaxation towards the quasistationary ( equilibrium ) solutions , which are related to single - valued magnetization curves .",

    "however , both experimental and theoretical results show ( see eg .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) that the main source of decoherence is related to dipolar and hyperfine interactions which modify the local environment of the spins and eventually result in a distribution of the level splittings .",
    "investigating the dynamical properties of our system , it can be seen ( both analytically and numerically ) that this effect decreases the offdiagonal elements of the density matrix in the floquet basis .",
    "the characteristic time of the process depends on the width of the distribution of the level splittings , but if we take into account that a single period of the external field takes roughly 10 s , dephasing due to dipolar and hyperfine interactions is practically instantaneous .",
    "we note , however , that this kind of dephasing usually does not lead to a horizontal stationary magnetization curve , as even the incoherent sum of the floquet states has nontrivial time dependence .",
    "this implies that it is worth assuming that the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite reflect the interplay of fast dephasing due to the distribution of the level splittings and a much slower phonon induced process .",
    "therefore we calculated the dynamics with constantly zero offdiagonal density matrix elements in the floquet basis ( corresponding to instantaneous dephasing ) by the aid of the approximations that led us to eqs .",
    "( [ eigapprox ] ) . as it is shown by fig .",
    "[ lastfig ] , the value of @xmath172 1/s leads to qualitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "however , it is clear that decoherence rates @xmath108 are not variable parameters , their values are determined by the physical system we are considering . concretely , the value of @xmath89 in eq .",
    "[ gammas2 ] ( that can be calculated according to ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the scaling of @xmath173 as @xmath154 together determine the decoherence rates . in this procedure",
    "there are basically no free parameters ( apart from some uncertainty of the sound velocity in the molecular crystal ) and we obtained that @xmath174 is around 0.025 1/s , which , according to fig .  [ lastfig ] , is slightly too large , it leads to hysteresis curves with a few steps only .",
    "however , keeping in mind the approximate nature of our treatment ( considering not only the calculation of the floquet states ( [ eigapprox ] ) , but also the spin - phonon coupling operator , see eg .",
    "@xcite ) , we think that the methods developed in this paper provide a solid starting point for a theory that aims to describe nanomagnets driven by periodic magnetic fields in a quantitative way .",
    "concerning our current results , we can conclude that the thermal phonon bath alone can not be responsible for the experimentally observed ladder - like hysteresis curves , but taking the strong dephasing also into account , this kind of behavior can be explained .",
    "we investigated a two - level system which is driven by periodic external field and which is also in interaction with a thermal bath .",
    "it has been found that ",
    "independently from the decoherence rate , from the initial state and even from the type of the system - environment coupling  the time evolution is directed towards an appropriate incoherent sum of periodic floquet states .",
    "the final ratio of the populations related to these time dependent pointer states is determined by the parameters of the system hamiltonian , the type of the system - environment coupling and the temperature .",
    "our results show that the form of the quasistationary hysteresis curves is completely determined by the time evolution of the floquet states , while the rate of convergence towards these curves is related to the characteristic time of the decoherence . as an important example of the possible applications",
