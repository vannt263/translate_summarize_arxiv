    "the source of cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) with three generations is a phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "a precise measurement of the ckm matrix elements is one of the key issues in the study of @xmath9mesons and @xmath9factory experiments . in particular ,",
    "the accurate determination of @xmath10 is one of the most challenging problems in @xmath11 physics .",
    "its non - vanishing value is a necessary condition for cp violation to occur in the sm and its accurate value can put strong constraints even on the unitarity triangle : for instance , on the magnitude of the cp violating phase @xmath12 .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies for probing @xmath10 have been mostly focused on the semileptonic @xmath9meson decays .",
    "the present best experimental data for @xmath10 come from measurements of the exclusive decay @xmath13 and the inclusive decay @xmath14 , but these measurements suffer from large uncertainties due to model - dependence and other theoretical errors .",
    "for example , the cleo result obtained using the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath15 the opal data obtained using the inclusive decay @xmath14 @xcite : @xmath16 the method using the exclusive semileptonic decays involves hadronic form factors , such as @xmath17 or @xmath18 , whose values are heavily model - dependent and cause large uncertainties .",
    "the difficulty of using the inclusive charmless decay @xmath14 is in discriminating this process from the dominant background @xmath19 decay @xcite , whose branching ratio is more than 50 times larger than that of @xmath14 .    although traditional difficulties with the understanding of non - leptonic @xmath11 decays have prevented their use in determination of the ckm matrix elements , the possibility of measuring @xmath7 via non - leptonic decays of @xmath9mesons to exclusive or inclusive final states has been also theoretically explored @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study semi - inclusive charmless decays @xmath0 and investigate the possibility of extracting @xmath7 from these processes .",
    "compared to the exclusive decays , these semi - inclusive decays are generally expected to have less hadronic uncertainties and larger branching ratios .",
    "there are several possible processes in @xmath0 type decays , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 does not contain a charm ( anti)quark .",
    "the class of nonleptonic two - body decay modes and their advantages within general arguments were previously discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and semi - inclusive two - body decays within the qcd factorization were also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii we first classify all those @xmath0 processes , and we identify a certain mode , @xmath5 , whose analysis is theoretically clean and which can be used for determining @xmath7 .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii we study the mode @xmath5 in detail and propose a method to extract @xmath7 .",
    "that is , we calculate the branching ratio ( br ) of this mode using the full effective hamiltonian in the framework of the generalized factorization , and present the result as a function of @xmath7 with an estimation of possible uncertainties .",
    "we also consider the @xmath20 mixing effect through @xmath21 .",
    "the conclusions are in sec . iv .",
    "among the semi - inclusive charmless @xmath0 decays , let us first consider the mode @xmath5 .",
    "contributions for the decay amplitude of this mode arise from the color - favored tree ( @xmath22 ) diagram and the @xmath23 penguin diagram ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the tree diagram contribution dominates .    the charged pion @xmath24 in the final state can be produced via @xmath25boson emission at tree level and is expected to be energetic ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the decay amplitude can be approximated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes a hadronization function describing the combination of the @xmath29 pair to make the final state @xmath4 . to obtain the decay rate , @xmath30",
    "should be summed over all the possible states , such as @xmath31 , @xmath32 etc , so this process is effectively a _ two - body _ decay process of @xmath33 in the parton model approximation u$ ] , and can be approximated to the free quark decay of @xmath33 within the hqet . ] .",
    "thus , in this specific mode , no hadronic form factors ( except the pion decay constant @xmath34 ) are involved , and as a result the model - dependence does not appear to be severe .",
    "we note that the _ energetic _ charged pion should be _ positive _ so that such energetic @xmath24 can not be produced from the inclusive @xmath35 , @xmath32 , etc . ]",
    "@xmath24 in the final state can be a characteristic signal for this mode .",
    "we will show in fig .",
    "3 the decay distribution , @xmath36 , for @xmath5 as a function of the charged pion energy @xmath37 .",
    "( for a detailed explanation , see sec .",
    "iii . ) like a two - body decay , a peak appears around @xmath38 .",
    "now let us consider the mode @xmath39 . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , various contributions are responsible for this process : the color - favored tree diagram , the color - suppressed tree diagram , the @xmath23 and @xmath40 penguin diagrams . the color - favored tree contribution ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) and @xmath23 penguin contributions ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) are similar to those in @xmath5 , which are effectively two - body type ( @xmath33 ) processes .",
    "however , the color - suppressed tree ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) and other penguins ( fig .",
    "2(d ) ) differ from those in @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , these two diagrams correspond to effectively a _ three - body _ decay process of @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) in the parton model approximation , with the decay amplitude @xmath43 in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(d ) , the charged pion @xmath24 in the final state contains the spectator antiquark @xmath44 .",
    "so the analysis involves the hadronic form factor for the @xmath45 transition which is highly model - dependent .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath40 penguin contribution ( fig .",
    "2(d ) ) is not suppressed compared to the tree contributions , but dominant in this mode . the decay distribution , @xmath36 , for @xmath39",
    "will be shown in fig .",
    "4 , as a function of the charged pion energy @xmath37 .",
    "the three - body type contribution from the @xmath40 penguin is the dominant one .",
    "therefore , compared to the case of @xmath5 , the analysis of this mode is much more complicated and involves larger uncertainties .",
    "other modes of the type @xmath0 can be similarly classified .",
    "for instance , in the mode @xmath46 , the color - favored tree ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) diagrams and the @xmath23 and @xmath40 penguin diagrams are responsible for the decay process . in this case",
    ", the charged pion @xmath24 contains the spectator quark @xmath49 so that the process is effectively a three - body decay @xmath50 and the hadronic form factor for the @xmath45 transition is involved .",
    "other processes are basically a combination of the two - body decay process ( @xmath51 ) and the three - body decay process ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that the process @xmath5 is particularly interesting , because it is effectively the two - body decay process @xmath33 in the parton model approximation , and no uncertainty from hadronic form factors is involved .",
    "thus , its theoretical analysis is expected to be quite clean .",
    "the relevant @xmath53 effective hamiltonian for hadronic @xmath11 decays can be written as @xmath54   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & h.c.~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 s are defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 can be @xmath59 or @xmath60 quark , @xmath61 can be @xmath49 or @xmath62 quark , and @xmath63 is summed over @xmath59 , @xmath49 , @xmath62 , and @xmath60 quarks . @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the color indices .",
    "@xmath66 s are the wilson coefficients ( wc s ) , and we use the effective wc s for the process @xmath67 from ref.@xcite . the regularization scale is taken to be @xmath68 .",
    "the operators @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the tree level and qcd corrected operators , @xmath71 are the gluon induced strong penguin operators , and finally @xmath72 are the electroweak penguin operators due to @xmath73 and @xmath74 exchange , and the box diagrams at loop level .",
    "now we calculate the decay amplitude for the semi - inclusive decay @xmath5 , where @xmath4 can contain an up quark and a down antiquark . in the generalized factorization approximation ,",
