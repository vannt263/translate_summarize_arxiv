    "in spite of the great experimental successes of the standard model ( sm ) , we still do not have a direct test of its symmetry breaking sector .",
    "in fact , one may say that there is a tension arising from the indirect bounds on the higgs mass coming from the loop structure and precision measurements , which favours a higgs mass that is already excluded by direct searches .",
    "in addition , we already know that the sm is incomplete , since it does not provide for a viable dark matter candidate and for neutrino masses and mixings .    on a more theoretical side ,",
    "the sm is not satisfactory due to the triviality and hierarchy problems in the higgs sector .",
    "these problems suggest that the higgs sector should be viewed as an effective theory valid up to a certain energy scale .",
    "the traditional solutions to these problems used to be represented by two broad classes of models : supersymmetry and technicolor .",
    "recently a third class of solutions has been proposed , involving the existence of extra space - like compact dimensions @xcite .",
    "this class can be further divided in three different classes depending on the fields that can propagate in the extra dimensions and the geometry of these extra dimensions . in this letter",
    "we will concentrate on the so - called models of universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , where all fields can propagate in the flat compact extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "an important property of ued arises from momentum conservation in the extra dimensions .",
    "this implies that kk number is conserved in all tree level vertices . as a consequence contributions to electroweak observables",
    "arise only from loops of kk particles allowing compactification scales as low as @xmath0 gev @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the consequences of this model for higgs boson production at hadron colliders .",
    "the analysis of single higgs production in gluon fusion process was done by petriello @xcite and a significant enhancement compared to the sm was found .",
    "higgs pair production via gluon fusion in the sm was studied in @xcite and is an interesting process since it could give information on the higgs boson cubic coupling .",
    "hence it is important to examine possible deviations from sm predictions in different models .",
    "for instance , higgs pair production in little higgs models was studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the modifications of the higgs pair production cross section via gluon fusion in ued .",
    "in models of ued all fields are allowed to propagate in the bulk and hence they all have an associated kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower .",
    "we will work in the case of one additional compact dimension . in order to retain the zero modes corresponding to sm particles it is usual to compactify the extra dimension in an orbifold @xmath1 , defined by the identification @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the 5th dimension coordinate and @xmath4 is the compactification radius , and demand that the fields with zero modes to be even under the transformation @xmath5 .",

    "we implemented the new particles and couplings in feynarts @xcite for an arbitrary number of kk modes .",
    "we then use formcalc @xcite to perform the computation of traces and the reduction of the tensor one - loop integrals to scalar passarino - veltman integrals @xcite . finally , looptools @xcite computes numerically the integrals and cuba @xcite integrates over phase space to find the cross section .",
    "we verified that in the case of single higgs production in ued , where only a triangle diagram contributes , the program reproduces both analytically and numerically the results obtained by petriello @xcite .",
