    "an _ equivariant embedding _ of @xmath9 is by definition a @xmath8-equivariant injective morphism @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a finite - dimensional ( rational ) @xmath8-module , subject to the additional constraint that @xmath12 spans @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14-th ( higher ) secant variety @xmath15 of @xmath12 is the closure in @xmath13 of the union of all subspaces of @xmath13 spanned by @xmath14 points on @xmath12 .",

    "we want to compute the secant dimensions of @xmath12 for all @xmath9 of dimension at most @xmath0 and all @xmath18 .",
    "this statement really concerns only finitely many pairs @xmath19 : indeed , as @xmath9 is projective and @xmath8-homogeneous , the stabiliser of any point in @xmath9 is parabolic ( see @xcite ) and therefore contains the solvable radical @xmath20 of @xmath8 .",
    "but then @xmath20 also acts trivially on the span of @xmath12 , which is @xmath13 , so that we may replace @xmath8 by the quotient @xmath21 , which is semisimple .",
    "in addition , we may and will assume that @xmath8 is simply connected .",
    "now @xmath11 is an irreducible @xmath8-module , and @xmath12 is the unique closed orbit of @xmath8 in @xmath22 , the cone over which in @xmath11 is also known as the _ cone of highest weight vectors_. conversely , recall that for two dominant weights @xmath23 and @xmath24 the minimal orbits in the corresponding projective spaces @xmath25 and @xmath26 are isomorphic ( as @xmath8-varieties ) if and only if @xmath23 and @xmath24 have the same support on the basis of fundamental weights .",

    "we will prove our theorems using a polyhedral - combinatorial lower bound on higher secant dimensions introduced by the second author in @xcite .",

    "the tropical approach depends rather heavily on a parameterisation of @xmath9 , and in section [ sec : polynomialmap ] we introduce the polynomial maps that we will use .",
    "in particular , we give , for any minimal orbit ( not necessarily of low dimension , and not necessarily toric ) , a polynomial paramaterisation whose tropicalisation has an image of the right dimension ; these tropical parameterisations are useful in studying tropicalisations of minimal orbits ; see remark [ re : tropicalminorbit ] .",
