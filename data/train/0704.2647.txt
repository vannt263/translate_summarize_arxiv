    "one of the central issues in the general theory of relativity has always been the question of gravitational radiation . historically , the first gravitational radiation problem considered was the radiation from a spinning rod [ 2,3 ] .",
    "one of the important issues of gravitational radiation is the gravitational collapse .",
    "general relativity suggests that gravitational collapse of massive objects results in the formation of spacetime singularities in our universe [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "the known physical laws break down very near to the spacetime singularity . at this stage ,",
    "quantum theory of gravity is applied to describe the physical phenomena in the neighbourhood of the spacetime singularity .",
    "one of the important issues `` whether the spacetime singularities , ( far from the region where the gravitational collapse occurs ) formed in our universe , can be seen by observer or not '' has attracted many people .",
    "penrose [ 7 ] investigated this problem and suggested a cosmic censorship hypothesis .",
    "this hypothesis includes two versions , one is called _ strong version _ and other is called _ weak",
    "version_. according to the strong version , a spacetime singularity formed by non - singular initial data is not visible from infinity while according to the weak version , a spacetime singularity formed by non - singular initial data is invisible for any observer [ 8 ] . the singularity claimed by the strong version is named as naked singularity , while the singularity claimed by the weak version is known as globally naked singularity .",
    "nakamura et al . [ 9 ] conjectured that large spacetime curvatures move away to infinity in the form of gravitational radiation in the neighbourhood of globally naked singularities ( if exist ) .",
    "the spherically symmetric systems are considered to be very useful [ 10 ] to discuss the problem of naked singularity formation .",
    "these systems are simple and have well - defined physical significance .",
    "we shall take non - spherical perturbations to this system [ 11 ] to study the problem of gravitational radiation .",
    "we consider cylindrically symmetric system because there is a degree of gravitational radiation and the spacetime singularity formed in this system is naked [ 12,13 ] .",
    "there is a great literature [ 14 - 19 ] available on gravitational radiation through cylindrical gravitational collapse . some numerical work on the gravitational radiation has also been done by different people [ 20 - 22 ] .",
    "recently , nakao and morisawa [ 1 ] have discussed the gravitational collapse of a cylindrical thick shell composed of a perfect fluid to the case of non - vanishing pressure .",
    "same authors [ 23 ] have also specialized this work for the complete dust case .",
    "these investigations have provided interesting results about the gravitational collapse .",
    "this paper has been addressed for the high - speed cylindrical collapse of the two perfect fluids .",
    "we use high - speed approximation scheme by considering perturbation analysis . for this purpose ,",
    "the collapsing speeds of the two perfect fluids are assumed almost equal to the speed of light .",
    "further , we take the deviation of the 4-velocities of the two fluids from null as a small perturbation .",
    "we investigate the effects of the pressures for the large collapsing velocities .",
    "it is verified that our results reduce to the perfect fluid case as obtained by nakao and morisawa [ 1 ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is outlined as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the basic structure of the spacetime with whole - cylinder symmetry [ 24 ] .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discuss the high - speed approximation scheme for the two perfect fluids . in section 4",
    ", we interpret the effects of pressures of the two fluids on the high - speed gravitational collapse .",
    "finally , section 5 contains summary and discussion .",
    "the spacetime with the whole - cylinder symmetry is given by the line element [ 24 ] @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 only .",
    "einstein field equations ( efes ) are given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ricci tensor , @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , @xmath10 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath11 is the gravitational constant .",
    "these equations for ( 2.1 ) take the following form @xmath12 where dot and prime represent differentiation w.r.t . @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "there is a literature available [ 25,26 ] which shows interesting investigation of the combination of two different fluids .",
    "e.g. hall [ 25 ] presented eight different combinations and investigated their physical as well as mathematical properties .",
    "here we have taken one of these combination which is more simpler and has obvious interesting properties due to perfect fluid combination .",
    "this system of two perfect fluid is also used to obtain kinematic self - similar solutions of the einstein field equations [ 27 ] . for the sake of simplicity , we have taken only two fluids instead of taking arbitrary .",
    "we consider the non - interacting combination of two ( non - zero ) perfect fluids where their ( unit , time - like , future - pointing ) flow vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 are assumed non - parallel . if these fluids have densities @xmath15 and pressures @xmath1 , the energy - momentum tensor for two perfect fluid system [ 25 ] is given by @xmath16 it is assumed not only that the separate dominant energy conditions hold , but that the extra conditions @xmath17 hold and so @xmath18 .",
    "the segre type is @xmath19 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath20 ( repeated ) , where @xmath21\\}^\\frac{1}{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so @xmath22 .",
    "it is obvious that if energy - momentum tensor represents a perfect fluid with @xmath23 , then it uniquely determines the fluid flow @xmath24 and the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for the combination of two perfect fluids ,",
    "the physical characteristics of the fluid represented by the flow vector , the pressure , and the density are uniquely determined .",
    "since @xmath10 uniquely determines its eigenvalues , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are determined and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined to within an interchange of their values .",
    "consequently , for each choice of the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , there is a one - parameter family of values for the quadruple @xmath31 restricted by the requirements that @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the components of the 4-velocity @xmath24 for the fluid 1 of the whole - cylinder symmetry take the form [ 1 ] @xmath34 since @xmath24 is time - like , u is positive . using the normalization property , i.e. , @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath36 is written as @xmath37 similarly , for the fluid 2 , the 4-velocity will become @xmath38 where @xmath39 turns out to be @xmath40 we define the new variables @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 corresponding to the two fluids as @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath47 .",
    "the non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath48 turn out to be @xmath49 equation for the conservation of energy - momentum , i.e. , @xmath50 corresponding to the two fluids can be written in the component form as @xmath51 @xmath52'\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{d_1}{2}\\{2\\partial_u(\\psi-\\gamma ) -u(\\dot{\\psi}-\\dot{\\gamma})\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{d_2}{2}\\{2\\partial_u(\\psi-\\gamma ) -v(\\dot{\\psi}-\\dot{\\gamma})\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\{u(2-u)p_1+v(2-v)p_2\\}(\\gamma'-\\psi'+\\frac{r'}{r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the retarded time , @xmath54 is the advanced time and @xmath55 is the partial derivative w.r.t .",
    "the first of these equations is obtained from the @xmath6-component and the second is obtained from the @xmath7-component .",
    "the @xmath56- and @xmath57-components vanish .",
    "the energy flux of gravitational radiation can be found by considering the c - energy e and its flux vector .",
    "the c - energy is defined as [ 24 ] @xmath58 where @xmath59.the corresponding energy flux vector @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 where @xmath60 satisfies the conversation law . when we make use of eqs.(2.3 ) ,",
    "( 2.4 ) and ( 2.24 ) in eq.(2.25 ) , the c - energy flux vector can be written in component form as @xmath62 the remaining components vanish .",
    "in this section we use linear perturbation analysis w.r.t . a small parameter @xmath63 .",

    "we take the deviation of the four - velocities from a null as a perturbation and perform linear perturbation analysis .",
    "it can be found that for the collapsing two null dusts , the solution is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an arbitrary function of @xmath14 .",
    "this solution has been investigated by many people [ 14,16,17 ] .",
    "we take this solution as a background spacetime for the perturbation analysis .",
    "it follows from eqs .(3.4 ) and ( 3.9 ) that the energy - momentum tensor diverges at the symmetry axis @xmath77 if @xmath78 and @xmath79 do not vanish simultaneously . using einstein field equations , the same behaviour can also be shown for the ricci tensor .",

    ". some previous studies [ 16 ] show that although the kretschmann scalar vanishes , the tidal forces felt by freely falling test particles may become unbounded .",
    "this indicates that a non - scalar or intermediate singularity is formed there [ 28,29 ] .",

    "then it follows from eqs.(3.16 ) and ( 3.17 ) that @xmath101 is constant in the vacuum region .",
    "thus up to the first order , the c - energy is constant in the vacuum region .",
    "this implies that , up to the first order in @xmath63 , the c - energy flux vector @xmath60 vanishes and up to the second - order in @xmath63 , it is given in component form as @xmath102 it follows from here that the c - energy flux vector corresponds to the massless klein - gordon field .",
    "in this section , we discuss the consequences of the pressures on the high - speed collapse .",
    "we take energy densities @xmath15 and pressures @xmath1 of the two fluids positive and define the following quantities @xmath103 where the subscript @xmath104 stands for speed .",
    "when the dominant energy conditions are satisfied , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are less than or equal to the speed of light [ 30 ] . in this paper",

    "now we consider the following two cases : + ( i ) when @xmath105 and @xmath106 are bounded below by some positive constant ; + ( ii ) when @xmath105 and @xmath106 vanish for @xmath118 .      here",
    "we take @xmath105 and @xmath106 as bounded below by some positive constants @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively .",
    "it follows that the following inequalities hold @xmath121 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are non - vanishing constants . using eqs.(4.11 ) and",

    "this shows that the perturbation velocities @xmath117 diverge at the symmetric axis @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , the high - speed approximation scheme breaks down in this case .      in this case",
    ", we investigate the behavior of the two perfect fluids when @xmath0 vanish for the high energy density limits , i.e. , @xmath118 .",
    "the energy densities will become larger and larger when the fluid elements approach the background singularity , i.e. , @xmath77 , ( the region of @xmath125 ) .",

    "the failure of the high - speed approximation scheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the uncertainity on the evolution at and after this time . in the bounded case , the naked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two perfect fluids . for the vanishing case",
    ", it is shown that in the limit of high energy densities , @xmath118 , the high - speed collapse continues until a naked singularity forms . alternatively ,",
    "if a linear equation of state is used such that @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath138 with @xmath139 , the high - speed collapse does not break down by the effects of pressures and consequently a naked singularity forms .",
    "it follows from eq.(3.20 ) that the large amount of gravitational radiation can be measured with the increase of the velocity perturbations @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "this means that the cylindrical two perfect fluids with @xmath105 and @xmath106 bounded below by some positive values will emit more gravitational waves in its collapse due to the unbounded increase in @xmath136 and @xmath137 which breaks down the high speed approximation scheme .",
    "however , for the vanishing of @xmath0 in the high energy density limit , @xmath117 are finite even at the background singularity .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath0 would generate the larger amount of gravitational radiation keeping the perturbation velocities finite . also , high speed approximation scheme remains valid here .",
    "this shows the similarity of the behavior with the dust case and consequently generates the larger amount of gravitational radiation .",
    "it is mentioned here that if we take @xmath140 or @xmath141 all the results reduce to the cylindrical perfect fluid case [ 1 ] .",
    "it would be interesting to explore this problem by taking some other symmetry .",
