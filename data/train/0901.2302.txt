    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are believed to form in single bursts of star formation within protocluster clouds , producing bound clusters of @xmath1  @xmath2 stars which ( in most cases ) share a single age , metallicity , and element abundance pattern .",
    "a near - universal feature of the gcs in any one large galaxy is that they typically follow a _ bimodal _ metallicity distribution , a conclusion now based solidly on large statistical samples from many galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a more recently discovered second - order feature in the metallicity distributions , that seems particularly to affect the metal - poor component , is a _ mass - metallicity relation _",
    "( mmr ) : the blue clusters become slightly but significantly more metal - rich at progressively higher mass @xcite .",
    "no such correlation is seen along the metal - richer , red gc sequence .",
    "this feature , also colloquially called a `` blue tilt '' , is as yet poorly understood , and the various empirical characterizations of the effect are not yet in mutual agreement , even including the extreme claim that it is only an artifact of measurement @xcite .",
    "some discussions of the mmr in a few individual galaxies claim to find a systematic correlation of cluster metallicity ( color ) with mass ( luminosity ) that spans the entire gc luminosity range @xcite .",
    "however , the observational studies based on the biggest statistical samples ( thousands of gcs collected from many large e galaxies ) , and carried out with the best photometric measurement techniques ( with careful attention to aperture - size corrections determined from convolutions of the gc profiles with the point - spread function of the image ) find that the slope of the mmr becomes most noticeable for the top end of the gc mass range , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "for the vast majority of lower - mass clusters , their mean color stays virtually constant and it is debatable whether or not any significant mmr trend exists for @xmath8 .    the fact that the mmr becomes prominent only at the high - mass , high - luminosity end of the gc sequence easily explains why it was not discovered until recently .",
    "massive gcs are rare , and for galaxies with relatively small gc populations ( such as the milky way , any dwarfs , or any non - giant ellipticals ) , the gc distribution simply can not be traced to high enough levels for any systematic change in cluster color with luminosity to be noticed . in the milky way , for example , only @xmath9 centauri is luminous and massive enough to be clearly in the `` mmr regime '' @xcite . to make the picture additionally puzzling ,",
    "one or two giant ellipticals seem to have no discernable mmr at any luminosity level ( most notably ngc 4472 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is not out of the question that the amplitude of the effect may differ from one galaxy to another .",
    "two other lines of observational evidence have recently emerged to hint more strongly that the systematic properties of gcs start to undergo important changes at around the million - solar - mass point .",
    "one of these is their characteristic radii ( usually described by their half - light or effective radius @xmath10 , which is relatively immune to dynamical evolution ) .",
    "empirically , @xmath10 stays relatively uniform at @xmath11 pc for luminosities @xmath12 ( corresponding roughly to @xmath13 ) , but follows a steeper relation roughly approximated by @xmath14 at higher luminosities @xcite .",
    "this changeover in their structural - parameter plane may smoothly link the most massive gcs with other objects such as ucds ( ultra - compact dwarfs ) and the compact nuclei in dwarf ellipticals .",
    "lastly , evidence gathered from detailed color - magnitude studies and abundance measurements of gcs within the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is now showing that the most massive gcs ( again , those typically above about @xmath0 ) are often not the clean `` single stellar population '' that is classically associated with gcs ; instead , they can show two or more distinct sequences in their color - magnitude diagram that are indicators of more than one generation of stars with different chemical abundances .",
    "gc formation models to explain and link all these intriguing characteristics of gcs at different masses are still in rudimentary stages . in this paper",
    ", we develop a new quantitative model to address particularly the metallicity distributions of gcs and their systematic change with mass .",
    "our model assumes that a globular cluster in the process of formation can be _ pre - enriched _ ( that is , its protocluster gas will have an initial heavy - element abundance produced by any generations of stars that happened previously ) , and also _ self - enriched _",
    "( that is , its own first rounds of supernova can further increase its mean metallicity ) .",
    "our model is intended to explore which of these factors will be dominant in a given situation , and whether the combination is capable of describing the metallicity distribution for real gcs .    because all timescales associated with the formation and evolution of stars decrease strongly with increasing stellar mass , it is possible for the first high - mass stars in a protocluster to form , live their entire lives , and explode as supernovae ( sne ) while the lower - mass stars are still forming .",
    "the metals produced from high - mass stars within a protocluster may therefore be incorporated into the lower - mass stars in the same starburst ( self - enrichment ) . in this case",
    ", the mean metallicity of the final cluster will reflect several factors including the initial mass function ( imf ) of star formation , the efficiency with which the protocloud gas is turned into stars , and the ability of protoclusters to hold on to the metals produced by its sne ( which will be primarily a function of the cloud mass ) . because the number of sne in a protocluster may be subject to small - number statistics",
    ", the amount of metal enrichment can be quite stochastic @xcite , resulting in a metallicity spread that itself will be a function of cluster mass .",
    "recently @xcite have published a formation model for gcs also based on the idea of self - enrichment .",
    "we compare their discussion with ours in more detail in a later section below .",
    "we believe that key differences in the assumptions regarding the protocloud structure and formation timescales make our model more physically realistic , and as will be seen below , make it possible to identify the intriguing `` transition point '' around @xmath0 in a more natural way .",
    "previous descriptions of gc and star - cluster formation usually make the zero - order approximation of an `` instantaneous starburst '' in which the entire stellar imf springs into place at once . at some level",
    "this must be an oversimplification : individual stars have formation times that depend on their mass , and the starburst epoch as a whole will be stretched out over a comparable length of time .",
    "our model of self - enrichment is based instead on the picture that many or most of the high - mass stars form , live , die , and eject their newly formed heavy elements into the surroundings before the low - mass stars have finished assembling a significant fraction of their mass .",
    "this scenario , too , must at some level be an idealization , but there is now significant evidence on both the observational and theoretical sides to justify it as a useful first - order approximation .    in the context of globular cluster self - enrichment , `` high mass ''",
    "stars are those that contribute significantly to the total metal production from the stellar population while `` low mass '' stars are those that are still visible today in a milky way gc .",
    "the majority of metals are produced in supernovae with progenitor masses of at least @xmath15 ( see figure  [ cumulative metals ] ) , while the upper mass limit for `` low mass '' stars relevant here will be the main - sequence turnoff mass of typical gcs in large galaxies , @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the important _ stellar _ timescales are the combined formation and evolution timescale of stars of at least @xmath15 compared to the formation timescales of stars of less than @xmath17 .",
    "the timescales associated with high - mass star formation are extremely short .",
    "@xcite has shown that the dynamics of molecular outflows in massive star forming regions require very high accretion rates that imply formation timescales of @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath18  yr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* who infer that the formation times for massive stars are @xmath19 myr ) . once formed , the evolutionary lifetime of high mass stars is similarly short .",
    "@xcite calculates lifetimes of @xmath20  myr for @xmath15 stars down to @xmath21  myr for stars of @xmath22 or greater , and @xcite model combined effect of metal production and stellar ages and find that most metals are released within the first @xmath23  myr after the first @xmath24 star dies ( see their figure  6 ) .",
    "the timescale for the supernova ejecta to cool is similar , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "therefore , even though stars with masses as low as @xmath26 may explode as supernovae , the key timescale for enrichment is much shorter than the @xmath27  myr lifetime of those stars . in short ,",
    "a reasonable estimate appears to be that the high - mass part of the imf can ` seed ' its surroundings beginning around 5 myr after formation .    on the other hand ,",
    "the formation times for low mass stars are much longer .",
    "the formation timescale should be approximately the kelvin - helmholz time , which rises to @xmath28  yr for @xmath29 ( see figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , even if all stars in a given starburst begin to form simultaneously , the heavy elements from the high mass stars will be ejected into the protocluster cloud while the low mass stars are still collapsing .",
    "in fact , simulations that couple hydrodynamics with radiative transfer suggest that feedback from high mass stars critically shapes the low mass imf itself @xcite , providing direct evidence that feedback from high mass stars is important early in the formation of lower mass stars .    these comments still do not include the internal structure of the starburst as a whole .",
    "the turbulent medium in which star formation occurs is theoretically expected to result in clumpy star formation , as is seen observationally in dense star - forming regions today ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both in the spatial structure of the protocluster and in its temporal evolution over the star formation episode .",
    "these studies indicate that the total durations of starbursts in massive , dense protocluster clouds such as the ones we are particularly interested in here are plausibly in the range of @xmath30 myr .",
    "intervals this long give the low - mass stars that are formed throughout the burst additional time to incorporate metals ejected by the higher - mass stars formed at the onset of the burst . while we will not address the effects of this internal structure on the process of cluster self - enrichment any further , it may be expected to introduce star - to - star metallicity dispersion within the cluster ; inhomogeneities of this sort have indeed been detected in some massive gcs ( see the references cited above ) .",
    "we begin by analyzing the simplest case , where the metal content of clusters comes entirely from self - enrichment , in order to address whether it can be the dominant contributor .",
    "we expand this analysis to include contributions from both self - enrichment and pre - enrichment in ",

    "we assume a salpeter slope of @xmath37 , which is an excellent fit to the observed imf at @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "although the low mass imf has large uncertainties , it is known to turn over and therefore contain only a small fraction of the total stellar mass .",
    "our derivation only requires that ( a ) the high - mass slope of the imf and ( b ) the total fraction of mass contained in high mass stars are correct .",
    "we may therefore assume a salpeter imf with an appropriate low mass cutoff @xmath35  without loss of generality .",

    "we assume that a fraction @xmath59 of the metals produced stays within the the cloud and ends up incorporated in the formation of the lower - mass stars .",

    "furthermore , @xmath32 and @xmath59 may in principle vary as a function of cloud mass . for example , the fraction of metals that remain bound to the cloud should increase with the depth of the gravitational potential well , and therefore @xmath59 may increase with mass .",
    "this by itself would introduce a positive mass - metallicity relation in the same sense as the observations listed above .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in   [ fz estimate section ] ; @xcite make an argument that is basically similar .",
    "next , we extend the above derivation to determine the expected cluster - to - cluster _ dispersion _ in the gc metallicity distribution , due to the stochastic nature of self - enrichment @xcite .",
    "this will turn out to yield an interesting constraint on the relative importance of pre- and self - enrichment .",
    "first we note that the mean number of supernovae in a given gc , @xmath72 , is : @xmath73    the variance in the mass of metals expelled by a single sn is : @xmath74 where @xmath75,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath76 with @xmath62 taken from equation  ( [ mz deriv ] ) .",

    "it is a direct consequence of the fact that higher cluster mass yields larger numbers of sne and so reduces the statistical fluctuations in the enrichment , regardless of how much gas is lost .",
    "this relationship , including normalization , is therefore a robust testable prediction of the model .",
    "we next generate a monte carlo realization of this process to demonstrate the stochastic effects more explicitly .",
    "we begin by randomly sampling cloud masses @xmath31 from a mass function for protocluster molecular clouds of the form @xmath80 between a minimum mass @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xcite estimate a slightly shallower slope for the mass function , @xmath83 , but our results are entirely insensitive to its value ) .    for each cloud , we calculate the mean number of stars expected , @xmath84 : @xmath85 @xmath86 and round it to the nearest integer .",
    "we then randomly sample @xmath84 stars from the imf and find the stellar mass of the cluster , @xmath43 , by taking their sum .",

    "we calculate the mass of metals it produces using equation  ( [ ww ] ) , and finally calculate the metallicity of the cloud by summing up the contributions from each sn and multiplying by @xmath88 .    the results of @xmath89 monte carlo models with a minimum cloud mass of @xmath90 ( so that the minimum @xmath43  is constant ) , along with the results from the analytic derivations , are given in figure  [ zvsm ] .",
    "it can be seen that the analytic results and the monte carlo samples are completely consistent , and that the free parameters @xmath32 and @xmath59 only affect the mean metallicity and not the scatter at a given globular cluster mass .",
    "we plot the number of supernovae per cluster in figure  [ nsn plot ] .",
    "the average is @xmath91 sn for every @xmath24 of stars formed .",
    "thus , for example , a @xmath92 globular cluster  that is , an object that is thought of as a classically `` normal '' gc  will experience on average @xmath93 supernovae during its formation .",
    "note that the spread in cluster metallicities is not simply the poisson error of the number of supernovae , but is also due to the spread in possible metal contributions of each individual supernova .",
    "for example , the relative poisson error on @xmath93 supernovae is @xmath94 , while the actual metallicity spread for clusters of @xmath95 is a factor of two larger .",
    "lastly , we emphasize that the calculations so far assume a _",
    "constant _ gas retention fraction @xmath59 , so that the mean self - enrichment is independent of cluster mass .",
    "this assumption is rather obviously unrealistic , since at small enough protocluster masses the first few supernovae will remove all the gas and fail to generate any enrichment .",

    "the observed cluster - to - cluster metallicity spread is over an order of magnitude larger than the spread predicted by our self - enrichment model at most cluster masses .",
    "if self enrichment were the dominant source of metals in the metal - poor globular cluster population , then the observed and predicted scatter should be similar , and should be correlated with cluster luminosity .",
    "the dramatic discrepancy between the observed and predicted spread , along with the absence of any observed relation between cluster luminosity and metallicity spread , _ strongly suggests that self - enrichment is not the dominant source of the heavy elements in most metal - poor globular clusters_. we conclude that these clusters must have taken their heavy - element compositions from the protocluster clouds before star formation began ( `` pre enrichment '' ) , and that the observed scatter reflects the variety of environments in which clusters formed .",
    "in   [ mean metallicity ] , we derived an upper limit of @xmath71 for the metal retention efficiency based on the mean metallicity of metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "moreover , the upper boundary @xmath106 corresponds to clusters whose metals are entirely contributed by self - enrichment , while we concluded in   [ obscomp section ] that self - enrichment can not be the dominant source of metals .",
    "it is natural to ask whether such low values for @xmath59 are physically plausible . in this section ,",
    "we develop a simple energetics argument to obtain a rough estimate for @xmath59 and explore the consequences of the mass - dependent metal retention that naturally arises ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the potential within the cloud is given by @xmath109    the total kinetic energy imparted into the cluster gas is the sum of the energy injected by each supernova . in principle , the important quantity is the number of supernovae that explode within a cooling time , and therefore the supernova _ rate _ , rather than the total number , is important .",
    "however , in practice the timescale for high - mass star formation is expected to be @xmath110 ( see discussion in   [ timescale section ] ) , sufficiently shorter than the @xmath25 in which a supernova bubble remains hot @xcite that all of the cluster supernovae can be approximated as simultaneous .",

    "it is apparent that @xmath124 for most cluster masses , as required by our argument that self - enrichment is unimportant .",

    "the color - magnitude data @xcite in @xmath145 show the usual presence of the blue and red sequences , but the red sequence displays an unusually high upward extension that may connect to the ucd mass regime at @xmath146 and above @xcite and also shows a small ` swing ' in mean color further toward the red .",
    "we have overplotted our model predictions , assuming the following transformations , @xmath147 @xmath148 ( based on * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and assuming a star formation efficiency @xmath149 . the slight reduction in @xmath32 from the fiducial value of @xmath98 is required in order to fit the luminosity",
    "at which the mmr begins ; the sensitive dependence of @xmath132 on @xmath32 in equation  ( [ mretain gc ] ) means that very little change is required . in figure",
    "[ ngc3311 ] , it can be seen that the strong mmr of the metal - poor population and the mild mmr of the metal - rich population are both well reproduced in our model .",
    "we believe that new searches for this mmr effect at the high - mass end of _ both _ red and blue sequences would be an extremely effective test of the basic features of our model .",
    "they would best be looked for in individual supergiant ellipticals with the largest possible gc samples .",
    "our numerical results may be influenced by the particular values we have adopted for parameters that are either unconstrained or that have significant uncertainty .",
    "we address here the influence that each of these parameters has on our numerical and qualitative conclusions .",
    "the imf is defined by three parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath150 .",
    "changes of @xmath151 in @xmath35  result in changes of @xmath23@xmath152 in both the metallicity and its cluster - to - cluster scatter , while changes of @xmath151 in @xmath36  result in changes of @xmath153 to the metallicity and its scatter .",
    "flattening the slope of the imf to @xmath154 increases the mean metallicity by a factor of two , while steepening it to @xmath155 decreases the mean metallicity by @xmath156 ; however , the changes to the scatter are in both cases less than @xmath157 . because changes to @xmath150 result in changes to the mean metallicity that are comparable to the observed scatter , scatter in @xmath150 between clusters could increase the predicted metallicity scatter to the observed level , assuming that the other parameters of the imf are kept constant .",
    "however , this is likely a poor assumption : the fraction of the stellar mass contained in high - mass stars , which determines the number of supernovae and therefore the poisson scatter , is a more robust quantity than the value of each parameter of the imf .",
    "we conclude that our qualitative results are robust to any realistic uncertainty in the imf .",
    "because our equation for the heavy - element yields is fit to a small number of models in @xcite and @xcite , there is considerable uncertainty in the parameters .",
    "however , our results are completely insensitive to the @xmath158 parameter in equation  ( [ ww ] ) , and while changes in the @xmath159 parameter result in proportional changes to the mean predicted metallicity , they have no effect on the metallicity scatter .",
    "another method of effectively changing the supernova yield is to change the minimum supernova progenitor mass , @xmath57 .",
    "however , most of the metals are produced by stars with masses @xmath160 , and so changes in @xmath57  have no noticable effect on either the mean metallicity or its scatter .",
    "another potential source of metallicity scatter is from metallicity - dependent supernova yields .",
    "if the mass of metals ejected from supernovae depended strongly on the metallicity of the progenitor star , then a small scatter in pre - enrichment levels could be leveraged into a large scatter in final metallicity .",
    "however , while the yields of individual elements vary significantly with progenitor metallicity , the total heavy element yields in the supernova models of @xcite are very similar for models with initial metallicities ranging from @xmath161 to @xmath162 , ruling out this possibility .",
    "the predicted metallicity scatter for self enrichment is entirely independent of the mean value of the star formation efficiency , @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , uncertainty in its value does not alter our conclusions .",
    "however , cloud - to - cloud _ scatter _ in the star formation efficiency translates directly into metallicity scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore can not rule out a large mass - independent variation in @xmath32 as an explanation for the observed metallicity scatter among metal - poor galactic gcs .",
    "however , our metal retention model of   [ fz estimate section ] suggests that if self - enrichment were important , there would be an observable mmr for these clusters ( only clusters with masses @xmath163 would exhibit no mmr , a regime that galactic gcs clearly do not inhabit ) , which is not observed .",
    "the metal retention efficiency , @xmath59 , occupies a similar role as @xmath32 : its mean value has no effect on the predicted metallicity scatter in the self enrichment model , but cloud - to - cloud _ scatter _ in @xmath59 translates directly into metallicity scatter .",
    "we therefore can not rule out a large mass - independent variation in @xmath59 as an explanation for the observed metallicity scatter , but again note that the mmr that would be expected in the case of self - enrichment is not observed for the galactic gcs .",
    "possible scatter in @xmath59 due to stochastic effects is discussed in   [ stochastic retention ] , while scatter in @xmath59 due to scatter in cluster radii at a given mass is discussed in more detail in   [ rt scatter ] .",
    "we have assumed that the global heavy element enrichment and feedback energetics are dominated by core - collapse supernovae ( i.e. types ib and ii ) .",
    "stellar winds from stars of a wider range of mass contribute significant amounts of some individual elements , but are not believed to dominate the global enrichment and are certainly unimportant energetically in comparison to supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the metal contribution from stellar winds , i.e. from more common lower - mass stars , is higher than currently believed , the metallicity scatter due to self enrichment would be further reduced from the values we derive .",
    "our conclusion that self enrichment produces too little metallicity spread is therefore robust to the heavy element contribution from stellar winds .      in the previous picture ,",
    "all supernovae simultaneously enrich and deposit energy into the protocluster cloud , which becomes well mixed and subsequently loses some fraction of its mass , and so a fraction @xmath59 of _ each _ supernova s metals are retained .",
    "another possible source of scatter is stochastic metal retention . in this picture , the individual supernovae pepper the cloud one at a time , and initially all metals are retained , but eventually one supernova injects enough energy that the total remaining gas can be unbound .",
    "then , without any remaining gaseous envelope , the ejecta from all subsequent supernovae can escape freely and the enrichment stops . in this picture ,",
    "a fraction @xmath59 of the supernovae have _ all _ of their metals retained , while _ no _ metals are retained from the remainder .",
    "the effective number of supernovae is then reduced from @xmath72to @xmath164 , and the stochastic relative scatter is increased by a factor of @xmath165 ( this can be thought of as a special case of scatter in @xmath59 , which is discussed above ) . for @xmath166 , the metallicity scatter would be increased by a factor of @xmath167 .",
    "this factor is well below the order of magnitude required to reconcile the observed and predicted metallicity scatter .",
    "the adopted isothermal density profile for the protocluster cloud , equation  ( [ tsis ] ) , is as steep a profile as can be realistically maintained , and is physically well motivated .",
    "however , clouds may exist with slightly shallower density profiles .",
    "we therefore briefly expand the derivation of ",
    "[ fz estimate section ] to generic power - law profiles .    if the density within the truncation radius is given by @xmath168 then for @xmath169",
    "the metal retention efficiency is @xmath170^{\\frac{3-\\beta}{2-\\beta}}. \\label{fz beta}\\ ] ] we have plotted this relation for a few slopes in figure  [ fz plot ] , in addition to the fiducial @xmath171 tsis case .",
    "it is apparent that although the @xmath171 case has a unique functional form , it is not `` critical '' in the sense of showing fundamentally different behaviour ; in all cases , the metal retention turns over sharply near @xmath131 .",
    "the qualitative effect of a shallower density profile is that a greater fraction of the gas is located near the edge of the cloud where it can be more easily unbound ; @xmath59 therefore decreases when @xmath172 is lowered , and shows a sharper transition to the self - enriched regime .      in ",
    "[ fz estimate section ] we assumed that all protocluster clouds have a constant radius independent of mass . while this is true for observed gcs with @xmath13 , a mass - radius relation emerges at higher masses , with radii rising from @xmath11 pc at @xmath173 to @xmath174 pc at @xmath175 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the truncation radius scales similarly as the half - mass radius , we parametrize the mass - radius relation as follows : @xmath176 and examine the consequences on our previous results .",
    "the case @xmath177 corresponds to simple virial equilibrium and @xmath178 to constant density .",
    "the available data , accumulated from a combination of the most massive known gcs , ucds , and de nuclei , indicate @xmath179 ( see the references cited above ) , which we adopt here .    with this scaling",
    ", the metal retention efficiency becomes @xmath180 where we define the critical metal retention mass in the absence of a mass - radius relation @xmath181 as in equation  ( [ mretain gc ] ) .",
    "the correct critical retention mass @xmath131  is unchanged if @xmath182 , but otherwise increases by a factor of @xmath183 for @xmath184 , the exponent in the equation above is just @xmath185 .",
    "for example , if we adopt @xmath186 as the transition to the mass - radius relation , then the critical retention mass increases by a factor of @xmath187 to @xmath188 .",
    "we have plotted our predicted @xmath59 and mass - metallicity relations in figure  [ massrad ] , assuming the above mass - radius relation with @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "we have also plotted the original relations , where the cluster radius is assumed to be constant , for comparison .",
    "we note that the increased radius of high - mass clusters reduces their metal retention because of the shallower potential well , and therefore moves the scale of self - enrichment to higher mass .",
    "however , it also results in a shallower mass dependence , more similar to the observed mmrs , and therefore the scale at which self - enrichment becomes apparent ( which is approximately where the dotted and dashed lines cross in figure  [ massrad]b ) is less drastically affected than the factor of @xmath23 difference in @xmath132 .",
    "lastly , we consider the _ scatter _ in cloud radius at a given mass and its effect on @xmath59 .",
    "the observed scatter in @xmath10 for gcs in the milky way is @xmath191 in @xmath192 ( with data from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; i.e. , @xmath193 . as discussed in ",
    "[ caveat : fz ] , @xmath59 scatter translates directly into metallicity scatter .",
    "we therefore must determine whether the scatter in @xmath108 can help reconcile the self - enrichment model with the observed metallicity scatter .",
    "first , we note that the exponential dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath108 in equation  ( [ fz therm ] ) implies : @xmath194 from ",
    "[ mean metallicity ] , we determined @xmath71 . with @xmath195 ,",
    "the implied scatter on @xmath59 is @xmath196 .",
    "this increase in predicted scatter is sufficient to account for the observed metallicity scatter amongst low mass gcs .    while this appears to invalidate our argument in   [ z spread section ] that the magnitude of the observed metallicity scatter rules out self - enrichment as the dominant mode of metal enrichment , there are critical problems with this explanation .",
    "first , it is sensitive to the detailed form of @xmath59 , which we do not claim is robust . for example , some previous studies of self - enrichment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have modelled the effects of supernovae as a step - function switch where the protocluster is completely disrupted below a critical mass , but survives intact with full metal retention ( @xmath197 ) above it ; in such a case , the scatter in @xmath108 would not increase the metallicity scatter of the extant clusters at all .",
    "second , the increased scatter is a direct result of the fact that @xmath59 is a function of the depth of the potential well , which is proportional to @xmath198 . in other words , it is intimately tied to the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath31 and the existence of a mass - metallicity relation ; however , no mass - metallicity relation is observed among the low - mass globular clusters .",
    "the only possible ways that this could be masked is if @xmath199 ( in marked contrast to the observations , which indicate _ no _ mass - radius relation in this mass regime ) , or if there were a fortuitous cancellation between @xmath32 and @xmath59 of the form @xmath200 , which we consider highly unlikely .",
    "we conclude that the overall picture remains most consistent with metallicities that are dominated by pre - enrichment for most gcs .",
    "several previous models for self enrichment have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "most of these are based on the picture of @xcite , in which the protocluster cloud is a pressure - truncated condensation in the hot halo rather than having its structure determined by gravity @xcite .",
    "such models have predicted no mass - metallicity relation @xcite , or a minimal blue tilt that is much weaker than that observed @xcite , or an inverse mmr in which lower - mass clusters are more metal - rich @xcite .",
    "these are therefore not adequate for understanding the metallicities of the high - mass clusters whose properties are explained by our model .",
    "most of these models also invoke two distinct star formation episodes : an initial burst of ( possibly massive ) primordial composition stars whose ejecta pollute the protocluster region , followed by a subsequent burst of star formation from the enriched material .",
    "we would classify such a model , in which the metals are produced prior to the burst that creates the stellar cluster we see today , as `` pre - enrichment '' ; however , if the delay between the two bursts is sufficiently short ( of order the dynamical time ) , then this is a matter of semantics rather than a physical difference ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the model of @xcite",
    ", they suggest a number of alternatives in order to obtain the right cluster - to - cluster metallicity scatter @xmath201}}}}$ ] , the most notable of which is to adopt arbitrary and large cluster - to - cluster differences in their `` mixing efficiency '' , a parameter resembling our gas retention fraction @xmath59 or the effective yield @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath59 is primarily determined by the initial cluster mass @xmath31 , as we suggest that it should , then we view this approach as unlikely . instead ,",
    "if @xmath201}}}}$ ] is due to pre - enrichment , then it can be understood classically as the result of simple chemical evolution such as a `` leaky box '' model with a suitable effective yield . for the metal - poor gcs or the milky way halo stars ,",
    "a reasonable choice is @xmath202 @xcite .    for our purposes ,",
    "the most relevant previous model is that of @xcite , which was specifically created to explain the observed mmr . their model , like ours , invokes energetic balance between supernova feedback and gravity within a single episode of star formation to produce an mmr via self enrichment .",
    "they also put forward the ideas that the transition mass marks the point at which the metals produced by self - enrichment become comparable to those due to pre - enrichment , and that the lack of a corresponding `` red tilt '' is due to the higher level of pre - enrichment among red sequence gcs .",
    "however , there are several key differences between our models .",
    "first , in their model the star formation efficiency @xmath32 is assumed to vary with mass while the metal retention @xmath59 is constant ; instead , we argue that @xmath59 is the physical quantity much more likely to depend strongly on cluster mass , whereas @xmath203 .",
    "second , @xcite derive power - law scalings for the cluster properties such as mass , metallicity , and radius , but do not address their amplitude at all ; in contrast , our model is on an absolute scale and explicitly predicts the transition mass from the pre - enriched regime to the self - enriched regime .",
    "third , we predict the existence of a more modest mmr at the high - mass end of the _ red _ gc sequence .",
    "finally , and most importantly , they examine the mean trends but not the metallicity scatter between clusters ; not only do we explicitly predict the metallicity scatter due to self enrichment , but we use this prediction to conclude that self - enrichment is unimportant among low - mass gcs .",
    "it may be that a combination of ideas from different models would produce an even more realistic match to the real gc distributions .",
    "for example , our model predicts a relatively rapid transition from the pre - enriched regime at low cluster masses to a strongly self - enriched regime at high masses , which may be more rapid than observed ( note , however , that the mass - radius relation described in   [ massrad section ] results in a shallower mmr ) .",
    "however , a rapid transition from no metal retention to significant metal retention , as in our model , coupled with a star formation efficiency that scales with mass , as in @xcite , might result in a model that is in even better agreement with the observations .",
    "another possible feature to include in a more general model might be the role of external pressure confinement , which could help the lower - mass clouds keep back some of their sn ejecta ( rather than having @xmath204 as would be the case if only self - gravity were operating ) and possibly allowing the mmr to extend to somewhat lower mass .      at present , the different sets of observations indicate that the amplitude ( i.e. the exponent in the scaling @xmath205 ) of the mmr _ may _ differ from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the possibility also exists that the blue - sequence mmr may set in at different mass scales and in some cases may be completely absent @xcite . in the context of our simple enrichment - based model",
    ", these differences would boil down to differences in the degree of self - enrichment at a given cluster mass .",
    "the following factors could vary from galaxy to galaxy and therefore affect the observed cluster metallicities :    1 .",
    "mass loss from a cluster depends on the strength of the tidal field in which it orbits . therefore , gcs subjected to stronger tidal fields should have present - day masses less resembling their original @xmath43 . in this case",
    ", the mmr imparted at birth would be weakened or destroyed when comparing the present - day masses of the clusters to their metallicity .",
    "a possible consequence of this effect would be that the mmr should be stronger in the outer halos of large galaxies .",
    "if the protoclusters were bathed in a particularly strong ultraviolet background during formation , ( e.g. if the galaxy was undergoing a massive starburst during the main epoch of cluster formation ) , the gas may have been less able to cool and therefore the star formation efficiency @xmath32 may have been reduced .",
    "this would result in a lower critical mass @xmath131  and a lower @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath32 were reduced sufficiently , the maximum metallicity achievable by self enrichment could even drop below the pre - enriched value , resulting in no mmr at all ( see also the discussion about the influence of a uv background in * ? ? ?",
    "we have developed a model for stochastic self enrichment in globular clusters .",
    "this model predicts both the mean metallicity and the cluster - to - cluster spread in metallicities that is expected due to stochastic sampling of the imf .",
    "the predicted metallicity scatter is an order of magnitude smaller than observed for galactic gcs ; _ this rules out self enrichment as an important contributor to their global metal content _ and leaves pre - enrichment as the dominant contributor .",
    "this conclusion does not depend strongly on the adopted value of any free parameter and is robust to reasonable changes to the shape of the imf , the supernova heavy element yields , and the details of how metals are retained .",
    "although significant cluster - to - cluster scatter in the star formation efficiency and/or the fraction of metals retained at a given cluster mass could increase the predicted scatter to the observed level , they would most likely be accompanied by a significant mass - metallicity relation at relatively low mass , which is not observed for the milky way .",
    "we have used simple energetics to predict how the metal retention efficiency , a key parameter in the self - enrichment model , increases with cluster mass .",
    "we propose a combined pre - enrichment plus self - enrichment model , where clusters are pre - enriched to the observed level with significant scatter due to their environment , and then those clusters sufficiently massive that they can retain a significant amount of their supernova ejecta are further self - enriched ; the threshold for measurable self - enrichment is predicted to be typically a few @xmath0 .",
    "this model matches the main features of the data so far .      1 .   for globular cluster masses less than @xmath206 , no mmr",
    "is expected for either the blue or red clusters ; the mean cluster metallicities should not depend on mass .",
    "2 .   along the blue gc sequence",
    ", the mmr should ` kick in ' noticeably for @xmath43  higher than a few million @xmath52 , reaching @xmath69}}}}\\simeq -1 $ ] at @xmath207 , corresponding to the most massive known gcs .",
    "the cluster - to - cluster metallicity spread @xmath208}}}}$ ] remains uniform in the low - mass , pre - enrichment regime , but decreases at higher mass in the mmr regime where self - enrichment becomes most important .",
    "4 .   a more modest mmr should exist for the red gc sequence , beginning at a few million @xmath52 . in at least one cd galaxy with a very rich gc system ( ngc  3311 ) ,",
    "this effect at the top of the red sequence may have already been seen .",
    "5 .   within the context of our model ,",
    "the main free parameter controlling the level and amplitude of the mmr is the star formation efficiency @xmath32 .",
    "lowering @xmath32 from our baseline value of @xmath209 would reduce the slope of the mmr along both the red and blue gc sequences and might explain the observed differences between galaxies .",
    "two other physical effects not included in our basic model are a possible correlation of star formation efficiency with cluster mass , and pressure confinement from the gas outside the protoclusters at time of formation . including these effects",
    "properly would allow for a greater range of mmr slopes and onset points and would be an obvious route to explore in a next stage of studying this intriguing effect .",
