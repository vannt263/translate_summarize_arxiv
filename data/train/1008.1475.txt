    "the primary goal of colliding heavy nuclei at relativistic energies is to study the behaviour of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high energy density .",
    "relentless theoretical efforts over more than two decades have given rise to a description where the two lorentz contracted nuclei pass through each other and multiple parton - parton scatterings and a vehement production of partons take place .",
    "this may lead to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons in local thermal equilibrium , called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the unique importance of these studies lies in the well accepted premise that the early universe was in the form of qgp at around a few microseconds after the big bang .",
    "recent experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory have provided a clear proof of the formation of qgp  @xcite or rather a strongly interacting qgp ( sqgp ) , which behaves almost like an ideal fluid  @xcite .",
    "notable confirmations include observations of jet quenching  @xcite , elliptic flow  @xcite , recombination of partons as a process of hadronization  @xcite , and electromagnetic radiations  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical descriptions include parton - cascade model , which represents the multiple collisions and multiplication of the cascading partons using a transport theory  @xcite .",
    "this has been supplemented with a hadronic cascade  @xcite , once the density of partons is sufficiently small .",
    "the initial state has also been modelled as a colour gluon condensate  @xcite .",
    "if a quark gluon plasma is formed in such collisions at some initial time , then assuming a continued thermal and chemical equilibrium , the entire evolution of the system can be calculated using relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the condition of chemical equilibrium has been relaxed in several studies , with interesting results  @xcite .",
    "the consequence of viscosity , in the qgp or in the hadronic phase , is also a subject of considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "our goal in the present study is rather modest but well defined .",
    "we consider that relativistic collision of heavy nuclei ( at rhic and lhc energies ) leads to formation of quark gluon plasma at time @xmath6 .",
    "the plasma then expands , cools , and hadronizes either in a rapid cross - over as suggested by lattice qcd calculations or in a first order phase transition at @xmath7 , used in a large number of calculations over the last two decades using a bag model equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we model the hadronic phase as consisting of all mesons having @xmath8 gev and all baryons having @xmath0 gev along with or without hagedorn resonances .",
    "we find that the inclusion of hagedorn resonances and the finite volume for the hadrons leads to thermodynamic quantities which join rather smoothly to those from a lattice equation of state ( p4 action ; @xmath9 )  @xcite for zero baryonic chemical potential .",
    "we get two different equations of state by switching over from this hadronic state to either the lattice equation of state ( hhl ) or to a bag model equation of state ( hhb ) at @xmath10 165 mev .",
    "the bag model eos admits a mixed phase at @xmath10 165 mev .",
    "the lattice equation of state , on the other hand , displays a sharp cross - over for @xmath11 mev .",
    "we calculate thermal particle production , thermal photon production and the history of evolution of the system using the two equations of state hhl and hhb for central collision of gold ( lead ) nuclei at the highest rhic ( lhc ) energy .",
    "the particle and photon spectra are seen to be only marginally dependent on the eos .",
    "the history of evolution shows noticeable differences for temperature and radial velocity as one might expect . recalling that the intensity interferometry of thermal photons is sensitive to the history of evolution of the system",
    ", we look at the outward , side - ward , and longitudinal intensity correlation of thermal photons having @xmath12 2 gev .",
    "again we find only a marginal difference in side - ward and longitudinal correlations .",
    "the outward correlation of thermal photons is seen to clearly distinguish between the two equations of state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the construction of the two equations of state hhl and hhb . in section iii ,",
    "the initial conditions and the results for the particle and thermal photon spectra at rhic and lhc energies are given . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the history of evolution of the system for the two equations of state ; as well as the source - function for the production of photons . in section",
    "v , we give our results for intensity interferometry of thermal photons .",
    "finally we summarize our findings in section vi .",
    "the resonance gas model relies upon the equivalence of thermodynamic properties of an interacting gas of hadrons and a free gas of hadrons and their resonances  @xcite .",
    "we consider a hadron resonance gas , which consists of all mesons with mass @xmath13 gev , and all baryons with mass @xmath14 gev and their antiparticles .",
    "we include hagedorn states  @xcite having @xmath15 2 gev .",
    "thus mass spectrum can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 in the above , the sum runs over all the discrete hadronic states and their corresponding degeneracies are given by @xmath18 .",
    "all the results discussed in this work assume zero baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath19 0 ) , which is quite reasonable for top rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we take the density of hagedorn states from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath20 where , @xmath21 0.5 gev@xmath22 , @xmath23 gev , @xmath24 0.196 gev , and @xmath25 varies from @xmath26 2 gev to @xmath27 12 gev .",
    "it is noted that the inclusion of the hagedorn resonances is responsible for the rapid chemical equilibration of hadrons produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "this may also signal existence of actual hadronic states ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which have not yet been clearly identified .",
    "only mesonic hagedorn states are considered ( as in the above studies ) and various thermodynamic quantities like - pressure , energy density , number density , and entropy density of the hadronic gas are calculated using standard methods of statistical mechanics .",
    "several procedures  @xcite have been used in the literature to account for the finite volume occupied by the hadrons . the treatment advocated by kapusta and olive  @xcite",
    "is believed to be thermodynamically consistent and has been used for this study .",
    "we shall see that this correction plays an important role in getting results in conformity with those from lattice calculations . according to this treatment , the finite or excluded volume ( xv )",
    "corrected pressure , temperature , energy density , and entropy density are related to those for the point - particle ( pt ) values as : @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the temperature for the system having point particles and @xmath33 ( taken as @xmath34 340 mev from ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the bag constant in the mit bag model description of hadrons .",
    "we discuss our results for the hadronic matter with successively increasing richness of the description ; viz . , hadron gas , volume corrected hadron gas , hadron  +  hagedorn gas , and volume corrected hadron  +  hagedorn gas .",
    "the action for the lattice calculations is given by : @xmath35 the parametrized form of @xmath36 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , where simulation results are given upto a temperature of 539 mev .",
    "it is arbitrarily extended to larger values of temperature in our calculations for lhc energy .",
    "thus , the pressure is obtained by integrating @xmath37 over the temperature , @xmath38    it is found that the pressures for all the four descriptions of the hadronic matter discussed earlier , are nearly identical at a temperature of about 140 mev .",
    "thus , for lattice results the final values for the pressure are obtained by taking @xmath39 as 140 mev , and adding the corresponding pressure from the hadronic matter calculations .    in fig.[fig1 ] ( a  f ) our results for the energy density , pressure , and entropy density are shown .",
    "we see that the energy density , pressure , and the entropy density for the hadronic gas ( point particles ) rise rapidly as the temperature increases beyond 160 mev , as the number density of the particles becomes large .",
    "switching on the volume corrections , arrests this rapid rise , and gives results which approach the values obtained from lattice calculations .",
    "inclusion of hagedorn resonances gives results which are similar in shape to those from lattice calculations over several tens of mev .",
    "best agreement with the lattice calculations are obtained when the hadron  +  hagedorn gas is corrected for the finite volume of the particles .",
    "now we see a very close agreement of all the thermodynamic quantities for the hadronic matter with those obtained using the lattice calculations .    in view of the above , in the following we shall describe the hadronic matter as volume corrected hadron  +  hagedorn gas .    ,",

[ fig2 ] .",
    "once again we see that the hadron  +  hagedorn gas with volume correction gives a speed of sound which is close to that for the lattice calculations over a large window of temperature .",
    "now we construct two equations of state , hhl and hhb . for both",
    ", we use the volume corrected hadron  +  hagedorn gas for @xmath42 165 mev .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the particle ratios using thermal models at rhic suggest a chemical freeze - out temperature which is close to 165 mev at the top rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "similar results are expected for the top lhc energy also  @xcite .    for the hhl equation of state ,",
    "we switch over to the lattice equation of state at @xmath10 165 mev .",
    "we have found that while the variation of energy density , pressure , and entropy density is rather continuous around the point of switch over  fig.[fig1 ] , a slight discontinuity ( of about 3% ) is seen in the speed of sound .",
    "we do not expect it to cause any noticeable difficulty in the final results .    for the hhb , we match our hadronic description to a bag model equation of state , by adjusting the bag pressure to give the transition temperature as 165 mev .",
    "the matter at @xmath43 , then consists of non - interacting and mass - less quarks ( u , d , and s ) and gluons , at zero baryonic chemical potential .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have shown the square of the speed of sound for the two equations of state as a function of @xmath44 , which clearly depicts the vanishing speed of sound for the hhb equation of state , over the energy density covered by the mixed phase .    we reiterate that during the mixed phase , @xmath45 gev/@xmath46 , the speed of sound is zero for the hhb and is larger than that for the hhl equation of state for higher energy densities .",
    "the speed of sound for the hhl is never zero .",
    "these differences in the speed of sound should lead to interesting differences in the history of evolution of the system , though the integrated effects may still turn out to be small .",
    "for 200a gev au+au collision at rhic we assume qgp is formed at @xmath47 0.2 fm/@xmath48 with an energy density used in earlier works  @xcite which provides a good description to particle spectra and thermal photon spectra obtained experimentally .",
    "this is obtained by assuming that a part of the entropy is generated in hard collisions and the remaining part is produced in soft collisions  @xcite and the relative magnitudes are then adjusted to give the rapidity density of the particles produced in the collisions @xmath49 680 . at lhc ( pb+pb @5.5a tev ) , a smaller value of @xmath47 0.1 fm/@xmath48 is considered and the corresponding rapidity density @xmath50 2040  @xcite . for both rhic and lhc , small value of @xmath6 is considered as we are also interested in thermal photon spectra , which derive a large contribution from early times .",
    "if higher formation times are assumed , then the entropy density ( and the energy density ) can be correspondingly reduced .",
    "the average initial energy densities are :    @xmath51    we numerically solve the hydrodynamics equations  @xcite for central collisions for a azimuthally symmetric , and longitudinally boost - invariant expansion of the system for identical initial conditions and the two equations of state .",
    "the freeze - out is assume to take place at @xmath10 100 mev , and the particle spectra are obtained using the cooper - frye formula  @xcite .",
    "the photon production is calculated over the history of evolution of the system  @xcite .",

    "is obtained using a procedure developed earlier  @xcite .",

    "one can easily show that  @xcite a fraction @xmath54 of the energy density ( @xmath55 ) in the mixed phase will be contributed by the quark - gluon plasma , where @xmath56 the remaining fraction @xmath57 will be contributed by the hadronic matter , as seen above .    for the equation of state incorporating lattice results , we assume that the matter consists of quarks and gluons for @xmath58 185 mev and below that it is hadronic .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the results for transverse momentum distribution of thermal photons , pions , kaons , and protons for central collision of gold nuclei at @xmath59 , for the two equations of state , at rhic energy are shown .",
    "the experimental data for 05% most central collisions for the pions , kaons , and protons ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) are also shown for comparison .",
    "no attempts were made to adjust any parameters or normalizations .",
    "several interesting facts emerge .",
    "first of all we note that both the equations of state give a reasonable description to the particle distributions , though a slight preference for the hhl equation of state is easily discernible .",
    "secondly , the inverse slope of the spectra for hhl equation of state is larger than the same for the hhb equation of state , and the largest difference is seen for the spectra for protons .",
    "we feel that the main source of the difference lies in the variation of speed of sound with energy density for the two equations of state .",
    "when the system follows hhb equation of state , the acceleration of the expansion is stalled during the mixed phase , which gives rise to a smaller radial velocity at the time of freeze - out .",
    "we add that the contribution of resonance decay ( which would improve the description of the experimental data at lower @xmath60 ) is not included in this analysis .",
    "similar results have been reported by authors using bag - model and lattice equation of state  @xcite at rhic energies .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also report only a slight difference even for the elliptic flow of pions , though for protons the difference is still noticeable . their description of the hadronic matter , however , is not as rich as that used in the present work .",
    "we have verified that the thermal photon spectrum is quite close to similar calculations reported earlier  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown the data for single photons for 020% most central collisions  @xcite for a comparison .",
    "a complete description of photon data would involve addition of prompt contribution scaled by appropriate nuclear overlapping function  @xcite .",
    "corresponding results for the top lhc energy are shown in fig .",
    "one can see that the difference between the transverse momentum distribution of photons and the hadrons for the two equations of state is further reduced , though the slight increase in the inverse slope for the hhl equation of state can still be seen .",
    "this suggests that the life - time of the system is large enough to greatly obliterate the differences in the momentum distribution of the particles at the time of freeze - out .",
    "in fact , for both the cases the difference in the history of evolution which should have affected the thermal photon spectra is also obliterated due to the integration .",
    "these results suggest that the particle spectra ( even for thermal photons ) can not distinguish between the equations of state , one admitting a first order phase transition , and the other admitting a rapid cross - over as suggested by lattice calculations .",
    "are we to understand that there is no way to distinguish between these two scenarios ?",
    "we realise however that the history of evolution of the two systems must be different , as they are subjected to different rates of expansion due to the varying speed of sound .",
    "we recall some early works  @xcite where it was suggested that a big difference between the so - called @xmath61 and @xmath62 may imply a first order phase transition . the experimental data at rhic energies , however point to an @xmath63 1 , which leads to the so - called hbt puzzle  @xcite at rhic .",
    "it has also spawned several complex questions like what does interferometry of pions actually measure .",
    "a definite , though not sufficient , improvement has been reported when a lattice inspired equation of state is used  @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested  @xcite that several other small corrections add up to fully explain this feature .",
    "we adopt a two - pronged approach in the following .",
    "first , we trace the history of evolution of the systems , both at rhic and lhc , for the two equations of state .",
    "next , we study the intensity interferometry of thermal photons , which should be free from such complications and which should be sensitive to the history of the evolution of the system .",

    "the average is obtained as : @xmath64    we see ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) that both at rhic and lhc , the variation of the energy density with time for the two equations of state is quite similar , though the numerical values show a marginally rapid decrease in @xmath65 at early times for the hhb .",

    "we also find that for hhl equation of state , the quark and hadronic matter contributions become equal ( @xmath122 ) at a slightly lower @xmath123 .",
    "next we consider correlation of thermal photons from central collision of lead nuclei at lhc .",
    "the results for the sideward and the longitudinal correlations for transverse momentum of about 1.2 gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "it is observed that , while the sideward correlation is again nearly identical for the two equations of state , the longitudinal correlation is fairly different and quite sensitive to the equation of state used . in view of the importance of this observation",
    "it would be interesting to analyze this behaviour using a 3 + 1d hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the results for the outward correlation function and its composition in terms of contributions from the quark matter and the hadronic matter are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "once again a very distinctive sensitivity is observed for the two equations of state .",
    "in brief , we have constructed a rich description of hadronic matter at zero baryonic chemical potential by including all the mesons having @xmath124 1.5 gev , and all the baryons having @xmath125 2 gev , in thermal and chemical equilibrium along with hagedorn resonances .",
    "incorporation of finite volume for the hadrons gives results , which join smoothly with those with the recent lattice calculations .",
    "we construct two equations of state by switching over to a bag model equation of state ( leading to a first order phase transition ) or to the lattice equation of state ( showing a rapid crossover around 185 mev ) at a temperature of 165 mev .",
    "we find that spectra of pions , kaons , protons and thermal photons both at rhic and lhc energies are quite similar for a given initial condition .",
    "however , the experimental data at rhic show a slight preference for the equation of state incorporating lattice results .",
    "still , the longitudinal correlation to a lesser extent and the outward correlation to a great extent , for thermal photons are found to be sensitive to the equation of state . if verified in experiments",
    ", this could prove to be a very valuable probe for the equation of state of strongly interacting matter .",
    "we have explained these observations by having a close look at the history of evolution of the systems .    before closing",
    ", we note that these studies could be improved in some ways .",
    "one could , for example , investigate the consequences of inclusion of viscous effects and using a 3 + 1d dimensional hydrodynamics , especially for the longitudinal correlation .",
    "this will also free our findings from the constraint of the longitudinal boost - invariance assumed here .",
    "it would also be of interest to extend this study to non - central collisions , which we shall do shortly .",
    "consequences of varying some of the initial conditions , e.g. , formation time and colour gluon condensate inspired initial conditions could also be studied .",
    "it may also be worth - while to vary the transition temperature for the two equations of state and study its consequences .",
    "future directions would involve extending these studies to non - zero baryonic chemical potential , especially in view of the low energy runs at rhic and upcoming studies at fair , though we await more accurate lattice results for non - zero @xmath126 .    in a forthcoming publication",
    "we shall extend the present work to study the elliptic flow of dileptons as well as the elliptic flow of photons  @xcite .",
    "two of us , sd and rc are grateful to department of atomic energy for financial support during the course of this work .",
    "we thank m. cheng , s. dutta , and s. gupta for useful correspondence .",
