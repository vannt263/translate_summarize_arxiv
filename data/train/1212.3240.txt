    "the recent discovery of high transition temperature ( @xmath10 ) iron - based superconductors ( fe - scs)@xcite has provoked tremendous excitement in condensed matter physics , and launched a new era in the search for the key to high-@xmath10 superconductivity.@xcite like cuprates , fe - scs exhibit a layered structure with electronically active superconducting planes separated by buffer layers , and the superconductivity develops from antiferromagnetic parent compounds upon chemical doping .",

    "<S> we use scanning tunneling microscopy to map the surface structure , nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity , and vitreous vortex phase in the hole - doped superconductor sr@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 with @xmath3=32 k. we find the low-@xmath4 cleaved surface is dominated by a half - sr / k termination with @xmath5 ordering and ubiquitous superconducting gap , while patches of gapless , unreconstructed as termination appear rarely . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting gap varies by @xmath6=16% on a @xmath73 nm length scale , with average @xmath8 in the weak coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex core size provides a measure of the superconducting coherence length @xmath9=2.3 nm . we quantify the vortex lattice correlation length at 9 t in comparison to several iron - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison leads us to suggest the importance of dopant size mismatch as a cause of dopant clustering , electronic inhomogeneity , and strong vortex pinning . </S>"
