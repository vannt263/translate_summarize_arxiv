    "during the last decade , very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray astronomy ( @xmath1  gev ) , which utilizes ground - based imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , has made a substantial contribution to the @xmath0-ray astrophysics of a number of extra - galactic and galactic objects ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the reasons has been the tremendous progress in the observational technique .",
    "one can point out two major trends in this direction .",
    "the first is the use of imaging cameras with very fine pixellation ( a pixel size of about 0.1@xmath2 ) , equipped with fast electronics and an intelligent trigger , for a single stand - alone telescope , accomplished by whipple @xcite , cat @xcite and cangaroo @xcite .",
    "secondly , there has been the development of the stereoscopic observational technique with a number of iacts with imaging cameras of relatively coarse pixellation ( a pixel size of 0.25@xmath2 ) , primarily by the high - energy gamma - ray astronomy ( hegra ) collaboration @xcite .",
    "both trends have finally converged in three future experiments  h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , cangaroo iii @xcite and veritas @xcite , which are the systems of a 10  m class of telescope .",
    "another major project , called magic @xcite , is a single telescope with a very large reflector of 17  m. aspects of stereoscopic observations with three such telescopes have been discussed in @xcite .    for @xmath0-ray point sources ,",
    "the sensitivity of the imaging atmospheric erenkov technique substantially relies on the angular resolution of the instrument .",
    "note that the methods of cosmic - ray rejection based on the analysis of image shape are still not effective enough to reduce entirely the background of hadronic air showers .",
    "thus , in addition , a good angular resolution significantly reduces the background contamination induced by the isotropic cosmic rays .",
    "the observations of @xmath0-ray showers with a single telescope do not allow a complete geometrical reconstruction of the shower axis in space , because only one projection of a shower is available per event .",
    "a full reconstruction becomes possible in observations with two or more telescopes offering simultaneously a number of views of an individual shower .",
    "however , using advanced methods based on the strong correlation between the shape of the erenkov light images and their angular distances to the source position , one can achieve for a single iact an angular resolution for an individual @xmath0-ray shower of about @xmath3 @xcite using a fine pixellation camera .",
    "a substantial improvement of the angular resolution has been achieved by the hegra collaboration using a stereoscopic system of five iacts with rather coarse camera pixellation .",
    "the stereoscopic observations with such a system allow us to reach , with good quality data , an angular resolution for an individual @xmath0-ray as good as 0.06@xmath2 @xcite . the rich hegra data sample of @xmath0-rays from the crab  nebula @xcite , mkn  501 @xcite and mkn  421 @xcite have allowed us to prove in great detail this angular resolution , which is in good agreement with the predictions based on the monte carlo simulations ( for details , see @xcite ) . such an angular resolution has allowed us to perform a systematic search for point - like @xmath0-ray sources at the flux level of @xmath4 .",
    "such high sensitivity was confirmed by the detection of a very faint @xmath0-ray source , the supernova remnant ( snr ) cas  a , which steadily emits @xmath0-rays at the flux level of about @xmath5 above 1  tev @xcite .",
    "the hegra system of five iacts has proved a very effective tool to search for tev @xmath0-ray emission and to study the energy spectra of point - like sources , which are well established in observations at other wavelengths .",
    "however , the potential @xmath0-ray source may appear anywhere within the entire field of view ( fov ) of the instrument , or it may have a rather large angular size as compared to the angular resolution of the instrument , for a certain number of important tasks , such as : ( i ) to search for @xmath0-ray emitters with poorly known position ( such as the egret unidentified sources ) ; ii ) to perform sky surveys ; ( iii ) to study extended @xmath0-ray emission from supernova remnants ; ( iv ) to investigate diffuse emission from the galactic plane ; and finally , ( v ) to detect the primordial @xmath0-ray bursts . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the sensitivity in detecting @xmath0-ray emission with the hegra system of iacts in observations of this type . for this purpose ,",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations of diffuse @xmath0-rays as well as isotropic cosmic rays ( see sections  2 and 3 ) .",
    "the simulations are compared with real data taken with the hegra system of iacts ( section  4 ) .",
    "an important issue is the efficiency of applying the orientational and shape cuts in order to distinguish the @xmath0-rays from the background isotropic cosmic rays .",
    "here we study how this efficiency depends on the angular distance of a @xmath0-ray source to the centre of the fov ( section  5 ) . in section  6",
    ", we discuss the analysis techniques to search for point - like and extended @xmath0-ray sources with the hegra system of iacts , and finally in section  7 we give sensitivity estimates for shell - type supernova remnants .",
    "the simulations have been carried out using a two - step procedure , which has been described in detail in @xcite . in the first step ,",
    "the showers of primary @xmath0-rays and protons were generated in the atmosphere using the altai monte carlo code @xcite .",
    "the showers were randomized over an impact distance with respect to the centre of the telescope array up to a maximum of 250  m. the major parameters of the samples of the simulated showers are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the simulations have been carried out for different zenith angles , covering the range of angles usually used in observations of extended sources with the hegra system of iacts . in the second step , the response of the telescope camera was simulated for all previously generated showers .",
    "this procedure accounts for all efficiencies of the erenkov light detectors ( for details , see @xcite ) . for the protons as well as for the @xmath0-rays , an additional randomization of the images within a solid angle around the telescope axis with a half opening angle of @xmath6",
    "was introduced in order to simulate the isotropic flux of the proton showers and the diffuse @xmath0-rays .",
    "the simulations were carried out for the final hegra set - up of five iacts .",
    "each of the telescopes consists of an 8.5  m@xmath7 reflector focusing the erenkov light on to a camera of 271 photo - multipliers arranged in a hexagonal matrix covering a fov with an effective radius of 2.15@xmath2 .",
    "the telescope camera triggers when the signal in two next - neighbours of the 271 photo - multiplier tubes exceeds a threshold of 8  mv ( @xmath8  photoelectrons ) , and the system readout starts when at least two telescopes are triggered by erenkov light from an atmospheric shower .",
    "the simulation procedure briefly described above was previously used for the production of the simulated data for the hegra system of iacts @xcite .",
    "different parameters of the simulated cosmic - ray - induced as well as @xmath0-ray - induced atmospheric showers have been compared to the data ( see @xcite ) .",
    ".summary of the sample of monte carlo simulated showers . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t1 ]    the calculations show , for example , that a four - pixel coincidence within the observational window composed of 80 pixels is an extremely rare case with a probability less than @xmath9 and the corresponding estimate of confidence at 6@xmath10 level .",
    "but , in practice , one could observe one , two , three or even many more bins with a significant excess in the event rate .",
    "all these cases should be statistically tested taking into account the total number of selected angular bins within the fov , which corresponds to the number of independent trials .    in order to prove the formulae given by equation  ( [ ppp ] ) , we have also made straightforward monte carlo simulations , randomizing the number of entries for @xmath11 pixels according to a gaussian distribution with average value @xmath12 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ t1 ] ( see column @xmath13 mc ) .",
    "one can see a rather good agreement between the direct monte carlo simulations and the values obtained from equation  ( [ ppp ] ) , taking into account a limited statistics in the monte carlo simulations which finally limits the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "an alternative approach to estimate the significance for extended sources would be to make some assumptions about the position and the extension of the @xmath0-ray source , based on physical arguments , taking as on , the correspondent sky region , and as off , several sky regions of the same shape ( if possible ) .",
    "one can calculate the corresponding significance using the approach of li and ma @xcite .",
    "tev @xmath0-ray emission , resulting from the @xmath14-decay produced in nearby supernova remnants ( snr ) by the accelerated protons colliding with the ambient thermal gas nuclei , is marginally high enough to be detectable by currently operating imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "given the angular size of the shell - type snrs , which has been measured in radio wavelength range , the emission region in tev @xmath0-rays is expected to be significantly extended @xcite . in good approximation ,",
    "the source is characterized by the constant brightness in @xmath0-rays all over the snr radio extent .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "the angular size of the snr in radio wavelength is indicated by the dashed circle._,title=\"fig : \" ]    based on the detailed monte carlo simulations for the hegra system we have estimated the sensitivity of the instrument in observations of extended @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the results of the simulations can be interpreted using the established sensitivity for a point - like @xmath0-ray source .",
    "thus , the resulting signal - to - noise ratio for a @xmath0-ray source of an arbitrary angular size , @xmath15 , can be calculated as @xmath16^{1/2 } t^{1/2 } = \\tilde r_\\gamma /[\\tilde r_{cr}]^{1/2 } \\cdot ( \\theta/\\theta_0)^{-1 } t^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the detection rates of @xmath0-rays and cosmic rays , respectively , after applying the analysis cut .",
    "values @xmath19 and @xmath15 correspond to the orientational cuts for a point - like source ( @xmath19= 0.1 ) and extended @xmath0-ray source ( @xmath15 is a source extension ) .",
    "@xmath18 is a cosmic - ray rate for a standard orientational cut applied for a point source search . for the isotropic cosmic - ray background ,",
    "the total number of background counts for an extended @xmath0-ray source is proportional to the angular area covered by this source ( @xmath20 ) . for a 5  @xmath10 detection and fixed observational time ( @xmath21  h )",
    "one can calculate the minimum detectable flux from the point - like @xmath0-ray source . for the hegra array of five iacts",
    "such a minimum detectable flux is @xmath22 .",
    "finally , the minimum detectable flux for an extended @xmath0-ray source is given by @xmath23 where @xmath15 is an angular radius of a source region .",
    "note that for an extended @xmath0-ray source of large extension ( @xmath24  degree ) the integral rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 need to be corrected for the fall - off in the camera response function ( see figure  1 ) . for @xmath0-ray sources of large extension ( @xmath25  degree )",
    "one has to perform observations preferably in on / off mode , i.e.  taking the same amount of off data as for the on data sample , because almost the entire sensitive area is covered by a source region .",
    "the results of the detailed monte carlo simulations may deviate from the estimates given by equation  ( [ ss ] ) for the @xmath0-ray sources of angular extension substantially larger than 1  @xmath2 .    as an example",
    ", we consider here a shell - type snr with an angular size of 0.25@xmath2 ( such as sn  1006 ) .",
    "three different models of tev @xmath0-ray emission have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the profiles of @xmath0-ray brightness are taken from @xcite . the leptonic model of @xmath0-ray emission yields the uniform distribution of emitted @xmath0-rays ( ` circle ' model ) , whereas for hadronic models the brightness might peak around the shock front ( ` ring ' model ) or concentrate around two emission poles ( ` double - pole ' model ) @xcite ( see figure  7 )",
    "we have modelled the response of the hegra system of five iacts for the fluxes and brightness profile given in @xcite after 100  h of observations ( see figure  7 ) assuming the @xmath0-ray flux given in @xcite .",
    "the minimal observing time for a 5  @xmath10 detection depends on the assumed morphology of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "thus , for the ` circle ' , ` ring ' and ` double - pole ' models the minimal detection times are 16  h , 5  h and 2  h , respectively .",
    "deep observation of such an snr could allow us to study in detail the morphology of the tev @xmath0-ray emission and finally to distinguish between different models of @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the response of the hegra system of iacts to the diffuse and extended @xmath0-ray emission over the fov of the instrument was studied by means of detailed monte carlo simulations . within the angular region limited by 1@xmath2 from the centre of the fov the detection rate of the @xmath0-rays as well as the quality factor , characterizing the efficacy of the @xmath0-ray selection ,",
    "are constant .",
    "further extension of the observational window up to 1.5@xmath2 still allows us to have the same sensitivity to the @xmath0-ray fluxes but with noticeably reduced @xmath0-ray detection rate .",
    "an analysis of different trigger multiplicities reveals an improvement in the sensitivity , whereas higher multiplicities lead to the substantial decrease in the @xmath0-ray detection rate .",
    "we have modelled the response of the hegra system of five iacts for observations of nearby snrs . even though the final sensitivity estimate depends on the actual morphology of the tev @xmath0-ray emitting region , in a simple case of a ` circular ' emission region the sensitivity",
    "might be derived by rescaling the sensitivity for a point - like source .",
