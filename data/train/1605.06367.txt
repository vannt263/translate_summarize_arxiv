    "spatially confined elongated strips of graphene monolayer termed graphene nanoribbons ( gnr ) have attracted in recent years substantial interest both theoretically and experimentally ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gnr are of fundamental importance for nanoscience and nanotechnology applications . in general , surpass the gapless 2d graphene monolayers with fixed electronic , optical , and transport properties , and demonstrate flexible features because of an open tunable electronic band gap governed by the ribbon width .",
    "in contrast to zigzag gnr , the armchair gnr ( agnr ) , which possess extrema of the energy bands at the common centre of the brillouin zone are more amenable to a theoretical description .",
    "below we will focus on the semiconductor - like quasi-1d agnr having open band gaps @xmath0 determined by the distances between the electron @xmath1 and hole @xmath2 size - quantized energy levels @xmath3 induced by a finite ribbon width @xmath4 .    optical absorption caused by the transitions between the electron and hole subbands associated with the energy levels @xmath5 represents an effective tool to explore the electronic structure of the agnr electronic structure .",
    "the key point is the inverse square - root divergence of the density of 1d states of free carriers at the band gaps , manifesting itself in the inter - subband optical effects .",
    "however , in the experimental spectra of real agnr these singularities are replaced by a more complicated pattern .",
    "excitons formed by the attractively interesting electron and hole drastically change the optical absorption properties in the vicinity of the edges determined by the energy gaps .",
    "it was shown for exciton absorption in a bulk semiconductor subject to a strong magnetic field @xcite and in a narrow semiconductor quantum wire @xcite that rydberg series of exciton peaks arise below each edge and tend to a finite absorption at edges thereby shadowing the square - root singularity and modifying the fundamental absorption above the edges .",
    "in addition , quasi-1d semiconductor structures are preferable for exciton studies . in units of the exciton",
    "rydberg constant @xmath6 the exciton binding energy @xmath7 in a 3d bulk material is @xmath8 , in a 2d quantum well @xmath9 , while in a 1d quantum wire it is suppressed both by a magnetic field or by the boundaries of the wire @xmath10 ,   ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 is the wire radius or the magnetic length . in this sense",
    "the agnr surpass the semiconductor structures for which the rydberg constant is a fixed parameter , while for the agnr @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "to date , the discrete part of the exciton absorption spectrum of gnr has been calculated numerically @xcite using approaches based on density functional theory , the local density approximation , and the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "_ @xcite and lu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the tight - binding approximation , while alfonsi and meneghetti @xcite employed the hubbard hamiltonian in their _ ab initio _ calculations of the positions and intensities of the exciton peaks .",
    "only a few of the recent approaches @xcite relied on analytical methods based on the nonrelativistic wannier 1d model .",
    "thus , by now the absolute majority of the works focusing on the problem of exciton absorption in narrow agnr are numerical calculations aiming at the exciton binding energy or and discrete exciton peaks . a consistent analytical theory , that considers the 2d two - body exciton hamiltonian and gives rise to quasi-1d bound and unbound excitons , inducing discrete and continuous optical absorption , respectively , is virtually not addressed in the literature .",
    "the inter - subband interaction of the exciton states did not yet attract attention .",
    "in addition , the complete form of the exciton absorption coefficient has not been derived explicitly .",
    "undoubtedly , numerical calculations are required for an adequate description of concrete experiments",
    ". nevertheless , analytical methods are indispensable to make the basic physics of agnr transparent and then to promote the application of these materials in nano- and opto - electronics using the dependence of the properties of the agnr on the ribbon width .    in order to fill the mentioned gaps we develop an analytical approach , which yields an explicit form of the exciton absorption coefficient for agnr .",
    "the electron - hole coulomb attraction is taken to be much weaker than the effect of the ribbon confinement , which in turn means a narrow ribbon as compared to the exciton bohr radius .",
    "the two - body dirac equation describing the 2d massless electron - hole pair is solved in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "this approximation implies that the transverse motion of the particles governed by the ribbon confinement is much faster than its longitudinal motion controlled by the 1d exciton field , which is calculated by averaging the 2d coulomb exciton potential over the electron and hole transverse states . in the single - subband approximation of isolated @xmath14-subbands",
    "the exciton energy spectrum is a sequence of series of the quasi - coulomb strictly discrete @xmath15- levels positioned below the @xmath14th size - quantized level and continuous subbands originating from each @xmath14-level .",
    "a coupling between the discrete and continuous exciton states , specified by the @xmath16 levels is taken into account in the double - subband approximation .",
    "inter - subband interaction converts the strictly discrete @xmath15-states into the quasi - discrete ones ( fano resonances ) , having nonzero energy widths , which manifest itself in the lorentzian form of the exciton absorption peaks .",
    "clearly , energetically lowest exciton series , corresponding to the ground size - quantized level @xmath17 does not interact with the series lying above and remains discrete .",
    "our mathematical approach is based on matching the coulomb wave functions with the functions obtained upon solution of the dirac equation in the intermediate region by the iteration method .",
    "this procedure has been originally developed by hasegawa and howard @xcite for 3d excitons subject to a strong magnetic field and then successfully extended to problems related to semiconductor ( see @xcite and references therein ) and graphene @xcite nanostructures .",
    "the dependence of the exciton absorption coefficient on the ribbon width is studied analytically .",
    "our results are in line with the conclusions based on numerical approaches and the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the aim of this work is to make agnr attractive as optoelectronic devices due to the strong dependence of the exciton spectrum on the ribbon width .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2 the general analytical approach",
    "is described .",
    "the energy levels of the discrete states and the exciton wave functions of the discrete and continuous energy spectrum are calculated in section 3 in the single - subband approximation .",
    "the discrete exciton peaks and the continuous absorption are considered in section 4 .",
    "section 5 provides the double - subband approximation to study the optical series of the fano @xmath18-resonances , relevant to the first excited subband @xmath19 in section 6 we discuss the obtained results , compare them with the available data , and estimate the expected experimental values .",
    "section 7 contains our conclusions .",
    "below we consider the exciton absorption in an agnr with width @xmath4 and length @xmath20 placed on the @xmath21 plane and bounded by straight lines @xmath22 the polarization of the light wave is assumed to be parallel to the @xmath23-axis .",
