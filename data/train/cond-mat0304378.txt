    "since discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991@xcite , a deep physics of these one  dimensional nanoscale objects has been demonstrated .",
    "fundamental properties of the nanotubes have been studied in view of possible applications in electronics and other devices@xcite .",
    "a detailed theoretical description for electronic structure of ideal single  wall nanotubes ( swnts ) was obtained as well as for an effect of various defects and disorder on the swnt electronic properties ( _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , the nanotube systems under experimental study often deviate from a model picture . in this letter",
    "we investigate one aspect of a real system : the modification of the electronic properties of the swnt deposited on a substrate .",
    "one expects that symmetry of the nanotube at the substrate will be lower than the symmetry of the nanotube itself in vacuum .",
    "a description of a breaking of the symmetry of swnt bandstructure due to a charge transfer ( or charge injection ) between the nanotube and the substrate ( or contacts ) and calculation of a polarization of the substrate and the nanotube , which follows to the charge transfer , are the goals of our study .",
    "effects of splitting , mixing , and/or anti  crossing of the nanotube subbands , that are caused by the depolarization of the electron charge density , have been almost neglected in literature before .",
    "we use term  depolarization \" for a number of phenomena including a transverse shift of the electron charge density from its equilibrium distribution profile ( effects due to an axial / longitudinal depolarization were discussed elsewhere@xcite ) .",
    "we will show that the _ transverse depolarization _ results in qualitative changes of the nanotube density of states ( dos ) near van hove singularities .",
    "in particular , we predict the _ splitting _ of a doublet state@xcite to be likely observable as a function of the injected / induced charge density of the swnt .",
    "we will discuss that in sec.[sec : model ] . in sec.[sec",
    ": fermi ] we will calculate this injected / induced charge density in a selfconsistent way .",
    "the depolarization and _ intrasubband _ splitting will be studied for a typical experimental situation : a single swnt lies on a conductive substrate or separated from the conductor by a thin insulating layer representing an oxide on the surface of a metal .",
    "we assume that the nanotube is connected to electron reservoirs , which may be the leads or the conductor substrate itself . a transverse external electric field and/or a work function difference between the swnt and the substrate / contact",
    "induce non ",
    "zero electron / hole charge density in the nanotube .",
    "this extra charge density polarizes the substrate , which breaks the axial symmetry of the nanotube .",
    "this effect is much larger than an electronic structure perturbation caused by the lattice distortion which may happen due to a van der waals attraction to the substrate@xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that a direct action of the _ uniform _ external electric field is of minor importance as compared to the _ nonuniform _ field of surface charges on the substrate .",
    "we will discuss a modification of our theory of the subband splitting for a case of purely insulating substrate in the last section .",
    "to calculate the splitting and shift of the electron energy levels one needs to know matrix elements of the perturbation potential between corresponding wave  functions . in our case ,",
    "the perturbation is a selfconsistent coulomb potential ( operator in heisenberg representation ) which describes the interaction between the probe electron and the extra charge density on the swnt and the polarization charge density on the substrate surface : @xmath0 both the probe electron and the nanotube surface charge are taken on a cylinder of a radius @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "@xmath4 is the surface charge density .",
    "it does not depend on the coordinate @xmath5 along the nanotube because we assume the translational invariance of the problem for clarity of derivation .",
    "although , the theory can be easily extended for the case of slow variation of @xmath4 along the axis .",
    "we will show later that one can drop dependence of @xmath4 on the angle @xmath6 along the circumferential direction in approximation of a _ linear response _ ( in higher orders of perturbation theory a direct transverse polarization must be taken into account@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath7 is an image charge density which is equal to @xmath8 for the metallic substrate .    the first term of eq.([coulomb ] )",
    "is the interaction with the charge density on the nanotube , which coincides with the hartree term for the swnt in vacuum ( without charge injection ) . the second term in eq.([coulomb ] )",
    "has also a simple physical meaning : this is the energy of interaction of the electron with the image charge .",
    "the separation between the swnt axis and the surface of the conductor is @xmath9 . in case of the metallic substrate",
    "it is about the nanotube radius , @xmath1 , plus the van der waals distance for graphite : @xmath10 nm .    the matrix element of the coulomb operator ( [ coulomb ] ) is calculated with the wave  functions of a tight  binding ( tb ) hamiltonian .",
    "we use envelope wave  functions , obtained similarly to ref.@xcite .",
    "this approach has been widely used in the literature , so we skip details and give the wave  functions in the one  band scheme ( @xmath11 electrons only ) in the form : @xmath12 here index @xmath13 labels subbands of the swnt electronic structure , @xmath14 is a longitudinal momentum , these two are good quantum numbers ( discrete and continuum , respectively ) for an ideal , long enough nanotube ; @xmath15 is a pseudospin .",
    "( a pseudospinor vector is formed by a two  component wave  function amplitude defined for two atoms in a graphite unit cell , a and b ) .",
    "coordinate along the tube is @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the angle along the nanotube circumference .",
    "we assume that our potential is smooth at the scale of the single unit cell ( 0.25 nm ) .",
    "then , one may neglect transitions with the pseudospin flip ( transitions between sublattices ) .",
    "with use of the orthogonality relation between the spinor components , it yields : @xmath16 @xmath17 [ me ] where @xmath4 , the surface charge density , has to be defined later in a selfconsistent way .",
    "the eqs.([me1],[me2 ] ) are obtained by a direct fourier transformation of ( [ coulomb ] ) and describe the energy level shift when @xmath18 and the mixing of different subbands at @xmath19 .",
    "the most interesting term with @xmath20 is the mixing between the degenerate electron states within the same subband . by solving a secular equation for the intrasubband mixing of the electron doublet",
    "we obtain the splitting of the van hove singularity at the subband edge ( fig.[fig : split ] ) .",
    "the new subband energy separation reads as : @xmath21 let us now calculate the injected / induced charge density @xmath4 which will allow us a numerical estimation for the @xmath22 splitting .",
    "the eqs.([me1][split ] ) are written for the given charge density @xmath4 which has to be derived in this section . when the swnt is placed in a real device",
    ", one must consider the work function difference between the nanotube and the contact or the conducting substrate and/or the external potential which may be applied to the swnt .",
    "the potential shifts the fermi level in the swnt@xcite . as a result of this the positive / negative charge is injected into the nanotube : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is a bare one  dimensional dos ( independent of @xmath4 in a linear response theory ) ; @xmath25 is the shift of the electrochemical potential of the swnt ( with respect to a charge neutrality level @xmath26 ) which depends on the work function difference , @xmath27 , on the external potential , @xmath28 , applied between the nanotube and the reservoir and on the potential @xmath29 induced by the charge density of the nanotube , @xmath4 .",
    "this last term is proportional to the intrasubband term ( @xmath18 ) of the coulomb interaction given by the eq.([me2 ] ) .",
    "this selfconsistent equation for @xmath4 , ( [ sigma ] ) , is readily solved analytically if the electrochemical potential is below the second subband edge .",
    "we follow ref.@xcite in derivation of @xmath4 : the induced potential is obtained by direct integration of the charge density along the swnt as in @xcite . as it is shown in figure [ fig : dos ] , for a metallic swnt , the charge is a product of the constant dos , @xmath30 , and the electrochemical potential , @xmath31 .",
    "then the solution of eq.([sigma ] ) is as follows : @xmath32 and for a semiconductor swnt , which has the dos @xmath33 , the charge is as follows : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the heaviside unit step function and @xmath36 is @xmath37 of the energy gap .",
    "we introduced a quantum capacitance of the swnt following ref.@xcite : @xmath38 which is the one  dimensional analog of the quantum capacitance proposed for a two  dimensional electron gas system by luryi@xcite . here",
    "@xmath39   is the interatomic distance , @xmath40  ev is the hopping integral for the graphite  like systems .",
    "we notice that despite the @xmath41 , as given by eq.([intofdos2 ] ) , comes from a massive subband ( in contrast to @xmath42 , as in eq.([intofdos1 ] ) where the lowest subband is massless , see in fig.[fig : dos ] ) , the linear dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath28 preserves as long as the potential @xmath28 is large enough .",
    "this reflects the fact that a classical one  dimensional charge density is a linear function of a classical electrostatic potential @xcite .",
    "in the last section we obtained the selfconsistent expression for the surface charge density as a function of the external potential and the work function difference which may be considered as a built  in potential . substituting eq.([intofdos1 ] ) into eq.([split ] ) we obtain the splitting of the degenerate subbands @xmath44 of the metallic swnt ( when the fermi level is within the first subband ) as follows : @xmath45 the splitting decreases with @xmath13 exponentially , hence , the effect is likely observable for the lowest degenerate subband .",
    "then , for the following parameters : the swnt radius @xmath46   , the distance to the metal substrate @xmath47   , and the quantum capacitance @xmath48@xcite , we obtain a numerical estimate for the subband splitting @xmath49 .",
    "experimental data for the work function of swnts scatters from 4.9 to 5.05 ev @xcite . for the swnt on the gold substrate we use as an estimate @xmath50  ev . in absence of the external potential , this work function difference results in @xmath51  mev gap between two split peaks of the density of states ( fig.[fig : split ] ) , which is larger that @xmath52 at room temperature .",
    "we also calculated the contribution of all other subbands , which is negligible in the splitting , but it shifts the doublet as a whole . as a result , two new peaks in the fig.[fig : split ] appear not symmetrical with respect to the original dos singularity .",
    "the splitting of @xmath53 doublet is an analogue of a degenerate level stark effect for the nanotube in a multipole potential of the image charge .",
    "the lower subband has @xmath54 symmetry and the upper subband has @xmath55 symmetry ( with corresponding wave ",
    "functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) because of an attraction energy of the electron to its image charge is lower for the second combination .",
    "we predict a similar effect for the semiconductor nanotube , although , the total external potential causing the charge density injection must be larger than one half of the gap in this case . as we study in this paper only the effect which is linear in the external potential , all high order terms in eq.([intofdos2 ] ) have to be discarded .",
    "the charge injection in the nanotube may be readily achieved by applying external electric field .",
    "one may naively argue that the external field itself can break the bandstructure symmetry and result in some level splitting .",
    "although , it is correct statement in general , the direct splitting of the swnt orbital doublet @xmath53 by the uniform electric field is forbidden by symmetry . these degenerate states do not mix together due to the selection rules of the problem .",
    "the matrix element for an intrasubband splitting in the uniform external field @xmath58 equals zero by parity : @xmath59 .    in order to calculate the subband splitting in this case we have to compute the charge injection , which is proportional to the applied field .",
    "the potential is equal to @xmath60 , where @xmath9 is the distance between the axis of the tube and the metal surface , which has to be substituted into eq.([metsplit ] ) .    in sec.[sec :",
    "model ] we assumed that the charge density @xmath4 has no dependence on the angular coordinate @xmath6 along the nanotube circumference .",
    "this is an accurate approximation since a dipole ( and higher multipole ) component of the @xmath4 is small as compared to what is given by eqs.([intofdos1],[intofdos2 ] ) .",
    "let us prove this assumption for the dipole polarization of the swnt .",
    "the non  uniform external potential causes a deviation of the surface density from the uniform equilibrium value , @xmath4 , which is given by following expression : @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the occupation numbers , the matrix element @xmath63 is given by eqs.([me1],[me2 ] ) , @xmath64 are the energies of subbands and @xmath65 are corresponding wave  functions .",
    "we define the nonuniform dipole part of the charge density of a swnt as @xmath66 .",
    "then , the dipole component of the surface charge is as follows : @xmath67    let us remind that according to eq.([me1 ] ) @xmath68 .    in case of",
    "the electrochemical potential equals zero ( no charge in the nanotube ) , the transverse polarization includes transitions from the valence to conduction band only @xmath69 ( the details of the calculation are presented elsewhere@xcite ) . here , we study an extra component of the polarization , which is due to the induced charge density .",
    "thus , we need to consider only transitions from the levels above the charge neutrality level , @xmath26 , and below the fermi level , @xmath70 , ( which is the shaded area in fig.[fig : dos ] ) .",
    "hence , the dipole polarization is proportional to the net charge density @xmath4 , and the dipole charge density of the armchair swnt is given by the following expression : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the dimensionless quantum capacitance .",
    "we single out term @xmath73 , which is the specific one  dimensional charge density of the swnt and proportional to the external potential and , thus , to the external field .",
    "the eq.([sigma1 ] ) shows that the effect of the transverse polarization on the bandstructure is quadratic in the external field , in good agreement with a plain dielectric response theory@xcite , while the effect of the image charge is linear in @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the degenerate level splitting due to the dipole component of the polarization will be less important than the splitting due to a uniform component : @xmath74 , at least , in a weak field regime discussed in the article .",
    "this proves post factum our assumption of @xmath4 to be independent of @xmath6 .      for the sake of completeness we present here also a modification of our theory to the case of a dielectric substrate . in this case",
    "the screening of the charge density in the nanotube is weaker .",
    "it results from ( i ) underscreening of the coulomb interaction between the nanotube carriers and ( ii ) lower charge density induced in the substrate .",
    "the second factor can be taken into account by substituting an effective image charge density @xmath75 in the second term of eq.([coulomb ] ) , where @xmath76 is the dielectric function of the substrate ( in case of highly conductive substrate it equals @xmath77 ) , instead of the bare image charge density @xmath8 .",
    "this results in substituting @xmath7 in eqs.([me1][intofdos2 ] ) where appropriate .",
    "now , the fields of the image charge and the charge in the swnt do not cancel each other in contrast to the case of the metallic substrate . as a result",
    ", the underscreening of the coulomb interaction happens .",
    "this modifies the equations for the energy level shift ( _ intrasubband _ matrix elements as in eq.([me2 ] ) ) and , thus , the electrochemical potential shift .",
    "one must substitute @xmath78 term everywhere by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the length of the nanotube ( or distance between metal leads to it ) .",
    "this expression diverges with the length of the nanotube which reflects the one  dimensional character of the coulomb interaction .",
    "these changes have to be made through eqs.([intofdos1][metsplit ] )",
    ".    the first term of eq.([coulomb ] ) does not appear in the calculation of the _ intersubband _ matrix elements as in eqs.([me1],[split ] ) .",
    "hence , no additional correction is required in the equations ( [ angular][dipole ] ) of the last section .",
    "we assumed in this paper that the perturbation theory in a linear approximation in @xmath31 ( or equivalently in @xmath4 ) is applicable .",
    "restrictions which may follow from this assumption are as follows .",
    "the external potential has to be small .",
    "we neglect here the dipole term in the induced charge density ( and higher multipoles as well ) .",
    "it is equivalent to a weak intersubband mixing which assumption may not hold for wide nanotubes or strong external fields .",
    "the effect of the strong field on the bandstructure is discussed elsewhere@xcite . in this paper",
    "we used the eq.([sigma ] ) for the equilibrium charge density in the swnt .",
    "one may consider transport devices on equal basis , as long as the charge of the nanotube is still given by the quasi ",
    "equilibrium charge density .",
    "however , for non  zero current flowing through the nanotube , one must use an expression for the charge density which differs from eq.([sigma ] ) ( to be discussed elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "in summary , we have developed a microscopic quantum mechanical theory for a charge transfer between a swnt and a conductive substrate ( and/or metallic leads ) .",
    "this charge injection results from a natural work function difference between the nanotube and the substrate or / and from an external potential applied between those .",
    "a surface charge density of the swnt is calculated selfconsistently within an envelope function formalism of tight  binding approximation .",
    "we demonstrated for the first time that the influence of this charge transfer on the electronic structure of the swnt is not negligible for typical material parameters of the problem . because of the breaking of the axial symmetry of the system , the swnt dos changes qualitatively : degenerate subbands @xmath53 , where @xmath81 , split .",
    "it has a simple physical interpretation  the electrons with @xmath54 and @xmath55 polarizations are no longer equivalent as their attraction to the substrate is different .",
    "this effect can be related to a degenerate level stark effect with an appropriate choice of external field of the image charge .",
    "the gap between the new @xmath54 and @xmath55 subbands is constant in @xmath14space ( for the external field which is uniform along the tube ) so it shows up dramatically at the subband edge .",
    "the van hove singularity splits , and the distance between two peaks of the dos is about 46 mev for the [ 10,10 ] armchair swnt on the gold substrate .",
    "we obtained analytical expressions for matrix elements of the image charge field , which yields the mixing of different subbands and can be used to describe the level anticrossing ( to be discussed elsewhere ) .",
    "same matrix elements enter the expression for the multipole polarizabilites of the swnt .",
    "we estimated a major contribution to the dipole polarizability of the armchair swnt , which comes from intraband transitions for non  zero charge injection .",
    "the analytical expression for the dipole component of the surface charge density is shown to be proportional to the square of the external potential and , hence , appears in the second order of the perturbation theory which corroborates post factum our assumption of uniformity of the induced / injected charge along the swnt equator .",
    "we show that the modification of our theory to the case of semiconductor substrate is straightforward .",
    "the analytical expressions for the van hove singularity splitting and induced charge density are obtained .",
