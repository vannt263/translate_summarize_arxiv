    "the general situation is different for the projection @xmath205 . in this case , the orientifold projection preserves each twist sector separately , @xmath206 , and the explicit computation of the closed string spectra@xcite shows that if the orbifold fixed point at which the cycle @xmath207 is located is also invariant under @xmath2 , one hypermultiplet per twist sector emerges , while orbifold fixed points which form pairs under @xmath2 support a hyper and a tensor multiplet .",

    "the orbifold invariant bulk and exceptional cycles are computed along the same lines as for the @xmath42 case described in section  [ subsec : geometry ] , and the fractional cycles are computed in the spirit of  ( [ eq : fraccycles ] ) .      the @xmath222 model with fractional d6-branes at angles is the first known case with three quark generations and no additional chiral matter charged under the qcd - stack . in this construction ,",
    "the replication of generations occurs via an intriguing interplay between discrete wilson lines and the @xmath223 symmetry on the additional 2-torus , see figure  2 .",
    "the observation that three families arise naturally from @xmath223 singularities is known from heterotic compactifications for nearly @xcite . however , the discrete wilson lines in the model with d6-branes at angles belong to the @xmath52 singularities of the orbifold symmetry @xmath224",
    ".    the details of the construction can be found in@xcite .",
    "the chiral content of the supersymmetric standard model can be obtained from five stacks of d6-branes in a great variety of geometric settings .",
    "the chiral spectrum is insensitive to the specific realization and listed in table  8 .",
    "the initial gauge group of the construction is @xmath225 , and after the generalized green schwarz mechanism , the anomaly - free group is @xmath226 the hypercharge is a linear combination of the massless abelian groups ,    the masses of the anomalous @xmath29 factors and the non - chiral spectrum depend on the geometric details of the construction . in some cases",
    ", it is possible to recombine the stacks @xmath33 and @xmath227 such that the remaining two kinds of chiral multiplets obtain the quantum numbers of the higgs particles . in this case , the higgs sector is three times the one of the minimal supersymmetric standard model as expected from the ` anomaly ' constraint on the @xmath228 gauge factor .",
    "the construction of left - right symmetric extensions of the standard model on @xmath229 follows the same lines , and again the higgs sector is three times the minimal one .",
    "the phenomenology of this class of models is currently under investigation.@xcite",
    "it is a pleasure to thank t.  ott for the collaboration on the @xmath229 models.@xcite + this work is supported by the rtn european program under contract number hprn - ct-2000 - 00148 .",
