    "contamination of silicon oxides by impurities has represented a long - term problem for metal - oxide - semiconductors ( mos ) production as this deeply affects the electrical behaviour and degrades the performance of transistors .",
    "impurities are easily incorporated into silicon or the oxide throughout the fabrication of devices .",
    "the first source of contamination occurs during the growth of materials where the temperature facilitates the incorporation of impurities such as sodium , antimony , gallium and phosphorous into oxides and heavy metal like copper , lithium , gold into silicon",
    ". however , contamination also happens on processed devices that are left unprotected even in a cleanroom environment @xcite .",
    "the silicon oxide is effectively vulnerable to various fast diffusers at room temperature like h@xmath0 , oh@xmath1 and more specifically na@xmath0 ions .",
    "the study of the electronic properties of silicon transistors with oxides containing such types of ions is consequently of great interest from the perspective of optimising the quality of electronic components .",
    "early studies started in the 70 s when fowler and hartstein used a silicon mos field effect transistor ( mosfet ) to probe the impurity states located below the conduction band in a sodium - contaminated device @xcite .",
    "they found the presence of the ions near the si - sio@xmath2 interface at a concentration of few @xmath3ions.@xmath4 was responsible for the formation of an impurity band . at lower impurity concentrations , the situation is more complex as the impurity band splits into a ground and several excited bands @xcite .",
    "the formation of two separate bands in sodium - doped mosfets was experimentally observed in a previous study for temperatures below 20k and confirmed by the analysis of the density of states at different gate voltages ( figure 1 ) @xcite . in the case of sodium , the ground state band",
    "is predicted to be formed by a single bound electron while the first excited band is formed a pair of bound electrons ( respectively lower and upper hubbard band ) .",
    "the possibility that two electrons may occupy the same site has been suggested by fowler et al @xcite but has remained an open question .",
    "this eventuality is of importance to quantum measurement based on charge quantum bits ( qubits ) @xcite . in order to investigate that possiblity",
    ", it is necessary to understand the electronic properties of low - doped mos . to this end , we performed complemetary measurements which looked into details of the temperature dependence of the source - drain conductivity in the regime where electrons are activated from the impurity band to the conduction band edge , i.e above 20k .",
    "we show that results are also consistent with an activation from the lower to the upper band as this has already been observed @xcite .",
    "arguments are given in favor of the presence of hubbard bands .",
    "we have fabricated mosfets in a circular geometry ( corbino ) from a ( 100 ) p - silicon wafer with high resistivity ( 10@xmath5@xmath6.cm ) .",
    "such transistors has been widely used because of the ability to continuously vary the electron density and the fermi energy by use of a metal gate .",
    "its geometry eliminates leakage current paths around the contacts as well as minimizes scattering with boron acceptor impurities , especially close to the interface .",
    "the effective channel length and the interior diameter of the corbino mosfets were measured to be respectively 1 and 110@xmath7 m .",
    "a 35nm - gate oxide was grown at 950@xmath8c in a dry , chlorine - free oxygen atmosphere .",
    "contacts were realized by implanting phosphorous at high dose and sputtering aluminium .",
    "the contact resistivity was measured to be 3.5 and 2.3@xmath6.@xmath9 respectively at nitrogen and helium temperatures and the sheet resistance was 6.3 and 5.9@xmath6.@xmath10 @xmath11 for the same temperatures .",
    "sodium ions were introduced onto the oxide surface by immersing the device in a @xmath12n solution of high purity sodium chloride in deionized water .",
    "the surface of the chip was then dried with nitrogen gas and an aluminium gate subsequently evaporated .",
    "the application of a positive gate voltage ( + 4v at @xmath13c for 10mins ) causes the sodium ions to drift towards the si - sio@xmath2 interface without diffusing into silicon @xcite .",
    "the application of @xmath14v dc in the same conditions removes the ions from the interface .",
    "the ions are frozen at their position once the device temperature becomes lower than 150k ( figure1 ) .",
    "standard low - noise lock - in techniques with an amplifier of 10@xmath15v / a were used to measure the source to drain conductivity .",
    "an ac excitation of 15@xmath7v and a frequency of 11hz were chosen .",
    "the dc offset of the amplifier was cut using appropriate rc filters .",
    "finally , the gate voltage was controlled by a high resolution digital to analog converter and the temperature measured by a calibrated germanium thermometer .",
    "several devices were processed identically and gave results that lead to identical conclusions although we noticed some variations in the relative positions and in the widths of impurity bands as well as in the conductivity values .",
    "we also fabricated a number of control devices that were not exposed to sodium contamination and were used for comparison .",
    "the subthreshold to saturation current ratio was about @xmath16 at 300k and @xmath17 at 0.3k . in the case of doped devices",
    "this ratio falls down to 10 at 300k and @xmath16 at 0.3k .",
    "the presence of charges close to the si - sio@xmath2 interface is responsible for the finite conductivity in the accumulation region of the mosfet .",
    "the following results are presented for a specific device that was chosen for its high reproducibility in time as well as for its high signal to noise ratio .",
    "we have measured the source - drain conductivity @xmath18 for gate voltages @xmath19 between -2.5 and 0.4v and for temperatures ranging from @xmath20 to 100k .",
    "the variation of conductivity with temperature was reproducible up to 110k .",
    "we have previously shown that correlated hopping is present below 20k in our device @xcite . in this paper , we focus our analysis on the upper part of the temperature range where hopping is expected to disappear and be replaced by activated behaviour . however , we attempted to fit the curves using a general hopping model in which the exponential prefactor was temperature dependent and the density of state at the fermi level was energy dependent .",
    "extensive statistical analysis showed hopping does not occur above 20k but that the conductivity follows an activated behaviour as described by the expression @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functions of @xmath19 and @xmath24 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "the exponential prefactor was taken to be temperature dependent in order to reflect the temperature dependence of the mobility of electrons @xcite .",
    "its dependence in temperature as well as the value for @xmath22 reflects the complex scattering mechanisms occuring at the si - sio@xmath2 interface .",
    "best fits were obtained for @xmath25 for which the arrhenius plot of @xmath26 gave straight lines , indicating an activation mechanism for the electrons .",
    "small - polarons also give rise to such a prefactor in the mobility in the adiabatic regime , where electrons hop without introducing further deformation @xcite .",
    "however , the highest temperature used in the present study is 100k which is well below the energy of longitudinal optical phonons in silicon .",
    "the presence of such polarons is thus unlikely .",
    "however , this value for @xmath24 is widely found in systems where the hopping transport is through a random potential or for gaussian density of states @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with early studies on the same device proving the existence of impurities bands @xcite .",
    "such an activated behaviour for the conductivity has already been observed in mosfets devices @xcite . in our case , the situation is complex and depends on the range of gate voltage studied . for @xmath27v@xmath28@xmath29@xmath280.2v ,",
    "there exists two activation mechanisms , one at lower temperature characterized by an activation energy @xmath30 and a second one at higher temperature with an energy @xmath31 .",
    "however , a single activation process with an energy @xmath32 is found for @xmath33v@xmath28@xmath29@xmath28@xmath27v . for comparison ,",
    "two impurity bands were found respectively for @xmath33v@xmath28@xmath29@xmath28 - 1.7v ( lower band ) and for @xmath34v@xmath28@xmath29@xmath280.2v ( upper band ) ( inset in figure 2 ) .",
    "our control devices containing no sodium showed no activated transport at any gate voltage .",
    "below @xmath29=-0.3v the conductivity of these devices remained close to zero for the range of temperatures we investigated . above @xmath29=-0.3v and for temperatures up to 50 or 70k depending on the gate voltage , only correlated hopping as described by efros and shklovskii @xcite was present ( figure 3 ) and in agreement with mason and kravchenko experiments @xcite .",
    "effectively experiments were carried out in the insulating side of the metal - to - insulator transition where electron - electron interaction may be important in the absence of disorder induced by impurities at the interface .",
    "moreover the size of the coulomb gap was sufficiently wide not be screened by the temperature .",
    "this suggests the presence of activation energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 are related to the presence of impurity traps at the si - sio@xmath2 interface .",
    "the presence of two distinct activation energies @xmath30 and @xmath31 suggest two different activation mechanisms . unlike fritzsche s observations @xcite these mechanisms can not be simultaneous because of the negative curvature of the conductivity in figure 2 at high temperature .",
    "consequently , the source - drain conductivity is not written as a sum of parallel processes in this region .",
    "therefore , this suggests that the mechanism responsible for @xmath30 may disappear at a given temperature for the benefit of the mechanism @xmath31 .",
    "figure 4 shows the variation of the activation energy at different voltages .",
    "we observe that @xmath30 has an exponential variation with @xmath19 . in mosfets , for weak accumulation ,",
    "the surface potential energy is exponentially dependent in gate voltage .",
    "the variation of @xmath35 then simply reflects the change in the intrinsic fermi energy and the gate capacitance when the gate voltage is varied .",
    "we can then assume that @xmath30 corresponds to an activation of electrons from the upper band to the conduction band edge @xcite .",
    "the absence of the activation @xmath30 for @xmath36 may be interpreted as the existence of a conduction band threshold in the upper band separating the localized states in the band tail from a region of conducting states at the centre of the band .",
    "the upper band edge is therefore 36mev below the conduction band edge .",
    "close to the threshold voltage , the variation of the activation energy with gate voltage is linear , in the first approximation . by capacitance arguments , it is possible to express the value of @xmath30 in terms of the distance @xmath37 of the sodium ions from the interface :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the threshold voltage .",
    "we find that the threshold voltage for conduction in the conduction band is @xmath400.2v and that the shallowest localized states of the upper band reside at @xmath41=8.5mev below the conduction band edge .",
    "the thickness of our oxide being @xmath42 of 35 nm , the ions may then lie as close as 0.7 nm from the si - sio@xmath2 interface .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the earlier results from di maria @xcite who obtained @xmath43 nm by measuring the oxide photocurrent at nitrogen temperature .",
    "we can also estimate the width of the upper impurity band tail from the energy range for which the activation process is present , giving a width close to 27mev .",
    "concerning @xmath31 , the information obtained from the plot of the activation energy versus gate voltage is not sufficient to determine the nature of the corresponding mechanism and the variation of the pre - exponential factor with @xmath19 ( figure 5 ) needs to be analysed .",
    "the plot of @xmath44 ( figure 5 ) is consistent with the meyer - neldel rule ( mnr ) @xcite that gives an activation law for the prefactor .",
    "this behaviour is found across all ranges of activation energy with a slope corresponding to a typical energy @xmath45 of 10.5mev whereas the relation is highly non - monotonic for @xmath46 .",
    "the observation of the mnr is commonly reported in single crystal , polycrystalline , amorphous , organic semiconductors as well as ionic crystals and glasses but more generally in inhomogeneous semiconductors @xcite .",
    "interpretations on the origin of the mnr are various but the difference in the behaviour of @xmath47 and @xmath48 makes our experimental results incompatible with a variation of the fermi energy in temperature @xcite .",
    "multiphonon hopping has also been proposed @xcite but this would imply the absence of the mnr for @xmath49 which is not the case . in an ionic crystal ,",
    "the mnr is explained by a restructuring of the lattice formed by the ions @xcite and an activated conductivity due to an activation of the carrier density or of the mobility @xcite . in our case , an analogy",
    "could be made except that sodium ions are unlikely to move below 100k .",
    "we have verified this by performing thermal cycles from 0.3k to 100k that modify neither the height or the position of the conductivity peaks in figure 2 .",
    "the mechanism responsible for @xmath31 may be interpreted in the following way . below a certain temperature @xmath50 , sodium ions form a disordered lattice and some electrons",
    "are localized by the impurity potentials near si - sio@xmath2 interface at the ion site .",
    "the effect of temperature is to thermally activate the bound electrons for conduction with an activation energy @xmath30 and the plot of @xmath48 gives information on the density of states . above @xmath50 ,",
    "the temperature is sufficiently high to delocalized the electrons from their sites allowing a percolation process to be more efficient and the scattering time to be reduced .",
    "consequently , the conductivity is limited by scattering at the interface and the mobility activated with an activation @xmath31 .",
    "it is then possible to get @xmath31 of the order of @xmath51 or even smaller because the effect of high temperature is nomore to thermally activate carriers but to increase their mobility .",
    "this typically describes a process of relaxation happening at the interface like those occurring in melting glasses . as consequence",
    ", the slope of @xmath52 may give the temperature @xmath53 at which the glass transition occurs @xcite and the sodium ions start moving around their positions .",
    "we find @xmath54k . the critical temperature @xmath50 could then correspond to the necessary energy to delocalize the electrons @xcite .",
    "it is experimentally accessible by determining the temperature for which a change in the curvature of @xmath55 happens in figure 2 .",
    "figure 6 presents the variation of @xmath50 in terms of gate voltage .",
    "as expected , the value of @xmath50 decreases when the electron density and the delocalization are increased .      the presence of @xmath32 is explained by the finite value of the conductivity in the accumulation region of the mosfet . in undoped devices ,",
    "the conductivity in the same region was close to zero even at 100k .",
    "consequently , we did not find any measurable activation energy in the accumulation region in the reference devices . in the doped device ,",
    "the average value for @xmath32 is too small compared to the activation energy @xmath30 to be related to an activation to the conduction band edge and it is mostly constant over the band gap .",
    "it may however results from an activation to an upper state below the conduction band that may be inside the upper impurity band . for @xmath56v ,",
    "the value of @xmath57mev is nearly independent of the gate voltage except in the small transition region around -0.55v .",
    "it is then hardly conceivable that the variation of @xmath32 is linked to any bandwidth .",
    "this behaviour can possibly be explained by considering that the fermi energy for @xmath19 below -0.55v is pinned due to the difference in the number of states in the gap and in the band tails @xcite . in that case , the fermi energy then varies abruptly as @xmath19 is made more negative and gets pinned in the lower band .",
    "also , the presence of a band to band activation suggests that the lower band is insulating and that the upper band has a conducting region . in the case of sodium ions in the silicon oxide , the lower band states",
    "would then be fully occupied and associated with one bound electron per ion whereas the upper band states would be associated with two electrons per ion .",
    "this situation is typically found in hubbard bands @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to consider that the presence of @xmath32 is due to an electronic transition from the lower hubbard band to the upper hubbard band and that the 15mev corresponds to the hubbard gap . to strenghten this assumption , we need to compare this value to the theoretical estimates in the case of our device . according to the theoretical results of bethe @xcite on the d@xmath1 state ( i.e. two electrons bound to a donor ) , an activation from the neutral state ( sodium ion with a single electron ) to an excited na@xmath1 state is possible . taking 11.7 for the relative permittivity of silicon as well as 0.19@xmath58 for the effective mass of electrons in silicon",
    ", we obtained @xmath5917.8mev using bethe s formula for a single d@xmath1 level .",
    "because of the formation of a band the previous estimate for the activation is lowered @xcite and we obtain @xmath6015mev by taking the value of the localization length @xmath61 nm measured previously on the same device @xcite and a density of neutral donor @xmath62@xmath4 . this value is reasonable knowing the average density of donor estimated from the threshold voltage shift gives @xmath63@xmath4 . using nishimura s estimate , we also found the upper states in the d@xmath1 band are 3.9mev below the conduction band .",
    "this value has to be compared with the 8.5mev found for @xmath30 at the threshold voltage .",
    "the difference typically gives the position in energy of the conduction band edge relative to the bottom of the conduction band . in order to bring further arguments in support of the existence of a d@xmath1 band ,",
    "it is necessary to give an estimate of the value of the on - site coulomb energy @xmath64 using the same method as schiff but in two dimensions @xcite :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the localization length .",
    "the value of the localization length as well as its variation in gate voltage was calculated for the same device under the same experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "below @xmath67v , @xmath68 nm and the on - site repulsion energy is @xmath69 mev . supposing a linear relation between the gate voltage and the activation energy , it is possible to convert gate voltages into energies in the gap region at a rate of 7.7mev / v ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the energy @xmath64 then corresponds to a difference of 0.67v in the gate voltage .",
    "this agrees well with the value of the existing soft gap between @xmath70 and @xmath71v in figure 2 .",
    "we can also check the validity of our assumptions by calculating independently the value of the hubbard gap . for sufficiently low electron density , @xmath50 and @xmath53",
    "are expected to have similar values .",
    "the hubbard gap corresponds to the energy necessary to put a second electron on the same site , that is @xmath72 .",
    "we find a value of 15.7mev in agreement with the value of @xmath32 .",
    "these observations are thus compatible with the formation of hubbard bands and a mott - hubbard gap formed by coulomb interactions .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the formation of d- states in our device may result from a complex interplay between inter - site coulomb interactions , sodium density and disorder .",
    "the inter - site interactions are due to coulomb interaction between trapped electrons in silicon .",
    "these electrons are localized in silicon at the potential minima created by the ions in the oxide .",
    "disorder comes from the fluctuations in position of these minima in the plane but also from the height of the potential wells .",
    "recent studies in gaas / algaas devices with a silicon d - doped layer showed that disorder could be controlled by the position of the dopant layer relatively to the 2d electron gas @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the disorder strength in our device is at least partly related to the position of the ions relatively to the interface .",
    "we have observed three activation mechanisms in sodium - doped silicon mosfets for 20k@xmath73100k .",
    "these results are consistent with the existence of two hubbard - like bands , one with one electron per site and the second with two electrons per site @xcite .",
    "the first mechanism is an activation of electrons from the upper band edge to the conduction band edge .",
    "the second takes over the first one when the temperature is sufficiently high to delocalize electrons and corresponds to the activation of the source drain mobility .",
    "the last mechanism has been attributed to an activation of electrons from a lower band to an upper band .",
    "the theoretical expectations for the position of the bands in energy as well as the soft gap in a case of a d@xmath1 band well agree with the values obtained experimentally .",
    "it is thus likely that the transport in such a localized system could be explained within the hubbard model and that the observed upper and lower impurity bands could correspond to hubbard bands .",
    "we would like to thank drs t. bouchet and f. torregrossa from ion beam system - france for the process in the device as well as funding from the u.s .",
