    "since the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance effect,@xcite research in spintronics has been developing at a fast pace . an important requirement for practical applications of this novel technology is the generation , control and manipulation of spin - polarized currents preferably using electric fields only.@xcite spin - orbit interactions in semiconductor materials are promising tools to achieve that goal .",
    "in particular , the rashba interaction,@xcite a type of spin - orbit coupling that originates from a lack of inversion symmetry in semiconductor heterostructures ( such as inas or gaas ) , has been experimentally shown to possess a high degree of tunability using gate contacts.@xcite    since the spin - orbit interaction couples the electron momentum and its spin , the rashba field behaves as an effective magnetic field that is responsible for spin coherent oscillations , which can be exploited in spintronics .",
    "based on this property , datta and das suggested a spin field - effect transistor.@xcite it consists of a one - dimensional ballistic channel sandwiched by two ferromagnetic contacts .",
    "their proposal relies on the control of the current along the channel using the rashba interaction via a third terminal ( the gate ) and the relative orientation of the leads magnetizations .",
    "the length of the channel and the intensity of the rashba strength determine the flow of the current .",
    "realization of the spin transistor was hindered by some limitations , such as the mismatch problem ( which results in poor injection of spin - polarized current between a ferromagnet and a semiconductor)@xcite and the idealization of ballistic transport.@xcite however , recent experiments on quasi - two dimensional structures@xcite , already discussed in refs .  , have overcome these obstacles and have obtained a behavior which looks similar to the spin transistor effect .    in reality , strictly one - dimensional channels are hard to fabricate and one must deal mostly with _",
    "quasi_-one dimensional systems containing many propagating channels .",
    "confinement in the transversal direction is accomplished with potentials leading to subband spacings often smaller than a few  mev , the order of magnitude of the fermi energy in low - dimensional systems . as a consequence ,",
    "multiple subbands are populated and channel mixing effects become relevant in many situations .",
    "in fact , the rashba interaction itself includes an intersubband mixing term which couples adjacent subbands with opposite spins .",
    "this coupling has been recently demonstrated to give rise to strongly modulated conductance curves,@xcite especially close to the onset of higher - energy plateaus , due to fano interference@xcite between propagating waves and rashba induced localized levels.@xcite in the presence of in - plane magnetic fields , rashba coupling induced intersubband mixing effects are shown@xcite to reduce the visibility of anomalous conductance steps,@xcite and to produce transmission asymmetric lineshapes even in purely one - dimensional systems.@xcite    in this paper , we analyze the role of intersubband coupling effects in multichannel quantum wires .",
    "our model consists of a quantum wire with a localized rashba spin - orbit interaction coupled to ferromagnetic leads with magnetization perpendicular to the direction of the rashba field .",
    "we find that the rashba intersubband coupling term modifies the spin precession effect in a dramatic way .",
    "typically , one finds a few oscillation cycles in the conductance curves before arriving at a strongly irregular domain at high values of the rashba parameter in which case the intersubband coupling produces an effective randomization of the injected spins independent of the relative orientation of the leads magnetization .",
    "therefore , our results point out a serious limitation of the spin transistor performance , even in the ideal cases of perfect spin injection and fully ballistic propagation .    on the other hand ,",
    "rashba interaction has lately deserved much attention as a generation procedure of spin - polarized currents .",
    "several methods have been proposed in different setups ( see refs .  , although the list is by no means exhaustive ) .",
    "we here consider a simple system : a rashba quantum wire attached to two nonmagnetic leads .",
    "we find that the rashba interaction can produce a highly polarized electric current and that the effect is purely due to interchannel coupling . for quantum waveguides supporting a single propagating mode , the polarization effect vanishes.@xcite",
    "since the rashba interaction is localized , we calculate the generated polarization as a function of the interface smoothness and show that the highest values of the polarization are obtained when the transition between the regions with and without spin - orbit interaction is abrupt .    in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the physical system and establish the theoretical model to calculate the linear conductance .",
    "section  iii is devoted to the numerical results when the contacts are ferromagnetic .",
    "the spin polarization effect in the case of normal contacts is analyzed in sec .",

    "we consider a quasi - one dimensional system ( a quantum wire ) with a localized rashba interaction ( the rashba dot ) coupled to semi - infinite leads .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a sketch of the physical system .",
    "transport occurs along the @xmath0 direction .",
    "we characterize the rashba dot as a small region of length @xmath1 with strong spin - orbit coupling with strength @xmath2 .",
    "the spin polarization in the leads is described using the stoner model for itinerant ferromagnets . due to exchange interaction among the electrons ,",
    "the electronic bands in the asymptotic regions become spin split with a splitting phenomenologically given by an effective field @xmath3 , which we take as a parameter .",
    "this approximation is good at low temperatures ( lower than the curie temperature ) and for electron densities large enough so that strong correlations can be safely neglected.@xcite denoting the stoner field in left and right regions by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , the parallel configuration is described by @xmath6 while the antiparallel corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , we assume that a local gate potential @xmath8 is aligning the potential bottom of the successive regions . this way we remove unwanted conductance modifications due to the potential mismatches,@xcite thus focussing on the properties induced purely by the spin - orbit coupling",
    ".    the system hamiltonian reads @xmath9 the confinement along the direction @xmath10 , perpendicular to the current , is taken as parabolic with oscillator frequency @xmath11 , which defines the length @xmath12 .",
    "the inhomogeneous rashba coupling @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where , as usual , spin is represented by the vector of pauli matrices @xmath15 while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the cartesian components of the electron s linear momentum .",
    "the rashba intensity @xmath18 varies smoothly taking a constant value @xmath2 inside the rashba dot and vanishing elsewhere .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath16 is responsible for spin precession of an injected electron.@xcite the intersubband coupling term proportional to @xmath17 couples adjacent subbands with opposite spins .",
    "finally , the term with the derivative @xmath19 is added in eq .",
    "( [ eqr ] ) to ensure the hermitian character of the hamiltonian .    as mentioned above",
    ", the stoner field @xmath20 is constant in the left and right asymptotic regions ( @xmath21 ) and it smoothly vanishes at distances @xmath22 towards the left and right of the rashba dot .",
    "these are assumed large enough such that all evanescent states at the interface vanish before reaching the leads .",
    "the gate potential aligning the band bottom of the different regions is taken as @xmath23 .",
    "an equivalent choice but localized to the rashba dot would be @xmath24 .",
    "all spatial transitions in @xmath18 and @xmath20 are described using fermi - like type functions characterized by a small diffusivity @xmath25.@xcite in general , @xmath25 is assumed to be small enough , although we shall also discuss below the dependence with this parameter in some cases .    for a given energy @xmath26 the electron wave function fulfills schrdinger s equation @xmath27 with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "our method of solution combines discretization of the longitudinal variable @xmath0 in a uniform grid with a basis expansion in transverse eigenfunctions @xmath28 and in eigenspinors @xmath29 along a direction given by a unitary vector @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the spin quantum number while @xmath33 denotes the twofold spin discrete variable . in terms of the polar and azimuthal angles",
    "@xmath34 corresponding to the spin quantization axis @xmath30 we can write @xmath35 the transverse eigenfunctions are the solutions of the harmonic 1d oscillator @xmath36 with @xmath37    projecting eq .",
    "( [ eqs ] ) onto the basis we obtain the equations for the unknown _ channel amplitudes _ @xmath38 @xmath39 notice that the rashba interaction is the only source of interchannel coupling since , in general , the matrix element @xmath40 will be non diagonal . using the separation in two spin - orbit contributions introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqr ] ) we can write @xmath41 equations ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) clearly show that , in general , both @xmath42 and @xmath43 couple channels with opposite spins through the matrix elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "of course , if the spin quantization axis @xmath30 is chosen along the @xmath0 or @xmath10 axis then either @xmath44 or @xmath45 become diagonal .",
    "regarding the coupling between transverse modes , we notice that @xmath43 is always diagonal ( @xmath46 ) while @xmath42 is connecting modes differing in one subband index ( @xmath47 ) through the oscillator matrix element @xmath48 .",

    "( [ ccm ] ) involves a single mode @xmath49 .",
    "if , in addition , the spin axis is chosen along @xmath10 then the two spin modes uncouple and no spin oscillation is allowed ; in other directions ( @xmath0 or @xmath50 ) a rigid spin precession should be expected if all the contribution between parenthesis in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is assumed constant .",
    "this precession is the underlying working mechanism of the datta - das spin transistor.@xcite below we investigate the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ccm ] ) in the general case in order to analyze the robustness of the _ spin precession _",
    "scenario when @xmath42 is included and when space inhomogeneity in @xmath18 is also taken into account .",
    "the appendix contains the details of the employed numerical method to compute the transmission @xmath51 , i.e. , the probability amplitude from a given left incident mode @xmath52 to the right mode @xmath53 .",
    "then , using the scattering approach the linear - response conductance is given by , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the conductance quantum .",
    "for later discussion on the polarization of the transmitted current we also define the _ polarized _ conductance @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the relative polarization @xmath58 @xmath59 , @xmath60 we shall pay special attention to the multichannel case considering energies @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ ccm ] ) such that up to 10 propagating modes are active in the leads .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the results for polarized leads oriented along @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath42 is neglected the conductance for 5 and 10 propagating modes displays an almost sinusoidal behavior with only minor distortions .",
    "these deviations , which are enhanced in the single mode case , can be attributed to the quantum interference with the rashba dot.@xcite the present results confirm , therefore , the precession scenario mentioned above but only when the number of modes is large enough and interband coupling is neglected .",
    "quite remarkably , however , this scenario is not robust with the inclusion of @xmath42 .",
    "when the full rashba interaction is considered only for small values of @xmath2 the conductance behaves in a regular way .",
    "very rapidly as @xmath2 increases @xmath61 fluctuates in a staggered way that resembles the conductance fluctuations of disordered systems .",
    "the mean value , in units of @xmath62 , is @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the number of active channels , while the amplitude of the fluctuation decreases when @xmath64 increases .",
    "the existence of the first conductance minimum has been clearly seen in the experiments of ref .  .",
    "our results are in agreement with this experiment , but they also predict that successive maxima and minima are heavily distorted or even fully washed out .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the first conductance minimum for the black dots occurs at a slightly lower value of @xmath2 than that of the grey ( red color ) data , indicating that the minima @xmath65 are somewhat contracted with respect to the simple prediction from the rashba dot length : @xmath66 , with @xmath67 ( red symbols ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] contains the results for polarized leads along @xmath0 but in antiparallel directions . in this case , when @xmath68 the conductance vanishes due to the spin valve effect .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , however , the conductance rises and the spin valve effect is effectively destroyed by the presence of the rashba dot . for big enough values",
    "the system behaves similarly to the case of parallel polarized leads ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , displaying irregular oscillations around a mean value @xmath69 . for strong spin - orbit couplings and high number of modes",
    "no clear distinction between parallel and antiparallel orientations is then to be expected .",
    "this is a consequence of the strong subband mixing .",
    "in fact , if @xmath42 is neglected ( red symbols ) there is a full correspondence between the conductance nodes of the parallel geometry with the maxima of the antiparallel one ; as could expected from the simplified rigid precession scenario .",
    "the above results are not modified if other values of @xmath21 are used , provided they are large enough to ensure full polarization of the leads .",
    "the same is true for distances @xmath22 .",
    "they should be large enough to allow the decay of evanescent states at the interfaces with the rashba dot and at the points where stoner fields are switched on .",
    "we consider next polarized leads along @xmath10 and @xmath50 ; that is , in directions that are perpendicular to the quantum wire . for @xmath50 polarizations the results are very similar to the @xmath0 ones already discussed and",
    "thus will not be shown .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] contain the results for @xmath10-polarized parallel and antiparallel leads .",
    "a first conspicuous difference with the results of figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] is that the grey symbols ( red color ) do not display wide sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "the conductance when @xmath42 is neglected is actually maximal for the parallel case and stays rather constant with some small oscillations at large @xmath70 s that disappear when the number of channels increases . on the other hand , @xmath61 vanishes for the antiparallel orientation .",
    "we understand this spin - valve behavior as a complete absence of spin precession , resulting from the fact that @xmath13 is spin diagonal in this approximation [ cf .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) ] .    including @xmath42 in the @xmath10-polarized geometry again",
    "yields qualitative modifications of the linear conductance ( black symbols in figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) . except for the antiparallel one - channel case",
    ", @xmath61 shows staggering behavior at large @xmath2 s , quite similarly to the @xmath0-polarized results . on average , the conductance",
    "is somewhat reduced from the maximal value in the parallel case ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and , remarkably , takes a finite value in the antiparallel distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . for @xmath71 the antiparallel conductance",
    "has already reached a value close to @xmath72 and to the eventual saturation value .",
    "the rashba coupling is thus quite effective in allowing transmission by flipping spins of the polarized incoming electrons towards the opposite spin orientation of the outgoing ones .",
    "the single channel limit ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) is obviously an exception since even the black symbols vanish in this case .",
    "this is easily understood noticing that the incident @xmath73 mode couples in the rashba dot with modes @xmath74 , but not with @xmath75 , which is the only propagating mode in the right lead .",
    "therefore , no conduction is possible under this conditions .",
    "experimentally , the absence of conductance oscillation in the parallel @xmath10-oriented configuration has been confirmed.@xcite our results reproduce that behavior ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) and they also suggest the antiparallel @xmath10 orientation ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) as an interesting configuration for a spin - orbit - controlled device .",
    "indeed , the initial rise of conductance in the multichannel case , interpreted above as a rashba - induced destruction of the spin valve , could be used as the conducting ( on ) state of the device .",
    "one should check , however , that the evolution of @xmath76 from zero to the higher values remains smooth for increasing numbers of propagating channels .",
    "the present results do not elucidate this point but they seem to indicate that for @xmath77 propagating modes the initial rise of @xmath76 occurs more rapidly than for @xmath78 . in a future work we shall treat the continuum case , having an infinite number of transverse states , using a different approach from the present one .",
    "the results shown above are not much modified if the interfaces with the stoner fields at distaces @xmath79 and @xmath80 to the left and right of the rashba dot , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , are smoothed by increasing the corresponding fermi - function parameter.@xcite this confirms that the conductance modifications are an effect of the rashba dot , and not of the stoner field interfaces .",
    "indeed , the more diffuse the interface , the more reflectionless and thus more ideal is the description of the contact . in the next section",
    "we shall discuss the case of nonpolarized leads ( @xmath81 ) , but we have also calculated some cases of partial polarization by decreasing @xmath3 when both @xmath82 and @xmath83 transverse states are active , although their number is not perfectly balanced .",
    "we have found that the conductance is qualitatively similar to the fully polarized case , with irregular behaviour at large values of @xmath2 .",
    "it has been recently pointed out@xcite that a rashba dot can act as a current polarizer in such a way that when a non polarized current enters the dot from the left , the transmitted current to the right may attain an important degree of spin polarization in @xmath10 direction . for this to occur",
    ", it has been shown that at least two propagating modes of opposite spin must interfere.@xcite in wires with parabolic transverse confinement this means that the energy should at least exceed @xmath84 such that the four modes @xmath85 are active and the interference occurs in subsets @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the resulting spin polarization is very sensitive to the energy ( see fig .  3 of ref .  ) and a large enhancement of the polarization @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) is obtained when the energy is such that a fano - type resonance with a quasibound state from a higher evanescent band is formed .",
    "this type of resonances which lead to the fano - rashba effect was investigated in ref .  .",
    "the polarization of the transmitted current is zero if , instead of @xmath10 , other direction for the quantization axis are chosen .",
    "the preference for the transverse @xmath10 direction in polarization is an example of _ chirality _ induced by the rashba interaction .",
    "this is possible even with a time - reversal invariant hamiltonian like eq .",
    "( [ eqr ] ) because our boundary condition ( left incidence ) is not time reversal invariant .",
    "indeed , if we consider the time reversed boundary condition , i.e. , incidence from the right , the current transmitted to the left is polarized in the opposite direction .",
    "the superposition of both solutions completely restores the symmetry without any preferred spin direction .",
    "the reversal of the polarization for the right - to - left transmission can be seen as a peculiar behavior of rashba polarizers that makes them _ fragile _ in the presence of magnetic barriers like those of sec .",
    "indeed , one could naively think that when the rashba dot acts as a current polarizer the left - to - right transmission with @xmath10-magnetized leads should be very high in parallel configuration and very low in antiparallel configuration .",
    "this is not the case , however , because of multiple backwards and forwards reflections with their associated inversions of @xmath58 ( see lower panels of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .    in this section",
    "we assume nonmagnetic leads by taking @xmath88 , i.e. , vanishing stoner fields in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and analyze the evolution of the polarization and the conductance when the number of active channels increases . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] upper panel , high polarizations @xmath58 are obtained for the minimal number of channels @xmath89 and strong spin - orbit intensities @xmath2 .",
    "the clear correlation between @xmath61 and @xmath58 , conductance minima correspond to maxima in polarization , indicate that this is an effect connected with the formation of quasibound states that tend to block the current for a given spin direction . when the number of channels is increased ( lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) both @xmath61 and @xmath58 show reduced staggering oscillations with increasing @xmath70 , as in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig5 ] .",
    "there is also an overall tendency to smoothly reduce @xmath61 and increase @xmath58 in a linear way with @xmath70 . with increasing number of channels the slopes of these straight lines",
    "are reduced and for @xmath90 the polarization reaches the values @xmath91 and @xmath92 for 10 and 20 propagating channels , respectively . in almost all cases the polarization is positive , indicating that the transmitted current is preferentially polarized along @xmath93 .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss how the results are affected by the way in which the rashba field is switched on spatially .",
    "for this , we vary the parameter @xmath25 in the fermi functions describing the transitions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1].@xcite for large values of @xmath25 the edges are quite smooth and correspond to an _",
    "adiabatic _ turn - on or turn - of in space . on the contrary ,",
    "abrupt changes are given by the limit @xmath94 .",
    "our method is based on a grid discretization of the variable @xmath0 and its only requirement is that the grid should be fine enough to describe the spatial variations .",
    "the results discussed above have been obtained using @xmath95 , a rather small value describing abrupt transitions in space .",
    "we have checked that either using a smaller value @xmath96 or a larger value @xmath97 the behaviors of the conductance in the presence of polarized leads discussed in sec .",
    "ii , namely the staggering for high values of @xmath2 and the modification due to intersubband coupling , are not qualitatively changed .",
    "of course , it should be fulfilled that the rashba dot length @xmath1 is much greater than @xmath25 in order to still allow the transition to reach to the saturation value @xmath2 .",
    "more delicate is the polarization @xmath58 discussed in the preceding subsection and fig  [ fig6 ] . in fig  [ fig7 ] we show the evolution with @xmath25 of @xmath61 and @xmath58 when @xmath78 channels are propagating in the wire .",
    "the polarization vanishes when @xmath25 increases , indicating that smooth edges do not favor the appearance of polarized currents . in this diffuse - edge limit",
    "the conductance takes the maximal value @xmath98 as in a purely ballistic wire without any rashba dot .",
    "the evolution for @xmath99 ( upper panel ) is quite smooth but for @xmath100 ( lower panel ) superimposed to the overall behavior we find irregular maxima and minima as in previous results .",
    "recent experiments have proved the feasibility of the spin transistor proposed by datta and das some years ago.@xcite this device , usually presented as a paradigm of spintronics , is expected to open new ways to overcome present limitations of electronics . in this paper",
    "we have discussed some specific aspects related to the rashba interaction , including the so - called intersubband coupling , relevant for a better understanding of the physical mechanisms behind the spin transistors and spin polarizers .",
    "taking the wire containing the rashba dot oriented along @xmath0 we have analyzed the transmission in the presence of polarized leads along @xmath0 , @xmath10 or @xmath50 , and with increasing number of propagating channels .",
    "the cases of parallel and antiparallel polarized leads along @xmath0 and @xmath10 have been explicitly shown .",
    "the evolution with rashba intensity shows dramatic modifications when the rashba intersubband coupling is included .",
    "these modifications are specially relevant at strong values of @xmath2 , where staggering oscillations of @xmath61 have been found . in general ,",
    "only a first smooth oscillation of @xmath76 remains when the full rashba interaction is considered , while successive ones are heavily distorted or even fully washed out .",
    "the spin - valve behavior is effectively destroyed by the rashba dot and the conductance for both parallel and antiparallel leads is relatively high .",
    "the role of rashba dots as spin polarizers has been discussed and explicitly calculated assuming the leads to be nonpolarized .",
    "a smooth linear increase in @xmath58 with rashba intensity has been observed in the multichannel case . in the limit of adiabatic transitions the polarization vanishes .",
    "these overall smooth behaviors are superimposed by irregular changes for high values of @xmath2 .",

    "<S> we investigate intersubband mixing effects in multichannel quantum wires in the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling and attached to two terminals . </S>",
    "<S> when the contacts are ferromagnetic and their magnetization direction is perpendicular to the rashba field , the spin - transistor current is expected to depend in a oscillatory way on the rashba coupling strength due to spin coherent oscillations of the travelling electrons . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we find that the presence of many propagating modes strongly influences the spin precession effect , leading to ( i ) a quenching of the oscillations and ( ii ) strongly irregular curves for high values of the rashba coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that in the case of leads magnetization parallel to the rashba field , the conductance departs from a uniform value as the rashba strength increases . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the rashba interaction induced current polarization effects when the contacts are not magnetic and investigate how this mechanism is affected by the presence of several propagating channels . </S>"
