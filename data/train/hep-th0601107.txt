    "there have been an increasing interest in the recent years in two - boundary spin systems .",
    "this is due to theoretical and practical reasons . on one hand nepomechie @xcite and cao et al .",
    "@xcite were able to extend the diagonal bethe ansatz ( ba ) solution of the xxz spin chain @xcite to certain nondiagonal cases where a constraint is satisfied between the parameters of the two boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "on the other hand these models have interesting applications in recent problems of statistical physics with open boundaries such as the description of the asymmetric exclusion process or the raise and peel models , see for example @xcite .",
    "there are developments in similar open spin chains as well , see e.g. the result on xyz and xxx models @xcite , but the basic example is the xxz model , from which other interesting models like the lattice sine - gordon , or the lattice liouville models can be derived @xcite .    in the algebraic bethe ansatz method",
    "a pseudo vacuum vector is needed on which the action of the monodromy matrix is triangular . in the xxx @xcite , xxz @xcite and xyz @xcite models this requirement resulted in a constraint relating the parameters of the two boundary conditions .",
    "the same constraint appeared also in the functional relations approaches in @xcite for the xxz , while in @xcite for the xyz cases .",
    "since they show up also in the temperly - lieb formulation of the xxz spin chains @xcite we conclude that they are intrinsically encoded in the system .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that certain nondiagonal bcs in the two - boundary xxz spin chain are equivalent to diagonal ones .",
    "this was then extended to other spin chains in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the paper is to derive these equivalences and show the physical origin of the constraints . in doing",
    "so we analyze inhomogeneous spin chains and show , both in the periodic and in the open case , that the spectrum of the transfer matrix / hamiltonian does not depend on the actual order of the spins merely on the spin content of the chain .",
    "we define a different spin in a homogenous chain as a defect , then we demonstrate how the equivalences observed in quasi periodic xxx spin chains @xcite can be re - derived by moving defects . in the open case",
    "the nondiagonal bc is represented as a diagonal one dressed by a defect .",
    "the idea is to move the defect , by performing similarity transformations on the transfer matrix , to the other boundary in order to dress that one instead . in the xxx model dressing the generic nondiagonal bc gives rise to triangular bc if the constraint is satisfied . in the xxz model dressing the quantum group invariant",
    "bc gives diagonal bc .",
    "dressing the nondiagonal bc gives upper triangular type bc , whenever the constraint is satisfied .",
    "satisfying two constraints between the two nondiagonal bcs the spectrum can be described by diagonal bcs on both ends .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start by deriving the equivalence in the periodic chain .",
    "having summarized the notations we introduce defects and show that they can be shifted without altering the spectrum of the transfer matrix .",
    "as a consequence we derive correspondences between various periodic spin chains , and pedagogically illustrate their usage on the example of the xxx model . turning to the boundary problem we recall the notations ,",
    "then show how nondiagonal bcs can be described by dressing diagonal ones with defects .",
    "the change of the location of the defect from one side to the other leads to equivalences between different bcs . in order to demonstrate the method we analyze the xxx and the xxz models in some detail",
    "lets summarize the notations in the periodic case following the paper of sklyanin @xcite .",
    "we take a solution @xmath0 of the yang - baxter equation ( ybe)@xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) which is symmetric @xmath3 and satisfies unitarity and crossing symmetry:@xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are scalar factors , @xmath7 permutes the factors in the tensor product , @xmath8 , of the vector space @xmath9 , and the index refers to the factor in which the operators act , i.e. the ybe is an equation in @xmath10 .",
    "the transposition in the @xmath11-th tensor product factor is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "graphically the ybe is represented as    for such a solution of the ybe ( [ eq : ybe ] ) we define the associative algebra with generators @xmath13 as@xmath14 any representation can be used to define a spin chain , thus we deal with concrete representations . if @xmath15 is represented in the space @xmath16 then we denote it by @xmath17 , and the equation takes the following form@xmath18 which is called the rtt equation ( rtte ) and can be written graphically as    whenever @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two representations in @xmath21 , respectively , then @xmath22 is also a representation in @xmath23 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath24 is a solution of the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) , then @xmath25 and @xmath26 are also solutions of the same equation ( [ eq : rtte ] ) .",
    "comparing the two figures ( or the ybe ( [ eq : ybe ] ) to the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) ) we observe that we can always take @xmath27 and choose @xmath28 , which , thanks to the ybe ( [ eq : ybe ] ) , also satisfies the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) .",
    "in particular if the @xmath29-matrix , @xmath30 is related to the universal @xmath29-matrix , @xmath31 , of a quasi triangular hopf algebra as @xmath32 then @xmath33 provides a solution of the rtt algebra relations ( [ eq : rtt ] ) and any representation @xmath34 leads to a concrete realization via @xmath35 .",
    "suppose that @xmath36 are two solutions of the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) in the quantum spaces @xmath37 , then the transfer matrices @xmath38 form a commuting family of matrices , i.e. they can be considered as the generating functionals of conserved quantities for the quantum system on @xmath39 .",
    "the typical example is as follows : take a scalar representation on @xmath40 with @xmath41 and another one on the quantum space @xmath42 of the form @xmath43 where the @xmath44-s are the same representations .",
    "the transfer matrix corresponds to a closed integrable quantum spin chain with @xmath45 sites subject to quasi periodic boundary condition specified by the matrix @xmath46 , which can be represented graphically as :    note that @xmath47 is always a solution , which correspond to periodic boundary condition .",
    "if at one position the representation is changed from @xmath48 to @xmath49 acting on the space @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 then we can interpret it as a _ defect _ in the spin chain .",
    "we can change all the representations to have a chain of the form @xmath52 with the corresponding solutions @xmath53 , where for @xmath54 we can take @xmath55 and @xmath56 and choose @xmath57 to simplify the presentation .",
    "the transfer matrix can be drawn as    we claim that if there exist a matrix @xmath58 such that@xmath59 which we call the sll equation ( slle ) drawn graphically as    0    then the spectrum of the transfer matrix does not depend on the actual positions of the representations , merely on the representation content of the chain .",
    "for this we show that we can change any two neighboring operators .",
    "take@xmath60 and use the slle ( [ eq : sll ] ) to replace @xmath61 with @xmath62 , then commute the operator @xmath63 through the other @xmath64-s since they act in different quantum spaces to show that@xmath65 which can be drawn graphically as    as a consequence if we have two defects then the actual position of the defects does not matter , i.e. , they do not interact . moreover , an alternating spin chain is equivalent to two equal length homogenous chains coupled at two points together .",
    "thus the results on alternating spin chains @xcite can be reinterpreted in this sense .",
    "the slle ( [ eq : sll ] ) looks very nontrivial , but it is almost always satisfied in the spin chains considered sofar .",
    "as an example we mention , that if @xmath66 and @xmath67 then the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) is equivalent to the slle ( [ eq : sll ] ) by making the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 identification . in general if a universal @xmath31 matrix is given , then we can always choose @xmath71 which provides a solution of the slle ( [ eq : sll ] ) .",
    "lets see some concrete examples .      here for pedagogical reasons we reinterpret the results of @xcite for the @xmath72 invariant spin chain in our language .",
    "the r matrix is taken to be @xmath73 while for describing the spin @xmath74 at site @xmath75 we take the operator @xmath76 where @xmath77 represents @xmath72 with spin @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath79 we can recover the r - matrix itself @xmath80 . solving the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) we can realize that we have also scalar but @xmath81 independent solutions : @xmath82 and they correspond to the global @xmath72 symmetry of the model .",
    "( here we supposed invertibility of this matrix and normalized its determinant to one ) . it can be used either as defects in the spin chain or as the @xmath83 matrix specifying quasi periodic boundary conditions in ( [ eq : tper ] ) as follows : lets consider a chain depicted on the next figure    at site @xmath11 a spin @xmath84 representation is introduced on the quantum space @xmath85 via the operator @xmath86denoted by a thick line . between sites",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath87 two defects with matrices of the form ( [ eq : xxxdef ] ) , denoted by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are inserted .",
    "finally quasi periodic boundary condition is introduced by @xmath90 of the form ( [ eq : xxxdef ] ) .",
    "thin lines correspond to scalar solution ( [ eq : xxxdef ] ) of the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) .",
    "the @xmath91 triple can be interpreted as the dressing of the spin @xmath84 with defects and this transformation can be used to bring @xmath92 to a triangular form . as was shown in appendix b of @xcite",
    "the matrix @xmath78 exists in ( [ eq : sll ] ) so thick and thin lines can be changed by similarity transformation . as a consequence we can move the defects to the left and describe the spectrum by the following transfer matrix :    where @xmath93 or any of its cyclic permutation .",
    "lets consider two applications .",
    "take first @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 and use cyclicity to show that the spin chain with quasi periodic bcs specified by @xmath90 and @xmath97 are equivalent .",
    "this transformation can be used to diagonalize the matrix @xmath90 .",
    "if we take now @xmath98 for all @xmath11 then we realize that we can collect the defects into @xmath99 and using the previous argument we conclude that only the eigenvalues of the product of the defect matrices determine the spectrum .",
    "all these statements can be checked on the explicit ba solution of the model in @xcite , where the independence of the orders of the spins @xmath84 is also obvious .",
    "the generalization of these results for the @xmath100 case following the lines in @xcite is straightforward .",
    "consider the xxz spin chain , that is take @xmath101 to be the quasi triangular hopf algebra .",
    "the @xmath102 matrix is the universal @xmath31 matrix taken in the @xmath103 representation:@xmath104 for @xmath105 we take the same representation written as@xmath106 where the operators",
    "@xmath107 are the standard pauli matrices .",
    "the matrix structure always refers to the representation space , @xmath108 labeled by @xmath109 .",
    "this defines a spin @xmath110 chain via the transfer matrix ( [ eq : tper ] ) as shown in @xcite .    for the defect , which is relevant in the boundary problem , we take the @xmath111 representation , where @xmath112 is the q - oscillator ( @xmath113 ) representation of the hopf algebra , @xcite .",
    "this gives the following defect operator@xmath114 where @xmath115 and the infinite dimensional matrices , @xmath116 can be written in terms of the matrix units as@xmath117 we have slightly changed the basis compared to @xcite .",
    "the matrices @xmath118 are the constant solutions of the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) and are related to the global symmetries of the model .",
    "they also can be used to define quasi periodic boundary conditions as we have already seen in the example of the xxx model . the analogous solution for the defect equation in the sine - gordon theory",
    "was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the previous considerations that if we have more than one defect only their number , and not their locations , influences the spectrum .",
    "the solution of the model even with one defect is an open and interesting problem .",
    "here we would like to concentrate on how it can be used to derive equivalences in the open case and leave this analysis for a future work .",
    "in describing an open chain , additionally to the rtt algebra ( [ eq : rtt ] ) , one also introduces two algebras spanned by @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 corresponds to the right boundary and satisfies@xmath122 which is called the boundary ybe ( bybe ) and is represented graphically as    there is an analogous equation for @xmath123 ( cf .",
    "what we actually need is that the two algebras are isomorphic : for any solution @xmath124 of the right bybe ( [ eq : bybe ] ) @xmath125 solves the analogous left bybe . in dealing with spin chains we are interested in representations of these algebras @xmath126 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that taken two solutions of the bybe ( [ eq : bybe ] ) , @xmath127 , @xmath128 forms a commuting family of matrices and is the generating functional for the integrals of motions of an open quantum system .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that taking two solutions @xmath129 of the bybe ( [ eq : bybe ] ) and a solution @xmath19 of the rtte ( [ eq : rtte ] ) then @xmath130 solves the left ( [ eq : bybe ] ) , while @xmath131 the right bybe . choosing any of these _ dressed _ solutions , @xmath132 , with the other undressed one , @xmath133 , leads to the same transfer matrix : @xmath134 taking for @xmath24 the one used in the periodic chain @xmath135 the transfer matrix , @xmath136 , generates the conserved quantities for an open spin chain with bcs specified by @xmath137 and @xmath138 , written graphically as :    we can introduce defects by changing a representation at one site , or , similarly to the periodic case , we can change the representations on each site to have a more general chain with , @xmath139 whose transfer matrix , @xmath136 , can be written graphically as    now manipulations similar to those performed in the periodic case show that any two neighboring representations can be changed .",
    "this leads to a spectrally equivalent description by the transfer matrix :    we conclude again that only the representation content matters and not the actual order of the representations . in the typical applications we take a chain with @xmath54 sites and interpret the first site with operator @xmath140 as a dressing of the boundary : @xmath141 ( for algebraic analysis of this type of dynamical bcs see @xcite . )",
    "the defect can be moved to the other boundary to dress that one @xmath142 giving equivalences between different bcs , namely the system with bcs @xmath138 and @xmath143 is equivalent to the system with different bcs described by @xmath144 and @xmath145 moreover , the equivalence is independent of the bulk spin content of the chain .",
    "this isomorphism can map nondiagonal bcs to diagonal ones as we can see in the next examples .      here",
    "we follow the presentation of the open xxx model of @xcite but rewrite the results to our language .",
    "the simplest solution of the bybe ( [ eq : bybe ] ) has a diagonal form and contains one parameter@xmath146 this solution can be dressed ( [ eq : dr- ] ) by the defect @xmath147 in ( [ eq : xxxdef ] ) to obtain the most general nondiagonal one@xmath148 where the parameters of the defect @xmath147 can be calculated from @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 which is the dressed version of @xmath152 . for the ratios we have two solutions with @xmath153 as @xmath154 consider an open spin chain with bulk spins @xmath84 and boundary conditions specified by @xmath155 on the right and @xmath156 on the left , which can be drawn graphically as    just as in the bulk case we can move the defect to the other boundary and then the transfer matrix is equivalently described as    where now the left boundary is dressed ( [ eq : dr+ ] ) as @xmath157 . demanding the upper / lower triangularity of the matrix , which is needed to find a pseudo vacuum in the ba formulation , we obtain the @xmath158 constraint . under this condition",
    "ba equations for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix can be derived @xcite .",
    "if both conditions are satisfied then the spin chain with two nondiagonal bcs is equivalent to a chain with diagonal boundary conditions on both sides .",
    "one of the simplest solutions of the bybe ( [ eq : bybe ] ) is@xmath159 which corresponds to the quantum group invariant ( qgi ) chain . by dressing it ( [ eq : dr- ] ) with the defect ( [ eq : dfxxz ] ) with parameters @xmath160 and taking the @xmath161 limit we can obtain the most general diagonal solution@xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 . dressing it again ( [ eq : dr- ] ) with the defect ( [ eq : dfxxz])@xmath165",
    "we can obtain the following nondiagonal solution@xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the operators @xmath169 are the inverses of each other and can be diagonalized on the basis @xmath170 as @xmath171 thus each @xmath172 subspace is invariant under the action of @xmath144 on which it takes the most general nondiagonal form    @xmath173    where the effect of the defect is the shift in the parameter @xmath174 .",
    "our parameters are in spirit close to the parameterization used in the sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "they can be related to the @xmath175 parameters used in @xcite as @xmath176 .",
    "lets consider the two - boundary spin @xmath110 xxz chain with nondiagonal bcs on the right end ( [ eq : gen ] ) specified by @xmath177 and @xmath178 on the left end .",
    "the transfer matrix can be represented as    moving the defect to the other boundary the transfer matrix is equivalently described as    where now the left boundary is dressed .",
    "we start by deriving the equivalence found in @xcite . in doing",
    "so we take the qgi ( [ eq : qg ] ) @xmath179 bc on the left and the dressed diagonal @xmath177 on the right ( [ eq : gendyn ] ) .",
    "although the defect depends on @xmath180 the dressed boundary and correspondingly the transfer matrix does not .",
    "the dressed left boundary ( [ eq : dr+ ] ) takes the form @xmath181 since the spectrum does not depend on @xmath180 we can take the limit @xmath182 and now the dressed left boundary , @xmath143 is diagonal @xmath183 with @xmath184 , making equivalences between , nondiagonal bc @xmath185 on one end and qgi on the other , with diagonal bcs on both sides @xmath186 and @xmath187 as was observed in @xcite .    as another application",
    "we take the most general nondiagonal @xmath188 bc ( [ eq : gen ] ) with the @xmath189 parameters : @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the dressed transfer matrix takes the form @xmath192 @xmath193 we see that the @xmath172 subspace is not invariant under the action of @xmath143 since @xmath194 .",
    "( in most of the cases @xmath195 is purely imaginary ) .",
    "if we demand a highest / lowest weight property of the vector @xmath172 , or some other words , the lower / upper triangularity of the matrix we obtain the following constraint@xmath196 which , using the discrete symmetries of the model , is the analog of nepomechie s constraint @xcite .",
    "this condition is sufficient to find a reference state in the ba @xcite .",
    "the two choices of signs are related as @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "this transformation does not change the hamiltonian whose spectrum we are describing ( see @xcite ) merely its realization in terms of the transfer matrix .",
    "similarly the same hamiltonian can be described in terms of different temperly - lieb algebras @xcite and the two constraints correspond to exceptional representations of the two algebras , respectively .",
    "if we demand both constraints @xmath199 the @xmath172 subspace becomes invariant on which the dressed left boundary matrix ( [ eq : dr+ ] ) takes the form @xmath200 with @xmath201 .",
    "this shows that the two - boundary spin chain with nondiagonal bcs specified by @xmath137 and @xmath144 can be described by a spin chain with diagonal bcs specified by @xmath202 and @xmath143 on the two ends .",
    "one can check that under these circumstances the nondiagonal ba equations @xcite are equivalent to the diagonal ones @xcite .",
    "we note that the equivalences derived here are valid for any value of @xmath195 . for special values , however , the defect admits a finite dimensional representation , which might lead to other equivalences observed in @xcite , or help to understand the derivation of ba equations for special cases in @xcite .",
    "to sum up we have established an equivalence between different spin chains : we have shown that under quite general ( integrable ) circumstances the spectrum of the chain depends only on its representation ( spin ) content and not on the actual order of the representations .",
    "we have successfully applied this equivalence to make correspondence between different bcs .",
    "we demonstrated the machinery on the examples of the xxx and xxz spin @xmath110 chain , where we mapped the system with special nondiagonal bcs to diagonal ones .",
    "this equivalence is quite general , however , and can be extended to other two - boundary spin systems , like to the higher representation of @xmath72 or higher rank algebras @xcite , in order for making equivalences between different bcs .",
    "an advantage of the method is , that it is necessary to solve one model from each equivalence class only .",
    "finally we note that the analogue of dressing the boundary with defects was already analised in conformal field theories @xcite , in integrable quantum field theories @xcite and in classical field theories @xcite .",
    "the straightforward generalization of our ideas to these theories leads to equivalences between various bcs in their two - boundary versions .",
