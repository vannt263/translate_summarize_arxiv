    "spectral methods are known to achieve exponential convergence rate @xcite , which makes them particularly useful for solving numerically demanding differential eigenvalue problems which arise in hydrodynamic stability analysis @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , besides providing accurate and efficient solutions for a certain number of leading eigenvalues , spectral methods often produce physically spurious unstable modes , which can not be removed by increasing the numerical resolution @xcite .",
    "for detailed discussion of these modes we refer to boyd @xcite .",
    "such physically spurious eigenvalues can appear in all types of spectral methods including galerkin @xcite , tau @xcite and collocation approximations @xcite , unless some kind of _ ad hoc _ approach is applied to avoid them . in the galerkin method ,",
    "spurious eigenvalues can be removed by using the basis functions also as the test functions instead of separate chebyshev polynomials @xcite .",
    "a number of approaches avoiding spurious eigenvalues have also been found for the tau method @xcite . the same can be achieved also for the collocation ( or pseudospectral ) method by using two distinct interpolating polynomials @xcite . following the approach of mcfadden _",
    "et al_. @xcite for the tau method , huang and sloan @xcite use a lagrange interpolating polynomial for second - order terms which is by two orders lower than the hermite interpolant used for other terms .",
    "the choice of the latter polynomial depends on the particular combination of the boundary conditions for the problem to be solved @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to present a simple method avoiding spurious eigenmodes in the chebyshev collocations method which uses only the lagrange interpolating polynomial applicable to general boundary conditions .",
    "our approach is based on the capacitance matrix technique which is used to eliminate fictitious boundary conditions for a vorticity - type auxiliary variable .",
    "the elimination can be performed in two basically different ways which respectively produce a pair of infinite and zero spurious eigenvalues .",
    "the latter can be shifted to any prescribed value by a simple modification of the second approach .",
    "the main advantage of our method is not only its simplicity but also applicability to more general problems with complicated boundary conditions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the orr - sommerfeld problem for plane poiseuille flow , which is a standard test case for this type of method .",

    "note that instead of the commonly used maximum flow velocity , we employ the viscous diffusion speed @xmath11 as the characteristic velocity .",
    "this non - standard choice will allow us to test our numerical method against the analytical eigenvalue solution for a quiescent liquid .",

    "the growth rate @xmath22 differs by a factor @xmath31 from its standard definition .",
