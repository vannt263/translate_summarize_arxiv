    "decays of @xmath12 mesons are subject of intensive investigations . thanks to the interplay between a lot of theoretical work and the data from the @xmath13 @xmath12 factories with their detectors babar ( slac ) and belle ( kek ) as well as from the tevatron ( fnal ) , valuable insights into cp violation could be obtained during the recent years . in the standard model ( sm ) , this phenomenon is closely related to the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , and can be characterized by the unitarity triangle ( ut ) with its three angles @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this adventure will soon be continued at the lhc ( cern ) , with its dedicated @xmath12-decay experiment lhcb .    in the @xmath12-physics landscape , an interesting probe of cp violation",
    "is also offered by @xmath0 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdd - diag ] , this decay originates from @xmath17 quark - level processes , and receives contributions both from a colour - allowed tree - diagram - like topology and from penguin diagrams . in analogy to the prominent @xmath18 decay , the latter contributions lead to complications of the theoretical interpretation of the cp - violating observables .",
    "however , the penguin effects can fortunately be controlled by means of the @xmath1 channel @xcite , which is related to @xmath0 through an interchange of all down and strange quarks , as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdd - diag ] .",
    "because of this feature , the @xmath2-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions allows us to derive relations between non - perturbative hadronic parameters ,-",
    "spin flavour symmetry connects strange and down quarks in the same way through @xmath19 transformations as the isopsin symmetry connects the up and down quarks . ] so that the measurement of cp violation in @xmath0 can be converted into cp - violating weak phases . in comparison with conventional flavour - symmetry strategies",
    "@xcite , the advantage of the @xmath2-spin method is that no additional dynamical assumptions are needed , and that also electroweak ( ew ) penguin contributions are automatically included .",
    "the key observables are the cp - averaged branching ratios as well as the direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , which enter the following time - dependent rate asymmetry @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass difference of the @xmath24 mass eigenstates .",
    "the belle collaboration has recently reported evidence for cp violation in @xmath0 , which could not be confirmed by babar .",
    "the current status reads as follows : @xmath25 @xmath26 the heavy flavour averaging group ( hfag ) gives the following averages @xcite : @xmath27 which have to be taken with great care in view of the inconsistency between the babar and belle measurements . concerning the cp - averaged branching ratio , we have @xmath28 yielding the average of @xmath29 .",
    "thanks to the updated belle result , this number is now about @xmath30 lower than the hfag value of @xmath31 @xcite . the cdf collaboration has recently observed the first signals of the @xmath11 decay @xcite , which correspond to the cp - averaged branching ratio @xmath32 performing a run on the @xmath33 resonance , also the belle collaboration has recently obtained an upper bound of @xmath34 ( 90% c.l . ) for this branching ratio @xcite .",
    "moreover , the d0 collaboration has performed a first analysis of the combined @xmath35 branching ratio , with the result of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "although the current experimental picture is still in an early stage , it raises several questions , which are further motivated by the quickly approaching start of the lhc :    * what is the allowed sm region for the cp violation in @xmath0 ? * what are the most promising strategies for the extraction of weak phases ? * what is the interplay with other measurements of cp violation and the search for new physics ( np ) ?",
    "these items are the central target of this paper .",
    "it is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : obs - space ] , we explore the parameter space of the cp - violating @xmath0 asymmetries , taking also the constraints from @xmath1 and similar modes into account , and perform a theoretical estimate of the corresponding observables in section  [ sec : esti ] . in section  [ sec : extr ] , we discuss the extraction of cp - violating phases from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , while the interplay with other cp probes is discussed in section  [ sec : inter ] . finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",

    "if this effect is attributed to np , the standard interpretation is through cp - violating contributions to @xmath3@xmath46 mixing , with a np phase @xmath218 @xcite .",
    "however , the np effects could also enter through the @xmath9 amplitude , where ew penguin topologies , which have a sizeable impact on this decay @xcite , offer a particularly interesting scenario .",
    "the @xmath12-factory data for @xmath219 modes may actually indicate a modified ew penguin sector with a large cp - violating np phase through the results for mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath220 @xcite , thereby complementing the pattern of such cp asymmetries observed in other @xmath221 penguin modes , where the @xmath222 channel is an outstanding example @xcite .",
    "the sign of the corresponding cp - violating np phase would actually shift @xmath223 in the right direction @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature of the @xmath113 decays is that they are essentially unaffected by such a np scenario as ew penguins contribute only in colour - suppressed form and play a minor rle .",
    "consequently , a difference between the values of @xmath45 extracted from @xmath224 and the @xmath113 system could reveal such effects .",
    "a similar comment applies to the determination of the @xmath4@xmath188 mixing phase , where the  golden \" strategy uses mixing - induced cp violation in the time - dependent angular distribution of the @xmath225\\phi[\\to k^+k^-]$ ] decay products @xcite ; penguin effects can be controlled with the help of @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "this determination of @xmath194 could also be affected by cp - violating np contributions entering through ew penguin topologies . on the other hand ,",
    "the extraction discussed in subsection  [ ssec : phis - extr ] is essentially unaffected , so that a difference between the two results could again signal such a kind of physics beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , also a simultaneous analysis of the @xmath2-spin - related @xmath227 decays should be performed @xcite . in analogy to the discussion given above , the ( small ) penguin effects in the determination of @xmath45 from @xmath224 can then be controlled , and @xmath194 could be extracted from the @xmath228 channel @xmath229 , again with a sensitivity to a modified cp - violating ew penguin sector .    as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis of the @xmath91 decays can also straightforwardly be applied to the @xmath230 system .",
    "following these lines , the penguin effects in the determination of @xmath231 from the @xmath221 penguin decay @xmath232 can be included through its @xmath233 partner @xcite ; and @xmath233 take the rles of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "] this is also the case for the corresponding @xmath234 decays @xcite . again in these transitions , ew penguin have a very small impact .",
    "should the interesting pattern in the mixing - induced cp asymmetries of @xmath235 , @xmath236 and similar modes originate from a modified ew penguin sector , we would again not see it in the @xmath237 system .",
    "the cp violation in @xmath0 offers another interesting probe for the exploration of the kobayashi  maskawa mechanism of cp violation . in these studies ,",
    "the penguin effects have to be controlled , which can be done with the help of the @xmath2-spin - related @xmath11 channel . motivated by the recent data from the @xmath12 factories and the tevatron , as well as the quickly approaching start of the lhc",
    ", we have investigated the allowed region in the space of the mixing - induced and direct cp violation of the @xmath0 decay , with useful results to monitor the future improvement of the experimental picture , and have performed theoretical estimates of the relevant hadronic parameters and observables .",
    "we then discussed the extraction of cp - violating phases , where we may either use @xmath45 as an input to determine @xmath16 , or use @xmath16 to extract @xmath45 . concerning the former option , the current data point towards an unstable situation for the extraction of @xmath16 , while the strong phase @xmath62 could be well determined .",
    "it appears therefore more interesting to extract the @xmath3@xmath46 mixing phase from the cp asymmetries of @xmath0 , also since precision measurements of @xmath16 will be available from the lhcb experiment through other strategies .",
    "we have provided the formalism to include the penguin effects , and have illustrated its practical implementation . in the case of the cp asymmetries of the @xmath11 decay , the penguin effects are doubly cabibbo - suppressed and play therefore a significantly less pronounced rle .",
    "however , they can also be taken into account with the help of the @xmath0 decay , allowing then a precision measurement of the @xmath4@xmath188 mixing phase from the mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath11 .",
    "an interesting feature of these determinations is the fact that they are insensitive to cp - violating np contributions entering through the ew penguin sector . in this respect , they are complementary to the well - known standard strategies . the determinations of the @xmath4@xmath188 mixing phase through the @xmath238 system on the one hand and @xmath239 , @xmath226 on the other hand are particularly promising , and the studies of lhcb in this direction should be further pursued to fully exploit the physics potential of these decays .",
