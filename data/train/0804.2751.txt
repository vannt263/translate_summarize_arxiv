    "graphene is a two dimensional system made solely of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice . since its isolation@xcite in the late 2004 , it has attracted a great deal of attention due to its unconventional physical properties . together with this wonderful system it was also possible to produce its layered relatives , like the graphene bilayer , trilayer , etc .",
    "the physical properties of single layer graphene are governed by the elementary excitations around the fermi surface , which in graphene is made of only six points in the brillouin zone , located at momenta values denominated @xmath0 and @xmath1 points @xcite .",
    "these elementary excitation are massless dirac particles , described by the @xmath2 dirac equation .",
    "the unusual properties of graphene are therefore a consequence of the fact that the emergent physical theory of this system is not the usual schrdinger equation but instead a relativistic problem . for the layered systems the situation is also equally interesting .",
    "for example for the bilayer case , although the low energy spectrum is parabolic , the effective theory is that of massive chiral particles@xcite and again not the usual schrdinger equation .",
    "both graphene and its bilayer are expected to integrate the next generation of nanoelectronic devices@xcite .",
    "however , both graphene and its bilayer do not present an energy gap in the spectrum , preventing large on - off signal ratios in possible electronic devices . in the case of graphene",
    ", there is also a finite conductivity value@xcite at the neutrality point , which prevents the pinch - off of the field effect transistor .",
    "clearly , what is necessary for having full working devices made of graphene is an energy gap in the spectrum , as in the usual semiconductors devices .",
    "there are at the moment two different proposals for producing energy gaps in the spectrum of graphene .",
    "the first is by producing graphene nanoribbons @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies @xcite show that depending on the type of terminations a graphene ribbon may have , the mechanisms for the opening of a gap will be different . for zig - zag nanoribbons ,",
    "the existence of edge states@xcite would prevent the existence of an energy gap",
    ". however , the system finds a way out by inducing magnetization@xcite at the edges and opening a gap in the spectrum .",
    "the same happens in a graphene bilayer with zig - zag edges @xcite . for nanoribbons with armchair edges ,",
    "the gaps are formed due to quantum confinement , and the value of the gap depends on the width of the ribbon . for ribbons smaller than 10  nm on",
    "/ off ratios as large as 10@xmath3 have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "another method of producing a gap in the spectrum of graphene is by depositing graphene on top a boron nitride ( bn ) @xcite .",
    "this material is a band gap insulator with a boron to nitrogen distance of the order of 1.45  @xcite , ( in graphene the carbon - carbon distance is 1.42   ) and a gap of the order of 4  ev .",
    "it was shown that in the most stable configuration , where a carbon is on top of a boron and the other carbon in the unit cell is centered above a bn ring , the value of the induced gap is of the order of 53  mev .",
    "depositing graphene on a metal surface with a bn buffer layer leads to @xmath4doped graphene with an energy gap of 0.5 ev@xcite .",
    "the existence of energy gaps in the spectrum of graphene also prevents the occurrence of the klein paradox @xcite , which would be another limiting source to the effective pinch off of the field effect transistor .",
    "the situation in bilayer graphene is also being unveiled experimentally .",
    "it has already been demonstrated that it is possible to open a gap in the spectrum of the bilayer when this material is deposited on top of silicon carbide ( sic ) and its exposed face is covered with potassium atoms @xcite .",
    "the value of the gap is , in this case , connected to the amount of doping the potassium atoms induce . using a similar method , it was experimentally demonstrated the opening of a gap in a bilayer deposited on top of silicon oxide , by covering its exposed face with ammonia molecules @xcite . in both these methods , the value of the gap and the amount of doping are interconnected .",
    "recently@xcite , a device with both a top- and a back- gate setups became available , which allows to control the value of the gap in the bilayer spectrum and the amount of charge carrier independently .",
    "> from the above experimental studies it is clear that covering the bilayer system with some atomic species will lead to a gap in the spectrum .",
    "these results motivated first principle studies@xcite of gap formation in graphene bilayer leading to calculated gaps in the interval 0.64 - 3 ev .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of covering both graphene and its bilayer with water and ammonia , showing that in both cases this covering leads to a gap in the spectrum , albeit smaller than those reported in ref . [ ] .",
    "our results for the induced gaps in the graphene bilayer are compatible with those determined for this system by measuring the cyclotron masses of the charge carriers @xcite .",
    "we are interested in describing the effect that covering graphene and its bilayer with water and ammonia has in their electronic spectra and in particular in the appearance of an energy gap in the spectrum .",
    "there is strong experimental evidence for the presence of water in graphene@xcite , and there are working graphene devices based on covering one of the surfaces of the graphene bilayer with ammonia@xcite .",
    "therefore our motivation is to understand from first principles how these two types of molecules change the electronic spectrum near the dirac point .",
    "the method we use in our investigation rests upon the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "in particular , the calculations were performed using the density functional code aimpro@xcite . in what follows",
    "we give the relevant details of our calculations .    the brillouin - zone ( bz )",
    "was sampled for integrations according to the scheme proposed by monkhorst - pack@xcite .",
    "a grid of @xmath5  @xmath6-points was generated and folded according to the symmetry of the bz .",
    "an increase in the number of points did not result in a significant total energy change .",
    "we use pseudopotentials to describe the ion cores .",
    "lower states ( core states ) are accounted for by using the dual - space separable pseudopotentials by hartwigsen , goedecker , and hutter@xcite .",
    "the valence states are expanded over a set of @xmath7- , @xmath8- , and @xmath9-like cartesian - gaussian bloch atom - centered functions , and fermi - filled using a value of @xmath10  ev .",
    "kohn - sham states are expressed as linear combinations of these basis functions .",
    "the basis functions were optimized for graphene , water and ammonia separately .",
    "the calculation of potential terms is more efficient in reciprocal space , and therefore the electron density is fourier transformed by using plane waves with kinetic energy of up to 300  ry .",
    "graphene was modeled in a slab geometry by including a vacuum region in a supercell containing 8 carbon atoms .",
    "different sizes were also tested , as well as several water or ammonia molecules concentrations per supercell , leading to very different molecular surface densities but to only small changes in the gap values . in the normal direction ( z - direction ) , the vacuum separating repeating slabs has more than 30   .",
    "the size of the supercell in the @xmath11-direction was optimized to make sure there was no interaction between repeating slabs .    in the calculations , all the atoms were fully relaxed to their equilibrium positions .",
    "that is to say that the final structure of the system is that obtained by energy minimization and is not imposed externally .",
    "consequently all the distances found below are a consequence of energy minimization of the full structure .",
    "the electronic band structure for the path @xmath12 was calculated for all the structures .",
    "since the supercell is much larger than the primitive cell , the bands appear folded in the graphs .",
    "the electronic density of states ( dos ) was calculated by sampling 12800 points in the bz , and broadened with a 0.1   ev gaussian width .",
    "the binding energies were calculated by subtracting the total energies of the graphene sample and the molecule calculated separately from the total energy of the graphene plus molecule .",
    "figure [ fig : gw-8c ] shows the relaxed water molecule on the top of the graphene . in this calculation , water concentration is very low ( one water molecule per 8 carbon atoms , or a density of about 6  nm@xmath13 ) and this results in low interaction between the water molecules , meaning that each water molecule acts like an independent scattering center .",
    "one of the hydrogen atoms binds to a carbon atom , and the carbon atoms move from their initial positions , specially in the @xmath11-direction ( as much as 0.05   ) .",
    "the presence of water therefore breaks the a - b symmetry of the graphene lattice structure .",
    "this , as we shall see , will affect the electronic states ( see section [ electronic ] ) , specially close to the dirac point .",
    "the same happens when we add ammonia .",
    "the ammonia in the top of the graphene ( figure [ fig : ga-8c ] ) has a higher binding energy ( see table [ table : energies ] ) since it binds through two hydrogen atoms , and not through one , as the water molecule .",
    "table [ table : distances ] shows the distances between the heaviest atom of the water and the ammonia molecules and the closest carbon atom .",
    "we choose the position of the heavier atoms of the molecules as a reference because their position can usually be measured using techniques such as low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) , x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) , ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups ) , and electron - energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels)@xcite .",
    "our results show a much higher binding energy than the ones obtained by other authors@xcite .",
    "we believe this is because those authors impose restrictions to the rotation of the molecules on the top of graphene ; we observed that our molecules never relaxed to those positions , but rotate instead to more favorable orientations .    when a second layer of graphene is added , a bilayer is obtained .",
    "the usual stacking of the graphene bilayer is the bernal staking , although there are situations where rotational defects may also be present@xcite . in the bernal",
    "stacking two of the carbon atoms , each belonging to different layers , are positioned exactly on top of each other . for these atoms we have found that they move away from the plane as much as 0.004   .",
    "the distance between layers ( measured as the distance between two carbon atoms that are superimposed in the bernal stacking ) is 2.6   .",
    "this is lower than the interplain distance on graphite .",
    "we believe this is due to the absence of layers on both sides of the bilayer .",
    "the bilayer has a binding energy per carbon atom of 0.21  ev , and both the water and the ammonia molecules are less bound to the bilayer than to graphene .",
    "this is because in the bilayer the carbon atoms near the molecules also have to share electrons with the underlying carbon layer .",
    "in fact , the hydrogen of the molecule that is closer to the surface binds to a carbon atom that has no other carbon atom below . in every case",
    "the binding energy is high and so desorption by thermal evaporation at room temperature is not expected .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental finding that graphene usually has adsorbed water@xcite .",
    ".distances between oxygen and nitrogen and the closest carbon atom of graphene [ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the adsorption of water and ammonia on the top of the graphene and graphene bilayer was studied .",
    "the position and orientation of these molecules relative to the surfaces was obtained as well as the binding energies .",
    "the high values of the binding energies ( of the order of the ev ) indicates that desorption of these molecules can not be obtained at room temperature , and a surface coverage is expected if the surfaces are exposed to water or ammonia .",
    "we have showed that a gap opens up in the band structure when molecules adhere to the surface , both on graphene and on the bilayer , and its value is of the order of a few tens of mev .",
    "the mechanism for opening an energy gap may be different for the graphene single and bilayer , since the random distribution of the molecules on the single layer may not break the a - b symmetry in average while the gap - opening in the bilayer is related to the symmetry between top and bottom layers .",
    "we therefore have showed the existence of a feasible method to produce graphenes with gaps in their spectrum , which is not restricted to the manipulation of nanoribbons .",
    "we found that the gap is in general displaced away from the dirac point .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the support of the fundao para a cincia e a tecnologia ( fct ) under the search ( services and advanced research computing with htc / hpc clusters ) project , funded by fct under contract conc - reeq/443/2005 .",
