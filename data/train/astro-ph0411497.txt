    "superwinds are multi - phase , loosely - collimated galaxy - sized outflows with measured velocities in excess of several hundred to a thousand kilometers per second , driven from galaxies experiencing intense recent or ongoing star - formation , i.e. starburst galaxies .",
    "superwinds are believed to be driven by the thermal and ram pressure of an initially very hot ( @xmath0 k ) , high pressure ( @xmath1 k @xmath2 ) and low density wind created from the merged remnants of very large numbers of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the thermalized sn and stellar wind ejecta predicted by this model is too hot and too tenuous to be easily observed .",
    "however hydrodynamical models of superwinds show that the wind fluid sweeps up and incorporates larger masses of ambient galactic disk and halo interstellar medium ( ism ) into the superwind , material which is more easily detected observationally .",
    "recent observations of ovi absorption and emission from @xmath3 k gas in the far ultraviolet , and thermal emission from @xmath4 k gas in x - ray regime , have shown that the majority of the soft x - ray emission in superwinds is not due to the wind fluid itself , but arises from some form of interaction between the wind gas and denser ambient disk or halo ism . here",
    "we present preliminary results of high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of a superwind with an embedded cool cloud . in this model",
    "we include the effect of thermal conduction , which we show plays an important role in shaping both the dynamics and radiative properties of the resulting wind / cloud interaction .",
    "we compare the simulated ovi and soft x - ray properties to the existing observational data .",
    "in our models we make the following simplifying assumptions : the clouds are initially spherical , at rest and in pressure equilibrium with the ambient gas ; magnetic fields and cloud self - gravity are neglected .",
    "we run several models with different values of the wind temperature @xmath5 k ) , wind hydrogen number density @xmath6 @xmath7 and wind velocity @xmath8 km s@xmath9 . here",
    "we present results relative to the model with @xmath10 k , @xmath11 @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath12 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the cloud properties are the same in all models : radius @xmath14 pc , temperature @xmath15 k and density @xmath16 @xmath2 ( total mass @xmath17 ) .",
    "we integrated the hydrodynamical equations with a 2d hydrocode developed by the bologna group .",
    "it is based on an explicit , second order upwind method which makes use of the van leer interpolation method and of the consistent advection .",
    "the method operates on a staggered grid and is implemented with thermal conduction . following cowie and mckee ( 1977 ) we adopt saturated fluxes to avoid unphysical heat transport in presence of steep temperature gradients .",
    "the model presented here is run on a grid with @xmath18 mesh points , with a central uniform region of @xmath19 points and a mesh size @xmath20 pc , while in the outer regions the mesh size increases logarithmically .",
    "calculations of the ovi and soft x - ray luminosities and 2-dimensional maps of the volume emissivities from these models were performed separately from the simulations themselves .",
    "we assumed that the plasma is in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "the ovi emissivities we use are based on the mekal hot plasma code ( e.g. mewe et al 1985 ) .",
    "note that the luminosity quoted is the sum of the two lines in the @xmath21    and 1038    doublet .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosities we quote are in the 0.3 - 2.0 kev energy band , chosen to correspond to the energy band used in the @xmath22 acis observations we compare to .",
    "the x - ray emissivities used are based on the 1993 update to the raymond & smith ( 1977 ) hot plasma code .",
    "for convenience we calculated all luminosities and volume emissivities assuming solar abundances ( as given in anders & grevesse 1989 ) , which is the commonly used standard in x - ray astronomy ) , although the cloud and wind material may well have different metal abundances .",
    "as the wind moves supersonically ( mach number = 3.2 ) a bow shock forms around the cloud , while a transmitted shock is driven into the cloud . in absence of heat conduction",
    "such an interaction leads to a fragmentation of the cloud due to kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) and rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instabilities ( e.g. klein et al . 1994 ; fragile et al 2004 ) in a typical timescale @xmath23 ( @xmath24 yr for this model ) .",
    "the inclusion of heat conduction has the effect of stabilizing the cloud , as it has the tendency to smooth out the temperature and density gradients such that the k - h instability is noticeably reduced .",
    "the heat conduction flux is also responsible for the reduction of the r - t instability .    )",
    "the distances are given in pc . at the beginning of the simulation",
    "the cloud centre is at @xmath25 pc.,title=\"fig : \" ] .1 in    in fact , in the conditions met in our simulations , the strong heat flux at the cloud edge generates a converging shock which compresses the cloud ( cowie and mckee 1977 ) ; the reduction of the cloud size implies a reduction of the momentum transfer from the superwind to the cloud , and thus of the cloud acceleration responsible of the r - t instabilities . as a consequence the cloud remains more compact with bound edges .",
    "the behavior of the cloud is shown in fig .",
    "1 . after 0.15 myr",
    "the cloud is still roughly spherical ; however the formation of the converging shock at its edge is clearly visible . at 0.30 myr",
    "the cloud reaches its minimum size and then re - expands mostly downstream where it is not contrasted by the effect of the ram pressure of the incoming superwind .",
    "the shrinking of the cloud leads to a reduction the evaporating rate @xmath26 that varies in pace with the radius .",
    "after 1 myr the cloud retains half of its initial mass while the rest has evaporated and mixed with the superwind material .",
    "in general we found that due to dynamical effect , the lifetime of our evaporating clouds is 2 - 3 times longer than that provided by the analytical solution of a steady evaporation cloud ( see cowie & mckee 1977 ) .",
    "it turns out that the cloud can survive from 1 - 13 myr depending on the parameters of the wind .",
    "figure 2 shows the ovi and the x - ray maps of the model presented here .",
    "as a gas element evaporates from the cloud , it quickly goes through a large interval of temperatures , ranging from @xmath27 k where the ovi emission peaks , up to x - ray temperatures ( several @xmath28 k ) . thus significant ovi and",
    "x - ray emissions originate close to the cloud surface , and are spatially connected .",
    "for this reason their time evolution is connected to the cloud dynamics , in particular to the variation of the cloud density at @xmath29 and to the evolution of the cloud size .",
    "@xmath2 ) is shown.,title=\"fig : \" ] .1 in    the ovi luminosity @xmath30 oscillates in time between @xmath31 and @xmath32 erg s@xmath13 with a period of 0.7 myr ( see fig .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath33 oscillates with the same period , but to a lesser extent between @xmath34 and @xmath35 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "this lower amplitude is due to the fact that the soft x - ray flux originates not only close to the cloud surface , but also behind the bow shock ; this second component is quite steady and reduces the overall x - ray variability .",
    "we point out that the ovi and x - ray luminosities have a maximum at the leading edge of the cloud close to the symmetry axis , where the density of the evaporating gas is maximum .",
    "this is due in part to the larger temperature of the shocked superwind , and partially to the compression given by the ram pressure . from fig",
    "3 is clear that in the model in which the effect of heat conduction is negletted , both @xmath33 and @xmath30 are incresing with time according to the fragmentation of the cloud .    in general",
    "only a small fraction ( @xmath36 ) of the mechanical energy of the wind that collides with the cloud is radiated away from the cloud itself at fuv and x - ray wavelenghths .",
    "being the physical size of the observational @xmath37 30 \" aperture dependent on the distance to the observed galaxies ( equivalent to @xmath38 530 pc for m82 , and for @xmath38 2.5 kpc for ngc 3079 ) , and that we do not know how many clouds actually lie within these regions , our quantitative comparison to the observational data will concentrate on the ratio of ovi to soft x - ray emission , rather than the absolute emitted luminosities .",
    "actually in our model with conduction the ratio @xmath39 assumes the values @xmath40 that are observed in ngc 4631 ( otte et al .",
    "2003 ) and m82 ( hoopes et al .",
    "2003 ) for a considerable fraction of the time simulation .",
    "we stress that the analogous model without thermal conduction gives a ratio @xmath39 much higher , largely out of the observed range .",
    ".1 in    in addition to calculating the x - ray and ovi emission we also condsider absorption line properties , specifically column densities of the ovi ions probed in @xmath37 observations of starbursts ( see e.g. heckman et al . 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "the mean value of log@xmath41 through the center of the cloud averaged over a radius of @xmath42 pc is @xmath43 for the model without heat conduction and @xmath44 for the model with heat conduction .",
    "it is known that the abundance of the x - ray emitting gas in starburst galaxies is rather puzzling .",
    "although the superwind gas is supposed to be composed mainly by sn ejecta , its metal abundance derived from its x - ray emission is consistent with solar abundance of the @xmath45-elements ( strickland et al .",
    "2004a ) . in our model",
    "the emitting gas is composed by a mixture of evaporating cloud gas with metallicity @xmath46 and enriched superwind material with metallicity @xmath47 . thus the observed metallicity is given by @xmath48 ) , where @xmath49 ) is weighted by the x - ray emission .",
    "@xmath50 may be quite low for low values of @xmath51 ; this is actually the case for this model where @xmath51 varies within the range 0.1 - 0.4 ( i.e. the observed abundance will be @xmath52 , which should be @xmath38 solar ) .",
    "much lower values of @xmath51 may be obtained varying some parameters : for instance , for @xmath53 km s@xmath13 @xmath51 can be as low as 0.02 .",
