    "consider @xmath0 brownian motion with drift in @xmath1 , starting from 0 , with the drift at each point @xmath2 being @xmath3 for a certain differentiable function @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath0 satisfies the sde @xmath5 with @xmath6 a standard brownian motion .",
    "this is called diffusion in the environment @xmath4 , and it has @xmath7 as an invariant measure . in statistical mechanics terms , @xmath4 gives the energy profile , and the above sde defines the langevin dynamics for the corresponding measure @xmath7 .",
    "the diffusion likes to go downhill on the environment @xmath4 , decreasing the energy , and thus it tends to stay around local minima of @xmath4 .",
    "if the set @xmath8 of local minima of @xmath4 is non - empty , the diffusion exhibits metastable behavior , with metastable states being the points of @xmath8 ( see @xcite , section 8) .",
    "now , for each point @xmath9 of local minimum , there are intervals @xmath10 $ ] containing @xmath9 with the property that @xmath11 is the minimum value of @xmath4 in @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 are the maximum values of @xmath4 in the intervals @xmath14 , [ x_0 , c]$ ] respectively .",
    "let @xmath15 $ ] be the maximal such interval .",
    "this is the `` interval of influence '' for @xmath9 .",
    "we call @xmath16 the * well * of @xmath9 , the number @xmath17 the * depth * of the well , and @xmath9 the * bottom * of the well .",
    "if the diffusion starts inside @xmath18 , typically it is trapped in that interval for a time that depends predominantly on the depth of the well .    also , for @xmath19 , we say that the local minimum @xmath9 is a point of * @xmath20-minimum * for @xmath4 if the depth of its well is at least @xmath20 , while a point @xmath9 is called a point of * @xmath20-maximum * for @xmath4 if it is a point of @xmath20-minimum for @xmath21 .",
    "a case of particular interest is the one where the function @xmath4 above is a `` typical '' two sided wiener path with @xmath22 . of course , an @xmath4 picked from the wiener measure is not differentiable , but there is a way to make sense of the above sde defining @xmath23 through a time and space transformation .",
    "see @xcite for the construction .    from now on , we will denote the two sided wiener path with @xmath24 . due to the nature of a typical wiener path ,",
    "once the diffusion exits an interval @xmath18 , it is trapped in another well .",
    "we will define a process @xmath25 that records some local minima of the path of @xmath24 in the order that are visited by a typical diffusion path , but not all of them .",
    "roughly , assuming that the value of the process at some point is @xmath9 , its next value is going to be the unique local minumum @xmath26 whose interval of influence is the smallest one satisfying @xmath27 .",
    "the well @xmath28 is the minimal one containing strictly @xmath29 , it is the first well right after @xmath18 that can trap the diffusion for considerably more time , and this because it has greater depth .",
    "the formal definition of the process @xmath25 goes as follows . with probability one , for all @xmath19 , there are @xmath30 points of @xmath20-extremum ( @xmath20-mimimum or @xmath20-maximum ) for @xmath24 closest to zero from the left and right respectively .",
    "exactly one of them is a point of @xmath20-minimum for @xmath24 .",
    "this we denote by @xmath31 .",
    "the process @xmath32 has piecewise constant paths , it is left continuous , and there are several results showing its impact on the behavior of the diffusion . for example , @xmath33 converges in distribution as @xmath34 ( @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath25 gives a good prediction for the location @xmath35 of the diffusion at large times .",
    "note also that , by brownian scaling , for @xmath36 the process @xmath25 satisfies @xmath37    we would like to study the set of points where @xmath25 jumps , because this shows how frequently the diffusion discovers the bottom of a well that is deeper than any well encountered by then .",
    "it turns out that it is more convenient to consider this set in logarithmic scale , that is , the point process @xmath38 the purpose of this work is to describe the structure of @xmath39 .",
    "a crucial observation is that the law of @xmath39 is translation invariant because of the scaling relation for @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath24 is continuous , the set @xmath39 has no finite accumulation point .    for any set @xmath40 define @xmath41 , the cardinality of @xmath42 , i.e.",
    ", @xmath43 is the counting measure induced by @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath40 is an interval , we will write @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "the following result ( theorem 2.4.13 in @xcite ) gives the probability that @xmath39 does not hit an interval .",
    "[ dgzthm ] for @xmath46 , @xmath47=0)=\\frac{1}{t^2}\\left(\\frac{5}{3}-\\frac{2}{3}e^{1-t } \\right).\\ ] ]    this allows us to compute the mean density , @xmath48 $ ] , of the process , because for a simple stationary point process , its mean density equals also its intensity @xmath49>0)$ ] ( proposition 3.3 iv in @xcite ) .",
    "thus we get the following result , which has been predicted by physicists ( relation ( 84 ) in @xcite ) via renormalization arguments .    [ frequency ] for every borel set @xmath50 , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is lebesgue measure",
    ". moreover , @xmath53}{t } = \\frac{4}{3 } { \\mbox{\\hspace{.3 cm } a.s.}}\\ ] ]    in section [ elementaryproof ] , we give an easy proof of this corollary which avoids the use of theorem [ dgzthm ] .    combining this with well known localization results for the diffusion , we infer that the diffusion jumps to a deeper well extremely rarely , at times that progress roughly as @xmath54 .",
    "we also remark that for the process @xmath55 , which is a subset of @xmath39 , it was shown in @xcite that it has mean density 1/3 . on average , one in every four consecutive jumps",
    "is a sign change .",
