    "continuous quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) and behaviour of quantum systems in vicinity of the corresponding quantum critical points attract a great research interest@xcite both in theory and in experiment .",
    "there are manifestations of such effects in cuprate superconductors , in iron pnictides and in other materials .",
    "qpt are most pronounced in low dimensional systems , but they also occur in three dimensional ( 3d ) systems . in the present paper we consider quantum systems",
    ", therefore 3d means 3d+time . a well known material that manifests the 3d magnetic quantum critical behaviour is tlcucl@xmath1 . magnetic and other properties of the compound has been extensively studied experimentally .",
    "@xcite under normal conditions the material is nonmagnetic , while a magnetic field and/or pressure drives a qpt to the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "an analogous material kcucl@xmath1 have similar properties .",
    "@xcite it has been understood that tlcucl@xmath1 consists of a 3d set of spin dimers and the qpt in the magnetic field can be considered as bose condensation of the spin dimer triplet excitations ( triplons ) .",
    "@xcite the pressure induced qpt can be also described in terms of triplons.@xcite inelastic neutron scattering from the magnetically ordered phase in the vicinity of the pressure induced qpt  @xcite clearly indicates two transverse and one longitudinal spin - wave excitation modes as one would expect for condensed triplons . according to the data  @xcite the longitudinal spin - wave excitation has a finite width .",
    "generically this is also expected because of the possibility for the longitudinal mode to decay to two transverse spin - wave excitations .",
    "however to the best of our knowledge this width has never been calculated . in the present work",
    "we perform such a calculation and compare the result with the experimental data .",
    "the width is related to theparameters of the bose condensate of magnons observed in the same compound in the external magnetic field .",
    "on the technical side in the present work we use the effective quantum field theory approach .",
    "as we pointed out , a description of the system in terms of the spin dimer triplon technique is also possible . the spin dimer technique accounts for both the short range and the long range dynamics on equal footing .",
    "on the one hand , this is a strength of this description . on the other hand ,",
    "the description is quite technically involved if one needs to analyze the interaction effects that we are after .",
    "the technical complexity is a price for the universality .",
    "the effective quantum field theory method adopted in the present work , allows us to account for the interaction effects much more accurately .",
    "the method does not account for the short range dynamics , but the short range effects are irrelevant in the vicinity of a qpt .",
    "we would like also to note that in the present paper we use terms `` spin waves '' and `` magnons '' on equal footing , having in mind magnetic excitations on both sides of the qpt .",
    "the qpt that we consider here is a continuous zero temperature transition .",
    "therefore , the short range dynamics are not changed in the qpt , only the long range dynamics are changed . in this situation",
    "it is quite natural to apply the effective field theory approach to describe the transition  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was used to analyse the longitudinal mode in a quasi - one dimensional antiferromagnet.@xcite technically this approach is much simpler than the triplon description . the effective field theory must be written in terms of the vector field @xmath2 that describes staggered magnetization as well as the long - wave - length magnetic excitations .",
    "there is no net magnetization on both sides of the qpt , only the staggered magnetization , hence the effective landau - ginzburg lagrangian corresponding to the nonlinear @xmath3-model describes the system , @xmath4\\right)^2- \\frac{c^2}{2}\\left({\\bm \\nabla}{\\vec \\varphi}\\right)^2 -\\frac{1}{2}m^2{\\vec \\varphi}^2 -\\frac{1}{4}\\alpha[{\\vec \\varphi}^2]^2\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note the standard logic for this effective lagrangian .",
    "( i ) the elastic energy must be proportional to @xmath5 ( stiffness ) .",
    "( ii ) the system consists of spins with the same gyromagnetic ratio @xmath6 . therefore the larmor theorem must be valid : if there is a state of the system without magnetic field , then the same state in a uniform magnetic field @xmath7 must precess with frequency @xmath8 ( hereafter we set @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is bohr magneton . ) ( iii ) the static energy can depend on the magnetic field only quadratically because the system has no net magnetization .",
    "note that instead of the hard constraint , @xmath11 , usually used in the nonlinear @xmath3-model , we impose the `` soft '' quartic interaction @xmath12 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the qpt is due to the mass term , @xmath13    in tlcucl@xmath1 the qpt is driven by external hydrostatic pressure @xmath14 and this is reflected in eq.([m ] ) , @xmath15 is just a coefficient . in a more general situation pressure",
    "has to be replaced by a generalized `` coupling constant '' . when @xmath16 and there is no magnetic field , @xmath17 , the mass squared is positive and this corresponds to the magnetically disordered phase with the gapped triple degenerate spin - wave dispersion @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath19 the mass squared is negative and this results in a nonzero expectation value of @xmath20 that describes the spontaneous antiferromagnetic ordering with a gapped longitudinal mode and two gapless goldstone modes .",
    "since we will compare our results with experimental data for tlcucl@xmath1 we need to determine the corresponding spin - wave velocity @xmath22 .",
    "tlcucl@xmath1 has a monoclinic structure  @xcite with a unit cell very close to a rectangular prism with lattice parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and an angle @xmath26 only slightly deviating from a right angle ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the spin wave dispersion over the brillouin zone was determined by inelastic neutron scattering and the dispersion can be very well fit by the following formula  @xcite @xmath28 here @xmath29 , @xmath30 are dimensionless momenta .",
    "the dispersion has minimum at @xmath31 . near the minimum the dispersion squared",
    "can be expanded in powers of momentum , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and the coefficients @xmath36 are expressed in terms of parameters from ( [ js ] ) .",
    "diagonalization of the quadratic form gives the spin - wave velocities @xmath37 , @xmath38    the expansion ( [ c123 ] ) is generally valid only at small momenta , @xmath39 , however , accidentally the simple quadratic dependence along the `` softest '' direction @xmath40 is valid practically up to the boundary of the brillouine zone , @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , magnetism in tlcucl@xmath1 is three - dimensional up to the energy / temperature @xmath42 above the gap . at a higher energy / temperature",
    "the magnetism becomes two - dimensional .",

    "we chose the classical field to be directed along the z - axis in the spin space .",
    "further standard analysis of the effective lagrangian shows that there are two transverse gapless goldstone x- and y - modes @xmath52 and one gapped longitudinal z - mode with dispersion @xmath53 the `` longitudinal '' gap agrees pretty well with the data shown in fig .  [ figa ] by red triangles and diamonds .",
    "to calculate the width of the longitudinal spin wave we need to know the coefficient @xmath54 in the quartic term in ( [ lls ] ) . to determine the coefficient we turn to the analysis of bose condensation of magnons in the external magnetic field at zero pressure .",

    "( i.e. when the gap is closed ) , the energy is minimum when @xmath60 thus , there is a spontaneous staggered magnetization perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetization can be arbitrarily rotated around the direction of the magnetic field , therefore , the system retains a u(1 ) symmetry as it should be for a bose condensate .",

    "this concludes the analysis of bose condensation in terms of the effective action .",
    "it is well known that the bose condensation of magnons can be also analysed in terms of usual schrodinger equation within the hartree - fock - popov approximation .",
    "such an analysis has been performed earlier in ref . .",
    "in the hartree - fock - popov approximation the density energy of the condensate at zero temperature reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the condensate density and @xmath66 is the effective repulsion between magnons .",
