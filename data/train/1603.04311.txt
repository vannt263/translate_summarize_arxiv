    "the physical properties of layered iridates , in particular sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , have been thoroughly investigated since the seminal paper of b.  j.  kim and collaborators @xcite and their suggested analogy with the physics of cuprate superconductors .",
    "the formation of a half - filled @xmath5 doublet by the strong ir spin - orbit interaction , that is then gapped by correlations , mimics what is seen in the cuprates , making sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 an insulator , despite its ir@xmath6 ionic configuration with five occupied @xmath5 electrons @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments on doped iridates point to the emergence of a pseudogap @xcite and at low temperatures a d - wave gap @xcite , therefore strengthening the analogy with cuprates .",
    "most recently , a new experiment based on second - harmonic generation ( shg ) @xcite claimed the detection of an odd - parity , magnetic hidden order in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , suggesting the presence of orbital currents as proposed by varma for cuprates @xcite .",
    "this followed an earlier bulk property study indicating a giant magnetoelectric effect in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 @xcite .    despite these analogies , there are also significant differences between sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "first , the insulating gap has a different character , spin - orbit plus mott versus charge transfer , therefore doped holes in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 go into the ir @xmath7 states , and not in the oxygen @xmath8 ones as in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "second , the @xmath7 states of ir are much more spatially extended than the @xmath9 states of cu , making the on - site coulomb and exchange terms significantly weaker . therefore , the physical motivation for orbital currents , based as it is on the near degeneracy of the transition metal @xmath10 and oxygen @xmath11 states @xcite , seems unlikely in the iridate case , where the oxygen @xmath8 bands lie more than 3 ev below the ir @xmath5 doublet @xcite .",
    "the existence of an shg signal @xcite points to a reduction of the magnetic space group symmetry 2/m1@xmath12 previously indicated by neutrons and resonant x - ray measurements .",
    "whether this reduction is due to orbital currents or another mechanism remains to be seen . if we analyze the relative stacking along the @xmath13-axis of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) in - plane component of the moment in each of the iro@xmath0 planes , we find that three inequivalent configurations are possible . they can be labeled as @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , where @xmath14 refer to the projection of the fm component in each plane along the @xmath15-axis , with the first configuration being that identified in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 . as detailed in section iii ,",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath3 lead to a symmetry reduction of 2/m1@xmath12 and , for different reasons , can explain the shg results .",
    "the former was found by resonant x - rays in ref .   in a 0.3 t magnetic field and has also been identified by both neutrons and resonant x - rays upon doping with rh @xcite . since the inter - plane spin exchange has been estimated to be as small as 1 @xmath16ev @xcite , one could speculate that the inter - plane magnetic pattern might be disrupted by a laser pulse of 1mj/@xmath17 fluence as used in ref .  .",
    "we argue that any such pattern breaking should in general lead to an shg signal because of the resulting symmetry reduction .",
    "another possibility is that shg arises from a magnetized surface , which also has the desired symmetry . for these reasons",
    ", we believe the shg signal can in principle be explained by magnetism .    the aim of the present paper is to critically revisit several aspects of ref .",
    ", looking for alternative explanations of the shg signal , and as a byproduct address some important issues on the suppression of the resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) intensity at the ir l@xmath0 edge . to reach our goals ,",
    "the present article is organized as follows : in section ii , we review the details of the crystal and magnetic symmetries of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , and show how rxs data on rh - doped samples below @xmath18 might be explained in terms of the @xmath3 state as well as the previously suggested @xmath4 state @xcite .",
    "we propose further rxs and neutron experiments to clearly identify the actual magnetic pattern .",
    "section iii is devoted to an analysis of the shg experiment from the quantum - mechanical microscopic expressions of the tensors involved .",
    "this allows us to show that only two magnetic space groups are consistent with the shg experiment .",
    "the first is 2@xmath12/m , advocated in ref .  , which is also the magnetic space group of the @xmath3 magnetic pattern .",
    "the second is 2@xmath12/m@xmath12 , which is the magnetic group corresponding to the @xmath4 pattern .",
    "we characterize the multipole ranks of the order parameters identified by the shg experiment for each magnetic group .",
    "in particular , for the 2@xmath12/m magnetic space group of the @xmath3 state , the allowed order parameters have the symmetry of inversion - odd magnetic multipoles of rank one , two and three : toroidal dipole , magnetic quadrupole and toroidal octupole ( the magnetic quadrupole , though , does not contribute in an ss polarization geometry ) .",
    "instead , for the 2@xmath12/m@xmath12 magnetic space group of the @xmath4 state , the allowed order parameters have the symmetry of inversion - even magnetic multipoles up to rank three : magnetic toroidal monopole , magnetic dipole , magnetic toroidal quadrupole and magnetic octupole . in this section",
    ", we also speculate on whether the shg signal is induced by the laser pump , or rather that it is a surface effect ( the magnetic point group of the surface being 2@xmath12 ) .",
    "several experiments are suggested to test these possibilities . in section iv",
    ", we address the important issue of the suppression of the rxs intensity at the l@xmath0 edge and the results obtained in the literature on the doublet @xmath19 of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "we discuss some of the critical aspects of this doublet and clarify its connection to the rxs experiments .",
    "finally , in section v , ab initio simulations for some key x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) experiments are presented , with the dual goal of confirming ( or modifying ) the @xmath19 doublet picture , and also to test whether the two proposed magnetic symmetries we suggest could explain the shg experiment @xcite .",
    "some conclusions are offered in section vi .",
    "the original analysis of the crystal space group of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 suggested i4@xmath21/acd @xcite , with the 8 ir ions in this unit cell related by the symmetry operations of the 8a site of i4@xmath21/acd , as detailed in table i. for future reference , we note that , though the point symmetry of the ir site is @xmath22 , the further reduction from the 4/m point symmetry , and therefore the breaking of inversion symmetry , is determined only by the oxygens in the iro@xmath0 planes above ( below ) that of the ir , and these are quite distant ( @xmath23 6.5  ) . for this reason ,",
    "the effect of inversion - breaking at an ir site , though non - zero , is extremely small .",
    "of course , inversion symmetry in the unit cell is restored for the global symmetry i4@xmath21/acd .",
    "very recently , the crystal structure has been resolved by neutron scattering to be rather i4@xmath21/a @xcite , explaining the observation of forbidden bragg peaks in earlier experiments @xcite and in keeping with recent shg data @xcite . within this space group , the 8 ir atoms in the unit cell split into two nonequivalent groups of 4 atoms , each with the same point group @xmath22 ( sites 4a and 4b ) .",
    "the same remark concerning the inversion breaking made above still applies , as the symmetry reduction from i4@xmath21/acd to i4@xmath21/a , leading to the loss of the two glide planes containing the @xmath13-axis , is just determined by a tiny displacement of the planar oxygen atoms ( @xmath24 0.1% ) .",
    "as all the symmetry analysis in the literature up to now has been performed with the i4@xmath21/acd space group , in what follows , we shall use both the i4@xmath21/acd and i4@xmath21/a space groups , highlighting any differences between the two .      in the i4@xmath21/acd space group ( settings 2 ) ,",
    "the 8 ir atoms occupy the positions shown in table i , in fractional units ( with @xmath25=@xmath15=5.4846  , @xmath13=25.804  ) @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a surrounding distorted oxygen octahedron , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the basal ( @xmath26 ) planes , with apical oxygens along the @xmath13-axis at 2.057   and planar oxygens at 1.979  , with a tetragonal distortion of 4% @xcite .",
    "the planar oxygens are rotated by about 12@xmath27 around the @xmath13-axis : this rotation is the basis of the loss of the i4/mmm space - group symmetry that characterizes the analogous compound , ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 . below @xmath28 k @xcite , an antiferromagnetic state develops , characterized by magnetic moments lying in the basal plane and forming an angle of about 12@xmath27 with the @xmath25-axis , as shown in fig .",
    "the in - plane magnetic pattern is such as to have an antiferromagnetic order parameter along the @xmath25-axis and a ferromagnetic component along the @xmath15-axis ( smaller by the ratio @xmath29 ) , leading to the loss of tetragonal symmetry .",
    "the ferromagnetic component is however compensated when summed up over the four iro@xmath0 layers of the unit cell . in the undoped compound ,",
    "the ferromagnetic component along the @xmath15-axis has the pattern @xmath2 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .        in order to write down the resonant x - ray structure factor at the ir l@xmath30 edge ,",
    "we need to know the magnetic symmetry relations among the 8 ir atoms of the 8a site . in order to allow for comparison with previous work",
    ", we list in table i the ir atoms with the @xmath2 pattern and the symmetry operations that need to be applied to the first ir atom in order to obtain the others ( this column , for the first atom , corresponds to its point - group symmetries ) . for future convenience , we list also two other patterns of the ferromagnetic component , the @xmath4 and the @xmath3 patterns , as shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath4 structure has been identified as the magnetic structure of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 in a magnetic field ( @xmath31 t ) directed in the @xmath26-plane @xcite and also suggested as the magnetic structure in rh - doped samples @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 magnetic structure has not been suggested in the literature up to now , but we claim that it can describe some of the experimental results on rh - doped samples , as detailed below @xcite . both patterns can explain the shg experiment , as we shall see .",
    ".fractional positions in the i4@xmath21/acd crystal space group and magnetic symmetries relative to ir@xmath21 .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic moment for the @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 patterns relative to the @xmath25-axis is also given , with @xmath32 the rotation angle .",
    "note that certain operations are accompanied by glide , screw , or body - centered translations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    from table iii , we can extract the allowed tensors for 2/m1@xmath12 and each of its subgroups . for 2/m1@xmath12 , the total signal needs to be invariant under the sum over all its symmetries . if the sum is calculated for each of the above components , p@xmath33 , p@xmath34 , p@xmath35 , m@xmath33 , m@xmath34 , m@xmath35 , we get , respectively , 0 , 0 , 0 , 8@xmath36m@xmath33 , 0 , 0 .",
    "this result simply expresses the fact that no matrix element for p@xmath37 is allowed in the above group ( as a consequence of inversion symmetry that forbids matrix elements of polar vectors ) .",
    "therefore @xmath38 is zero in 2/m1@xmath12 .",
    "however , this is not the case for the imaginary part of @xmath39 , time - reversal even , because of the 8@xmath36m@xmath33 term .",
    "such a term can interfere with the @xmath40 signal .",
    "however , the only components of @xmath39 that are different from zero are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ azim ] ) , this tensor is associated with a @xmath45 azimuthal dependence , in disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "we can therefore disregard such a magnetic group and look for all possible symmetry reductions .",
    "a cautionary note is necessary : in principle , we should study the symmetry behavior of third - rank tensors with 27 cartesian components",
    ". we can simplify it and just study the sum of each line of table [ table1 ] as done above for the following reasons : a ) the square of all symmetry operations of table [ table1 ] is + 1 ; b ) the couples ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) have the same behavior and c ) the products @xmath50 and @xmath51 are always zero .",
    "putting all this together implies that studying the behavior of @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are any of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) is the same as studying @xmath58 alone and then ` add ' the non - zero @xmath59 part only to the non - zero @xmath58-terms , as in the previous case .    turning to subgroups of 2/m1@xmath12",
    ", we have 7 subgroups with 4 symmetry elements , 2/m , 2@xmath12/m , 2/m@xmath12 , 2@xmath12/m@xmath12 , 21@xmath12 , m1@xmath12 , @xmath601@xmath12 .",
    "we can repeat the above analysis for each subgroup ( keeping the order p@xmath33 , p@xmath34 , p@xmath35 , m@xmath33 , m@xmath34 , m@xmath35 ) and get :    * 2/m : the sum over the symmetry elements gives 0 , 0 , 0 , 4m@xmath33 , 0 , 0 .",
    "no @xmath38 is allowed .",
    "we have both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath39 , but again , as for the full 2/m1@xmath12 group , no odd dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , this magnetic subgroup is excluded .",
    "* 2@xmath12/m : the sum over the symmetry elements gives 0 , 4@xmath36p@xmath34 , 4@xmath36p@xmath35 , 4@xmath36m@xmath33 , 0 , 0 .",
    "this implies a signal from the time - reversal odd part of @xmath38 when an odd number of @xmath62 , @xmath63 components is considered , meaning an even number of @xmath64 components . as correctly recognized in ref .",
    ", this can explain the interference with the @xmath40 signal , being @xmath61-odd .",
    "the @xmath39 signal has the same behavior as for the 2/m1@xmath12 group , a @xmath45-azimuthal dependence .",
    "therefore it is not responsible for the signal .",
    "we remark that this magnetic symmetry is the one of the @xmath3 pattern studied in the previous section .",
    "we shall analyze this case more below .",
    "* 2/m@xmath12 : the sum over the symmetry elements gives 4@xmath36p@xmath33 , 0 , 0 , 4@xmath36m@xmath33 , 0 , 0 .",

    "no @xmath38 is allowed and the imaginary , time - reversal even @xmath39 tensor has no odd-@xmath61 terms .",
    "however , the real , time - reversal odd @xmath39 tensor has the desired odd-@xmath61 terms ( e.g. , @xmath66 ) and it can interfere with the imaginary part of @xmath40 ( through the damping factor @xmath67 ) .",
    "its order parameter is either a magnetic dipole or a magnetic octupole .",
    "interestingly , this magnetic group corresponds to the @xmath4 state .",
    "it is further discussed below . * m1@xmath12 : the sum over the symmetry elements gives 0 , 4@xmath65p@xmath34 , 4@xmath65p@xmath35 , 4@xmath36m@xmath33 , 0 , 0 .",
    "the imaginary , time - reversal even @xmath39 tensor does not have odd-@xmath61 terms , because of the odd number of @xmath64 components and does not contribute to the signal . an odd-@xmath61 dependence for @xmath38",
    "is possible ( even number of @xmath64 components ) , but only for its real , time - reversal even part .",
    "again , the real part of @xmath38 can interfere with the imaginary part of @xmath40 because of the damping factor @xmath67 .",
    "the order parameter associated with this magnetic group has the symmetry of a time - reversal even electric polarization ( or octupole ) .",
    "on the basis of the experimental evidence , it appears as highly implausible that it determines the shg signal because such an order parameter implies the displacement of atoms , so as to break the global inversion , and this would be detectable by other means .",
    "moreover , the order parameter is time - reversal even and should have contributed also in the high - temperature phase , as no crystal distortion is detected in passing from the high - temperature phase to the low - temperature , magnetic phase .",
    "this is against the experimental evidence .",
    "* 21@xmath12 : the sum over the symmetry elements gives 4@xmath65p@xmath33 , 0 , 0 , 4@xmath36m@xmath33 , 0 , 0 . as for the 2/m@xmath12 group , both @xmath38 ( real part , time - reversal even ) and @xmath39 can contribute , but none have the correct odd-@xmath61 dependence .",

    "no @xmath38 is allowed . the imaginary",
    ", time - reversal even @xmath39 tensor is allowed with an even number of @xmath64 components and can have the right odd-@xmath61 dependence .",
    "it can interfere with the imaginary part of @xmath40 , but , as for the m1@xmath12 group , it seems implausible since its associated order parameter is time - reversal even ( symmetry of an axial toroidal dipole or of an electric quadrupole ) : either it should have been different from zero also in the high - temperature , tetragonal phase , against the experimental evidence , or it should be a secondary order - parameter , induced by the ordered magnetic moments . in the latter case , however , magnetic moments should break the @xmath68 symmetry by tilting along the @xmath13-axis , against the experimental evidence as well .",
    "in this appendix , we list our own definitions for the atomic - like ground state of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , highlighting the differences with other authors when needed .",
    "notice that the method that maps @xmath5 orbitals to effective @xmath11 orbitals with angular momentum @xmath69 is conceived to work within the @xmath5 subspace , so care must be taken when generalizing to transition matrix elements involving other subspaces , as in the case of the l@xmath0 and l@xmath30 edges .",
    "as our main objective is to write down the l@xmath70-edge cross - section , we shall not work with the effective angular momentum , but with the real ones .",
    "below , we give the formulas to pass from one representation to the other , in order to compare with the existing literature .                              given its importance in the analysis of the l@xmath0 and l@xmath30 edges of ir , we write down also the @xmath82 and @xmath83 states of the @xmath7 electrons in terms of spherical harmonics and spin functions ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) :                    @xmath95 it should be reminded that a direct transition from the l@xmath0 edge , characterized by @xmath96 , to the @xmath97 subspace is dipole forbidden . therefore the decomposition of the half - filled kramers doublet of ir in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 as @xmath97 states will directly inform us about whether this transition is allowed or not at the l@xmath0 edge . in order to do this ,",
    "we write down the inverse formulas to get @xmath98 states as a function of @xmath99 :      these expressions can be directly related to the ` cartesian ' states ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , etc . ) through the relations given above . however , it is more convenient to keep them in this form and rather to express the kramers doublet ( eq .  ( [ kramers ] ) ) in the spherical basis @xmath98 , as detailed below .",
    "it should be noted in passing that fig .",
    "1(e ) of ref .",
    "is somewhat misleading in one aspect : the @xmath103 atomic ( spherical ) states do not branch just to the @xmath5 ones in an octahedral environment ( called @xmath104 in that figure ) , but to both @xmath5 and @xmath105 .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath97 states .",
    "however , it is true that the kramers doublet in an octahedral crystal field ( i.e. , @xmath19 , in the absence of a tetragonal distortion ) , is entirely due to the @xmath97 states , as we shall see below .",
    "this is expressed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "as done in a number of publications on iridates @xcite , and as detailed in abragam and bleaney @xcite , the ir@xmath6 state when restricted to the @xmath5 subspace , and in the presence of a weak tetragonal crystal field in the @xmath64 direction , can be determined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath106    here @xmath107 is the spin - orbit coupling and @xmath108 represents the tetragonal distortion .",
    "but , to facilitate calculations at the l@xmath0 and l@xmath30 edges , we consider this hamiltonian in the @xmath109 basis instead of the @xmath69 basis .",
    "for comparison with earlier work , we report below the relation between the two bases .",

    "@xmath149 is a normalization constant ( not important for the following , as it can be absorbed into the radial part , @xmath150 ) .",
    "having all the coefficients , the transition matrix elements are now easily calculated after noting that the spin is not changed in the transition ( so , only equal - spin states are coupled during the x - ray excitation ) , and given the expressions for the only two gaunt coefficients that appear in the calculation :          where @xmath153 represents the clebsch - gordan coefficient for the vector sum of @xmath154 and @xmath155 to give @xmath156 .",

    "( [ kramers2b ] ) , we get that in the octahedral limit , @xmath127 , all the matrix elements at the l@xmath0 edge are zero , not just the magnetic ones . in particular , the xas signal should be zero in this limit . therefore ,",
    "if an xas signal is confirmed at the energy of this edge , this would show that @xmath172 deviates from @xmath173 , as discussed in section iv .",
    "notice however that , differently from magnetic rxs , xas can also see the other empty states that are higher in energy , in particular the @xmath105 states , that are accessible from the l@xmath0 edge because they have a sizable component in the @xmath83 subspace as seen above .",
    "therefore , the xas signal should be reanalyzed with a better energy sensitivity , so as to clearly disentangle the unoccupied @xmath5 states from the @xmath105 ones , as discussed in section v. if such a signal is clearly detected at the edge itself , this is a definitive proof that the half - filled kramers doublet deviates significantly from the octahedral limit .",
    "if such a signal is not detected , to the contrary , this is clear proof that the doublet is composed purely of @xmath82 states , as is the case of @xmath174 above ( eq .  ( [ psirealj ] ) ) in the octahedral limit ( @xmath127 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "this also implies the absence of a signal in the magnetic rxs at the l@xmath0 edge . in the former case , instead ,",
    "absence of the magnetic signal at the l@xmath0 edge can also be explained by an in - plane magnetic moment , that makes @xmath175 , since the magnetic signal originates from the off - diagonal matrix element , @xmath176 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this latter case would not permit one to explain the lack of a rxs signal that is also seen when the magnetic moment is along @xmath13 , as in mn - doped @xcite and ru - doped @xcite samples .",
