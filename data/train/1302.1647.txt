    "the mission has revolutionized exoplanet statistics by increasing the number of known extrasolar planets and planet candidates by a factor of five and discovering systems with longer orbital periods and smaller planet radii than prior exoplanet surveys @xcite .",
    "is a discovery - class space - based mission designed to detect transiting exoplanets by monitoring the brightness of over 100,000  stars @xcite .",
    "the majority of s target stars are solar - like @xmath7 dwarfs and accordingly most of the work on the planet occurrence rate from has been focused on planets orbiting that sample of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "those studies revealed that the planet occurrence rate increases toward smaller planet radii and longer orbital periods .",
    "@xcite also found evidence for an increasing planet occurrence rate with decreasing stellar effective temperature , but the trend was not significant below 5100k .",
    "@xcite conducted their analysis using the 1235  planet candidates presented in @xcite .",
    "the subsequent list of candidates published in february  2012 @xcite includes an additional 1091  planet candidates and provides a better sample for estimating the occurrence rate .",
    "the new candidates are primarily small objects ( 196 with @xmath8 , 416 with @xmath9 , and 421 with @xmath10 ) , but the list also includes 41 larger candidates with radii @xmath11 . the inclusion of larger candidates in the @xcite sample is an indication that the original @xcite list was not complete at large planet radii and that continued improvements to the detection algorithm may result in further announcements of planet candidates with a range of radii and orbital periods .",
    "in addition to nearly doubling the number of planet candidates , @xcite also improved the stellar parameters for many target stars by comparing the estimated temperatures , radii , and surface gravities in the input catalog ( kic ; @xcite ) to the values expected from yonsei - yale evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "rather than refer back to the original photometry , @xcite adopted the stellar parameters of the closest yonsei - yale model to the original kic values in the three - dimensional space of temperature , radius , and surface gravity .",
    "this approach did not correctly characterize the coolest target stars because the starting points were too far removed from the actual temperatures , radii , and surface gravities of the stars .",
    "in addition , the yonsei - yale models overestimate the observed radii and luminosity of cool stars at a given effective temperature @xcite .",
    "although early work @xcite suggested that a hypothetical planet in the habitable zone ( the range of distances at which liquid water could exist on the surface of the planet ) of an m  dwarf would be inhospitable because the planet would be tidally - locked and the atmosphere would freeze out on the dark side of the planet , more recent studies have been more optimistic . for instance , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide could prevent the atmosphere from freezing .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported that a tidally - locked planet could be in a partially habitable `` eyeball earth '' state in which the planet is mostly frozen but has a liquid water ocean at the substellar point .",
    "moreover , planets orbiting m  dwarfs might become trapped in spin - orbit resonances like mercury instead of becoming spin - synchronized .",
    "a second concern for the habitability of planets orbiting m  dwarfs is the possibility of strong flares and high uv emission in quiescence @xcite .",
    "although a planet without a magnetic field could require years to rebuild its ozone layer after experiencing strong flare , the majority of the uv flux would never reach the surface of the planet .",
    "accordingly , flares do not present a significant obstacle to the habitability of planets orbiting m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the specific role of uv radiation in the evolution of life on earth is uncertain .",
    "a baseline level of uv flux might be necessary to spur biogenesis @xcite , yet uv radiation is also capable of destroying biomolecules .",
    "having established that planets in the habitable zones of m  dwarfs could be habitable despite the initial concern of the potential hazards of tidal - locking and stellar flares , the motivation for studying the coolest target stars is three - fold .",
    "first , several more years of observations will be required to detect earth - size planets in the habitable zones of g  dwarfs due to the higher - than - expected photometric noise due to stellar variability @xcite , but is already sensitive to the presence of earth - size planets in the habitable zones of m  dwarfs .",
    "although a transiting planet in the habitable zone of a g star transits only once per year , a transiting planet in the habitable zone of a 3800k m  star transits five times per year . additionally , the geometric probability that a planet in the habitable zone transits the star is 1.8 times greater .",
    "furthermore , the transit signal of an earth - size planet orbiting a 3800k m  star is 3.3  times deeper than the transit of an earth - size planet across a g star because the star is 45% smaller than the sun .",
    "the combination of a shorter orbital period , an increased transit probability , and a deeper transit depth greatly reduces the difficulty of detecting a habitable planet and has motivated numerous planet surveys to target m  dwarfs @xcite .",
    "second , as predicted by @xcite and @xcite , studies of the solar neighborhood have revealed that m  dwarfs are twelve times more abundant than g  dwarfs .",
    "the abundance of m  dwarfs , combined with growing evidence for an increase in the planet occurrence rate at decreasing stellar temperatures @xcite , implies that the majority of small planets may be located around the coolest stars .",
    "although m  dwarfs are intrinsically fainter than solar - type stars , 75% percent of the stars within 10  pc are m  dwarfs @xcite . these stars would be among the best targets for future spectroscopic investigations of potentially - habitable rocky planets due to the small radii and apparent brightness of the stars .",
    "third , confirming the planetary nature and measuring the mass of an earth - size planet orbiting within the habitable zone of an m  dwarf is easier than confirming and measuring the mass of an earth - size planet orbiting within the habitable zone of a g  dwarf .",
    "the radial velocity signal induced by a @xmath12 planet in the middle of the habitable zone ( @xmath13au ) of a 3800k , @xmath14 m  dwarf is @xmath15  cm / s . in comparison ,",
    "the rv signal caused by a @xmath12 planet in the habitable zone of a g  dwarf is 9  cm / s .",
    "the prospects for rv  confirmation are even better for planets around mid - to - late m  dwarfs : an earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a 3200k m  dwarf would produce an rv signal of @xmath16  m / s , which is achievable with the current precision of modern spectrographs @xcite .",
    "prior to investing a significant amount of resources in investigations of the atmosphere of a potentially habitable planet , it would be wise to first guarantee that the candidate object is indeed a high - density planet and not a low - density mini - neptune .",
    "finally , upcoming facilities such as jwst and gmt will have the capability to take spectra of earth - size planets in the habitable zones of m  dwarfs , but not earth - size planets in the habitable zones of more massive stars . in order to find a sample of habitable zone earth - size planets for which astronomers could measure atmospheric properties with the next generation of telescopes , astronomers need to look for planets around small dwarfs .      in light of the advantages of searching for habitable planets around small stars ,",
    "several authors have worked on refining the parameters of the smallest target stars .",
    "@xcite collected medium - resolution , @xmath17-band spectra of the cool planet candidate host stars listed in @xcite and presented revised stellar parameters for those host stars .",
    "their sample included 69  host stars with kic  temperatures below 4400k as well as an additional 13  host stars with higher kic temperatures but with red colors that hint that their kic  temperatures were overestimated .",
    "@xcite determined effective temperature and metallicity directly from their spectra using the h@xmath18o - k2 index @xcite and then constrain stellar radii and masses using dartmouth stellar evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "we adopt the same set of stellar models in this paper .",
    "@xcite found that one of the 82 targets ( kepler object of interest ( koi )  977 ) is a giant star and that three small kois  ( 463.01 , 812.03 , 854.01 ) lie within the habitable zone .",
    "@xcite announced the discovery of koi  254.01 , the first short - period gas giant orbiting an m  dwarf .",
    "the planet has a radius of @xmath19 and orbits its host star kic  5794240 once every 2.455239  days .",
    "in addition to discussing koi  254.01 , @xcite also calibrated a relation for determining the masses and metallicities of m  dwarfs from broad - band photometry .",
    "they found that @xmath20 color is a reasonable ( @xmath21  dex ) indicator of metallicity for stars with metallicities between @xmath22 and 0.5  dex and @xmath20 colors within 0.1  magnitudes of the main sequence @xmath20 at the @xmath23 color of the star in question .",
    "the relationship between infrared colors and metallicities was first proposed by @xcite and subsequently confirmed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite took the first steps toward a global reanalysis of the cool target stars .",
    "they acquired medium - resolution , visible spectra of 382  target stars and classified all of the cool stars in the target list as dwarfs or giants using `` training sets '' constructed from their spectra and literature spectra .",
    "@xcite found that the majority of bright , cool target stars are giants in disguise and that the temperatures of the cool dwarf stars are systematically overestimated by 110  k in the kic .",
    "@xcite reported that correctly classifying and removing giant stars removes the correlation between cool star metallicity and planet occurrence observed by @xcite .",
    "after removing giant stars from the target list , @xcite calculated a planet occurrence rate of @xmath24 planets per cool star with radii between 2 and 32  @xmath25 and orbital periods less than 50  days .",
    "their result is higher than the occurrence rate we report in section  [ ssec : occrp ] , most likely because of our revisions to the stellar radii .    in this paper , we characterize the coolest target stars by revisiting the approach used to create the input catalog @xcite and tailoring that method for application to cool stars . specifically , we extract @xmath26 photometry from the kic for the 51813 planet search target stars with kic  temperature estimates @xmath27k and for the 13402  planet search target stars without kic temperature estimates and compare the observed colors to the colors of model stars from the dartmouth stellar evolutionary database @xcite .",
    "we discuss the features of the dartmouth stellar models in section  [ ssec : dartmouth ] and explain our procedure for assigning revised stellar parameters in section  [ ssec : assignments ] .",
    "we present revised stellar characterizations in section [ sec : stars ] and improved planetary parameters for the associated planet candidates in section [ sec : planets ] .",
    "we address the implications of these results on the planet occurrence rate in section [ sec : occ ] and conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the dartmouth models incorporate both an internal stellar structure code and a model atmosphere code . unlike the atlas9 models @xcite used in development of the input catalog , the dartmouth models perform well for low - mass stars because the package uses phoenix atmospheres to model stars cooler than 10,000k .",
    "the phoenix models include low - temperature chemistry and are therefore well - suited for use with low - mass dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the dartmouth models include evolutionary tracks and isochrones for a range of stellar parameters .",
    "the tracks and isochrones are available electronically and provide the mass , luminosity , temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , helium fraction , and @xmath28-element enrichment at each evolutionary time step .",
    "we consider the full range of dartmouth model metallicities ( @xmath29\\leq0.5)$ ] , but we restrict our set of models to stars with solar @xmath28-element enhancement , masses below @xmath30 , and temperatures below 7000k .",
    "we exclude models of more massive stars because solar - like stars are well - fit by the atlas9 models used in the construction of the kic and it is unlikely that a star as massive as the sun would have been assigned a temperature lower than our selection cut @xmath31k .",
    "the dartmouth team supplies synthetic photometry for a range of photometric systems by integrating the spectrum of each star over the relevant bandpass .",
    "we downloaded the synthetic photometry for the 2mass and sloan digital sky survey systems ( sdss ) and used relations  14 from @xcite to convert the observed kic magnitudes for each target star to the equivalent magnitudes in the sdss system . for cool stars , the correction due to the filter differences is typically much smaller than the assumed errors in the photometry ( 0.01 mag in @xmath32 and 0.03 mag in @xmath33 , similar to the assumptions in @xcite ) .",
    "all stars have full 2mass photometry , but @xmath34 of the target stars are missing photometry in one or more visible kic bands . for those stars ,",
    "we correct for the linear offset in all bands and apply the median correction found for the whole sample of stars for the color - dependent term . in our final cool dwarf sample , 70  stars lack @xmath35-band photometry and 29  stars lack @xmath36-band .",
    "we exclude all stars with more than one missing band .",
    "our final sample of model stars is drawn from a set of isochrones with ages 113  gyr and spans a temperature range 27086998k .",
    "the stars have masses 0.011.00@xmath37 , radii 0.102223@xmath38 , and metallicities @xmath39  [ fe / h ]  @xmath40 .",
    "all model stars have solar @xmath28/fe  ratios .",
    "there is a deficit of dartmouth model stars with radii @xmath41 ; we cope with this gap by fitting polynomials to the relationships between temperature , radius , mass , luminosity , and colors at fixed age and metallicity .",
    "we then interpolate those relationships over a grid with uniform ( @xmath42 ) spacing between 0.17@xmath38 and 0.8@xmath38 to derive the parameters for stars that would have fallen in the gap in the original model grid .",
    "we compute the surface gravities for the resulting interpolated models from their masses and radii .",
    "when fitting stars , we use the original grid of model stars supplemented by the interpolated models .",
    "our fitted parameters may be unreliable for stars younger than 0.5  gyr because those stars are still undergoing kelvin - helmholtz contraction .",
    "we specifically include giant stars in our model set so that we have the capability to identify red giants that have been misclassified as red dwarfs ( and vice versa ) .",
    "@xcite discovered one such masquerading giant ( koi  977 ) in their spectroscopic analysis of the cool planet candidate host stars and @xcite have argued that giant stars comprise @xmath43 of the population of bright ( kepmag  @xmath44  14 ) and @xmath45 of the population of dim ( kepmag  @xmath46  14 ) cool target stars .",
    "we are confident in the ability of our photometric analysis to correctly identify the luminosity class of cool stars because the infrared colors of dwarfs and giant stars are well - separated at low temperatures .",
    "for instance , our photometric analysis classifies koi  977 ( kic  11192141 ) as a cool giant with an effective temperature of @xmath47k , radius @xmath48 , luminosity @xmath49 , and surface gravity @xmath50 .",
    "the reported mass ( @xmath51 ) is near the edge of our model grid , so refitting the star with a more massive model grid may yield different results for the stellar parameters .",
    "we assign revised stellar parameters by comparing the observed optical and near infrared colors of all 51813  cool ( @xmath31k ) and all 13402  unclassified planet search target stars to the colors of model stars .",
    "we account for interstellar reddening by determining the distance at which the apparent @xmath52-band magnitude of the model star would match the observed apparent @xmath52-band magnitude of each target star .",
    "we then apply a band - dependent correction assuming 1 magnitude of extinction per 1000  pc in @xmath53-band in the plane of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we find the best - fit model for each target star by computing the difference in the colors of a given target star and all of the model stars .",
    "we then scale the differences by the photometric errors in each band and add them in quadrature to determine the @xmath54 for a match to each model star .    as explained in section  [ sssec : priors ] , we incorporate priors on the stellar metallicity and the height of stars above the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we rescale the errors so that the minimum @xmath54 is equal to the number of colors ( generally 6 ) minus the number of fitted parameters ( 3 for radius , temperature , and metallicity ) .",
    "we then adopt the stellar parameters corresponding to the best - fit model and set the error bars to encompass the parameters of all model stars falling within the @xmath55 confidence interval .",
    "for example , for koi  2626 ( kid  11768142 ) , we find @xmath55 confidence intervals @xmath56 , @xmath57k , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath58 . we find a best - fit mass @xmath59 and luminosity @xmath60 , resulting in a distance estimate of @xmath61  pc .",
    "the corresponding surface gravity is therefore @xmath62 .",
    "we find that fitting the target stars without assuming prior knowledge of the metallicity distribution leads to an overabundance of low - metallicity stars , so we adopt priors on the underlying distributions of metallicity and height above the plane .",
    "we then determine the best - fit model by minimizing the equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total color difference between a target star and model star @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the probability that a star has the metallicity of model star @xmath65 , and @xmath67 is the probability that a star would be found at the height at which model star @xmath65 would have the same apparent @xmath52-band magnitude as the target star .",
    "we weight the priors so that each prior has the same weight as a single color .",
    "we set the metallicity prior by assuming that the metallicity distribution of the m  dwarfs in the target list is similar to the metallicity distribution of the 343  nearby m  dwarfs studied by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we produce a histogram of the logarithm of the number of stars in each logarithmic metallicity bin and then fit a polynomial to the distribution .",
    "we extrapolate the polynomial down to [ fe / h ]  @xmath68 and up to [ fe / h ]  @xmath69 to cover the full range of allowed stellar models .",
    "our final metallicity prior and the histogram of m  dwarf metallicities from @xcite are shown in figure [ fig : metpoly ] .",
    "the distribution peaks at [ fe / h]@xmath70 and has a long tail extending down toward lower metallicities .",
    "we adopt the same height prior as @xcite : the number of stars falls off exponentially with increasing height above the plane of the galaxy and the scale height of the disk is 300  pc @xcite .",
    "our photometric distance estimates for 77% of our cool dwarfs are within 300  pc , so adopting this prior has little effect on the chosen stellar parameters and the resulting planet occurrence rate .",
    "our procedure for estimating stellar parameters expressly considers the covariance between fitted parameters by simultaneously determining the likelihood of each of the models and determining the range of temperatures , metallicities , and radii that would encompass the full 68.3% confidence interval .",
    "the provided error bars therefore account for the fact that high - metallicity warm m  dwarfs and low - metallicity cool m  dwarfs have similar colors .",
    "we confirm that the quoted errors on the stellar parameters are large enough to account for the errors in the photometry by conducting a perturbation analysis in which we create 100  copies of each of the m  dwarfs and add gaussian distributed noise to the photometry based on the reported uncertainty in each band .",
    "we then run our stellar parameter determination pipeline and compare the distribution of best - fit parameters for each star to our original estimates .",
    "we find that there is a correlation between higher temperatures and higher metallicities , but that our reported error bars are larger than the standard deviation of the best - fit parameters .",
    "we confirm that we are able to recover accurate parameters for low mass stars from photometry by running our stellar parameter determination pipeline on a sample of stars with known distances .",
    "we obtained a list of 438  m  dwarfs with measured parallaxes , @xmath71 photometry from 2mass , and @xmath72 photometry from the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ) from jonathan irwin ( personal communication , january 2 , 2013 ) and performed a series of quality cuts on the sample .",
    "we removed stars with parallax errors above 5% and and stars with fewer than two measurements in the apass database .",
    "we then visually inspected the 2mass photometry of the remaining 230  stars to ensure that none of them belonged to multiple systems that could have been unresolved in apass and resolved in 2mass .",
    "we removed 203  stars with other stars or quasars within 1 , resulting in a final sample of 26  stars .",
    "we estimate the masses of the 26  stars by running our stellar parameter determination pipeline to match the observed colors to the colors of dartmouth model stars .",
    "the apass @xmath72 photometry was acquired using filters matching the original sdss @xmath72 bands ; we convert the apass photometry to the unprimed sdss 2.5 m @xmath32 bands using the transformation equations provided on the sdss photometry white paper .",
    "we then compare the masses assigned by our pipeline to the masses predicted from the empirical relation between mass and absolute @xmath73 magnitude @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : delfosse ] , our mass estimates are consistent with the mass predicted by the delfosse relation .",
    "the masses predicted by the pipeline are typically @xmath74 lower than the mass predicted by the delfosse relation , but none of these stars have reported @xmath36-band photometry whereas 96% of our final sample of m  dwarfs have full @xmath26 photometry .",
    "accordingly , we do not fit for a correction term because the uncertainty introduced by adding a scaling term based on fits made to stars with only five colors would be comparable to the offset between our predicted masses and the masses predicted by the delfosse relation .",
    "our final sample of cool target stars includes stars with temperatures below 4000k and surface gravities above @xmath75 .",
    "the sample consists primarily of late - k and early - m dwarfs , but 201  stars have revised temperatures between @xmath76k .",
    "the revised parameters for all of the cool dwarfs are provided in the appendix in table  [ tab : stubcoolstars ] .",
    "we exclude stars from the final sample because their photometry is consistent with classification as evolved stars ( @xmath77 ) and stars because their photometry is insufficient to discriminate between dwarf and giant models .",
    "we refer to the stars that could be fit by either dwarf or giant models as `` ambiguous '' stars .",
    "the majority ( 80% ) of the stars classified as `` ambiguous '' were not assigned temperatures in the kic .",
    "we find that @xmath78% of cool bright ( @xmath79k , kepmag  @xmath80 ) stars and @xmath81% of cool faint ( @xmath79k , kepmag  @xmath82 ) stars are giants , which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "( the precise fractions of giant stars depend on whether the ambiguous stars are counted as giant stars . )",
    "one of the excluded ambiguous stars is kid  8561063 ( koi  961 ) , which was confirmed by @xcite as a @xmath83 , @xmath84k star hosting sub - earth - size three planet candidates .",
    "the kic does not include @xmath36-band photometry for koi  961 and we were unable to rule out matches with giant stars using only @xmath85 photometry .",
    "the distributions of temperature , radius , metallicity , and surface gravity for the stars in our sample are shown in figure [ fig : stellarfits ] .",
    "for comparison , we display both fits made without using priors ( left panels ) and fits including priors on the stellar metallicity distribution and the height of stars above the plane of the galaxy ( right panels ) . in both cases",
    "the radii of the majority of stars are significantly smaller than the values given in the kic and the surface gravities are much higher . as discussed in section  [ sssec : priors ] , the primary difference between the two model fits is that setting a prior on the underlying metallicity distribution reduces the number of stars with revised metallicities below [ fe / h]@xmath86 . since such stars should be relatively uncommon , we choose to adopt the stellar parameters given by fitting the stars assuming priors on metallicity and height above the plane .    incorporating priors , the median temperature of a star in the sample is 3723k and the median radius is @xmath87 .",
    "most of the stars in the sample are slightly less metal - rich than the sun ( median [ fe / h]=@xmath88 ) , but 21% have metallicities @xmath89[fe / h]@xmath90 .",
    "although nearly all of the stars in the sample ( 96% ) had kic surface gravities below @xmath91 , our reanalysis indicates that 95% actually have surface gravities above @xmath92 . as shown by the purple histograms in each of the panels",

    "the spread in the radii of the model points at a given temperature is due to the range of metallicities allowed in the model suite . at a given temperature , the majority of the original radii from the kic lie above the model grid in a region of radius  temperature space unoccupied by low - mass stars .",
    "the discrepancy between the model radii and the kic radii is partially due to the errors in the assumed surface gravities .",
