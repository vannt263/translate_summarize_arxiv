    "originating mainly from high redshift , cmb observables provide few direct constraints on the dark energy .",
    "nonetheless , their indirect impact on other more local dark energy probes is important to bear in mind when planning future studies .",
    "cmb observables provide two things for dark energy probes : internally or self - calibrated standard rulers and fluctuations for distance and growth rate probes and an expansion history for the universe that is fixed as a function of redshift beyond the current acceleration regime .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : parameterization ] by reviewing the dark energy observables themselves . in  [ sec : cmb ] , we discuss the calibration of the cmb standards and the means by which their self - consistency may be checked .",
    "we illustrate these considerations with the recombination calculation .",
    "although the state - of - the - art in recombination is sufficient compared to current measurement errors , it will introduce substantial systematic errors for experiments that are cosmic variance limited out to multipoles of @xmath2 like planck .",
    "errors in the assumed recombination , including exotica such as a variation in the fine structure constant , would appear as an inconsistency in the damping tail . accepting the standard thermal history the expansion history",
    "is fixed in the deceleration regime . in ",
    "[ sec : deviations ] we explore the implications for dark energy probes . in light of the cmb , the focus returns to low redshift dark energy observables and accurate local calibration . in  [ sec : forecasts ] , we consider several optically based probes of the dark energy in light of the cmb .",
    "on scales well below current horizon or hubble distance where the dark energy can be taken to be smooth , all of its observable effects come through the evolution of its average density @xmath3 as a function of scale factor @xmath4 .",
    "this evolution in turn is related by energy conservation @xmath5 to its current energy density @xmath6 relative to critical @xmath7 and its equation of state @xmath8 hereafter when an argument to @xmath6 and @xmath9 is unspecified , @xmath10 is to be understood .",
    "we employ throughout units where @xmath11 .",
    "the two basic dark - energy dependent observables are distance and growth rate .",
    "distance measures are based on having standardized candles , rulers , or object number densities as a function of redshift ; growth rate measures are based on standard density fluctuations in linear theory either calibrated today or at the initial conditions and then observed at different redshifts .",
    "all distance measures are ultimately based on the comoving distance to redshift @xmath12 @xmath13 for example , the physical angular diameter distance and luminosity distance are related to the comoving angular diameter distance @xmath14 by multiplying and dividing by @xmath15 respectively .",
    "here @xmath16 is the radius of curvature in an open or closed geometry and @xmath17 is the total energy density relative to critical . for comoving distances much smaller than the curvature scale @xmath18 .",
    "the comoving volume element employed in number density tests is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the solid angle .",
    "if the absolute brightness or physical scale of the standards is unknown then a @xmath21 vs @xmath12 comparison will yield the distance ratio @xmath22 i.e. a distance measured in units of @xmath23 mpc .",
    "this distinction differentiates ( absolute ) cmb calibration standards from ( relative ) local standards .",
    "likewise , if the standard ruler is employed in the radial or redshift direction , it measures @xmath24 if absolutely calibrated and @xmath25 if relatively calibrated .",
    "finally the ruler need not even be standard in redshift if its angular and radial extent are compared at the same redshift ( @xcite 1979 ) . in this case",

    "a completely empirical description of the dark energy would require that observations constrain a free function @xmath39 .",
    "however , the dark energy will typically only have observable effects during the recent few e - foldings when it contributes substantially to the expansion rate . during this short period in the expansion history ,",
    "the equation of state function can be usefully approximated through a linear expansion around a normalization epoch @xmath40 through the local slope @xmath41 as @xmath42 as pointed out by @xcite ( 2003 ) , this expansion is more stable to extrapolation away from @xmath40 than the analogous linearization in redshift .",
    "a common choice for the normalization point in the literature is the present epoch @xmath43 . in this case , let us define the amplitude @xmath44 , the equation of state parameter today . while we follow this convention here , it is well known that this choice will cause a degeneracy between the amplitude @xmath45 and evolution @xmath46 of @xmath39 for typical observables .",
    "thus when marginalized over @xmath47 , the parameter @xmath48 will have large errors .",
    "large errors does _ not _ mean that that the equation of state parameter is nowhere well - determined , it simply means that given the possibility of evolution its _ current _ value is not well determined .",
    "note that a measurement of @xmath49 at _ any _ redshift would rule out a cosmological constant as the dark energy .",
    "a given set of phenomena will best constrain @xmath50 at the redshifts relevant to the phenomena .",
    "it would thus be better to place @xmath51 near the expected epoch of dark energy domination .",
    "this situation is completely analogous to choosing a scale for the normalization of the power spectrum , e.g. one would not quote a cobe - style horizon scale normalization at @xmath52 for the wmap data but a much smaller scale of @xmath53 mpc@xmath54 corresponding to the scale of the acoustic peak measurements [ see eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : initialpower ] ) ] .    as with the power spectrum normalization ,",
    "an inappropriate choice for the dark energy normalization point can be corrected after the fact _ if _ the covariance matrix of the parameters is also given .",

    "best \" choice for a given observation ( @xcite 1999b ; @xcite 2003 ) @xmath58 such that the errors on @xmath59 and @xmath47 are uncorrelated .",
    "furthermore the errors on @xmath59 are the same as that on @xmath48 with the evolution @xmath47 fixed by a prior . to avoid confusion however",
    ", we will refer to constraints in the context of a constant @xmath50 as being on the quantity @xmath60 the distinction between @xmath59 and @xmath61 arises when considering multidimensional constraints .",
    "for example in the 2d ( @xmath6,@xmath61 ) plane , errors in the @xmath6 direction increase due to marginalization over @xmath47 .",
    "cmb standards for the dark energy are particularly useful in that they are internally or self - calibrated . equally importantly ,",
    "the physical processes governing these standards are sufficiently simple that there are only a few assumptions going into the calibration .",
    "these assumptions can themselves be tested through internal consistency checks .",
    "these standards are mainly based on the acoustic features in the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies .",
    "these features are frozen in place at recombination . the theoretical accuracy to which we can calibrate these standards is limited by the accuracy to which recombination has been calculated .",
    "the accuracy of cmb anisotropy calculations are limited not by that of the radiative transfer or the general relativistic description but ironically by that of the recombination calculation .",
    "this status has been true at least since the development of the modern einstein - boltzmann codes in the mid 1980 s when radiative transfer improvements began to outpace recombination improvements .",
    "the currently claimed @xmath62 precision of numerical codes ( @xcite 2003 ) is just that : a statement of precision .",
    "the accuracy of the standard recombination calculation has only been certified to the @xmath63 level .",
    "the current standard for calculating the ionization history is recfast ( @xcite 1999 ) which employs the traditional two - level atom calculation of @xcite ( 1968 ) but alters the hydrogen case @xmath64 recombination rate @xmath65 to fit the results of a multilevel atom .",
    "more specifically , recfast solves a coupled system of equations for the ionization fraction @xmath66 in singly ionized hydrogen and helium ( @xmath67 h , he ) @xmath68\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the total hydrogen number density accounting for the helium mass fraction @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the total ionization fraction , @xmath72 is the free electron density , @xmath73 is the maximum @xmath66 achieved through full ionization , @xmath74 with @xmath75 the ratio of statistical weights , @xmath76 the baryon temperature , @xmath77 the binding energy of the @xmath78th level , @xmath79 the rate of redshifting out of the lyman-@xmath80 line corrected for the energy difference between the @xmath81 and @xmath82 states @xmath83 and @xmath84 as the rate for the 2 photon @xmath85 transition . for reference , for hydrogen @xmath86ev , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 . for helium @xmath91ev , @xmath92ev , @xmath93ev , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 $ ] .    if @xmath97 , the @xmath66 reaches the saha equilibrium , @xmath98 or @xmath99 \\\\     & = & x_{\\rm max } \\left [   1 - { x_{ei } + x_{\\rm max }   \\over s } \\left (   1 - { x_{ei } + 2 x_{\\rm max } \\over s } \\right )      + ... \\right]\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the ionization fraction excluding the species .",
    "this solution is used in place of the integration until say @xmath101 .",

    "the case @xmath64 recombination coefficients as a function of @xmath76 are given in @xcite ( 1999 ) as is the strong thermal coupling between @xmath76 and @xmath104 .",
    "the multilevel - atom fudge that recfast introduces is to replace the hydrogen @xmath105 independently of cosmology .",
    "while this fudge suffices for the current observations , the recombination standard will require improvement if cmb anisotropy constraints are to reach their full potential .",
    "to estimate at what point the recombination calculation will need to be improved we can compare the sensitivity of the spectra to the @xmath65 fudge to cosmic variance errors .",
    "[ fig : recombination ] shows that at @xmath106 a calibration to the multilevel atom that is better than the current 1% level in @xmath65 will be required .",
    "furthermore there is no guarantee that the @xmath107 fudge will work to this level of precision .",
    "fortunately the higher acoustic peaks provide a built in self - consistency test of recombination . since the recombination rate @xmath107 has been downgraded from a physical parameter to a fitting parameter , a more physically interesting way to phrase the sensitivity is to change recombination through the fine structure constant @xmath80 . in the recombination calculation , all of the binding energies scale as @xmath108 , @xmath109 and ( @xcite 1999 ) @xmath110 in addition @xmath111 .",
    "the phenomenology of the cmb is primarily governed by the redshift of recombination @xmath112 though that dependence is largely hidden in standard recombination by its insensitivity to the usual cosmological parameters .",
    "this insensitivity and the sensitivity to @xmath80 follows from the fact that recombination proceeds rapidly once @xmath113 has reached a certain threshold . defining the redshift of recombination as the epoch at which the thomson optical depth during recombination ( i.e. excluding reionization ) reaches unity , @xmath114 , a fit to the recombination calculation gives ( e.g. @xcite 2003 ) . in principle",

    "the sensitivity to cosmological parameters is weak . around the fiducial model of @xmath119 and @xmath120 ,",
    "the recombination redshift becomes @xmath121 however one can not translate the typical cmb constraints on @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 into constraints on @xmath80 since the values of all three are determined in the context of standard recombination .",
    "we shall now see how constraints from acoustic phenomena arise in a general context .",
    "the cmb acoustic peaks are governed by 4 physical quantities : the photon - baryon ratio , the matter - radiation ratio , the sound horizon , and the diffusion scale all evaluated at the epoch of recombination . in the standard thermal history context ,",
    "the photon and neutrino densities are fixed by the measurement of the cmb temperature and @xmath125 .",

    "the overall physical scale associated with the acoustic phenomena is self - calibrated under standard recombination .",
    "this is the distance sound can travel by recombination @xmath132 where the sound speed @xmath133 and the second line assumes that only matter and radiation are important in @xmath134 before recombination . around the fiducial model , @xmath135 therefore , in the standard recombination context where @xmath136 , the cmb provides an absolutely calibrated ( in mpc , not @xmath23 mpc ) standard ruler for cosmology .",
    "more generally the standard ruler carries a scaling factor of @xmath137 if only @xmath129 and @xmath130 are determined .",
    "this standard thermal history assumption is important to bear in mind when using this standard ruler for dark energy tests .",
    "cmb constraints implicitly use this standard ruler in a distance measure test for dark energy .",
    "the sound horizon sets the fundamental physical scale of the peaks which is then measured in angular or multipole space as @xmath138 with the absolute calibration of @xmath139 ,",
    "the cmb then measures the angular diameter distance @xmath140 to recombination in absolute units .",
    "note that even though the standard parameter analyses usually assume a simple dark energy model when calculating constraints , they may be readily translated into a general context by error propagation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmbstuff ] we show an example where wmap errors on @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( @xcite 2003 ) are used to delimit a region in the three dimensional distance measure space of curvature , constant @xmath61 and @xmath6 .    for quick estimation purposes or a poor - man s mcmc ,",
    "note that the dominant source of error in the sound horizon calibration is from @xmath124 and that the measurement errors on @xmath144 are comparatively small .",

    "improving the distance measure and the calibration of the standard ruler @xmath152 thus is best achieved by accurately measuring the 3rd and higher acoustic peaks .    beyond the third peak in the temperature ,",
    "the cmb can test the internal consistency of the standard thermal history .",
    "the damping of the acoustic peaks is associated with the radiative transfer or diffusion of the cmb photons during recombination . under standard recombination",
    ", the diffusion distance is uniquely determined by the baryon and matter densities @xmath153 and @xmath149 and presents another absolutely calibrated standard ruler .",
    "however a change in the thermal history that delays recombination will allow the photons to diffuse further ( @xcite 2000 ) even if the dynamics in the tight coupling regime is held fixed by keeping @xmath154 and @xmath155 the same . in fig .",
    "[ fig : recombination]b we see that models with a recombination variation due to @xmath80 start to differ at the third peak .",
    "given a thermal history , the damping effect can be quantified via boltzmann techniques given in @xcite ( 1997 ) .",
    "the result is that the damping scale can be approximated by @xmath156^{1/2 } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in comparison to the acoustic scale , the damping scale has a stronger dependence on the redshift of recombination and the baryons . around the fiducial model",

    "[ fig : recombination]b ( dashed lines ) we rescale the power spectrum of the fiducial model to the @xmath161 of the varying @xmath80 models by multiplying by the ratio of @xmath162 .",
    "the good agreement explicitly demonstrates that aside from damping , the morphology of the acoustic peaks is preserved at fixed @xmath154 and @xmath155 .    in summary the damping scale and the associated polarization",
    "is a consistency check on the standard thermal history assumptions .",
    "under these assumptions both are uniquely predicted by the low order temperature peaks .",
    "problems with the assumptions on the recombination history , e.g. the fine structure constant or a more prosaic problem with the multilevel hydrogen atom would manifest themselves here .",
    "likewise problems in the assumption of the radiation density , e.g. a change in the number or temperature of the neutrinos , would show up here due a change in the damping scale relative to the acoustic scale and also due to effects from their anisotropic stress .",
    "finally any contamination from secondary anisotropies and point sources would show up more strongly here .",
    "current small scale anisotropy and polarization data is in good agreement with the predictions from the first three peaks .",
    "these consistency tests provide more confidence that the sound horizon is both an internally calibrated and internally consistent standard ruler that can be used for dark energy probes , at least to the current level of precision in the standard .",
    "the cmb also provides a calibration standard for dark energy and/or massive neutrino growth rate tests .",
    "the height of the acoustic peaks is now very well calibrated ( @xcite 2003 ) and in conjunction with the well understood radiation transfer described in the previous sections , it can be converted into a measurement of the initial amplitude of fluctuations .    for illustrative purposes",
    ", we will here assume that the neutrino masses are negligible .",
    "the initial spectrum of curvature fluctuations @xmath163 @xmath164 is processed through the radiation transfer to become the cmb power spectra and matter power spectrum . here",
    "@xmath165 is the normalization scale and we will follow the wmap convention of choosing @xmath166 mpc@xmath54 . note that the actual pivot point or best constrained normalization point for wmap is closer to @xmath167 mpc@xmath54 corresponding to the first peak .",
    "the amplitude of fluctuations from wmap is @xmath168 or equivalently in terms of the wmap normalization parameter @xmath169 if taken instead as the amplitude at the pivot point , the uncertainties in @xmath170 come almost entirely from that in the optical depth @xmath171 ; with the fiducial choice there is a small increase in the uncertainties due to the constraint on the tilt . in any case the amplitude of the initial fluctuations is known to better than 10% at scales relevant to large - scale structure .",
    "this calibration exceeds the accuracy to which the normalization of the power spectrum at the current epoch is known .",
    "thus for dark energy tests involving the growth of structure , it is already advantageous to compare high redshift structure to the cmb normalization instead of the local normalization .",
    "in addition , a measurement of the local @xmath0 normalization also becomes a test of the dark energy .",
    "the matter power spectrum is processed through the same radiation transfer as the cmb and so the latter determines the former . in the standard cosmology",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the transfer function when expressed in mpc@xmath54 depends only on the well determined @xmath172 and @xmath149 .",
    "thus both the shape and the normalization of the matter power spectrum in the deceleration epoch is fixed in physical units of mpc .",
    "the amplitude at @xmath0 then becomes a measure of the dark energy .",
    "it is usually quoted in terms of the rms of the linear density field smoothed by a tophat of radius @xmath173mpc ( @xcite 2003 ) @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the fourier transform of a top hat window .",
    "@xmath176 the growth function evaluated at the current epoch .",
    "note that because the normalization is given in @xmath23 mpc , there is a strong scaling with the hubble constant . in a flat universe @xmath177 and precise measurements of @xmath124",
    "then fix @xmath6 given @xmath147 .",
    "we shall see in the next section that the hubble constant is the single most useful complement to cmb parameters for dark energy studies .",
    "likewise a measurement of @xmath178 is a measurement of the specific combination of dark energy parameters above . at high redshift , one replaces @xmath179 in equation  ( [ eqn : sigma8 ] ) and so the measurement of structure as a function of redshift can in principle measure the whole growth function .    in summary ,",
    "the cmb standard fluctuation is internally calibrated , this time by the large - angle polarization - temperature cross correlation through @xmath171 .",
    "the inference on @xmath171 will be more thoroughly tested once the polarization auto power spectrum becomes available .",
    "furthermore an independent internal consistency check on this calibration is provided by the gravitational lensing signature in the cmb ( @xcite 2002 ; @xcite 2003 ) .",
    "the cmb has provided two self - calibrated standards for dark energy studies , a standard ruler : the sound horizon at recombination and a standard fluctuation : the initial amplitude of fluctuations at the @xmath180 mpc@xmath54 scale .",
    "their respective calibration errors are currently @xmath181 and @xmath182 respectively . with the sound horizon calibration ,",
    "the peak locations constrain the distance to the recombination surface to the same fractional accuracy .    with the addition of better small scale anisotropy and large scale polarization measurements",
    "one can expect that the statistical errors will further improve by up to a factor of 10 .",
    "moreover internal consistency tests should ensure accuracy and test for systematic errors .",
    "it is therefore interesting to reconsider the dark energy observables keeping the cmb standards , i.e. the high redshift universe and hence @xmath140 , @xmath183 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 fixed .",
    "we shall see that this perspective leads to several counterintuitive results which highlight the importance of accurate local calibration over redshift range or depth .    in fig .",

    "the asymptotic deviations correspond to variations in the hubble constant .    the deviations due to @xmath45 at fixed @xmath206 ( or equivalently @xmath61 ) and those for @xmath47 at fixed @xmath48 have similar forms since to leading order they are both tied to uncertainties in the hubble constant .",
    "this similarity implies a degeneracy between @xmath48 and @xmath47 along a line of @xmath207 which holds @xmath201 fixed . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : parameterization ] , a degeneracy between @xmath48 and @xmath47 simply implies that the equation of state is better constrained at a redshift that differs from @xmath0 . in this cmb context with fixed high-@xmath202 quantities , this implies @xmath208 from eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : pivot ] ) or @xmath209 as the epoch at which the dark energy equation of state is best constrained .",
    "recall that a measurement of @xmath210 at any redshift would rule out a cosmological constant .",
    "conversely a confirmation of @xmath211 at such a redshift would strongly favor a cosmological constant since an alternate solution would require a @xmath47 variation that sent the dark energy to a phantom regime @xmath212 in the past expansion history , or a stronger variation in @xmath50 that violated the @xmath47 linearization .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : deviation]c , we plot the deviations along this degeneracy line ( deviations are here actually between @xmath213 , @xmath206 and @xmath214 , @xmath215 to avoid the phantom dark energy regime ) .",
    "note the change in scale of the axes . because this line preserves the hubble constant , the deviations in @xmath188 and @xmath190 now coincide and disappear at both low and high redshift .",
    "the hubble parameter deviations persist until higher redshift and the growth function deviations remain fairly level for @xmath216 .",
    "note that still a measurement of the growth function locally provides a means of breaking the degeneracy . in any case ,",
    "any means of breaking the degeneracy left at constant @xmath201 will require percent level accuracy in the measurements and calibration of the standards .    finally these patterns also appear with variations involving the curvature or @xmath217 .",
    "as is well known , variations in the curvature off of a flat cosmology are allowed by the cmb but come at the cost of a change in the hubble constant . again",
    "an accurate hubble constant is the key . with @xmath61 , a more subtle degeneracy with @xmath217 at fixed",
    "@xmath218 opens up ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : deviation]d ) . in this case measurement of the growth function at the present epoch becomes even more important since the distance degenerate increment in @xmath61 and decrement in @xmath217 both slow the growth of structure .",
    "note though that at the @xmath219 level in growth rate , massive neutrinos will certainly have to be included in the interpretation and error budget .    in summary , to test the cosmological constant hypothesis and measure the equation of state of the dark energy at @xmath220 , the best complement to current and future cmb measurements is a measurement of the hubble constant that is accurate at the few percent level .",
    "ironically , one way of achieving this is to measure the relative luminosity distance to a redshift in the deceleration regime .",
    "if the measurement is inconsistent with a cosmological constant , then to further measure the evolution of @xmath50 through @xmath47 or rule out an alternate explanation involving spatial curvature will require percent level measurement and calibration of standard candles , rulers , number densities at intermediate redshifts or fluctuations at any redshift .",
    "the general considerations of the previous sections can be turned into specific forecasts for dark energy parameters given assumptions about the observations in question : both on the cmb side and on the dark energy probe side .",
    "if the observations are expected to constrain the models to live in a small region of parameter space and systematic errors are negligible , then linear propagation of statistical errors , also known as fisher matrix forecasts , provide a useful guide to their capabilities .",
    "unfortunately one can make a dark energy parameter forecast give practically any desired answer by adjusting prior assumptions both on the cosmology and the systematic error floor .",
    "( first rule of parameter estimation : state your priors .",
    "second rule of parameter estimation : state your priors . ) as an exercise , here we will try to compare on an equal footing ( when titles end with a question mark , the answer is no ) several different dark energy probes that can come out of a deep and wide optical survey .",
    "specifically we assume a multi - color survey that allows binning of galaxies to @xmath221 out to @xmath222 across 4000 deg@xmath223 .",
    "we will assume cmb priors that come from a forecast of the planck satellite assuming only statistical errors in a parameter space that includes @xmath149 , @xmath172 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , tensors , and @xmath171 as well as the dark energy parameters of interest ( @xcite 2002 ) .",
    "as we have seen in ",
    "[ sec : cmb ] , the critical cmb assumptions are on the physical matter density @xmath226 which controls the calibration of the sound horizon and @xmath227 which controls the calibration of the growth function .",
    "we also assume a spatially flat universe .",
    "given that the sound horizon at recombination is already calibrated at the few percent level , its appearance in the matter power spectrum as baryon features or  wiggles \" provides a theoretically robust , but observationally challenging , probe of the dark energy ( @xcite 1999 ) .",
    "much recent work has gone into their utilization in a high-@xmath202 redshift survey ( e.g. @xcite 2003 ; @xcite 2003 ; @xcite 2003 ) .",
    "it is interesting to investigate to what extent a photometric survey can utilize the baryon features .",
    "a photometric survey essentially loses all ability to measure the hubble parameter @xmath134 directly through the standard ruler in the radial direction unless @xmath228 . as a means of measuring the angular diameter distance @xmath188 , a photometric survey fairs",
    "better ( @xcite 2001 ) . at high redshift ,",
    "the change in the distance per unit redshift is small and even a fairly thick shell of @xmath229 produces very little smearing of the features due to projection . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wiggles ] , we show the angular power spectrum of galaxies in haloes @xmath230 predicted under the halo model described in @xcite ( 2003 ) .",
    "of course , a measurement of @xmath188 from the angular power spectrum still does not rival that from the 3d power spectrum given the loss of radially directed modes .",
    "the relative degradation as a function of redshift resolution can be estimated by a simple mode counting argument ( @xcite 2003 ) .",
    "still the angular power spectrum does yield some constraint on the dark energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wiggles ] , we show the results of a fisher forecast with 10 redshift bins @xmath231 taking only the quasi - linear regime @xmath232 for the where the halo model for the galaxy clustering is relatively robust .",
    "to be conservative we marginalize over 5 halo model parameters per redshift bin as described in @xcite ( 2003 ) . in the context of a constant @xmath61 ,",
    "angular features allow a joint determination with @xmath6 . in the context of the @xmath233 plane ( marginalized over @xmath6 ) there",
    "remains a degeneracy that lies close to a line of constant @xmath201 . although these constraints are relatively weak , they are theoretically robust and come more or less for free given an optical survey with a well quantified selection .",
    "an optical galaxy survey can also exploit the cmb standard fluctuation calibration if one can relate the observables to the underlying mass spectrum .",
    "one way of doing so is to also measure the gravitational lensing shear distortion of the background galaxy images by mass in the foreground .",
    "consider first consider the mass associated with the dark matter halos around foreground galaxies called galaxy - galaxy lensing . by correlating the foreground galaxy positions with the background galaxy shears ,",
    "one measures the galaxy - shear angular power spectrum .",
    "combined with the galaxy - galaxy angular power spectrum , one can extract the bias in the linear regime or more generally the bias divided by the galaxy - mass correlation coefficient .",
    "given a halo model for the association of galaxies with dark matter halos , even the latter can be converted into a measurement of the mass power spectrum ( @xcite 2002 ) .    as a proof of principle",
    "let us again consider the halo model in @xcite ( 2003 ) but now allow constraints from @xmath234 from the 10 foreground galaxy redshift bins out to @xmath222 again selecting @xmath235 . for the background galaxies , we assume 4 bins of @xmath236 out to @xmath222 and an additional bin for all higher redshift background galaxies .",
    "we choose a distribution of background galaxies with a median redshift of @xmath237 , an angular density of @xmath238 gal arcmin@xmath239 , and a shear error per component per galaxy of @xmath240 . with these assumptions",
    "the combination of galaxy - shear and galaxy - galaxy power spectra can constrain @xmath48 and @xmath47 separately as in fig .",
    "[ fig : shearabundance ] .    galaxy - lens constraints on the dark energy require the assumption of a model for the association of galaxies to the dark matter whose validity must be verified .",
    "shear - shear correlation on the other hand depend only on the large - scale matter distribution and is theoretically more robust but observationally more difficult to measure .",
    "constraints from the cross correlation of the shear - shear measurements from the same binning scheme and noise assumptions as above are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shearabundance ] ( @xcite 1999 ) .",
    "here we have taken @xmath241 since the shear field remains gaussian and theoretically predictable to smaller scales than the galaxy field .",
    "shear - shear and galaxy - lens data of this quality have similar constraining power with regards to the dark energy and may be used to cross - check each other .",
    "finally let us consider the cluster abundance .",
    "the cluster abundance at a fixed mass is exponentially sensitive to the amplitude of linear fluctuations at a given redshift ( see e.g. @xcite 2001 ) . given the cmb normalization of fluctuations at high redshift even the local cluster abundance becomes a constraint on the dark energy that can measure a constant equation of state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : deviation]a ) . at high redshift",
    ", the cluster abundance can measure the evolution of the equation of state ( @xcite 2001 ) .",
    "the central concern is whether the cluster selection can be calibrated in mass at the required level of accuracy of better than a few percent .",
    "the main hope is that the wealth of observables beyond the optical , extending from the radio to x - ray frequencies , will allow an accurate mass calibration . given that the full suite will only be available at fairly low redshift , it may be wiser to focus on the mass calibration of the local sample when measuring @xmath61 ( @xcite 2003 ) .",
    "recall also that the total growth to @xmath0 is also a good way to separate curvature and dark energy effects .",
    "nonetheless , let us suppose that we can count all of the clusters above @xmath242 in the 10 redshift bins . with a perfect calibration of the mass threshold , the cluster abundance can provide interesting constraints on both @xmath48 and @xmath47 with the main degeneracy line again following a constant @xmath201 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shearabundance ] ) .",
    "if on the other hand , the mass - observable relation that controls the mass threshold @xmath243 is allowed to undergo a power law evolution in redshift which must be determined by the abundance measurements themselves , the constraints degrade substantially , especially in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "fortunately , clusters have more observables then simply their abundance above threshold in a single observable . with multiple observables",
    "it is possible to self - calibrate the mass threshold in principle .",
    "here we show a minimal example of self calibration which involves the sample variance of the cluster counts themselves and hence is fully internal to a cluster abundance survey .",
    "some of the lost information is regained since the sample variance or clustering of clusters as a function of their mass is known from simulations ( see @xcite 2004 ; @xcite 2003 for details ) .",
    "the cmb has already provided a set of accurately calibrated standards for dark energy studies .",
    "the sound horizon at and distance to recombination is measured to better than 4% and the amplitude of initial fluctuations at large - scale structure scales of @xmath244mpc@xmath54 to better than 10% by the wmap data alone .",
    "moreover , the expansion history , e.g. distances , volumes and the hubble parameter , during the whole deceleration epoch has been determined to the level controlled by errors in @xmath245  currently less than @xmath246 once all of the cmb data is considered . with",
    "the high-@xmath202 expansion history fixed , a measurement of even local @xmath0 observables can determine the dark energy equation of state .",
    "the caveat to using this long lever arm to measure the dark energy is that the local and high redshift standards must be accurately calibrated .",
    "cmb inferences are based on an interpretation of the acoustic peaks that has passed internal consistency checks in the damping tail and polarization .",
    "the critical assumption underlying the interpretation is the thermal history of the universe and we have focused on recombination and reionization as a challenge for the sub percent level calibration of cmb standards .    given expected improvements in the measurements of cmb standards , deviations due to the dark energy in distance and growth measures appear mainly at low redshift .",
    "the former mainly represent deviations in the hubble constant .",
    "it is ironic that the primary quantity that dark energy probes measure in light of the cmb is the hubble constant .",
    "this includes high-@xmath202 sne .",
    "nonetheless , a hubble constant determination would measure the dark energy equation of state at @xmath1 in a flat universe at comparable fractional precision .",
    "if this quantity is measured to be inconsistent with a cosmological constant , then distance measures at intermediate redshifts or growth measures at any redshift can be used to test its evolution and/or contamination in its determination from a small spatial curvature . however , in this case the expected deviations are smaller and will require even more accurate measurement and calibration of standards .",
    "cmb standards are naturally exploited by deep optical surveys .",
    "the sound horizon appears as baryonic features in angular and spatial power spectra and can be used to measure distances .",
    "the density fluctuation calibration enters into the clustering of galaxies , galaxy - galaxy lensing and cosmic shear as well as the abundance of rich clusters .",
    "exploiting these standards with observations that match the accuracy of cmb determinations will be the challenge for future dark energy probes ."
