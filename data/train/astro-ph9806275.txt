    "deep x - ray surveys with rosat have revealed a rapidly increasing number of ` narrow - line x - ray galaxies ' ( nlxgs ) at moderate redshifts ( @xmath12 ) and luminosities ( @xmath13  ergs  s@xmath6 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "nlxgs were first discovered in early 210 kev sky surveys ( e.g. , _",
    ", @xcite ; heao-1 , @xcite ) .",
    "since these nlxgs are highly absorbed ( @xmath14  @xmath15 ; @xcite ) at low x - ray energies , their rosat counterparts may be the absorbed agn population posited ( @xcite ) to solve both the hard x  ray background ` spectral paradox ' ( @xcite ) and the hard x - ray / soft x - ray source counts discrepancy ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this picture is not without problems however : it predicts extremely hard rosat spectra , and asca fluxes many times brighter than rosat .",
    "yet neither is found ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the nlxgs may not all be agn ; in high quality optical spectra half the nlxgs have no broad h@xmath16 ( @xcite ) and so may be starbursts , rather than agn .",
    "the brightest nlxg is ngc  7582 , which has linewidths @xmath17  200  km  s@xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and no broad components out to brackett-@xmath18 ( @xcite ) . as such , ngc  7582",
    "is the best and the brightest nlxg candidate for being starburst dominated , and may serve as a prototype of the new faint nlxg population .",
    "x - ray observations can be critical to determining the presence of an agn .",
    "previous x - ray spectra ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and variability measurements ( @xcite ) of ngc  7582 however , have been hampered by bright confusing sources : the background cluster abell s1101 is 53@xmath19away ( @xcite ) , while the bl  lac object pks  2316@xmath20423 is only @xmath21 away ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this _",
    "we describe asca sis and rosat hri observations of ngc  7582 , separating the contributions of the agn and the bl  lac .",
    "these demonstrate that even this purely narrow - line object clearly harbors an agn ; simultaneously these data suggest an answer to the problems of the soft x - ray flux from nlxgs .",
    "an asca observation in sis 2 ccd mode ( along the diagonal ) and carefully oriented to place both ngc 7582 and pks  2316@xmath20423 near the axis , was performed on 1994 november 11 , aquiring 17.0  ks in sis0 and 18.2  ks in sis1 on ngc  7582 .",
    "both sources were clearly detected . at 0.1  cts  s@xmath6 ,",
    "ngc  7582 dominates the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) band by a factor of @xmath12.3 .",
    "a total of 4067 net sis counts were detected from ngc  7582 , allowing complex spectral fits .",
    "we used the ascascreen default criteria 0.01 ; elv @xmath010 ; br_earth @xmath020 cor_min @xmath22 ; pixl rejection threshold @xmath2375 ( standard for 2ccd mode ) ; remove hot and flickering pixels , event grades 0 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "data from bright and faint ( `` bright2 '' ) mode , and high- and medium - bit rate data , were combined . ] for data screening , extracted the sis spectra from the recommended 4@xmath19 radius region ( abc guide ) and binned to give @xmath010  counts per bin . there were no high background intervals in the sis full  field light curves .",
    "soft ( 0.52 kev ) and hard ( 38 kev ) sis x  ray light curves ( figure 1 ) in 8 bins , one per orbit , spanning a 40  ks time base , for the combined sis0 and sis1 data , detect ngc  7582 at @xmath24 in each orbit in both bands .",
    "the hard count rate is significantly variable ( @xmath25=21.9 ) , showing a clear ( 9.2@xmath26 ) 40% decre < ase in @xmath16  ks between bins 5 and 6 , and remaining low for the rest of the observation423 sis data , we find no analogous abrupt change in flux ; qualitatively , the bl lac spectrum is more short  time variable than that of ngc 7582 . ]",
    "the soft count rate shows no such drop and is consistent with a constant value ( @xmath27 ) , excluding the fifth bin , which lies @xmath15@xmath26 from the mean and may be due to bad background subtraction . including the 5th bin gives @xmath28",
    ". the hardness ratio , which is essentially constant through bin 5 , is significantly lower in bins 6 - 8 .",
    "we refer to the first five bins as the _ high state _ , and to the remainder as the _ low state_.    we fit the high and low state spectra separately using xspec 10.00 ( @xcite ) , using the 1994 november 9 calibrations .",
    "the galactic line - of - sight @xmath29 is low ( @xmath30  @xmath15 ; @xcite ) , due to the proximity to the south galactic pole .",
    "both sis detectors gave consistent results , and so we report only simultaneous fits ( table  [ tbl_fits ] ) . a simple power ",
    "law fit is unacceptable ( @xmath31 ; model a in table  [ tbl_fits ] ) .",
    "see figure 2 .",
    "( a fit to just the 2 - 10 kev range does give an acceptable power - law fit of @xmath32 . )",
    "[ spec_fig ]    addition of a low  energy unabsorbed continuum component , either thermal bremsstrahlung ( @xmath33  kev ) or a second , steep power - law ( @xmath34 ) produces a good fit ( models b and c ) .    although a partial covering model ( model d ) does significantly better than a single power law ( and the underlying power law photon index is more typical of canonical agn values ) , adding a soft , unabsorbed component is the preferred model , since an @xmath35test gives a @xmath099% improvement in the fit going from model d to model c. interestingly , the partial covering model yields emission ",
    "line  like residuals near 1  kev , as have been reported in ngc 4151 ( @xcite ) .",
    "no changes in the parameters , except normalization , are seen ( at 90% confidence ) between the two states .",
    "the steep power - law needed at low energies is inconsistent with the higher energy power - law at high confidence .",
    "using the power - law plus bremsstrahlung fit ( model b ) , the high ( low)state luminosity , l@xmath36 , of ngc  7582 in units of 10@xmath37ergs  s@xmath6 is 23@xmath38 ( 17@xmath39 ) in the 210  kev band , and 0.62@xmath40 ( 0.59@xmath41 ) in the 0.52.0  kev band .",
    "so the low energy , rosat band , luminosity is 3%  4% of the 2 - 10  kev luminosity .",
    "( luminosities are as observed , i.e. uncorrected for absorption .",
    "we adopt a distance of 27 mpc [ @xcite ] . )",
    "absorbing material produces fluorescence lines , notably fe - k @xmath16 a narrow ( @xmath26=100  ev ) gaussian line at the cold fe - k fluorescence line ( 6.4  kev ) , plus a power - law in the energy range 3.58 kev , gives 90% confidence upper limits on the line equivalent width , @xmath17230 ev ( sis1 , low state ) , @xmath17310 ev ( sis0 , high state ) .",
    "the absorbing @xmath42 would produce a neutral fe - k edge ( at 7.1 kev ) with @xmath43 .",
    "our 90% confidence limit is @xmath44 .",
    "the rosat hri observed ngc  7582 for 17.2  ksec on 1995 may 23 , some 6  months after the asca observation .",
    "the image was _ obi  shifted _ to reduce aspect problems ( @xcite ) and smoothed with a 5@xmath45 gaussian .",
    "a source is found positionally coincident with ngc 7582 ( using iraf / pros tasks xexamine , imcnts and a radius@xmath238@xmath45 circle ) , containing 225  @xmath46  32 cts .    the source confusion that has dogged ngc  7582 continues with the discovery of a new bright hri source 2@xmath19to the ne ( j2000.0 : 23@xmath4718@xmath4829.9@xmath49 , @xmath2042@xmath5020@xmath19 41@xmath454 ) , which has 90  @xmath46  26  counts , and so 40% of the flux of ngc 7582 in the 0.52.0 kev band radius 2@xmath26 hri error circle , b=20.2 and 21.1 ( @xcite ) , allow an agn or bl  lac identification or , for the brighter optical object , a star of type m0v or later ( @xcite ) . ] .",
    "assuming a @xmath51kev bremsstrahlung with galactic absorption , this implies a total luminosity ( ngc 7582 + ne source ) of l@xmath52 @xmath5310@xmath54 ergs  s@xmath6 . for the asca sis0 best  fit bremsstrahlung model ,",
    "the corresponding result is l@xmath52 @xmath5510@xmath54 ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "the observed full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) of ngc 7582 ( from the iraf task imexamine ) is 4.7@xmath45 , and of the ne source 5.0@xmath45 . since the expected fwhm for a point source is 6  ( @xcite ) , both ngc 7582 and the ne source are unresolved by this measure .",
    "however , the hri image of ngc  7582 appears more asymmetric than that of the ne source . to investigate",
    ", we divided the sources into 4 quadrants ( @xcite ) of radius 20@xmath45 , with the dividing lines ( 1 ) parallel to the n - s and e - w axes ; and ( 2 ) rotated by 45@xmath56 . in both cases , the image of the ne source was found to be consistent with a symmetric profile , but the image of ngc  7582 is asymmetric ",
    "brighter on the e side in case 2 at @xmath57 , and @xmath02.5@xmath26 fainter on the s side ; fainter on the sw side at @xmath02.5@xmath26 , in case 1 .",
    "subtracting a scaled and shifted image of the ne source from ngc  7582 gives 2 - 3  @xmath26 residuals to the se , confirming the asymmetry .",
    "however , given the poor s / n in the ne source we can not rule out the asymmetry in ngc  7582 being an artifact of residual rosat aspect solution errors .",
    "an agn dominates the hard x - ray emission from ngc  7582 .",
    "the asca hard x - ray flux drops by 40% in @xmath16 ks , implying a source size of @xmath58  cm , for which an agn is the only known possibility .",
    "this is 30 times more variable than the x - ray flare previously reported by @xcite .",
    "the low energy component in the ngc  7582 x - ray spectrum solves two problems with the @xcite ` obscured agn ' model for the x - ray background : ( 1 ) the predicted rosat band spectra of nlxgs should be extremely hard , since the shape will be dominated by the strongly energy dependent ( @xmath59 ) photoelectric absorption cross - sections ( tucker 1975 ) , yet @xcite find quite normal @xmath60=1.5 slopes and @xcite find an even steeper @xmath612.4 ; ( 2 ) with the predicted n@xmath62 distribution , most ( 70%  90% ) nlxgs should be _ at least _ 10 times brighter in asca , yet the four rosat nlxgs studied by @xcite , are just 412 times brighter in asca , implying a maximum column density of 2.5@xmath6310@xmath64@xmath15 ( for @xmath60=0.8 ) .    both of these difficulties are removed by an extra , soft , x - ray spectral feature in ngc  7582 : ( 1 ) the low energy component has a power - law slope comparable to that of bright rosat nlxgs ( @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) the low energy component prevents the asca to rosat flux ratio from exceeding 20 , more in line with the ratios implied in @xcite .",
    "even so a bright source with this spectrum at 1@xmath65ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath6 in the 2 - 10  kev band , would be one of the faintest rosat sources in the 0.5 - 2.0  kev band , at 3@xmath66ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath6 . without the extra soft component ,",
    "a simple absorbed power - law spectrum would have a flux of @xmath67ergs  @xmath15  s@xmath6 in rosat , and so would be undetectable .",
    "the @xcite asca / rosat ratios for nlxgs indicate somewhat larger uncovered fractions , @xmath115% .",
    "what is this soft x - ray component in the asca spectrum ?",
    "the constancy of the soft x - rays rules out a simple uncovered fraction of the central continuum , and instead ( with the possible hri asymmetries ) suggests an extended origin .",
    "( although the hint of soft - band variability should be borne in mind . )",
    "certainly , kiloparsec scale extended soft x  ray emission is known in other agn ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , where it may be of nuclear or starburst origin ( @xcite ) .",
    "hot gas is the likely dominant emitter in either case . in ngc  7582 , emission line ratios ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and",
    "widths ( @xcite ) allow either a type2 seyfert or an h  ii  region dominated object .",
    "@xcite concludes that the extended ` diffuse ' radio emission , the 4@xmath45 radius ( 1@xmath68  pc at 27  mpc ) h@xmath16 disk ( @xcite ) , and the iras far - infrared emission in ngc  7582 are all powered by stellar processes , not by an agn .",
    "a starburst / agn composite seems to be required ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , especially given the hard x - ray variability .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the soft component in ngc  7582 is modest , 10100 times smaller than that of the brighter , reliably identified ( ha98 ) nlxgs from the `` crss '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) and comparable with starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) . in order to explain nlxg luminosities up to 10@xmath69erg  s@xmath6 , and to maintain relatively constant soft / hard band x - ray luminosities , it is more plausible that the soft component is a direct result of nuclear activity , rather than indirect via a starburst ( @xcite )",
    ". this favors compton - scattered nuclear emission , or jet / outflow - related emission over a starburst .",
    "compton reflection could allow some variability if the ` mirror ' is close to the nuclear source .    the column density within ngc  7582 decreased by a factor @xmath16 in the 6 years prior to the asca observations .",
    "the best non - imaging x - ray spectrum of ngc  7582 was obtained with ginga in 1988 october ; @xcite found @xmath70  @xmath15 , keeping @xmath60 fixed at 1.7 .",
    "we find , in the asca energy range and assuming the same fixed @xmath60 , @xmath71  @xmath15.423 , which was not , has such a heavily absorbed spectrum ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "a column density at the ginga level in nlxgs would render the central agn component fainter by a factor 10@xmath72 .",
    "this is one of the larger variations in column density known in agn , similar in both timescale and amplitude to those in ngc  4151 ( @xcite ) .",
    "changes on this timescale can be created by motions of molecular clouds in a starburst model , but the amplitude may be hard to reproduce .",
    "ngc 7582 is the brightest example of the class of nlxgs found in the deepest rosat observations ( @xcite ) , with no broad ( @xmath0 1000 km  s@xmath6 ) components on their optical emission lines , and may serve as the prototype of the class .",
    "our analysis of asca and rosat observations of ngc  7582 has shown :    1 .   a rapid ( @xmath16  ksec )",
    "40% decrease in the asca sis hard ( @xmath03  kev ) x  ray flux , requiring a compact , agn source , with an observed ( absorbed ) 210 kev luminosity of @xmath1 @xmath73  ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "2 .   an additional , separate",
    ", emission component is present in the asca sis soft band ( 0.5 - 2  kev , @xmath74  ergs  s@xmath6 ) with a steep ( @xmath60=2.4 ) unabsorbed spectrum .",
    "3 .   a heavily obscured ( @xmath75  @xmath15 ) nuclear source , that has likely become 6 times less obscured over the last 6 years .",
    "this may cause difficulty explaining the absorbers as being associated with nuclear starbursts , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "* ngc  7582 is the dominant source ( by a factor of 23 ) of 210  kev emission in the field containing itself and the bl lac object pks 2316@xmath20423 .",
    "* in the soft x - ray band ngc  7582 dominates the newly discovered source 2  @xmath19ne by a factor 2 .",
    "these observations make it clear that the hard x  ray emission of ngc  7582 , the most ` narrow - line ' of the nlxgs , is associated with an agn .",
    "the strong suggestion is that _ all _ nlxg are obscured agns , as hypothesized to explain the hard x - ray background spectral paradox ; but that it is a separate soft x - ray component that makes nlxgs detectable as rosat sources , and provides their agn - like x - ray slope .",
    "quite likely this soft component is extended , and thermal in nature .",
