    "we first illustrate the theory to calculate the percolation threshold for a single uncorrelated network following the standard calculations done by moore and newman @xcite .",
    "we then generalize this theory to the case of two correlated interconnected networks to calculate @xmath21 under redundant and conditional modes of failures .",
    "the percolation problem of a single network can be solved by the calculation of the probability @xmath63 to reach the giant component by following a randomly chosen link @xcite .",
    "first , choose a link of a single network at random .",
    "after that , select one of its ends with equal probability .",
    "the probability @xmath64 is the probability that , by following this link using the chosen direction , we do not arrive at the giant component , but instead we connect to a finite component .",
    "since the degree distribution of an end node of a chosen link is given by @xmath65 , one can write down a recursive equation for @xmath63 as : @xmath66 the sum is for the probability that , by following the chosen link , we arrive at a node with degree @xmath67 which is not attached to the giant component through its remaining @xmath68 connections .",
    "we rewrite the previous equation as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70    once the probability @xmath63 is known , we can use it to write the probability @xmath71 that a randomly chosen node does not belong to the giant component .",
    "again , this is a sum of probabilities : the probability that this node has no links attached to it , plus the probability that this node has one link and this link does not lead to the giant component , plus the probability that this node has two links and none of them leads to the giant component , and so on . in other words : @xmath72 again , we can rewrite this equation as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 note that the probability @xmath75 not only stands for the probability of choosing one node from the giant component at random , but also provides the fraction of nodes in the network occupied by the giant component .",
    "equation ( [ eq.singles ] ) provides the probability of a node to belong to the giant component and is the main quantity to be calculated by the theory from where the value of the percolation threshold can be calculated as the largest value of @xmath21 such that @xmath76 .",
    "now , we present a generalization of the above approach suited to both problems studied in our work , namely , the redundant and conditional interactions of two interconnected networks with generic correlations . we have also developed an analogous theoretical framework based on the generating approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , we find that the generating function approach @xcite is more mathematically cumbersome if one wants to take into account the correlations between the networks to calculate the mutually connected giant component",
    ". since the size of the giant component is the only quantity needed in this study , we find that the approach of moore and newman is more transparent and , furthermore , allows us to take into account both modes of failure in a single theory .",
    "indeed , the whole theory can be cast into a few number of equations , while the generating function approach is more involved .",
    "we define two probabilities for network @xmath9 ( and their equivalents for network @xmath10 ) . as we did for the case of a single network",

    "the following recursive equations are general and can be applied to the redundant and to the conditional interaction cases depending of the way the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are written for each case .",
    "therefore , below we develop the theory for both modes of failure and later we specialize on each interaction .",

    "thus , @xmath117 ( and its counterpart @xmath118 for network @xmath10 ) is the fraction occupied by the largest component of survival node in network @xmath9 . for a finite size network , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the number of nodes in the largest component and @xmath122 the number of nodes in network @xmath9 .",
    "it is important to note that due to the condition ( ii ) this fraction is necessarily the same as the size of the giant connected component of network @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath117 may be interpreted also as the fraction from network @xmath9 that is part of the mutually connected giant component @xmath123 , as in ref .",
    "the same applies to network @xmath10 . in other words ,",
    "the number of nodes in the mutually connected giant component belonging to @xmath10 is the same as the number of nodes in the giant connected component of @xmath10 as calculated after the attack as if @xmath10 was a single network .",
    "for the redundant mode , since there is no cascading propagation of damage due to the failure of a neighbor , @xmath119 is the function that describes the probability of picking a node at random , for example from network @xmath9 , which is not connected to the largest component from its own network , network @xmath9 , * and * is not connected to the largest component of network @xmath10 via an out - going link .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath117 provides the fraction of `` active '' nodes , or in other words , the fraction of survival nodes that may be part of the largest component of network @xmath9 , and in addition a fraction from network @xmath9 that are disconnected from that largest component of network @xmath9 , but are not failed because they are still connected to the largest component of network @xmath10 via an out - going link .",
    "thus , the mutually connected giant component @xmath124 has a different structure in this mode compared to the conditional mode .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",

    "thus , the mutually connected giant component contains this node .",
    "furthermore , a node that has lost all its out - going link will fail in the conditional interaction , even if it is still connected to its own giant component .",
    "however , in the redundant mode , a node without out - going links may still function as long as it is still connected to the giant component of its own single network .",
    "for instance , many nodes are still functioning in fig .",

    "[ fig1.fig]b , all stable nodes needs to have out - going links .",
    "that is , in redundant mode , the nodes can still receive power via the same network or the other network , while in the conditional node , they need out - going connectivity all the time . taking into account these considerations ,",
    "the value of @xmath21 is obtained from the behavior of the giant component of either of the networks in the conditional mode , while in the redundant mode , the value of @xmath21 is obtained from the size of the mutually giant connected component .",

    "what follows the calculations of the giant components are done by considering two networks of equal size @xmath125 and damaging each network with a fraction @xmath18 of nodes .",
    "next , we explicitly write the probability functions @xmath126 and @xmath127 for both , conditional and redundant interactions , respectively , to occur on interactive networks after a random failure of @xmath86 and @xmath87 nodes .",
    "it is important to note that the probabilities @xmath126 and @xmath127 describe the probability of randomly choosing a node which is not part of the giant component of one network and/or is not connected to a node from the giant component of the adjacent network . in other words ,",
    "this node picked at random is not part of the giant component of the whole network .",

    "in the case of redundant interaction ( with no cascading due to conditional mode ) these two probabilities are independent , since the lack of connectivity with network @xmath10 does not imply failure of a node from network @xmath9 .",

    "it should be noted that eqs .",
    "( [ alpha.eq ] ) and ( [ beta.eq ] ) may not be self - consistent for all values of @xmath30 .",

    "to better understand these features , consider @xmath173 , and for nodes with @xmath172 and @xmath178 . with this configuration ,",

    "<S> ( ii ) _ some aspects of local function are independent of long - range global interactions with other networks ( as in the redundant interaction ) like the processing of distinct sensory features , while other aspects of local connectivity can be shut - down when connectivity to other networks is shut - down ( as in conditional interaction ) like integrative perceptual processing @xcite . hence , the theory predicts that to assure stability for both modes of dependencies , brain networks ought to be connected with positive and high values of @xmath4 and positive values of @xmath5 .    in the next section </S>",
    "<S> we examine this hypothesis for two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) experiments : human - resting state data obtained from nyu public repository @xcite and human dual - task data @xcite previously used to investigate brain network topology @xcite ( see methods section and si section [ experiments ] for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first identify functional networks ( in resting state , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3.fig]a and dual task , fig . </S>",

    "<S> the indegree distribution of the system of networks follows a bounded power - law ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3.fig]c-d and table [ exp.table ] ) and the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath5 show high positive values for both experiments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3.fig]e-f and table [ exp.table ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to examine whether these values are optimal for the specific @xmath25-parameters of these networks , we projected for each experiment , the measured values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 to the theoretically constructed stability phase diagram quantified by @xmath24 in conditional and redundant mode ( fig .  [ fig4.fig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the experimental values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( white circles ) lie within the relatively narrow region of parameter space that minimizes failure for conditional and redundant interaction . </S>",
    "<S> overall these results demonstrate that brain networks tested under distinct mental states share the topological features that confer stability to the system .    </S>",
    "<S> our result hence provides a theoretical revision to the current view that systems of networks are highly unstable . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for structured networks , if the inter - connections are provided by hubs of the network ( @xmath34 ) and for moderate degrees of convergence of inter - network connection ( @xmath32 ) the systems of network are stable . </S>",
    "<S> this stability holds in the conditional interaction  @xcite and in a more robust topology of redundant interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the redundant condition is equivalent to stating that the system of networks merges in a single network ( in - going and out - going links are treated as the same ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the condition of optimality for this topology equates to saying that the size of the giant component formed by the connection of both networks is optimized . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the maximization of robustness for both conditions is equivalent to maximize _ ( i ) _ robustness in the more conventional conditional interaction , where links of one network are strictly necessary for proper function of the other network , and _ </S>",

    "<S> these parameters form a set of interacting nodes which are maximally large in size and robust to failure .    </S>",
    "<S> the most natural metaphor for man - made system of networks is for electricity ( wires ) and the internet or voice connectivity ( data ) . </S>",
    "<S> a more direct analogue to this case in a living system such as the brain would be the interaction between anatomic , metabolic and vascular networks ( wires ) and their coupling to functional correlations ( data ) @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> instead we adopted the theory of network of networks to investigate the optimality of coupled functional brain modules . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency between experimental data and theoretical predictions even in this broaden notion of coupled networks is suggestive of the possible broad scope of the theory making it a candidate to study a wider range of inter - connected networks @xcite .    * methods *    * experimental analysis . * </S>",
