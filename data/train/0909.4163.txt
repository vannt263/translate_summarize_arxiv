    "last year , the publication of pamela s measurement of the cosmic ray positron fraction ( the ratio of positrons to electrons plus positrons )  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) created a great deal of interest among both cosmic ray astrophysicists and particle physicists .",
    "in particular , pamela observed the positron fraction to rise rapidly with energy , from approximately 5 - 6% at 10 gev , to 10 - 20% by 100 gev . despite uncertainties involved in the predictions of the secondary positron flux ( _ ie .",
    "_  positrons originating from the interactions of cosmic ray protons with the interstellar medium ) , it appears that this result can not be explained without the existence of primary sources of cosmic ray positrons  @xcite .",
    "one possibility that has received a great deal of attention is that these positrons are the products of dark matter annihilations  @xcite or decays  @xcite in the local halo of the milky way .",
    "alternatively , astrophysical sources may also be capable of producing energetic electron - positron pairs .",
    "nearby pulsars , for example , are a particularly promising candidate for the origin of pamela s positron excess  @xcite .",
    "in addition , several experiments have measured the cosmic ray electron ( plus positron ) spectrum over a similar range of energies .",
    "the balloon - based experiment atic reported an electron spectrum which rose rapidly up to approximately 600 gev , at which point it fell suddenly  @xcite .",
    "the spectral feature implied by this result was particularly exciting within the context of dark matter particles which annihilate or decay to monoenergetic electron - positron pairs  @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , the fermi gamma ray space telescope ( fgst ) has reported their measurement of the cosmic ray electron spectrum , and find no evidence for such a sudden feature  @xcite .",
    "the ground - based gamma ray telescope hess has also reported its measurement of the cosmic ray electron spectrum , again failing to confirm the presence of a edge - like feature  @xcite . despite the absense of a sudden edge",
    ", however , the spectrum observed by fgst does contain an overall excess between @xmath1 gev relative to the predictions of simple , homogeneous cosmic ray models .",
    "the rapid rise of the positron fraction observed by pamela requires that the source of these particles produce an extremely hard spectrum . within the context of dark matter",
    ", such particles must produce mostly charged leptons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and/or @xmath4 ) in their decays or annihilations if they are to accommodate this observation  @xcite .",
    "this requirement has been made even more stringent as a result of the fgst electron spectrum measurement , which found the electron spectrum to be only slightly softer than @xmath5 over the range of the pamela positron fraction measurement .",
    "furthermore , dark matter annihilations to non - leptonic final states are tightly constrained by pamela s measurement of the cosmic ray antiproton - to - proton ratio  @xcite , which is consistent with the predictions of cosmic ray models with no exotic or primary antiproton contributions .    following the publication of fgst s cosmic ray electron spectrum measurement , several groups performed studies to determine the range of dark matter masses , cross sections , and annihilation channels that could potentially account for these observations  @xcite . in these studies , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite found that good fits to both the fgst electron spectrum and the pamela positron fraction could be found , but only in the case that the dark matter particles are very heavy ( @xmath6  tev ) , and annihilate / decay to muons or possibly taus .",
    "this conclusion , however , depends critically on the astrophysical backgrounds that are present in the cosmic ray spectrum . as the number of astrophysical sources ( supernova remnants , etc . )",
    "that contribute to the cosmic ray electron spectrum above @xmath7 gev is expected to be small ( of order unity ) , the spectrum observed at the solar system can significantly depart from the time - averaged spectrum as a result of fluctuations in the brightness and spectra of nearby sources .",
    "this makes it very difficult to predict the shape of the relevant background over the range of energies measured by fgst ( and hess ) . in this article",
    ", we revisit the question of what types of annihilating dark matter could potentially account for the positron excess observed by pamela , while remaining consistent with the cosmic ray electron spectrum observed by fgst .",
    "we find that a wide variety of scenarios are consistent with these sets of data , even in cases in which the dark matter mass is well below 1 tev .",
    "in particular , upon relaxing the assumptions pertaining to the cosmic ray electron background , we are able to find excellent fits to both pamela and fgst for dark matter particles annihilating to either @xmath3 or @xmath4 with masses as low as @xmath0300 gev . we also find that when the energy resolution of fgst is taken into account , dark matter particles annihilating to @xmath2 can accommodate the data for masses in the range of approximately 400 to 600 gev .",
    "to calculate the cosmic ray electron / positron spectrum taking into account the effects of diffusion and energy losses , we solve the steady - state propagation equation  @xcite : @xmath8   + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e_e}[b(e_e)\\,\\frac{dn_{e}}{de_{e}}(\\vec{x},e_e ) ] ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the number density of electrons / positrons per unit energy , @xmath10 is the diffusion coefficient , and the source term , @xmath11 , reflects both the distribution of sources and the spectrum that is injected from those sources .",
    "@xmath12 is the energy loss rate of electrons due to synchrotron and inverse compton processes . in the relativistic limit , this rate is related to the radiation field and magnetic field energy densities by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the thompson cross section and @xmath15 is the representative energy loss time . throughout our study , we adopt @xmath16 seconds , which corresponds to a total energy density of approximately 1 ev/@xmath17 .",
    "this density consists of contributions from the cosmic microwave background ( @xmath18 ev/@xmath17 ) , the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath19 ev/@xmath20 ) , and starlight ( @xmath21 ev/@xmath17 ) .    for the diffusion coefficient and diffusion zone boundary conditions , we adopt three sets of parameters that are consistent with all measured stable and unstable secondary - to - primary ratios in the cosmic ray spectrum  @xcite",
    ". we will refer to the following as models a , b and c :    * model a : @xmath22 @xmath23/s ( @xmath24 , @xmath254 kpc * model b : @xmath26 @xmath23/s ( @xmath24 , @xmath251 kpc * model c : @xmath27 @xmath23/s ( @xmath24 , @xmath256 kpc ,    where @xmath28 is the distance above or below the galactic plane at which charged particles are able to freely escape the galactic magnetic field . when fitting the pamela and fgst data with a particular dark matter model , we use the propagation model ( of the above a , b , or c ) that provides the best overall fit .",
    "for the source term , @xmath11 , we adopt an narvarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halo profile  @xcite with a local density of 0.3 gev/@xmath17 .    as charged cosmic rays approach the solar system , the solar wind can cause them to lose energy , distorting their spectrum .",
    "this effect varies with time according to the solar cycle , and has the greatest impact on the lowest energy cosmic rays .",
    "the largest effects of solar modulation are independent of charge ( _ ie . _  they effect electrons and positrons in the same way ) and thus can be removed by considering ratios of different species , such as the positron fraction .",
    "although smaller charge dependent effects of solar modulation do exist , they are significant only below about 5 - 10 gev .",
    "as we only consider the positron fraction as measured above 10 gev in this paper , we can safely neglect the effects of solar modulation on the positron fraction .    to account for the effects of charge independent solar modulation on the cosmic ray electron spectrum",
    ", we estimate the suppression of the electron / positron spectrum using the simple force - field approximation  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this treatment",
    ", we can relate the cosmic ray electron spectrum at earth to that in the interstellar medium by @xmath29 where the subscripts @xmath30 and ism denote quantities at earth , and in the interstellar medium , respectively .",
    "the energies in this expression are related by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the associated potential , sometimes referred to as the solar modulation parameter . as fgst s measurement of the cosmic ray electron spectrum",
    "was conducted near the period of solar minima , we adopt a potential in the range of 650 to 1000 mev , chosen in each case ( within this range ) to provide the best overall fit to the data .",
    "while we acknowledge that the effects of solar modulation on the cosmic ray electron spectrum may be more complicated than can be modelled by this simple and approximate treatment , this approach provides a reasonable estimate that we consider adequate for our purposes .",
    "to begin , we consider the simple case in which dark matter particles annihilate directly to electron - positron pairs . along with the contribution from dark matter , we include a power - law spectrum of electrons from supernova remnants or other such cosmic ray accelerators ( we chose the spectral index and normalization of this background such that we provide the best overall fit in each case ) .",
    "we also include a component of secondary positrons from hadronic interactions with the interstellar medium , given by @xmath33 gev@xmath34 @xmath35 s@xmath34 sr@xmath34 , which is estimated from the observed spectrum of cosmic ray protons and other cosmic ray measurements  @xcite .",
    "when comparing the electron spectrum to the measurements of fgst , we have convolved the spectrum with a gaussian of width approximately given by the energy resolution of fgst ( @xmath36 at 150 gev , increasing to @xmath37 above @xmath38  gev ; see figure 1 of ref .",

    "[ lt100 ] that while such wimps can very nicely accommodate the pamela and fgst data between 10 and 100 gev , very light wimps ( @xmath45 gev ) are not capable , on their own , of accommodating the spectrum observed by fgst at higher energies .",

    ". we will simply refer to this dark matter candidate by the name `` kaluza - klein dark matter '' .",
    "kaluza - klein dark matter particles annihilate largely to charged leptons ( approximately 20 - 23% to each to @xmath72 , @xmath3 and @xmath73 ) , but also annihilate to quark - antiquark pairs a sizeable fraction ( 25 - 35% ) of the time .",

    "in particular , the contribution to the electron - positron spectrum from hadronic final states is less hard from than from charged leptons . to compensate for this",

    ", additional local contributions to the cosmic ray electron spectrum above 100 gev from local sources do not significantly improve the overall fits in this model .",
    "more generally speaking , we can conclude from this example that any 100 - 1000 gev dark matter particle which annihilates to hadronic channels more than @xmath0  @xmath75 of the time will be unable to generate the positron fraction observed by pamela while also providing a consistent fit to the fgst electron spectrum , unless additional primary sources of cosmic ray positrons are also included .    for an alternative kaluza - klein dark matter scenario in which this problem can be evaded , see ref .",

    "this is seen in the top frames of fig .",
    "[ alleeee ] , where we consider the annihilation of dark matter to two 100 mev intermediate states , which each decay to @xmath2 .",
    "the result is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "as we lower the mass of the intermediate state , more of the final state electrons have energies well below the mass of the dark matter particle . in the case shown in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ alleeee ] , this improves the fit to the fgst spectrum by suppressing the flux at @xmath77 gev .",
    "this also softens the positron spectrum over the range of energies measured by pamela , making it more difficult to accommodate the observed positron fraction .",
    "we thus conclude that in the case of dark matter annihilations to @xmath2 , four fermion final states provide only a marginally better fit to the combined data than annihilations to two fermion final states .",
    "in this article , we have studied the possibility that sub - tev dark matter particles annihilating in the galactic halo are responsible for producing the cosmic ray positron fraction observed by pamela , while also remaining consistent with the cosmic ray electron spectrum observed by the fermi gamma ray space telescope ( fgst ) . in our analysis",
    ", we include the possibility that stochastic variations in the local sources of cosmic ray electrons may significantly impact the cosmic ray electron spectrum above @xmath7 gev , and also include the effects of fgst s finite energy resolution . with these considerations taken into account , we find acceptable fits to this combined set of data for wimps as light as @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , dark matter particles annihilating directly to @xmath2 can accommodate the data for masses between approximately 300 and 600 gev , while wimps annihilating to @xmath3 or @xmath4 can provide good fits for masses between approximately 300 and 1000 gev ( and higher ) .",
    "one challenge involved with fitting the pamela and fgst data with sub - tev dark matter is in reconciling the relative hardness of the observed fgst spectrum with the rising positron fraction observed by pamela .",
    "this combination of data implies that the positron signal must be very rapidly rising over the 20 - 100 gev range ( even more rapidly than previously implied by pamela alone ) .",
    "one consequence of this is that the fraction of dark matter annihilations that proceed to non - leptonic states must be very small ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "kaluza - klein dark matter in a minimal model with one universal extra dimension , for example , fails in this regard to accommodate the combined pamela and fgst data .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that dark matter with a wide range of masses below @xmath01 tev , annihilating to charged leptons , can accommodate the rising positron fraction observed by pamela , while remaining consistent with the cosmic ray electron spectrum reported by fgst .",
    "while multi - tev dark matter particles can also provide good fits to this combined set of data  @xcite , the results presented here enable us to continue to contemplate many theoretically attractive scenarios in which the pamela positron fraction results from particle physics associated with the electroweak scale .",
