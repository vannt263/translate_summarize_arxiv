    "markovian processes , both reversible and irreversible , are ubiquitous . microscopic processes , described by the schrdinger equation , are obviously markovian ; and so are many macroscopic processes that can be described by , say , a rate , master , or boltzmann equation .",
    "all these processes share the common feature that they are local in time : the state of the system at any given time fully determines its future evolution , regardless of the system s prior history ; the system exhibits no memory .",
    "this renders markovian processes reproducible , in the sense that preparation of the same initial state  no matter how  always entails the same subsequent evolution .",
    "the ubiquity of markovian processes is linked to the existence of disparate time scales in many systems .",
    "the macroscopic observables whose dynamics one wishes to describe typically coincide with the slow observables , and hence they evolve on longer time scales ; whereas any memory , which is due to interaction with the other , faster degrees of freedom , fades away on a much shorter time scale .",
    "there are situations in which this separation of time scales breaks down and memory effects do play a role @xcite ; but in the present paper , i focus on markovian dynamics .",
    "much effort has been devoted to developing theoretical frameworks that allow one to derive markovian transport equations from the underlying microscopic dynamics ; and in turn , to deduce from these transport equations testable predictions for macroscopic experiments @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this deductive approach , i start here from the opposite end : i ask how one can infer a markovian transport equation _ from experimental data_. in particular , i consider situations where the experimental data come _ without time information_. such data may stem from past processes ( say , in the geological or astronomical realm ) that have left visible traces , albeit without time information ; or from processes that , again , leave visible traces but are so fast or delicate that they can not be tracked with a clock . under such circumstances , before inferring the pertinent markovian equation of motion , one must first reconstruct `` time . ''",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that this is possible ( up to an additive and multiplicative constant ) ; and to furnish the necessary tools for doing so .",
    "the reconstruction of time and of the equation of motion presupposes rather detailed knowledge about the generic structure of markovian dynamics . in particular ,",
    "markovian dynamics may be viewed geometrically as a flow on the manifold of macrostates .",
    "this manifold is endowed with a rich geometric structure , and there are certain consistency conditions that any markovian flow must satisfy . these conditions , in conjunction with the experimental data , will turn out to constrain the form of the equation of motion just enough so that the reconstruction succeeds . mirroring the importance of these _ a priori _ constraints , i start out with a comprehensive discussion of the geometry of macrostates ( sec .",

    "[ generic ] ) .",

    "[ example ] , one observer might be in the rest frame of the experiment , while the other observer moves relative to this frame in the @xmath259 direction ; both observers see the same logarithmic spiral depicted in fig .",
    "[ spiral ] .",
    "their respective reconstructions of time are allowed to differ by an affine transformation .",
    "this provides , in particular , for the possibility that they differ by a lorentz transformation , as demanded by relativity .",
    "the time reconstructed via the above scheme is a _",
    "macroscopic _ time , for it is inferred from experimental data on some coarse - grained level of description .",
    "if the same process is observed on two different levels of description , and if on both levels the process is markovian , then the above procedure can be applied to both sets of data , yielding respective macroscopic times .",
    "one may envision such a situation when one observes , say , a fluid on either the boltzmann or the navier - stokes level of description ; or when one observes a spin system on different coarse - grained length scales , corresponding to varying block spin sizes .",
    "as long as the assumptions spelt out above hold on all these levels of description , the various macroscopic times agree ( up to affine transformations ) .",
    "the inferred time is thus invariant under a change of macroscopic scale , provided that on all scales the dynamics falls within the basic structure of generic markovian dynamics ; and provided that , moreover , on all scales there exists an effective hamiltonian for its non - dissipative part . in this sense ,",
    "the scale invariance of macroscopic time presupposes renormalizability @xcite .    the results in the present paper show that",
    ", in principle , any markovian process can serve as a clock .",
    "absent an external reference clock , one may take an arbitrary , genuinely irreversible markovian process , apply the above reconstruction scheme , and with the help of the inferred equation of motion , mark points on the orbits such that a segment between two successive points corresponds to some fixed time interval .",
    "when the markovian process is repeated , the system evolves along one of the orbits ; and whenever its macrostate reaches one of the designated points , the clock `` ticks . ''",
    "in contrast to everyday clocks , which are based on reversible , periodic motion , such a clock would be based on the irreversibility of the process involved  similar to , e.g. , radiocarbon dating .    conceptually",
    ", one may wonder why a reconstruction of time is necessary at all , and why one does not simply stick to entropy as a proxy for time .",
    "in fact , any strictly monotonic function of time  like entropy in a genuinely irreversible process  serves the purpose of ordering events ; and if such an alternative parameter were adopted universally , it would still be possible to keep appointments .",
    "what distinguishes physical time from all other conceivable parameters is that when expressed as a function of time , equations of motion become particularly simple . as henri poincar put it succinctly @xcite ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ time should be so defined that the equations of mechanics may be as simple as possible .",
    "in other words , there is not one way of measuring time more true than another ; that which is generally adopted is only more _ convenient_. _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    determining physical time is thus tantamount to finding the simplest possible parametrization for the widest possible range of processes ; where `` simplest '' and `` widest '' must be suitably operationalized . on a speculative note , the reconstruction scheme expounded here may be viewed as a proposal for such an operationalization : `` simplicity '' would be embodied in the assumptions summarized in the opening paragraph of this discussion ; whereas `` widest '' would signify the scale invariance alluded to above .",
    "physical time would then be singled out as being a fixed point under changes of scale .",
    "i see several avenues for further research .",
    "first , it will be important to apply the reconstruction scheme to real or simulated experimental data that pertain to more complex , real - world problems .",
