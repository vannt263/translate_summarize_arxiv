    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( l@xmath3 ) have been extensively studied at all wavelengths from the radio to the hard x - rays , in order to unveil the energy source - starburst or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) - responsible for the huge infrared luminosity .",
    "determining the agn role in ulirgs is fundamental to evaluate the contribution of accretion to the infrared background , and to have a complete view of the population of agns in the near universe .",
    "several diagnostics have been proposed for this purpose . in the optical ,",
    "the presence of high - ionization narrow emission lines is an indication of the presence of an agn .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the contribution of the agn to the total luminosity just from the optical emission lines .",
    "hard x - rays are in principle a powerful tool .",
    "the ratio between x - ray and ir emission in starburst - dominated ulirgs is expected to be @xmath4 , while in agn - dominated ulirgs the ratio is @xmath5 ( risaliti et al .",
    "however , if the agn is covered by a column density n@xmath6 higher than 10@xmath7  @xmath8 , the presence of the agn and its total luminosity are hard to determine . in general , all these methods are useful when they can directly measure the agn luminosity , but they fail in determining whether an agn is present or not in case of a nondetection .    mid - infrared spectroscopy provides a powerful way to disentangle the starburst and agn contribution .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules emission lines as an indicator of starburst activity in iso spectra of the brightest ulirgs .",
    "since pah molecules are destroyed by the x - ray radiation emitted by agns , a high equivalent width ( ew ) of pah lines is an indicator of the absence of a strong agn .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the ew of the pah emission feature at @xmath9 m as main diagnostics , and concluded that most ulirgs are starburst - dominated .",
    "recently imanishi & dudley ( 2000 ) showed that ground - based telescopes can provide similarly good -or probably better- data for this kind of diagnostics .",
    "in particular , l - band spectroscopy of low redshift ulirgs allows the direct measurement of the @xmath10 m pah feature ( indicator of starburst activity , similarly to the 7.7  @xmath0 m feature ) and of the carbonaceous dust absorption dip at @xmath11 m ( indication of an absorbed point source like an agn ) .",
    "most importantly , the l - band is wide enough for a correct estimate of the continuum level , needed to measure both the equivalent width of the pah feature and the detection of the carbon dip . in this way",
    "imanishi et al . ( 2001 ) and imanishi & maloney ( 2003 ) clearly discovered signatures of an agn dominating the energy output in ugc 5101 , which was previously classified as starburst - dominated using iso spectra only .",
    "the ulirg iras 19254 - 7245 ( the _ superantennae _ , mirabel , lutz & maza 1991 ) is optically classified as a seyfert 2 .",
    "iso mid - infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of an agn in iras 19254 - 7245 , but it does not provide a clear indication on which is the dominant energy source , the ew of the 7.7  @xmath0 m pah feature being intermediate between typical agn and typical starburst values ( genzel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "recently charmandaris et al .",
    "( 2002 ) classified the source as agn - dominated , based on the same iso data .",
    "xmm - newton data in the 2 - 10 kev band suggests that iras 19254 - 7245 is agn - dominated ( braito et al .",
    "the x - ray spectrum suggests that the source is compton - thick , i.e. the absorbing column density is higher than 10@xmath12  @xmath8 .",
    "the total luminosity of the agn is estimated to be of the order or higher than 10@xmath13  ergs  s@xmath14 .",
    "berta et al .",
    "( 2003 ) fitted the sed of iras 19254 - 7245 from the u to the mm - band , with a starburst+agn model , estimating a contribution of the agn to the bolometric luminosity of 40 - 50% .    here",
    "we present an l - band spectrum of iras 19254 - 7245 , obtained with the instrument isaac on the vlt as part of a mini - survey of bright ulirgs .",
    "thanks to the superb quality of both the telescope and the instrument , this is probably the best l - band spectrum of a ulirg ever published , and shows the potentiality of ground - based l - band spectroscopy in the study of active and star forming galaxies .",
    "iras 19254 - 7245 is a system consisting of two colliding spiral galaxies , at z=0.062 .",
    "the separation of the two nuclei is 8.5  ( @xmath15  kpc=75 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 . ] ) .",
    "the southern galaxy is classified as a seyfert 2 ( mirabel et al . 1991 ) , while the northern galaxy shows an optical spectrum typical of starbursts ( colina , lipari & macchetto 1991 ) . at 2  @xmath0 m ,",
    "the southern galaxy is brighter by @xmath161 magnitude than the northern galaxy ( duc , mirabel & maza 1997 ) .",
    "images at 10  @xmath0 m show that the mid - ir emission is concentrated in the nuclei , and the southern one is more than @xmath165 times brighter than the northern one .",
    "finally , isocam observations ( charmandaris et al . 2002 ) show that more than 90% of the 5 - 20  @xmath0 m emission is due to the southern source .",
    "we performed 2 observations of iras 19254 - 7245 with isaac - vlt , on june 02 , 2002 , and on june 3 , 2002 .",
    "each observation was 1 hour long .",
    "the two nights were photometric , and the seeing was around 1  . in the image acquired before the spectroscopic observation , we detected the two nuclei and we oriented the 1  slit in order to obtain spectra of both .",
    "however , the northern nucleus turned out to be too faint to obtain a useful spectrum .",
    "therefore , we will not discuss it further .",
    "the spectroscopic observations have been performed in `` chopping '' mode , with single exposures of 0.56 sec .",
    "the data were merged , flat - fielded and sky - subtracted using standard procedures in the iraf package . a spectrum of the spectrophotometric standard star hip 183 ( b4iii , l=5.5 , t@xmath17=15,800 k ) was acquired in the same way for both observations , and used to obtain the instrumental response , in order to correct the source spectrum .",
    "since the calibration lamp lines were too faint to be useful , the wavelength calibration was performed using the nominal instrumental range and the wavelength of the carbon absorption features ( as described in the next section ) . throughout this paper",
    "we always refer to rest frame wavelengths , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the absolute flux calibration has been obtained analyzing the profile of the star along the slit , and estimating the fraction of flux inside the slit , assuming a perfect centering .",
    "we estimate that this procedure has an error of the order of 10% .",
    "we checked that the two final spectra were consistent , and we finally merged the results of the two observations .",
    "the final spectrum , rebinned by a factor of 5 , is shown in fig .",
    "the error bars are estimated from the poissonian noise in the sky counts ( which are by far the dominant source of noise ) .",
    "previous optical and infrared observations indicated the presence of an agn in the nucleus of iras 19254 - 7245 , but the relative importance of the agn and starburst components was not clear : the 7.7  @xmath0 m pah feature detected by iso ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) has an intermediate strength ( s=0.8 , where s is the ratio between the peak 7.7  @xmath0 m flux and the continuum at the same wavelength ) with respect to pure starbursts and pure agn ( s@xmath163.6 and s@xmath160.04 respectively , genzel et al .",
    "however , the determination of the continuum level is highly uncertain in the isophot spectra , due to the presence of absorption features and the poor signal - to - noise ratio . in the optical and near - ir",
    ", the presence of an agn is clearly revealed from the high [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio and from the presence of strong coronal lines ( vanzi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the isaac spectrum presented here is probably the highest s / n l - band spectrum of a ulirg so far .",
    "thanks to the high signal and to the moderately high spectral resolution , the starburst and agn indicators can be studied with unprecedented detail .",
    "the signatures of the agn activity in the l - band spectrum of iras 19254 - 7245 are quite clear : 1 ) the deep absorption at @xmath19 m ( rest frame ) strongly suggesting the presence of a point source behind a screen of dusty gas ; 2 ) the pah feature at 3.3  @xmath0 m with a much lower equivalent width than typical starburst - dominated sources ; 3 ) the rather steep continuum slope above @xmath20 m , suggesting the presence of warm , agn - heated dust .",
    "we discuss each of these points in the following .",
    "the broad absorption feature at @xmath19 m ( rest frame ) is present in the spectra of many agns and ulirgs ( imanishi & dudley 2000 , imanishi 2000 ) .",
    "we clearly detected such feature in the spectrum of iras  19254 - 7245 , with an optical depth @xmath21 .",
    "the absorption is believed to be due to c - h stretching vibration in hydrocarbon dust grains ( sandford et al .",
    "1991 and references therein ) .",
    "imanishi & maloney ( 2003 ) showed that an optical depth of this feature @xmath22 higher than @xmath23 requires a centrally - concentrated source , i.e. an agn , unless dust absorption in the host galaxy is significant .",
    "indeed , absorption features at 3.4  @xmath0 m are commonly observed in agns ( imanishi 2000 ) while they are never found in galaxies known to be dominated by starburst .",
    "since the same dust grains are present in the galactic interstellar medium , the most detailed studies of the 3.4  @xmath0 m absorption have been done on galactic center sources ( sandford et al .",
    "1991 , pendelton et al .",
    "1994 ) . in these cases the high statistics available",
    "allows to resolve the substructure of the absorption feature in at least two major components , due to -ch@xmath24 and -ch@xmath25 groups , respectively . in fig .",
    "2b we plot the ratio between the observed spectrum and the continuum shown in fig . 1",
    ", obtained with a polynomial fit of the regions with observed wavelengths in the ranges 2.9 - 3.1  @xmath0 m , 3.3 - 3.5  @xmath0 m , 3.8 - 4.1  @xmath0 m . a similar spectrum of the galactic center source irs7 from pendelton et al .",
    "1994 is plotted in fig .",
    "the similarity between the two profiles is remarkable , and suggests a similar composition of the carbonaceous dust grains .",
    "a deblending of the single absorption components is quite uncertain : at least three components are present at rest frame wavelengths of 3.38 , 3.42 and 3.485  @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "2 ) . moreover , the absorbed continuum is blended with the long wavelength tail of the pah emission feature at 3.3  @xmath0 m .",
    "a qualitative analysis is possible comparing our data with those of the source irs 7 . following sandford et al .",
    "( 1991 ) the absorption features at 3.38  @xmath0 m and at 3.42  @xmath0 m are due to -ch@xmath25 and -ch@xmath24 groups , respectively , in saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons .",
    "the ratio between the two absorption peaks is an indication of the average length of hydrocarbon chains-(ch@xmath26-ch@xmath25 , therefore the ratio between the strength of -ch@xmath25 and -ch@xmath24 absorption features is a direct measure of @xmath27 . ] .",
    "since the relative strength of the two features in iras 19254 - 7245 is compatible within the errors with those in irs  7 , the average ratio between -ch@xmath24 and -ch@xmath25 groups is the same , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this corresponds to relatively complex molecules made of 6 - 7 carbon atoms .",
    "the third absorption feature is due to the same c - h stretching vibrations , when the -ch@xmath24 and ch@xmath25 groups are perturbed by an electronegative group , such as -c@xmath29n , -oh , or aromatic chains .",
    "the higher depth of this feature in iras 19254 - 7245 with respect to the galactic source irs  7 indicates that the absorbing medium in iras 19254 - 7245 is rich of organic molecules with such electronegative groups ( see fig . 7 in sandford et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the broad emission feature at 3.3  @xmath0 m is due to polycyclic aromathic hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "it has been empirically shown that this emission feature is weak or absent in agns , while is strong in starbursts ( roche et al .",
    "this is probably due to the destruction of pah molecules by the strong x - ray and euv emission of agns , and to the dilution of the continuum stellar component . as a consequence , a low equivalent width ( ew ) of the 3.3",
    "@xmath0 m emission feature is an indicator of agn emission .",
    "typical ew for starburst galaxies are in the range 1000 - 1500    ( moorwood 1986 , imanishi & dudley 2000 ) , while in agn - dominated sources ew @xmath30100 - 300    ( imanishi 2002 ) .",
    "the estimated value for iras 19254 - 7245 is ew=120@xmath31   , suggesting that the emission is dominated by the active nucleus .",
    "we emphasize that the broad spectral range is crucial for a correct estimate of the ew .",
    "in particular , if the continuum at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath32 m is not available , the line flux is easily over - estimated , while the continuum at 3.4  @xmath0 m is under - estimated because of the broad 3.4  @xmath0 m absorption feature .",
    "to illustrate this fact , we tried to fit the rest - frame 3.0 - 3.7  @xmath0 m spectrum with a simple power law and an emission line , and we obtained an equivalent width of 700   , in the range typical of starburst - dominated sources . another possible source of uncertainty in the measurement of the 3.3  @xmath0 m feature ew is the overlap with the 3.4  @xmath0 m absorption feature .",
    "however , the 3.3  @xmath0 m emission line appears to be symmetric with respect its peak wavelength ( which is exactly at 3.3  @xmath0 m ) , and the absorption feature in the comparison source in fig .",
    "2a does not extend below @xmath33 m .",
    "we conclude that the 3.3  @xmath0 m pah feature is not significantly affected by the absorption at 3.4  @xmath0 m .",
    "it is possible to use the measurement of the 3.3 pah line to estimate the agn / starburst contribution to the infrared emission .",
    "an interesting indicator is the ratio between the flux of the 3.3  @xmath0 m feature , @xmath34 , and the total far infrared flux , f@xmath35 , as estimated from the four iras filters ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the typical value for starburst galaxies is @xmath36 , while in agn - dominated sources @xmath37 is more than 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower ( imanishi 2002 ) . for iras 19254 - 7245",
    "we have f@xmath38 erg  @xmath8  s@xmath14 and f@xmath39 erg  @xmath8  s@xmath14 . as a consequence , @xmath40 .",
    "this indicator suggests that the detected starburst can account for only a small fraction of the infrared luminosity of iras  19254 - 7245 .",
    "a direct way to obtain a rough quantitative estimate of the agn contribution to the infrared luminosity is to subtract a starburst template from the l - band spectrum , and then compare the l - band flux @xmath41 with the total far infrared flux @xmath42 as measured by iras .",
    "we expect that in case of agn dominance these two fluxes are @xmath16 equal .",
    "we assumed that the pah emission is entirely due to the starburst , and that the starburst continuum is reproduced by a flat ( @xmath43const ) spectrum normalized in order to have ew@xmath44=1000  (in agreement with starburst spectra in imanishi & dudley 2000 ) .",
    "the resulting `` pure agn '' spectrum is steeper ( @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47  erg  s@xmath14  @xmath8 . assuming the galactic extinction curve of pendelton et al .",
    "1994 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the extinction in the l - band ) , we obtain @xmath51 . correcting the observed 3  @xmath0 m flux for this extinction we end up with @xmath52 .",
    "this result is an indication that the agn is dominant in the ir , and that the extinction curve in the _ superantennae _ is probably quite different from the galactic one .",
    "the slope of the continuum at wavelengths @xmath1 m is rather steep ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this suggests a strong emission by warm dust , typical of agn spectra ( granato , danese & francecshini 1997 ) .",
    "interestingly , analyzing the 3 - 4  @xmath0 m spectra of ulirgs available in the literature we note that a positive slope in the 3.5 - 4.0  @xmath0 m continuum is only found in agn - dominated sources .",
    "the opposite is not true : a few sources exist ( mkn 231 , ngc 6240 ) with negative 3.5 - 4.0  @xmath0 m slope , which are known to host a powerful agn from observations at other wavelengths .",
    "this issue will be discussed in further detail in a forthcoming paper ( risaliti et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) . at @xmath53",
    "m an inversion of the slope is clearly seen . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the l - band spectrum with the near - ir spectrum obtained at the ntt ( vanzi et al . 2002 ) and the isocam point at 6  @xmath0 m ( laurent et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the extrapolation of the continuum matches well both the k spectrum and the 6  @xmath0 m point .",
    "this shows that the three observations are well cross - calibrated , and our flux calibration error is lower than @xmath165% .",
    "the minimum in the l - band spectrum , at @xmath163.1  @xmath0 m is the absolute minimum in the optical - infrared spectrum of iras 19254 - 7245 . at shorter wavelengths",
    "the emission is dominated by radiation from the host galaxy , since the agn is highly obscured- , while at longer wavelengths the radiation is mainly due to the reprocessing of the agn direct emission .",
    "imanishi & maloney ( 2003 ) detected a broad absorption feature at 3.1  @xmath0 m in several ulirgs , due to ice - covered dust grains . in principle",
    "we can not exclude that the minimum observed at 3.1  @xmath0 m is partly due to this effect .",
    "however , we note that if a significant fraction of carbonaceous dust grains are covered by ice , they do not contribute to the 3.4  @xmath0 m absorption .",
    "this would imply that the optical extinction @xmath54 for a given @xmath55 is even higher than that assumed in sect",
    "if this is the case , the correction to the observed 3  @xmath0 m continuum would also be higher , worsening the problem of the too high 3  @xmath0 m flux compared with the fir emission .",
    "we presented a high signal - to - noise l - band spectrum of the ultra - luminous infrared galaxy iras 19254 - 7245 .",
    "the signatures of a powerful agn dominating the energy output in the infrared are clear : + @xmath56 the broad absorption feature at @xmath19 m , suggests the presence of a powerful point source .",
    "the substructure of this feature shows that the absorption is due to hydrocarbon molecules consisting of chains of 6 - 7 carbon atoms , rich in electronegative groups , as -cn , -oh . + @xmath56 the ew of the pah emission feature at 3.3  @xmath0 m , when the continuum is correctly estimated taking into account the broad absorption at 3.4  @xmath0 m , is typical of agn - dominated sources .",
    "+ @xmath56 the continuum at @xmath1 m is rather steep , indicating the presence of hot dust . +",
    "the above conclusions show the potential of high signal - to - noise l - band spectroscopic observations with vlt - isaac . we are now completing a work in which we extend the present study to a sample of 6 more bright ulirgs of the genzel et al .",
