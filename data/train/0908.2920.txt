    "cubic perovskites @xmath7 with random occupation of the @xmath8 site form a special class of ferroelectrics . in these materials",
    "the dielectric permittivity has a maximum around @xmath9 that is not associated with any structural phase transition . because the maximum of the dielectric constant is broad in temperature and",
    "also depends on the frequency , these materials are called `` relaxor ferroelectrics '' . pb@xmath10o@xmath11 ( @xmath12=zn , mg ; @xmath12=nb , ta ) are typical relaxor ferroelectrics . to explain the broad maximum in the dielectric permittivity it was proposed by smolenskii  @xcite that fluctuations in @xmath13 ions lead to a coexistence of polar and non - polar regions in these materials as the temperature is reduced",
    ". later burns  @xcite used the same approach to explain the temperature dependence of the refraction index that polar regions of nanometer size ( pnr ) form below a characteristic temperature , which for pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath11 ( pmn ) is @xmath14  k.    extensive studies of the phonons in relaxor ferroelectrics by inelastic neutron scattering were unable to identify the soft mode that together with the lyddane - sachs - teller relationship would explain the temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity . recently",
    ", however , it was shown that a quasi - elastic mode appears below the burns temperature in pmn whose intensity increases with decreasing temperature and reaches a maximum at @xmath15  380  k  @xcite .",
    "the slow fluctuations associated with this scattering correspond to atomic motions correlated over a few unit cells only .",
    "in addition there is strictly elastic diffuse intensity in pmn that appears at @xmath15  420  k and indicates that static domains develop below that temperature  @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the diffuse scattering increases with decreasing temperature and saturates below @xmath15  100  k. these findings are in accord with a model of slowly fluctuating polar nano - regions in relaxor ferroelectrics that freeze with decreasing temperatures but do not undergo a phase transition to a long - range ferroelectric state due to the random - fields  @xcite .    because the size of the polar nano - regions does not exceed a few hundreds ngstrms , these give rise to the presence of diffuse scattering in both x - ray and neutron spectra .",
    "the distribution of the diffuse scattering in reciprocal space was investigated by many groups .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the diffuse scattering in pmn is predominantly transverse to the scattering vector @xmath16 and that the intensity is weak near bragg peaks with even parity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the distribution of diffuse scattering from pbzn@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2-pbtio@xmath11 using x - ray techniques and found that in the ( h , k,0 ) plane the diffuse intensity consists either of elongated streaks perpendicular to the scattering vector @xmath16 ( e.g. around ( 1,1,0 ) ) or has the shape of a `` butterfly '' ( e.g. around ( 1,0,0 ) ) .",
    "although there is still no complete understanding of the shape and size of the pnr in relaxor ferroelectrics , it has been recognized that it is mainly correlated pb - ions displacements that produce the diffuse scattering and are at the origin of the polar nano - regions  @xcite .",
    "while the direction of the pb - displacements is difficult to obtain unambiguously from powder diffraction measurements , the average amplitude of the atomic displacements generally agrees with the results of modeling the diffuse - scattering .",
    "for example early powder neutron diffraction measurements from pmn by bonneau _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that pb ions are displaced from the ( 0,0,0 ) position below @xmath15800  k and that the magnitude of these displacements increases with decreasing temperature . at t=5",
    "k the pb ions are statistically displaced by @xmath18   along the @xmath19 directions .",
    "the probability density function of pb in pmn was determined  @xcite and it is found that while at room temperature pb is isotropically displaced , the pb potential has a double - well shape at low temperature .",
    "pbmg@xmath0ta@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pmt ) is a typical relaxor ferroelectric . as for pmn",
    "the average crystal structure is cubic at all temperatures .",
    "the real part of the dielectric permittivity has a maximum at @xmath15170  k and at a frequency of @xmath20=10  khz .",
    "powder neutron diffraction  @xcite has shown that the amplitude of the pb displacements grows rapidly below the burns temperature that is @xmath21  k for pmt  @xcite .",
    "the pb - displacements give rise to neutron diffuse scattering whose temperature dependence correlates with the temperature dependence of the atomic displacements well . because of the similarities existing between the physical properties of pmt with those of pmn and pbzn@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pzn ) , we decided to investigate the detailed atomic structure by neutron and synchrotron radiation . the diffuse scattering of pmt in the [ h,0,0]/[0,k,0 ] plane is transverse to the scattering vector for the ( h , h,0 ) bragg reflections and has a butterfly - shape near the ( h,0,0 ) peaks . in the [ h , h,0]/[0,0,l ] plane",
    "the diffuse scattering of pbmg@xmath0ta@xmath1o@xmath2 is elongated along @xmath3 directions which indicates that the motion of the pb ions have a short correlation length along that direction .    in the following",
    "we will denote @xmath22 the general momentum transfer vector ( @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the scattering angle and @xmath25 the incident wavelength ) .",
    "the reciprocal lattice vectors will be denoted by @xmath26 , and the relative momentum transfer vector by @xmath27 .",
    "we performed a high - quality neutron single crystal experiment from a pmt sample on d9 at ill .",
    "the diffractometer is located on the hot source and allows access to bragg reflections at large @xmath28 values .",
    "the short neutron wavelength of 0.513   , combined with the small crystal size ( @xmath29  mm ) helped also to minimize extinction problems .",
    "bragg intensities were collected at @xmath30  k and @xmath31  k , respectively . at room temperature 632 reflections were measured up to @xmath32  @xmath33 and 612 ( @xmath34  @xmath33 ) at @xmath35=20 k , with maximum miller index 11 .",
    "a symmetry test showed that the crystal symmetry is cubic at both temperatures , r@xmath36=3.35% for the 300  k data set and r@xmath36=5.92% at 20  k.    the cubic symmetry describes the average periodic structure only .",
    "atomic displacements break this symmetry locally , however the global symmetry is retained through the formation of domains .",
    "so , pmt must be described as a perturbed periodic structure . whereas the aim of this paper is to clarify the nature of the perturbation , the diffraction data contain information about the size of the displacements that will be used as a constraint for the analysis of the diffuse scattering patterns . to analyze the atomic displacements we used the patterson function @xmath37 that is calculated through the fourier transform of the observed bragg intensities : @xmath38 where @xmath26 are the bragg reflections , @xmath39 the relevant observed intensities , @xmath40 the scattering density and @xmath41 is the unit cell volume . in order to properly set the zero of @xmath37",
    "the value of @xmath42 - calculated on the same scale after the structure refinement below described - has been added to the list of the observed intensities .",
    "[ patterson ] shows that the patterson function is the self - convolution of the scattering density , so the position of the peaks in @xmath43 gives direct access to the interatomic distances @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "cuts through the patterson maps across the main interatomic peaks are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the most pronounced characteristic in the cut through the patterson map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is visible in the pb - b interatomic peaks . at room temperature",
    "the pb - b average length is @xmath452.5   with a distribution of @xmath450.3   . at low temperature",
    "the pb - b length shows a maximum away from the expected distance in the perovskite structure . as b - o peaks",
    "do not show anything similar , we must attribute this feature to displacements of pb atoms from their average position . at room temperature",
    "the pb atoms lie in a spherical region about their nominal positions . at @xmath30",
    "k , the pb displacements are more defined and pb atoms lie on an isotropic spherical shell .",
    "this can be described by a 3-d double - well - shaped potential defining the pb displacements .",
    "moreover , a least - square fit to the diffraction data was done using the programs `",
    "jana2000 `  @xcite .",
    "the refined atomic parameters are summarized in table i. in agreement with the analysis of vakhrushev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for pmn , the structural refinement at @xmath30  k indicates simultaneous displacements of the pb ions along all directions by 0.34(2) .",
    "the displacements of the o ions are modeled by anisotropic temperature factors .",
    "the result of the refinement gives that the o thermal ellipsoids have a larger component in the @xmath46-plane .",
    "we also observe that the oxygen - related patterson peaks increase and get sharper with increasing temperature , which is direct evidence for the anomalous decrease of the thermal displacement parameters of the oxygen atoms observed in a previous powder diffraction experiment  @xcite .",
    "so , while we can not disregard the possibility of o displacements correlated with the pb displacements , this is not a dominant feature .",
    "we could not obtain from the diffraction evidence about the anisotropy of the displacements , although the spatial resolution would be in principle sufficient for this purpose .",
    "we attribute this limitation to either the averaging over many symmetry - equivalent pnr domains or to a large fraction of thick domain walls ( or non - polar regions  @xcite ) between pnr , that are not ordered .",
    "furthermore even in ordered pnr the displacements are only broadly collinear .",
    "however , the results obtained from the diffraction data allow us to restrict the analysis of the diffuse scattering to pb displacements only .",
    "the diffuse scattering was measured in a single crystal of pmt at the swiss - norwegian beam line ( snbl ) at the esrf .",
    "the measurements were performed in transmission geometry with the wavelength @xmath47   in a broad temperature range between @xmath48  k and 450  k. systematic maps of scattered intensity were collected by a mar-345 imaging plate detector with the single crystal being rotated in steps of 0.5@xmath49 around the vertical axis . from this data the distribution of the diffuse intensity in the [ h,0,0]/[0,k,0 ] and [ h , h,0]/[0,0,l ] scattering planes could be reconstructed , using the program by oxford diffraction to merge the measured maps .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the reconstruction of the scattered intensity distribution in the [ h,0,0]/[0,k,0 ] and [ h , h,0]/[0,0,l ] scattering planes at @xmath50  k. as known from previous neutron measurements , diffuse scattering is particularly strong at this temperature .",
    "the diffuse scattering in pmt has a similar `` butterfly''-shaped distribution as found in pmn around the ( 2,0,0 ) bragg reflection and within the [ h,0,0]/[0,k,0 ] scattering plane as shown in fig .",
    "it can be observed that the diffuse scattering is elongated along the four equivalent @xmath51 directions around these zone centers , while the diffuse scattering is essentially transverse to the scattering vector @xmath16 around the ( 2,2,0 ) bragg peak . comparing these measurements with the diffuse scattering obtained",
    "when the single crystal is aligned in the [ h , h,0]/[0,0,l ] plane shows firstly that the diffuse scattering is extended along the @xmath3 directions around the ( 2,0,0 ) bragg peak .",
    "secondly , it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b the diffuse scattering around the ( 2,2,0 ) bragg peak has four wings of intensity that extend along the @xmath3 directions and no diffuse intensity is visible along the @xmath51 directions .",
    "this last observation shows that the intensity of the diffuse scattering depends on the direction of the atomic displacements relative to the orientation of the scattering vector @xmath16 .",
    "the same effect was observed in pmn  @xcite , where the diffuse scattering was modeled by introducing a polarization factor of the form @xmath52 .",
    "although this polarization factor has the same form as for phonon scattering , it is also present in the cross - section for diffuse x - ray and neutron scattering if atoms are displaced from the average position in the unit cell . in the latter case ,",
    "the diffuse intensity varies like @xmath52 with @xmath53 the direction of the atomic displacements  @xcite .",
    "it is this polarization factor that causes the absence of the diffuse intensity when the displacement disorder is perpendicular to the scattering vector @xmath16 as we observe for pmt in the vicinity of the ( 1,1,0 ) bragg peak . as the diffuse scattering in pmt at low temperatures",
    "was found to be truly elastic from neutron diffraction measurements  @xcite , it must originate from static random displacements , rather than from the condensation of a transverse optic phonon mode .",
    "to analyze the diffuse scattering in pmt we introduce a model that takes into account the shape of the polar nanoregions as well as the direction and amplitude of the displacements .",
    "we define therefore a shape function @xmath54 for a pnr .",
    "the autocorrelation function @xmath55 of @xmath54 is @xmath56 and its fourier transform @xmath57 for the case of a periodic crystal of limited dimensions described by @xmath54 , the diffracted intensity is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the structure amplitude of one unit cell and @xmath60 the scattering density of atom @xmath61 ; @xmath62 is a reciprocal lattice vector .    for a disordered crystal",
    "the scattering density @xmath63   can be decomposed into an average atomic density @xmath64 and a random density @xmath65 , so that the atomic distribution in the crystal is described by @xmath66 .",
    "the average atomic structure contributes to the bragg reflections and its scattered intensity is vanishingly small away from the reciprocal lattice vectors . in that case",
    "it is justified to neglect interference effects and to make the assumption that @xmath67 . in this approximation",
    "the total scattered intensity consists of the superposition of bragg peaks with broad diffuse components centered around the lattice reciprocal vectors .",
    "the diffuse scattering measured in pmt was modeled by assuming that only the pb ion is displaced from its average position ( @xmath68 in the @xmath69 space group ) .",

    "the cubic unit cell of pmt contains only one ion ( pb ) that is displaced from its average site , the form factor of the diffuse intensity reduces to @xmath72=4b^2_{pb}\\sin^2 ( { \\bm q}\\cdot{\\bm u}/2 ) .",

    "[ vec ] is @xmath74 which is the form used in refs .  .",
    "it is instructive to give here the @xmath16-dependence of the diffuse scattering when pb ions in the _ average _ structure are located on a spherical shell of radius @xmath75 , _ i.e. _ @xmath76 as suggested by neutron diffraction in both pmn refs   and pmt ( _ cf .",

    "finally it should be pointed out that the dependence of the diffuse intensity in the case of atomic displacements differs from huang scattering that arises for small concentrations of defects . in this case",
    ", the displacements distribution has spherical symmetry around a defect and the scattering is proportional to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the angle between @xmath16 and the wave - vector @xmath81 .",
    "huang scattering is present around all bragg reflections and its intensity is enhanced along the scattering vector @xmath82 while the diffuse intensity vanishes when @xmath83 .",
    "inspection of the diffuse scattering measured in pmt at @xmath50  k shows that the planes of zero intensity are not always perpendicular to @xmath16 .",
    "for example fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the diffuse scattering measured in pmt around the ( 1,1,0 ) bragg position with the crystal being oriented with an @xmath84 $ ] axis vertical is elongated in the direction transverse to the scattering vector and is zero along @xmath16 .",
    "both results are contrary to what would be expected for huang scattering .",
    "we note that it was found that weak diffuse scattering is still present in pmn above the burns temperature , with , however , a different distribution of intensity in reciprocal space . at high temperature",
    "this residual diffuse scattering could mainly arise from huang scattering and the chemical disorder on the b - site . on the other hand correlated atomic displacements , which give rise to the strong diffuse scattering ,",
    "disappear above the burns temperature  @xcite .",
    "the line - shape of the diffuse scattering depends upon the shape function @xmath85 that describes the form and the size of the polar nanoregions . in the simplest assumption ,",
    "if pb displacements were to be perfectly aligned within any sharply defined geometric region , there would be characteristic intensity modulations , which have not been observed .",
    "moreover , monte - carlo simulations of the diffuse scattering in pmn have shown that the domain wall structure of the polar nanoregions is complicated  @xcite which makes it difficult to describe the shape - function with a simple analytical function .",
    "however , the autocorrelation of the shape @xmath55 can be described by an analytical function .",
    "in fact , shape in this case is defined in a stochastic way .",
    "hereafter we choose to describe @xmath55 by decaying exponentials with an anisotropic decay length .",
    "depending on the detailed symmetry of the decay length , this leads to power - law decay of the diffuse scattering .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated in pmn that the line - shape of the diffuse scattering generally follows a @xmath86-dependence , with @xmath87 and weakly depending on @xmath35 , becoming higher at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "others ( chetverikov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that @xmath88 varies between 1.5 and 2.6 as a function of the temperature .",
    "the `` pancake '' model of xu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite assumes that pnr have cylindrical symmetry , which yields an exponent @xmath89 along the axis , @xmath90 in the orthogonal plane , and higher along general directions  @xcite . in the following we will assume a more general ( orthorhombic ) anisotropy of the autocorrelation function , keeping its exponential character : @xmath91 @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 correspond then to the average dimensions of the polar nanoregions along the mutually orthogonal directions defined by the unit vectors @xmath95 ( i=1,2,3 ) , @xmath96 is an inessential constant .",
    "this is consistent with power - law decay with @xmath97 along special directions ( @xmath98 in general ) .",
    "in order to model the diffuse scattering in pmt , the direction of the static displacements has to be known .",
    "there is however no consensus about the direction of the pb displacement in the literature . in xu s analysis  @xcite of the diffuse scattering in pmn ,",
    "the polarization ( displacement ) direction is parallel to @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast using neutron scattering and a pair distribution function analysis , jeong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found direct evidence that displacements in pmn have rhombohedral symmetry , which suggests that the pb atoms are displaced along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "initially we assume that ionic displacements @xmath53 are along the @xmath5 equivalent directions , and choose the unit vectors that define the dimensions of the pnr as @xmath99=[1,1,0]/@xmath100 , @xmath101=[1,-1,0]/@xmath100 and @xmath102=[0,0,1 ] , respectively . in this model ,",
    "there are six domains which correspond to the symmetrically equivalent @xmath51 directions in the cubic structure . when @xmath103 , the model is equivalent to the `` pancake '' model of the pnr of ref .",
    "this model accounts properly for the distribution of the diffuse scattering in pmt in the ( 1,0,0 ) brillouin zones with @xmath104 perpendicular to the scattering plane when @xmath10520   and @xmath106  100   . in the [ h , h,0]/[0,0,l ] scattering plane",
    ", the diffuse scattering has the shape of a `` butterfly '' with wings along the @xmath4 directions that is reproduced by the calculations .",
    "we find , however , that this model does not reproduce the distribution of diffuse scattering intensities around the ( 2,2,2 ) bragg peak properly .",
    "in fact , the measurements clearly show that diffuse scattering is mainly transverse to the scattering vector @xmath107 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , while this model yields additional streaks along @xmath107 that can not be eliminated alone by adjusting the correlation lengths .",
    "we then concluded that the transverse streak is cancelled because of the form factor @xmath108 .",
    "in addition , inspection of the diffuse intensity map in pmt reveals that in the [ h , h,0]/[0,0,l ] scattering plane the streaks of diffuse scattering around the ( 0,0,l ) bragg peaks are extended along the @xmath109 directions which indicates that the length of the polar nanoregions must be short along these directions .",
    "the simplest way of building pnr with e.g. a short @xmath6 extension is to choose @xmath110 $ ] , @xmath101=@xmath111 $ ] and @xmath102=@xmath112[1,1,-2 ] .",
    "in this case there are 12 possible pnr domains that will contribute to the patterns of diffuse intensity .",
    "the diffuse scattering distribution was calculated for displacements @xmath53 along these directions and the best agreement between observed and calculated diffuse intensity patterns could be obtained by choosing @xmath113 along @xmath4 . for the other directions of atomic displacements the distribution of intensity wings around some of the bragg peaks were incorrect .    in the previous section we showed that the model with the pb determined the direction of the most probable pb - displacements in pmt as @xmath4 , the dimensions of the parallelepiped could be estimated from the width of the diffuse intensity away from the bragg peaks . at @xmath50",
    "k , a reasonable estimation yields @xmath10550   ; @xmath11430   and @xmath1154   .",
    "calculated diffuse scattering maps are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b and can be compared with the experimental data presented in fig .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * patterson analysis provides direct evidence that the potential at pb sites develops a double - well structure at low temperature causing pb ions to be distributed on a shell with radius @xmath116   .",
    "the observed extinction of some diffuse streaks is in agreement with the form of the structure factor given by eqs  [ vec],[shell ] .",
    "in addition it should be possible to measure the change in the pb potential with temperature by computing the diffuse scattering intensities as a function of scattering vector @xmath107 .",
    "as the displacements are important ( @xmath117 ) , this would require recording the distribution of the diffuse scattering intensity at large scattering vectors .",
    "having pb ions displaced along the @xmath4 direction is consistent with the analysis of the local structure of relaxor ferroelectrics by pdf @xcite and with the observations of a rhombohedral phase transition that can be induced by application of an electric field @xcite .",
    "also recent dielectric measurements in pmn doped with pbtio@xmath11 in applied electric field have shown that the spontaneous polarization in the polar nanoregions is along @xmath4 @xcite . *",
    "describing the structure of the polar nanoregions in terms of pb - displacements only might be a too simple model . from single crystal data , we have only indirect evidence for displacements of cations at b and o sites . these ions",
    "then probably play a less important role in the formation of diffuse scattering .",
    "however , we note that qualitative understanding of x - ray diffuse scattering could be obtained by considering only pb displacements",
    ". this might be due to the smaller x - ray cross - section of o compared with the metal cations .",
    "neutron diffuse scattering analysis could then probably shed more light on o behavior if the diffuse scattering was measured with a higher quality than what was possible up to now .",
    "* the main structural feature causing the characteristic butterfly diffuse scattering in pmt is the formation of pnr where pb atoms are displaced along one @xmath4 direction ; pnr have large correlation lengths , except along the @xmath6 direction orthogonal to the pb displacement direction , thereby confirming the pancake model of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a different geometry .    in conclusion",
    ", we have analyzed the distribution of displacements in pmt by single crystal neutron diffraction and synchrotron radiation . the diffuse scattering and especially its structural origin",
    "have been understood qualitatively .",
    "another interesting topic is the relationship between coherent pb @xmath118-displacements in pnrs and the known b - site partial ordering , with @xmath119 broad satellites ( see fig .",
