    "over the past decade , network analysis  @xcite has proved to be a suitable tool for describing diverse systems , understanding their structure and analyzing their properties .",
    "however , the evolution of the web and the capability of storing large amounts of data have caused the size of networked systems and thus their complexity to increase .",
    "the algorithms for analyzing and visualizing networks appear impractical for addressing very large systems .",
    "therefore , different methods have been proposed for the simplification of complex networks .",
    "simplification is a process that reduces the size of a network by decreasing the number of nodes and links .",
    "the procedure is derived from graph theory ( e.g. , partitioning  @xcite and blockmodeling  @xcite ) and was initially developed for compression and efficient graph storage  @xcite . with the increasing complexity of networks , simplification methods also support clearer visualization  @xcite and efficient analysis  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these benefits , analyzing the changes undergone by networks under the effects of the simplification process enables us to explore and explain the differences between complete ( i.e. , original ) and incomplete ( i.e. , simplified ) systems ( e.g. , when only partial insight into the structure of network is available ) .",
    "recently , network simplification has been extensively investigated from different perspectives .",
    "some studies have concentrated on the simplification of specific networks , such as simplifying social networks based on stability and retention  @xcite , sampling scale - free  @xcite or directed networks  @xcite , estimating different properties under social network crawling  @xcite , sampling large dynamic peer - to - peer networks with random walks  @xcite or simplifying flow networks by removing useless links  @xcite .",
    "other studies have attempted to provide a sufficient fit to original networks and thus observe the changes in network properties under the effects of simplification , such as preserving the clustering coefficient  @xcite , degree distribution  @xcite , community structure  @xcite , spectral properties  @xcite or network connectivity  @xcite .    however",
    ", only a few studies have focused on comparing simplification methods and measuring their success .",
    "leskovec  et  al .",
    "@xcite observed properties of original and simplified networks submitted to several simplification methods and measured their success based on random walk similarity .",
    "lee  et  al .",
    "@xcite analyzed basic network properties under the effects of three simplification methods and revealed characteristic patterns of changes in properties .",
    "hbler  et  al .",
    "@xcite compared their simplification algorithm to existing ones by measuring the average distance of properties between original and simplified networks .",
    "toivonen  et  al .",
    "@xcite studied the compression of weighted networks and measured the method s efficiency according to the running time and cost of the compressed network representation .",
    "doer and blenn  @xcite tested the convergence of different properties under three traversal algorithms applied to a single large social network .",
    "the findings of the aforementioned analyses indicate that the performances of simplification methods vary ; however , the common weakness of these studies is the small set of networks considered .    despite the above - described efforts , several open questions remain concerning the simplification of complex networks , such as those regarding ( q1 ) how to evaluate the similarity between original and simplified network , ( q2 ) how small simplified networks should be and ultimately ( q3 ) what simplification method should be used . in this paper , we address these questions and propose an approach for assessing the effectiveness of the simplification process .",
    "we analyze @xmath0 real - world networks of different size and origin under the effects of six different simplification methods .",
    "we compare the original and simplified networks based on several network properties ( e.g. , degree distribution , clustering coefficient  @xcite , betweenness centrality  @xcite , degree mixing  @xcite and transitivity  @xcite ) ( q1 ) .",
    "the selection of these properties is supported by their common use in similar studies  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we propose a measure for determining the most appropriate size of simplified networks for preserving the observed properties ( q2 ) and for determining under which method the simplified networks fit the original ones most closely ( q3 ) .",
    "we also study the impact of the original network size and type on the effectiveness of the simplification process .    the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : methods ] focuses on the simplification methods and real - world networks used in the study and describes the proposed measure . in section  [ sec : analys ] , we report and formally discuss the results of the analysis .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper and suggests directions for future research .",
    "several authors have proposed a broad collection of simplification methods , which can be divided into two general classes . those in the first class are sampling methods in which a simplified network is represented by a random sample of the original network ( e.g. , random node selection  @xcite , random link selection  @xcite , snowball sampling  @xcite , random walk sampling  @xcite and forest fire  @xcite ) .",
    "methods in the second class obtain simplified networks by merging nodes and links into supernodes and superlinks based on different characteristics , such as the distance between nodes ( e.g. , cluster - growing and box - tiling renormalization  @xcite ) , node and link attributes ( e.g. , link weights  @xcite and node attributes  @xcite ) or community structure ( e.g. , balanced propagation and modularity optimization  @xcite ) .    in this study , we adopt four basic sampling methods ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sampl ] ) .",
    "random node  @xcite ( rn ) and random link selection  @xcite ( rl ) create sampled networks with nodes or links selected uniformly at random .",
    "simplified networks under random node selection based on degree  @xcite ( rd ) consist of randomly selected nodes , where the probability of selecting a node is proportional to the node s degree . in breadth - first sampling ( bf )",
    ", a random node with its broad neighborhood is selected into the sample using the breadth - first search strategy .",
    "the main advantages of these methods are simplicity , and thus efficient implementation with low time complexity , and adjustability , which enables setting the size of the simplified network in advance .",
    "sampling methods outperform merging ones in terms of the advantages listed above .",
    "still , we consider two methods from the merging class ( fig .",
    "[ fig : merg ] ) .",
    "we use merging nodes based on community detection , where supernodes are identified by communities revealed by balanced propagation  @xcite ( bp ) .",
    "we also employ cluster - growing renormalization  @xcite ( cg ) , which incrementally grows supernodes from randomly selected seed nodes within a distance not larger than @xmath2 ( the nodes within one supernode are at most @xmath3 steps apart ) . both methods proved well in analyzing the invariance of network density under different renormalizations  @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath4 as the number of nodes in the simplified network , measured as the fraction of nodes in the original network . for sampling",
    ", we set the sizes of the simplified networks as varying from @xmath5 to @xmath6 of the original networks ( @xmath7 and @xmath8-@xmath9 with a step size of @xmath10 ) . for bp",
    ", we set the parameters of the algorithm as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "with cg , we can not control the size of the simplified network ; still , we can change the distance between the nodes within one supernode .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath2 ranges from two to six , where smaller values indicate a smaller number of nodes within one supernode and thus a larger simplified network",
    ".      a diverse set of real - world systems is analyzed .",
    "we consider @xmath0 networks of different origin ( e.g. , information , technological and social ) and size ( varying from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand nodes ) , listed in table  [ tbl : nets ] . due to the large number of networks considered ,",
    "a detailed description is omitted here .    for bp , cg and bf ,",
    "all networks are considered to be undirected , although some of them are directed . to avoid comparing networks of different complexity",

    ", we select a set of local and global network properties to be observed . to address q2",
    ", we introduce a simple measure that takes into account all of the selected properties and for each network calculates the simplified size that would best preserve the observed properties .",
    "the specific size of the simplified networks is then used in a further analysis to compare the selected simplification methods ( q3 ) .",
    "we compare networks based on eight fundamental global and local properties .",
    "the global properties are expressed by a single value for each network and include density ( the ratio of existing links to all possible links ) , degree mixing ( the tendency of nodes connecting to similar ones  @xcite ) and transitivity ( the number of closed triplets over the total number of triplets  @xcite ) .",
    "the local properties are described by a distribution for all nodes in the network and comprise degree , in - degree and out - degree ( the number of neighbors of each node ) , local clustering coefficient ( the proportion of connected neighbors of each node  @xcite ) and betweenness centrality ( the number of shortest paths between all nodes going through each node  @xcite ) .    for comparison , we define two similarity measures , one based on the selected global properties and one on the selected local properties .",
    "the global similarity measure is used to determine how correlated the global properties in the observed original networks and their simplified version are .",
    "the correlation is measured with spearman s correlation coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath73 indicates the extent to which one variable decreases as another increases . in our analysis",
    ", we calculate @xmath73 for each selected simplification method and each size of the simplified networks for all networks together .",
    "the comparison based on the selected local properties is expressed using the kolmogorov - smirnov @xmath74-statistic ( kolmogorov - smirnov test checks the null - hypothesis , i.e. , that the distributions of two properties are the same ; the d - statistic measures the distance between the observed distributions ) .",
    "the @xmath74-statistic for each network and its simplified version is calculated for each simplification method separately .",
    "the values for comparison based on @xmath73 and the @xmath74-statistics are averaged over ten simplifications of each network , each simplification method and each size of the simplified networks .",
    "the selection of properties and their relevance in assessing the effectiveness of network simplification greatly depends on the purpose of the simplification being performed .",
    "the selection of particular properties in this analysis is only supported by their common use in similar studies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and serve to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach .",
    "note that comparing networks based on other sets of properties may lead to different results .    in the literature , we can find studies that have performed similar comparisons to a limited extent . in  @xcite the authors proved that rn does not preserve the degree distribution of scale - free networks .",
    "moreover , rn and rl sampling are biased toward nodes with high degrees , which affects the degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "however , lee et al .",
    "@xcite proved that rn and rl overestimate the degree and betweenness centrality exponent , whereas both methods retain the assortativity of original networks .",
    "merging methods decreases the density  @xcite , but the relationship between density and network size remains invariant after simplification .      to determine the size to which a specific network can be decreased while preserving most of the observed properties , the following approach is used .",
    "for each simplification method and each global and local property , we rank sizes with respect to @xmath73 and the @xmath74-statistic , respectively . the network size that best fits a specific property receives rank 0 , the next best one receives rank 1 and so on .",
    "next , we sum the ranks for each size and divide the sum by the greatest possible sum of ranks to normalize the result to the interval @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "thus , the measure @xmath76 is defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the number of different sizes , @xmath79 denotes the number of properties , @xmath80 indexes the properties ( the order is not important ) and @xmath81 is the rank of the @xmath82th property .",
    "@xmath76 is thus the normalized total rank assigned to a specific size by the observed properties .",

    "the worst method for preserving local properties is rl , whereas for larger ones , the worst method is rn .",
    "+     +   +      the results of the second part of the study reveal several distinctions in the behavior of the simplification methods .",
    "rd and bf proved the best for preserving the local properties of networks , whereas for global properties , rn outperforms the other methods .",
    "however , rl and merging methods show the worst performance . these findings are consistent with the results of the study reported in  @xcite , where rd had a better performance than rn and rl ( other methods are not considered in the aforementioned study ) .",
    "in addition to comparing the methods for @xmath195 , we also compare them for larger simplified networks ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the results are not presented because there are no significant changes in the results ( i.e. , the same methods are the best and the worst for @xmath195 ) .    in addition , we observe how the size of the largest weakly connected component ( lwcc ) changes under simplification to explain the differences in the methods performance .",
    "the lwcc of the original networks , on average , consists of @xmath212 of all nodes .",
    "the size of the lwcc of the simplified networks under all methods depends strongly on the simplified network size ( i.e. , the size of the lwcc of the smallest simplified networks is the smallest ) .",
    "however , rn and rl show similar performance because the sizes of the lwcc for both methods vary from @xmath5 for @xmath195 to @xmath213 for @xmath116 .",
    "still , rl produces the most disconnected components .",
    "in contrast , simplification via rd and bf produces networks with a clearly larger lwcc because the sizes vary from @xmath214 for @xmath7 to @xmath215 for @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , networks simplified by rd and bf feature a larger lwcc and smaller number of components , which is more similar to the characteristics of the original networks . based on this finding , the predominance of rd and bf over rn and rl can be confirmed .",
    "network simplification is an adequate tool for studying large networks for several reasons .",
    "in addition to the obvious advantages , including faster analysis and more efficient visualization , the simplification can significantly improve the understanding of large networks .",
    "for example , data regarding the systems described by networks can often be missing or incomplete , and thus , networks can be considered a sampled variety of the original systems ( e.g. , identifying internet map  @xcite ) . for this reason , understanding how similar the original and sampled system are is essential .",
    "this study addressed three aspects of real - world network simplification .",
    "first , we focused on a comparison of original and simplified networks .",
    "second , we determined what size of simplified network most adequately fits the properties of the original networks . finally , we compared the effectiveness of several simplification methods .",
    "we analyzed six simplification methods with respect to @xmath0 real - world networks and compared the simplified and original networks based on several properties , including degree , in - degree , out - degree and betweenness centrality distribution , clustering coefficient , density , degree mixing and transitivity .",
    "the results show that the goodness of property preservation depends on the size of the simplified networks .",
    "larger simplified networks fit original networks better ; nevertheless , properties are adequately preserved for smaller sizes close to @xmath1 the size of the original networks , especially for random node selection based on degree and breadth - first sampling .",
    "thus , the decision regarding how small a simplified network should be depends on the size of the original network and the purpose of the simplified network .",
    "if we can simplify a network by @xmath6 , we can provide for the best fit of the original network properties .",
    "however , if the network is large , @xmath6 of the original size is not a sufficient reduction . in that case , @xmath1 of the original network size allows for the adequate preservation of important properties .",
    "furthermore , the findings of this study reveal that random node selection based on degree and breadth - first sampling are the best methods , whereas merging methods performed the worst .",
    "future work will mainly focus on other characteristics that affect the effectiveness of the simplification process .",
    "moreover , instead of focusing solely on similarities , we will analyze typical distinctions between original and simplified networks .",
    "furthermore , other ways for comparing simplified networks with original for their similarity could also be considered , for example comparing the backbones of networks  @xcite , their community structure  @xcite or density of edges in subnetworks  @xcite .",
    "based on this and future studies , a wide range of principles underlying the simplification of real - world networks could be extracted .",
    "the application of such principles should allow for the determination of the most suitable simplification method for specific networks , which would allow for more efficient simplification and a better understanding of large real - world networks .",
