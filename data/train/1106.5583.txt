    "the difference likely arises from the conversion of the assigned stellar mass to a v - band luminosity . @xcite",
    "assume a mass - to - light ratio @xmath29 to be typical for old stellar populations , while we find that @xmath30 better fits the range of ages and metallicities we assign to the infalling satellites ( see below ) .",
    "a similar argument holds for the @xcite relation , which directly assigns a v - band luminosity to a halo of a given mass , instead of a stellar mass .",
    "additionally , some of the halos in vlii lose a fraction of their stellar mass after accretion from tidal stripping , an effect that may not have been treated in the other two studies .",
    "our stellar mass - subhalo mass relation at infall has a scaling similar to the low - mass end ( @xmath31 ) galaxy stellar mass  halo virial mass relation , @xmath32 , derived at @xmath33 by @xcite using an abundance matching technique .",

    "when comparing the above relation to the one derived for sdss galaxies , we note that it lies below the extrapolation of the @xcite relation .",
    "this suggests that processes governing metal formation and retention in dsphs may be significantly different from those in more massive galaxies .    finally ,",
    "while all particles in a given subhalo are tagged at a single epoch ( infall ) , they have a distribution of stellar ages resulting from applying equation ( [ eq : mstar ] ) to the history of dark matter build - up of each halo prior to its infall and assigning the respective age @xmath25 to the corresponding fraction of tagged stellar mass .",
    "this process mimics the extended star formation histories of dwarf satellites in the mw halo ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the total mass of the stellar halo today is @xmath39 within 402 kpc ( of which @xmath40 is in bound substructures ) , and table [ table : snap ] lists the contribution to @xmath41 from each snapshot : the peak contribution comes from redshift 2 .",

    ", we allow these two parameters to vary in the intervals @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "we have verified that the upper limit on the outer slope @xmath95 is high enough to accommodate the profiles of even the most massive vlii subhalos , whose density profiles fall off faster than those of field halos in the tidally - stripped outer regions @xcite .",
    "the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath100 is largely unconstrained by current observations . according to its definition",
    ", @xmath100 can vary between @xmath101 and 1 , with @xmath102 when @xmath103 and @xmath104 when @xmath105 .",
    "available data are often in the form of 1-d line - of - sight velocity dispersion , insufficient to constrain @xmath83 and @xmath106 individually .",
    "these two quantities are well determined only at the very center and very edge of a system , since @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in between these two extremes ,",
    "the mass of a dsph enclosed within a radius close to the system s half - light radius can be calculated such that the uncertainty from the velocity anisotropy term is minimized @xcite . at any other intermediate radius",
    ", the @xmath100 parameter will more strongly affect the mass measurement and must be estimated using a theoretical model . in principle , @xmath100 can be a function of radius within a particular system @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that marginalizing over a set of parameters that define a general anisotropy profile does not constrain the mass distribution better than assuming @xmath100 to be constant with radius @xcite .",
    "the latter case , however , greatly simplifies the solution to the spherical jeans equation @xcite : @xmath109    the standard procedure in mass modeling of pressure - supported systems is to generate a theoretical velocity dispersion profile that fits the observed one , and to marginalize the solution over all free parameters but the density profile normalization .",
    "while most model parameters are largely unconstrained by this fitting procedure , the density profile normalization ( defined as the total amount of mass enclosed in a fixed aperture radius , typically 300 pc or 600 pc ) is very well determined by the data @xcite .",
    "it is this analysis that yields the so - called `` common mass scale '' of mw dsph satellites .",
    "we apply the mass measurement technique above to the simulated data using the following procedure :    1 .",
    "obtain @xmath110 and @xmath75 for a satellite of interest ; 2 .   choose the density profile and anisotropy parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath100 ; 3 .",
    "integrate the jeans equation ( [ eq : jeans ] ) to solve for @xmath111 ; 4 .",
    "project @xmath111 along the line of sight ( eq . [ eq : jeansproj ] ) ; 5 .",
    "compare the solution to the measured @xmath110 ; 6 .",
    "iterate ( 2 - 5 ) to find the model that best matches the kinematic data .",
    "once the best fit mass density profile is determined , we integrate it to a given aperture radius , either 300 pc or 600 pc from the satellite center to obtain the total enclosed mass , m@xmath72 or m@xmath112 , and compare it directly to the  true \" value in the simulation . to obtain the `` mock '' observations of vlii dsphs in step 1 , we place `` hypothetical observers '' in the simulation volume , and reduce computational time by  observing \" each of the 65 detectable satellites only 11 times .",
    "one of the `` observers '' is always in the center of the vlii main host , while the other 10 are randomly distributed at the same distance from the satellite as the galactocentric `` observer '' . in this way we attempt to capture the anisotropy of subhalos physical shapes and velocity ellipsoids .",
    "since integrating the jeans equation requires a boundary condition on @xmath113 , which is not known a priori from the data , the line - of - sight projected solution can not be trusted across the full extent of the surface brightness fit .",
    "the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile is therefore calculated in 10 linear distance bins out to 60% of each satellite s tidal radius @xmath114 .",
    "the simulated data used to determine each subhalo s kinematic profile do not have an associated observational uncertainty . to make a fair comparison with the derived mass estimates ,",
    "`` observational '' errors should be consistent with the ones in the current literature @xcite . this is done by randomly assigning error values @xmath115 ranging between 1 and 2 @xmath80 to the velocity dispersion data when evaluating the goodness of fit in equation ( [ eq : like ] ) below .",
    "sample line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles for two vlii simulated satellites and their assigned `` observational '' errors are shown in the top left panel of figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "the two satellites have masses of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively . for each satellite",

    "the average @xmath118 values inferred from these 11 fits are @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively , within 8@xmath119 of the true values .    to get the above estimates",
    ", we fit a model to each `` observed '' kinematic profile using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) . a theoretical velocity dispersion profile @xmath122 is computed for each parameter set in step 2 . and the likelihood of the fit is evaluated as : @xmath123 \\label{eq : like}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion measured at radius @xmath125 and @xmath115 is its associated error .",
    "each mcmc chain is initialized to maximize the likelihood @xmath126 on a coarse model grid that spans the full parameter space .",
    "it is then left to explore the parameter space following the metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "two concurrent chains are run on each data set and the mcmc is stopped after 10,000 attempts of each chain .",
    "this number is large enough to provide satisfactory fits to the kinematic data @xcite .",
    "the 11 resulting likelihood functions for @xmath118 of the two satellites above are shown in the right top panel in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "once the best - fit model for each data set has been found , it provides the full mass density profile that can be integrated to any distance from the dsph center , with 300 pc or 600 pc being of particular interest .",
    "there are 11 likelihood distributions for the estimates of @xmath118 and @xmath127 of each vlii satellite , and these can be compared to the true values .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig8 ] , in which we plot the average of the 11 best mass estimates as a function of the true dark matter mass .",
    "the nature of the mcmc data allows us to make two estimates for the error in each case .",
    "the smaller error bars ( in black ) in figure  [ fig8 ] reflect the span of the 11 best fit values for each satellite .",
    "the larger errors ( in grey ) span the full range in values where the likelihood of the fit has fallen to 10@xmath119 of its maximum value .",
    "for the particular two satellites in the top panels of figure  [ fig8 ] , we thus have the following mass estimates : @xmath128 for the lower - mass satellite and @xmath129 for the higher - mass one , where the first set of errors corresponds to the best fit value range and the second set of errors corresponds to the 10@xmath119 likelihood value range .",
    "we infer that the spherical jeans analysis is a robust method to estimate the central masses of dsph satellite galaxies .",
    "the mean best fit @xmath118 values determined through the jeans analysis are on average within 12@xmath119 of the true vlii values .",
    "the normalized scatter among the 11 best fits about the mean value is @xmath130 on average and is shown as solid lines in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "the normalized full range scatter about the mean where the likelihood of the fit is greater than 10@xmath119 of its peak value is @xmath131 on average ( dashed lines ) .",
    "no significant difference to these results arises when just the galactocentric observer s estimates are considered : the best fit galactocentric estimate of @xmath118 across the full mass range is on average within 16@xmath119 of the true vlii value .",
    "when evaluating @xmath127 , we exclude systems that have @xmath132 .",
    "it is apparent in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig8 ] that these exhibit a larger scatter than the systems with @xmath133 .",
    "the smallest dsphs host stellar systems smaller than 0.6 kpc in radial extent .",
    "the estimate of @xmath127 for them is therefore an extrapolation to a region in parameter space where tracers are simply not present . among the dsphs with kinematic data available all the way to @xmath134 kpc , the mean best fit @xmath127 value determined with the jeans analysis is on average within 17@xmath119 of the true vlii value .",
    "the normalized scatter among the 11 best fits about the mean value is @xmath135 on average .",
    "the normalized full range scatter about the mean where the likelihood of the fit is greater than 10@xmath119 of its peak value is @xmath136 on average .",
    "the vlii galactocentric observer would report a @xmath127 value within 23@xmath119 of the true vlii value .",
    "the range in @xmath110 and @xmath75 when measured from different viewpoints is due to the anisotropic velocity tensor of the dsph and any deviation from perfect sphericity of its shape .",
    "the mass estimate uncertainties among the best - fit values presented here should therefore be regarded as intrinsic , cosmologically - induced ones that will eventually be minimized when 3-d kinematic data is collected and better models of the nature of dsph satellites in high - resolution , fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are carried out .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig9 ] , we plot the mass enclosed in the inner 300 pc versus total luminosity for all satellites that would be visible according to the sdss detection limit . overplotted are data from @xcite , suggesting a `` common mass scale '' .",
    "observable vlii dsphs exhibit a behavior similar to the mw dsph population , though a linear fit suggests a shallow but significant correlation between m@xmath72 and the total luminosity : m@xmath137 , where the error on the slope reflects the 1@xmath67 deviation from bootstrap re - sampling of the sample .",
    "this is steeper than the @xmath138 relation derived from observational data @xcite .",
    "lowering the derived @xmath118 values of some of the ultra - faint dsphs , as suggested by @xcite for the case of the hercules dwarf , might be sufficient to reconcile the observations with the slope predicted from our model .    in our model , the nearly constant @xmath118",
    "is explained by the combination of the steep adopted stellar mass - halo mass relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : mstar ] ) and the sdss detectability magnitude limit .",
    "the remaining @xmath139 vlii surviving subhalos to which we assigned stars ( about 200 of which are more luminous than @xmath140 ) are just too faint to be detected by a sdss - like survey .",
    "some of them have @xmath118 significantly lower than @xmath141 m@xmath142 ( see the right panel of figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "@xcite has recently pointed out that state - of - the - art collisionless simulations of galactic structure , both vlii and aquarius , predict a population of massive subhalos that appear to be too dense ( i.e. have too high a @xmath6 for a given @xmath143 ) to host any of the known mw dsph .",
    "while a failure of the cdm model is one interpretation of this result , another possibility is that star formation becomes stochastic below some mass , in which case the mw halo would harbor several massive but dark satellites .",
    "it is also quite plausible that baryonic feedback processes in the more massive subhalos redistribute some of their dark matter , thereby lowering their central density ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for reference",
    "we have marked the six vlii subhalos that are too dense according to the @xcite analysis in the left panel of figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "of these six , five have a luminosity greater than @xmath144 and would have been detected as luminous dsph satellites . in our model , it is thus not possible for these overdense subhalos to have evaded detection because of an effectively low star formation efficiency resulting , for example , from their accretion or orbital history .",
    "as expected , these six halos have the highest values of @xmath118 for their luminosity among all vlii satellites . a reduction in @xmath118 by about a factor of two",
    "would bring them into agreement with the classical mw dsph sample .",
    "our study of the standard jeans analysis demonstrates that the ` observed ' m@xmath145 values can not be changed by that amount , i.e. that errors in the mass estimates are not responsible for the discrepancy between the models and the observations .",
    "future , high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of mw analogs that include an accurate treatment of baryonic processes and their effects on the central densities of luminous satellites will be crucial to the settling of this outstanding issue .",
    "we have used a particle tagging technique to dynamically populate the @xmath0-body _ via lactea ii _ high - resolution simulation with stars .",
    "the method is calibrated using the observed luminosity function of mw satellites , the concentration of their stellar populations , and the metallicity ",
    "luminosity correlation they exhibit , and self - consistently follows the accretion and disruption of progenitor dwarfs and the build - up of the stellar halo .",
    "the particle tagging technique makes full use of 27 simulation snapshots spanning the assembly history of the vlii main host between @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "a subset of the most bound dark matter particles in each of about 3,200 progenitor subhalos is tagged as stars at infall , when star particles acquire a stellar mass , an age , and a metallicity .",
    "their subsequent evolution is purely photometric and kinematical in character , as the collisionless stellar populations age following population synthesis models , and are accreted and disrupted in a comological  live host \" .",
    "luminous particles linked to self - bound substructures in the @xmath22 snapshot constitute a surviving population of dsph satellites . like the previous studies of @xcite and @xcite , we have shown that simple prescriptions for assigning stellar populations to collisionless particles are able to reproduce many properties of the mw dwarf satellite population , like velocity dispersions , sizes , brightness profiles , metallicities , and spatial distribution . in agreement with previous results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a steep stellar mass - subhalo mass relation is required to fit the observed luminosity function of mw dsphs and offer an empirical solution to the missing satellite problem .",

    "the satellite maximum circular velocity @xmath6 and stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath7 today follow the relation @xmath8 , i.e. stellar particles in satellites have smaller velocity dispersions than the dark matter .",
    "the ability to obtain simultaneous brightness and kinematic fits for dsphs like sculptor and carina is a confirmation of earlier searches for mw satellite counterparts in simulated halos such as the one by @xcite and a success of our model .",
    "it is a prerequisite for studying another small - scale puzzle of galaxy formation in @xmath10cdm , namely the observed `` common mass scale '' of mw satellites , i.e. the fact that , despite spanning about 5 decades in luminosity , mw dsphs appear to contain a similar amount of dark mass , @xmath12 , within a fixed aperture radius of 300 pc from their centers @xcite .",

    "ultimately , the prescriptions used in this work must be tested with hydrodynamical simulations that include baryonic physics .",
