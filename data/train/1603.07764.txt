    "to address the impact of these issues , quantitative analyses of both the effect of blending of the light from different stellar populations , and of the effects of spatial resolution on extinction estimates will be necessary .",

    "to minimize discontinuities and sudden changes of seds for intermediate ages , we inspected the flux differences over the 0.43.75  wavelength range ( the relevant range for the @xmath1  method ; see t09 ) between  and  seds in that age range ( see fig .",
