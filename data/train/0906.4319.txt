    "the chiral tomonaga - luttinger liquid at the fractional quantum hall edge becomes an active subject since wen s hydrodynamic and effective field formulation @xcite .",
    "the effective edge theory is derived from the bulk effective chern - simons theory .",
    "it predicts a nonlinear current - voltage relationship @xmath0 with an universal exponent @xmath1 , e.g. @xmath2 at the filling fraction @xmath3 . for the jain fractions @xmath4 ,",
    "the power - law behavior is also predicted by including the effect of residual disorder @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments @xcite establish the existence of tomonaga - luttinger - liquid - like behavior .",
    "however , the tunneling exponent measured is different from the prediction , e.g. @xmath5 at @xmath3 .",
    "the discrepancy between experiment and theory has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "many works have attempted to explain the discrepancy . for the compressible quantum hall fluid , the edge density enhancement is considered @xcite . for @xmath3 and other jain fractions @xmath6",
    ", some papers suggest that the discrepancy is due to edge reconstruction @xcite .",
    "in contrast , some propose that the exponent is not universal , since the discrepancy persists even in the absence of edge reconstruction @xcite .",
    "it s still an open question .",
    "an elementary derivation of the chern - simons description of the quantum hall effect was given by susskind @xcite , wherein he claimed that the noncommutative version of the description is exactly equivalent to the laughlin theory .",
    "as many successes on the connection between two theories have been achieved in a collection of papers @xcite , we would stress that noncommutative chern - simons theory is a workable microscopic description for the quantum hall fluid .",
    "recently , this theory has been extended for constructing the hierarchy of fractional quantum hall states @xcite .    in this paper , we try to pursue two questions : whether the edge states in fractional quantum hall effects could be described by means of microscopic dynamics rather than an effective theory ; whether a more reliable and sounder exponent @xmath1 could be derived .",
    "the strategy is the following . based on susskind s microscopic derivation @xcite",
    ", we will reformulate wen s edge theory @xcite .",
    "firstly we give a constraint by considering microscopic dynamics : relabeling symmetry of the electrons and incompressibility of the fluid .",
    "the constraint should be obviously more natural than that given by choosing a gauge - fixing condition in wen s theory .",
    "secondly we solve the constraint exactly .",
    "it s amazing to find that the solution as well as the action has a total differential form .",
    "finally we reduce the @xmath7 dimensional chern - simons theory to an @xmath8 dimensional noncommutative chiral tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory , which contains interaction terms expanding to all orders in the noncommutative parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the commutative limit of it is wen s theory .",
    "furthermore , as our theory contains interaction terms , it will predict a new exponent and may provide a solution to the discrepancy mentioned above .",
    "so we calculate one - loop feynman diagrams caused by the interactions .",
    "we notice the existence of a shortest incompressible distance and impose an ultraviolet cutoff to evaluate the integrals .",
    "then we get one - loop corrections to the phonon and electron propagators .",
    "the electron propagator still exhibits a power - law correlation , but with a newly corrected prediction of the exponent which is in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "this is a support of our derivation .",
    "briefly , we derive a noncommutative field theory of the quantum hall edge from microscopic dynamics . we would claim that it should be sounder than existing effective theories .",
    "previously @xcite , we have argued that the chern - simons description of the edge excitations would receive a natural explanation from the microscopic construction .",
    "recently , a similar subject was discussed incompletely @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "when the magnetic field is strong , the kinetic term is dropped ; @xmath32 .    in the strong magnetic field , the lowest landau level dominates and the system behaves as the quantum hall fluid . due to the pauli exclusion principle , the electrons are incompressible with a minimal area @xmath33",

    "as @xmath42 , the factor @xmath43 is truly the ratio of electrons to magnetic flux quanta .",
