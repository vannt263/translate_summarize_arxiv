    "suppose we are organizing a seminar and must allocate @xmath0 discussion topics and @xmath0 dates to @xmath0 students .",
    "students have heterogeneous and combinatorial preferences over ( topic , date ) bundles : a student s preferences over the topics may depend on the date and vice versa , because she may prefer an early date if she gets an easy topic and may prefer a late date if she gets a hard topic .",
    "this example illustrates a common setting for allocating multiple indivisible items , which we formulate as a _",
    "categorized domain_. a categorized domain contains multiple indivisible items , each of which belongs to one of the @xmath1 categories . in _ categorized domain allocation problems ( cdaps ) _ , we want to design a mechanism to allocate the items to agents without monetary transfer , such that each agent gets at least one item per category . in the above example",
    ", there are two categories : topics and dates , and each agent ( student ) must get a topic and a date .",
    "many other allocation problems are cdaps . for example , in cloud computing , agents have heterogeneous preferences over multiple types of items including cpu , memory , and storage  @xcite ; patients must be allocated multiple types of resources including surgeons , nurses , rooms , and equipment  @xcite ; college students need to choose courses from multiple categories per semester , e.g.  computer science courses , math courses , social science courses , etc .",
    "the design and analysis of allocation mechanisms for non - categorized domains have been an active research area at the interface of computer science and economics . in computer science ,",
    "allocation problems have been studied as _ multi - agent resource allocation _  @xcite . in economics ,",
    "allocation problems have been studied as _",
    "one - sided matching _ , also known as _ assignment problems _",
    "previous research faces three main barriers .",
    "@xmath2 _ preference bottleneck : _ when the number of items is not too small , it is impractical for the agents to express their preferences over all ( exponential ) bundles of items .",
    "@xmath2 _ computational bottleneck : _ even if the agents can express their preferences compactly using some preference language , computing an `` optimal '' allocation is often a hard combinatorial optimization problem .",
    "@xmath2 _ threats of agents strategic behavior : _ an agent may have incentive to report untruthfully to obtain a more preferred bundle .",
    "this may lead to a socially inefficient allocation .",
    "we initiate the study of mechanism design under the novel framework of cdaps towards breaking the three aforementioned barriers .",
    "cdaps naturally generalize classical non - categorized allocation problems , which are cdaps with one category .",
    "cdaps are our main conceptual contribution . as a first step , we focus on _ basic categorized domain allocation problems ( basic cdaps ) _ , where the number of items in each category is exactly the same as the number of agents , so that each agent gets exactly one item from each category .",
    "see e.g.  the seminar - organization example .",
    "our technical contributions are two - fold .",
    "first , we characterize _ serial dictatorships _ for any basic cdaps with at least two categories by a minimal set of three axiomatic properties : _ strategy - proofness _ , _ non - bossiness _ , and _ category - wise neutrality_. this helps us understand the possibility of designing strategy - proof mechanisms to overcome the third barrier , i.e.  threats of agents strategic behavior .",
    "second , to overcome the preference bottleneck and the computational bottleneck , and to go beyond serial dictatorships , we propose _ categorial sequential allocation mechanisms ( csams ) _ , which are a large class of indirect mechanisms that naturally extend serial dictatorships  @xcite , sequential allocation protocols  @xcite , and the draft mechanism  @xcite . for @xmath3 agents and @xmath4 categories ,",
    "a csam is defined by an ordering over all ( agent , category ) pairs : in each round , the active agent picks an item that has not been chosen yet from the designated category .",
    "csams have low communication complexity and low computational complexity .",
    "we completely characterize the worst - case _ rank efficiency _ of csams , measured by agents _ ranks _ of the bundles they receive , for any combination of two types of _ myopic _ agents : _ optimistic _ agents , who always choose the item in their top - ranked bundle that is still available , and _ pessimistic _",
    "agents , who always choose the item that gives them best worst - case guarantee .",
    "this characterization naturally leads to useful corollaries on worst - case efficiency of various csams .",
    "for example , we show that while serial dictatorships with all - optimistic agents have the best worst - case utilitarian rank , they have the worst worst - case egalitarian rank ( proposition  [ prop : optsd ] ) . on the other hand , balanced csams with all - pessimistic agents have good worst - case egalitarian rank ( proposition  [ prop : bcsm ] ) . for strategic agents , we prove an upper bound on the worst - case rank efficiency for all csams , and a matching lower bound for two agents .",
    "we also use computer simulation to further compare expected utilitarian rank and expected egalitarian rank of some natural csams where agents preferences are generated from the _ mallows model _",
    "we observe that serial dictatorships with all - optimistic agents have good expected utilitarian rank and bad expected egalitarian rank .",
    "on the other hand , the balanced csams with all - pessimistic agents have good expected egalitarian rank .",
    "we are not aware of previous work that explicitly formulates the cdap framework .",
    "previous work on multi - type resource allocation assumes that items of the same type are interchangeable , and agents have specific preferences , e.g.  _ leontief preferences _  @xcite and threshold preferences  @xcite .",
    "cdaps are more general as agents preferences are only required to be rankings but not otherwise restricted .    from the modeling perspective , ignoring the categorial information , cdaps become standard centralized multi - agent resource allocation problems .",
    "however , the categorial information opens more possibilities for designing natural allocation mechanisms such as csams .",
    "more importantly , we believe that cdaps provide a natural framework for cross - fertilization of ideas and techniques from other fields of preference representation and aggregation .",
    "for example , the combinatorial structure of categorized domains naturally allows agents to use graphical languages ( e.g.  _ cp - nets _",
    "@xcite ) to represent their preferences , which is otherwise hard  @xcite .",
    "approaches in _ combinatorial voting _",
    "@xcite can also be naturally considered in cdaps . technically , one - sided matching problems are basic cdaps with one category . our characterization of serial dictatorships for basic cdaps are stronger than characterizations of serial dictatorships and similar mechanisms for one - sided matching  @xcite .",
    "this is because the category - wise neutrality used in our characterization is weaker than the neutrality used in previous work .",
    "our analysis of the worst - case rank efficiency of categorial sequential allocation mechanisms resembles the _ price of anarchy _",
    "@xcite , which is defined for strategic agents together with a social welfare function that numerically evaluates the quality of outcomes .",
    "our theorem is also related to _ distortion _ in the voting setting  @xcite , which concerns the social welfare loss caused by agents reporting a ranking instead of a utility function .",
    "nevertheless , our approach is significantly different because we focus on allocation problems for myopic and strategic agents , and we do not assume the existence of agents cardinal preferences nor a social welfare function , even though our theorem can be easily extended to study worst - case social welfare loss given a social welfare function , as in proposition  [ prop : optsd ] through  [ prop : wer ] .    finally , there is a literature in social choice on analyzing the outcomes when agents are myopic  @xcite .",
    "these papers focused on voting or cake cutting , while we focus on allocation of indivisible items .",
    "a _ categorized domain _ is composed of @xmath1 categories of indivisible items , denoted by @xmath5 . in a _ categorized domain allocation problem ( cdap ) _ , we want to allocate the items to @xmath3 agents without monetary transfer , such that each agent gets at least one item from each category .    in a",

    "when there is only one category , category - wise neutrality degenerates to the traditional neutrality for one - sided matching  @xcite . when @xmath33 , category - wise neutrality is much weaker than the traditional neutrality .",
    "a _ serial dictatorship _ is defined by a linear order @xmath34 over @xmath15 such that agents choose items in turns according to @xmath34 .",
    "a truthful agent chooses her top - ranked bundle that is still available in each step .",

    "this resembles _ ( strong )",
