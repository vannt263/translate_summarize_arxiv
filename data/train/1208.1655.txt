    "the uncertainty principle initially observed by heisenberg @xcite for the case of position and momentum , and further formulated by robertson @xcite for arbitrary pairs of observables is a central in quantum theory .",
    "it sets limits on our ability to predict the precise outcomes of two incompatible measurements on a quantum system , and at the same time provides the basis for new technologies such as quantum cryptography @xcite in quantum information .",
    "originally , the uncertainty relation is expressed in terms of the standard deviation @xmath0\\rangle|$ ] for two observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . however , this uncertainty bound is state - dependent and also trivial for finite - valued observables @xcite . to remove this pitfall and to precisely capture its physical meanings ,",
    "the original form has subsequently been recast to the entropic one @xcite , which reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the outcomes when @xmath1 is measured , and likewise for @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 quantifies the complementarity of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath7 for nondegenerate observables , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the eigenvectors of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the above uncertainty limitation applies to the case that the observer can access only to the classical information .",
    "it may be violated through clever use of entanglement , which plays a central role in quantum information .",
    "this is the quantum - memory - assisted entropic uncertainty principle , which was previously conjectured by renes and boileau @xcite , and later being strictly proved by berta _",
    "it states that if the observer can entangle the particle @xmath10 that he wishes to measure with another particle @xmath11 which serves as a quantum memory , then the uncertainty of this observer about any pair of observables can be dramatically reduced . particularly , if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are maximally entangled , then the observer is able to correctly predict the outcomes of whichever measurement is chosen .",
    "this new entropic uncertainty relation reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the conditional von neumann entropy of the postmeasurement state @xmath14 , and likewise for @xmath15 .",
    "compared with eq .",
    "( 1 ) , there is an extra term @xmath16 ( the conditional von neumann entropy of @xmath17 ) appearing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath16 is negative , the berta _",
    "_ bound ( bb ) of uncertainty in eq . ( 2 ) can be reduced comparing with previous uncertainty relation .",
    "it is also found that this negative value gives the lower bound of the one - way distillable entanglement between @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this new entropic uncertainty principle has been recently confirmed experimentally @xcite , and ignites interests of people on investigating its potential applications from various aspects @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will first relate it to quantum teleportation , and show that any two - qubit @xmath17 with negative @xmath16 gives nonclassical teleportation fidelity .",
    "it is known that teleportation is one fundamental protocol in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is crucial , both theoretically and experimentally , to know whether the fidelity of teleportation is in classical regime or in quantum regime .",
    "our result relate this important problem to the entropic uncertainty principle .",
    "we will also investigate efficiency of this new entropic uncertainty relation on witnessing entanglement in a class of bosonic structured reservoirs .",
    "it is known that entanglement plays a key role in quantum information processing such as in teleportation and in condensed matter physics ; see , for example , refs .",
    "the point of departure for this practical application ( i.e. , entanglement witness ) is eq .",
    "( 2 ) , from which one can note that if @xmath18 , then @xmath19 , and hence @xmath17 is entangled @xcite . experimentally , the value of @xmath20 can be estimated by conditional single - qubit tomography on @xmath11 @xcite , and this estimate is termed tomographic estimate ( te ) .",
    "there are other ways for estimating the uncertainty .",
    "the first is the measurement estimate ( me ) denoted by @xmath21 , which corresponds to the same measurements on both @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and are favored for its ease of implementation @xcite .",
    "this estimate provides an upper bound for the new uncertainty relation in that quantum measurements never decrease entropy .",
    "the second is the fano estimate ( fe ) obtained by using fano s inequality @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 is the binary entropy function , with @xmath24 being the probability that the outcomes of @xmath25 on @xmath10 and @xmath25 on @xmath11 are different , and @xmath26 is the dimension of @xmath10 .",
    "for the two - qubit system ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , the inequality @xmath28 is a signature of entanglement between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in this section we relate the quantum - memory - assisted entropic uncertainty principle to quantum teleportation .",
    "we will show that any two - qubit state with negative conditional von neumann entropy , which thus lowers the upper bound of the uncertainty , is a manifestation of its usefulness for nonclassical teleportation .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we suppose the sender alice wants to teleport to the receiver bob a general one - qubit state , with a two - qubit state @xmath29 ( pure or mixed ) being used as the quantum channel .",
    "then if they adopt the standard teleportation scheme ( i.e. , alice performs the bell - basis measurement while bob is equipped to perform any unitary transformation ) , the maximal average fidelity achievable can be evaluated as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the @xmath33 positive matrix with elements @xmath34 related to the bloch sphere representation of @xmath29 below @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 identity operator , @xmath38 is the vector of the pauli spin matrices , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the local bloch vectors in @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "since the teleportation fidelity is locally unitary invariant , and we can always find unitary operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 which transform the state @xmath29 into @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , it suffices to restrict our concern to the representative class of quantum channels expressed in eq .",
    "( 5 ) with less number of parameters , for which we always have @xmath49 @xmath50 gives @xmath51 and thus @xmath17 is competent for teleportation .",
    "the real numbers @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) in eq . ( 5 ) must satisfy certain constraints such that @xmath17 is a well defined density operator .",
    "particularly , for the special case of @xmath56 , physical @xmath17 are those with @xmath57 ( for simplicity , we just refer to @xmath58 in the following ) belongs to the tetrahedron @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) with vertices @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , among which separable ones are confined to the octahedron @xmath64 with vertices @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the bell states sit at the four vertices of @xmath59 , while the werner states @xcite are those represented by the lines connecting the vertices of @xmath59 with the origin of @xmath68 .    for the nonzero values of @xmath69 and/or @xmath70 , the vector @xmath58 which admits the positive semidefiniteness of @xmath17 also belongs to @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "but now some @xmath58 inside @xmath59 may not correspond to the physical states .",
    "moreover , while all the separable states are still confined to @xmath68 , there are also entangled ones with @xmath58 belongs to @xmath68 , which is different from the case of @xmath56 .",
    "since the octahedron @xmath68 is specified by latexmath:[$\\sum_{k=1}^{3 }    @xmath17 with @xmath58 belongs to the four small tetrahedra divided by @xmath68 ( i.e. , the regions inside @xmath59 and outside @xmath68 ) gives @xmath50 and thus is useful for quantum teleportation .",
    "physical @xmath17 confined to @xmath68 may also be entangled when the inner product @xmath72 , but they are useless for teleportation .",
    "now we begin to discuss the operational identification of @xmath17 useful for teleportation , and to what degree this identification can cover the whole set of physical @xmath17 useful for teleportation . when considering the standard protocol , horodecki _ et al .",
    "_ proved that any @xmath17 which violates the bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( bell - chsh ) inequality is useful for teleportation @xcite . here , we will show that the negativity of the conditional von neumann entropy of @xmath17 is also a signature of its usefulness for teleportation .",
    "particularly , these @xmath17 can be witnessed by means of the new entropic uncertainty relation , and therefore is expected to have potential applications in experiments .    to prove the above argument",
    ", we consider first @xmath17 associated with the vertices of @xmath68 .",
    "the positive semidefiniteness requires that the matrix elements @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which yield @xmath75 for physical states .",
    "for example , if @xmath76 the above requirements turn to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which are satisfied only when @xmath75 .    under the conditions of @xmath75 , we can write the explicit forms of @xmath17 at the vertices of @xmath68 , and further determine the constraints imposed on the parameters by positive semidefiniteness of @xmath17 .",
    "we use another property of the physical @xmath17 , which says that if a hermitian matrix is positive semidefinite then all of its principal minors must be non - negative .    for @xmath17 with @xmath76",
    ", we derive the second- and third - order leading principal minors as @xmath79 we see that @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 must be satisfied for ensuring the positive semidefiniteness of @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , the determinant of the @xmath83 minor formed by removing from @xmath17 its third row and third column ( i.e. , one of the third - order principal minor ) can be determined as @xmath84 , @xmath85 further gives @xmath86 . then under the conditions of @xmath87 and @xmath88 we obtain the eigenvalues of @xmath17 as @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and the eigenvalues of the reduced @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "these give rise to the quantum conditional entropy @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , one can also determine @xmath86 by the argument that @xmath17 is positive semidefinite if @xmath94 for any projector @xmath95 .",

    "one can check directly that only when @xmath86 can @xmath103 for any @xmath95 .    by using the same methodology",
    "we obtain constraints imposed on the parameters of @xmath17 associated with the remaining five vertices of @xmath68 , they are : @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath106 , @xmath107 for @xmath108 , @xmath87 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "all of these correspond to physical @xmath17 with @xmath93 .    on the other hand , physical states @xmath17 with @xmath58 belonging to @xmath68",
    "can always be written as a convex combination of states with @xmath58 at the vertices of @xmath64 , so by using the concavity of the quantum conditional entropy @xcite , we obtain @xmath111 for any density matrix @xmath17 belongs to @xmath68 [ it is also possible for @xmath111 with @xmath17 lying beyond @xmath68 ] .",
    "this means that for any physical @xmath17 with negative conditional entropy , @xmath58 must belongs to the four tetrahedra separated by @xmath68 , which gives @xmath113 , and thus makes it useful for nonclassical teleportation .",
    "we would like to point out here that the negativity of the conditional von neumann entropy and the violation of the bell - chsh inequality @xcite identify different subsets of density matrices useful for teleportation ; namely , there are @xmath17 with @xmath19 but do not violate the bell - chsh inequality [ e.g. , @xmath17 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) with @xmath114 and @xmath115 , while there are also @xmath17 which violate the bell - chsh inequality but with @xmath116 ( e.g. , the partial of the extended werner - like states @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we presented regions of the valid @xmath58 determined by @xmath19 with different @xmath69 and @xmath70 , from which one can see that for the bell - diagonal states ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) , they locate near the four vertices of @xmath59 and are symmetric with respect to the origin of @xmath68 .",
    "for the general case @xmath72 , however , the valid @xmath58 makes @xmath19 will shrink to small regions and their distribution are not symmetric with respect to the origin of @xmath68 .",
    "the geometric characterization of @xmath17 also allows us to determine fractions of different kinds of @xmath17 over the ensemble of physical @xmath17 .",
    "this can be estimated by calculating ratio of volumes of the three - dimensional spaces occupied by @xmath58 associated with different @xmath17 .",
    "here we obtained the corresponding volumes by performing monte carlo simulations , generating @xmath117 random @xmath58 uniformly distributed in the cube illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and checking if they correspond to physical @xmath17 , if they give rise to @xmath51 and if they make @xmath19 . in this way we confirmed that @xmath118 of the bell - diagonal states @xmath17 give @xmath51 ( the volume of @xmath59 is twice that of @xmath68 ) , and about @xmath119 of the bell - diagonal @xmath17 make @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , about @xmath120 of the bell - diagonal @xmath17 useful for teleportation can be identified by negativity of the conditional entropy .",
    "using the same method , we have also performed simulation for @xmath69 and @xmath70 chosen in fig .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) , and confirmed that for the former ( latter ) case about @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) of the physical @xmath17 are useful for teleportation , among which about @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) of them have negative quantum conditional entropy .",
    "entanglement is a precious resource for quantum computing , but it is fragile and can be easily destroyed by the environment .",
    "the measure of entanglement including the operational methods to distinguish it from the separable case , however , is a tricky problem .",
    "so it is of practical significance to find a straightforward witnessing method . here ,",
    "we discuss efficiency of the new entropic uncertainty relation on witnessing entanglement in open quantum systems .",
    "we consider a system consists of two identical qubits which interact independently with their own reservoir , with the single `` qubit+reservoir '' hamiltonian given by @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the transition frequency of the qubit , and @xmath127 are the pauli raising and lowering operators .",
    "the index @xmath128 labels the reservoir field mode with frequency @xmath129 , with @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) being the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator and @xmath132 being the coupling strength .",
