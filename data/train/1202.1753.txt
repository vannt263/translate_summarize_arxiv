    "followed by the isolation of single layer graphene , the study of bilayer graphene ( blg ) became a separate direction of research in the community of two dimensional materials .",
    "charge carriers in bilayer graphene have a parabolic dispersion with an effective mass of about 0.054m@xmath4,@xcite but also possess a chirality .",
    "the latter manifests itself in an unconventional quantum hall effect@xcite with the lowest landau level ( lll ) being eight fold degenerate .",
    "compared to single layer , bilayer graphene has next , to spin and valleys degrees of freedom , an additional orbital degree of freedom , where landau levels with numbers n  =  0 and 1 ( each four fold degenerate ) have the same energy.@xcite recent advances in obtaining suspended bilayer graphene devices with charge carrier mobility exceeding @xmath5 gave access to the investigation of many - body phenomena in clean bilayer graphene at low charge carrier concentration ( @xmath6).@xcite    due to the non vanishing density of states at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) , bilayer graphene is predicted to have a variety of ground states triggered by electron - electron interaction .",
    "there are two competing theories describing the ground state of blg : a transition ( i ) to a gapped layer polarized state ( excitonic instability)@xcite or ( ii ) to a gapless nematic phase.@xcite    excitonic instability is a layer polarization in which the charge density contribution from each valley and spin spontaneously shifts to one of the two graphene layers.@xcite this redistribution is caused by an arbitrarily weak interaction between charge from conduction and valence band states.@xcite since each bilayer flavor ( spin or valley ) can polarize towards either of the two layers , there are 16 possible states,@xcite which can be classified by the total polarization as being @xmath7 ferromagnetic ( all degrees of freedom choose the same layer ) , @xmath7 ferrimagnetic ( three of the four valley - spin flavors choose the same layer ) , or @xmath7 antiferromagnetic ( with no overall polarization ) . to make it clear , the therm @xmath8 should be associated to flavors ( not only spin ) orientation in between two layers .",
    "these states are considered as analogous to the biased bilayer@xcite in the sense that the charge transfer can be attributed to the ( wave vector dependent ) exchange potential difference between low - energy sites on the opposite layers.@xcite the total energy of the system is lowered by the gain in the exchange interaction via breaking of the inversion symmetry , i.e. introducing a gapped state .",
    "antiferromagnetic polarization is electrostatically favorable due to the absence of a net charge on both layers , however , the actual ground state is theoretically undefined.@xcite recent experiments have suggested the evidence of the possible existence of two of the antiferromagnetic states - the anomalous quantum hall state ( aqh)@xcite and spin polarized layer antiferromagnetic state ( laf)@xcite . to avoid possible confusion we note that in earlier literature@xcite the laf state is also called quantum valley hall state .",
    "the aqh has electrons being polarized in the same layer for both spins and in opposite layers for opposite valleys.@xcite this state has spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry and therefore possess a substantial orbital magnetization exhibiting quantized hall effect ( at zero magnetic field ) , while its spin density is everywhere zero.@xcite due to its magnetization the aqh can be favored over other ground states in the perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the laf state has opposite spin - polarization for opposite layers .",
    "in contrast to aqh , the laf state does not have topologically protected edge states , which brings its minimum conductance to zero . for both states the theoretical estimations of the gap @xmath9",
    "give the value of 1.5 - 30  mev.@xcite however , the inter - valley exchange weakly favors the laf state.@xcite one of the ways to determine the character of the bilayer ground state experimentally is to investigate the response of the gap value to the magnetic field @xmath3 ( which couples to spin ) and electrical field @xmath10 ( which couples to layer pseudospin).@xcite when zeeman coupling is included , the qah state quasiparticles simply spin - split , leaving the ground state unchanged but the charge gap reduced .",
    "it was calculated that for a 4  mev spontaneous gap at zero - field , a field of @xmath3  =  35  t drives the gap to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the gap of laf is weakly @xmath3 field dependent .",
    "the second possible description for the ground state of blg is based on a nematic phase caused by the renormalization of the low energy spectrum.@xcite detailed tight - binding model studies showed that including next - neighbor interlayer coupling changes the band structure in bilayer producing a lifshitz transition in which the isoenergetic line about each valley is broken into four pockets with linear dispersion.@xcite at the energies higher then 1  mev the four pockets merge into one pocket with the usual quadratic dispersion .",
    "moreover , electron - electron interactions might result in the further energy spectrum transformation , where the number of low energy cones can be reduced to two near each of the two @xmath11 points.@xcite in this case the minimum conductance of the bilayer graphene is supposed to be increased comparing to bilayer with parabolic dispersion ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this scenario was also supported by the experimental result on the suspended bilayer graphene in which strong spectrum reconstructions and electron topological transitions were observed.@xcite    in this paper we present electric transport properties of suspended bilayer graphene by studying its behavior in tilted magnetic fields . at @xmath3",

    "a second electron beam lithography step is used to expose trenches over which graphene membrane becomes suspended . to achieve high quality devices we use current annealing technique by sending a dc current through the membrane ( up to 1.1  ma ) at the temperature of 4.2  k. while ramping up the dc current , simultaneously , we keep track of the sample resistance . once the resistance reaches values in the order of 10  k@xmath0s we stop annealing and check the gate voltage dependence .",

    "<S> we report a change of three orders of magnitudes in the resistance of a suspended bilayer graphene flake which varies from a few k@xmath0s in the high carrier density regime to several m@xmath0s around the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding transport gap is 8  mev at 0.3  k. the sequence of appearing quantum hall plateaus at filling factor @xmath1 followed by @xmath2 suggests that the observed gap is caused by the symmetry breaking of the lowest landau level . </S>",
    "<S> investigation of the gap in a tilted magnetic field indicates that the resistance at the cnp shows a weak linear decrease for increasing total magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> those observations are in agreement with a spontaneous valley splitting at zero magnetic field followed by splitting of the spins originating from different valleys with increasing magnetic field . both , the transport gap and @xmath3 field response point toward spin polarized layer antiferromagnetic state as a ground state in the bilayer graphene sample . the observed non - trivial dependence of the gap value on the normal component of @xmath3 suggests possible exchange mechanisms in the system </S>"
