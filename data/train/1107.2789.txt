    "one often encounters a problem if in the given noisy experimental data some repeatable weak signal is hidden .",
    "if such signal is really very weak , even its existence in stochastic background data is difficult to confirm , not mentioning the challenge to describe its detailed properties .",
    "this problem is relevant not only in detector data analysis in many fields of physics but it is also important in other areas of human activity where data transmission , data collection and data processing is involved  just to mention : telecommunication , electronics , computer science , genetics , acoustics , astronomy , etc .",
    "the search for long - memory effects in the measured background noise is essential in proper determination of the conceivable periodic or just repeatable signal immersed in this noise .",
    "such search is also the first step to reveal and then to separate other sources of long - memory data which , if added to the measured background noise , may finally change its nature .    in this report",
    "we introduce the novel method to examine the presence of long - memory and autocorrelations in time series .",
    "the method is based on properties of random matrices ( rm ) eigenvalue spectra [ 1 - 3 ] , however , we use rm approach in the new context .",
    "usually , one applies rm to multidimensional time series of data , seeking for correlations between various @xmath0-dimensional subseries of these time series [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "this technique analyzes eigenvalues of the correlation matrix between @xmath0-dimensional subseries with the corresponding eigenvalues of wishart matrix [ 7,8 ] . in our approach",
    ", we propose to analyze eigenvalue spectra for matrix entries built entirely from increments of @xmath0-dimensional time series with no correspondence to wishart correlation matrix .",
    "the construction runs as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 is the @xmath0-dimensional cumulated time series with very large @xmath2 .",
    "the time series of its increments is thus @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "we divide @xmath3 into @xmath5 $ ] non - overlapping subseries @xmath6 of length @xmath7 each @xmath8)$ ] .",
    "every subseries is then renormalized according to : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the standard deviation of elements in @xmath11-th subseries .",
    "+ we build @xmath12 matrices from @xmath13 subseries treating them as subsequent matrix rows .",
    "the first @xmath7 subseries build the first matrix , the second @xmath7 subseries build the second matrix , etc .",
    "this way , the @xmath14 entry of the @xmath15 matrix @xmath16 ( @xmath17 $ ] ) reads in terms of time series increments as follows : @xmath18l+j}}{\\sqrt{l}\\sigma_{(n-1)l+i}}\\ ] ]    further steps rely on examination of eigenvalue spectrum properties for the ensemble of matrices built this way and on comparison these properties with some _ a priori _ known spectrum patterns .",
    "any distortion of the _ a priori _ known long range dependence in the background time series data will be classified as the presence of a new signal immersed in these data .",
    "the measurement of this distortion in terms of eigenvalue spectra for matrices built according to the scheme presented above , leads not only to discovery of a new immersed signal but may give us also some information on its parameters .",
    "let us look at the beginning , how this scheme works in the simplest case of white noise chosen as the background , enriched with the sinusoidal signal added at various signal to noise @xmath19 ( amplitude ) level has the meaning of ratio between the amplitude @xmath20 of the signal and the standard deviation @xmath21 of the noise data . ] . if @xmath22 , we simply should reconstruct the wigner semicircle [ 9 ] .",
    "the crucial observation is here that eigenvalue spectrum @xmath23 for eigenvalues @xmath24 normalized according to eq.(1 ) and obtained from non - correlated data should disappear for @xmath25 because of analytic formula describing the wigner eigenvalue spectrum semicircle :    @xmath26    this fact is confirmed numerically in fig.1 for the ensemble of @xmath27 matrices of size @xmath28 constructed from the pure white noise signal . increasing @xmath19 ratio",
    "we see the tails of @xmath29 spectrum becoming much longer and eventually , they exceed the wigner limit @xmath30 .",
    "+ we have checked also that obtained results do not qualitatively depend on period @xmath31 of the added signal . in plots of fig.1 period @xmath32 was used .",
    "let us turn to analyze an example of much more complicated but very realistic signal being of wide interest in physics and astrophysics .",
    "we examined the background noise data from nautilus experiment [ 11 ] , i.e. from one of ground placed detectors constructed to detect bursts of gravitational radiation coming from sources like spinning irregular neutron stars located in our galaxy or in the local group .",
    "the idea of nautilus and similar detectors was based on the relative change in macroscopic body sizes ( of cylindrical shape for the nautilus experiment ) while the hypothetical gravitational wave is passing through it . the relative change in sizes ( dimensionless amplitude ) up to @xmath33",
    "was expected to be observed by nautilus group .",
    "the experiment is no longer running since more modern approaches started data collection like virgo , ligo or are planned ( lisa ) .",
    "nevertheless , the use of data from nautilus seems to be important to show the efficiency of rm based method in comparison with the standard fourier analysis applied to examine such complicated signal .",
    "the latter analysis is usually the tool of the first choice in examination of periodic signal in background data what is exactly a case of gravitational wave signal hidden in a background noise of various origin .",
    "we took @xmath34 different samples of signals , every sample containing around @xmath35 records .",
    "first , the samples have been cleared of the obvious technical distortions ( major picks ) due to technological reasons , mainly the replacement of liquid argon cooling the cylinder placed inside the apparatus to minimize its thermal noise .",
    "they make time series @xmath36 of the real signal with the overall number of data exceeding @xmath37 .",
    "all examined signals were searched with matrices @xmath28 , but we checked that results do not significantly depend on the used matrix size .    the eigenvalue spectrum of matrices built on @xmath36 time series is plotted in fig.2 .",
    "it makes the characteristic triangle shape very much different from the semicircle form of eq.(3 ) .",
    "as one could have expected , the time series of shuffled experimental signal @xmath38 leads to different eigenvalue spectrum shape - the wigner one .",
    "this is also shown in fig.2 and confirms only strong correlations in @xmath36 data . however , there is nothing strange in this observation because detector is adjusted to get maximum sensitivity for specific frequencies of measured signal .",
    "nevertheless , there is one very striking phenomenon in data analysis shown in details in fig.3 .",
    "we compare here eigenvalue spectra for the real detector signal @xmath36 and the simulated background noise @xmath39 of the detector .",
    "the latter signal was used by nautilus group as the reference signal and any deviations from it should be a subject of careful experimental and theoretical analysis .",
    "one may see small difference between two spectra , particularly in the tail part .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum for the real signal is wider and heavy tailed comparing with the same spectrum for simulated noise .",
    "it is worth to say that this difference between two signals was not noticed in the standard fourier analysis performed by nautilus group .",
    "an importance of such difference , visible only within eigenvalue spectra approach , should be carefully examined , particularly in the spirit of tails modification caused by periodic signal found previously and shown in fig.1 for simplest signals .",
    "let us concentrate in the beginning on the simulated detector background noise @xmath39 enriched with a single sinusoidal signal at different @xmath19 ratio .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum for such compound is drawn in fig.4 .",
    "we notice that long tails appear in spectrum for such modified signal with local maxima whose position does not depend on the period of added signal .",
    "however , the shape of the tail part and its length does depend on the @xmath19 ratio .",
    "simultaneously , the central part of the eigenvalue spectrum ( maximum of the spectrum ) decreases with decreasing @xmath19 value .",
    "the above observation confirms the role of thick tails in the eigenvalue spectrum and points to the necessity of their exact test for the presence of additional sinusoidal signals , which after all might be hypothetical gravitational waves .",
    "indeed , the gravitational wave can be described as superposition of many sinusoidal signals with varying amplitude and periods [ 12 - 15 ] .",
    "it is described by many parameters defining the mutual angular position and distance of the source with respect to the wave observatory on the ground , orientation of rotation axes , rotation speeds , etc .",
    "most of these parameters are chosen randomly , since _",
    "_ we do not know the place in galaxy we can expect the arrival of the signal from .",
    "therefore , the exact shape of expected gravitational wave signal and the responded signal of detectors is the subject of monte carlo simulation [ 13 - 15 ] .",
    "depending on the choice of free parameters , one can get signals varying very much and having different impact on the relative sizes of a probe body .",
    "we took in our further simulations a model of the signal representing the quadrupole gravitational wave that is emitted by a freely precessing axisymmetric star [ 12 ] .",
    "two extreme detector respond signals with very much different amplitude were generated ] ( amplitude ratio of these signals was about one order of magnitude ) .",
    "we will call these respond signals respectively : strong and weak later on .",
    "their eigenvalue spectra are shown in fig.5 for completeness of our reasoning .",
    "they are more complicated than for a single sinusoidal signal but the central pick is well noticed in all cases what reflects the periodic nature of gravitational waves .",
    "finally , we checked how the presence of such real gravitational wave signal would change the eigenvalue spectrum of the respond signal from the detector if the simulated background noise of detector is also switched on .",
    "the outcomes of this simulation is presented in series of figs.6 - 8 .",
    "the magnitude of gravitational wave signal was kept constant in this simulation , while the level of background noise was the subject of correction @xmath40 times ( @xmath41 . we simulated this way the eigenvalue spectrum of the entire respond signal expected from the detector in different cases of background noise reduction .",
    "this scenario is expected to come true in ground based experiments in near future .",
    "it is seen that in approach based on eigenvalue spectrum , the strong signal of gravitational wave passing through the earth is going to be detected already at the present sensitivity of nautilus detector @xmath42 ( see figs.6 - 8 ) . the weaker respond signal can be found if the background noise level is reduced @xmath43 times ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "the positive respond signal of gravitational wave will most easier be seen in both cases by modification of the tail and head part in the eigenvalue spectrum as indicated in figs.7 - 8 .",
    "concluding , we presented a novel approach in detection of repeatable signals in noisy data .",
    "our analysis was focused on the real noisy data obtained from nautilus gravitational wave experiment , as an example . in order to get in future unambiguous experimental evidence of gravitational waves ,",
    "one has to apply independent methods , based on various theoretical philosophies .",
    "new approach we proposed is based on rm techniques .",
    "it revealed an existing subtle difference between the simulated detector noise and truly recorded background signal .",
    "this difference was not evident so far with the use of other techniques like fourier analysis and has to be eliminated if very weak gravitational waves signal is going to be crosschecked by independent and diversified methods of data analysis .",
    "moreover , we provided also the eigenvalue spectrum of the entire respond signal expected from ground based detector in future experimental activities , by diminishing its background noise level .",
    "we believe that the good performance of our method in the latter case is a good predictor of further applications in many other areas as well .",
    "authors would like to thank a. krlak for helpful discussion and nautilus group for delivery the samples of experimental data and the background signal of the nautilus detector for the purpose of this elaboration .",
    "authors thank also m. daszkiewicz for suggesting the problem and contacting us with gravitational wave researchers .",
