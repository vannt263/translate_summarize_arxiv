    "the details of stellar mass assembly are crucial for a full understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "most of the present - day stellar mass in massive galaxies was already in place at @xmath8 , and the bulk of stellar build - up apparently took place at @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a population of starbursting galaxies at @xmath10 that have been popular candidates to be the progenitors of the most massive galaxies present at @xmath11 are the so - called submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; @xcite ) identified by submm and mm surveys at @xmath12 m ( @xcite ) . with large infrared luminosities ( l@xmath13l@xmath14 ) that translate into star - formation rates of sfrs @xmath15 m@xmath14 yr@xmath3 @xcite , smgs could build the stellar bulk of a massive galaxy in under a few hundred million years @xcite .",
    "deep long - slit spectroscopic h@xmath0 observations of a large sample ( @xmath16 ) of smgs with the keck instrument nirspec have provided crucial constraints on star formation rates and dynamical masses of this population ( sfr@xmath17 m@xmath18 yr@xmath3 , m@xmath19  m@xmath18 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies reported the presence of broad balmer line emission ( fwhm@xmath20  km  s@xmath3 ) in a large fraction of smgs ( @xmath21 ) , suggesting a direct view to the randomly moving high - velocity gas within the broad - line region of a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "parallel studies at other wavelengths have revealed a mixture in the astrophysical nature of the underlying power sources in smgs .",
    "exploiting deep chandra x - ray observations , @xcite show that @xmath22% smgs host an agn .",
    "however , agn activity has been shown not to dominate the smg bolometric luminosities ( @xcite based on x - ray observations ; @xcite , @xcite based on the mid - ir ) .",
    "high - resolution vlbi radio studies of smgs have also given us insight to the underlying agn activity in smgs @xcite .",
    "when both agn and star formation activity co - exist , long - slit spectroscopic techniques face difficulties in disentangling their independent contributions .",
    "estimates of sfr and dynamical mass based on h@xmath0 line information in smgs thus retain the substantial caveat that in the presence of an agn , the blended nuclear emission may result in the broadening and brightening of the h@xmath0 emission , potentially leading to agn - contaminated measurements . without spatially - resolved information , it is difficult to disentangle the agn contribution from the nebular emission .",
    "integral field spectroscopy opens the possibility of investigating the properties of nebular emission at different scales , providing the spatially - resolved information to allow a distinction in spectral properties across a galaxy .",
    "furthermore , considering that dynamical information has proved difficult to extract from long - slit data @xcite , even for the less extreme and likely more ordered cases of optically - selected lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at similar redshifts ( @xcite ) , an integral spectroscopic insight to the line emission is also the only viable probe of the distribution and dynamics of the gas in the inner galaxy .",
    "results from the spectrometer for infrared faint field imaging ( spiffi ) on the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) first showed how two - dimensional ( 2d ) marginally resolved seeing - limited spectroscopy could already reveal structure in line emission across an smg at @xmath23 , smmj14011 + 0252 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thereafter , a number of studies using integral field spectrographs at the vlt , gemini and ukirt telescopes have explored the spatial distribution and velocity fields of h@xmath0 emission in a handful of smgs @xcite .",

    "nicmos / acs imaging of 25 smgs has revealed a mix of morphologies from compact , single - component to clumpy extended structures @xcite , either due to structured dust extinction on a smooth disk distribution or star formation activity concentrated in clumps .",
    "evidence for clumpy star formation is not limited to smgs but has also been observed in the rest - frame uv / optical continuum of less extreme star - forming galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "spatially - resolved observations of the ionized gas have provided insight to the underlying kinematics to help discern between a clumpy - disk and a merger scenario ( e.g. , keck / osiris : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; vlt / sinfoni : @xcite ) .",
    "recent ifu work by @xcite with the gemini - nifs and vlt - sinfoni instruments reveals the predominance of clumpy structure in a sample of 9 smgs at @xmath24 characterized by multiple galactic - scale subcomponents with an average projected separation of @xmath25kpc and velocity offsets of @xmath26 km s@xmath3 reminiscent of merging systems .",
    "even higher internal velocities up to @xmath27 km s@xmath3 are identified by @xcite in a sample of 8 smgs at @xmath28 , but these are based on [ oiii ] line emission and attributed to large - scale agn outflows .    a theoretical framework for the formation of clumpy structures at high redshifts is actively being developed in recent years , with merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) and disk fragmentation simulations successfully reproducing the observational evidence ( e.g. , @xcite ) . within the latter scenario , disk fragmentation into giant clumps results from gravitational instabilities triggered by disk - wide turbulence due to rapid gas cooling .",
    "the otherwise smooth rotation pattern expected for rotating disks is highly distorted by the velocity offsets of the bright clumps @xcite .",
    "this  clumpy stage \" is a short - lived phase in the evolutionary scenario of disk galaxies , where disk fragmentation is rapidly followed by clump migration to the center of the galaxy building the central bulge in only a few @xmath29 yr .",
    "@xcite propose a slightly different scenario where clumpy disks persists for a longer term and are thus more prevalent in the observed population of high - redshift galaxies . within this scenario",
    "cold flows provide a continuous and rapid stream of smooth and clumpy gas along galactic - scale filaments that feed galaxy star formation , keeping the disk gravitationally unstable without destroying it .",
    "in this paper we present the first integral field spectroscopic observations of smgs aided with laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs - ao ) , unveiling spatially - resolved details on the clumpy structure in smgs .",
    "we use the oh - suppressing infrared imaging spectrograph ( osiris ; @xcite ) on the keck ii telescope to study the h@xmath0 emission in three smgs in the redshift range @xmath30 .",

    "lgs - ao allows for atmospheric distortion corrections to be derived from parallel observing of a spatially coincident laser excited sodium beacon in the upper atmosphere and thus enables close to diffraction - limited resolution in ground - based observations . at the typical redshifts of smgs , @xmath42 @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to kpc - scale spatial resolution .",
    "our targets are from the radio - identified sample of smgs in @xcite .",
    "we selected our science targets carefully to optimize osiris observations , including h@xmath0 signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , low sky - line contamination and performance of ao - correction .",
    "we took advantage of existing near - ir long - slit h@xmath0 spectroscopy to select smgs with the brightest h@xmath0 lines , @xmath43 erg s@xmath3 @xmath44 @xcite to maximize detection s / n with osiris . with redshifts in hand we selected smgs for which the redshifted h@xmath0 emission does not fall on bright oh sky emission lines , in order to minimize sky contamination .",
    "since the lgs - ao system requires the presence of a relatively - bright ( @xmath45 ) star within @xmath46 of the science target in order to derive ao - corrections , we selected smgs with such nearby @xmath47-@xmath48 stars ( hereafter , tt - star ) .",

    "however , we note that by selecting galaxies that are particularly bright in h@xmath0 compared to the rest of the smg population , we introduce an important bias favoring smgs with strong emission lines and likely hosting agn . incidentally , all three smgs in our sample display agn signatures either in the near - ir , the mid - ir or x - rays .",
    "we discuss these individually in section[individual ] .",
    "our osiris observations include a combination of the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 lenslet - scales , which provide the largest fields of view ( fov : @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ) and also have the advantage of allowing us to maximize the s / n per lenslet , crucial for the study of faint sources .",
    "the science integrations comprise sets of standard abba sequences , each comprising four @xmath55minute frames taken at two positions separated by @xmath56 to allow for on - object dithering .",
    "we followed each of these sets by a dedicated - sky integration frame , offset by @xmath57 from the science target . in table",
    "[ obstab ] we provide details of the observing setup for each of our targets .    to process our data we used the osiris data reduction system pipeline , which comprises a collection of individual idl modules , each performing a specific task to ultimately extract each lenslet s spectrum from the _ raw _",

    "the result is a 3d data cube with two spatial axes ( @xmath58 ) and a third axis for wavelength ( @xmath59 ) , calibrated according to the corresponding rectification matrix available for the particular filter and lenslet - scale .",
    "we improve the sky subtraction by subtracting a supersky 2d image from our science cubes .",
    "the supersky image results from median - combining the pipeline - processed sky cubes and collapsing these along the @xmath59-range around the redshifted h@xmath0 wavelength ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we also subtract the median flux level within each wavelength channel in the science cubes to eliminate the residual background plateau . finally , we applied the sky - subtraction routine developed by @xcite , specifically tailored for near - ir integral - field spectra taking into account the temporal variations in absolute fluxes of oh - lines as well as in their individual fluxes relative to each other .",

    "to @xcite and @xcite , we convolve the individual image frames at each wavelength channel with a 2d gaussian kernel ( fwhm@xmath65 pixels ) in an effort to improve the s / n while remaining below the spatial resolution limit of our observations as determined by our psf ( fwhm@xmath66 ) , measured from the tt - star peak up imaging . for smm j123549.44 and smm",
    "j163650.43 we also smooth the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra at each spatial pixel with a 2- and 5 - wide gaussian kernel , respectively , to better distinguish the line emission from the underlying noise .    imposing a set of line - search thresholds for h@xmath0 line - width ( @xmath67 km s@xmath3 ) , s / n with respect to an off - source region ( @xmath68 ) and velocity offset relative to the long - slit h@xmath0 redshift ( @xmath69 km s@xmath3 ) for our targets from @xcite , we fit single gaussian profiles to fit the h@xmath0 line emission along the dispersion direction at each spatial pixel .",
    "we use the collection of these gaussian fits , in particular the central wavelength and the line width ( corrected for instrumental width ) at each spatial pixel , to construct an h@xmath0 velocity map , reflecting the relative spectral position of the line centroids , and an h@xmath0 line - width map characterizing the velocity dispersions of the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "note that only the gaussian fits complying with our imposed thresholds are used for the velocity and line - width maps , while other ones are disregarded ( i.e. , empty pixel in the resulting maps ) .",
    "the selection of these s / n , velocity and line - width thresholds were not established a priori , but tuned carefully to each object , in order to eliminate spurious elements from the resulting maps .",
    "we produce h@xmath0 intensity maps by collapsing the final science data cube along the dispersion direction , stacking the science data cube s flux over a range @xmath70 km s@xmath3 centered at the redshifted h@xmath0 line . in figs.[c3_15maps2 ] , [ 12t1maps2 ] , [ 16t3maps2 ] we show h@xmath0 velocity and line - width maps with overlaid h@xmath0 intensity contours for smm j030227.73 , smm j123549.44 , and smm j163650.43 , respectively .",
    "we oversample these maps by a factor of 2 to improve their visual appearance .",

    "we flux calibrate the h@xmath0 line emission in our osiris observations using as a reference the h@xmath0 line fluxes from long - slit spectroscopy by @xcite , where slit loss correction has been performed based on @xmath71-band images .",
    "we set the galaxy - integrated long - slit h@xmath0 fluxes equal to the integrated osiris flux resulting from collapse of the science cube along the dispersion direction ( @xmath72 km s@xmath3 ) centered at the redshifted h@xmath0 line . by adopting this approach ,",
    "we ensure that we are not artificially boosting the h@xmath0 emission within the brightest clump regions . in principle , peak - up imaging of the tt - star for each science target is also a viable reference to perform absolute flux calibrations .",
    "however , we note that when using the ao technique , a large flux uncertainty arises from the imperfect channeling of light into the ao - corrected psf . following detailed modeling of this issue by @xcite ,",
    "the total flux uncertainty for the reference tt - star flux corresponds to _ at least _",
    "furthermore , because flux calibration requires also taking into account the spatial offset between the science target and the tt - star to consider the _ true _ psf at the science target location , the uncertainties in absolute flux calibration based on tt - star observations increase significantly .    in order to disentangle the diffuse h@xmath0 component ( @xmath74 ) from the compact one ( fwhm @xmath75 ) , we rely on a target - specific psf determined from peak - up imaging of the tt - star to subtract the compact region of high - s / n line emission from each map .",
    "this is particularly important considering the potential spread of emission beyond the ao - corrected psf that may escape the immediate regions of these high - s / n regions of emission . in this way",
    "we avoid potential contamination and ensure the best separation of the diffuse and compact h@xmath0 emission components .",
    "the psf - subtracted images that we use to investigate diffuse emission are shown on figs.[c3_15maps1 ] , [ 12t1maps1 ] , and [ 16t3maps1 ] for smm j030227.73 , smm j123549.44 , and smm j163650.43 , respectively .",

    "the line - width and velocity maps for each of our targets in figures [ c3_15maps2 ] , [ 12t1maps2 ] and [ 16t3maps2 ] allow us to probe for velocity offsets between distinct components in each system and for the presence of agns , as revealed by large line - widths ( fwhm @xmath76 km s@xmath3 ) . from these osiris observations we derive clump - integrated velocity dispersions ( @xmath64 ) , star - formation rates ( sfrs ) and star - formation rate surface densities ( @xmath77 ) .",

    "the bright , compact knot from the central source stands out at a @xmath90 with broad h@xmath0 emission ( @xmath91 km s@xmath3 ; see 1d spectrum in fig.[c3_15maps2 ] ) , while to the south - west direction fainter and diffuse narrow h@xmath0 emission appears at a lower , but still significant @xmath92 ( @xmath93 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of h@xmath0 line widths conforms with previous observations by @xcite where the bright central source was identified as an agn .",
    "however , since the spatial coverage of our observations does not properly extend out to the south - western knot shown in fig.[c3_15maps1 ] ( the shown contours are at the very edge of the osiris fov ) , we can not confirm the possibility of two agns within this system , as suggested by @xcite .",

    "note that this factor is significantly larger than the typical attenuation found for other high - redshift populations , such as the optically - selected lbgs , with attenuations of an average factor of 1.7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "prior to extinction correction , smg clumps have already large sfr surface densities with peak values @xmath147 ( see figs.[c3_15maps1 ] , [ 12t1maps1 ] , [ 16t3maps1 ] ) . after correcting for extinction in the manner we described , the peak sfr surface densities increase up to @xmath148m@xmath14 yr@xmath149kpc@xmath150 and the clump - wide sfrs reach values of up to 250 m@xmath14 yr@xmath3 . in fig.[sfrd ]",
    "we show the total sfrs and sfr surface densities as a function of the line velocity dispersions based on the clump - wide spectral extractions shown in figures [ c3_15maps2 ] , [ 12t1maps2 ] , [ 16t3maps2 ] , with the extinction - corrected values shown by the endpoints of horizontal arrows . for comparison , we include both kpc - scale and galaxy - wide measurements for optically- and near - ir selected galaxies at @xmath151 @xcite and for samples of low - redshift normal and starburst galaxies , compiled by @xcite .",
    "we also compare the distribution in sfr surface densities in our smg regions with that in low - redshift samples of normal galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts from @xcite and luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; l@xmath152l@xmath14 ) from @xcite .",
    "the smg clump - integrated sfrs extend over a large range of values ( sfr@xmath153m@xmath14 yr@xmath3 ) and are similar to the galaxy - wide values that have been attributed to lbgs @xcite and other high - redshift galaxies from the sins sample ( e.g. , @xcite ) , particularly when extinction correction is taken into account ( see left panel in fig.[sfrd ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that a trend exists between @xmath77 and h@xmath0 velocity dispersion in these high redshift galaxy populations , where the most intense star - forming regions are also those with the highest velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "on the right panel of fig.[sfrd ] we show that the smg clumps in our sample occupy the high end of this trend .",
    "although the smg clumps in this sample present a wide range of extinction - corrected sfr and @xmath77 values ( sfr@xmath154 m@xmath14 yr@xmath3 , @xmath155m@xmath14yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath150 ) , the average values that characterize the star formation activity in these ( @xmath156sfr@xmath157 m@xmath14 yr@xmath3 , @xmath158m@xmath14yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath150 ) is similar in intensity  though higher by a factor of 25 in some cases  to that found in other high - redshift populations ( e.g. , @xmath156sfr@xmath159m@xmath14 yr@xmath3 , @xmath160m@xmath14 yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath150 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the h@xmath0 velocity dispersions are significantly different , likely associated to the different mass ranges that these different galaxy populations correspond to . assuming that @xmath64 traces gas dynamics within virialized clouds and considering a typical clump size of 1 kpc , we determine clump dynamical masses in the range of m@xmath161 m@xmath14",
    ". these clump masses are @xmath162 orders of magnitude larger than the kpc - scaled stellar clumps uncovered by @xcite in the optically - selected sample of @xmath10 sins star - forming galaxies ( m@xmath163 m@xmath14 ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the relationship between sfr surface density and the ionized gas velocity dispersion is a consequence of star - formation self - regulation , where the mechanical energy of the starburst itself controls the local dynamics of the ionized gas .",
    "following @xcite , this relationship can be represented by a functional form involving the intensity of star formation with the velocities of the ionized gas to represent the energy injected into the ism surrounding the star - forming regions ( see curve in fig.[sfrd ] ) . within this context",
    ", the high velocity dispersions observed in our smg clumps are likely not the sole result of larger dynamical masses .",
    "they are likely a combination of differences in dynamical mass ranges and a reflection of the high pressures sustained by high local surface brightnesses , which in turn are likely due to the higher gas densities in smgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "compared to galaxies at low redshift , the right panel of fig.[sfrd ] shows that smg clumps have @xmath77 values @xmath164 orders of magnitude higher than those found in normal spirals ( @xcite ) , but which fall well within the range of starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "if we correct for extinction the @xmath77 in smg clumps are shifted at the most within a factor of a few from the range occupied by the typical local circumnuclear starbursts , similar to the range found in low - redshift lirgs @xcite .",
    "near - ir integral field spectroscopic observations have shown that h@xmath0 emission in smgs often hint to the presence of multiple spatially - distinct galactic - scale subcomponents within the central @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "with lgs - ao osiris we have been able to peer into these central regions , allowing us to zoom in further than these previous seeing - limited integral field observations .      in all three smgs of our sample",
    "we identify regions with distinct properties : regions with narrow h@xmath0 emission where star formation is likely taking place ; and regions with broad h@xmath0 emission , likely dominated by agn activity ( keeping in mind that outflows may also play a role : e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the narrow - h@xmath0 emission is concentrated in multiple clumps unresolved on @xmath162kpc scales , asymetrically distributed around the agn .",
    "these clumps suggest either one of the following scenarios : ( 1 ) these h@xmath0-bright regions correspond to distinct components in a disturbed system , as would be found in a merging system ; or , ( 2 ) we are picking out the high surface - brightness peaks of h@xmath0 emission in an underlying lower surface - brightness plane of emission  perhaps even a disk , as has been found in a sub - sample of massive optically - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath151 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find velocity offsets of @xmath166 _ few _ @xmath167 km s@xmath3 between distinct galactic - scale regions ( see figs.[c3_15maps2 ] , [ 12t1maps2 ] , [ 16t3maps2 ] ) . these velocity offsets could be explained by invoking a merger scenario ( see also @xcite ) , thus strengthening the conclusion derived from deep rest - frame optical hst - imaging that smgs are disturbed systems , likely corresponding to mergers ( @xcite ) . within this context the distinct components revealed by osiris could potentially be associated with the remnants of the pre - merger galaxies , that have not fully coalesced and still retain significant intrinsic velocities with respect to each other .",
    "this is the kinematic structure expected for the intermediate stages of a merging system ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that this is in agreement with @xcite , where they discuss the likelihood that the double - peaked co profiles observed in a sample of 18 smgs correspond to either a disk or a merger .",
    "taking into account estimates of gas masses and source sizes , they conclude that such high surface mass density would imply dynamical instabilities too powerful for a disk to survive .",
    "they thus conclude that the double - peaked nature of the co lines traces distinct gas - rich components undergoing a merger or arise from a disk collapsing under gravitational instability .",
    "on the other hand , the h@xmath0-bright clumps of emission that osiris picks out may correspond to distinct clumps within an underlying clumpy disk structure .",
    "this would be similar to the clumpy disks identified in face - on galaxies at somewhat lower redshifts ( @xmath168 : @xcite ) and the more recently identified stellar clumps in optically- and near - ir selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent studies have indeed suggested the presence of disk structures in a large fraction of smgs based on deep broad - band imaging k - band data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although these studies are unable to directly trace the kinematic structure of these objects , they may point to the possibility that smgs may correspond to a diverse population presenting a varied range of kinematic structures .",
    "considering that the broad - h@xmath0 emission in our smgs identifies a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) likely at the dynamical center of system , and the large masses and extreme star - forming properties of the smg clumps that are in turn asymmetrically distributed around the agn , it is unlikely that these all reside in a regular potential well structure .",
    "the merger interpretation is likely the most accurate scenario for the smgs in our sample , although the final test of whether an underlying disk structure is present will come from studies of the cold gas at the high spatial resolutions with alma .",
    "we find compact unresolved regions ( fwhm@xmath169 kpc ) of broad - line h@xmath0 emission that contribute a significant fraction ( @xmath170 ) to the galaxy - wide h@xmath0 emission .",
    "however , fainter narrow - line h@xmath0 emission extends over large spatial scales of @xmath6kpc ( see figs.[c3_15maps1 ] , [ 12t1maps1 ] , [ 16t3maps1 ] ) , with 1 - 2 kpc - sized h@xmath0-bright clumps indicating regions of particularly intense star - formation ( see linewidth maps in figs.[c3_15maps2 ] , [ 12t1maps2 ] , [ 16t3maps2 ] ) .",
    "spatially - extended sizes for the diffuse h@xmath0 emission have also been identified in the seeing - limited ifu observations presented by @xcite and @xcite , who report resolved nebular emission on scales from @xmath171kpc for a combined sample of 12 smgs .",
    "evidence of spatially - extended emission in smgs has also been found at longer wavelengths . in high - resolution observations of a range of co transitions",
    "@xcite and radio continuum @xcite , linear sizes in the range of @xmath172kpc have been identified based on median angular - averaged fwhm sizes , with sample median sizes of @xmath173kpc .",
    "high - resolution radio continuum observations by @xcite also unveil spatial extensions with a linear diameter out to @xmath174kpc , while a high - resolution far - ir study by @xcite reveal far - ir emission extending out to spatial scales in the range of @xmath175 kpc .    the similarity in ir luminosities between local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ;",
    "l@xmath176l@xmath14 ) and high - redshift smgs , as well as the presence of agn signatures in both populations have naturally motivated direct comparisons and discussions of their possible correspondence within the formation and evolution scenario of today s most massive spheroids . to a somewhat still controversial degree , the sizes of smgs also play a role in this debate .",
    "high - resolution studies of the co and nebular emission in smgs have concluded that smgs have _ compact _ sizes @xcite , although often with companions with an average separation of @xmath177 @xcite , while other studies have demonstrated the presence of more _ extended _ spatial extensions @xcite .",
    "the former argues for a similarity with local ulirgs , which are found to be compact with sizes @xmath178kpc ( in the mid - ir , @xcite ; and in co , @xcite ) ; the latter argues for a sharp difference with local ulirgs .",
    "however , an important role in this controversy has been played by the tenuous definition of what is _ compact _ with respect to what is _ extended _ ; particularly in the case of a clumpy system , as we find in smgs .    in the light of our osiris observations , together with these previous findings ,",
    "it is clear that the smg population displays a range in spatial extensions that are often significantly larger than those of local ulirgs . on the other hand , smgs share similar star formation intensities with lirgs ( see fig.[sfrd ] ) , which are still within the range of extremely active environments , yet within a somewhat lower ir luminosity bin than ulirgs .",
    "lirgs have also been found to display rest - frame optical line emission over large spatial scales ( @xmath179 kpc ; @xcite ) as well as mid - ir extra - nuclear emission @xcite , both indicative of extended star - formation .",
    "we emphasize that evidence for extended star formation at high redshifts is not limited to smgs .",
    "some of the brightest and most massive lbgs do appear to have comparable h@xmath0 spatial extensions ( @xmath180kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "our results indicate that the smg clumps in our sample have high surface densities of star formation activity , close to those found in local extreme environments , such as in circumnuclear starbursts and luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "however , considering the much greater spatial extents found for these smgs ( @xmath181kpc ) in comparison to the 1-kpc sized nuclear starbursts @xcite , smgs appear to be undergoing this intense activity on much larger spatial scales .",
    "the advent of integral field units ( ifus ) in large - aperture optical telescopes has pushed detailed galaxy kinematic studies out to the high - redshift realm .",
    "we present the first integral - field spectroscopic laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs - ao ) observations of submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "the osiris instrument on keck with lgs - ao allow us to separate spatial and spectral information at sufficiently high spatial resolutions to determine sfrs from h@xmath0-bright regions uncontaminated by the broad - line emission associated to agn activity and to explore the internal dynamics of these complex systems .",
    "our main results are the following : @xmath182 we spatially distinguish between the compact broad - h@xmath0 emission ( fwhm@xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath183 kpc ) associated with an agn and the multiple 1 - 2 kpc - sized narrow - h@xmath0 clumps of emission associated with star formation , asymetrically distributed around the agn .",
    "this had remained unachievable in prior long - slit spectroscopic studies and seeing - limited ifu observations of smgs .",
    "@xmath182 we find that the h@xmath0 emission arising from the broad - line component may sometimes contribute up to @xmath16690% to the total h@xmath0 emission enclosed in the bright smg clumps , while the contribution from the individual stellar clumps varies from @xmath5 , with a median value of @xmath184 .",
    "these contributions do not translate directly to an agn and star - formation contribution to the total luminous output , since inhomogeneous dust extinction remains unconstrained at this stage .",
    "@xmath182 we do not find any indication of ordered global motion within our targets , as would be found in rotationally - supported disks .",
    "we find relative velocities of a _ few _ @xmath185 100 km s@xmath3 between the stellar clumps and the agn in our systems , suggesting that these smgs do not represent regular potential well structures , but are more likely in an intermediate merging phase .",
    "however , the final test of whether an underlying disk structure is present will come from detailed studies of the cold molecular gas at the high spatial resolutions possible with alma .",
    "@xmath182 smgs seem to display high sfr surface densities ( @xmath77 ) similar to those found in the most extreme local environments , such as circumnuclear starbursts and ir - luminous galaxies .",
    "however , because the narrow - line h@xmath0 emission spreads over large spatial extensions @xmath186kpc , this sets them in sharp contrast to local ulirgs .",
    "all of these results taken together suggest that the submillimeter phase denotes a short - lived flaring - up of large spatial extension across these systems that rapidly depletes the available gas through intense star formation .",
