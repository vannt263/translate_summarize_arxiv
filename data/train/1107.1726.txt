    "in this section we present in very general form the perturbative structure of the es and of the @xmath43 matrix , without relying on a particular example system and using only mild assumptions about the form of the hamiltonian .",
    "this also leads to a relatively general proof of boundary - locality , for low perturbation orders . we do not attempt or claim completeness of proof .",
    "our purpose is to show why boundary - locality is expected to hold as a general feature of the es in gapped phases connected to a product state .",
    "we consider the system hamiltonian to be of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a small parameter .",
    "the interaction is a sum of local terms , which we assume to be finite range but not necessarily single - site .",
    "the hamiltonian is translationally invariant ( @xmath80 @xmath81 ) , except at the system edges .",
    "the unperturbed ground state is taken to be a product state , as is true in all our examples .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian ( @xmath82 ) may be either single - site or finite - range  in our example systems , @xmath83 are single - site ( single - rung ) terms in the bose - hubbard chain and the heisenberg ladder , but of nearest - neighbor form in the xxz chain .",
    "we specialize to the generic case of a nearest neighbor interaction of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , @xmath86 are arbitrary operators acting on site @xmath87 .",
    "this includes a large class of models , including the bose - hubbard chain and the xxz chain .",
    "it is straightforward but cumbersome to generalize our results below to the case of next - neighrest - neighbor ( or generic finite range ) interactions , or to other local hamiltonians .    for simplicity , we write below only contributions arising from the @xmath88 term , and omit the terms or elements arising from the hermitian conjugate .",
    "( or , equivalently , we specialize to systems where @xmath88 is hermitian . ) again , including these contributions would be straightforward but cumbersome , and does not change any of the general conclusions below . for simplicity",
    "we will also assume that applying @xmath88 on the unperturbed ground state any number of times generates product states which are also eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath82 .",
    "the unperturbed product state @xmath89 has the simple schmidt decomposition @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , at order zero in perturbation theory , the @xmath43 matrix has only the single element @xmath91 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    + +    for first order perturbation theory , we can choose as basis for the @xmath0 subsystem the states @xmath92 and a corresponding basis set for the @xmath1 block .",
    "there are as many ` bulk ' states @xmath93 in this basis as there are bonds in @xmath0 .",
    "( @xmath94 is the normalization . )",
    "the two `` boundary states '' @xmath95 are defined such that @xmath96 i.e. , @xmath95 are the @xmath0(@xmath1 ) states produced when the perturbation @xmath97 acts across the boundary .",
    "we thus have a total of @xmath98 basis states , where @xmath99 is the number of bonds in block @xmath0(@xmath1 ) .",
    "[ our omission of the hermitian conjugate has simplified the number of `` boundary terms '' at first order . for a generic non - factorizable interaction of the form",

    "the idea here is that the @xmath93 states can be combined together as they all provide the same contribution .",
    "going to this new basis first for the @xmath0 block and then for the @xmath1 block , we get the ` shrinking '    @xmath107    so that the @xmath22 matrix can be written as @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 . this `` shrinking '' property holds in general : if @xmath22 has an isolated block with only one nonzero row or column , since its rank is trivially one it is possible to shrink the block to form a column or a row with only one nonzero element .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 written above has a @xmath111 block with the two schmidt ( singular ) values : @xmath112    in a first - order calculation , @xmath113 contributions to the schmidt values are not meaningful .",
    "the second singular value above is thus ` fake ' , and the @xmath111 block has rank 1 , up to meaningful order .",
    "the @xmath114 correction to the first singular value is also meaningless .",
    "thus , the @xmath115 appearing on the first row and column respectively do not give rise to any first order schmidt value since they contribute only at order @xmath114 .",
    "this illustrates in a general setting , not referring to a particular model , that matrix elements appearing on the same row or column as previous contributions which gave lower order es levels do not give new levels .",
    "such terms only contribute to a renormalization of @xmath116 .",
    "we note that these non - contributing terms originate from perturbative processes acting only on one of the two subsystems .",
    "in contrast , the element @xmath117 forms a separate block by itself , and thus contributes a new @xmath118 es level .",
    "this is an example of an element appearing perturbatively in a new row and new column of the @xmath43 matrix and giving rise to a new es level .",
    "this new es level comes from the boundary terms @xmath95 .",
    "we thus have proved in a very general setting that , at first order , bulk terms disjoint from the boundary do not contribute to the es and the only contribution comes from the boundary .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    + + +    at second order , we need to include extra basis states .",
    "all or most of these new states are formed by applying @xmath119 twice within the same block .",
    "this leads to a set of @xmath114 contributions which in the @xmath22 matrix fall on the same row or column as @xmath120 .",
    "as in first order , we can shrink these to a single new row and a single new column , and as in first order we can show that they do not provide any true es contributions at this order . again",
    ", bulk contributions are seen not to contribute to the es at low order .",
    "we omit such terms in the expressions written below .",
    "more interesting second - order contributions are those where @xmath119 acts once in @xmath0 and once in @xmath1 .",
    "this can be written within the basis set used previously for first order .",
    "the @xmath111 block of the @xmath43 matrix , discussed previously at first order , takes the form @xmath121 the singular values from this @xmath111 block are @xmath122 the extra value ( as well as the renormalization to @xmath91 ) is now relevant since it is of same order as the perturbation order .",
    "we thus can have a new contribution , but only if @xmath123 .",
    "this condition again reflects boundary locality .",
    "for second - order terms where the two applications @xmath124 occur away from the boundary in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and therefore away from each other , the contributions ` factorize ' into two first - order applications of @xmath124 ( encoded in the @xmath125 , @xmath126 terms ) . the physical processes that might cause @xmath123 are therefore applications of the perturbation connected to the boundary .",
    "( this intuitive argument is difficult to prove in full generality , but we have found it to hold in all the systems we have treated . ) in our example systems , we also find that such a second - order contribution also requires the unperturbed hamiltonian ( @xmath127 ) to be of longer range than single - site or single - rung terms .",
    "thus the xxz chain has such second order es levels , while the heisenberg ladder and the bose - hubbard chain lacks such second order levels , as can be seen from figures 1 and 3 in the main text .",
    "there are additional possibilities at second order , but they result in minor variations of the points discussed above .",
    "thus , also at second order in perturbation theory , contributions to the es are seen very generally to come only from boundary - connected processes .",
    "in this section , we describe perturbative calculations of the es in the spin-@xmath128 ladder with @xmath69 heisenberg interactions .",
    "we have performed calculations up to third order , but the expressions and notation become extremely cumbersome to write out , so we give details up to second order .",
    "all the physical points we want to demonstrate are already visible by this stage of the perturbative calculation .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - leg heisenberg ladder is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the coupling between spins on the same rung , and @xmath131 is the coupling along each leg ( figure [ fig : cartoon_ladder ] ) . the subscript @xmath87 indexes rungs , and ( 1),(2 ) refer to the two legs .",
    "open boundary conditions are used , so that there is a single boundary between the blocks , shown with a dashed line in figure [ fig : cartoon_ladder ] .",
    "the number of rungs is @xmath132 in block @xmath0 and @xmath133 in block @xmath1 ; total @xmath134 .",
    "we are interested in the limit @xmath135 where @xmath136 can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "we will use @xmath137 .",
    "the small parameter for perturbation is @xmath138 the eigenstates of the rung hamiltonian @xmath139 are conveniently expressed in terms of the single rung states .",
    "these are the singlet @xmath140 and the three triplets @xmath141 : @xmath142 the rung energy is @xmath143 for the singlet and @xmath144 for the triplets .",
    "the difference is @xmath145 .      to consider the result of applying @xmath136 on any state , it is convenient to know how @xmath136 acts on a pair of rungs : @xmath148 in the first row the sum is over @xmath149 and the sign function @xmath150 is @xmath151 if @xmath152 and @xmath153 for @xmath154 .     and @xmath1 regions is shown with a dashed vertical line .",
    "the rungs in block @xmath0 and @xmath1 are numbered from @xmath155 to @xmath132 and from @xmath156 to @xmath157 , respectively .",

    "the @xmath173 sector is more interesting .",
    "we choose the block bases @xmath174 where @xmath159 denotes the unperturbed state of that subsystem , and we defined @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the norm . as in section [ sec_general ]",
    "we are combining states from boundary - disconnected excitations into a single state , to ` shrink ' rows and columns of the @xmath77 matrix . with this choice",
    "the @xmath77 matrix in this sector has the form @xmath177 the isolated element @xmath178 gives the same contribution to the es as the @xmath179 sectors , completing the @xmath180 multiplet at @xmath181 .",
    "( lowest triplet in figure 3a of the main text ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath111 block has two singular values , but one of them is of higher than linear order in @xmath79 , and is thus a ` fake ' singular value that does not contribute to this order of the perturbative calculation . in other words ,",
    "the effective rank of the @xmath111 block , at the order being considered , is 1 .",
    "thus , we see here one example of the observation quoted in the introduction : since the first - order contributions @xmath184 appear on the same row or same column as the zeroth order element 1 , they do not lead to new es levels . on the other hand ,",
    "the isolated matrix element @xmath178 appears on a new row and new column , and therefore is allowed to give rise to a new es level , which it does .",
    "note that the ` fake ' eigenvalues are size - dependent : this reflects the physics that they arise from perturbations acting on the bulk and not those acting on an edge - connected location . to neglect terms like @xmath185 in the thermodynamic limit",

    "<S> excitations in the es are obtained by introducing domain walls near the boundary and by moving them into the bulk . from explicit perturbative calculations at the first few orders , we find that the only perturbation terms leading to new es levels are those which do one of the following : ( 1 ) create a pair of domain walls by applying @xmath29 across the boundary : @xmath38[\\u\\d{\\sigma}{\\sigma}\\dots\\quad\\leadsto\\quad \\dots{\\sigma}{\\sigma}\\underline{\\u\\u}][\\underline{\\d\\d}{\\sigma}{\\sigma}\\dots   \\ ; , \\ ] ] or ( 2 ) act twice , on the first bonds on either side of the boundary , again creating a domain wall pair : @xmath39[\\u\\d\\u{\\sigma}\\dots\\quad\\leadsto\\quad \\dots{\\sigma}\\underline{\\d\\d}\\u][\\d\\underline{\\u\\u}{\\sigma}\\dots\\ ] ] or ( 3 ) act twice symmetrically with respect to the boundary so as to move a domain wall on each block , each by two bonds away from the boundary . above , </S>",

    "<S> the first process changes @xmath36 by @xmath41 , while the others preserve @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary - locality of the es is encoded in the restriction that domain walls are created only through the first two processes above and not farther away from the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetrical pairwise application of @xmath42 ensures that the new contribution is to an element of the @xmath43 matrix that is not on the same row or column as a previous element that already led to a lower order es level .    </S>",
    "<S> given a domain wall configuration , the corresponding @xmath0 state belongs to the sector @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of domain walls in @xmath0 , @xmath46 $ ] labels those starting from the boundary , and @xmath47 is the position of the @xmath48-th domain wall measured from the cut . in our perturbative rules , the order at which a particular configuration appears is given by @xmath49 . </S>",
