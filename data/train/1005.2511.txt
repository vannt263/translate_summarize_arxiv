    "the muskat problem is a widely used model for the intrusion of water into oil sand .",
    "a linear analysis was performed in @xcite where a relation , the so - called rayleigh - taylor condition , was found to determine two regimes for the problem : a stable regime , when a flat interface is stable under small deviations , and an unstable one , when fingering occurs .",
    "nonetheless , existence and uniqueness of classical solutions has been firstly proven in @xcite by using newton s iteration method . in the last decade",
    "the problem has received more interest and was studied by means of complex analysis @xcite , energy estimates @xcite , power series expansions @xcite , or abstract parabolic theory @xcite .",
    "these different approaches cover a wide spectrum of questions related to the muskat problem : local well - posedness , global existence of solution , singular solutions , stability properties of equilibria .",
    "it is worth noticing that all these papers mentioned above consider the situation when there is only one moving boundary , namely the one separating the fluids .",
    "either one prescribes boundary conditions at two boundaries which are kept fixed during the flow or so - called far - field boundary condition are imposed .",
    "this setting corresponds to an abstract equation with only one unknown - the interface between the fluids . in the present paper",
    "we consider the more involved situation when there are two moving boundaries , one separating the two fluids and one separating the wetting phase from air ( assumed to be at uniform pressure equal to zero ) .",
    "the fluids are located in a porous medium ( or a vertical hele - shaw cell ) and are assume to fill together with the dry phase ( air ) the entire void medium . moreover , we incorporate gravity and viscosity effects into the modeling as well as surface tension forces at both interfaces .",
    "the invertibility of a bounded operator permits us to re - write the problem as an abstract non - autonomous evolution equation @xmath0 where the variable @xmath1 parametrises both unknown interfaces .",
    "the temporal variable @xmath2 is induced into the problem by the boundary condition @xmath3 for the pressure on the bottom of the cell .",
    "for this problem we find a generalised rayleigh - taylor condition in terms only of the boundary data @xmath3 , the viscosities @xmath4 , and densities @xmath5 of the fluids of the following form @xmath6 which determines the parabolic character of the problem in the absence of surface tension effects . when including surface tension forces at both interfaces we may drop condition .",
    "we steadily use in this paper the subscript @xmath7 for the fluid on the bottom of the cell and @xmath8 for that above . after showing that the frchet derivative @xmath9 generates a strongly continuous and analytic semigroup , parabolic theory provides local well - posedness of the problem and the principle of linearised stability",
    "may be applied to study the stability properties of the unique flat equilibrium which is determined for a fixed amount of fluid @xmath8 ( this quantity is preserved by the flow ) and a certain constant boundary data .    when considering surface tension effects at the interface between the fluids and the more dense fluid lies above we re - discover the global bifurcation branches obtained in @xcite which consist only of finger - shaped equilibria of the muskat problem .",
    "the exchange of stability theorem due to crandall and rabinowitz @xcite applies to this particular problem and we show that all small equilibria are unstable .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we describe in section 2 the mathematical model and present the main results .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to the proof of the well - posedness result theorem [ t : p1 ] , and in the subsequent section we analyse the stability properties of the unique flat equilibrium as stated in theorem [ t : p2 ] . in section 5",
