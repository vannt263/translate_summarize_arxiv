    "twenty five years ago aharonov , albert and vaidman published a paper entitled `` how the result of a measurement of a component of the spin of a spin-1/ 2 particle can turn out to be 100 ? '' @xcite .",
    "the authors idea was further developed a large volume of work on the so - called weak measurements ( see , for example , @xcite-@xcite ) , culminating in a somewhat bizarre the bbc report @xcite suggesting that `` pioneering experiments have cast doubt on a founding idea of the branch of physics called quantum mechanics '' .",
    "there seems to be room for discussion about what actually happens in a weak measurement , and this is the subject of this paper .",
    "some of the early and more recent criticisms of the original approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite can be found in refs .",
    "there appear to be only two possible answers to the original question posed by the authors of ref.@xcite : ( i ) there is a new counter - intuitive aspect to quantum measurement theory , or ( ii ) the proposed measurement is flawed . in this paper",
    "we will follow ref .",
    "@xcite in advocating the second point of view .",
    "the argument is subtle .",
    "there is no error in the simple mathematics of the ref .",
    "it is the interpretation of the result which is at stake .",
    "below we will argue that a weak measurement attempts to answer the which way? question without destroying interference between the pathways of interest .",
    "such an attempt must be defeated by the uncertainty principle @xcite , @xcite and the unusual weak values are just the evidence of the defeat .",
    "a random variable @xmath0 is fully described by its probability distribution @xmath1 .",
    "often it is sufficient to know only the typical value of @xmath0 , and the range over which the values are likely to be spread . to get an estimate for the centre and the width of the range ,",
    "one usually evaluates the mean value of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and the standard mean deviation @xmath3 .",
    "suppose @xmath0 can only take the values @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and its unnormalised probability distribution is @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we , therefore , have @xmath8/[\\rho(1)+\\rho(2)]\\approx 1.4761,\\\\ \\nonumber \\sigma % = \\{[<f>^2\\rho(0)+(1-<f>)^2\\rho(1)]/(\\rho(0)+\\rho(1))\\}^{1/2 } \\approx   0.4994,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reasonably well represent the centre and width of the interval @xmath9 $ ] containing the values of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose next that , for whatever reason , the unnormalised probabilities were allowed to take negative values , e.g. @xmath10 using the same formulas , we find @xmath11 which , clearly , no longer describe the range @xmath9 $ ] , - @xmath12 is too large , and @xmath13 is purely imaginary .",
    "the reason for obtaining such an anomalous mean value is that the denominator in eq.([n1 ] ) is small , while the numerator is not - hence the large negative expectation value in eq.([n3 ] ) . in general , the mean and the standard mean deviation of an alternating distribution do not have to represent the region of its support .",
    "these useful properties of @xmath14 and @xmath13 are lost , once a distribution is allowed to change its sign .",
    "to make things worse , let us assume that the unnormalised probabilities @xmath1 are also allowed to take complex values , @xmath15 while @xmath0 may take any value inside an interval @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "as before , we will construct a normalised distribution @xmath17 , which can now be written as a sum of its real and imaginary parts , @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "now we may wonder whether the value of @xmath20 would give us an idea about the location of the interval @xmath16 $ ] . from eq.([c2 ] ) we note that if both @xmath21 and @xmath22 do not change sign , @xmath23 is a proper probability distribution , and its mean certainly lies within the region of its support .",
    "if , on the other hand , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 alternate , the mean @xmath24 is allowed to lie anywhere , and is not obliged to tell us anything about the actual range of values of @xmath0 .",
    "so here is how a confusion might arise : suppose one needs to evaluate the average of a variable known to take values between @xmath4 and @xmath5 indirectly , i.e. , without checking whether the distribution alternates , or is a proper probabilistic one . obtaining a result of @xmath25 may seem unusual , until it is realised that the employed distribution changes sign , and scrambles the information about the actual range values involved .",
    "one remaining question is why was it necessary to employ such a tricky distribution in the first place ?",
    "a chance to employ oscillatory complex valued distribution is offered by quantum mechanics , and for a good reason . consider a kind of double - slit experiment in which a quantum system , initially in a state @xmath26 , may reach a given final state @xmath27 via two pathways , the corresponding probability amplitudes being @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "( i ) the pathways interfere , and the probability to reach @xmath27 is given by @xmath30 ( ii ) interference between the pathways has been completely destroyed by bringing the system in contact with another system , or an environment . now the probability to reach @xmath27 is @xmath31 the two cases are physically different , as are the two probabilities . in the second case",
    "the two pathways are @xmath32 .",
    "one can make an experiment which would confirm by multiple trials that the system travels either the first or the second route with frequencies proportional to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . in the first case the pathways remain @xmath35 .",
    "together they form a single real pathway travelled with probability @xmath36 , and there is no way of saying , even statistically , which of the two virtual paths the system has actually travelled .",
    "the above leads to a loose formulation of the uncertainty principle @xcite : several interfering pathways or states should be considered as a single unit .",
    "quantum interference erases detailed information about a system .",
    "this information can only be obtained if interference is destroyed , usually at the cost of perturbing the system s evolution , thus destroying also the very studied phenomenon , e.g. , an interference pattern in young s double - slit experiment .",
    "let us go about the pathways in a slightly more formal way . by slicing the time interval into @xmath37 subintervals , and sending @xmath37 to infinity ,",
    "we can write the transition amplitude for a system with a hamiltonian @xmath38 as a sum over paths traced by a variable @xmath39 , @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the variable of interest @xmath39 , @xmath43 . we also introduced feynman paths - functions which take the values @xmath41 from the spectrum of @xmath39 at each discrete time . in the limit @xmath44",
    "we will denote such a path by @xmath45 .",
    "the paths are virtual pathways , each contributing a probability amplitude @xmath46 $ ] defined in eq.([f1 ] ) . in the chosen representation they form the most detailed complete set of histories available to the quantum system",
    ". we may be interested not in every detail of the particle s past , but only in the value of a certain variable , a functional defined for a feynman path @xmath45 as an integral @xmath47= \\int_{0}^t \\beta(t ' ) a(t ' ) dt',\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a known function of our choice .",
    "we can define a less detailed set of virtual pathways by grouping together those paths for which the value of @xmath49 $ ] equals some @xmath0 .",
    "each pathway now contributes the amplitude @xmath50 ) a^{f\\leftarrow i}[path],\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the dirac delta .",
    "the new pathways contain the most detailed information about the variable @xmath52 , while information about other variables has been lost to interference in the sum ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "next we can define a coarse grained amplitude distribution for @xmath52 by smearing @xmath53 with a window function @xmath54 : @xmath55 with @xmath54 chosen , for example , to be a gaussian of a width @xmath56 we are unable to distinguish the values @xmath57 and @xmath58 less than @xmath56 apart , @xmath59 , since the corresponding pathways may now interfere .",
    "the coarse graining does , however , have a physical meaning .",
    "consider a basis @xmath60 containing our final state @xmath27 , and construct a state @xmath61 so that @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy to check @xcite that @xmath63 satisfies a differential equation , @xmath64 with the initial condition latexmath:[\\[\\label{f5 }    schroedinger equation describing a system interacting with a von neumann pointer @xcite whose position is @xmath0 . with it",
    "we have the recipe for measuring the the quantity @xmath66 $ ] : first prepare the system in the initial state @xmath26 and the pointer in the state @xmath67 . switch on the coupling , and at a time @xmath68 measure the pointer position accurately .",
    "interference between paths with different values of @xmath66 $ ] will be destroyed , since they lead do different outcomes for the pointer .",
    "our measurement scheme has an important parameter , the width of the window @xmath54 , @xmath56 , which determines the extent to which we can ascertain the value of @xmath66 $ ] , once the pointer has been found in @xmath0 .",
    "this accuracy parameter also determines the perturbation a measurement exerts on the measured system .",
    "this , in turn , can be judged by how much the probability to arrive in a final state @xmath27 with the meter on differs from that with the meter off .",
    "the former is given by @xmath69 and , in general , is not equal to @xmath70 since @xmath71 where the last equality is obtained by integrating eq.([f2 ] ) .",
    "the perturbation can be minimised by choosing @xmath54 to be very broad . by construction",
    ", the value of @xmath52 typically lies within a finite interval , say , @xmath72 \\le b$ ] , outside of which @xmath73 vansihes .",
    "a very broad @xmath74 can , therefore be replaced by @xmath54 , making the l.h.s . of eq.([w2 ] ) proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "thus , in order to study the system with the interference between the pathways intact , we must make a highly inaccurate weak measurement .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a high degree of uncertainty in the pointer s initial position .",
    "the following classical example may give us some encouragement .",
    "consider a classical system which can reach a final state by several different routes .",
    "let us say , a ball can roll from a hole @xmath76 to a hole @xmath77 down the first groove with the probability @xmath78 , or down the second groove , with the probability @xmath79 , and so on .",
    "it is easy to imagine a ( purely classical ) pointer which moves one unit to the right if the ball travels the first route , or two units to the right , if the second route is travelled , and so on .",
    "the meter is imperfect : we can accurately determine its final position , while we can not be sure that it has been set exactly at zero . rather , its initial position is distributed around @xmath80 with a probability density @xmath54 of a zero mean and a known variance .",
    "let there be just two routes .",
    "now the final meter readings are also uncertain , with the probability to find it in @xmath0 given by @xmath81 if the meter is accurate , i.e. , if @xmath54 is very narrowly peaked around @xmath82 , we will have just two possible readings , @xmath83 , in approximately @xmath84 out of @xmath37 trials , or @xmath85 , in approximately @xmath86 out of all cases .",
    "suppose next that the meter is highly inaccurate , and the width of @xmath87 , @xmath56 is much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "a simple calculation shows @xcite that the first two moments of the final distribution are given by @xmath88 we have , therefore , a very broad distribution , whose mean coincides with the mean of the @xmath89 . since the second moment of @xmath87 is known , by performing a large number of trials we can extract from the data also the variance @xmath13 of @xmath89 . for instance , if the two routes are travelled with equal probabilities , @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 from this we can correctly deduce that there are just two , and not three or four , routes available to the system , and that they are travelled with roughly equal probabilities .",
    "this simple example shows that , classically , even a highly inaccurate meter can yield limited information about the alternatives available to a stochastic system .",
    "it is just a matter of performing a large number of trials required to gather the necessary statistics .",
    "next we will see whether this remains true in the quantum case .",
    "in the quantum case , employing an inaccurate meter has a practical advantage - we minimise the back action of the meter on the measured system , and may hope to learn something without destroying the interference . as discussed in sect .",
    "vi , we can make a measurement non - invasive by giving the initial meter s position a large quantum uncertainty ( that is to say , we choose a pure meter state broad in the coordinate space ) .",
    "we prepare the system and the pointer in a product state ( [ f5 ] ) , turn on the interaction , check the system s final state , and sample the meter s reading provided this final state is @xmath27 . from ( [ f4 ] )",
    "the moments of the distribution of the meter s readings are given by @xmath92 as the width of the initial meter s state @xmath93 tends to infinity , assuming @xmath94 we have @xcite @xmath95 and @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a factor of order of unity , which depends only on the shape of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "and we have introduced the notation @xmath98 for the @xmath99-th moment of the complex valued amplitude distribution @xmath100 defined in eq.([f2 ] ) , @xmath101 it is at this point that improper averages ( [ ww5 ] ) evaluated with oscillatory distributions enter our calculation , originally set to evaluate proper probabilistic averages ( [ ww2 ] ) .",
    "expressions similar to eq.([ww2 ] ) have been obtained earlier in @xcite for a weak von neumann measurement and in @xcite for the quantum traversal time .",
    "they are the quantum analogues of the classical eqs.([i2 ] ) .",
    "we see that the quantum case turned out to be different in one important aspect . where the inaccurate classical calculation of the previous section yielded the mean of the _ probability distribution _",
    ", its quantum counterpart gives us the mean evaluated with the _ probability amplitude _ @xmath102 .",
    "there is no _ apriori _ reason to expect that either its real or imaginary part does not change sign . as discussed in sects .",
    "ii and iii , such averages are not obliged to tell us anything about the actual range of a random variable . thus , our attempt to answer the which way? ( which @xmath0? ) question is likely to fail , as we are not able to extract the information about the alternatives available to a quantum system .",
    "but we have been warned : the uncertainty principle suggests that , for as long as the pathways remain interfering alternatives , the question we ask has no meaning .",
    "to give our approach a concrete example , we return to the double slit experiment .",
    "consider a two - level system , e.g. , a spin-1/2 precessing in a magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the larmor frequency , and @xmath105 is the pauli matrix .",
    "we assume that the spin is pre - selected in a state polarised along the @xmath106-axis at @xmath107 , and then post - selected in the same state at @xmath108 .",
    "we also wish to know the state of the spin half - way through the transition , at @xmath109 .",
    "we follow the steps outlines in sect .",
    "v. at any given time , and in the given representation , the spin can point up or down the @xmath106-axis .",
    "we label these two sates @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "feynman paths are , therefore , irregular curves shown in fig . 1 .    the functional @xmath112 is given by eq.([f1a ] ) with @xmath113 , @xmath114 thus , we combined the feynman paths ending in the state @xmath110 at @xmath108 into two virtual pathways , one containing the paths passing at @xmath109 through the state @xmath110 , and the other - the paths passing through the state @xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding probability amplitudes are those for evolving the spin freely from its initial state to @xmath110 or @xmath111 at @xmath109 , and then to the final state @xmath110 at @xmath108 , @xmath115 we will need a meter .",
    "the interaction @xmath116 corresponds to a von neumann measurement @xcite of the operator @xmath117 performed at @xmath109 .",
    "the accuracy of the measurement depends on the width @xmath56 of the initial meter s state , which we will choose to be a gaussian , @xmath118 it is easy to check that the average meter reading @xmath14 in eqs.([i2 ] ) is given by @xmath119 its dependence on @xmath56 shown in fig.2 .",
    "this is , of course , an oversimplified version of the young s double slit experiment : the states at @xmath109 play the role of the two slits , and the states at @xmath108 - the role of the positions on the screen where an interference pattern is observed .",
    "consider first a strong measurement of the slit number .",
    "choose the final time such that finding the freely precessing spin in the state @xmath110 is unlikely ( our interference pattern has there a minimum , or a dark fringe ) , say @xmath120 . sending @xmath121 , for the probability distribution of the meter s readings we have [ cf .",
    "eq.([w1 ] ) ] @xmath122 we observe that the two pathways are travelled with almost equal probability , and eq.([d3a ] ) gives us the mean slit number @xmath123 however , this is not the original spin precession we set out to study .",
    "the interference pattern has been destroyed and the probability to arrive at the final position @xmath110 , which without a meter was latexmath:[\\[\\label{d5 }    this is a textbook example which illustrates the uncertainty principle : converting virtual paths into real ones comes at the cost of loosing the interference pattern .",
    "not satisfied , we try to minimise the perturbation in the hope to learn something about the route chosen by the system with the interference intact .",
    "we send @xmath56 to infinity , and after many trials obtain the answer : the mean number of the slit used is @xmath125 which brings us back to our original question , to rephrase the title of ref.@xcite , `` how the result of measuring the number of the slit in a double slit experiment can turn out to be @xmath126 ? ''",
    "we have tried to evaluate the mean number of the slit a particle goes through in a double slit experiment , and came up with the number @xmath126 .",
    "the mathematics is straightforward , and we need to understand the meaning of this result before employing the weak measurements elsewhere .",
    "there are just two slits , numbered @xmath4 and @xmath5 , so the result looks a bit strange .",
    "has our measurement gone wrong , or is the quantum world so strange that there are slits we are not aware of ?",
    "we opt for the first choice .",
    "wrong measurements are common in classical physics",
    ". they can be made and repeated , but only have meaning within the narrow context of the wrong experiment itself .",
    "a broken speedometer will read @xmath127 m.p.h each time the car goes at @xmath128 m.p.h , and might convince the driver , but not the traffic policemen who stops him for speeding .",
    "the slit number @xmath126 may come up in a weak measurement , but can not be used for any other purpose , such as convincing a potential user that the screen he is about to buy has more than two holes drilled in it .",
    "there is , however , one important distinction .",
    "classically , one can always find the right answer and correct , or re - calibrate the errant speedometer .",
    "quantally , it is not so .",
    "according to the uncertainty principle , there is no correct answer to the question asked .",
    "the nearest classical analogy might be this .",
    "suppose a ( purely classical ) charge can be transferred across one of the two lead wires , and an observer can measure , which one has been chosen .",
    "then the wires are heated up and melted into one .",
    "which of the two wires has the charge gone through now ?",
    "this is what interference does , it melts the pathways through the two slits into a single one , thus depriving the which way? question of its meaning .",
    "having started to use analogies it is difficult to stop . here is the last one : one asks a manager a question the said manager is unable or unwilling to answer properly . yet",
    "an answer he / she must give .",
    "the answer ( or no - answer ) given will have little to do with what one wants to know .",
    "it will be repeated should the question be asked again .",
    "it should nt , however , be used to draw further conclusions about the matter of interest .",
    "the weak measurements rely on an interesting interference effect which has applications beyond measurement theory @xcite , @xcite",
    ". they can be made , and have been made in practice @xcite .",
    "they have useful applications in interferometry @xcite .",
    "however , their results should not be over - interpreted .",
    "bizarre weak values indicate the failure of a measurement procedure under the conditions where , according to the uncertainty principle , it must fail .",
    "seen like this , the  weak measurements loose much of their original appeal , and the calculation of weak values reduces to a simple exercise in first order perturbation theory . finally , throughout the paper we appealed to the uncertainty principle , seen as one of the basic axioms of quantum theory .",
    "it is possible that the principle itself will be explained in simpler terms within a yet unknown general theory .",
    "however , we argue , that the weak measurements have not yet given such an explanation , nor provided any deeper insight into physical reality .",
