    "if there is a nonzero asymmetry after correcting for backgrounds , the assumption is that it is coming from neutral @xmath2-meson mixing , i.e. , the dimuon charge asymmetry of semileptonic @xmath2 decays @xmath23 this can occur , for example , when the @xmath1 quark decays semileptonically directly @xmath24 , but for the @xmath25 quark , there is first a @xmath2-meson oscillation before the semileptonic decay , i.e. , @xmath26 . another way to measure",

    "this asymmetry has contributions from both the cp - violating semileptonic asymmetry @xmath35 for @xmath28 and @xmath4 for @xmath3 oscillations : @xmath36 the analysis is redone for various conditions on the impact parameters of the muons resulting in different values for the coefficients @xmath37 allowing for the extraction of the specific asymmetries @xmath35 and @xmath4 , albeit with a high degree of correlation : @xmath38    a cpt - violating effect in @xmath2-meson mixing was predicted some time ago , @xcite and the  system is of particular interest for studies of cpt violation because several complete particle - antiparticle oscillations occur within a meson lifetime @xcite . a measure of cpt violation is given by the inclusive ` right - charge ' muon charge asymmetry @xmath39 of semileptonic decays of @xmath1 hadrons,@xcite @xmath40 assuming the only source of t violation is the sm contribution @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 averaging over sidereal time and the momentum ( @xmath43 ) spectrum , sensitivity to the spatial components @xmath44 is lost ; however , assuming that the only source of cpt violation comes from  mixing",

    "one can just integrate over decay time since the @xmath3 mesons oscillate very quickly and after very small decay times and lengths are ` fully mixed ' , i.e. , there are equal probabilities of observing a @xmath3 or @xmath49 despite the flavor at the time of production .",

    "the corresponding cpt asymmetry is essentially the _ same _ asymmetry since the necessary requirement of @xmath52 and @xmath53 is identical if the system is fully mixed , only requiring that the observed , raw asymmetry be corrected by the fraction of non - oscillated @xmath3 decays . to access all four components of @xmath54 , this asymmetry",

    "information is lost in the binning , so an unbinned analysis is also being performed in a periodogram@xcite that finds the power at a given scan frequency .",
