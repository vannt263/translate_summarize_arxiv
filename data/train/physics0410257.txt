    "the analytic description of spatial kerr solitons , initiated by the seminal paper of chiao et al.,@xcite has been continuously evolving in the last forty years.@xcite it basically hinges upon the use of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) , which in turn follows from the nonlinear helmholtz equation once the paraxial approximation , limiting the size @xmath0 of the propagating beam to values large compared to the wavelength @xmath1 , is introduced .",
    "this approximation becomes inappropriate if the beam size @xmath0 is comparable with @xmath1 , a regime where nonparaxial effects become important and are eventually able to provide a mechanism for avoiding nonphysical behaviors ( like , e.g .",
    ", catastrophic collapse ) in the beam evolution .",
    "although many contributions have been produced in this direction,@xcite they are typically based on some form of asymptotic expansion in the smallness parameter @xmath2 and are thus limited to the range @xmath3 . to overcome this limitation , we start _ ab initio _ from maxwell s equations and look for exact soliton solutions . more precisely , we solve maxwell s equations in the presence of a fully vectorial kerr polarizability and find a class of _ perfect optical solitons _ which inherently include all nonparaxial contributions .",
    "this is separately performed for one dimensional and two dimensional spatial solitons , both in the bright and dark configuration . in particular",
    ", the one dimensional case is dealt with by reducing maxwell s equations to a system of first order differential equations and handling it by appealing to the usual formalism employed in the frame of dynamical systems .",
    "our system is shown to posses a first integral so that its integrability is proved and the boundary value problem , associated with solitons , solved in closed analytical form .",
    "one the main results obtained in this paper is the proof of the existence of exact solutions of maxwell equations in the form of linearly polarized _",
    "one dimensional _",
    "kerr solitons : they do not suffer of any limitation on the value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( apart from the obvious ones associated with the validity of the macroscopic model of kerr polarizability ) and their existence curve can be numerically evaluated for all values of the beam intensity .",
    "both bright and dark solitons can be derived from an integrable system of equations and their existence curve shows that , in the case of bright solitons , any value of the peak intensity @xmath4 is allowed , while dark solitons can only exist if their asymptotic intensity @xmath5 does not exceed a threshold value completely determined by kerr coefficients . in correspondence to this threshold , their width approaches the minimum value of the order of a fraction of @xmath1 . in the _ two dimensional _ case ,",
    "dark azimuthally polarized solitons are found and their existence curve implies , the same threshold behavior of the one dimensional dark solitons .",
    "while one dimensional solitons reduce to the standard paraxial ones for small values of the intensity , the two dimensional azimuthal dark soliton is a completely new entity which has never been studied in the paraxial regime .",
    "we wish to note that the proof of the existence and derivation of exact solitons requires , in the one dimensional case , the use of a rather sophisticated mathematical analysis borrowed from the dynamical system formalism , which we decide to report in full in section 2 .",

    "the fact that @xmath26 does not generally vanish is a consequence of the vectorial coupling between transverse and longitudinal components which can not be rigorously neglected when describing spatially nonuniform fields , like for examples solitons ( from a physical point of view , this follows from the first maxwell equation setting the divergence of the electric field ) .",

    "this is evidently associated with the fact that , in an extremely narrow soliton , the longitudinal component of the electric field is as large as the transverse one .",
    "the above description of one dimensional bright and dark solitons is exact , no approximation having been exploited in their analytical derivation . as a consequence",

    "this has been done by showing that spatial solitons can be derived as exact solutions of maxwell equations ( thus making , within our approach , the term `` paraxial '' and `` nonparaxial '' redundant ) . in the one dimensional case , the _ perfect optical soliton _ represents the straightforward generalization of the paraxial one , the main difference being that dark solitons exhibit , unlike their paraxial counterpart , a specific upper limit for the possible values their asymptotic intensity can assume . in the two dimensional case ,",
    "the exact dark soliton is of a completely new kind , and the difference between paraxial and nonparaxial becomes rather meaningless . in any case , the comparison between paraxial and exact solitons , done , for example , by inspecting the relative existence curves , shows that our solitons are a definite entity , independent from used the approximation scheme : the transition between the paraxial and the highly diffractive regime is very smooth and does not exhibit any kind of dramatic catastrophic behavior , as implied by the standard paraxial theory .",
    "in order to tackle the problem of bright solitons existence we have to prove that the curve defined in eq.([bricon ] ) , with @xmath111 given by eq.([betasq ] ) , actually reaches the origin of the phase plane @xmath48 . to this end , it is convenient to introduce the polar coordinate defined by @xmath226 and @xmath227 , so that eq.([bricon ] ) becomes @xmath228 \\right .",

    "+ \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ ( 1-\\beta^2 ) \\cos^2 \\phi + \\beta^2 \\sin^2 \\phi \\right ] \\right\\ } = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is trivially satisfied by setting @xmath229 and this is consistent with the fact that the origin is in itself an orbit of eqs.([system2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the integral curve associated with solitons is described by the vanishing of the expression within the curly brackets . requiring that this curve reaches the origin yields @xmath230 where @xmath231 and @xmath111 has been obtained from eq.([betasq ] ) . for @xmath84 , the rhs of eq.([compbri ] ) is positive so that this equation can always be solved which , together with the fact that eq.([noncrossellipse ] ) is always satisfied for @xmath232 , implies that bright soliton exist in focusing media for any value of @xmath233 . in the case",
    "@xmath41 , the rhs of eq.([compbri ] ) is positive for @xmath234 so that , the curve actually reaches the origin .",
    "however , in this case , the curve joining the points @xmath71 and @xmath235 unavoidably crosses the ellipse @xmath236 since its semi - axis along the @xmath88axis is @xmath237 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath41 , a point belonging to the integral curve such that eq.([noncrossellipse ] ) fails to be satisfied always exists , with the consequence that , in defocusing media , bright solitons never exist .",
    "as already explained in section 2 , eqs.([q1 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) are necessary for dark soliton existence so that we have to find when they are also sufficient . from eq.([q1 ] ) ( with @xmath238 ) it is evident that solitons can exist for @xmath239 .",
    "the equation for the dark soliton integral curve on the phase plane ( eq.([levelset ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath68 given in eqs.([darkexist ] ) ) can be solved for @xmath240 thus yielding @xmath241 ^ 2           - \\left[\\frac{16}{9}u_x^2 - 4(1 - 2u_{x\\infty}^2)\\right ]           \\left [ 4u_x^6 -(1 + 6u_{x\\infty}^2)u_x^4 + 2u_{x\\infty}^2 u_x^2 - ( 1 - 2 u_{x\\infty}^2)u_{x\\infty}^4 \\right ] } }           { \\frac{8}{9}u_x^2 - 2(1 - 2u_{x\\infty}^2 ) } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which furnishes @xmath240 as a function of @xmath242 ( parametrically dependent on @xmath5 ) along the dark soliton integral curve . here , the plus sign between the two terms has been chosen in order to satisfy the boundary condition @xmath243 .",
    "evaluating eq.([uzsq ] ) at @xmath244 and taking the square root of the result we obtain the second of eqs.([darkexist ] ) , which is consistent with the boundary conditions since it satisfies the second of eqs.([q2 ] ) ( with @xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to prove soliton existence , we are left with proving that the curves in eq.([uzsq ] ) actually reach the point @xmath245 ( i.e. , with proving that the rhs of eq.([uzsq ] ) is a positive real number ) and that such curves do not cross the ellipse @xmath246 , thus leaving eq.([noncrossellipse ] ) satisfied .",
    "since the expression under the square root is always positive for @xmath247 , we have only to ensure that the rhs of eq.([uzsq ] ) is positive .",
    "it is not difficult to show that this is the case whenever @xmath248 imposing that the maximum of the polynomial in the lhs of this inequality is negative , we obtain the condition @xmath249 .",
    "the existence of dark solitons in this range for @xmath5 is finally proved by noting that any integral curve associated to these solitons globally lies within the ellipse @xmath250 , so that eq.([noncrossellipse ] ) is always satisfied .",
