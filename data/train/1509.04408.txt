    "let @xmath0 be the set of positive integers , @xmath1 , @xmath2 be the ring of rational integers , @xmath3 be the field of rational numbers , @xmath4 be the field of real numbers , @xmath5 be the field of complex numbers , respectively .",
    "the set @xmath6 can be regarded as pascal s triangle in the sense that each point @xmath7 corresponds to a binomial coefficient @xmath8 . in this paper , we prefer to make arguments on pascal s triangle in the form @xmath9 instead of the familiar form of an equilateral triangle .",
    "we consider the set @xmath10 for a prime number @xmath11 , of which the distribution of the points has been studied for a long time .",
    "it is classically known that the set @xmath12 has `` self - similarity '' as seen in figure 1 and figure 2 , where the points with a filled mark belong to @xmath12 .",
    "kummer @xcite first gave a criterion when a power of @xmath11 divides a binomial coefficient in terms of the expansion of non - negative integers in the base @xmath11 .",
    "we can determine which point @xmath7 belongs to @xmath12 by kummer s criterion , or by lucas formula on binomial coefficients appearing in section [ secmainb ] , which makes the argument simpler .",

''     in @xmath13,width=226 ]     in @xmath13,width=226 ]    essouabri @xcite introduced the zeta function associated to @xmath12 , defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 with the sufficiently large real part @xmath16 , the imaginary part @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are two - variable polynomials with real coefficients .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 is required to be `` @xmath20-elliptic '' to ensure the convergence ; @xmath21 $ ] is said to be @xmath20-elliptic if @xmath18 is non - constant and its highest degree part @xmath22 ( which means that @xmath22 is homogeneous and @xmath23 ) satisfies @xmath24 for every @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "essouabri showed several analytic properties of @xmath27 including the meromorphic continuation , the location of possible poles and the abscissa of absolute convergence .",
    "in particular , in the case @xmath28 , he proved an intriguing fact as follows .",
    "[ thess ] let @xmath29 .",
    "then the meromorphic function on the whole complex plane @xmath30 has at least two non - real poles on its axis of absolute convergence @xmath31 .",
    "( let `` the axis of absolute convergence '' represent the vertical line in the complex plane through the abscissa of absolute convergence . )    indeed , we only have to verify that @xmath30 has one desired pole since the second one can be obtained by using the schwarz reflection principle .",
    "recalling essouabri s proof of theorem [ thess ] , we note that a key role is played by some estimates for how fast the points in @xmath12 multiply .",
    "more precisely , certain estimates for an arithmetic function @xmath32 defined for @xmath33 are significant in his proof .",
    "actually , @xmath34 holds for @xmath35 at which @xmath30 converges absolutely and we would find that the wiener  ikehara theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * chapter 5 , corollary 1 ) for example ) would give the existence of the limit value @xmath36 if @xmath30 had no non - real poles on the line in question .",
    "however , this is in fact a contradiction to the known results on @xmath37 and @xmath38 , due to harborth @xcite , stolarsky @xcite , stein @xcite and wilson @xcite .",
    "( details will appear in section [ secprelim ] . )",
    "the purpose of this article is to show the results parallel to theorem [ thess ] in case @xmath39 and in case @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",

    "it is significant to consider @xmath46 in the context of fractal geometry .",
    "actually , it can be realized as the geometric zeta function of a certain fractal string with a scale transformation of @xmath47 .",
    "such a zeta function contains some geometric information of the fractal string in its poles , which are called the complex dimensions .",
    "in particular , important is the relationship between the existence of non - real poles on the axis of absolute convergence of the geometric zeta function and the minkowski measurability of the corresponding fractal string , which has some connection with the zeros of the riemann zeta function in the critical strip via spectrum theory .",
    "( for details , see @xcite for example . )",
    "we will prove theorem [ thgoal ] by imitating essouabri s proof in the following sections . to make the same argument as his",

    "those functions are defined as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath21 $ ] is a @xmath20-elliptic polynomial with degree @xmath49 and @xmath33 .",
    "of course the former is an analog to @xmath50 and the latter is that to @xmath51 appearing above .",

    ", we actually observe some arithmetic properties of @xmath59 .",
    "there appears an algebraic difficulty when @xmath60 , so that we obtain the result only in the case when @xmath61 .",
    "it is mentioned again in section [ secmainb ] why we have to restrict @xmath11 .",
    "the desired results in theorem [ thmainb ] are derived from some elementary calculations and the gelfond  schneider theorem , which gives the affirmative answer for hilbert s seventh problem : `` does @xmath62 become transcendental when @xmath63 and @xmath64 are algebraic over @xmath3 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 ? ''",
    "our calculations are out of analytic estimates unlike the former studies @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in our proof of theorem [ thmainb ] , we can obtain certain bounds for @xmath67 and @xmath68 concerned with our arguments .",
    "those bounds are cruder , compared with sharper results in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but they are sufficient for our present purpose . it seems to be more difficult to improve the bounds since no effective formula expressing the value of @xmath69 is known unlike the case when @xmath28 .",

    "let @xmath15 consists of its real part @xmath101 , its imaginary part @xmath102 and the imaginary unit @xmath103 .",
    "we will introduce three functions which perform the leading roles in this article . before giving the definitions of them , we recall a significant property of polynomials , say , being `` @xmath20-elliptic . ''",

    "this theorem combined with theorem [ thmainb ] gives our goal theorem [ thgoal ] , so that it remains just to prove theorem [ thmaina ] and theorem [ thmainb ] .",
    "we will prove theorem [ thmaina ] in this section and theorem [ thmainb ] in the next section . in order to prove the former , we need the following lemma from essouabri s article @xcite .    [ lemell ]",

    "first of all , we note that the desired estimate can be easily obtained by the above evaluations of @xmath134 and @xmath136 in the previous articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite when @xmath28 , for example , @xmath151 for any sufficiently large @xmath33 .",

    "this implies that @xmath158 and we can conclude by that , for example , @xmath159 as desired .",
