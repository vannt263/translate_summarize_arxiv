    "in a recent paper we discussed the application of the variational method to a gaussian well.@xcite we showed that harmonic variational functions yield reasonably accurate results for all well depths despite the fact that the shallow - well expansion for the ground - state variational energy does not agree with the exact expansion beyond the leading term .",
    "students at introductory courses on quantum mechanics are commonly encouraged to solve the schrdinger equation for a particle in a one - dimensional square box with finite walls .",
    "they thus learn that the exact solution decays exponentially as @xmath0 .",
    "after such an experience they would find it unreasonable the choice of harmonic variational functions that do not exhibit the behavior at infinity expected for the exact solutions to the schrdinger equation for the gaussian well .",
    "for this reason we think that it is interesting to show an alternative variational calculation based on trial functions with the expected exponential behavior at infinity .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : variational ] we develop the variational method for a general single - well potential - energy function . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaussian_well ] we discuss the application of the harmonic and exponential trial functions to the gaussian well , compare the approximate and exact energies for the ground and first - excited state as well as their shallow - well expansions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : deep_well ] we compare the variational and exact deep - well expansions that we did not consider in our previous paper.@xcite finally , in sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the main results and draw conclusions .",
    "we are interested in the solutions to the schrdinger equation @xmath1 for the dimensionless hamiltonian operator @xmath2 in our previous paper we showed how to convert the schrdinger equation into a dimensionless eigenvalue equation and we do not repeat it here.@xcite for concreteness we choose the dimensionless potential - energy function to be of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and the function @xmath5 exhibits a maximum at @xmath6 and tends to zero when @xmath7 . since we restrict ourselves to single wells",
    "we also assume that @xmath8 if @xmath9 and @xmath10 if @xmath11 although we do not make use of this condition explicitly .",
    "we will discuss a particular example later on .",
    "the reader will find some references about quantum - mechanical wells in our earlier paper.@xcite    it is our purpose to obtain simple solutions for some states of the quantum well by means of the variational method . to this end",
    "we choose a variational function @xmath12 that depends on a variational parameter @xmath13 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath14 then the variational principle gives us an upper bound to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath15 and we realize that the optimum value of @xmath13 is given by the minimum of @xmath16 . if we write @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 then @xmath20 becomes @xmath21 commonly , solving this equation for @xmath13 may not be possible or may lead to cumbersome expressions . in that case",
    "we can resort to a simple parametric expression for the approximate energy in the form @xmath22    if @xmath23 then the states have definite parity @xmath24 and the variational principle applies to @xmath25 or @xmath26 if the variational function is even or odd , respectively .",
    "therefore , the variational equations ( [ eq : w(a),v0(a ) ] ) apply to both the ground and first excited states .",
    "in order to illustrate the performance of the variational method on quantum - mechanical wells we choose a particularly simple example that allows us to calculate the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 analytically . as in our earlier paper",
    "we select the gaussian well given by @xmath29 and begin present discussion with the calculation based on harmonic - oscillator - like variational functions.@xcite the simplest variational function for the ground state is @xmath30 and we easily obtain    @xmath31    we showed that @xmath32 as @xmath33 according to@xcite @xmath34 while the exact expansion is@xcite @xmath35 note that the cubic term is missing in the approximate expansion ( [ eq : w0h_weak ] ) .    we have also shown that @xmath36 is a suitable variational function for the first excited state , and in this case we have    @xmath37    it is well known that @xmath38 as @xmath39 approaches a critical well strength @xmath40 from above@xcite .",
    "we can estimate the critical strength by means of equations ( [ eq : w1h(a ) ] ) in a quite simple way .",
    "we first obtain a positive root of @xmath41 and then @xmath42 ; the result is @xmath43 and @xmath44 . since the variational energy is an upper bound to the exact one for all @xmath39 then it is not surprising that @xmath45 .",
    "the error for the critical strength obtained with this variational function is rather large : @xmath46 .",
    "we may try to improve those results by means of more convenient trial functions . since @xmath47",
    "we know that the eigenfunctions behave as @xmath48 for sufficiently large @xmath49 , where @xmath50 . in order to avoid the function @xmath49 in our calculations we work on the half positive line @xmath11 and",
    "take into account the boundary conditions at origin : @xmath51 , @xmath52 for the even states and @xmath53 , @xmath54 for the odd ones .",

    "first expand @xmath59 into an @xmath13-series :    @xmath60    that we invert to obtain the @xmath39-series for @xmath13    @xmath61    then , we expand @xmath58 in a taylor series about @xmath62    @xmath63    and substitute the series ( [ eq : a(v0)_series_exp ] ) to obtain the shallow - well expansion    @xmath64    the calculation is straightforward but extremely tedious if carried out by hand . for this reason it is a good exercise for showing the students the advantage and power of computer algebra .",
    "such software even offer a command for obtaining the inverted series ( [ eq : a(v0)_series_exp ] ) in one step .",

    "we conclude that @xmath68 for sufficiently small @xmath39 . in other words ,",
    "the trial function with the correct asymptotic behavior at infinity yields a more accurate variational energy for sufficiently shallow wells .    fig  [ fig : e0 ] shows @xmath69 , @xmath58 and @xmath25 ( obtained by numerical integration@xcite ) for some values of @xmath39 .",
    "the variational curves are almost indistinguishable in the scale of the figure .",
    "the numerical results show that they cross at @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 if @xmath73 and @xmath74 if @xmath75 . in other words : @xmath58 is more accurate for shallow wells as argued above and @xmath69 is more accurate for deep ones .",

    "[ fig : e1 ] shows @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath26 ( obtained by numerical integration@xcite ) for a range of @xmath39 values . in this case",
    "the variational curves are not so close each other and the crossing takes place at @xmath83 . we realize that the exponential function is preferable for the description of shallow wells as suggested by the errors in the variational critical well strengths . on the other hand , the harmonic function leads to more accurate results for deep wells",
    "the deep - well expansion for a general well can be easily derived by means of perturbation theory.@xcite it follows from those results that the first terms of the expansion for the gaussian well are @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the harmonic - oscillator quantum number .    in order to obtain the deep - well expansion for @xmath69 first note that the expression for @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq : w0h(a ) ] ) shows that @xmath86 as @xmath87 and that the leading term is @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we substitute @xmath89 into the expression for @xmath39 and set the unknown coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 in order to remove the leading powers of @xmath39 . in this way",

    "proceeding exactly in the same way with equation ( [ eq : w1h(a ) ] ) we obtain    @xmath96    and @xmath97 that agrees with ( [ eq : exact_deep_exp ] ) when @xmath98 .",
    "it is clear that the harmonic variational functions are suitable for the description of deep wells which is in agreement with the results in figures [ fig : e0 ] and [ fig : e1 ] .",
    "we have calculated the first two energy levels of the gaussian well by means of two types of variational functions . the harmonic trial functions lead to simpler expressions and their results are reasonable for all values of the well depth .",
    "the approximate energies exhibit a slightly accurate expansion for shallow wells and a more satisfactory one for deep wells . in the latter case",
    "they provide the first three dominant terms of perturbation theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "the expressions for the energy obtained from exponential functions are rather complicated and their results are less accurate for deep wells .",
    "however , they are useful if one is interested in the behavior of the system near threshold ( shallow wells ) .",
    "present results suggest that the appropriate behavior of the wavefunction at infinity does not always guarantee the greatest accuracy . in the case of a deep well",
    "the wavefunction is strongly localized and compressed about @xmath6 and the description of the neighborhood of the origin is more important than what happens at larger @xmath49 .",
    "a most intriguing result is that both variational approaches fail to yield the cubic term in the shallow - well expansion .",
    "we have carried out a similar calculation for the particle in the square box with finite walls and found that the expansion of the variational energy given by the trial function ( [ eq : varphi_0e ] ) does not exhibit the cubic term that appears in the exact series . in this case",
    "one can obtain the exact @xmath39-series for @xmath25 from the transcendental equation that determines the energy levels of that model .",
    "we do not have a satisfactory explanation for this failure of the variational method ."
