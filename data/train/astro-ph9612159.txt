    "maoz & rix ( 1993 ) used the snapshot survey results to demonstrate that early - type galaxies must have , on average , dark massive halos similar to those of spiral galaxies , and that the geometry of the universe is not dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath3 , setting an upper limit of @xmath9 .",
    "ground - based surveys of 360 additional quasars and their analysis ( see kochanek 1996 , and references therein ) have confirmed these results . while the statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars with multiple images in the angular range expected due to galaxy lensing",

    "( 1995 ) , kochanek ( 1995 ) , and flores & primack ( 1996 ) have all compared large - scale structure formation models to the observed statistics of large - separation lensed quasars .",
    "however , the statistics utilized were the known lensed quasars in published catalogs , which are basically literature compilations .",
    "as emphasized by kochanek ( 1995 ) , most quasars found in quasar surveys are near the faint detection limits of the surveys .",
    "the surveys will therefore generally not find faint lensed images of a given quasar , unless the two images are close in brightness .",
    "kochanek ( 1995 ) estimates that that the completeness level of the catalogs , in terms of large - separation lenses , is only 20% .",
    "furthermore , gould , bahcall , & maoz ( 1993 ) have shown that quasar surveys using spectroscopic selection methods are biased against quasars having stars nearby in projection .",
    "presumably , the same bias operates against neighboring lensed images , and would further select against inclusion of lensed quasars in the catalogs .",
    "there is therefore a possibility that large - separation lensing is more common than assumed , and that many such lensed quasars have been missed .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we present the results of the first extensive survey for large - separation lensed quasars among known quasars .",
    "we use multi - color photometry and spectroscopy to test whether each of the point sources in the entire @xmath12 field of view of the _ hst _ planetary camera ( pc ) exposures of 76 quasars in the original snapshot survey could be lensed images of the quasars . in the second part of the paper ,",

    "( 1995 ) for small - separation lensing by galaxies , with galaxy clusters playing the previous role of galaxies .",
    "in addition to including effects such as magnification bias and observational detection limits , our calculation uses a realistic cluster mass profile that is motivated by n - body simulations ( navarro , frenk , & white 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) and is consistent with the observations of `` radial arcs '' in clusters ( bartelmann 1996 ) .",
    "the choice of mass profile is important , since lensing calculations are sensitive to the presence of a core vs. a singular profile ( e.g. flores & primack 1996 ) .",
    "in the _ hst _ snapshot survey for lensed quasars , 498 quasars were imaged with the planetary camera .",
    "the sample consisted of most of the quasars in the vron - cetty & vron ( 1989 ) catalog with redshift @xmath8 , absolute magnitude @xmath13 ( @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , and galactic latitude @xmath17 .",
    "( see maoz et al . 1993b , for further details .",

    "the reason for this is unclear .",
    "the same selection effect may operate on lensed images of the quasar , such that spectroscopically selected quasars are less likely to be lensed at separations above several arcseconds .",
    "gould et al .",
    "( 1993 ) defined an `` unbiased '' sample of 166 quasar fields in which the quasar was discovered by non - spectroscopic means ( color - excess , radio , x - rays ) .",
    "for the present study , we have chosen from among the unbiased sample the 88 quasars in the anti - center galactic hemisphere ( i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is galactic longitude ) . by looking only at quasars in the anti - center hemisphere",
    ", we greatly reduce the number of stars that have to be checked to see if they are lensed images .",
    "there are no point sources in the fields of 29 of the anti - center quasars , so these automatically pass the test for not being lensed ( within the detection limits and the field of view probed by a given exposure ) . in nine additional quasar fields ,",
    "the only other sources present are significantly brighter than the quasar .",
    "if they were lensed images of the quasars , they would have been identified as such by the original surveys .",
    "( this is not necessarily true of x - ray surveys , which may have poor angular resolution .",

    "this leaves us with an observed sample of 76 quasars .",
    "the 76 quasars and their parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 observations were made on 1993 march 49 at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) and on 1993 september 510 at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "both runs used tektronix @xmath27-pixel ccds at the cassegrain focus of 0.9 m telescopes .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standards were observed throughout the nights .",
    "conditions were photometric , with a scatter of less than 0.03 mag around the fits to the landolt magnitudes .",
    "the ground - based @xmath25 and @xmath26 magnitudes of each point source appearing in the _ hst _ exposures were measured using the daophot point - source - function ( psf ) fitting routine ( stetson 1987 ) within iraf .",
    "errors were calculated by combining in quadrature the error in the photometric solution , as determined from its covariance matrix , the scatter around the photometric error , and the daophot psf - fitting error .",

    "the first line for each field gives the results for the quasar in the field , and the subsequent lines for the stars .",
    "positions of the stars are given in gould et al .",
    "the @xmath28 uncertainty listed in table 2 does not include the absolute photometric calibration error , since this error cancels out in the _ difference _ between the @xmath28 color of a quasar and a star observed in the same ccd frame .    from a comparison of @xmath28 colors between each quasar and its neighboring objects , we can reject all stars in the fields of 26 quasars as candidate lensed images .",
    "the star near one quasar , 0024 + 22 , can be rejected as a lensed image based on the absence of a radio counterpart ( condon et al .",
    "1981 ) , as described in maoz et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "the remaining 14 stars around 11 quasars have a color difference between star and quasar of @xmath29 mag . since such color differences among lensed images",
    "are possible due to differential reddening in the different light paths , these cases were kept for further testing .",
    "we measured @xmath30 and @xmath25 magnitudes for these remaining candidates on 1994 november 11 and 12 at the wise observatory 1 m telescope with a tektronix @xmath31 back - illuminated ccd .",
    "the reduction and calibration was as for the kpno and ctio observations described above .",
    "the @xmath32 colors are given in table 2 .",
    "if a @xmath28 color difference between lensed images is due to differential reddening , then the expected @xmath32 color difference among the images will be @xmath33 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "based on @xmath34 significantly greater ( after accounting for all the measurement errors ) than expected from @xmath35 and reddening , we excluded eight of these stars , leaving six point sources in the fields of six quasars , each having both @xmath28 and @xmath32 colors similar to the quasar in their field .",
    "spectra were obtained for these 6 sources at the multiple - mirror telescope ( mmt ) on 1995 , november 2527 , using a 1200 l / mm grating , covering 4500   to 6000   at 2   resolution . the spectra show that all six are foreground stars .",
    "they are marked as such in the right - hand column in table 2 .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that none of the point sources detected in the pc field of view of 76 unbiased snapshot survey quasars in the anti - center hemisphere are lensed quasar images .",
    "we have carried out a calculation of the expected number and distribution in angular separation of lensed quasars due to the effects of intervening galaxy clusters .",
    "our calculation follows closely that of maoz & rix ( 1993 ) .",
    "briefly , for a given observed quasar and a particular lens ( i.e. , a cylindrically - symmetric cluster of a particular redshift and mass ) we find the `` critical radius '' inside which lensing into multiple images occurs . for every impact parameter inside this radius",
    ", we calculate the three image positions and their magnifications .",
    "we weight the image distribution for the particular lens according to the magnification bias , the cross section for lensing at that redshift , the number density of clusters of that mass , and the volume of space included in a redshift interval .",
    "we then integrate numerically the image distributions over grids in cluster mass and redshift ( from @xmath36 to @xmath37 of the quasar ) , to obtain the probability that a given quasar in the sample is lensed , as a function of image separation .",
    "we weight this distribution for each quasar according to the detection efficiency as a function of image separation .",
    "these probability distributions are calculated for every quasar in the sample and added , to give the expected number , and distribution in image separation , of lensed quasars in the survey .",
    "we provide more details below , with emphasis on places where the calculation differs from maoz & rix ( 1993 ) .      to model the mass profile of galaxy clusters , we have used the radial mass density function @xmath38 where the radial coordinate , @xmath39 , is in units of the scale radius @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "navarro et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) have found that this mass profile describes well the dark - matter halos produced in cosmological n - body simulations for a variety of initial density fluctuation spectra .",
    "note that at its center , the profile is singular , with @xmath42 .",
    "it is thus intermediate between the two types of mass profiles that have been considered in previous works on cluster lensing statitics , the singular isothermal sphere models , where @xmath43 , and models with a core , where @xmath44 flattens to a constant at the cluster center .",
    "it is similar at small radii to the hernquist profile , @xmath45 , considered by flores & primack ( 1996 ) , but falls off more gently at large radii .",
    "bartelmann ( 1996 ) has shown that the mass profile of equation 1 can produce radially distorted images of background sources , so - called `` radial arcs '' , whose existence were previously thought to indicate cores in galaxy clusters .",
    "flores & primack ( 1996 ) have shown that , if clusters have large cores , the number of large - angle splittings is greatly reduced , even in cosmological models with excessive large - scale structure ( e.g. standard cold dark matter [ cdm ] ) .",
    "they have argued that large - separation lensing is therefore not a sensitive probe of large - scale structure .",
    "bartelmann s demonstration that clusters with a central density singularity can produce radial arcs renews that possibility that such clusters are efficient splitters of background quasars , and hence useful probes of large - scale structure and its evolution . in view of the results of navarro",
    "et al . and bartelmann",
    ", we consider equation 1 to be the one of the more realistic cluster mass profiles .    for our lensing calculations ,",
    "we have used the expressions given by bartelmann ( 1996 ) for the mass @xmath46 enclosed within a cylinder of radius @xmath39 .",
    "the bending angle of a light ray passing the cluster at impact parameter @xmath39 , and hence the image positions and magnifications , are determined by @xmath47 and its derivative ( see , e.g. , maoz & rix 1993 ) .",
    "the mathematical details for the present case are provided in an appendix .    from figure 9 of navarro",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) we estimate that that the scale length @xmath40 depends on the cluster mass @xmath48 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 .",
    "the index @xmath51 varies among cosmological models between @xmath52 ( cdm ) to @xmath53 ( for a model with initial density fluctuation power spectrum of power - law form with index @xmath54 ) .",
    "when @xmath51 is large , low - mass clusters have dense central regions and can become efficient lenses .      as in maoz & rix ( 1993 ) , we have incorporated the detection limits for multiple images for each quasar into the calculation . in maoz & rix ( 1993 ) ,",
    "the detection limits included the angular resolution limit for detection of images with a given brightness ratio , and the flux limit of the exposure . in the present work",
    ", we have also included the incompleteness of the survey at large angular separations due to the positioning of the quasar on the pc field of view . for technical reasons ,",
    "the quasar was generally not in the center of the pc field of view .",
    "the angular range from @xmath55 was therefore covered with a varying degree of completeness for each angle and each quasar . for every quasar ,",
    "the lensing probability distribution at angle @xmath56 was scaled by a factor equal to the fraction of a circle , of radius @xmath57 with center at the quasar position , that is within the pc field of view .",
    "the position of each quasar on the pc is given in table 1 .",
    "see maoz et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for more details on the pc observations .",
    "the effect of this angular selection function on the completeness of the survey is examined in  4 .",
    "the magnification bias is the over - representation of lensed quasars in a flux - limited quasar sample due to the facts that lensing increases the apparent brightness of a quasar and that there are more faint quasars than bright ones .",
    "the magnification bias is calculated as in maoz & rix ( 1993 ) , with the probability @xmath58 for amplification by a factor @xmath59 calculated for the cluster lenses under consideration here .",
    "we have updated the slopes of the quasar luminosity function to @xmath60 , @xmath61 , the absolute magnitude of the break in the local luminosity function to @xmath62 and the luminosity evolution power - law index to @xmath63 , according to the results of boyle et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "to represent the number density of clusters of a given mass , we have used the observational results of bahcall & cen ( 1993 ) , rather than the theoretical large - scale structure predictions used by previous studies of large - separation lensing .",
    "bahcall & cen find that , for groups and clusters of galaxies with mass @xmath48 between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the mass function can be represented analytically by @xmath66 mpc@xmath67 .",
    "here @xmath68,and @xmath48 is the mass within a @xmath69 mpc radius sphere around the cluster center .",
    "bahcall & cen also show that the extrapolation of this function to @xmath70 has a value similar to the space density of `` noncluster '' @xmath71 _ galaxies _ , and note that this continuity is expected from general theoretical expectations ( e.g. press & schechter 1974 ) . since the observed galaxy luminosity function actually has an exponential cutoff at @xmath72 , the implication would be that dark halos form at all masses , but when the mass is above @xmath70 , a group or a cluster will form in it , rather than a galaxy . in practice , it is unknown whether or not dark halos in the @xmath73 range exist .",
    "since , as will turn out , halos in this mass range can be important for large separation lensing , we will allow for two possibilities : that the cluster mass function can be extrapolated down to @xmath70 , as in bahcall & cen , or that there is a lower cutoff to the mass of clusters at @xmath74 ( i.e. a gap in the halo mass function , contrary to press - schechter theory ) .",
    "we will further examine the consequences of such a gap in  4 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath75 with respect to @xmath48 gives @xmath76 , the local ( @xmath36 ) space density of clusters of mass @xmath48 to @xmath77 . as a first approximation , we have assumed that the number of clusters per co - moving volume element does not evolve between @xmath36 and the redshift of the quasar ( typically @xmath2 ) , i.e. the number density at @xmath37 is @xmath78 .",
    "flores & primack ( 1996 ) show that the no - evolution assumption is a reasonable approximation to the numerical cdm calculation of cen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and occurs because a cluster - sized perturbation is already virialized inside a radius of @xmath79 kpc by @xmath80 .",
    "it is the inner parts of the cluster which determine the lensing statistics . in non - cdm models",
    ", clusters may form more recently , and one would expect that at higher @xmath37 there are fewer clusters and/or the mass in clusters is less concentrated .",
    "however , we find that even with the simplistic assumption of no evolution , the expected number of large - separation lensed quasars in the survey is generally @xmath81 , and hence consistent with the observed null result .",
    "clearly , incorporation of recent cluster formation would further lower the prediction .",
    "more details on the results and their dependence on the input parameters are given below .",
    "we have calculated the number of lensed quasars we expect to detect in our sample as a function of image separation for a variety of combinations of the input parameters of clusters .",
    "figure 1 shows the expected distribution for a particular choice of parameters .",
    "also shown is the distribution that would result if the angular selection function resulting from the positioning of the quasar on the pc did not exist .",
    "we see that the angular selection function does not seriously impair our ability to detect lensed quasars , and has some effect only at the largest ( @xmath82 ) separations .",
    "the total number of expected lensed quasars above @xmath10 separation in this particular model is 0.032 ( 0.041 without the angular selection function ) , consistent with our null result .",
    "although the clusters produce lensed quasars with separations smaller than @xmath10 too , comparison to the observations in the @xmath83 range is complicated because lensing with such separations is produced by galaxy lenses as well . a case in point",
    "is the lensed quasar 0957 + 561 , with @xmath84 image separation .",
    "it was not observed with _ hst _ because it was previosly known to be lensed but , in principle , it is part of the snapshot sample ( see maoz et al .",
    "since it is radio - discovered and in the anti - center hemisphere , it would be included in the present sample as well .",
    "however , a cluster and a galaxy both play a significant role in lensing this quasar",
    ". it would therefore be unclear whether or not it counts as one detection when comparing to the predictions of lensing by clusters . by comparing models and observations only for separations @xmath85",
    ", we restrict ourselves to lensing by clusters alone .    a free parameter in our calculation is @xmath51 , the power - law index relating the scale radius @xmath40 to the total cluster mass ( eq .",
    "2 ) . navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) predict that @xmath51 varies between cosmological models in the range of 1/3 to 1 . among the input parameters ,",
    "the total number of lensed quasars is , by far , most sensitive to @xmath51 . a large @xmath51 gives low- and intermediate - mass clusters a large central density , turning them into efficient lenses .",
    "figure 2 shows the lensing distribution on a logarithmic scale for various values of @xmath51 .",
    "the models with @xmath86 produce @xmath87 lensed quasars in our sample .",
    "these models are therefore consistent with our observed null result , even if the other input parameters , such as the number density of clusters or the mass of an @xmath88 cluster have both been underestimated by an order of magnitude .",
    "on the other hand , models with @xmath53 produce about one expected lens for the `` standard '' input parameters ( the bahcall & cen 1993 mass function and an einstein - de sitter @xmath89 cosmology ) .",
    "models predicting 3 ( 4.5 ) or more lenses can be rejected at @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) confidence based on poisson statistics",
    ". factors of a few in the predicted number of lenses can result from mild changes in the parameters of the mass function ( which is empirically not well constrained ) or the cosmology ( e.g. , lowering @xmath92 , or introducing a cosmological constant @xmath3 will raise the prediction ) .",
    "some models with high @xmath51 and various combinations of the other parameters can therefore be rejected .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependence of the lensing distribution on @xmath88 , the exponential upper mass cutoff in the cluster mass function . for low @xmath51 ,",
    "the total number and the mean image separation of lensed quasars both increase with @xmath88 . at higher",
    "@xmath51 ( not shown ) , the total number of lensed quasars is insensitive to @xmath88 , and only the centroid of the distribution shifts slowly with @xmath88 .",
    "this occurs because , for large @xmath51 , the more massive clusters that are introduced by raising @xmath88 have large scale lengths , and so do not lens effectively .",
    "the parameter plane of @xmath51 and @xmath88 is shown in figure 4 , which gives the total number of predicted lensed quasars with @xmath85 separation for combinations of these parameters . @xmath89 and",
    "the bahcall & cen ( 1993 ) value of @xmath93 , the number density of @xmath88-mass clusters , are assumed .",
    "increasing @xmath93 would increase the number of lensed quasars by the same proportion .",
    "we see that , if @xmath51 is large , the number density of clusters can not be much above the bahcall & cen ( 1993 ) estimate , or some lensed quasars would have been found in the survey .",
    "a great advantage of gravitational lensing is that it probes mass , rather than light .",
    "the above result therefore also shows that , unless @xmath51 is small , there can not be a large population of `` failed clusters '' , i.e. dark halos not containing clusters of galaxies .",
    "the predicted number of lensed quasars approximately doubles when going from a flat @xmath89 to an open @xmath94 model .",
    "low - density open models with @xmath53 predict more than 3 lenses , so are inconsistent with the data .    because dense , low - mass clusters can be efficient lenses , introducing a lower mass cutoff at @xmath74 in the cluster mass function ( see  3.5 ) greatly reduces the lensing prediction .",
    "for example , in a @xmath95 model , the expected lensing distribution decreases by a factor of @xmath96 below @xmath97 , and by a factor of @xmath98 above @xmath97 , so the total expected number of lensed quasars decreases by about a factor of 15 . for @xmath99",
    "( i.e. , low - mass clusters are not so dense ) the distribution decreases by a factor of @xmath100 below @xmath97 , but is unchanged above @xmath97 .",
    "finally , high-@xmath51 models in a flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant can also be ruled out .",
    "this is shown in figure 5 , displaying the @xmath101 plane .",
    "for example , a model with @xmath102 and @xmath103 produces over 5 lensed quasars in our sample .",
    "this limit on @xmath3 is independent of the limits that have been derived based on small - separation quasar lensing by galaxies ( fukugita & turner 1990 ; maoz & rix 1993 ; kochanek 1996 ) .",
    "fukugita & peebles ( 1993 ) and malhotra , rhoads , & turner ( 1997 ) have suggested that small - separation lensing statistics can be reconciled with a @xmath3-dominated universe by invoking dust in the lensing galaxies .",
    "the excess number of lensed quasars would then be hidden by extinction .",
    "this argument is not applicable to lensing by clusters .",
    "maoz ( 1995 ) has shown that rich clusters do not significantly redden quasars that are behind them .",
    "a similar demonstration has been made for poorer clusters by williams & hawkins ( 1996 ) .",
    "conversely , if the dependence of cluster scale length on cluster mass is weak ( i.e. if @xmath51 is small ) , or if there is a significant decrease in the number of clusters between now and @xmath104 , or if there is a gap in the halo mass function between masses of @xmath105 , a @xmath3-dominated universe is allowed by the present large - separation lensing statistics .    due to the smallness of this first large - separation sample",
    ", we have limited the range of models we have examined , and avoided complications such as evolution in cluster number and structure .",
    "upcoming surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey , will detect and test orders of magnitude more quasars for lensing by galaxies and by clusters .",
    "if @xmath51 is small , we predict that even these surveys will find no examples of large - separation lensed quasars .",
    "if , on the other hand , clusters have dense centers , many such lenses will be found .",
    "their detailed statistics can then serve as a valuable probe of the structure , number , and evolution of galaxy clusters , and of the geometry of the universe .",
    "we thank j. wambsganss for suggesting this project .",

    "<S> we extend the results of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) snapshot survey for lensed quasars to the @xmath1 range for a sub - sample of 76 quasars that is free of known selection effects . using a combination of multicolor photometry and spectroscopy , </S>",
    "<S> we show that none of the point sources in the entire field of view of the _ hst _ observations of these quasars are lensed images . </S>",
    "<S> large - separation quasar lensing is therefore not common . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a detailed calculation of the expected statistics of large - separation lensing for this quasar sample , incorporating realistic input for the mass profiles and mass function of galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the observational null results are consistent with the expected effect of galaxy clusters , even if these have existed in their present form and number since @xmath2 ( and certainly if they were formed more recently ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rarity of large - separation lensed quasars can rule out some extreme scenarios , e.g. that the mass - function of clusters has been severely underestimated , or that large mass concentrations that are not associated with galaxies ( i.e. `` failed '' clusters ) are common . </S>",
    "<S> the rareness of cluster lensing also sets limits on the cosmological constant @xmath3 that are independent of limits derived from galaxy lensing . </S>",
    "<S> the lensing frequency depends strongly on the central density of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the lensing statistics of larger quasar samples ( e.g. the sloan digital sky survey ) can probe the structure , number , and evolution of clusters , as well as the geometry of space .    </S>",
