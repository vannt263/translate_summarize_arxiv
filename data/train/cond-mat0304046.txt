    "an important tool to study an interacting particle system moving over a ( random ) pinning potential , e.g. a sliding solid , charge density wave or vortex array , is to probe the force - velocity characteristics with a superimposed rf - drive . for a coherently ( elastically ) moving array ,",
    "the rf - drive may interfere with lattice modes at an integer @xmath3 times the washboard frequency @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the periodicity of the array and @xmath6 its velocity , when the frequency @xmath1 of the rf - drive equals an integer fraction @xmath7 of @xmath8 @xcite . in the particular case of a vortex array ( va )",

    "@xcite predicts a particular form for the dc - current range @xmath12 over which the ml effect occurs .",
    "to first approximation , the current range @xmath13 of the main ml step ( @xmath14 ) is : @xmath15 ^ 2 , \\label{stepwidthformula}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the first order bessel function , @xmath17 the flux flow resistance , @xmath18 the fundamental ml voltage and @xmath19 the dc - critical current in absence of rf - drive .",
    "so far , the only report of ml of a va in a disordered superconducting film is ref .",
    "@xcite , where al films were used and the rf - amplitude dependence was not addressed . in this report we show that a - nbge films with weak random pinnning @xcite also exhibit the ml effect and we examine its dependence on @xmath20 .",
    "a @xmath21 nm thick amorphous ( a-)nbge strip ( @xmath22 k and normal state resistivity @xmath23 @xmath24 m ) , with current leads covered by a strong pinning nbn film ( @xmath25 k ) to reduce sample impedance , was prepared by rf sputtering and standard lithography . in the resulting four - probe configuration both the strip width and",
    "the distance between voltage contacts was @xmath26 @xmath27 m . in the transport measurement , the rf - current ( amplitude ranging from @xmath28 ma ) was applied through a matched circuit .",
    "all data were taken with the sample immersed in superfluid @xmath29he at a temperature @xmath30 k and the magnetic field @xmath2 perpendicular to the film .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] we plot @xmath11 versus the dc - voltage measured with a superimposed rf - current of @xmath31 mhz and an amplitude @xmath32 @xmath27a at magnetic fields @xmath2 ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 t. in the whole field range , the curves show a clear ml peak in @xmath11 which can be identified as the fundamental @xmath14 . additionally , for some fields , ( weaker ) subharmonic peaks can be observed . the ml voltage @xmath18 of the main peak scales with magnetic field as @xmath35 , in agreement with the relation @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "in addition we checked that the ml voltage at fixed field scales linearly with the frequency of the applied rf - current . the observed",
    "ml implies that the moving va predominantly experiences elastic deformations , validating the previous use of the collective pinning theory in this material @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the rf - amplitude dependence of the ml . due to rounding of the steps in the @xmath10 curves the ml current width @xmath12",
    "is best defined as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "the data in the main panel show the result of such analysis at @xmath38 t. the width @xmath12 clearly exhibits oscillatory behavior as function of @xmath20 .",
    "we also plot the dependence according to eq .",
    "( [ stepwidthformula ] ) ( drawn line ) where both @xmath17 and @xmath18 were extracted from the experiment , the only fit parameter being @xmath19 .",
    "the experimental data follow the theoretical prediction remarkably well . the fitted value @xmath39 @xmath27a is smaller than the critical current @xmath40 @xmath27a determined by linearly extrapolating the bare @xmath10 curve ( at @xmath41 ) to @xmath42 .",
    "this difference may arise from the approximation made in eq .",

    ". comparing our result to the numerical work of kolton et al .",
    "@xcite , we find no evidence for their suggestion that @xmath43 , valid for an rf - dc driven josephson junction at large voltage ( a single particle moving rapidly in a periodic potential ) .",
    "this discrepancy with their results , including the lack of step broadening , might originate from the neglect of long wavelength fluctuations in a finite size simulation .",
    "finally we mention that preliminary data taken at a larger frequency @xmath44 mhz exhibit ml up to a field @xmath45 at which the critical current has completely vanished and the iv curves have become fully linear with a slope @xmath46 .",
    "the field @xmath47 may be identified as the equilibrium melting field of the 2d vortex lattice , in line with ref .",
    "for fields slightly below @xmath47 , ml sensitively depends on the frequency .",
    "since the va softens considerably just below melting , the effect of pinning disorder is stronger in this regime .",
    "based on the dynamic ordering theory in @xcite and our measurements in disordered mesoscopic channels @xcite , one then indeed expects the appearance of a coherent state to depend strongly on the vortex velocity ."
