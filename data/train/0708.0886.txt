    "since its launch in august 2003 , the _ spitzer _ space telescope has opened new ir observing windows to the universe and probed to unprecedented depths . the first scientific observation undertaken with the _ spitzer _ after its in - orbit - checkout period was the _ spitzer _ first look survey .",
    "the survey provided the first look of the mid - infrared ( mir ) sky with deeper sensitivities than previous systematic large surveys , allowing future users to gauge _ spitzer _ sensitivities .",
    "for the extragalactic component of the first look survey ( fls ) , the @xmath74.3 deg@xmath2 field centered at ra=17@xmath1318@xmath1400@xmath15 , dec=+59@xmath1630@xmath1700@xmath6 was observed with the infrared array camera ( irac , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0@xmath18 m ; fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips , 24 , 70 , 160@xmath18 m ; rieke et al .",
    "the main survey field has flux limits of 20 , 25 , 100 , and 100@xmath18jy at wavelengths of irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath18 m respectively .",
    "the deeper verification field , covering the central 900 arcmin@xmath2 field , has sensitivities of 10 , 10 , 30 , and 30@xmath18jy at irac wavelengths .",
    "( lacy et al . 2005 ) also , the fls verification strip field has 3@xmath5 flux limits of 90@xmath18jy at mips 24@xmath18 m ( yan et al .",
    "2004a ) , and 9 , and 60 mjy at 70 , 160@xmath18 m ( frayer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the reduced images and source catalogs have been released ( lacy et al .",
    "2005 ; frayer et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in order to support the fls ,",
    "various ground - based ancillary datasets have also been obtained . a deep @xmath19-band survey to @xmath20(5@xmath5)=25.5 mag ( kpno 4 m , fadda et al .",
    "2004 ) and a radio survey at 1.4ghz to 90@xmath18jy ( vla , condon et al .",
    "2003 ) have been performed to identify sources at different wavelengths .",
    "imaging surveys with the palomar large format camera ( lfc ) , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 band data covering 14 deg@xmath2 have also been taken since 2001 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey also covers the fls field .",
    "moreover , spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for many sources using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ) at the keck observatory as well as hydra instrument on the wisconsin indiana yale noao ( wiyn ) observatory . utilizing all the _ spitzer _ and the ground - based ancillary datasets , many science results have come out already from the fls .",
    "the fls studies range from the infrared source counts to the properties of obscured galaxies such as submm galaxies , red active galactic nuclei(agns ) , and extremely red objects ( e.g. yan et al .",

    ", we have obtained new ground - based ancillary datasets , deep @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band imaging data that will be presented in this paper .",
    "the exploration of the cosmic star formation history at @xmath25 is one of the key scientific issues that the fls is designed to address . while studying the infrared emission is an extremely valuable way to understand the obscured star formation history of the universe , a complete census of the cosmic star formation history requires the measurement of unobscured star formation as well .",
    "such a measurement can be done effectively using the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum , which represents either instantaneous star formation activity of massive stars ( far uv ; fuv ) , or traces the star formation from intermediate age stars ( near uv ; nuv ) ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the fuv and nuv emission of galaxies at @xmath26 redshifts to the @xmath27-band ; therefore , the addition of the @xmath27-band enables us to describe the star formation history at @xmath26 to the full extent .",
    "also , using the deep @xmath27-band and @xmath1-band data , it is possible to select @xmath27-band dropout galaxies  star forming galaxies at @xmath28 . especially of interest are bright , massive lyman break galaxies which are rare , but important to constrain galaxy evolution models since they can tell us how massive galaxies are assembled in the early universe .",
    "the wide area coverage of the fls allows us to select such rare , bright lbgs .",
    "however , for the selection of lbgs , it is necessary to obtain @xmath27-band data and @xmath1-band data that matches the depth of the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "in addition , the @xmath27-band and @xmath1-band datasets can be used to test extinction correction methods , such as the estimation of dust extinction based on the measurement of uv slope ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ; meurer et al . 1999 ; adelberger & steidel , 2000 ) .",
    "when used together with other ground - based ancillary data , our @xmath27- and @xmath1-band data will be very helpful for improving the accuracy of photometric redshifts .    with these scientific applications in mind ,",
    "we present the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band optical observations made with the megacam at canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the dataset is composed of i ) deep @xmath0- , @xmath1-band data for the central 1 deg@xmath2 of the fls , and ii ) @xmath0-band data for the whole fls . in  2 ,",
    "we describe how our observations were made . the reduction and calibration procedures are in  3 .",
    "production of source catalogs is described in  4 .",

    "megacam consists of 36 2048@xmath304612 pixel ccds , covering 0.96 deg@xmath300.94 deg field of view with a resolution of 0.187@xmath6 per pixel ( see the detailed description in boulade et al .",
    "the available broad - band filters are similar to sdss _ ugriz _ filters , but not exactly the same especially in the case of @xmath0-band .",
    "we used @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters for our observations .",
    "the filter characteristics are summarized in table [ tab : filter ] , and their response curves are compared to the sdss @xmath27- and @xmath1-band filters in figure [ fig : filter ] .",
    "note that these response curves include the quantum efficiency of the ccds .",
    "the response curves of the two @xmath1-bands are nearly identical in their shapes , but the @xmath0-band response curve shows a different overall shape compared to the sdss @xmath27-band , in such a sense that @xmath0 filter is redder than sdss @xmath27 .",
    "the difference leads to as much as a 0.6 mag difference between the cfht & sdss @xmath27-magnitudes .",
    "this will be investigated further in the photometry section (  5.2 ) .",
    "our images on the fls field were taken with the queued observation mode in two separate runs ( 03b and 04a semesters ) .",
    "the first observing run occurred in august 2329 ( @xmath0-band ) and september 1922 ( @xmath1-band ) , 2003 . during this 03b run , we observed the central 1 deg@xmath2 of the fls field , which covers the entire fls verification strip .",
    "images are taken with medium dither steps of about 30@xmath6 , at 12 ( @xmath0 ) or 20 ( @xmath1 ) different dither positions .",
    "the exposure time at each position was 1160 seconds for @xmath0-band , 680 seconds for @xmath1-band .",
    "therefore , the total integration time per pixel amounts to @xmath73.8 hours for both bands .",
    "the yellow - colored box in figure [ fig : area ] , shows the location of this deep @xmath0- and @xmath1-band data superimposed on the @xmath19-band images ( fadda et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in the second observing run during 04a period",
    ", we obtained @xmath0-band images covering the whole fls field ( @xmath75 deg@xmath2 ) at a shallower depth .",
    "note that we did not take @xmath1-band data because the entire fls is covered to a shallower depth by the existing @xmath1-band data taken with the palomar 5 m telescope .",
    "the cfht observation was at first designed to take 10 dithered images at 7 different locations of the fls area , which are named as fls11fls32 ( table [ tab : obslog ] ) .",
    "the cyan - colored boxes marked with the dashed line in figure [ fig : area ] indicate fls11fls32 fields .",
    "the dates when the observations made span quite a wide range from april to july 2004 . some of the fields have all dithered images observed on a photometric condition ( fls21 , fls22 & fls31 ) , but other fields contain the images that are non - photometric . due to the bad weather , we lost some of the queued observing time and several observed images were not validated .",
    "each dithered image was taken with the exposure time of 680 seconds .",
    "although the original plan was to achieve 1.9 hours of total integration at each location , there is a field - to - field variation on the image depth between @xmath71 hour and @xmath72 hours .",

    "the delivered images are processed before mosaicking , using various iraf packages and tasks .",
    "the post - elixir image processing includes : ( 1 ) identification of saturated pixels and bleed trails ; ( 2 ) creation of new bad pixel masks ; ( 3 ) removal of satellite trails by inspecting each image frame ; ( 4 ) replacement of bad pixel values ; and ( 5 ) removal of cosmic rays .    as the first stage of the post - elixir image processing",
    ", we identified saturated pixels and bleed trails using the ` ccdproc ` task in iraf .",
    "the saturated pixels and bleed trails , which are the pixels showing nonlinear behavior , should be identified before stacking images because they can affect surrounding pixels during the projection of the image .",
    "those pixels with values above the saturation level , 64000 dn for @xmath0-band and 62000 dn for @xmath1-band , were identified as saturated pixels .",
    "neighboring pixels within a distance of 5 pixels along lines or columns of the selected saturation pixels are also identified as saturated .",
    "we found that the pixel saturation occurs typically at the central part of the stars brighter than @xmath3120 mag and @xmath3221 mag .",
    "bleed trails , which result from charge spillage from a ccd pixel above its capacity , tend to run down the columns .",
    "we identify bleed trails as more than 20 connected pixels that are 5000 counts above the mean value along the whole image ( i.e. , setting the ` ccdproc ` threshold parameter as `` mean+5000 '' ) . after the identification of saturated pixels and bleed trails ,",
    "this information is stored as a saturation mask .",
    "next , we used the iraf task ` imcombine ` to make new bad pixel masks by combining the saturation masks with the original cfht bad pixel masks .",
    "the resultant masks have pixel values of 0 for good pixels , greater than 0 for bad pixels . in the bad pixel masks",
    ", we also indicate the location of satellite trails . to include satellite trails in bad pixel masks , we identified satellite trails through the visual inspection by flagging their start / end ( x , y ) image coordinates and widths on each ccd chip .",
    "the flagged rectangular line is then marked as bad pixels in the bad pixel masks .    with the newly constructed bad pixel masks",
    ", we fixed the bad pixels using the iraf ` fixpix ` task .",
    "the value of the pixel marked in the bad pixel masks was replaced by the linear interpolation value from adjacent pixels .",
    "the next step is to identify the pixels affected by cosmic rays .",
    "we applied a robust algorithm based on a variation of laplacian edge detection with the program , ` la_cosmic ` ( van dokkum 2001 ) on each ccd frame .",
    "this algorithm identifies cosmic rays of arbitrary sizes and shapes , and our visual inspection of this procedure confirms effective removal of cosmic rays . after the cosmic ray cleaning , we improved the astrometric solution , which is described in the next section .",
    "the elixir data pipeline performs a rough astrometric calibration on each image , and the existing header wcs keywords are updated with the improved astrometric solution . as mentioned in elixir section (  3.1 ) , elixir calculates the astrometric solution for each ccd chip .",
    "an initial guess is determined for the image coordinate based on the initial header wcs keywords , and elixir uses hst guide star catalogs or usno database to calculate an astrometric solution .",
    "the solution derived by elixir is a first order fit that gives the rms scatter of 0@xmath95@xmath71@xmath6 .",
    "thus , the solution is not good enough for follow - up observations that require very accurate position information such as the multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "the accurate astrometry is also important when combining and mosaicking images , since misalignment of images can lead to a loss of signal in the combined image .    to improve the astrometric solutions , we adopted sdss sources as reference points , and derived the astrometric solution using ` msctpeak ` task in ` mscfinder ` , which is a subpackage of the iraf mosaic reduction package , ` mscred ` .",
    "the sdss sources brighter than @xmath3320 mag have an absolute astrometric accuracy of 0@xmath9045 rms with respect to usno catalogs ( zacharias et al . 2000 ) and 0@xmath9075 rms against tycho2 catalogs ( hog et al . 2000 ) with an additional 0@xmath902@xmath70@xmath903 systematic error in both cases ( pier et al .",
    "we also considered using usno and gsc catalogs ; unfortunately , many of the usno / gsc stars were saturated in our images , making it difficult to use them for astrometric calibration .",
    "there are other tasks such as ` msczero ` and ` msccmatch ` for deriving the astrometric solution , but we settled on using ` msctpeak ` .",
    "solutions from tasks such as ` msccmatch `  which works only in ` tan ` projection  are reflected in the value of ` cdi_j ` , ` crpixi ` header keywords . as a result ,",
    "the astrometric solutions from such tasks have limitations and they do not improve the astrometric accuracy significantly . on the other hand , `",
    "msctpeak ` creates a separate wcs database including a higher order fit solution from ` tnx ` sky projection geometry , and they are written as additional keywords such as ` wati_00j ` in the fits header using ` mscsetwcs ` task .",
    "the resultant astrometry of the image improved significantly over the original elixir astrometry solution .    ultimately , we used sdss sources with @xmath34 mag and @xmath35 mag to calculate the astrometric solutions for the @xmath27- and @xmath1-band images , respectively .",
    "the astrometric calibration objects were inspected by eye in order to exclude heavily saturated sources .",
    "the sources used for the astrometric calibration are not restricted to stars , since the sdss filters and cfht @xmath36 and @xmath1 filters are similar enough that the centroiding problem is not a great concern . including both stars and galaxies , we could get @xmath790 objects per chip to derive the astrometric solution .",
    "the solutions are calculated interactively for each chip , therefore there are 36 solutions for each dither image .",
    "functions used for the fitting are polynomials of order 3@xmath74 , and the fitting errors are typically below 0@xmath91 . how the astrometric solutions fair with other data are described in a separate section (  5.1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : astrom_imp ] demonstrates the improvement of astrometric solutions after executing the above procedure .",
    "we stacked the post - elixir processed , astrometrically calibrated images using _ swarp _ software by e. bertin at the terapix ( traitment elementaire , reduction et analyse des pixels de megacam ) . by running _",
    "swarp _ , we created the mosaic image and the corresponding weight image ( coverage map ) whose pixel value is proportional to the exposure time .",
    "the reduced images were resampled , background subtracted , flux scaled , and finally coadded to one image . the interpolation function we used in the resampling is ` lanczos3 ` , which uses a moderately large kernel .",
    "the pixel scale of the resampled image is kept to the original megacam pixel size of 0@xmath9185 .",
    "the astrometry transformation is handled by the _",
    "swarp _ program automatically , although the ` tnx ` wcs as derived in the previous section is not a fits standard .",
    "for the background subtraction , we used the background mesh size of 128 @xmath30 128 pixels , and applied 3 @xmath30 3 filter box . the background mesh size and the bin size",
    "are chosen to balance out the effect of bright stars ( in general smaller than 128 @xmath30 128 pixels ) and the effect of the overall background gradient .",
    "we tried many background combinations to obtain the background as flat as possible and settled on the above parameter values .",
    "the background - subtracted images are combined by taking the weighted average of each frame .",
    "the weight images are constructed by taking the bad pixel masks , and replacing the bad pixel values to be 0 , and the good pixel values to be 1 .",
    "the weight images constructed this way do not account for small variation in the pixel response over the ccd ( flat - field ) . finally , the images are coadded using the following equation : @xmath37 in this equation , @xmath38 is the value of a pixel in final coadded image , @xmath39 is the weight value for the pixel , and @xmath40 is the value of the pixel in each individual image .",
    "the factor @xmath41 represents the flux scale for each individual image .",
    "the images are calibrated to have the same photometric zeropoints after elixir pipeline , but due to the airmass differences , the flux scales of the images are slightly different . in order to take into account the difference in zeropoints",
    ", we put the flux scale of the image having the least extinction to be 1.0 .",
    "the flux scales of other images were calculated according to the equation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the coefficient for airmass term and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are airmass values of the reference image and the image in consideration , respectively .",
    "the coadded gain of the final stacked image varies with position and is proportional to the number of frames used for producing each coadded pixel value .",
    "we performed photometric calibration on the mosaic image of each field using the photometric solution provided by the elixir pipeline . during the production of mosaic images (  3.4 )",
    ", we rescaled each dither image so that each coadded image has the photometric zeropoint of the image with the least airmass value .",
    "then , these magnitudes were corrected for the galactic extinction estimating the amount of galactic extinction from the extinction map of schlegel et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "since the fls field lies at moderately high galactic latitude , the amount of galactic extinction is relatively small .",
    "they are 0.15 mag and 0.1 mag on average for the @xmath0 and @xmath1-band respectively . in the next step , we derived an additional zeropoint correction necessary to account for some of the data that were taken under non - photometric condition ( e.g. , thin cirrus ) .    to do so in @xmath0-band , we used fields whose mosaic image is made of photometric dither images only . the fields , fls21 , fls22 , and fls31 are such fields , and we used them as reference photometry fields to derive photometric zeropoint correction of other @xmath0-band fields .",
    "figure [ fig : zp_check ] shows the comparison of @xmath0-band magnitudes ( before correcting for the non - photometric data ) between different fields that overlap with each other . for the comparison of magnitudes , we used the total magnitude ( ` mag_auto ` ) from _ sextractor _ ( see section ",
    "4 ) . in figure [ fig :",
    "zp_check ] , we can see that @xmath0-band magnitudes of objects in fls21 , fls22 , and fls31 fields are slightly brighter than the same objects in the central field . also , objects in fields other than the reference photometry fields have @xmath0-band magnitudes similar or fainter than those of the central field .",
    "the @xmath0-magnitude offsets between the central field and fls21/22/31 are 0.03 magnitude and the rms in the offset values is of order of @xmath46 magnitude .",
    "this confirms that the u - band magnitudes of fls21/22/31 fields are the most reliable .",
    "the final @xmath0-band zeropoint of each field are calculated using this strategy , and we present the zeropoints in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the comparison of @xmath0-band magnitudes of overlapping objects after the photometric calibration are presented in figure [ fig : zp_checknew ] .",

    "the average seeing for the central 1 deg@xmath2 field is 0@xmath985 , while the seeing is @xmath71@xmath900 otherwise .",
    "the central field goes as deep as @xmath11 mag and @xmath12 mag at 5@xmath5 flux limit within 3@xmath6 aperture ( or @xmath750% completeness ) , while the shallower @xmath0-band data goes to 25.4 mag .",
    "our data are deep enough to detect optical counterparts of many irac and mips sources in the fls region .",
    "we recalibrated the astrometric solution , and the final absolute astrometric uncertainty is at the level of 0@xmath91 when compared with sdss point sources . with other surveys on fls ,",
    "the rms error is under 0@xmath93 , and it reflects merely the astrometric accuracy of the other datasets . the high astrometirc accuracy allows this data to be used efficiently for multislit or fiber spectroscopic observation of faint galaxies in the fls . using dual mode photometry , with @xmath1-band as the reference image , about 200,000 extragalactic objects are detected in our central 1 deg@xmath2 ( effective observed area reaches @xmath122 deg@xmath2 ) down to @xmath11 mag .",
    "there are @xmath750,000 sources per deg@xmath2 in the shallower @xmath0-band images down to @xmath123 mag .",
    "our galaxy number counts are consistent with other studies , and the number of spurious detections is less than 0.7% below our limiting magnitudes .",
    "our data could be used in many ways : for example , i ) selection of high redshift objects using broad - band dropout technique , ii ) improvement of photometric redshifts , and iii ) investigation on rest - frame uv properties of high redshift infrared sources .",
    "these studies are currently under way .",
    "the mosaic images and catalogs will be available through a public website in near future .",
