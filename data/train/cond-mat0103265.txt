    "the pair - breaker in the present paper is the impurities in the normal metal .",
    "though the origin of the pair - break are different in the two systems , the suppression of the pair potentials , therefore , the suppression of the josephson current is considered to be the common consequence when we determine the pair potential self - consistently .",

    "the self - consistent study has to be done to discuss the amplitude of the josephson current quantitatively .",

    "( [ zero ] ) is not sensitive to the profile of the pair potential because the @xmath4-wave symmetry is responsible for the disappearance of the averaged josephson current .",
    "the impurities may also modify the symmetry of the pair potentials .",
    "if the finite values of averaged josephson current is observed in experiments , such results might be an evidence for the change of the pairing symmetry due to the impurities .",
    "this is because the @xmath4-wave component of the pair potentials does not contribute to the averaged current for @xmath133 .    the sign change of the pair potential on the fermi surface , which is a characteristic feature of the anisotropic superconductors , leads to the disappearance of the josephson current .",
