    "in frequency or spectral domain analysis of time series , periodograms play a fundamental role . since its introduction by @xcite , periodograms have been used in almost all scientific fields . given a realization @xmath0 of a stochastic process @xmath1",
    ", the periodogram is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the imaginary unit .",
    "periodogram is the building block in spectral domain analysis and a distributional theory is clearly needed in the related statistical inference .",
    "if @xmath4 is a gaussian process , then the fourier transform @xmath5 is complex gaussian .",
    "@xcite proposed a test for hidden periodicities and obtained a distributional theory based on i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variables .",
    "if @xmath4 is not gaussian , the distribution of @xmath6 typically does not have a close form and one needs to resort to asymptotics .",
    "it is well known since @xcite [ see also @xcite ] that for any stationary sequence @xmath1 in @xmath7 ( namely @xmath8 ) there is a set @xmath9 of probability @xmath10 such that for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 converges .",
    "our problem is to investigate the speed of this convergence by providing a central limit theorem for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath14 .",
    "the above central limit problem was considered by many authors under various dependence conditions .",
    "we mention rosenblatt [ ( @xcite ) , theorem 5.3 , page  131 ] who considered mixing processes ; brockwell and davis [ ( @xcite ) , theorem  10.3.2 , page 347 ] , @xcite and @xcite discussed linear processes , and @xcite treated mixingales .",
    "other contributions can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite among others .    to establish an asymptotic theory for @xmath14",
    ", we shall provide the framework of stationary processes that can be introduced in several equivalent ways .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 is a stationary ergodic markov chain defined on a space @xmath16 with values in a measurable space .",
    "the marginal distribution is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "next let @xmath18 be the set of functions such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "denote by @xmath21 the @xmath22-field generated by @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 . for any integrable random variable @xmath26 we denote @xmath27 .",
    "we assume @xmath28 in other words we assume @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "notice that any stationary sequence @xmath31 can be viewed as a function of a markov process @xmath32 with the function @xmath33 .",
    "the stationary stochastic processes may be also introduced in the following alternative way .",
    "let @xmath34 be a bijective bi - measurable transformation preserving the probability .",
    "let @xmath35 be a @xmath22-algebra of @xmath36 satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "we then define the nondecreasing filtration @xmath38 by @xmath39 ( referred to as the stationary filtration ) .",
    "let @xmath40 be a random variable which is @xmath35-measurable .",
    "we also define the stationary sequence @xmath41 by @xmath42 . in this paper",
    "we shall use both frameworks .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the main results are presented in section [ sec : main ] and proved in section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "our proofs in section [ sec : proof ] provide an interesting blend of harmonic analysis , martingale approximation and theory of stationary processes .",
    "examples of regular processes and further extensions are given in section [ sec : ex ] .",
    "we shall assume that the following regularity condition holds : @xmath43 and also that the sequence is stationary and ergodic .",
    "the regularity condition is quite mild and it is satisfied for many popular processes used in practice .",
    "section  [ sec : ex ] provides examples of stationary ergodic processes for which ( [ regular ] ) holds .",
    "we shall present first a central limit theorem for almost all frequencies . in theorem [ sd1 ] , we let the parameter @xmath11 be in the space @xmath44 $ ] , endowed with borelian sigma algebra and lebesgue measure @xmath45 .",
    "we denote by `` @xmath46 '' the weak convergence , or convergence in distribution .",
    "[ sd1 ] let @xmath47 be a stationary ergodic process such that ( [ regular ] ) is satisfied . then for almost all @xmath48 , the following convergence holds : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is integrable over @xmath51 $ ] , and @xmath52\\rightarrow\\lbrack n_{1}(\\theta ) , n_{2}(\\theta)]\\qquad \\mbox{under } p,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are independent identically distributed normal random variables mean @xmath55 and variance @xmath56 .",
    "as implied by lemma [ key2 ] in section [ sec : proof ] , @xmath57 is actually the spectral density associated with the spectral distribution function induced by the covariances @xmath58 more specifically , by herglotz s theorem [ @xcite ] , there exists a nondecreasing function @xmath59 ( the spectral distribution function ) on @xmath60 $ ] such that , for all @xmath61 , @xmath62 hence , by lemma [ key2 ] , @xmath59 is absolutely continuous and the spectral density @xmath63 equals to @xmath64 almost surely . by ( [ eq : june6 ] ) or ( [ eq : may312 ] ) ,",
    "so a nice implication of our results is that , under the regularity condition , we obtain an interesting representation of the spectral densities ( see lemma [ key2 ] for details ) .    following the proof of theorem [ sd1 ] , by the cramr  wold device , for @xmath66 we have that , for almost all pairs @xmath67 ( lebesgue ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are asymptotically independent .",
    "in this sense theorem [ sd1 ] justifies the folklore in the spectral domain analysis of time series : the fourier transforms of stationary processes are asymptotically independent gaussian .",
    "namely , in the spectral or fourier domain , the fourier - transformed processes are asymptotically independent , while the original process can be very strongly dependent ( see example [ ex : lp ] ) .",
    "theorem [ sd1 ] substantially improves the result in @xcite that proves ( [ eq : asclt ] ) under the following stronger condition : @xmath70    we shall also establish the following characterization of the annealed clt .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the identity @xmath72 matrix .",
    "[ annealed ] under the same conditions as in theorem [ sd1 ] on the product space @xmath73\\times\\omega , \\mathcal{b } \\times\\mathcal{f } , \\lambda\\times p)$ ] we have @xmath74\\rightarrow\\lbrack g(u)/2]^{1/2}n(0,\\operatorname{id}_{2})\\qquad \\mbox{under } \\lambda\\times p.\\ ] ] here @xmath75 is a random variable independent of @xmath76 and uniformly distributed on @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath77 is defined by ( [ def1 ] ) .",
    "two types of stochastic processes can be considered concerning the partial sum @xmath6 .",
    "the process @xmath78 indexed by @xmath11 is asymptotically gaussian white noise . for another version ,",
    "we consider @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the integer part of @xmath81 .",
    "we shall prove the following invariance principle :    [ ip ] assume that @xmath82 is stationary ergodic and satisfies ( [ regular ] ) .",
    "then @xmath83 is tight in @xmath84 , and @xmath85\\\\ & & \\qquad\\rightarrow\\lbrack g(u)/2]^{1/2}[w^{\\prime}(t),w^{\\prime\\prime}(t)]\\qquad\\mbox{under } \\lambda\\times p,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 are two independent standard brownian motions independent of @xmath75 , and @xmath75 is a random variable uniformly distributed on @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "we now give some remarks and discussions .",
    "our clt also holds if @xmath40 is not @xmath35-measurable .",
    "then clearly the regularity condition we shall impose is @xmath87    for general adapted sequences our clt result still holds under centering .",
    "let @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 denotes the following limit that holds almost surely and in @xmath91 @xmath92 then , for almost all @xmath48 , we have @xmath93\\rightarrow n\\biggl(0,{\\frac{{g(\\theta)}}{2}}\\operatorname{id}_{2}\\biggr)\\qquad\\mbox{under } p\\ ] ] by applying theorem [ sd1 ] to the stationary sequence @xmath94 .",
    "therefore the conclusion of theorem [ sd1 ] holds if we replace the assumption of regularity ( [ regular ] ) by the following : for @xmath45-almost all @xmath11 @xmath95 now , since @xmath96 , theorem  [ sd1 ] still holds if @xmath97 or under the condition @xmath98    since we use in the proof martingale approximation actually our clt is a conditional clt , that allows for a random change of measure .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we notice that , as a consequence of theorem  [ sd1 ] , for sequences satisfying ( [ regular ] ) the periodogram @xmath99 is asymptotically distributed as @xmath100 for almost all frequencies .    by using the invariance principle in proposition [ ip ] we can get the convergence of many interesting functionals of @xmath6 and periodograms . as a consequence of proposition [ ip ] we can get , for instance , @xmath101 ^{2}\\,d\\theta\\\\ & & \\qquad \\rightarrow e \\bigl\\vert\\sup_{0\\leq t\\leq1}w(t ) \\bigr\\vert^{2 } = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}2\\bigl[1-\\phi\\bigl(\\sqrt{y}\\bigr)\\bigr]\\,dy=1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by noting that @xmath102 for @xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath104 is the standard gaussian distribution function .",
    "here we present several examples of processes for which the conclusions of theorems [ sd1 ] and [ annealed ] hold .",
    "clearly condition ( [ regular ] ) is satisfied if the left tail sigma field @xmath105 is trivial .",
    "these processes are called regular [ see chapter 2 , volume 1 in @xcite ] .",
    "notice , however , that our condition ( [ regular ] ) refers rather to the function @xmath106 in relation to the tail field @xmath107 .",
    "we shall introduce the following mixing coefficients : for any two @xmath22-algebras @xmath108 and @xmath109 define the strong mixing coefficient @xmath110 and the @xmath111-mixing coefficient , also known as maximal coefficient of correlation @xmath112 for the stationary sequence of random variables @xmath47 , @xmath113 denotes the @xmath22-field generated by @xmath114 with indices @xmath115 , and @xmath116 denotes the @xmath22-field generated by @xmath114 with indices @xmath117 . the sequences of coefficients @xmath118 and @xmath119 are then defined by @xmath120 respectively . for strongly mixing sequences , namely the strong mixing coefficients @xmath121 ,",
    "the tail sigma field is trivial [ see claim 2.17a in @xcite ] .",
    "examples of this type include harris recurrent markov chains . if @xmath122 , then the tail sigma field is also trivial [ see proposition 5.6 in @xcite ] .",
    "assume @xmath123 is a stationary gaussian sequence and define @xmath124 .",
    "let @xmath125 be such that @xmath126 and @xmath127 . since any gaussian sequence can be represented as a function of i.i.d .",
    "random variables , the process is then regular .",
    "@xcite considered fourier transforms of functionals of gaussian sequences .",
    "[ ex : lp ] let @xmath128 be i.i.d . and consider @xmath129 . these are regular processes and therefore theorems  [ sd1 ] and [ annealed ] are applicable .",
    "examples include linear processes , functions of linear processes and iterated random functions [ @xcite , among others ] .",
    "for example , let @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are i.i.d . with mean @xmath55 and variance @xmath10 , and @xmath132",
    "are real coefficients with @xmath133 . in this case",
    "@xmath134 is well defined , and , by lemmas [ key ] and [ key2 ] , the spectral density is @xmath57 , where @xmath135 as a specific example , let @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 . by elementary manipulations , the covariances @xmath139 which decays very slowly as @xmath140 , hence suggesting strong dependence .",
    "for this example , condition ( [ eq : wucond ] ) is violated . by the tauberian theorem , as @xmath141 , latexmath:[$g(\\theta ) \\sim\\pi/ ( { |\\theta| \\log^{2 } }     as before , let @xmath23 be a stationary ergodic markov chain with values in a measurable space .",
    "we use the notation and constructions from the . the marginal distribution and the transition metric are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath143 .",
    "in addition @xmath144 denotes the operator @xmath145 .",
    "let @xmath146 be the adjoint operator of the restriction of @xmath144 to @xmath147 and assume @xmath148 .",
    "then , for any @xmath149 the central limit theorem of theorem [ sd1 ] holds . to see this",
    "we shall verify condition ( [ condfn ] ) . by spectral calculus",
    "@xmath150 where @xmath151 denotes the spectral measure of @xmath125 with respect to @xmath144 [ see , e.g. , @xcite for this identity ] . for @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , we have @xmath155 therefore , for @xmath45-almost all @xmath11@xmath156",
    "we shall establish first some preparatory lemmas .",
    "the almost sure convergence in lemma [ key ] was shown by @xcite .",
    "the convergence in @xmath91 is new here .",
    "for @xmath157 we define the projection operator by @xmath158    [ key ] let @xmath159 under ( [ regular ] ) , for @xmath45-almost all @xmath11 ( lebesgue ) , we have @xmath160    by ( [ regular ] ) , @xmath161 , we have @xmath162 , @xmath163-almost surely .",
    "therefore by carleson s ( @xcite ) theorem , for almost all @xmath164 , @xmath165 converges @xmath45-almost surely , where @xmath45 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "denote the limit by @xmath166 .",
    "we now consider the set @xmath167\\times\\omega,\\mbox { where } \\{\\mathcal{p}_{0}s_{n}(\\theta)\\}_{n}\\mbox { does not converge}\\bigr\\}\\ ] ] and notice that almost all sections for @xmath164 fixed have lebesgue measure @xmath55 .",
    "so by fubini s theorem the set @xmath168 has measure @xmath55 in the product space and therefore , again by fubini s theorem , almost all sections for @xmath11 fixed have probability @xmath55 .",
    "it follows that for almost all @xmath11 , @xmath169 almost surely under @xmath163 .",
    "next , by the maximal inequality in @xcite , there is a constant @xmath170 such that @xmath171 \\lambda(d\\theta)\\leq c\\sum_{k}|\\mathcal{p}_{0}x_{k}|_{2}^{2},%\\ ] ] and then we integrate @xmath172 \\lambda(d\\theta)\\leq c\\vert x_{0}\\vert_{2}^{2}<\\infty.\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath173 < \\infty\\qquad\\mbox{for almost all } \\theta.\\ ] ] since @xmath174 , and the last one is integrable for almost all @xmath11 , by the lebesgue dominated convergence we have that @xmath175 converges in @xmath91 .    [ key2 ] let @xmath176 . for all @xmath177 , we have @xmath178 where @xmath179 are defined by ( [ cov ] ) .",
    "so @xmath180 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath50 .",
    "additionally , for almost all @xmath11 , @xmath181    without loss of generality we let @xmath182 and @xmath183 . as",
    "before , let @xmath184 by elementary trigonometric identities , we have @xmath185 since @xmath186 , by orthogonality of martingale differences and stationarity we have that @xmath187 \\\\ & = & \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{l =- n}^{0 } e[(\\mathcal{p}_{l}x_{0})(\\mathcal{p}_{l}x_{j})]\\\\ & = & \\lim_{n \\to\\infty}\\sum_{l=0}^{n - j}e[(\\mathcal{p}_{0}x_{l } ) ( \\mathcal{p}_{0}x_{l+j})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by ( [ eq : may313 ] ) and the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem , as in the proof of lemma [ key ] , ( [ eq : may312 ] ) follows in view of hunt s maximal inequality since @xmath188 is integrable .",
    "now we prove ( [ may311 ] ) . by stationarity",
    ", we have @xmath189 namely @xmath190 is the cesaro average of the sum @xmath191 .",
    "note that @xmath192 is integrable over @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "therefore by the fejr  lebesgue theorem [ cf .",
    "@xcite , page 139 or theorem 15.7 in champeney ( @xcite ) ] , ( [ may311 ] ) holds for @xmath45-almost all @xmath51 $ ] ( lebesgue ) .    in the proof of lemma [ key2 ] , ( [ may315 ] ) implies that the sequence @xmath193 is cesaro summable .",
    "it turns out that , generally speaking , @xmath194 may not exist for almost all @xmath11 .",
    "consider the example in @xcite [ see also theorem 3.1 , page 305 , in @xcite ] : there exists a sequence of nonnegative trigonometric polynomials @xmath195 with constant term @xmath196 , a  sequence of positive integers @xmath197 and a positive sequence @xmath198 , such that the function @xmath199 is integrable .",
    "however , for almost all @xmath11 , the fourier sum @xmath200 diverges , where @xmath201 is the fourier coefficient of @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath202 . by herglotz s theorem [ @xcite ]",
    ", there exists a stationary process @xmath4 such that its spectral distribution function is @xmath59 and its covariance function is @xmath203 .",
    "[ ui ] assume ( [ regular ] ) .",
    "on the product space @xmath73\\times\\omega , \\mathcal{b}\\times\\mathcal{f } , \\lambda\\times p)$ ] we have that @xmath204    let @xmath205 be a positive integer .",
    "we shall decompose the partial sums in a sum of @xmath205 martingales and a remainder in the following way : @xmath206 notice that for any @xmath207,@xmath208 is a martingale adapted to the filtration @xmath209 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath47 is a stationary sequence with variables square integrable , it follows that @xmath210 is a uniformly integrable sequence .",
    "this fact implies that for @xmath211 fixed the sequence @xmath212 is also uniformly integrable .",
    "it follows that @xmath213 is a martingale with uniformly integrable differences under the measure @xmath214 .",
    "it is known that for a martingale with uniformly integrable differences we have @xmath215 is uniformly integrable [ see , e.g. , @xcite , proposition 1 ] .",
    "the result follows since by @xcite maximal inequality @xmath216 and therefore , denoting by @xmath217 the expected value with respect to @xmath214 , we have by regularity condition ( [ regular ] ) that @xmath218 & \\leq & \\frac{c}{n}\\sum_{l=1}% ^{n}e|e_{l - m}(x_{l})|^{2}\\\\ & = & ce|e_{-m}(x_{0})|^{2}\\rightarrow0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath219 uniformly in @xmath220 .",
    "so , the uniform integrability follows .",
    "the first assertion of theorem [ sd1 ] is just lemma  [ key ] .",
    "we now prove ( [ eq : asclt ] ) .",
    "_ step _ 1 . _ the construction of martingale .",
    "_    define the projector operator by ( [ proj ] ) .",
    "then we construct as in lemma [ key ] @xmath221 and then by lemma [ key ] for almost all @xmath11 @xmath222 to verify it is a martingale we start from @xmath223 and by the contractive property of the conditional expectation @xmath224 we then construct the sequence of stationary martingale differences @xmath225 , given by @xmath226    _ step _ 2 .",
