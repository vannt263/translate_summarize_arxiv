    "polarimetric imaging provides a unique window on the 3-dimensional structure of astrophysical objects , and therefore on the physical processes operating in a wide range of stellar and interstellar environments .",
    "the most important processes giving rise to interstellar polarization are scattering by dust , and transmission through aligned dust grains .",
    "imaging polarimetry has been applied to many targets as a primary means of determining the scattering properties of dust , and to obtain geometric information on extended and complex sources ( e.g. , reflection nebulae , active galactic nuclei , and comets ) .",
    "the vacuum ultraviolet is an especially favorable wavelength regime for these studies ; polarimetric efficiencies are high , and polarized backgrounds are low ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a relatively small number of bright stars emit the majority of vuv photons , greatly simplifying the accurate tracing of source - scatterer - detector geometry over the case in the optical and near infrared .",
    "the university of wisconsin s _ wide - field imaging survey polarimeter _ ( wisp ) was developed to obtain the first wide - field astronomical polarization images in the vacuum ultraviolet .",
    "this rocket - borne instrument has been flown three times to date , providing high - quality images of reflection nebulosity in the pleiades open cluster ( @xcite , @xcite , gibson & nordsieck 1999 , in preparation ) , and photopolarimetry of comet hale - bopp ( @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , wisp obtained polarimetric images of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ; these observations represent the first wide - field , uv polarization images ever obtained ( @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the lmc data ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) found that the diffuse uv light is polarized at a 510% level , consistent with starlight scattered by dust ; that the strongest source of illumination in the wisp field is the h ii complex n11 ; and that the uv starlight must account for most of the heating of diffuse dust in the lmc .    in this paper , we report on our program to model the wisp polarization maps of the lmc using a monte carlo radiation transfer code to constrain the optical properties and scattering geometry of the dust in the lmc s diffuse interstellar medium .  1.1 and  1.2 , respectively ,",
    "describe the observational results which motivate this work , and the interpretive issues addressed by our models .    in  2 ,",
    "we describe in detail the basic astrophysical ingredients of our models , which are the distributions in space , size , and luminosity of the illuminating ob associations and scattering dust medium . in ",
    "3 we discuss the scattering and polarizing properties of the dust grains and the way in which we parameterize the total amount of dust present .",
    " 4 describes the monte carlo engine of our radiation transfer code , which is innovative in its ability to track the processing of near - uv photons into thermal ir radiation by heated interstellar dust grains . in",
    "5 the modelling algorithm is explained , relating the procedure by which we explored parameter space for the `` best '' models . ",
    "6 presents the model images and polarization maps and the conclusions we can draw about the inclination of the lmc disk and the scattering asymmetry of its dust grains .",
    "we are careful to note the many shortcomings of this simple model , which nonetheless reproduces many of the observed near - ultraviolet and far - infrared properties of the lmc for a reasonable set of inputs .      a 1@xmath65 @xmath7 4@xmath68 area of the western side of the lmc",
    "was observed with the rocket - borne wide - field imaging survey polarimeter ( wisp ) on november 20 , 1995 .",
    "4 @xmath7 80 second exposures in an intermediate - band , near ultraviolet filter ( @xmath8 = 2150  , @xmath9 = 300  ) were used to create intensity and polarization maps of the field .",
    "the observations were centered at @xmath10 = 04@xmath11 59@xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath1467@xmath3 53@xmath15 @xmath16 ( j2000.0 ) and aligned roughly north - south .",
    "the wisp instrument is described in detail in @xcite ; the reduction , calibration , and analysis of the lmc flight data are given in paper i.    the minimum diffuse uv surface brightness , 5.6 @xmath173.1 @xmath7 10@xmath18 erg s@xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath19 sr@xmath19 , is larger than any known stray light background , and is clearly due to light originating within the lmc .",
    "the surface brightness of this diffuse uv background is correlated with areas of high h i column density and is linearly polarized at the @xmath2110% level .",
    "this suggests that reflected ob starlight contributes at least half of the lmc s diffuse uv background .",
    "the ism of the large magellanic cloud apparently acts as a kiloparsec - scale reflection nebula in the near ultraviolet .",
    "paper i found evidence for weak centro - symmetric scattering halos around some of the large ob complexes in the wisp field .",
    "the b2 complex ( martin _ et al .",
    "_ 1976 ) , however , lacked such a halo ; this was interpreted to mean that b2 is located either within an h i hole or well above the plane of the lmc disk .",
    "it is desirable to test the interpretation of paper i ; to this end we have undertaken to model the radiation transfer of ultraviolet photons from their origins in hot stars , through the dusty ism of the lmc s disk , to earth . using these models",
    "we hope to determine whether or not the observed level of polarization is consistent with the reflection nebula interpretation .",
    "we also wish to determine the expected polarization pattern around b2 for a location within the disk ; perhaps a non - detection of centro - symmetry is to be expected for this region .    using a specialized monte carlo radiation transfer code",
    ", we set out to determine whether or not reasonable values for the dust optical depth , scattering geometry , and dust grain optical properties can account for the wisp observations . under the assumption that the reflection nebula interpretation is correct , we can use the polarization properties of the model to place constraints on the dust properties and inclination of the disk of the lmc .",
    "the perfect model of the large magellanic cloud would incorporate the luminosity contributions of every field star and star cluster into its input parameters .",
    "this is obviously impractical , and so we must find a more tractable subset of objects with which to illuminate the lmc s dust . the star - formation rate of lmc field stars has been roughly constant for the past @xmath512 gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this recent activity has been accompanied by the formation of a large number of `` blue populous '' star clusters and ob associations ; the young clusters of the lmc are both more frequent per unit field star mass and individually larger than their milky way counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "data from the uit instrument suggests that @xmath575% of the flux from the lmc at @xmath8 = 1500 @xmath16 originates from stellar associations within the regions of nebulosity catalogued by @xcite ( @xcite ) . for the western side of the lmc ( observed by wisp )",
    ", this interpretation holds true at 2150  . in the wisp image ,",
    "most of the well - detected sources can be identified with ob associations ( @xcite ) , or open clusters younger than @xmath5200 myr .",
    "clusters older than this , e.g. , the massive 1 gyr - old young globular cluster ngc 1783 , are undetected in our image .",
    "individual supergiants among the field stars ( @xcite ) can be detected , but are minor contributors to the total observed flux .",
    "we therefore chose to take as our illuminators the 122 ob associations of @xcite , because a homogeneous dataset of ultraviolet photometry at two wavelengths exists for the entire sample ( @xcite , hereinafter sch ) . due to the lack of a uniform sample of ultraviolet photometry",
    ", we have ignored the young open clusters in this first model ; some of these clusters , e.g. , ngc 1818 , ngc 1755 , and ngc 1711 , contribute significant uv flux to the wisp image .",
    "the positions of the ob associations from @xcite were transformed onto the model s rectilinear coordinate system at a scale of 15@xmath15 per grid unit .",
    "the scale was chosen in order to accomodate output images of the entire lmc , and the grid spacing is well - matched to the final , binned resolution of the wisp observations .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system was chosen following @xcite to lie at 05@xmath22 24@xmath23 , @xmath1469@xmath3 50@xmath15 ( b1950.0 ) ; this corresponds to the centroid of optical light in the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of ob associations in the lmc , as in the galaxy , can be assigned some finite scale height above and below the galactic midplane . however , because this scale height is likely to be smaller than the scale height of dust ( @xcite ) , and we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of the relative positions of each association along the line of sight , we have forced the illuminating sources in our models to lie in the plane of the lmc disk .",
    "ob associations are not point sources , having radii of @xmath5 15150 pc ( @xcite ) ; for simplicity , we have modelled them as spheres .",
    "the radii of our illuminators do not directly correspond to the optically defined dimensions of the lucke & hodge associations , but were determined from the vacuum ultraviolet images of sch .",
    "sch photometered the entire lucke & hodge catalog at 1500 and 1900  , using rectangular apertures that were matched to each association by hand ; their table 1 gives the total area of each of their apertures .",
    "we assigned radii to our spherical sources by setting their projected surface areas equal to the areas given by sch in their table 1 . in just two cases ( lh 15 and lh 77 )",
    "did we deem the deviations from sphericality strong enough to warrant a more complex procedure .",
    "both associations lie within supergiant shells on the northern side of the lmc disk .",
    "lh 15 , within lmc-1 , is contained within the field of view of the wisp ccd image ; lh 77 , at the center of lmc-4 , is quite bright and resembles a quadrant of a circle s circumference .",
    "these two associations were broken up arbitrarily into four identical sub - associations , which more closely reproduced the visual appearance of these sources .",
    "near - uv luminosities were assigned to the sources based on the photometry of sch at 1500 @xmath16 ( @xmath24 ) and 1900 @xmath16 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we dereddeded the sch photometry and applied a correction for the difference in bandpass between their filters and the wisp filter at 2150  .",
    "the reddening values given by @xcite were broken down into lmc and foreground galactic components ; following sch , the maximum value of foreground reddening was taken to be e@xmath26 @xmath27 0.07 mag .",
    "any additional reddening towards the individual associations was attributed to dust within the lmc .",
    "reddening values for each source were derived following the procedure outlined in paper i , as were corrections for the differing bandpasses used by sch and in paper i. the derived extinction values were found to be in good agreement with those published by @xcite in an erratum to sch .",
    "the bandpass corrections ranged from @xmath140.5 mag to @xmath00.6 mag for the 122 lucke - hodge ob associations .",
    "the corrected magnitudes were converted into monochromatic fluxes for the monte carlo photon generator using the standard relation f@xmath28 ( sch ) .",
    "the source positions , radii , and luminosities are given in an appendix to this paper , in table a1 .",
    "the lmc is a disk galaxy and we have chosen to represent its dust density distribution using an exponential decay with radius and a hyperbolic secant law in height above the midplane ( @xcite ) :    @xmath29    where the constant @xmath30 is set by the optical depth of the model ( see  3 below ) , and the dust scale length @xmath31 and scale height @xmath32 are taken from the literature .",
    "observational estimates of the lmc s dust scale length were unavailable , and so we set @xmath31 @xmath33 2.6 kpc ( 12 grid units ) , the scale length of the old stellar population ( @xcite ) .    the dust scale height , @xmath32 , must also be estimated indirectly .",
    "@xcite measured two reddening - free photometric indices for 2069 o and b stars in a 2.9 deg@xmath34 area centered @xmath21 2@xmath66 northwest of the optical center of the lmc . using the distribution of reddening values they found that the data could be well - matched by a vertical distribution",
    "in which the dust has a scale height equal to twice that of the ob stars . assuming the ob stars to lie in an extremely flattened disk , with scale height @xmath5 100 pc ( c.f .",

    "azimuthally symmetric model dusk disk , we placed nine low - density cavities into the model , corresponding to the supergiant shells of @xcite .",
    "these shells were identified by the enhancements of h@xmath10 emission around their perimeters and are also characterized by extremely low hi column densities .",
    "they are thought to be roughly cylindrical , and `` open - topped '' ( @xcite ) , but in our models they are defined by simple spherical cavities of low optical depth .",
    "the cavities are placed in the midplane of our model galaxy , using the positions and sizes from @xcite .",
    "we assign a density to the cavities by defining the near - uv optical depth @xmath35 across the diameter of a cavity .",
    "@xmath35 was derived from photometric measures of the reddening , e@xmath36 , of the ob associations lying within the boundaries of the supergiant shells .",
    "these lie in the range 0.00 @xmath37 e@xmath36 @xmath38 0.12 ( @xcite ) , less 0.07 mag of foreground reddening ; we also assumed that roughly half of the observed reddening towards the ob associations was due to material in the near neighborhood of the stars and hence not a contributor to the optical depth of the cavity as a whole .",
    "we adopted a `` typical '' e@xmath36 of 0.01 mag , and assumed the ob associations to lie at the center of the spherical cavities ; applying an lmc extinction law for the model s 2150 @xmath16 photons , we set @xmath35 = 0.1 .",
    "the catalog of supergiant shell parameters is given in the appendix , in table a2 ; the cavities and illuminators are mapped out in figure [ sources ] .",
    "the inclination of the lmc disk to the plane of the sky remains a matter of some debate ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has become clear that the east ( 30 dor ) side of the lmc is closer than the western ( wisp field ) side . as shown in table 3.5 of @xcite ,",
    "both the inclination i and position angle line of nodes @xmath39 are known only to a precision of a few tens of degrees . measurements of @xmath39 scatter around a north - south line , and so we adopt @xmath40 for simplicity .",
    "geometrical methods applied to young and old stellar populations as well as neutral and ionized gas have yielded results varying between 25@xmath41 i @xmath42 .",
    "the expected magnitude and spatial variation of polarization depend strongly on the scattering geometry in the disk of the model galaxy , and so we consider three values for i in our models : 28@xmath3 , 36@xmath3 , and 45@xmath3 .",
    "the wisp field , along the west side of the lmc , is tilted away from the earth : as the inclination increases , photons must traverse larger path lengths through the absorbing dust layer in order to escape and be seen .",
    "along with the scattering geometry , the optical properties of interstellar dust grains control the linear polarization of stellar photons .",
    "our models treat the scattering process using a standard henyey - greenstein phase function ( @xcite ) , which depends on the albedo @xmath43 , and asymmetry parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 defines the probability for an incident photon to scatter through an angle @xmath44 : p(@xmath44 ) @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath1 = 0 yields isotropic scattering , while @xmath1 = 1 gives pure forward scattering ; @xmath1 @xmath47 0 corresponds to backscattering . to model the polarization",

    "@xmath48 is the maximum polarization attainable in a single scattering event , for a scattering angle of 90@xmath3 ; the polarization of the scattered photon decreases for smaller and larger scattering angles .",
    "the total amount of dust in the model is described by the single optical depth parameter @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath50 is simply the optical depth of the model galaxy to a photon as it travels from center to edge through the midplane .",
    "@xcite tabulated the scattering properties of the @xcite ( mrn ) milky way dust mixture .",
    "deviations from the @xcite values are to be expected for the lmc , which is in general more metal - poor than the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lmc extinction curve shows a less pronounced 2175 @xmath16 bump and a steeper rise into the far - uv than does the galactic curve , attributable to variations in dust grain sizes and/or compositions ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recalculated the albedo of magellanic cloud dust using an mrn grain - size distribution with the relative contributions from graphite and silicates scaled to match the observed mean extinction curves .",
    "we adopt the pei ( 1992 ) value , @xmath43 = 0.66 for @xmath8 = 2150  , for all our models ; this is @xmath525% higher than the observed albedo of milky way dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite did not include calculations for @xmath1 or @xmath51 in his paper ; we adopt the mrn - based value , @xmath51 = 0.31 . because the polarization of scattered starlight depends strongly on @xmath1 , we compute families of models in which @xmath1 is permitted to vary .    in the ultraviolet , the phase function asymmetry parameter @xmath1",
    "is poorly constrained by both models ( 0.1 @xmath38 @xmath1 @xmath380.7 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and observations , ( 0.3 @xmath38 @xmath1 @xmath380.9 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , even for milky way dust .",
    "variations in @xmath1 lead to differences in the expected polarization patterns , allowing us to infer its value through comparisons of the model output to observations .",
    "we chose to examine the moderately to strongly forward - throwing regime : @xmath1 = 0.64 , corresponding to the mrn value , and @xmath1 = 0.90 , suggested by observations of reflection nebulae in the pleaides cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "intermediate values were chosen at @xmath1 = 0.70 , 0.77 , 0.83 , close to the values derived by @xcite for the reflection nebula ngc 7023 .",
    "the most recent models of the pleiades nebulosity ( gibson & nordsieck 1999 , in preparation ) also indicate a moderate value for @xmath1 .    for the lmc ,",
    "the parameterization of dust mass using @xmath50 is problematic , because the lmc is observed nearly face on and thus the derived value of @xmath50 is strongly geometry - dependent .",
    "we derive an initial optical depth from observations of ob associations ( @xcite ) , scaled by a geometric factor , and then correct this value using the observed ultraviolet ( paper i ) to far - infrared ( @xcite ) flux ratios .",
    "@xcite found a mean b - band optical depth through the face - on lmc @xmath52 = 0.98 @xmath7 cos i. using the lmc mean extinction curve of @xcite , the 2150 @xmath16 optical depth to the lmc s midplane is @xmath53 = @xmath54 = 1.2 @xmath7 cos i. the @xcite field is offset some 0.67 radial scale lengths from the centroid of our dust distribution , and so we adopt a pole - to - midplane central optical depth @xmath55 = 2.4 @xmath7 cos i. @xmath50 is finally obtained by scaling @xmath55 by the flattening ratio of the disk .",
    "we adopt as our initial value :    @xmath56    this number was adjusted during the modelling procedure in order to match the observed ratio of wisp 2150 @xmath16 flux to iras 60 @xmath57 m flux ( see  5 , below ) .",
    "we construct model scattered light images with a monte carlo continuum radiation transfer code which accounts for multiple photon scattering , and predicts the spatially resolved flux and polarization ( @xcite ) . in the radiation transfer calculation , the dust plus gas mixture has albedo , @xmath43 , and a scattering phase function approximated by the henyey - greenstein phase function ( @xcite ) with asymmetry parameter , @xmath1 ( section  3 ) .",
    "the code has been modified from the axisymmetric models of wood & jones to include a three dimensional distribution of illuminating sources ( section  2.1 )  this is crucial for modeling the uv scattered light pattern in the lmc .",
    "additionally , we have added a new feature , where absorbed photons are not removed from the simulation , but `` re - radiated '' isotropically from the point of absorption to form a `` far - infrared '' image .",
    "this is a first approximation for predicting the far ir emission from our simulations .",
    "we are in effect assuming that all the uv emission that is absorbed is reradiated at one wavelength where the dust is optically thin . in order to compare our models to the wisp and iras images of the lmc",
    ", we must include additional factors that account for the fact that our `` reprocessing '' technique does not enforce radiative equilibrium ( section  5 ) .",
    "with the dust distribution and ob association properties held constant for all models , our goal is to find the combination of disk inclination and scattering phase function that best reproduces the observed polarization maps of paper i. the polarimetric images of the lmc are the result of the interplay of a large number of physical processes and properties : the vertical , radial , and azimuthal dust distributions , the clumpiness of the dust , grain albedos , the distances above or below the midplane of each illuminating source , and the morphologies and densities of the supergiant shells all contribute to the observed polarization pattern .    by tuning all of these quantities independently in our models ,",
    "we _ could _",
    "create a model whose output reproduces the observations precisely .",
    "however , such a model would almost certainly be non - unique , and its physical reality would be highly questionable .",
    "we prefer instead to hold most of the model traits fixed and consider only the variation in the parameters that are expected to most strongly influence the polarization maps .",
    "for example , one of the observables we insist the models match is the ratio of ultraviolet to far - infrared light escaping from the galaxy . in reality",
    ", this obviously depends on the uv albedo @xmath43 , but because @xmath58 @xmath59 1 and @xmath60 @xmath61 1 , it also depends on the optical depth .",
    "we could trade off albedo and optical depth to tune this ratio precisely , but the model would suffer from severe non - uniqueness and could be driven to unphysical values of @xmath43 , @xmath62 , or both .",
    "therefore we fix @xmath43 ( see section 3 ) , and adjust @xmath62 until the model produces approximately the correct amount of infrared light .",
    "we consider a grid of 15 models ( see table 1 ) , comprising 3 values of disk inclination i , and 5 values for scattering phase function @xmath1 .",
    "for each model , we perform an initial run in order to determine the correction to our first guess at @xmath50 .",
    "if the emitting dust is smoothly distributed and in radiative equilibrium , then the relation between absorbed starlight and thermal emission in the far - infrared depends simply on the dust optical depth .",
    "hence we can attempt to match the amount of dust in our models to the true dust mass by a comparison of uv to ir fluxes ; we correct our intial value of @xmath50 by matching the model images in the uv and ir to the observed wisp 2150@xmath16 and iras 60 @xmath57 m images .",

    "we re - ran the best fitting model with 10@xmath74 photons in order to more accurately assess the mean level of polarization and track the variation in polarization level and position angle across the image . as we began to write up these results",
    ", we continued to let the model run in order to create the highest possible signal - to - noise in the output images .",
    "our models produced as their output a set of four images for each run : the ultraviolet and infrared flux , and , in the ultraviolet , images of the linearly polarized flux q and u. for analysis , the output data were converted into fits format and examined within the iraf suite of tasks .",
    "model images of the wisp - observed portion of the lmc are shown in figure [ quad ] . from left to right , we show the model uv image , the wisp 2150   image , the iras 60 @xmath57 m image , and the model ir image .",
    "the far left and right panels of figure [ quad ] show the co - added results of multiple monte carlo runs , amounting to a total photon count of 4.1 @xmath7 10@xmath74 .",
    "only a portion of the image is shown , to facilitate comparison to the wisp data ( middle left panel of figure [ quad ] ) .",
    "the dynamic range of the uv model is significantly smaller than the 2150   data , because of the uniformly high optical depth in our models which results in nearly constant attenuation across the field .",
    "many of the features are well - reproduced by the models , including the prominent n 11 and b2 complexes which particularly dominate the iras 60 @xmath57 m image .",
    "the supergiant shells are less visible than expected in the model ir image ; it lacks the `` holes '' visible in the 60 @xmath57 m data .",
    "however , their effect can be noted by comparison of the uv and ir appearance of the lh15 association at the upper right of the panels in figure [ quad ] : lh15 is far brighter in the uv than the ir , a consequence of its location within the shell lmc-1 ( see figure [ sources ] ) .    despite the obvious , and",
    "expected , lack of fine - scale structure in our model , we nonetheless are able to approximate the large - scale luminosity distribution in these two wavelength regimes .",
    "the most obvious failure of our model to reproduce small - scale structure in the dust distribution occurs at the association lh12 ( see figure [ sources ] ) .",
    "lh12 is an intrinsically bright association ( sch ) that is highly reddened ( lucke 1974 ) and so appears faint to observers .",
    "however , lh12 lies within the lmc-6 supergiant shell ; in our simple model , this drastically reduces the amount of obscuring dust along the lh12 sightline , causing us to dramatically overestimate the observed brightness of the association .",
    "a similar effect is discernible for the more southerly association lh5 , highly reddened despite its position near the edge of the lmc-7 supergiant shell .",
    "we created images of the degree of linear polarization , @xmath75 , and position angle @xmath44 :    @xmath76    we created polarization maps with vector length proportional to p and position angle equal to @xmath44 ; our highest s / n map is shown in figure [ model ] .",
    "the smooth dust distribution and finite number of illuminating sources account for the extreme regularity of the model polarization map .    in order to constrain the disk inclination of the lmc and the phase function @xmath1 of its dust , we compared the model polarization maps to those produced by paper i from the wisp observations , shown side - by - side in figure [ wisp ] .",
    "the wisp observations , binned into 6@xmath15 @xmath16 pixels to increase signal - to - noise , showed some evidence for the presence of centro - symmetry about the brightest ob associations , but were hampered by the shortage of photons far from these bright regions ; the effects of inhomogeneities in the scattering medium and a diffuse starlight component clearly dominate the appearance of the observed polarization maps .",
    "our points of comparison included the mean p and @xmath44 , the shape of the high - polarization tail of p , the degree of centro - symmetry around the brighest regions ( n11 [ b1 ] in north and n79 [ b2 ] in the south ) , and the offsets of the polarization symmetry centers from the central ob associations .",
    "we also looked for variations in mean p and @xmath44 across the @xmath77 @xmath7 @xmath78 field of view , but found no statistically significant differences to distinguish the various models .",
    "a    the comparison was not straightforward because of the systematic effects which dominate the errors in the observed polarization maps .",
    "in particular , the mean value of p was determined quite carefully : the wisp maps have been cleaned of marginal polarization detections where p @xmath47 2.5@xmath79 , and become incomplete for polarizations less than 10% .",
    "therefore we applied a linear incompletess correction to the models , such that the model polarizations are weighted progressively less between 10% and 4% , and all polarizations smaller than 4% are ignored .",
    "this mimics the observational bias towards detection of regions of high polarization .    the observed polarization maps , biased by incompleteness toward the detection of high polarization regions , showed a much higher scatter in polarization values than did the models .",
    "the observations also show a patchier distribution of p ; pixels with polarizations in the 510% range are frequently juxtaposed with @xmath520% polarized regions .",
    "this indicates that the effects of small , optically thick clumps in the ism are strongly influencing the scattered light component of the diffuse uv background .",
    "however , when we binned the models to the resolution of the observations and corrected for incompleteness at p @xmath47 10% , our models were consistent with the observed mean level of polarization across the wisp field .",
    "scattered light from ob associations is indeed likely to account for a large fraction of the diffuse ultraviolet background in the lmc .",
    "we found that our model polarization maps were sensitive to variations in @xmath1 and i ; see figure [ n11 ] . as @xmath1 increased from 0.64 to 0.90 , the mean",
    "polarization @xmath80 increased from @xmath512.5% to @xmath513.7% .",
    "the disk inclination manifested itself most noticeably in the distribution of polarization vectors around bright sources , e.g. , n11 . for a face - on disk of scattering material , the polarization vectors form a centro - symmetric pattern about the illuminating source ; the inclination introduces an asymmetry which shifts the center of the distribution away from the illuminator , perpendicular to the disk s line of nodes . as the inclination was increased , the offset in symmetry center of the polarization patterns ( hereafter referred to as @xmath13x ) varied from 0@xmath8136 eastward , at 28@xmath3 , to 16@xmath812 westward , at 45@xmath3 .",
    "these results are summarized in table 1 , and plotted in figure [ result ] , in which @xmath80 and @xmath13x are plotted for each model .",
    "we have also plotted @xmath80 and @xmath13x for the observed polarization map , with the associated error bars .",
    "@xmath13x tends to zero at inclinations of @xmath3830@xmath3 due to the competing effects of the disk inclination and the radial drop in dust density from east to west across the field ; a plane parallel slab of scattering dust would show @xmath13x = 0 only for i = 0 .",
    "interpolating in inclination , and adopting the uncertainty in our observational determination of @xmath13x from the binned wisp data , we find that the lmc s disk is inclined at 36@xmath4 to the plane of the sky .",
    "insofar as the western side of the lmc resembles our models , this is a direct , geometric determination of its inclination .",
    "although inconsistent with recent kinematic determinations ( e.g. , @xcite , who found i = 22@xmath3 @xmath176@xmath3 ) ,",
    "it is squarely in agreement with the average of reliable values tabulated by @xcite .",
    "if the dust scale height is larger than we have assumed , then the inclination required to yield a given @xmath13x is reduced ; a significant change in @xmath32 would be required due to the concentration of scattering dust close to the midplane of the disk .",
    "it is more difficult to draw conclusions regarding @xmath1 .",
    "as seen clearly in figure [ result ] , the effect of high @xmath1 is mainly to increase the mean level of polarization .",
    "this ran counter to our expectations , for a high value of @xmath1 should produce smaller scattering angles , on average , resulting in polarizations much smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "the counterintuitive result is due to our simulation of the observational biases in the data of paper i ( see section 6.1 ) ; the high @xmath1 models did initially show lower levels of polarization , but were cleaned more severely by our rejection of low p pixels .",
    "the low signal - to - noise of the wisp data and the larger than expected polarization fluctuations result in uncomfortably large errors in our determination of @xmath80 . at the 3@xmath82 level",
    ", we can not rule out any value of @xmath1 between 0 and 1 . at the 1@xmath82 level",
    ", we find @xmath1 = 0.7 @xmath170.3 .",
    "the simple comparison of @xmath83 to @xmath84 throws away information about the distribution of @xmath80 within the images : we found that for @xmath1 = 0.830.90 , our models exhibited a strong high - p tail extending to @xmath530% .",
    "this tail was weak in the observations , and suggests that such high values of @xmath1 are less likely than would be inferred from the formal error distribution .",
    "however , as noted in paper i , the highest polarization pixels typically show low flux values , and hence relatively large errors in both p and @xmath44 .",
    "low signal - to - noise might therefore introduce a bias against the high-@xmath1 models .",
    "our determination of @xmath1 is of comparable precision to values for the diffuse milky way dust , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ; because of the complex scattering geometry it is far less precise than determinations based on galactic reflection nebulae , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our value depends critically on the smoothness of the dust distribution as well as the relative positions along the line - of - sight of illuminators and scatterers ( @xcite , gibson & nordsieck 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "also , as shown in figure [ quad ] , the true distribution of ultraviolet luminosity in the lmc contains a non - negligible component due to stars not in the lucke - hodge associations .",
    "this additional source of direct , unpolarized , light would dilute the scattered light and hence reduce @xmath80 if included in the models .",
    "in such a model , higher values of @xmath1 would be required to account for the observed level of polarization .",
    "paper i lists nine uv - bright regions which appear to support scattering halos with the expected centro - symmetric pattern ; we explore here the degree to which the simple model is able to reproduce these features of the polarization map .      two open clusters and a modest - sized star - forming region , these objects show some evidence of scattering halos ; however , they are not included in our models .",
    "these bright ob associations support scattering halos .",
    "the models reproduce them quite strongly .",
    "the northern associations lh 15 and n11 dominate the local uv radiation field , and are well detected in the wisp observations .",
    "lh 12 is far brighter in the model than is observed , a consequence of the strong deviation from smoothness of the surrounding dust structures ( see  6.1 ) .",
    "the observed scattering halo around lh 12 is quite weak , indicative of the contribution of increasing field star density in the southern half of the wisp field ( paper i ) .",
    "these regions show very weak evidence of scattering halos in the wisp image . in the models , there is little apparent indication of centro - symmetry about these associations .",
    "we note that each of these associations lies very close to the edge of the wisp image .",
    "moreover , they lie near or within the scattering halos of brighter associations . these must be considered marginal detections .",
    "[ [ b2 ] ] b2 ^^    the b2 complex is made up of associations lh 1 , 2 , 5 , and 8 ; its large ob star population led us to expect the presence of a strong centro - symmetric scattering halo .",
    "to the contrary , the paper i analysis of the wisp observations found no such halo .",
    "possible explanations were suggested : the location of b2 above the plane of the dust layer , location of b2 within a large h i hole , or a possible bias against detection of scattering halos larger than @xmath540@xmath15 .",
    "our model polarization maps show a centro - symmetric halo around b2 ; however , comparison to the comparable associations n11 and lh 15 showed it to be weaker than the halos of the northern associations .",
    "this is due , in the models , to the extnded ( non - point - source ) size of b2 , as well as the contribution of light from lh 12 and other associations beyond the wisp field of view .",
    "in addition , the observations are degraded by the presence of high field star density in the southern wisp field , as well as the existence of a significant hole in the h i distribution ( s. kim , private communication ) .",
    "part of this h i hole corresponds to the h@xmath10  supergiant shell lmc-7 ( meaburn 1980 ) , which coincides with lh 8 .",
    "we conclude that the paper i non - detection of a scattering halo around b2 is astrophysical and not due to bias in their analysis , but the placement of the complex above the plane of the dust is not required by the observations .",
    "this suite of models represents our first attempt to model the radiation transfer of polarized light through a galaxy from a large number of discrete sources within a non - uniform dust layer .",
    "these models are able to reproduce the general morphology of ultraviolet and infrared images of the lmc ; taken together with observed polarization data , they yield astrophysically interesting constraints on its inclination , and show consistency with dust properties expected from observations of the milky way",
    ".    however , the models provide a greatly simplified picture of the true structure of the lmc . future adaptations of the radiation transfer code will address many of the simplifications ; for others , additional observational material is required in order to refine our input parameters . a more advanced version of the monte carlo code ( dubbed `` galaxy on a grid '' ) , will allow the specification of dust and luminosity density at each individual point in the model grid ; this flexibility will permit the exploration of arbitrarily complex geometries in future work .",
    "the most severe drawback of our model is the adoption of a smooth dust distribution that lacks optically thick clumps .",
    "as noted by earlier authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the presence of small - scale , dense knots of absorbing material can greatly alter the emergent spectral - energy distribution of a galaxy s light . in this case ,",
    "inferred values of @xmath1 are incorrect , and our ability to distinguish dust optical properties from the scattering geometry is lost ( @xcite , gibson & nordsieck 1999 , in preparation ) . since the distribution of small - scale dust knots in the lmc is unknown , we have little recourse but to adopt a relatively homogeneous distribution of dust . the obvious effect of this approximation",
    "is that our models lack the large polarization fluctuations seen in the observations , presumably attributable to the presence of the patchy distribution of optically thick dust clouds .",
    "a related drawback is the unknown line - of - sight distribution of illuminators relative to the dust .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the relative amounts of scattering and absorption depend sensitively on where the illuminating sources lie relative to the dust . along the same lines",
    ", we have modelled the supergiant shells as spheres , whereas evidence suggests they more closely resemble cylinders",
    ". one obvious effect of this mismatch is the presence of a foreground `` haze '' of ir emission above the shells in our models , which is not present in the iras data ( see figure [ quad ] ) .",
    "the dust scale length in our models is highly uncertain ; if we had chosen to adopt the scale length of h i inferred from the maps of @xcite , our derived @xmath31 would have been some 40% smaller than the value we used .",
    "this in turn would have required a higher @xmath50 in order to reproduce the uv@xmath14ir color of the diffuse light at the position of the wisp observations .",
    "future models , using the galaxy on a grid system , would be set up to more closely match the complex column - density variations seen in the @xcite h i maps , and therefore obviate the necessity of parameterization using @xmath31 .",
    "although our scattering medium is unrealistically smooth , our stellar sources suffer from the opposite problem : we have considered only emission from large ob associations , ignoring the contributions of young , massive , open clusters and the field star population .",
    "this yields a model with a very highly clumped luminosity distribution ; because our models ignore the direct stellar contribution to the diffuse ultraviolet light , they will tend to produce higher levels of polarization that would otherwise be observed .",
    "for this reason , our predicted value of @xmath1 is likely to be skewed towards lower values than a more complex model would produce . in future work",
    ", it will be desirable to add a smoothly varying component to the starlight , taken for example from the large - scale maps of @xcite .",
    "our models extend over the central @xmath510@xmath3 @xmath7 10@xmath3 of the large magellanic cloud , roughly 14 times the area covered by the wisp observations .",
    "this allows us to predict the general pattern of polarization that might be seen across the face of the lmc at near - ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "our models have been tuned to reproduce the optical depths and polarizations of the wisp field ; a test of their validity and generality would be a comparison of our predictions to future ultraviolet polarimetric datasets across rest of the large cloud .    in figure",
    "[ predict ] , we show the ultraviolet polarization vectors from our best model for the entire lmc . an optical image of the galaxy ( sandage 1961 ) is plotted to provide orientation and scale .",
    "if our model is valid , figure [ predict ] should predict the pattern of polarization across the face of the lmc .",
    "the predictions of the model are most uncertain in the region of the bar , which contains a high - surface brightness , intermediate - age population of field stars and numerous young open clusters not acounted for in our models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we comment upon some regions of interest that may be likely future targets for polarimetric study .",
    "we see that the 30 dor region itself shows low levels of polarization , although it is responsible for much of the scattered light within a kiloparsec or more .",
    "the bar is expected to show low levels of polarization ( @xmath38 5% ) , with most of that due to 30 dor at the eastern end .",
    "the bright h ii region n51 ( north of the central bar ) should produce a centrosymmetric pattern similar to that of n11 ( in the wisp field ) , although it will be weakened on the eastern and southern sides by radiation from 30 dor .",
    "finally , the southern spiral arm seen in the h i maps of @xcite , beyond the southern limit of figure [ predict ] , is predicted to scatter light from as far north as 30 doradus , giving rise to faint diffuse light that is polarized at the 2030% level .",
    "it is expected that these models overpredict the mean levels of polarization because of the neglected contribution of direct light from field stars .",
    "using a monte carlo radiation transfer code , we have modelled the observed ultraviolet polarization maps of the lmc obtained with the wisp instrument .",
    "our code follows the tracks of stellar photons from their origins within ob associations , through a smoothly distributed exponential dust disk containing low - density cavities . by accounting for far - infrared thermal emission from heated dust ,",
    "we are able to parameterize the total amount of dust present by its optical depth .",
    "dust - scattered starlight gives rise to linear polarizations ; the magnitude and position angle of the polarization vectors allow us to derive information regarding the scattering geometry of stars@xmath0dust within the lmc and the optical properties of magellanic cloud dust .",
    "we consider three disk inclinations between 28@xmath3 and 45@xmath3 , and five values for the phase function asymmetry parameter @xmath1 , between 0.64 and 0.90 .",
    "we derive :    @xmath85 the inclination of the disk of the lmc to the plane of the sky is 36@xmath4 .",
    "this is in agreement with other results ( @xcite ) , but not with a recent kinematic determination ( @xcite ) .",
    "our determination contains a dependence on the dust scale height ; we have assumed @xmath32 = 200 pc , but smaller values would imply larger inclinations , and vice versa .",
    "@xmath85 the most likely value for @xmath1 of 0.70 ; the uncertainty in the observations does not permit us to rule out _ any _ value for @xmath1 .",
    "higher signal - to - noise data would sharpen our estimate , but a more precise method for estimating @xmath1 from our models is needed as well . for @xmath1 above 0.77 ,",
    "the models produce a higher fraction of highly polarized ( @xmath75 @xmath86 20% ) pixels than are observed .",
    "however , the neglect of direct light from field stars probably leads us to understimate @xmath1 .",
    "our value @xmath1 @xmath5 0.7 is consistent with values derived from ultraviolet surface photometry of the galactic reflection nebula ngc 7023 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath85 our best model predicts that scattered light from 30 doradus dominates the eastern side of the lmc s diffuse uv radiation field ; the presence of this `` mini - starburst '' region may be felt as far south as @xmath1472@xmath3 .",
    "data for this region would be of great value in constraining the lmc s structure and geometry .",
    "our models are the first attempt to replicate the observed images and polarization maps of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "it is encouraging that our model is able to approximately match the observations of paper i for a reasonable set of input parameters ; we do not expect that we have found a unique solution for i , @xmath1 , or the geometric parameters that go into the model .",
    "the modelling procedure should be applicable to more general problems in the interpretation of galaxy polarization maps .",
    "however , a large number of simplifying approximations and assumptions have been made .",
    "the most serious of these is the smoothness of the adopted model dust distribution .",
    "future work will be able to take into account the complexity of the lmc s h i distribution , which is dominated by flocculent spiral arms , supergiant shells , and small scale filaments ( @xcite ) .",

    "<S> motivated by new sounding - rocket wide - field polarimetric images of the large magellanic cloud ( @xcite ) , we have used a three - dimensional monte carlo radiation transfer code to investigate the escape of near - ultraviolet photons from young stellar associations embedded within a disk of dusty material ( i.e. , a galaxy ) . </S>",
    "<S> as photons propagate through the disk , they may be scattered or absorbed by dust . </S>",
    "<S> scattered photons are polarized and tracked until they escape to be observed ; absorbed photons heat the dust , which radiates isotropically in the far - infrared , where the galaxy is optically thin . </S>",
    "<S> the code produces four output images : near - uv and far - ir flux , and near - uv images in the linear stokes parameters q and u. from these images we construct simulated uv polarization maps of the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> we use these maps to place constraints on the star@xmath0dust geometry of the lmc and the optical properties of its dust grains . by tuning the model input parameters to produce maps that match the observed polarization maps , we derive information about the inclination of the lmc disk to the plane of the sky , and about the scattering phase function @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute a grid of models with @xmath2 = 28@xmath3 , 36@xmath3 , and 45@xmath3 , and @xmath1 = 0.64 , 0.70 , 0.77 , 0.83 , and 0.90 . </S>",
    "<S> the model which best reproduces the observed polarization maps has @xmath2 = 36@xmath4 and @xmath1 @xmath5 0.7 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the low signal - to - noise in the data , we can not place firm constraints on the value of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the highly inclined models do not match the observed centro - symmetric polarization patterns around bright ob associations , or the distribution of polarization values . </S>",
    "<S> our models approximately reproduce the observed ultraviolet photopolarimetry of the western side of the lmc ; however , the output images depend on many input parameters and are nonunique . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some of the limitations of the models and outline future steps to be taken ; our models make some predictions regarding the polarization properties of diffuse light across the rest of the lmc . </S>"
