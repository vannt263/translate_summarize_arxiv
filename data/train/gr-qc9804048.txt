    "the physical state of the neutron star matter has not been fully understood yet because it is very difficult to investigate particle interactions beyond nuclear matter density ( @xmath1 g @xmath2 ) either from nuclear experiments or from nuclear theories , ( here @xmath3 is the energy density of the nuclear matter and @xmath4 is the velocity of light ) .",
    "given this situation , one promising approach to explore the behavior of very high density matter is to make use of the macroscopic quantities of neutron stars . in particular , the mass and the rotational period of neutron stars depend crucially on the softness of the equation of state ( eos ) at very high densities ( see e.g. friedman et al .",
    "1984 , 1986 , 1989 ) , thus , observational constrains , matched with theoretical models , may help in reconstructing the equation of state of very high density matter .    given a particular equation of state , the mass of neutron stars varies with central energy density and always reaches a maximum .",
    "this implies that if the maximum mass of neutron star models constructed with a certain equation of state is smaller than the mass of observed neutron stars , that equation of state must be discarded .",
    "currently , the largest accurately measured mass of slowly rotating neutron stars is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of one of the components of the binary pulsar psr1913 + 16 ( taylor & weisberg @xcite ) and @xmath7 is one solar mass .",
    "individual masses of neutron stars have also been estimated in six other binary pulsars ( thorsett et al .",
    "@xcite , wolszczan @xcite ) , as well as in six x - ray binaries ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "@xcite ) but the accuracy is not as good as in psr1913 + 16 .",
    "thus , equations of state which give larger masses than @xmath6 for slowly rotating stars , can be valid as candidates for the real equation of state at very high densities .",
    "since the maximum mass of neutron stars is smaller for more compressible ( soft ) equations of state than for less compressible ( stiff ) equations of state , the true equation of state at high densities can not be extremely soft .",
    "on the other hand , stiff equations of state can be limited by considering the neutron star with the shortest rotational period , i.e. the most rapidly rotating pulsar .",
    "there exists a lower limit on the rotational period for each equation of state , because if the centrifugal force exceeds the self - gravity at the equatorial surface , no equilibrium states are allowed .",
    "the lower limit of the rotational period depends on the softness of the equation of state - the radius of neutron stars with softer equations of state is smaller , which allows for higher rotation rates .",
    "thus , if very rapidly rotating neutron stars should be found , we could exclude most stiff equations of state . at the moment ,",
    "the shortest period of observed pulsars is 1.56 ms , of psr1937 + 21 .",
    "consequently , equations of state for which the shortest rotational period is larger than this value , must be excluded as candidates for the real equation of state for neutron star matter .",
    "the discussions above require us to make use of highly accurate schemes for constructing rotating neutron star models , in order to compute precise theoretical values of masses and rotational periods .",
    "highly accurate relativistic equilibrium models are also needed as initial data for relativistic time - evolution codes ( modeling of nonlinear pulsations , collapse and generation of gravitational waves ) .",
    "recently , a number of groups have succeeded in constructing models of rapidly rotating neutron stars ( friedman et al .",
    "1984 , 1986 , 1988 , 1989 , eriguchi et al .",
    "@xcite , salgado et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , cook et al .",
    "@xcite , stergioulas & friedman @xcite  for a recent review see stergioulas @xcite ) . however , the obtained models by those authors do not always agree with each other ( see e.g. friedman et al .",
    "@xcite , eriguchi et al .",
    "@xcite , salgado et al .",
    "@xcite , cook et al .",
    "@xcite , stergioulas & friedman @xcite ) .",
    "although stergioulas & friedman  ( 1995 ) have determined the cause of the discrepancy between models in friedman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and eriguchi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , ( which was due to the use of a slightly different equation of state table ) , the reasons of smaller differences which remain , even after using exactly the same equation of state , have not been clarified yet .",
    "this is because numerical techniques used in the different codes , such as the choice of parameters defining the model , the interpolation method , the method of integrating the field equations , a.s.o .",
    "are not the same .    in this paper , three groups using their own codes ( komatsu et al .",
    "@xcite , eriguchi et al .",
    "@xcite , salgado et al .",
    "@xcite , stergioulas & friedman @xcite ) will decrease the differences between their results to a minimum possible , by tuning each code and using the same parameters , the same schemes of interpolation , the same equations of state , and so on . since the basic schemes used by the three groups are different",
    ", it will be impossible to have exactly the same results and the relative differences between results are a measure of the accuracy of the codes .",
    "models obtained with small relative differences between the three codes can be considered as  standard \" models for each equation of state .",
    "furthermore , this direct comparison allows us to investigate the effect that the choice of interpolation method , equation of state and domain of integration has on the accuracy of the codes .",
    "if rapidly rotating neutron stars were nonaxisymmetric , they would emit gravitational waves in a very short time scale and settle down to axisymmetric configurations .",
    "moreover , the gravity of typical neutron star is strong because @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass and the radius of a typical neutron star .",
    "therefore , we need to solve for rotating and axisymmetric configurations in the framework of general relativity .    for the matter and the spacetime we make the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the matter distribution and the spacetime are axisymmetric .",
    "2 .   the matter and the spacetime are in a stationary state .",
    "the matter has no meridional motions .",
    "the only motion of the matter is a circular one that is represented by the angular velocity .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath12 is constant , as seen by a distant observer at rest .",
    "the matter can be described as a perfect fluid .    under these assumptions",
    ", the metric can be expressed as follows ( papapetrou 1966 , carter 1969 ) : @xmath13 [ metric ] where @xmath14 is the time coordinate and the polar coordinates @xmath15 are used .",
    "the metric depends on four metric functions ( or metric potentials ) which are functions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 only .",
    "different authors have used the set of functions @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 , which are related to each other through ( [ metric ] ) . in ( [ metric ] ) and throughout the text we use gravitational units ( @xmath21 ) , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath22 is expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the energy density , the pressure and the four - velocity , respectively . in the coordinate basis defined by ( [ metric ] )",
    ", the components of the four - velocity are @xmath27 where the proper velocity @xmath28 with respect to a local zero angular momentum observer is defined by @xmath29 using the metric and the energy momentum tensor mentioned above , we can write down the einstein equations for the metric components . although we omit detailed expressions for the einstein equations here , one can easily derive them by straightforward calculations or consult the papers by butterworth & ipser  ( 1976 ) , komatsu et al .",
    "( 1989a ) and bonazzola et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "the equation of hydrostationary equilibrium can be derived from the equations of motion and takes the following form : @xmath30 this equation can be integrated , if we specify the equation of state which relates the energy density to the pressure . for a given eos , a model is uniquely specified by fixing two parameters , such as the central energy density @xmath31 and the ratio of the polar to the equatorial coordinate radius , @xmath32 .",
    "then , four einstein field equations and the equation of hydrostationary equilibrium must be solved with appropriate boundary conditions , to yield the four metric functions and the density distribution .",
    "the available codes for obtaining relativistic rotating neutron star models differ basically in the choice and method of integration of the four field equations and in the finite grid and finite difference scheme used for the integration .",
    "we will compare three different codes , which follow the keh scheme , developed by komatsu , eriguchi and hachisu  ( 1989a , 1989b ) for general relativistic polytropes with uniform and differential rotation and improved by cook , shapiro & teukolsky  ( 1992 , 1994a , b ) and the bgsm scheme due to bonazzola , gourgoulhon , salgado & marck  ( 1993 ) .",
    "concering the keh scheme , for the present comparison , we will use the original keh code , keh(or ) , and the keh code by stergioulas & friedman  ( 1995 ) , keh(sf ) , which follows the cook , shapiro & teukolsky  ( 1992 , 1994a , b ) modification of the keh scheme .      in this section",
    "the three different numerical codes are briefly described .",
    "details of these codes can be found in komatsu et al .",
    "( 1989a , 1989b ) and in eriguchi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for the keh(or ) code , in stergioulas & friedman  ( 1995 ) for the keh(sf ) code and in bonazzola et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for the bgsm code .",
    "komatsu et al .",
    "( 1989a ) have developed a new scheme for solving rapidly rotating relativistic stars .",
    "the einstein equations for three metric potentials @xmath33 and @xmath34 are transformed into integral equations by using appropriate green s functions for the elliptical type differential operators . in principle",
    ", one can choose green s functions which decrease as @xmath35 or more rapidly at large distances .",
    "consequently boundary conditions at infinity , i.e. asymptotically flat conditions can be easily included in the integral equations .",
    "it is noted that in this integral representation the integrand contains the metric and the matter quantities such as the energy density and the pressure .",
    "the fourth metric @xmath36 obeys a first order partial differential equation which can be easily integrated , if the other metric potentials are known .",
    "the domain of integration is truncated at a finite distance from the star ( roughly twice the equatorial radius ) and the metric potentials in the integrands are assumed to vanish at that finite distance ( instead of at infinity ) .",
    "the keh scheme is the extended version of the self - consistent - field ( scf ) scheme which was developed for solving newtonian rotating stars ( ostriker & mark @xcite , hachisu @xcite ) and applied to relativistic rotating stars by bonazzola & schneider ( 1974 ) with a choice of metric functions different from that of the codes considered in this article . in the scf method , the iteration proceeds as follows .",
    "if one assumes initial guesses for the matter quantities and the metric potentials , new ( and better ) values for @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be obtained using the integral representations for the metric potentials the fourth metric potential @xmath36 can be easily solved as mentioned before . by using newly obtained metric potentials , a new density and a new pressure can be computed from the hydrostationary equilibrium equation ( [ hydrost ] ) .",
    "one needs to repeat the same procedure until the relative differences between the newly obtained quantities and the old ones become less than a certain small number , typically @xmath37 .    in the original keh code ,",
    "the ratio of the central pressure ( @xmath38 ) to the central energy density ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 and the ratio of the polar radius ( @xmath41 ) to the equatorial radius ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 , are chosen as two independent model parameters which specify the model uniquely .",
    "the keh(or ) code used in this comparison differs from the code used in komatsu et al .",
    "( 1989a ) only in one aspect , that is mentioned in the next section .",
    "the keh(sf ) code ( stergioulas & friedman , 1995 ) differs from the original keh scheme in two ways .",
    "first , it follows cook et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in using a redefined radial variable @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the value of the coordinate @xmath16 at the equator .",
    "by this transformation , the region @xmath46 $ ] in the @xmath16 coordinate is transformed to the region @xmath47 $ ] in the @xmath48 coordinate . consequently",
    ", the domain of integration of the field equations does not have to be truncated at a finite distance from the star ( as in the keh(or ) code ) but covers all space . with this choice",
    ", the boundary conditions can be applied accurately at infinity .",
    "second , stergioulas & friedman found that the choice of coordinates in the original keh scheme results in the metric potential @xmath36 oscillating in the radial direction .",
    "the oscillation is especially pronounced inside the star and introduces an error of 1 - 2 % in the mass , radius and other quantities .",
    "the problem was fixed by using a finite difference formula for the second order radial derivative that uses twice the grid - spacing . although this formula is , in principle , of lower accuracy , the oscillations are damped completely , resulting in a more accurate stellar model .",
    "the keh(or ) code used in this comparison has been modified so as to use the same second order derivative formula as stergioulas & friedman , to smooth out the oscillations in the metric potential @xmath36 .",
    "bonazzola et al .  (",
    "1993 ) have developed a new formulation based on the @xmath49 formalism which has been used in hydrodynamics in general relativity .",
    "their choice of slicing and gauge in the @xmath49 formalism results in the same form of the metric usually chosen for stationary problems , i.e. ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "consequently the einstein equations are reduced to the same differential equations of elliptic type as used by other schemes .",
    "the main part of the bgsm formulation is similar to that of the keh formulation , except for the metric coefficient @xmath50 for which a second - order ( elliptic ) equation is used instead of a first - order equation in keh .",
    "the einstein equations are reorganized so as to  pick \" out the laplacian operators in two and three dimensional flat spaces and regard all other remaining terms as  source terms \" in the poisson - like equations in two and three dimensional flat spaces .",
    "concerning the matter , essentially the same equation as ( [ hydrost ] ) is used for the hydrostationary equation .",
    "the characteristic features of the bgsm code can be found in the numerical solving method , i.e. the pseudo - spectral method ( gottlieb & orszag 1977 , bonazzola et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 , 1998b ) . in the spectral method",
    "all functions are expanded in terms of certain base functions and algebraic equations for coefficients which appear in the expansion are solved .",
    "therefore there are two distinct procedures in this method : one is obtaining coefficients from the functions and the other is constructing functions by using the coefficients . since these two steps need to be , in general , performed many times , it is highly desirable to use a fast algorithm . in the spectral method of the bgsm code ,",
    "bonazzola et al .  (",
    "1993 ) have adopted trigonometric functions for the angle variable and the chebyshev polynomials for the radial variable .",
    "consequently for the angle part of any function , the fast fourier transform ( fft ) can be employed . concerning the radial variable , a new variable which is related to the radial variable by a simple equation",
    "is introduced so that the chebyshev polynomials are expressed by the trigonometric functions .",
    "after this transformation , one can use the fft also for the radial variable .",
    "the bgsm code can handle the region extended to infinity as is done by the keh(sf ) code .",
    "this can be performed by introducing a new radial variable @xmath51 as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the maximum value of the stellar radius .",
    "the boundary conditions at infinity , are easily applied at @xmath54 .",
    "it may be fair to note that in the newtonian rotating star problems a similar expansion was used by ostriker and mark  ( 1968 ) in the scf method , although ostriker and mark used the integral form of the newtonian potential instead of solving the poisson equation directly and they did not use the fft .",
    "here we summarize similarities and difference between the three codes :    \\a ) common features through all three codes :    1 .",
    "quasi - isotropic coordinates are used .",
    "it implies that the metric components are essentially the same , although background views deriving the metric are not the same .",
    "integral form of the hydrostationary equation for the matter is used .",
    "3 .   poisson - like operators are  picked \" out from the einstein equations and the other terms are treated as  source terms \" .",
    "\\b ) the keh(or ) code differs from the other two codes in that the boundary conditions are not applied at infinity , but approximate boundary conditions are applied at a finite distance from the star .",
    "\\c ) a difference between the bgsm code and the other codes is the use of a second - order ( elliptic)equation for @xmath55 in bgsm versus a first - order equation for @xmath56 in keh .",
    "we reorganized our codes so as to make the differences as small as possible .",
    "the codes agree exactly on :    1 .",
    "the physical model parameters by which we can specify a model uniquely , 2 .",
    "the values of physical constants , and 3 .   the equation of state of matter .",
    "since the three codes use different grids and/or numerical methods for solving the field equations , there will always be a residual difference in the results , even after this reorganization .",
    "this residual difference is what we want to determine .",
    "values used in this paper for the velocity of light @xmath4 , the gravitational constant @xmath9 , the mass of the sun @xmath7 and the baryon mass @xmath57 are as follows : @xmath58 note that some of the above constants differ slightly from the ones used in the papers where the three codes were first presented .      for realistic equations of state ,",
    "the energy density , pressure and other thermodynamical quantities are given in tables .",
    "intermediate values need to be obtained by a method of interpolation .",
    "we will use two different interpolation schemes , the four - point lagrange interpolation ( hereafter li ) and the cubic hermite interpolation ( hi ) ( swesty 1996 ) :    \\a ) lagrange interpolation    let us assume that there is a table which relates the variable @xmath59 to the variable @xmath60 at @xmath61 points , i.e. a set of values @xmath62 for @xmath63 are tabulated . for the li scheme",
    "the interpolated formula @xmath64 can be expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 the prime denotes the differentiation with respect to the argument .",
    "this scheme does not guarantee the values of derivatives at the points in the table .",
    "in this paper we use the four point lagrange interpolation , i.e. @xmath67 .    \\b ) hermite interpolation    in the hermite interpolation , the interpolated formula @xmath68 for @xmath69 is expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 here @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the cubic hermite functions defined by @xmath74 it is noted that these cubic hermite functions are unique polynomials of degree three satisfying the following relations : @xmath75 contrary to the li , in the hermite interpolation the values as well as their first derivatives at mesh points are exactly reproduced by the interpolation formula .",
    "the main advantage of the hermite interpolation is that it preserves the thermodynamical consistency ( swesty 1996 ) .",
    "we use the following relation as a polytropic equation of state ( tooper @xcite ) : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the polytropic constant and polytropic index , respectively , while @xmath79 is the rest mass density .",
    "it should be noted that this equation of state includes the limiting case of @xmath80 , when @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the constant density models are also called homogeneous models . for polytropes of index @xmath83",
    ", the density does not go to zero smoothly at the surface and the first derivatives of the density across the surface are discontinuous .",
    "this kind of discontinuity may become the cause of unfavorable behavior of solutions , unless it is treated carefully . for constant density models ,",
    "the situation is even worse , since the density itself is discontinuous across the surface .",
    "although polytropic eoss are not as realistic as tabulated eoss ( but one can reproduce neutron star bulk properties with an @xmath84 polytrope ) , they are helpful to check numerical codes . since the hydrostationary equation can be analytically integrated and no additional numerical errors arise in solving it .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the main uncertainties about neutron star properties are related to the unknown interactions of the neutron star matter at high density regions . in the last decades",
    ", many equations of state have been proposed by considering different kinds of interactions into account .",
    "a large collection of representative equations of state were compiled by arnett & bowers  ( 1977 ) , who constructed nonrotating neutron star models and obtained physical quantities for slowly rotating neutron stars .",
    "we will choose three equations of state of arnett & bowers compilation , i.e. equations c , g and l according to their notation .",
    "equations c , g and l are those derived by bethe & johnson  ( 1974 ) , canuto & chitre  ( 1974 ) and pandharipande & smith  ( 1975 ) ( see also pandharipande et al .",

    ", we see that the agreement between the keh(or ) and bgsm codes is similar to the agreement between keh(sf ) and bgsm in the global quantities of model n15@xmath110 but to within @xmath121 for the local quantities of this model . for the stiffer polytrope n05@xmath110 the agreement is @xmath121 and @xmath122 for global and local quantities , respectively .",
    "this difference in accuracy between keh(sf ) and keh(or ) is expected , since in keh(or ) boundary conditions are applied only approximately at a finite distance from the star . considering how close to the star the domain of integration is truncated",
    ", the keh(or ) code performs very well .",
    "this is explained as follows :    since the integration is performed over only a finite region , the truncated part of the integral , @xmath123 , can be expressed as @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath9 are the source term and the green s function , respectively , and the subscript @xmath126 denotes that the integration covers the region with @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath128 is the maximum radius of the region of integration .",
    "although the source terms of the integrals for the metric potentials in the keh(or ) scheme contain both matter and the metric terms , only the metric terms contribute to the integral the outside of the star .",
    "since we impose asymptotically flat conditions for the metric potentials , the radial dependence of the source term can be considered to be @xmath129 where @xmath130 , because of the behavior of metric functions at large radii .",
    "consequently , @xmath123 can be roughly expressed as @xmath131 from the above equation , we can see the following : first , for the stellar interior , i.e. @xmath132 , @xmath133 , so that the relative error @xmath134 can be very small where @xmath135 is the exact value of the integral .",
    "second , for the outer region of the stars , i.e. @xmath136 , the value of @xmath123 becomes larger for larger values of @xmath16 because of the logarithmic term .",
    "third , for the same region , i.e. @xmath136 , if the source term depends weakly on the radial coordinate , i.e. , for smaller values of @xmath137 , the contribution of the truncated part becomes larger .",
    "this occurs for the potentials @xmath138 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , for the metric functions @xmath139 and @xmath55 , since values of @xmath137 are large , the relative differences are rather small .    in the extreme case of constant density models ( tables  [ t : det_const1 ] and [ t : det_const2 ] ) , the three codes agree on the computed physical quantities typically only within a few percent and this is caused by the sharp density discontinuity at the surface of the star .",
    "the numerical schemes in this comparison assume that the density distribution is a smooth function of coordinates , thus , in the case of density discontinuities , this assumption is violated and gibbs phenomena appear , resulting in low accuracy of the computed models .    from tables",
    "[ t : det_real1][t : det_real3 ] it follows that the agreement of the keh(sf ) code to the bgsm code is between @xmath121 and @xmath119 for realistic eoss , except for eos cles , where the agreement is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "keh(or ) and bgsm agree on the realistic models within @xmath122 and @xmath121 , i.e. similar to the agreement for the @xmath140 polytrope .",
    "the somewhat lesser agreement for realistic eoss is due to the use of interpolation between the tabulated equation of state data ( see the discussion next ) .    in tables",
    "[ t : det_poly1 ] to [ t : det_real3 ] , we also display the virial quantities grv2 and grv3 .",
    "in the ideal case , these should exactly vanish , so the smaller the values for grv2 and grv3 are , the better is the accuracy of the computed model .",
    "the opposite is not always true , i.e. in some models the computed values for grv2 or grv3 do not reflect an overall better agreement in physical quantities among the different codes .",
    "this indicates that the computation of grv2 and grv3 may itself be prone to numerical error .",
    "this seems to be the case for grv2 in rapidly rotating models computed with the keh(sf ) code , where one first has to interpolate data between @xmath141 and @xmath17 grids to be able to compute grv2 .",
    "note that the displayed values of the two virial quantities for the keh(or ) code correspond to the modified virial identities ( [ grv2_mod ] ) and ( [ grv3_mod ] ) and not to the original identities .",
    "the computation of grv3 for the keh(or ) code is affected significantly by the truncation of the domain of integration .",
    "as redshift factors differ by about 10 % for the constant density , relativistic model n00@xmath113 between the three codes ( while the agreement global quantities is within a few % ) we compare directly the local values of metric potentials for several models .",
    "figures 1 to 16 show the four metric potentials ( upper panel ) and the relative differences in them between bgsm and keh(or ) ( middle panel ) and keh(sf ) and bgsm ( lower panel ) for the models n05@xmath110 , n15@xmath110 , l(l)@xmath110 and wff(fps)@xmath114 .",
    "the metric potentials are graphed against the coordinate @xmath16 in the equatorial plane ( @xmath142 , solid line ) and along the axis of rotation ( @xmath143 , dashed line ) .",
    "the range of the coordinate @xmath16 is the twice the equatorial radius of the star .    in general",
    ", the agreement in the local values of the metric potentials reflects the agreement in the computed physical parameters of models . in these graphs ,",
    "several significant behaviors can be pointed out : first , there are high frequency and small amplitude oscillations at the inner part of the stars for all models .",
    "second , the differences between the results of keh(or ) and those of the other two codes are growing outside the stars as @xmath16 increases .",
    "third , although the differences between the keh(sf ) and bgsm codes are very small for models n05@xmath110 , n15@xmath110 and wff(fps)@xmath114 , there appear larger differences for the stiff model l(l)@xmath110 .",
    "fourth , there appears a larger amplitude oscillation in the metric potential @xmath34 on the axis of rotation , close to the surface .",
    "the first behavior is due to the integration scheme of the keh code , i.e. the simpson scheme . in general",
    ", the simpson scheme gives results with higher precision , compared with those obtained by the trapezoidal scheme .",
    "however , in the keh scheme , the integrands contain nonsmooth functions with respect to the radial coordinate , because of the nature of the green s functions .",
    "the non - uniform distribution of the weight factor in simpson s scheme for nonsmooth functions results in oscillating behaviors with very small amplitudes , which can not be noticed in the behavior the integrated quantities .",
    "the large differences in the metric potentials between keh(sf ) and bgsm for eos l , could be accounted to the stiffness of the equation of state , but the differences between keh(or ) and bgsm for the same model are not as large , and we have not an explanation for that .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath34 on the axis of rotation near the surface are present also for the soft @xmath144 polytropes , while for @xmath140 they are larger .",
    "this indicates that terms in the field equations for @xmath34 are very sensitive to the presence of the surface and the accompanying gibbs phenomenon . even for @xmath144 polytropes , where the density goes to zero smoothly at the surface",
    ", there is a small scale gibbs phenomenon , due to the finite number of grid points used to represent the region of integration .",
    "an important factor for the local accuracy of models constructed with realistic equations of state is the method of interpolation of the energy vs. pressure data given in an eos table .",
    "while global quantities are not affected significantly , the virial identities for realistic eoss , are sensitive to the interpolation scheme this can be considered to reflect the nature of the interpolation scheme as mentioned before . if we define the enthalpy ( @xmath145 ) by @xmath146 the gibbs - duhem relation , which follows directly from the first law of thermodynamics , implies @xmath147 in the cubic hermite interpolation , the gibbs - duhem relation is used to replace by @xmath148 the term @xmath149 which appears in the hydrostationary equilibrium equation .",
    "if the tabulated function @xmath150 fails to satisfy the above relation , then the hydrostationary equilibrium equation , which is derived from the bianchi identity , is only approximately verified by the numerical solution , which results in increased error in the grv2 and grv3 virial identities .",
    "the four point lagrange interpolation does not satisfy the gibbs - duhem relation because it only reproduces the values of the discrete points , but there is no guarantee for the reproduction of the derivatives .",
    "this explains why the grv2 and grv3 errors are bad , even in the nonrotating case ( grv2 = 3e-03 , grv3 = 1e-02 for model l@xmath112 ) as compared to @xmath151 for polytropic models ( see e.g. bonazzola et al .",
    "the grv2 and grv3 error indicators thus do not reflect the precision of the code but the bad thermodynamical behavior of the tabulated eos .",
    "the advantage of the cubic hermite interpolation is that the gibbs - duhem relation is automatically satisfied because this interpolation reproduces not only the values themselves but also the derivatives ( swesty 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , in our case , the energy density and the baryon number density are obtained by @xmath152 because of these equations , the gibbs - duhem relation is satisfied in every point .",
    "note also that the value of @xmath24 obtained in this way coincides exactly with @xmath153 at the points in the tabulated equation of state .",
    "the comparison of three different codes for constructing rapidly rotating relativistic neutron star models demonstrates that the bgsm and keh schemes used are highly accurate for typical polytropic models - when the field equations are solved to infinity - and for models constructed with realistic equations of state , that do not have phase transitions .",
    "if one approximates neutron stars as constant density stars , then gibbs phenomena at the discontinuous surface reduce the accuracy of the computed models . if high accuracy in such models and in models with phase transitions is desired , then modified numerical schemes - free of gibbs phenomena - need to be used .",
    "such numerical schemes could employ , for example , surface fitted coordinates .",
    "such a scheme has been presented recently by bonazzola et al .",
    "( 1998a ) in the framework of spectral methods and looks promising for rotating stellar models .",
    "further , we demonstrated that the metric potentials are subject to various local oscillatory behaviors , even if integrated quantities have very good accuracy .",
    "this observation is important for the effort of constructing initial data for the numerical evolution of rotating relativistic neutron star models .",
    "we would like to thank s. bonazzola and j. l. friedman for very helpful discussions .",
    "this research has been supported in part by nsf grant phy-9507740 and by the grant - in - aid for scientific research of the japanese ministry of education , science and culture .",
    "wishes to acknowledge the generous hospitality of the max planck institute for gravitational physics , potsdam , where part of this paper was completed .",
