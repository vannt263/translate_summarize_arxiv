    "<S> we show an @xmath0 @xmath1 protocol which is based on the protocol showed by kim bostrom and timo felbinger [ phys . </S>",
    "<S> rev . lett . 89 , 187902 ( 2002 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our protocol is asymptotically secure key distribution and quasisecure direct communication using a mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol can be carried out with great efficiency and speed with today s technology , e.g. single photon source and linear optical elements technology .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 03.67.hk , 03.65.-a    quantum key distribution is a brilliant application of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that quantum channel is secure because quantum physics establishes a set of negative rules stating things that can not be done : ( 1 ) one can not take a measurement without perturbing the system . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) one can not determine simultaneously the position and the momentum of a particle with arbitrarily high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) one can not simultaneously measure the polarization of a photon in the vertical - horizontal basis and simultaneously in the diagonal basis . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) one can not draw pictures of individual quantum processes . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) one can not duplicate an unknown quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> these characters of quantum physics let us have ability to exchange information securely . </S>",
    "<S> the motive that we build quantum - mechanical communications channels is not only to transmit information securely without being eavesdropped on but also to transmit information more efficiently .    in the bennett - brassard ( bb84 ) protocol [ 1 ] , alice send a key qubit to bob , which is prepared in one of two conjugate bases . </S>",
    "<S> bob measures the qubit in one of the two base . </S>",
    "<S> the eavesdropper eve does not know the basis choose by alice , so she can not obtain information about the key without a detectable disturbance . but </S>",
    "<S> this type of cryptographic schemes are usually non@xmath2er@xmath3istic [ 2,3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> a secure direct communication has been presented in reference [ 4 ] , which allows encoding only after a final transmission of classical information . </S>",
    "<S> recently , k. bostrom and t. felbinger presented a @xmath4 @xmath5 , which allows for deterministic communication using entanglement [ 5 ] . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will give an improved @xmath1 @xmath6 using single photon in the mixed states .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that we can prepare a photon in states @xmath7 or @xmath8 in its polarization degree of freedom , where @xmath9 , it can be obtained : @xmath10 and @xmath11 suppose alice want to obtain some classical information . </S>",
    "<S> first she sends a photon which is prepared in a mixed states @xmath12@xmath13 to bob . </S>",
    "<S> that is , alice selects state @xmath14 or @xmath15 randomly with the probability @xmath16 every time . </S>",
    "<S> bob decides either to perform the operation @xmath17 on the travel qubit to encode the information 1 or do nothing , i.e. , to perform the operation @xmath18 to encode the information 0. then bob sends the travel qubit back to alice . </S>",
    "<S> alice performs a measurement on this back photon to draw the information bob encoded . </S>",
    "<S> this is a @xmath1 protocol [ 5 ] . in this protocol , there are two communication modes , @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath20 ( see figs.1 and 2 . ) . by default , bob and alice </S>",
    "<S> are in message mode . </S>",
    "<S> the communication is described above . with probability @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> , bob switches the message mode to control mode . </S>",
    "<S> after bob obtained a photon , instead of performing his operation on the travel qubit , bob use the public channel to exchanges information about the basis alice used . </S>",
    "<S> then bob performs a measurement in the basis @xmath23 or @xmath24 decided by the information alice told . </S>",
    "<S> bob sends the measurement result to alice . </S>",
    "<S> if alice find the result is the same as she prepared , she let the communication continue . </S>",
    "<S> else , there is an eve in line </S>",
    "<S> . the communication stops ! </S>",
    "<S> this protocol can be described explicitly like this :    \\1 ) alice prepares a photon in the state @xmath14 or @xmath25 with a probability @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 ) alice sends the photon to bob .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 ) bob receives the travel photon . </S>",
    "<S> he decides to the message mode or the control mode randomly .    </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) @xmath26 @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> bob exchanges two bits information with alice through public channel . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the photon was prepared in state @xmath14 , but bob finds that the measurement result is in the state @xmath27 ( or alice prepared the photon in the state @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> however , bob finds the photon in the state @xmath28 ) . there is an eve in line </S>",
    "<S> . the communication stops . </S>",
    "<S> else , this communication continues ( goto 1 ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> .    4 m ) @xmath29 @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> bob performs an operation to encode classical information on the photon . </S>",
    "<S> he encodes the information 0 by the operation @xmath30 , and the information 1 by the operation @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> then bob sends the photon back to alice . </S>",
    "<S> alice obtains the classical information encoded by bob with a measurement in the basis it has been prepared . </S>",
    "<S> this communication continues ( goto 1 ) . ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\5 ) when all of bob s information transmitted , this communication stops .    </S>",
    "<S> we will show that this protocol is secure below .    </S>",
    "<S> eve is an evil quantum physicist able to build all devices that are allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> her aim is to find out which operation alice performs ( see fig.3 . ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we will show that eve can not get full information about the states @xmath31 that alice prepared . here </S>",
    "<S> we will use a very famous theorem , the holevo theorem [ 6,7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it states that : suppose alice prepares a state @xmath32 where @xmath33 with a probabilities @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> eve performs a measurement described by povm elements @xmath35 on the state , with measurement outcome e. the holevo theorem states that for any such measurement eve may do : @xmath36 where @xmath37 s(@xmath38 ) is the von neumann entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the mutual information h(a : e ) of a and e measures how much information a and e have in common . </S>",
    "<S> it is a good measure of how much information has been gained about a ( alice ) from the measurement outcome e ( eve ) . </S>",
    "<S> we denote @xmath39 the holevo chi quantity is the upper bound on the accessible information . </S>",
    "<S> we will prove that @xmath40 where h(a ) is shannon entropy as a function of a probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the binary entropy h(a ) is [ 8 ] : @xmath41 since either of the mixed states is prepared with equal probability @xmath42 , then we have @xmath43 the upper bound on the accessible information eve can gain about the mixed states is @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the von neumann entropy is defined by [ 8 ] @xmath45 the matrix of the density operator in the basis @xmath7 is @xmath46 .\\ ] ] we can calculate the eigenvalues @xmath47 of @xmath38 : @xmath48 then von neumann s definition of entropy ( 10 ) can be re - expressed @xmath49 and the von neumann entropy is zero for a pure state . </S>",
    "<S> so we have @xmath50 which means the law of quantum mechanics forbids eve to gain full information about the states @xmath38 which alice prepared . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , eve is not sure which state alice prepared .    to find out which operation bob performs </S>",
    "<S> , eve would use all methods that quantum mechanics laws allowed . </S>",
    "<S> the most general quantum operation is a completely positive map @xmath51 because of the stinespring dilation theorem [ 9 ] , and completely positive map can be realized by a unitary operation on a larger hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath52 has a hilbert space of @xmath53 dimensions , then it suffices to model the ancilla space @xmath54 as being in a hilbert space of no more than @xmath55 dimensions . with an ancilla state @xmath56 , and a unitary operation @xmath57 on @xmath58 , for all @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath60.\\ ] ] in order to gain information about bob s operation , eve should first perform the unitary attack operation @xmath57 on the composed system , then let bob perform his coding operation on the travel photon , and finally perform a measurement . </S>",
    "<S> no measurement implies that eve did not get any information about the travel photon .    </S>",
    "<S> because the photon is in mixed states , to eve , the travel photon is prepared in a state either @xmath14 or @xmath25 with a probability @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> first , let us suppose the travel photon is in the state @xmath25 . because eve s purpose is to find out which operation bob performs , she adds an ancilla in the state @xmath62 and performs the unitary operation @xmath57 on both systems , resulting in latexmath:[\\[|\\psi ^{\\prime } > = u|\\varphi _ { 0},e>=\\alpha |\\varphi _ { 0},e_{0}>+\\beta    ancilla states uniquely determined by @xmath57 , and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> randomly , bob selects the control mode and turns on the public channel . if eve does not exist , the result of bob s measurement will always in the state @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> with eve in line , the detection probability for eve s attack in a @xmath21 @xmath20 is @xmath65 without @xmath21 @xmath20 , after eve s attack operation , the state of the system becomes @xmath66 which can be written in the orthogonal basis @xmath67 @xmath68 .\\ ] ] bob encodes his one bit by applying the operation @xmath18 or @xmath17 to the travel photon with the respective probability @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the state of the qubit photon becomes @xmath71 .\\ ] ] the maximal information eve can gain is decided by the von neumann entropy , @xmath72 , described by eq.(12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can calculate the eigenvalues @xmath47 of @xmath73 : @xmath74}.\\ ] ] when @xmath75 , the maximal information eve can gain is surprising equal to the shannon entry of a binary channel , @xmath76 which is concavity for any @xmath53 range 0 to 1 [ 8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath77 has a maximum at @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a monotonous function @xmath79 , @xmath80 $ ] . when the information eve gains @xmath81 , the detection probability is @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> if eve want to gain full information about bob s operation , the detection probability is @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> assume that alice sends state @xmath14 rather than @xmath25 , the same result we can gain [ 5 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose the probability of @xmath21 @xmath20 in every protocol run is @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective transmission rate is @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic probability after @xmath85 bits transmitted that eve is not detected becomes @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 . with the communication running , eve s successful detection probability decreases exponentially .    </S>",
    "<S> summary , in this paper , we give an improved @xmath1 @xmath5 . comparing with the @xmath1 protocol showed by bostrom and felbinger [ 5 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we use a single photon source instead of an epr pair source . </S>",
    "<S> a stable and efficient single photon source has been reported [ 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> knill , laflamme , and milburn have shown that quantum logical operation can be performed using linear optical elements and ancilla photons [ 11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this secure communication protocol can be carried out with great efficiency and speed using today s technology .    </S>",
