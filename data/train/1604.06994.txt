    "the main objective of this paper is to construct a @xmath0-valued spectral flow for paths of skew - adjoint fredholms on a real hilbert space . our justification for using the term `",
    "spectral flow ' for the spectral invariant defined here is that it satisfies the three properties that can be used to axiomatize @xcite the spectral flow for the self - adjoint fredholm operators on a complex hilbert space @xcite , namely :    \\(i ) normalisation , ( ii ) concatenation , ( iii ) homotopy invariance .    in section  [ sec - finitedim",
    "] this will first be achieved for spectral flow along straight line paths in finite dimensions .",
    "the correct definition simply counts the number of orientation changes of the eigenfunctions at eigenvalue crossings at @xmath1 modulo @xmath2 .",
    "hence the @xmath0-spectral flow is _ not _ of purely spectral nature , but also depends on the eigenfunctions , as explained on a particularly simple example in section  [ sec - finitedim ] . for the extension to fredholm operators",
    "we then follow in section  [ sec - def ] the analytic approach to the complex spectral flow for paths of self - adjoint fredholm operators on a complex hilbert space as described in @xcite , namely a partitioning argument is used allowing to restrict to the finite dimensional case . in the complex case , this circumvents considerable technical difficulties linked to the topologists intersection number approach ( _ e.g. _ @xcite based on @xcite ) and leads to computable formulas @xcite . in the present context it allows to show relatively directly that the @xmath0-valued spectral flow can be calculated , similarly to the complex spectral flow @xcite , as a sum of index type contributions ( section  [ sec - alternativeform ] ) , provided the appropriate notion of index is used .",
    "this turns out to be the mod 2 \" index map on a subgroup of the orthogonal group which was introduced in @xcite and is reviewed in section  [ sec - prelimortho ] .",
    "finally an index formula is proved in section  [ sec - index ] which connects the @xmath0-valued spectral flow of certain paths in the skew - adjoint operators on a real hilbert space to the @xmath0-index of an associated toeplitz operator on the complexification .",
    "all of this is illustrated in section  [ sec - ex ] by an explicit example given by a matrix - valued shift operator which can be considered to be the analogue in real hilbert space of the standard toeplitz operator in the complex case .",
    "this example can be viewed as the canonical non - trivial example of @xmath0-valued spectral flow .",
    "next , let us place the @xmath0-valued spectral flow into the perspective of the work of atiyah and singer @xcite on the classifying spaces for real @xmath3-theory .",
    "one of these spaces is the set @xmath4 of skew - adjoint fredholm operators on a separable real hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "its homotopy groups are known to be @xmath6-periodic and given by @xmath7 the two components of @xmath4 , that is @xmath8 , can be read off the parity of the kernel dimension ( see @xcite and section  [ sec - prelim ] below ) .",
    "one of the contribution of this paper is to show that @xmath9 is detected by the @xmath0-valued spectral flow , which actually provides an explicit isomorphism ( see section  [ sec - index ] ) .",
    "we do not attempt here , however , to obtain topological formulas for the @xmath0-valued spectral flow using real analogues of the atiyah - singer index theorem . to our knowledge",
    "this is an unresolved problem .",
    "furthermore , we do not study @xmath10 as a spectral flow here .",
    "let us also note that several of the results below can be rewritten using clifford valued indices as described in section  iii.10 of @xcite , but this will not be spelled out in any detail .",
    "while this paper focuses on the mathematical questions addressed above , our motivation comes from the use of real @xmath3-theory in mathematical physics .",
    "we present two examples of applications , both to the theory of topological insulators .",
    "the interested reader should see section  [ sec - topins ] for details . in this context",
    "the importance of a real spectral flow has recently been highlighted @xcite .",
    "let us point out that another notion of @xmath0-spectral flow more closely linked to the complex spectral flow under a particular symmetry condition was investigated in @xcite .",
    "this is not connected to the one studied in the present paper .",
    "this section defines the @xmath0-valued spectral flow associated to a linear ( or straight line ) path @xmath11\\mapsto t_t=(1-t)t_0+t\\,t_1 $ ] of skew - adjoint operators on a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 . as a motivation ,",
    "let us begin with @xmath12 and consider two paths , one linear and a second non - analytic path @xmath11\\mapsto \\tilde t_t$ ] of skew - adjoint matrices : @xmath13 the spectra of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as complex operators are @xmath16 with @xmath17 so that both eigenvalues form a crossing with a double degenerate kernel at @xmath18 , and the associated complex spectral flow ( in any possible sense , _",
    "e.g. _ of @xcite ) vanishes . nevertheless , there is a difference between the two paths .",
    "in fact , for @xmath15 , one can consider the homotopy @xmath19\\mapsto \\tilde t_t(s)$ ] of paths of skew - adjoints given by @xmath20 then @xmath21 , while @xmath22 is a constant path with spectrum @xmath23 which is actually the straight - line path between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "consequently the spectral crossing of the path @xmath15 can be homotopically lifted . on the other hand",
    ", it is impossible to lift the kernel of @xmath14 .",
    "this defect is encoded in the eigenfunctions as follows .",
    "viewing @xmath26 and @xmath27 as non - degenerate skew - symmetric bilinear forms , results from linear algebra imply that there exists a real invertible matrix @xmath28 such that @xmath29 actually , here @xmath30 which exchanges the eigenvectors of the upper and lower branch of @xmath14 at @xmath18 .",
    "this is reflected by the sign of @xmath31 and this sign is by definition the @xmath0-valued spectral flow @xmath32 between the points @xmath26 and @xmath27 along the straight line path .",
    "this actually is true also for the complex spectral flow @xcite ( which is simply equal to the difference of the signatures of the end points ) .",
    "let us stress again that due to the above , this @xmath0-valued spectral flow is _ not _ only determined by the spectrum of the path , but rather depends on the eigenfunctions as well .",
    "however , we will show further below that a path having vanishing kernel throughout necessarily has a trivial @xmath0-valued spectral flow .",
    "another important difference between the two cases in is that @xmath14 is analytic in @xmath33 , while @xmath15 is not ( this will be elaborated upon further down ) .",
    "after these words of motivation , we can go on to the formal definition of the @xmath0-spectral flow .",

    "we will construct two examples of non - trivial @xmath0-valued spectral flow in one - dimensional bdg hamiltonians .",
    "one is linked to a flux tube argument allowing us to describe zero modes attached to a defect in the model , the other to a cycle used for orbital polarization .",
    "the infinite and ` clean ' ( meaning no disorder ) kitaev chain is described by a hamiltonian on @xmath418 given by @xmath479 here @xmath159 denotes the right shift and @xmath480 is a chemical potential .",

    "consequently , in the usual symmetry classification scheme @xcite , this model lies in the class bdi .",
    "as it also has an induced ` chiral symmetry ' given by the composition of the phs and trs , it has a well - defined @xmath491-index @xcite .",
    "this reduces to a @xmath0 index if the trs is broken and the system then only lies in the class d @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0 index is equal to the number of zero modes ( majorana states ) that a half - space restriction of the model has , taken modulo @xmath2 .",
    "all these facts are stable under perturbations by disorder , as long as the stated symmetries hold . for sake of simplicity",

    "a magnetic flux @xmath493 will be inserted in the cell between @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",

    "finally ( ix ) results from the fact that both @xmath529 and @xmath530 have exactly one majorana boundary state for @xmath534 , see section  3.6.1 of @xcite .",

    "but @xmath544 for some finite range @xmath545 , see , and on the other hand @xmath546 for another finite range @xmath547 .",

    ", it remains to show @xmath194\\mapsto h(t))=1 $ ] . for all @xmath534 ,",
    "the zero energy @xmath1 lies in a gap of @xmath548 and @xmath549 .",
    "hence there is no @xmath0-spectral flow when @xmath550 is homotopically deformed to @xmath551 , so that it is sufficient to consider this case . but for @xmath551 , one can check starting from that @xmath552 . by proposition  [ prop - listprop ] and",
    "the gauge transformation one also concludes @xmath553 .",
    "therefore the real skew - adjoints associated to the majorana representation are actually complex structures , so that one can invoke proposition  [ prop - basicsf ] to calculate @xmath194\\mapsto h(t))={{\\rm sf}}_2(h_0,h_1)$ ] using proposition  [ prop - listprop](ix ) .",
    "@xmath47    the main application will concern the spectral properties at @xmath554 .",
    "this is particularly interesting because the hamiltonian at @xmath554 has the even trs @xmath555 .",
    "it thus lies in the same universality class bdi as the kitaev model , and is , in fact , obtained from the latter model by the perturbation of a local defect at the sites @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "the following result shows that this defect necessarily has zero modes attached to it . as @xmath556 for all @xmath557",
    ", these zero modes are always evenly degenerate .      * proof . *",
    "the symmetry property @xmath526 proposition  [ prop - listprop](vii ) combined with the last claim of theorem  [ theo - welldef ] shows that for any @xmath560 such that @xmath561 has minimal kernel dimension , @xmath562\\mapsto h_\\alpha ) \\;=\\ ; { { \\rm sf}}_2(\\alpha\\in[1-\\alpha_0,1]\\mapsto h_\\alpha ) \\;.\\ ] ] hence from the concatenation property @xmath542\\mapsto h_\\alpha ) \\;=\\ ; { { \\rm sf}}_2(\\alpha\\in[\\alpha_0,1-\\alpha_0]\\mapsto h_\\alpha ) \\;.\\ ] ] as @xmath563 is analytic in @xmath557 , one can conclude that at @xmath554 there is an odd number of eigenvalue crossings by proposition  [ prop - fluxflow ] .",
    "@xmath47    finally , let us comment on adding disorder or other perturbations to the hamiltonian : @xmath564 here @xmath309 is a possibly random perturbation representing disorder in the system but having the bdg and trs symmetries @xmath565 and @xmath566 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath269 is chosen to be sufficiently small such that the gap in the essential spectrum of @xmath548 does not close .",
    "this essentially imposes that @xmath567 for some suitable constant depending on the norm of @xmath309 .",
    "now all statements proved above directly transpose to @xmath568 , in particular , also theorem  [ theo - defect ] .",
    "this short last section indicates that there are further natural instances where the @xmath0-valued spectral flow appears .",
    "it is based on several prior results which are only briefly described and the reader is urged to read up in the cited references .",
    "let us begin by recalling from @xcite the connection between polarization and spectral flow of half - sided operators based on the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "we restrict to dimension @xmath39 , even though this connection holds in any dimension .",
    "suppose given a smooth loop @xmath569 of periodic hamiltonians on @xmath570 .",

    "actually , the polarization @xmath574 is defined as the accumulated charge during one loop and then the above is the so - called king - smith - vanderbilt formula which holds in the adiabatic limit as proved in @xcite .",
    "the second important fact for the following is that @xmath574 is @xmath575 times an integer called the chern number @xmath576 where @xmath577 . again",
    "this chern number is also given as the index of a certain fredholm operator @xcite .",
    "next let us consider the restrictions @xmath578 of @xmath579 to @xmath580 , say , with dirichlet boundary conditions ( actually any local boundary condition will do ) . these operators may have bound states and it is proved in @xcite that the standard complex spectral flow of these eigenvalues through @xmath550 is equal to the chern number , namely @xmath581 based on these facts , we now construct an example of a bdg - hamiltonian with non - trivial @xmath0-valued spectral flow . on @xmath582 ,",
    "let us set @xmath583 where @xmath584 is a coupling constant and @xmath585 is a smooth loop of bounded bdg operators , namely @xmath586",
