    "cognitive technology is bound to change the way spectrum is accessed and used . cognitive power control with the conflicting goals of maximizing secondary users ( sus )",
    "throughput and minimizing interference to primary users ( pus ) is a key enabling technology for cognitive devices .",
    "feedback - based cognitive power control recently received attention in the cognitive literature ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite , for instance , the authors suggest an on - off su power control scheme based on observing the automatic repeat request ( arq ) feedback from primary receiver which reflects pu achieved packet rate .",
    "the key difference between our work and others is that we assume a temporally correlated channel between the primary transmitter and receiver .",
    "based on primary channel state information ( csi ) feedback , a cognitive transmitter can exploit the correlation to predict the primary link gain during the next transmission phase .",
    "the cognitive power is adjusted accordingly so that the secondary throughput is maximized and the primary link outage probability is kept below a certain maximum . in section [ sec : sim_results ] we compare the performance of our algorithm with the one proposed in @xcite where no knowledge of the channel statistics is assumed .",
    "we show via simulations that , under channel correlation assumptions , our model garners better performance out of the arqs .",
    "the system model and assumptions are described in section [ sec : sysmdl ] . in section [ sec : const_optim ] , we pose the cognitive power optimization problem and solve it optimally under delayed csi .",
    "we formulate the cognitive power control problem as a maximization of the weighted sum of the primary and secondary throughput under various csi in section [ sec : outage_prob ] .",
    "section [ sec : sim_results ] presents the numerical results .",
    "our work is concluded in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider a pair of primary and secondary users as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdl ] .",
    "the secondary pair is composed of the secondary transmitter ( st ) and secondary receiver ( sr ) .",
    "the secondary pair attempts to share the spectrum resource with the primary link , composed of the primary transmitter ( pt ) and primary receiver ( pr ) .",
    "the goal of the secondary terminals is to maximize their throughput , via the choice of st transmit power , provided that the primary system outage probability is kept below a maximum value , @xmath0 .",
    "the pt transmits all the time with a constant power @xmath1 , and a constant rate @xmath2 , both known to the secondary transmitter .",
    "we ignore the interference from pt on sr .",
    "we also assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are known to the secondary transmitter , and constant .",
    "hence , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where t is the time index .",
    "the st overhears the primary link - layer csi feedback from pr to pt , assumed to be transmitted over an error - free control channel .",
    "we consider two types of csi availability in this paper : delayed and 1-bit arq - csi . in delayed csi feedback",
    ", pr is assumed to send to pt a perfect unquantized estimate of the primary channel gain experienced by the last packet .",
    "hence , we also refer to this type of transmitted feedback as causal genie cg - csi .",
    "the primary link channel follows a block - fading markov channel model where the channel complex gain varies from packet to packet according to the following first order autoregressive equation :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a zero - mean unit - variance circularly symmetric complex gaussian innovation process , and @xmath9 $ ] determines the channel correlation .",
    "note that @xmath10 corresponds to i.i.d .",
    "gains , and @xmath11 corresponds to a time invariant gain .",
    "the channel gain at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , is independent of @xmath8 and is also a zero - mean unit - variance circularly symmetric complex gaussian process .",
    "this makes the process @xmath14 stationary with a unit - variance rayleigh - distributed magnitude .    in the sequel , we let @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the noise variances at the primary and secondary receivers , respectively . to distinguish the primary link channel gain over which the csi is fed back ,",
    "we let @xmath19 . for the cg - csi",
    ", @xmath20 is made available .",
    "we denote the arq - csi as @xmath21 , where the hat symbol denotes vectors , @xmath22 $ ] is a vector of arq - csi feedback and the secondary power policy @xmath23 $ ] is a vector of previous st transmit power decisions . for the arq - csi ,",
    "we assume an explicit feedback model where @xmath24 for packet @xmath25 is @xmath26 for correct reception , and @xmath27 for erroneous reception . channel update model similar to the primary link model used in ( [ eq : primary_channel ] ) and include a training phase to learn @xmath4 . ]",
    "the cognitive power control problem can be posed as a constrained optimization problem as follows :    @xmath28\\\\ \\quad\\\\ s.t.\\quad&\\lim_{l\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{1}{l}\\sum^{l}_{i=1}\\left[\\mathbb{e}_{\\hat{d}_{i-1}}{\\int_{0}^{\\gamma^{th}}{f(\\gamma_{i}|(\\hat{d}_{i-1}))d\\gamma_{i}}}\\right]\\leq p_{out},\\\\ \\quad\\\\ & 0\\leq p^{s}(\\hat{d}_{i-1})\\leq p_{max } \\label{eq : constrained } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is a generic vector of csi available at time @xmath30 ( e.g. , @xmath31 under arq - csi ) , and @xmath32 is the secondary power value at time @xmath30 given the csi at time @xmath33 .",
    "the primary link experiences outage when @xmath34 .",
    "outage is assumed to occur when @xmath35 exceeds the primary link capacity .",
    "assuming gaussian signaling , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath36 as :    @xmath37    the objective above denotes the secondary link expected throughput .",
    "the first constraint is the expected outage probability of the primary link , whereas the second constraint sets a lower bound of zero on @xmath32 and an upper bound of @xmath38 .",
    "the expectation operator is over the available csi at time @xmath30 , @xmath29 .",
    "it is required to find the optimal secondary power vector @xmath39 $ ] that maximizes ( [ eq : constrained ] ) , where the asterisk denotes optimality .",
    "we now consider the solution of this problem under the two types of available csi .      under cg - csi , solving ( [ eq : constrained ] ) is equivalent to solving :    @xmath40\\\\ \\quad\\\\ s.t.\\quad & \\mathbb{e}_{\\gamma_{t-1}}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\gamma^{th}}{f(\\gamma_{t}|\\gamma_{t-1})d\\gamma_{t}}\\right]\\leq p_{out},\\\\ \\quad\\\\ & 0\\leq p^{s}(\\gamma_{t-1})\\leq p_{max } \\label{eq : constrained_cg } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is evaluated using ( [ eq : threshold_gamma ] ) with @xmath41 .",
    "the summation in ( [ eq : constrained ] ) is eliminated in ( [ eq : constrained_cg ] ) because the optimal power control policy is greedy under cg - csi @xcite . since the optimal future power assignments @xmath42",
    "are chosen based on perfect knowledge of delayed channel gains , they do not depend on @xmath43 rendering optimal the greedy formulation in ( [ eq : constrained_cg ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ eq : constrained_cg ] ) is a non - convex problem to which we present a numerical solution in section [ sec : sim_results ] .      in the case of arq - csi ,",
    "the optimal cognitive power control assignment at a given instant conditioned on the degraded feedback is a partially observable markov decision process ( pomdp ) @xcite . since",
    "the transmitted power at a given instant influences the arq - csi feedback received in the future , the optimal power at any instant depends on the optimal power at subsequent instances .",
    "hence , solving ( [ eq : constrained ] ) is intractable under arq - csi . in order to reduce the computational complexity of the solution in the case of arq - csi",
    ", we present a reformulation of the constrained optimization problem in the next section .",
    "this new formulation makes the arq - csi power control problem amenable to online implementation .",
    "in this section , we pose the cognitive power control problem as the maximization of the weighted sum of primary and secondary throughput .",
    "moreover , we replace the expectation over csi with time averaging and consider the maximization of the instantaneous weighted sum throughput .      for illustration purposes ,",
    "we first apply the weighted sum formulation to the relatively - easier case of cg - csi which is later used to upper - bound the performance under arq - csi .",
    "the instantaneous weighted sum throughput @xmath44 is given by :    @xmath45 \\label{eq : thru } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 $ ] is a weighting parameter that reflects the relative importance of the primary and secondary throughput .",
    "with the proper choice of @xmath47 , maximizing the weighted sum implicitly enforces the target outage probability for the primary link @xcite .",
    "the goal is to find the optimal @xmath48 value that maximizes ( [ eq : thru ] ) , where @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "we calculate the average throughput as :    @xmath50    where k is the number of instants over which the @xmath51 is calculated .",
    "the outage probability varies according to : ( a ) the value of the primary link channel gain experienced by a packet and ( b ) the secondary power level @xmath43 . from the channel model given in ( [ eq : primary_channel ] ) ,",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the pdf of @xmath52 conditioned on the delayed - csi is :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the first order modified bessel function .",
    "we now summarize the steps used to calculate the average sum throughput under cg - csi :    1 .   using ( [ eq : recursive ] ) , calculate the conditional outage probability corresponding to a certain @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   at each time instant ,",
    "find the optimal @xmath56 value that maximizes the instantaneous weighted sum throughput using ( [ eq : thru ] ) .",
    "the average throughput @xmath57 is obtained from ( [ eq : csi_arq3 ] ) .",
    "the maximization of the weighted sum is a scalarization technique of the constrained optimization problem described in the previous section .",
    "the optimal pair @xmath58 obtained from ( [ eq : thru ] ) are pareto - optimal solutions for the constrained optimization problem . however , for some non - convex problems , the scalarization technique does not return all the pareto - optimal points @xcite . in other words , solving the constrained optimization problem is more general than solving ( [ eq : thru ] ) .      in this section",
    "we would like to replace the non - degraded cg - csi with the 1-bit degraded arq - csi feedback . as described previously ,",
    "the optimal ack - csi policy is a pomdp process .",
    "therefore , when the instantaneous throughput is used , the optimal power @xmath59 is given by :    @xmath60 } \\label{eq : csi } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 $ ] , and @xmath62 is evaluated as in ( [ eq : thru ] ) using the arq - csi .",
    "note that ( [ eq : csi ] ) is prohibitive to solve .",
    "inspired by the optimal cg - csi scheme , we implement a greedy scheme to maximize the weighted sum throughput as follows :    @xmath63    note that we now removed the asterisk with the implementation of the greedy scheme .the average throughput is obtained from ( [ eq : csi_arq3 ] ) using the arq - csi , where we replace @xmath59 with the outcome of the greedy arq algorithm , i.e. @xmath64 .",
    "to calculate the outage probability , we derive the pdf @xmath65 . following a similar derivation to @xcite ,",
    "we write : @xmath66    where in ( [ eq : original ] ) , we make use of the markovian property . note that we also restored @xmath67 to its basic definition in section [ sec : sysmdl ] . using ( [ eq : recursive ] ) , we re - write the second part of equation ( [ eq : original ] ) using bayes rule as :    @xmath68    note that , @xmath69    equation ( [ eq : bayessplit ] ) follows from the fact that the ack / nack for a given time instant @xmath70 is only a function of the primary channel gain at time @xmath70 and the secondary transmitter power at @xmath70 , @xmath71 . based on our assumption",
    "that error occurs when the transmission rate exceeds the capacity , we get the following values for the conditional probability @xmath72 :    @xmath73    @xmath74    where @xmath36 is evaluated using ( [ eq : threshold_gamma ] ) with @xmath75 .",
    "note also in ( [ eq : bayes ] ) that :    @xmath76    hence , ( [ eq : bayes ] ) becomes :    @xmath77    by incorporating ( [ eq : bayes1_final ] ) in ( [ eq : original ] ) , we have reached a recursive formula for the calculation of the primary channel gain given the history of past arq and the secondary transmitter power decisions .",
    "we now summarize the steps for obtaining the greedy @xmath78 :    1 .   start from a randomly generated primary channel realization .",
    "2 .   initialize the pdf @xmath79 with the exponential prior .",
    "3 .   calculate the pdf @xmath80 from equation ( [ eq : recursive ] ) .",
    "4 .   once a packet is transmitted , and the acknowledgment is received , calculate @xmath81 .",
    "5 .   obtain @xmath82 from ( [ eq : bayes1_final ] ) and use it in ( [ eq : original ] ) to update @xmath83 .",
    "use @xmath83 to find the @xmath64 value that maximizes ( [ eq : csi_arq ] ) .",
    "save the throughput attained under this @xmath64 value , @xmath62 .",
    "update the channel gain using ( [ eq : primary_channel ] ) and repeat from step 4 .",
    "the average arq - csi throughput , @xmath78 is obtained by averaging the achieved throughput over time , using ( [ eq : csi_arq3 ] ) . a fundamental question remains as to how close is this greedy approach to the optimal ack power control algorithm , @xmath84 .",
    "following a similar argument to @xcite , a policy given cg - csi can always choose not to use this additional csi and yet achieve optimal ack - csi throughput @xmath84 . using the cg - csi optimally",
    "can only achieve the same or greater throughput , hence @xmath85 . in section",
    "[ sec : sim_results ] , we show via simulations that the average throughput attained greedily under the arq - csi is close to that attained under cg - csi , and by the reasoning above , the optimal arq - csi policy lies somewhere in between .",

    "the primary link is with high probability in natural outage , hence st uses maximum power , while as the @xmath20 value increases , st adjusts the power accordingly to make use of the capacity gap . at large values of @xmath20 ,",
    "albeit occuring with small probability , st transmits with maximum power without fear of putting the primary link in outage . the expected throughput attained by averaging over the exponential distribution of @xmath20",
