    "it has been studied years ago that the supersymmetric generalizations of the bosonic cp(n-1 ) sigma model is automatically an @xmath2 supersymmetric theory by the virtue of that the target space cp(n-1 ) is a khler manifold @xcite .",
    "recently edalati and tong suggested and built an @xmath3 cp(n-1 ) heterotic sigma model by study of the low - energy dynamics of vortex strings in @xmath4 four - dimensional gauge theories@xcite .",
    "later shifman and yung formulated a geometric representation for this heterotic model with the cp(n-1 ) target space for bosonic fields and an extra right - handed fermion which couples to the fermion fields of the @xmath5 cp(n-1 ) model@xcite , and thus breaks the supersymmetry to @xmath3 .    in this paper , we follow the geometric formulation to discuss the fermionic zero modes of @xmath3 heterotic cp(1 ) sigma model in the instanton background .",
    "nontrivial homotopy group structure of target space cp(1 ) allows for the bosonic instanton background of the form of a holomorphic function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are instanton size and center respectively . under such background",
    ", the fermionic zero modes can be obtained by acting supercharges and superconformal charges to the instanton solution . since the heterotic deformation of the standard cp(1 ) sigma model only preserves half of four original supercharges , the supersymmetries and superconformal symmetries are partly broken .",
    "the remaining fermionic generators are not sufficient to generate all fermionic zero modes from the instanton background .",
    "therefore we will find zero modes by solving dirac equations . in section 2",
    ", we will calculate the chiral anomaly at first to give the number of zero modes . in section 3",
    "we will explicitly solve dirac equations of zero modes and use the result of section 2 to pick up those linear independent modes . in the last section we generalize this result to cp(n-1 ) heterotic sigma models .",
    "we start from the chiral anomaly of the standard cp(1 ) sigma model .",
    "the notations are in accordance with the reference @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of cp(1 ) is given as follows : @xmath9\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{2}{g_{0}^2\\chi^2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi^{\\dagger}\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi+\\frac{2i}{g_{0}^2}\\bar{\\xi}\\gamma^{\\mu}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\xi - ia_{\\mu}\\xi)+\\frac{2}{g_{0}^2}(\\bar{\\xi}\\xi)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for convenience to calculate the chiral anomaly .",
    "it has a chiral symmetry and thus an axial current : @xmath13 the chiral anomaly is well - known@xcite as : @xmath14 this anomaly term corresponds to the tadpole diagram : +     now we are going to consider the chiral anomaly of heterotic cp(1 ) sigma model .",
    "the lagrangian of the heterotic model for bilinear fermion terms is deformed from eq.(1 ) by adding terms with an extra right - handed fermion field @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "since only bilinear terms of fermions need to be considered when calculating one loop diagrams , we just write them up : @xmath16 + \\frac{2i}{g_{0}^2\\chi^2}\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi-\\frac{2}{\\chi}\\phi^{\\dagger}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\psi)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & i\\bar{\\zeta}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\frac{1+\\gamma_5}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\zeta+(\\bar{\\zeta}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\frac{1+\\gamma_5}{2}b_{\\mu}\\xi+h.c.)+ \\frac{2i}{g_{0}^2}\\bar{\\xi}\\gamma^{\\mu}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\xi - ia_{\\mu}\\xi)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath17 and @xmath18 . it is easy to see @xmath19 and the lagrangian is invariant under @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ". therefore the corresponding axial current is : @xmath22    we will show that the chiral anomaly of the heterotic model will not be corrected by the extra @xmath23 terms , and thus prove that the number of zero modes is the same as the standard cp(1 ) model . actually , to calculate this anomaly one needs to consider diagrams as follows : +   + the diagrams b and c cancel with each other because both of them are finite , and thus free to shift integral variables .",
    "the diagrams d and e also cancel each other",
    ". it can be proved by using momentum @xmath24 times the sum of these two diagrams , @xmath25 +   + by multiplying @xmath26 , the original converged digrams d and e become two divergent parts respectively .",
    "however they are all logarithmically divergent , and thus still free to shift integral variables to prove the cancellation .",
    "therefore the anomaly of heterotic case is still only from the tadpole diagram , and is the same as in the standard cp(1 ) case , see equation ( 3 ) .",
    "for the standard cp(1 ) model , @xmath27 has four zero modes , under the instanton background @xmath28@xcite .",
    "since the chiral anomaly is not corrected in the heterotic case , the number of zero modes should be still four .",
    "we now proceed to derive the dirac equations for @xmath27 and @xmath23 from the heterotic lagrangian and wick - rotate them to euclidean space by @xmath29 .",
    "we only keep linear terms in the equations of motion and solve them .",
    "we will see that the solutions are also satisfied with the equations of motion when we add nonlinear terms . since we have already shown that the number of independent zero modes is four , the solutions solved in the equations of motions up to linear terms are all zero modes . from eq .",
    "( 4 ) and instanton background @xmath30 , in spinor components we have : @xmath31 notice that eqs .",
    "( 8) ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) are the same as in the standard cp(1 ) case",
    ". therefore the solutions to these three equations should be the same as before .",
    "they give all four zero modes .",
    "since we have argued that the total number of zero modes is four , there is no extra zero modes raised from field @xmath32 , although the equation of motion of @xmath32  ( 10 ) is deformed by the @xmath33 term .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath34 by the same argument , fermionic field @xmath23 and @xmath35 can not provide extra zero modes . from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) , we get : @xmath36 at first sight , the solutions seem inconsistent with the anomaly calculation , which gives the number of the difference between left and right handed fermions under instanton background , @xmath25 @xmath37 from solutions ( 12)-(15 ) , it seems that the first two solutions are right handed fermions while the last two are left handed , thus the number of the difference is zero .",
    "however , because we wick - rotated to euclidean space to perform the calculation , in which the complex conjugate is not a well - defined involution for chiral fermions , the field @xmath38 is thus totally independent of @xmath27 .",
    "moreover in euclidean space , the lagrangian is @xmath39 invariant .",
    "therefore the field @xmath38 transformed under @xmath39 is the same as @xmath40 .",
    "bearing this in mind , we can be back to the lagrangian ( 4 ) : @xmath41 now it is clear that , when wick - rotated to euclidean space , the field @xmath42 and @xmath43 we solved in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) are in fact the fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , while the field @xmath38 plays the same role as @xmath40 in euclidean space . therefore the four solutions are all right handed fermions .",
    "it is consistent with the anomaly calculation .    as for the field @xmath23 , solution",
    "( 16 ) shows that the extra field @xmath23 mixes with field @xmath27 , however it is linearly dependent of field @xmath27 , and thus does not produce extra zero modes as what we also expected from the result of the chiral anomaly calculation ( 17 ) .    at last ,",
    "one more worthy to mention is the solutions of field @xmath27 .",
    "they are of the same form as in the standard cp(1 ) zero modes .",
    "it means that not only the number of zero modes does not change , the zero modes of @xmath27 also receive no correction in the heterotic model .",
    "in fact it is easy to understand this result from equation ( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "although the supersymmetries are partly broken by deformation in the heterotic case , the classical equation of motion of @xmath27 up to linear terms are still @xmath1 supersymmetic invariant . therefore in this sense",
    "the zero modes of @xmath27 still can be generated by supercharges and superconformal charges from the instanton background , even though half of the symmetries are broken in the heterotic model .",
    "in addition , one can check that these solutions are satisfied with the equations of motion when adding nonlinear terms of fermions .",
    "our conclusion to the heterotic cp(1 ) model is that the zero modes of @xmath27 are the same as in the standard cp(1 ) case , while the extra fermion @xmath23 does not provide extra zero modes .",
    "this result can be simply generalized to the heterotic cp(n-1 ) model .",
    "for the heterotic cp(n-1 ) case , the lagrangian containing bilinear terms of fermions is@xcite :",
    "@xmath46 + ig_{i\\bar{j}}\\bar{\\psi}^{\\bar{j}}\\gamma^{\\mu}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi^{i}+\\gamma^{i}_{lk}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi^{l}\\psi^{k})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the equations of motion up to linear terms under instanton backgroud @xmath47 are : @xmath48 it is not hard to see the solutions are : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the khler potential . from these solutions",
    "we see that the number of zero modes in the heterotic cp(n-1 ) model is still @xmath51 , while @xmath23 can be linearly expressed by the zero modes of @xmath27 and thus not extra zero mode .",
