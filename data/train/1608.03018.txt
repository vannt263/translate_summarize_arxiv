    "exact solutions of strongly correlated hamiltonians are very specific and/or computationally expensive , therefore , it is often necessary to resort to approximate solutions . in order to provide a qualitative understanding , the approximations should recover basic physical features of the models .",
    "one of the most studied correlated hamiltonian is the anderson impurity model ( aim ) , originally proposed for the description of magnetic impurities in a conducting host @xcite , which manifests the kondo phenomenon at low enough temperatures @xcite . within the approximated schemes ,",
    "the non- and one - crossing approximations ( nca , oca ) have an important place in the literature @xcite .",
    "its uses are not only restricted to impurity models @xcite , but also have been extended to correlated lattice models in the context of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "the scopes and limitations of both approximations are well known through detailed analysis of the corresponding semi - analytical expressions of the green s functions , and also by comparison with exact techniques , like the bethe ansatz and the numerical renormalization group calculations @xcite . in particular , a lot of effort has been dedicated to the analysis of the fermi liquid properties of the aim when it is solved within nca and oca ; their successes and failures are quite well known and we refer the reader to the specific references @xcite . in brief",
    ", it has been argued that one of the underlying reasons for the incorrect description of the ground states properties within these approximations is their wrong predictions of the threshold exponents of the ionic states @xcite .    in this paper , we show that the nca solution of the one - channel spin-@xmath0 particle - hole symmetric anderson model yields the exact ionic threshold exponents at zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless , its results are qualitatively wrong at any temperature : this solution physically corresponds to the two - channel infinite-@xmath1 single level anderson model and , explicitly , we show that the nca is unable to distinguish between the two physical systems . in other words , we conclude that the correct threshold exponents are a necessary but not sufficient condition for fermi liquid behavior .    from a numerical analysis of the impurity contribution to the entropy",
    ", we exemplify that the nca solution does not correspond to the model at hand .",
    "surprisingly , the obtained solution is the one that arises from an overcompensated two - channel ( 2ch ) spin-@xmath0 anderson model .",
    "in fact , we obtain a finite residual entropy at very low temperatures , well below the kondo one @xmath4 being the extrapolated ground state value @xmath5 instead of zero expected for a fermi liquid ground state .",
    "this particular fractional value of the ground state degeneracy is known to correspond to the 2ch kondo model @xcite .",
    "although we illustrate the failure through the impurity entropy , we also provide clear evidences of how this qualitative wrong solution extends to any other thermodynamic property , at any temperature .",
    "furthermore , we prove that the nca results for the electrical conductance @xcite , when the symmetric aim is used to analyze transport properties through quantum dots , is the same as the expected conductance for the 2ch kondo model . on the other hand",
    ", we show that the next leading order in the self - consistent hybridization expansion , the oca scheme , lifts the artificial mapping between the models at the symmetric point , and gives a qualitative good prediction of the properties for the models at hand , with satisfactory quantitative improvements for large degeneracy of the impurity states .",
    "therefore , the present work is a warning for the potential users of such a simple approximation like nca , that can incorrectly map a given model into another .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , due to its simplicity , the nca in its finite-@xmath1 version is nowadays widely used @xcite .",

    "@xmath1 denotes the energy cost when the impurity is doubly occupied and we consider that this energy is the same for all the pairs of localized orbitals .",
    "the energies @xmath16 are the hybridization matrix elements between the impurity and delocalized electrons .",
    "the coupling of the impurity with the conduction band is encoded in the so - called hybridization function @xmath17 .    with respect to the impurity , we restrict its hilbert space to the states without electrons ( empty state ) , single occupied with only one electron in the orbital @xmath18 , and doubly occupied with two electrons in the orbitals @xmath18 and @xmath19 defining the atomic configurations @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the number of single and doubly occupied states are @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "therefore , the size of the impurity hilbert space is given by @xmath23 , which can be accessed through the evaluation of the impurity contribution to the entropy , at high enough temperatures .",
    "using a slave - boson and pseudo - fermion representation of the impurity states @xcite , @xmath24 , being @xmath25 the vacuum state without any impurity degree of freedom , the physical impurity operator can be expressed by @xmath26 . here",

    "are recovered by oca .",
    "the discussion presented here , the qualitative breakdown of nca for the particle - hole symmetric aim , becomes of general interest because , nowadays , nca is one of the most used impurity solver methods , due to its simplicity and straightforward extension to more complex situations .",
    "therefore , our work highlights the importance of vertex corrections , even for a qualitative description of anderson impurity models .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we mention that , probably , artifacts as the one we have found in this work could also be found when solving correlated models by non - crossing re - summations of diagrams in the evaluation of self - energies .",
    "these approaches , known under the generic name of self - consistent second born approximations , are widely used in the literature . in view of our results , a detail analysis of the inclusion of higher order diagrams may be done in order to test the reliability of the approximations .",
    "this work was partially supported by pip 00273 , pip 01060 and pip 112 - 201101 - 00832 of conicet , and pict r1776 and pict 2013 - 1045 of the anpcyt , argentina .",
    "_ numerical evaluation of the nca equations and entropy _",
    "+    in this appendix we give details of the calculation we have implemented in order to get an accurate solution of the nca equations at low temperatures , which is crucial for getting the lowest temperature values of the impurity entropy .",
    "as we have mentioned at the beginning of the numerical results section , we have closely followed the approach given by hettler , kroha , and hershfield in ref . for the computation of the impurity entropy @xmath48 .",
    "however , we have found a better accuracy for the solution of the nca selfconsistent equations , eq .",
    "( [ sistema_oca ] ) , through a different choice for the lagrangian parameter , @xmath169 , as we will describe in what follows .",
    "note that the whole set of physical properties of the model hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ anderson - auxiliary ] ) does not depend on the individual values of the pseudo particle energy levels , @xmath170 , but depend on their differences .",
    "consider , for instance , the physical spectral function for transitions between the vacuum and single occupied states , showed in eq .",
    "( [ rho_nca_simetrica ] )        this freedom in the definition of the pseudo particle energies derives , in fact , from a symmetry of the hamiltonian related with a gauge transformation of the auxiliary operators according to @xmath174 .",
    "we refer the reader to the appropriated references for a deep discussion of this issue @xcite .",
    "the numerical trick used by hettler and co - workers consists in the determination of @xmath169 , at each nca iteration , in such a way that the magnitude @xmath178 . with this important trick , the narrow peaks developed by the auxiliary spectral densities at the threshold energy moves towards , as the temperature decreases , to the fermi energy , usually fixed at @xmath179 .",
    "this allows the use of a dense grid of energy points around the zero frequency , with the consequent increment in resolution of such narrow peaks .",
    "the final parameter @xmath169 has the interpretation of the impurity contribution to the free energy , @xmath180 .",
    "+ in our work , we have made used of a different choice for the parameter @xmath169 . at the end of each nca / oca iteration",
    "we compute the following energies @xmath181 and fix @xmath182 . with this choice , the narrow peak corresponding to the lowest energy pseudo particle ( and also the coherent contribution of the excited ones ) is _ exactly _ located at the fermi energy @xmath179 for the next iteration . in our experience , we found that the present algorithm is even better than the previous one used by hettler _",
    "et al._. furthemore , the speed and stability of the calculation is improved due to the fact that there is no search for roots of non linear equations like @xmath183 . in our case ,",
    "the magnitude @xmath184 depends on temperature and therefore we can not identify the parameter @xmath169 as the free energy . instead of",
    "that , the free energy reads as follows @xmath185                by the name nca we mean to the approximation obtained by perform a self - consistent hybridization expansion in which the ionic self - energies are characterized by bubbles of second order in the hybridization strength independently of being @xmath1 finite or not .",
