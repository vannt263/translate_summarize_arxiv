    "magnetic field in solar wind plasma is actively studied in the last years both theoretically and experimentally ( see , for instance , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "properties of this field gradients are of especial interest because of strong non - homogeneity of the field .",
    "inferring universal properties of the magnetic field is a difficult task due to superposition of the strong non - homogeneity and global anisotropy . even in the inertial range of scales the non - homogeneity and anisotropy affect behavior of different components of the magnetic field and its gradients . it can be shown @xcite , however , that _ magnitude _ of the magnetic field @xmath1 does exhibit certain universal properties in inertial range of scales",
    "moreover , we will show in present paper that magnitude of _ gradients _ of the solar wind magnetic field exhibits certain universal properties as well .",
    "these universal properties have substantial geophysical consequences , which we discuss in the last section of the paper .",
    "+ in magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) the magnetic field fluctuation @xmath2 dynamics is described by equation @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the turbulence velocity and the @xmath5 is magnetic diffusivity . equation ( 1 ) can be regarded as a vector analogue of the advection - diffusion equation @xmath6 for the evolution of a passive scalar @xmath7 subject to molecular diffusivity @xmath8 . aside from the fact that @xmath9 is a vector and",
    "@xmath7 a scalar , the equations are different also because @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be affected quite readily by the feedback of the magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "our interest here is to explore the extent of similarities , despite these obvious differences , in the inertial ( batchelor ) range statistics of the magnetic and the passive scalar fields ( see , for instance , refs.@xcite-@xcite and the papers cited there ) .",
    "solar wind is an excellent natural  laboratory \" for the mhd problem .",
    "it is known that the statistical properties of velocity fluctuations in the solar wind are remarkably similar to those observed in fluid turbulence @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the plasma power spectra of the magnetic field and velocity fluctuations often contain an `` inertial '' range with a slope of approximately @xmath12 ( for reviews , see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the approximately @xmath12 power - law is especially common for magnitude fluctuations @xmath1 ( the summation over repeated indexes is assumed ) of the magnetic field , as one can see in fig .  1 . for computing this spectrum ,",
    "we have used the data obtained from advanced composition explorer ( ace ) satellite magnetometers for the year 1998 . in this period , the sun was quiet and the data are statistically stable .",
    "the range of scales for which the  @xmath12 \" power holds is taken to be the inertial range ; the smaller scales are obliterated because of the instrument resolution and the truncation at the large - scale end is governed by the record length chosen for fourier transforming .",
    "the nature of the spectrum for each individual component of the magnetic field is more variable from one component of @xmath11 to another , and from one situation to another , perhaps because of large anisotropies in the magnetic field @xmath11 , but the result for the @xmath13 of @xmath11 seems more robust . scaling spectrum with the @xmath12 slope ( fig .",
    "1 ) is quite typical of that observed for passive scalar fluctuations in fully developed three - dimensional fluid turbulence ( the so - called corrsin - obukhov spectrum @xcite ) .",
    "spurred by this similarity , we were motivated to explore further the properties of the magnitude @xmath14 and its gradients , and compare them with those of the passive scalar .",
    "more detailed statistical information is provided by the structure functions scaling @xmath15 where @xmath16 the exponent @xmath17 is directly related to the spectral exponent ( in our case @xmath18 @xcite ) . if the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath20 is nonlinear , it is well - known that one has to deal with intermittency .    figure 2 shows the scaling of structure functions for the solar wind data .",
    "slopes of the straight - line fits in the apparently scaling region provide us the scaling exponents @xmath19 ; these are shown in fig .  3 as circles .",
    "triangles in the figure indicate experimental values obtained for temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the other experimental data @xcite,@xcite are in agreement with each other to better than 5@xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 symbols are for the passive scalar field obtained by numerically solving the advection - diffusion in three - dimensional turbulence @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the exponents for the passive scalar data are in essential agreement with those for the _ magnitude _ fluctuations of the magnetic field .",
    "one can , in fact , analyze the solar wind data somewhat differently using the notion of the extended self - similarity ( ess ) . since , empirically , the fourth order exponent is quite closely equal to 1 for the magnetic field magnitude , i.e. , @xmath23 we can extend the scaling range ( and consequently improve the confidence with which those exponents are determined ) by redefining them as @xmath24    figure 4 shows the ess dependence ( 6 ) .",
    "the slopes of the best - fit straight lines in this figure provide us with the ess scaling exponents @xmath19 , which are shown in fig .  5 as circles .",
    "the other symbols have remained unchanged from fig .",
    "the shift of the exponents @xmath19 in comparison to those from ordinary self - similarity is about 4@xmath21 , but the scaling interval for ess is considerably larger .",
    "this increased scaling range is well - known in other contexts @xcite .",
    "the results shown in figs .",
    "3 and 5 suggest that at least up to the level of the fourth - order the scaling exponents for the passive scalars and for the magnitude of the magnetic field are essentially the same .",
    "this is both surprising and thought - provoking , and needs to be understood further . to this end , let us return to eq .",
    "( 1 ) and specialize @xcite , for simplicity , to the case of incompressible moving medium ( @xmath25 ) . equation ( 1 ) can then be rewritten as @xmath26 let us now consider the equation for the magnitude @xmath14 of the magnetic fluctuations given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the unit vector with its direction along @xmath9 : @xmath29 . multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( 7 ) by the vector @xmath30 and taking into account that @xmath31 we obtain @xmath32 in which the  friction - stretching \" ( or the production ) coefficient @xmath33 in the last term has the form @xmath34 with the indexes @xmath35 and @xmath36 representing the space coordinates , and the summation over repeated indexes is assumed .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 9 ) is crucial for any dynamo effect .    if the statistical behaviors of @xmath7 and @xmath14 are to be similar , as suggested by figs .  1 , 3 and 5",
    ", we should be able to observe the underlying similarity between eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 8) . there is a major difference corresponding the presence in eq .",
    "( 8) of the production term @xmath37 .",
    "however , given the empirical indications that @xmath14 and @xmath7 are similar in the inertial range , it is appropriate to look for circumstances under which the @xmath33 term in eq .",
    "( 8) may be small . the second term in @xmath33 is assured to be small because the smallness of the magnetic diffusivity @xmath5 , but difficulties may arise from the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 9 ) .    to eliminate _",
    "directional _ dependencies in eq .",
    "( 8) , let us make the following conditional average of that equation .",
    "that is , fix the magnitude @xmath14 in the vector field @xmath38 while performing the average over all realizations of the direction vector field @xmath30 permitted by the vector equation ( 7 ) .",
    "let us denote this ensemble average as @xmath39 . from the definition ,",
    "this averaging procedure does not affect @xmath14 itself , but affects the velocity field @xmath4 and the  friction - stretching \" coefficient @xmath33 in eq .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath40 it is worth emphasizing that the solutions of the original equation ( 7 ) satisfy eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 10 ) , but not all possible formal solutions of the eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 10 ) satisfy eq .",
    "( 7 ) ; similarly , not all formal solutions of eq .  ( 10 ) satisfy eq .",
    "( 8) while all solutions of eq .",
    "( 8) do satisfy eq .",
    "( 10 ) . restricting comments to the relationship between eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 10 ) , the solutions of the two equations are the same only if the initial conditions are the same and if realizations of @xmath41 and of @xmath42 , related to these initial conditions by the conditional average procedure , are obtained from solutions applicable to eq .",
    "( 8) .    returning now to eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the conditionally averaged velocity field @xmath43 may posses statistical properties that are different from those of the original velocity field @xmath4 , and there can be circumstances under which @xmath44 , or small .",
    "if so , the similarity between eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 10 ) ( and , consequently , eq.(8 ) ) can be the basis for the similarity in statistical properties of their solutions . therefore",
    ", finding conditions under which @xmath44 , or small , seems to be a useful exercise .",
    "it is , however , difficult to guess _ a  priori _",
    "when @xmath45 is negligible , because there is no small parameter for the stretching part of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , let us consider a generic set of conditions , presumably for the inertial range , which can result in @xmath46 .",
    "this can be a combination of isotropy , which yields @xmath47 and @xmath48 and statistical independence @xmath49 where @xmath50 for arbitrary @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we should emphasize that the conditional average indicated by @xmath53 and the global average indicated by @xmath54 are quite different ; because of this , the quantity @xmath14 in ( 10 ) remains a fluctuating variable . to eliminate the stretching part from the conditionally averaged coefficient @xmath55this being critical for explaining the observed similarity in the scaling of structure functions between @xmath14 and @xmath7one does not need to satisfy conditions ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) for all realizations of the magnetic field @xmath9 , but only for the subset of realizations that gives the main statistical contribution to the structure functions ( 3 ) .",
    "let us name this subset of realizations as _",
    "i_. the structure functions ( 3 ) depend on the statistical properties of the _ increments _ with respect to @xmath56 , namely @xmath57 , belonging to the inertial range of scales .",
    "one of the consequences of intermittency is that the statistical properties of the increments are essentially different from those of the field @xmath9 itself .",
    "therefore , the subset _",
    "i _ need not generally coincide with the subset _ g _ , say , that gives the main statistical contribution to the _ global _ average @xmath58 .",
    "this means , in particular , that the conditions ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) can be valid for the inertial interval ( i.e. for subset _ i _ ) , while globally ( i.e. for subset _ g _ ) these conditions could well be violated .",
    "we now use conditions ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) in the presence of the incompressibility condition @xmath59 and obtain @xmath60 that is , the difference between the passive scalar equation ( 2 ) and the conditionally averaged equation ( 10 ) for @xmath14 is reduced to pure  friction \" with the friction coefficient given by ( 13 ) .",
    "equation ( 10 ) can then be reduced in lagrangian variables to @xmath61 with the  multiplicative noise \" @xmath62 given by eq .",
    "weak diffusion of lagrangian  particles \" can be described as their wandering around the deterministic trajectories .",
    "introduction of a weak diffusion is equivalent to introduction of additional averaging in eq .",
    "( 14 ) over random trajectories @xcite .",
    "the small parameter @xmath5 in ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) will then determine a slow time in comparison with the time scales in the inertial interval and will therefore not affect scaling properties of @xmath14 in the inertial interval .",
    "this explains the similarity of scaling between @xmath14 and @xmath7 .",
    "if one can neglect the last term in the right - had side of the equation ( 10 ) in the inertial range , then one can readily derive equation for the magnitude gradients @xmath63 @xmath64 the magnitude @xmath65 of the gradient is determined by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the unit vector with its direction along vector @xmath68 .",
    "multiplying both sides of eq.(15 ) by @xmath69 , making summation over @xmath35 , and taking into account of the fact that @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 which is formally similar to eq .",
    "( 2 ) ( cf .",
    "( 8) ) except for the last term in ( 16 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath72 in this term has the form ( cf .",
    "( 9 ) ) @xmath73    one can see remarkable similarity to the situation described in previous section .",
    "this similarity suggests applying ensemble conditional average similar to that described above .",
    "fix the magnitude @xmath65 in the vector field @xmath74 while performing the average over all realizations of the direction vector field @xmath67 permitted by equation ( 15 ) .",
    "let us denote this ensemble average as @xmath75 . from the definition ,",
    "this averaging procedure does not affect @xmath65 itself , but modifies the velocity field @xmath43 , which in turn modifies the coefficient @xmath72 in eq .",
    ". we may write @xmath76    the further analysis can be performed precisely as it has been done above for magnitude of magnetic filed itself .",
    "two main consequences of the directional average : isotropization and smoothing of the velocity field @xmath43 and the `` nullification '' of the production term in the conditionally averaged equations , can have different proportions in these two cases .",
    "for the above considered case with magnitude of magnetic field the conditionally averaged ( on the directions of the magnetic field ) velocity was still enough strongly fluctuating to belong to the inertial range paradigm .",
    "it is possible , however , that the conditional average on the directions of the magnitude _ gradients _ can smooth the already smoothed velocity field @xmath43 to a substantially non - fluctuating state . in the last case",
    "the essential point is that the twice conditionally averaged velocity @xmath77 is smoothed substantially in comparison with @xmath4 , while the fluctuation of @xmath65 itself is still rapid in the diffusion - advection equation ( 18 ) ( because it remains in tact under the conditional average , by virtue of its definition ) . under these typical circumstances , the natural expectation ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) is that the space autocorrelation function can be characterized by a logarithmic behavior @xcite given by @xmath78 the result owes itself to the pioneering work of batchelor @xcite , @xcite who applied this general idea to the viscous - convection range of passive scalar fluctuations with large @xmath79 . while the two contexts are quite different , they are the same in the sense that the velocity field is smooth whereas the advected quantity is strongly fluctuating .    for turbulent flows the taylor hypothesis",
    "is generally used to interpret the data .",
    "this hypothesis states that the intrinsic time dependence of the magnetic field can be ignored when the turbulence is convected past the probes at nearly constant speed . with this hypothesis",
    ", the temporal dynamics should reflect the spatial one @xcite .",
    "equation ( 19 ) can be rewritten in the temporal terms ( @xmath80 @xmath81 ) @xmath82    this is seen from figs . 6 and 7 ( in the semi - log scales ) to apply quite precisely for the solar wind data ( the solid straight line indicates the logarithmic dependence ( 20 ) ) obtained from advanced composition explorer ( ace ) satellite magnetometers for the year 1998 ( fig .",
    "6 ) and for the year 2004 ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "the so - called pumping scale @xcite @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) in ( 19),(20 ) can be defined from the figs .",
    "6 and 7 as intersection of the solid straight line with the temporal @xmath56 co - ordinate axis : @xmath85 .",
    "in order to get away from the effects of the earth s magnetic field , the ace spacecraft orbits at the l1 libration point which is a point of earth - sun gravitational equilibrium about 1.5 million km from earth and 148.5 million km from the sun .",
    "let us recall that the earth s magnetosphere extends into the vacuum of space from approximately 80 to 60,000 kilometers on the side toward the sun .",
    "therefore , the observed in figs .",
    "6,7 approximately 24h pumping time - scale of the magnetic field gradients can not be a consequence of the 24h - period of the earth s rotation .",
    "the pumping scale certainly corresponds to a process in the solar wind plasma itself .",
    "it could be a characteristic scale of the phase coherent structures in the solar wind , which can be distinguished from incoherent fluctuations in this case @xcite ( see more about characteristic periods in solar wind plasma in the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "it is now believed that energy of these coherent ( pumping ) large - scale structures is released via shear instabilities in the solar wind plasma .",
    "it is possible that for the very long time of the coexistence of earth and of the solar wind the weak interaction between the solar wind and earth could lead to stochastic synchronization between the earth s rotation and the characteristic time - scale ( the pumping scale ) of the solar wind magnetic field gradients .",
    "this synchronization could transform an original period of the earth s rotation to the period close to the pumping scale , which we observe at present time .",
