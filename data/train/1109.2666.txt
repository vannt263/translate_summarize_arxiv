    "in quantum theory , a measurement that provides information about a physical system inevitably changes the state of the system depending on the outcome of the measurement .",
    "this is an interesting property of quantum measurement not only in the foundations of quantum mechanics but also in quantum information processing and communication  @xcite such as quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there have been many discussions regarding the tradeoffs between information gain and state change using various formulations  @xcite .",
    "for example , banaszek  @xcite has shown an inequality between mean estimation fidelity and mean operation fidelity that quantifies information gain and state change , respectively .    in connection with such tradeoffs ,",
    "the author  @xcite has recently discussed tradeoffs together with physical reversibility  @xcite of measurement in the context of reversibility in quantum measurement  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the author  @xcite has shown tradeoffs among information gain , state change , and physical reversibility in the case of single - qubit measurements .",
    "an important feature of these tradeoffs is that they occur at the level of a single outcome without averaging all possible outcomes  @xcite .",
    "this feature originates from the fact that the physical reversibility of measurements suggests quantifying the information gain and the state change for each single outcome , because in physically reversible measurements , a state recovery with information erasure ( see the erratum of @xcite ) occurs because of the post - selection of outcomes .",
    "however , the explicit calculations in the previous studies  @xcite were only performed with two - level systems or qubits .    in this study , we calculate information gain and state change in a projective measurement of rank @xmath0 on a @xmath1-level system assumed to be in a completely unknown state .",
    "we evaluate the amount of information gain by a decrease in shannon entropy  @xcite and the degree of state change by fidelity  @xcite to express them as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these results lead to a tradeoff between information gain and state change at a single outcome level .",
    "we also consider the efficiency of the measurement with respect to fidelity .",
    "of course , projective measurements are not physically reversible  @xcite .",
    "however , they would correspond to special points as the most informative but the least reversible measurements in the tradeoffs among information gain , state change , and physical reversibility in general measurements on a @xmath1-level system .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : formulation ] explains the procedure to quantify information gain and state change and calculates them in the case of an @xmath0-rank projective measurement on a @xmath1-level system .",
    "section  [ sec : tradeoff ] discusses a tradeoff between information gain and state change and considers efficiency of the measurement with respect to the state change .",
    "section  [ sec : conclude ] summarizes our results .",
    "we evaluate the amount of information provided by a quantum measurement as follows .",
    "suppose that the pre - measurement state of a system is known to be one of the predefined pure states @xmath2 , @xmath3 , with equal probability @xmath4  @xcite , although the index @xmath5 of the pre - measurement state is unknown to us .",
    "thus , the lack of information about the state of the system can be evaluated by shannon entropy as @xmath6 before measurement , where we have used the shannon entropy rather than the von neumann entropy of the mixed state @xmath7 because what we are uncertain about is the classical variable @xmath5 rather than the predefined quantum state @xmath8 .",
    "if the pre - measurement state is completely unknown , as is usually the case in quantum measurement , then the set of the predefined states , @xmath2 , consists of all possible pure states of the system with @xmath9 .",
    "each state can be expanded by an orthonormal basis @xmath10 as @xmath11 with @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is the dimension of the hilbert space associated with the system .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 obey the normalization condition @xmath14    we next perform a quantum measurement on the system to obtain the information about its state .",
    "a quantum measurement is generally described by a set of measurement operators @xmath15  @xcite that satisfies @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the identity operator .",
    "if the system to be measured is in a state @xmath18 , the measurement yields an outcome @xmath19 with probability @xmath20 and then causes a state reduction of the measured system into @xmath21    here we consider performing a projective measurement because it is the most informative . in particular , we perform a measurement where the process yielding a particular outcome @xmath19 is described by a projection operator of rank @xmath0 ( @xmath22 ) ; that is , the measurement operator corresponding to the outcome @xmath19 is written without loss of generality as @xmath23 by relabeling the orthonormal basis , where @xmath24 is a complex number .",
    "the other measurement operators are irrelevant as long as condition ( [ eq : compcond ] ) is satisfied , since our interest is only at the level of a single outcome .",
    "the measurement then yields the outcome @xmath19 with probability @xmath25 when the pre - measurement state is @xmath8 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basis ] ) and ( [ eq : probability ] ) .",
    "since the probability for @xmath8 is @xmath4 , the total probability for the outcome @xmath19 becomes @xmath26 where the overline denotes the average over @xmath5 , @xmath27 on the contrary , bayes rule states that given the outcome @xmath19 , the probability for the pre - measurement state @xmath8 is given by @xmath28 thus , the lack of information about the pre - measurement state can be evaluated by shannon entropy as @xmath29 after the measurement yields the outcome @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we define information gain by the measurement with the _ single _ outcome @xmath19 as the decrease in shannon entropy  @xcite @xmath30 which is free from the divergent term @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) owing to the assumption that the probability distribution @xmath32 is uniform .",
    "in order to explicitly calculate the information gain ( [ eq : info ] ) , we introduce parametrization of the coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be the real and imaginary parts of @xmath35 , respectively : @xmath36 the normalization condition ( [ eq : norm ] ) then becomes @xmath37=1.\\ ] ] note that this is the condition for a point to be on the unit sphere in @xmath38 dimensions .",
    "this means that @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be expressed by hyperspherical coordinates @xmath41 as  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the index @xmath5 now represents the angles @xmath41 and thus the summation over @xmath5 is replaced with an integral over the angles as @xmath46 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) and ( [ eq : overline ] ) , we get @xmath47                   \\quad\\qquad 1      & ( r = d )          \\end{cases}\\ ] ] and @xmath48 using the integral formula @xmath49 where @xmath50 with the gamma function @xmath51 .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the information gain @xmath58 as a function of rank @xmath0 for @xmath59 .",
    "information gain @xmath58 when the projective measurement yields the outcome @xmath19 as a function of rank @xmath0 for @xmath59 . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the information gain monotonically decreases as @xmath0 increases and becomes @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "note that when @xmath61 , the measurement corresponds to an uninformative identity operation , since the measurement operator ( [ eq : operator ] ) reduces to the identity operator @xmath17 except for the constant @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath0 is fixed , the information gain monotonically increases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "thus , taking the limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : information ] ) as @xmath1 goes to infinity at @xmath62 , we find the upper bound on information gain as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is euler s constant .",
    "on the other hand , the measurement changes the state of the measured system .",
    "when the pre - measurement state is @xmath8 and the measurement outcome is @xmath19 , the post - measurement state is @xmath65 according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : reduction ] ) and ( [ eq : operator ] ) . to quantify this state change , we use fidelity  @xcite between the pre - measurement and post - measurement states , namely @xmath66 this fidelity decreases as the measurement increasingly changes the state of the system . averaging it over @xmath5 with the probability ( [ eq : conditional ] ) ,",
    "we evaluate the degree of state change as @xmath67 ^ 2       = \\frac{\\overline{q_m^2}}{\\;\\overline{q_m}\\ ; } \\label{eq : fide}\\ ] ] after the measurement yields the outcome @xmath19 , where for simplicity , we have averaged the squared fidelity rather than the fidelity .",
    "the fidelity ( [ eq : fide ] ) can be explicitly calculated using the parameterization ( [ eq : parameter ] ) as @xmath68 because of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qbar ] ) and @xmath69 figure  [ fig2 ] shows the fidelity @xmath70 as a function of rank @xmath0 for @xmath59 .",
    "fidelity @xmath70 when the projective measurement yields the outcome @xmath19 as a function of rank @xmath0 for @xmath59 . ]",
    "in contrast to information gain , fidelity monotonically increases with @xmath0 and becomes @xmath71 at @xmath61 . moreover , when @xmath0 is fixed , fidelity monotonically decreases as @xmath1 increases and becomes @xmath60 in the limit @xmath72 .    in terms of the density operator of the system , the measurement changes the maximally mixed state in @xmath1 dimensions , @xmath73 , into that in @xmath0 dimensions , decreasing the von neumann entropy of the system by @xmath74 .",
    "however , the information gain ( [ eq : information ] ) is less than @xmath75 because of our formulation of information resource  @xcite , i.e. a set of predefined states with shannon entropy rather than a density operator with von neumann entropy . within this formulation , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : information ] ) comes from the indistinguishability of non - orthogonal quantum states . to see this ,",
    "consider the orthonormal basis @xmath10 with @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis ] ) as the set of predefined states , instead of all possible pure states @xmath2 . in this distinguishable case",
    ", the information gain is equal to just the decrease in the von neumann entropy @xmath75 . therefore , the reduced information gain ( [ eq : information ] ) is due to the indistinguishability of predefined states . in other words , quantum measurement with no",
    "_ a priori _ information about the state of the system is not optimal as quantum communication between the system and observer , since its encoding and decoding procedure using all possible pure states suffers information loss by the indistinguishability of states .",
    "from the explicit formulae for the information gain ( [ eq : information ] ) and fidelity ( [ eq : fidelity ] ) , we find a tradeoff between information and fidelity in projective measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the fidelity @xmath70 as a function of the information gain @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "fidelity @xmath70 as a function of information gain @xmath58 for @xmath59 . ]    as the measurement provides more information about the state of a system , the process of measurement changes the state to a greater extent , as shown in fig .",
    "it should be emphasized that this tradeoff is at a single outcome level in the sense that there is no average over outcome .",
    "in addition , another relationship between information gain and state change can be shown by defining the efficiency of measurement as the ratio of the information gain to the fidelity loss  @xcite , @xmath76 figure  [ fig4 ] shows the efficiency of measurement , @xmath77 , as a function of rank @xmath0 for @xmath59 , although it is ill - defined at @xmath61 because of @xmath78 .",
    "efficiency of measurement @xmath77 as a function of rank @xmath0 for @xmath59 . ]",
    "the efficiency is a monotonically decreasing function for each @xmath1 and has a maximal value @xmath79 $ ] at @xmath62 in @xmath80 .",
    "this means that among the various projective measurements , a projective measurement on a two - level system or qubit is the most efficient with respect to fidelity .",
    "nevertheless , it is the least efficient among single - qubit measurements , as discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we calculated the information gain and fidelity of a projective measurement on a system where the pre - measurement state was assumed to be in a completely unknown state .",
    "they are expressed as functions of the dimensions @xmath1 of the hilbert space associated with the system and rank @xmath0 of the projection operator associated with the measurement , as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : information ] ) and ( [ eq : fidelity ] ) .",
    "these results show a tradeoff between information and fidelity at the level of a single outcome without averaging all outcomes , as shown in fig .",
    "we also discussed the efficiency of the measurement by using the ratio of information gain to fidelity loss . in terms of this efficiency ,",
    "a projective measurement on a two - level system or qubit is the most efficient among the various projective measurements .",
    "although here we have considered only projective measurements , there are many measurements that are not projective , e.g. , photodetection processes in photon counting  @xcite .",
    "such measurements can be less informative but more reversible than projective measurements",
    ". however , in general measurements on a @xmath1-level system , it would be difficult to find tradeoffs among information gain , fidelity , and physical reversibility because they are all functions of @xmath81 parameters  @xcite . to find the tradeoffs , our present results suggest some special points such as the endpoints of boundary curves in the tradeoffs , since projective measurements are the most informative but the least reversible .",
