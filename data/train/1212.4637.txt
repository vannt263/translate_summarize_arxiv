    "<S> we have uncovered , in the bose - hubbard model coupled to a dissipative environment , two unconventional relaxation regimes : at short times , and large enough fillings , a power - law regime , while at large times , and any filling , a stretched exponential regime . </S>",
    "<S> this last regime is dominated by rare events which correspond to the occupation of a single site with a large number of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the rare states in the tail of the distribution function @xmath98 are occupied with decreasing time scales @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> these ingredients alone allow to estimate the main time dependence of the fluctuations employing a simple saddle point argument . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath100 , the saddle point integration @xmath101 leads to @xmath102 recovering the stretched exponential . indeed , very slow transition rates , due to the high energetic cost of the processes connecting these rare configurations , dominate the long time dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this emergent glass - like dynamics is thus a signature of the complex level structure of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> dissipation , forcing the system to explore its whole configuration space , including rare and energetically unfavorable configurations , manifests the complex energy levels structure of the system . in future works , we plan to investigate existence of stronger connections beyond the dominating rare events to glassy physics , e.g.  the emergence of dynamical heterogeneity , aging phenomena @xcite or the physics of kinetic constraints model @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    experimental observation of these relaxation regimes is within reach . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in the following possible realizations for the stretched exponential regime which is experimentally more demanding to study . </S>",

    "<S> the realization of the dissipator in eq.(1 ) could be achieved by a noisy optical potential pattern , e.g.  due to an additional , time dependent , speckle beam @xcite or an incommensurate superlattice @xcite with a randomly changing phase or amplitude . since the strength of @xmath22 in these setups can be tuned by the intensity of the light fields , this allows to have @xmath109 or more . to observe the stretched exponential regime , a low filling , for example @xmath110 would be advantageous ( see fig.[fig : figa ] ) . for this filling and @xmath109 , the experimental time - scales needed to identify the stretched exponential regime are of the order of @xmath111s ( @xmath112 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figa ] ) and lattice occupations up to @xmath113 atoms per site will be occupied with a non - negligible probability . </S>",
    "<S> this required time - scale is small compared to the time - scale of the three - body losses ( for occupation of @xmath114 , the three - body loss scale is approx .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath115s @xcite ) and to the time - scale of secondary collisions with the background gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus these processes can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> further , transitions to higher bloch bands can be due to interaction of the highest occupied sites or by the dissipation . both can be neglected for experimentally relevant time - scales as i ) the next bloch band is approximately at an energy @xmath116 which is @xmath117 times the interaction energy @xmath118 for a large filling as @xmath114 and ii ) transitions due to dissipation can be controlled via engineering the noise spectrum and tuning the lamb - dicke parameter @xcite . </S>",
