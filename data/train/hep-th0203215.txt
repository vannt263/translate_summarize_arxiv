    "it seems that a paper with this title should necessarily start with a list of the reasons that make us believe that there should be an effective description of qcd in terms of strings@xcite .",
    "the more commonly cited arguments are the dominance of planar diagrams in the large @xmath1 limit@xcite ` filling in ' a surface ( interpreted as the world - sheet of a string ) , the expansion in terms of surfaces built out of plaquettes in strong - coupling lattice qcd@xcite , and the success of regge phenomenology@xcite , which can ultimately be understood in terms of string theory ideas ( although , as we will discuss a little bit later , the actual regge theory that corresponds to qcd can not be derived , at present , from any known string theory ) .    to these",
    "we could add two more reasons .",
    "one is the appearance in string theory of the universal ( at long distances ) lscher term@xcite .",
    "the static inter - quark potential provided by the string @xmath2 gets modified by quantum fluctuations by a coulomb - like piece @xmath3 . while for the heavy quark bound state calculations it is perturbative qcd ( complemented with some non - perturbative corrections ) that is applicable , and not the string regime , the lscher term is quite useful . finally , and in a completely different context , namely that of deep inelastic scattering , the evolution of the parton distribution down to low values of @xmath4 ( around ( 2 gev)@xmath5 ) leads@xcite to a low @xmath6 behavior for the structure functions of the form @xmath7 , while regge theory predicts @xmath8 , in striking good agreement .    in the last years",
    "the possibility of describing some non - abelian gauge theories in terms of string theories has become a reality thanks to the ads / cft relationship@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the gauge theories that one can describe , or rather solve , in this way possess an unrealistically large number of supersymmetries . breaking this large amount of supersymmetry to the realistic case of @xmath9 while decoupling the unwanted degrees of freedom from long - distance physics has proven to be a formidable task and one in which not much success has been attained yet .",
    "it should be clear to the reader from the very beginning that we are not addressing in this paper these deep and fundamental issues .",
    "yet , it is clear that the mentioned theoretical developments give credence to the idea that there must be some kinematic regime where the simplest bosonic string , obtained after integrating out all the remaining degrees of freedom made heavy by the breaking of supersymmetry , must provide an approximately valid description .",
    "in fact it is highly questionable where one should expect a string description to be exactly valid for real , non - supersymmetric , four - dimensional , asymptotically free qcd , as a string does not seem to be the natural language to understand high - energy processes in deep - inelastic scattering where the point - like structure of quarks and gluons is apparent",
    ". we should probably be less ambitious and satisfy ourselves with an effective description .",
    "we subscribe this point of view and think of strings as effective theories and not worry at all about their mathematical consistency as fundamental objects .",
    "it is surprising that even with this limited scope all known string theories fail to provide a description of low energy qcd . to see how this comes about",
    "let us recall the original veneziano amplitude@xcite .",
    "the original motivation for this _ ad hoc _ formula was to provide a description of hadrons that manifestly exhibited duality . while the evidence for duality was rather weak@xcite , at the time this amplitude sparked nambu@xcite to suggest that it should originate in bosonic string theory .",
    "after decorating the veneziano amplitude with the appropriate chan - paton@xcite factors , it is supposed to describe the scattering amplitude of four pions @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the regge trajectory .",
    "the regge trajectory slope is determined , after a fit , to be @xmath13 gev@xmath14 @xcite we immediately recognize that there are poles in the @xmath15-channel whenever @xmath16 .",
    "thus a tachyon is present for @xmath17 and we see the first of the problems alluded to in the abstract appearing .",
    "furthermore the second ( @xmath18 ) state ( which we should identify with the rho particle ) is massless .",
    "this is the second one of the problems we alluded to .    shortly afterward",
    ", supersymmetry was introduced in string theory@xcite , but unfortunately most of the difficulties with the bosonic string are still present in supersymmetric string theory when one applies it to the present context .",
    "the relevant amplitude for our purposes is the four tachyon amplitude @xmath19 now @xmath20 is the so - called @xmath21-trajectory which in regge theory describes exchanges of particles with positive @xmath22-parity .",
    "this is the lovelace - shapiro amplitude and it contains no tachyonic poles .",
    "could it then be a candidate to describe pion scattering ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "it does not have the appropriate adler zero , i.e. the property that at @xmath23 the pion scattering amplitude vanishes .",
    "and although it has no tachyons in the intermediate channel , unfortunately , the vertex which is supposed to represent the pion is a tachyon itself .",
    "furthermore , the first resonance in the @xmath21-trajectory ( supposed to represent the physical @xmath21 particle ) has zero mass .",
    "all in all , one is at the same dead end .",
    "a fix@xcite to this problem consists in arbitrarily changing the intercept in @xmath24 . indeed , if we write @xmath25 and use eq .",
    "( [ neveu ] ) , the resulting amplitude has poles in the @xmath15 or @xmath26-channel when @xmath27 .",
    "it has no tachyons and the first pole , which is massive , can be identified with the @xmath21 particle .",
    "furthermore , the previous amplitude has the right adler zero . expanding this amplitude in powers of @xmath15 and @xmath26 and comparing with the amplitudes obtained from an effective lagrangian , polyakov and vereshagin@xcite found that @xmath28 , which numerically turn out to be quite acceptable values was established earlier in bosonization models @xcite and in the chiral quark model@xcite by means of a derivative expansion of quark determinant .",
    "however at that time its possible connection with a string description of qcd was not recognized . ] .",
    "unfortunately , no known string theory leads to such a fix in the intercept , and hence the intercept by adding additional terms in the string action , rigidity , for instance@xcite or imposing constraints on the string motions@xcite .",
    "however spectroscopy suggest that while such terms might exist they are probably of limited influence .",
    "moreover the conformal invariance of a modified string becomes questionable . ] .",
    "it is believed that the ultimate reason for the presence of a tachyon in the spectrum lies in a wrong choice of the vacuum@xcite . since the choice of the spin zero vertex operator , @xmath29 , is based on the lorentz properties alone , it is the same both for scalar and pseudoscalars and , accordingly , both scalars and pseudoscalars have tachyonic poles in the @xmath15-channel on account of parity conservation .",
    "the situation is thus parallel to the one in multicomponent @xmath30 theory with @xmath31 , where perturbing around @xmath32 gives negative @xmath33 values for all components .",
    "it is natural to assume that the amplitudes obtained through the use of the canonical vertex operators correspond to ( unphysical ) amplitudes for excitations perturbed around the wrong , unphysical vacuum .",
    "these ideas have in fact been around for a long time , but no one appears to have implemented them in any practical way .    in a previous paper@xcite by some of the present authors a possible line of attack was suggested .",
    "the idea is the following . given that with the present string theory technology it is impossible to find the ` true ' vacuum , let us assume that the vacuum is non - perturbative in string creation and annihilation operators and that it actually corresponds to the true qcd vacuum . in this case ,",
    "the relevant ( lightest ) degrees of freedom are the ones emerging after the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . in the physical vacuum of qcd",
    "there is a clear distinction between scalars ( sigma particle ) and pseudoscalars ( pions ) .",
    "the sigma particle is just another hadronic resonance with a mass in the 1 gev region and without any specially important role to play .",
    "the massless pseudoscalars , on the other hand , can be collected in a unitary matrix @xmath34 which under chiral transformations belonging to @xmath35 transforms as @xmath36 and describes excitations around the non - perturbative vacuum . from the string point of view @xmath34 is nothing but a bunch of couplings involving the string variable @xmath6 .",
    "our goal is to find a consistent string propagation in this non - perturbative background .",
    "a crucial property of string theory is , undoubtedly , conformal invariance .",
    "this amounts to demanding that the theory is independent of the specific conformal factor chosen to describe the two - dimensional world sheet .",
    "while this is a desirable and , as a matter of fact , a crucial property of fundamental strings , it might not be necessarily so for the qcd string ( if we look at the qcd string with a magnifying glass we shall eventually see quarks and gluons , not the string itself ! ) .",
    "however in the limit of large @xmath37 the qcd hadronic amplitudes are saturated by gluon fishnet diagrams among which any higher order samples give , in principle , a comparable contribution .",
    "thereby it appears plausible that there should be no dependence on a specific choice of configuration describing a dominating gluon propagation .",
    "therefore the hadronic string action should obey reparameterization invariance of diagram surfaces and conformal invariance . since conformal invariance must hold when perturbing the string around any vacuum , perturbative or not , we have a powerful tool at our disposal , namely to couple the chiral field @xmath34 to the string degrees of freedom and demand conformal invariance .",
    "exactly in the same way as einstein equations are derived from string theory@xcite by requiring the vanishing of the beta function for an external metric @xmath38 .",
    "this approach was followed in @xcite with mixed success .",
    "the lowest order chiral lagrangian , or rather the equations of motion coming from it , were obtained and the whole approach seemed consistent .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath0 coefficients were identically zero .",
    "experimentally these are numbers of order @xmath39 .",
    "we have now found out the reason for this failure .",
    "it turns out that the action considered in @xcite is only a particular case of the general case , and one that does not allow a proper treatment of the unitarity condition of the external source @xmath34 .",
    "when the general case is considered , unitarity and locality can be implemented consistently at least at the order we have worked and , as a consequence of the new terms in the action , new divergences and hence new contributions to the beta function for @xmath34 appear .",
    "these lead to @xmath0 terms in the effective lagrangian .",
    "these are the results we would like to report here .",
    "the hadronic string in the conformal gauge is described by the conformal field theory action in the four dimensional euclidean space - time @xmath40 where for @xmath41 one takes @xmath42 the conformal factor @xmath43 is introduced to restore the conformal invariance in @xmath44 dimensions , and this is the only way it enters the theory .",
    "the regge trajectory slope ( related to the inverse string tension ) is known to be universal @xmath45 gev@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we would like to couple in a chiral invariant manner the matrix in flavor space @xmath34 containing the meson fields to the string degrees of freedom while preserving general covariance in the two dimensional coordinates and conformal invariance under local scale transformations of the two - dimensional metric tensor .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath34 field will then be obtained from the condition that the quantum theory must be conformally invariant , i.e. the @xmath46 functional for the @xmath34 couplings must vanish .",
    "since the string variable @xmath6 does not contain any flavor dependence , we have to invent a way to couple it to the background @xmath34 variable .",
    "we introduce two dimensionless grassmann variables ( ` quarks ' ) , or rather several families of them , living on the boundary of the string sheet : @xmath47 which transform in the fundamental representation of the light flavor group ( @xmath48 in the present paper ) . a local hermitean action @xmath49 is introduced on the boundary @xmath50 to describe the interaction with background chiral fields @xmath51 where the normalization scale @xmath52",
    ", the weak pion decay constant , is introduced to relate the field @xmath53 to a @xmath54-meson one .",
    "the boundary lagrangian is chosen to be reparameterization invariant and in its simplest minimal form reads @xmath55 herein and further on a dot implies a @xmath56 derivative : @xmath57 . in order to arrive to eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) a number of field redefinitions have been made .",
    "it is impossible to simplify eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) any further .",
    "details are given in appendix a.    a further restriction is obtained by requiring @xmath58 invariance .",
    "there are two @xmath58-like transformations .",
    "the first one is @xmath59 the above lagrangian is @xmath58 symmetric for @xmath60 .",
    "the second one is @xmath61 under this transformation the lagrangian becomes invariant only for @xmath62 .",
    "we interpret the first @xmath58 transformation as the physical one and the one which one should require of a lagrangian describing strong interactions .",
    "the above coupling may appear surprising at first and somewhat _",
    "ad hoc_. to see that this is not so , let us expand the non - linear field @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath63 and retain the first two terms .",
    "the first term just gives rise to a @xmath64-function propagator which eventually leads to the familiar ordering in the usual string amplitudes @xmath65 .",
    "the second term just provides ( after integrating the fermions out ) the usual ( tachyonic ! ) vertex . in short ,",
    "if we ignore the non - linearities in the theory we are back to the usual difficulties .",
    "it is easy to see that the previous action is invariant under general coordinate transformations of the two dimensional world sheet .",
    "the fermion action is automatically conformally invariant , because it does not contain the two dimensional world sheet metric tensor since it can be written as a line integral .    in @xcite the cases",
    "@xmath66 were considered .",
    "none of them is a valid one on symmetry grounds .",
    "now we expand @xmath67 around a constant background @xmath68 and look for the potentially divergent one particle irreducible diagrams ( 1pi ) .",
    "we classify them according to the number of loops .",
    "each additional loop comes with a power of @xmath69 .",
    "we expand the function @xmath34 in powers of the string coordinate field @xmath70 around a constant @xmath68 which is the translational zero mode of the string @xmath71 one can find a resemblance to the familiar derivative expansion of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "indeed perturbation theory in the operators ( [ expan ] ) makes sense as a low momentum expansion which is presumably valid up to momenta approaching to the mass of the first massive resonance ( @xmath21 meson etc . ) . in the present case",
    "@xmath69 is the dimensional parameter normalizing the above expansion .",
    "the free fermion propagator is @xmath72 if we impose @xmath58 symmetry then @xmath73 for unitary chiral fields @xmath34 .",
    "the free boson propagator projected on the boundary is @xmath74 the latter results hold in dimensional regularization ( see below ) .    in order to make contact between dimensional regularization , a short - distance cut - off ( which we shall later use ) and regge phenomenology we need to unambiguously fix the normalization of the string propagator .",
    "this can be inferred from the definition of the kernel of the n - point tachyon amplitude for the open string@xcite .",
    "the veneziano amplitude corresponds to the insertion of vertex operators @xmath75 on the boundary of the string . after resolution of the gaussian",

    "we shall determine the counterterms required to make the beta functional for the coupling @xmath34 vanish up to the two loop level . in spite of the relative complexity of the feynman rules ,",
    "the fact that we are working with a boundary field theory is crucial in making the calculation manageable .",
    "in fact most diagrams can be determined by simply playing with integration by parts and using basic properties of the dirac delta function . yet",
    "the renormalization is quite non - trivial and the ultraviolet structure of the counterterms is surprisingly quite complex .",
    "it is thanks to this complexity that non - zero values for the @xmath0 coefficients can be obtained .",

    "we have to turn to the @xmath0 effective lagrangian to get non - universal results .",

    "only one solution is possible , implying @xmath173 thus , comparing eq .",
    "( [ dim4 ] ) with the usual parameterization of the gasser and leutwyler lagrangian@xcite , @xmath174 for @xmath175 gev@xmath14 and @xmath176 mev it yields @xmath177 which is quite a satisfactory result@xcite .",
    "so far we have paid no attention to the unitarity of @xmath98 at the two - loop level .",
    "does the variation implied by @xmath133 and @xmath178 respect the perturbative unitarity of @xmath98 ? or does this lead to a new constraint eventually incompatible with the numerical previous numerical values ?",
    "it turns out ( see appendix i ) that if one accepts arbitrary real coefficients in the set of dimension - four vertices included in ( [ dimen4 ] ) then the only solution compatible with the unitarity is given by the parameterization with constants @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "thus the requirement to preserve unitarity under field renormalization is entirely equivalent to the local integrability condition , similarly to the case of dimension - two operators .",
    "this is a remarkable result that hints to the consistency of the whole procedure .",
    "conformal invariance is a subtle issue . as we have discussed in detail in the introduction",
    "this is a necessary ingredient for the consistency of string theory and it is , according to general principles of field theory , equivalent to requiring the vanishing of the beta functions .",
    "there are several sources of breaking of conformal invariance in the present model . we have been concerned with the equations of motion for the @xmath34 string field functional .",
    "the beta functional has been computed up to two loops , properly including the unitarity constraints .",
    "the vanishing of the single pole divergences at one loop leads to the familiar non - linear sigma model . at two loops the @xmath0 terms of gasser and leutwyler appear .",
    "the numerical values turns out to be identically determined by the arguments of locality and unitarity and they therefore determine the ` renormalized ' value of @xmath125 in terms of the constant @xmath181 .",
    "the latter being the coefficient of a single loop divergence in an integral appears to be manifestly universal .",
    "the former could be in principle ambiguous since a change in the renormalization scheme ( for instance by choosing the subtraction to a value different from @xmath182 in the @xmath6-propagator ) may shift a finite piece between @xmath148 and the renormalized value of the coupling .    however , this ambiguity is of no relevance . the requirements of locality and unitarity seem to restrict the ` measurable ' value of @xmath125 to specific , well determined values .",
    "if one changes the renormalization scheme by a finite amount @xmath183 , the ` measurable ' couplings will all change by the same amount to @xmath184 , but it is this last quantity the one that will then appear in the equations of motion and will be related to @xmath181 , which is universal , so this change of scheme is immaterial .",
    "furthermore , the renormalized couplings @xmath125 are conformal factor independent , so the relations determined in the previous section hold in any conformal frame and so are the values for the @xmath0 coefficients of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "this is of course in full agreement with general considerations based in qcd and chiral lagrangians ( in the large @xmath1 limit , that is , where the string picture is supposed to hold ) .    in @xcite",
    "a general , but tentative , argument ( based in conformal invariance ) was given that , if valid , would imply the vanishing of the @xmath0 coefficients to all orders in the inverse string tension . here",
    "the argument simply fails because the additional couplings which are required to renormalize the model are dimensional .",
    "these couplings were not considered in @xcite because the need for additional counterterms was not manifest along the renormalization process due to the ( incorrect ) choice of the value of @xmath97 .",
    "of course this immediately raises a new issue .",
    "the new counterterms seem to entail a breakdown of ` classical ' conformal invariance . indeed , introducing the coupling @xmath123 , which are of dimension",
    "@xmath127 makes the action non - conformally invariant already at the classical level , in a way that is similar to the introduction of a coupling to the tachyon in the familiar bosonic string theory .",
    "although the issue is somewhat independent of the equations of motion for the matrix field @xmath34 we have to give an answer to this difficulty if conformal invariance is to hold .    to demand conformal invariance in the string - mode sector , we have to guarantee the vanishing of the trace of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this issue can be discussed in several ways , but let us proceed to determine the trace of the energy momentum tensor . on general grounds we can write @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the beta function for the @xmath187-th coupling and @xmath188 the accompanying operator . then , when computing the trace of the energy momentum tensor , the part of the tensor bilinear in fermion fields leads to a contribution that contains operators of the form ( [ count ] ) with their couplings @xmath123 replaced by the appropriate beta functions .",
    "these beta functions contain a classical , purely engineering , part as well as a quantum one , which has been computed in the text , and which is the same for all couplings @xmath123 . in the string - mode sector",
    "their contribution is given by the averaging over the fermion vacuum and it vanishes according to the arguments presented in the appendix d. there is no a fermion induced string action when the @xmath58 symmetry ( [ cp1 ] ) holds .",
    "thus the presence of conformally non - invariant interaction on the boundary does not affect conformal symmetry in the bulk .    throughout this paper",
    "we have systematically used conventional perturbation theory and the fermion loop expansion which however may be more cumbersome when one proceeds to the vertices with larger number of emitted bosons and to higher orders in the loop expansion . as an alternative ,",
    "direct functional methods can be developed , an example of which is displayed in the appendix j. this approach can be also exploited to show how to go ahead without fermions and so bypassing the potential problems related to breakdown of conformal anomaly since it allows a formulation where the ` quarks ' are integrated out .",
    "doing so apparently removes any conformal anomaly present in the boundary as we just discussed .    on the other hand , at some point we do expect a genuine breakdown of conformal invariance .",
    "this is so because of the conformal anomaly that the bosonic string theory must necessarily exhibit .",
    "in fact , this breakdown ( tantamount to introducing a scale dependence ) is quite welcome as we do not expect the simple string picture presented here to be even approximately true at very short distances ( even within the large @xmath1 limit ) .",
    "the naive bosonic string action used in the present paper does not prevent large euclidean world sheets from crumpling @xcite .",
    "it does not also describe correctly the high - temperature behavior of large @xmath1 qcd @xcite .    according to by now common",
    "lore@xcite , the dependence on the conformal factor has to be understood in terms of the renormalization group flow .",
    "this dependence has not been worked out in detail , but it would be feasible to take it into account perturbatively in a way not too different from standard sigma model calculations in string theory by including dilaton , spin two , etc .",
    "backgrounds . the dilaton beta function",
    "precisely contains the @xmath189 term characteristic of the anomaly . at some order in the @xmath69 and topological expansion there",
    "would appear a coupling between the dilaton and the chiral fields through the exchange of @xmath6 string variables .",
    "it would be interesting how the hadronic degrees of freedom can modify the anomaly condition , if at all",
    ".    a qcd induced string action may also include nonlocal @xcite or , at least , higher - derivative @xcite vertices breaking manifestly conformal symmetry which help to make the strings smooth and supply the correct high - temperature asymptotics .",
    "however , as we are concerned here with the low - energy string properties we do not expect that the strategy and technique to derive the chiral field action needs any significant changes to be adjusted to a modified qcd string action .",
    "the only changes may come out from the short distance behavior of the modified string propagator .",
    "finally we enumerate some of the simplifications and missing points of the approach undertaken in the present paper .",
    "\\1 ) from the beginning we have restricted ourselves to the @xmath48 global flavor group .",
    "the reason is that only parity - even terms in the equations of motion can be revealed from the simple fermion lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "as it is supposed that all relevant meson degrees of freedom are reproduced by the hadronic string one can not expect the appearance of multi - fermion interaction which may effectively arise only due to heavy - mass reduction of glueballs and hybrids suppressed in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "then the only way to obtain the parity - odd wess - zumino - witten terms is to supplement one - dimensional fermions with spinor degrees of freedom , i.e. , for instance , to add reparameterization invariant vertex @xmath190 with dirac matrices @xmath191 and new dimensional constant @xmath192 .",
    "this extension will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "\\2 ) one can easily add external electromagnetic fields and thereby calculate also the chiral constants @xmath193 .",
    "however it is not yet clear how to introduce current quark masses consistently with the open string picture with ultra - relativistic quarks at their ends .",
    "hence the other chiral constants need more efforts to be understood within the string approach if the boundary fermions were indeed associated with quarks .",
    "\\3 ) going back to the possibility of higher derivative @xcite or nonlocal @xcite or five - dimensional @xcite action for the hadronic string , we find it interesting to explore the traces of deviations from the conformal string theory in low - energy chiral constants and phenomenology .",
    "including the running of the @xmath0 coefficients would however require the introduction of @xmath194 corrections .",
    "we do not know if the string picture can be consistently implemented when subleading corrections are taken into account .",
    "\\4 ) as we have mentioned in this section and emphasize here once more the conformal anomaly can hopefully be taken into account consistently within the present approach , but he have not really attempted to do so in this present work .",
    "this is a major challenge that we leave for the future .",
    "\\5 ) the value for the coefficients of @xmath0 that we have found are , up to the usual factors of @xmath54 , etc .",
    "rational numbers . in other words",
    ", they are not the first terms in the taylor expansion of a @xmath195 function or similar transcendental functions",
    ". what would be the appropriate amplitude replacing veneziano formula then when the proper symmetries of the qcd vacuum are considered such as in the present case ?",
    "we do not know .",
    "all things considered , we believe that the objectives we set in the introduction have been achieved . we have obtained the leading effective action for low energy qcd from two very simple requirements : chiral invariance and conformal symmetry and two simple ideas : perturbing about the true vacuum of qcd and using the simplest possible effective world - sheet action .",
    "the approach seems to be oversimplified , but has proven to be considerably robust .",
    "all cross checks and physical requirements are met .",
    "the outcome is very sensible from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "perhaps more importantly , several interesting avenues are open for future exploration and a fully consistent approach may be developed .",
