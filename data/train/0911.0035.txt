    "the evolution and dissipation of protoplanetary disks has been an active area of research for the last few decades ; especially the advent of sensitive near- and mid - infrared observations has allowed us to explore inner disk regions ( out to a few au ) , encompassing the radii where planets are thought to form .",
    "the role of planet formation in disk dissipation has been all but proven ; while disks likely evolve from a flared , optically thick configuration to a flat , settled disk via grain growth and settling , it is not clear to what extent the eventual dissipation of the remaining dust and gas and the formation of planets are linked .",
    "a key evolutionary stage in disk dissipation is the transition from the classical t tauri stage , when a pre - main - sequence star is surrounded by an accreting disk , to the weak - lined t tauri phase , when accretion ends and the disk disappears .",
    "this transitional stage is believed to be short ( @xmath1 10@xmath2 years ) , since only few stars with vanishing infrared excesses have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for example , in the nearby and well - studied taurus star - forming region @xcite , out of a total of 111 t tauri stars , five objects were identified whose inner disk regions are cleared to different degrees , but outer , optically thick disks remain , delimited by a well - defined inner disk rim @xcite .",
    "planet formation , photoevaporation , or inner disk draining induced by the magneto - rotational instability may play a role in removing the inner disk @xcite , but also close binary companions can clear inner regions due to orbital resonances @xcite .",

    "@xcite detected millimeter - continuum emission from v819 tau and inferred a disk mass of 0.032 @xmath20 , implying that its outer disk is fairly massive .",
    "however , the far - ir sed of @xcite had to rely on _ iras _ data , which are not reliable for such a faint source : according to @xcite , the _ iras _ 25 and 60 @xmath0 m fluxes of v819 tau are both 100 mjy , while our data shows that the flux at 30 @xmath0 m amounts to 20 mjy . in addition , later measurements by @xcite and @xcite only determined an upper limit to the 1.3 mm flux of 9 and 2.5 mjy , respectively , and @xcite could also only give upper limits to the 450 and 850 @xmath0 m fluxes ( 317 and 9 mjy , respectively ) ; the latter authors determined a disk mass of less than 0.0004 @xmath20 .",
    "thus , it seems that the outer disk is not very massive .",
    "since the more recent measurements are much more precise , they should be favored when interpreting v819 tau .",
    "given that the excess emission from this t tauri star is weak , earlier data with less sensitive instruments are more uncertain .",
    "the object 10  to the south of v819 tau is even fainter ; its low infrared flux values support the suggestion of @xcite that it is likely a background star due to its low luminosity and its inferred age that places it well below the main sequence when plotted with evolutionary tracks .",
    "opposite to what we found for v819 tau , the new _",
    "data of hbc 427 show that the infrared excess seen in the long - wavelength part of the irs spectrum is attributable to a nearby companion , hbc 427/1 .",

    ". however , without any additional data , we can not conclusively determine the nature of this object .",
    "the very low - mass star v410 x - ray 3 is fainter than v819 tau or hbc 427 ; only a careful new reduction of its irs spectrum showed that it does not have an infrared excess .",
    "a blackbody fit to the 5 - 14 @xmath0 m spectrum also matches the 15 - 35 @xmath0 m fluxes ( see figure [ v410xray3_irs ] ) .",

    "@xcite find that a very small excess of @xmath9 0.4 mag may be present in mips 24 @xmath0 m data , which is smaller than our upper limit of @xmath9 1 mag for an excess at this wavelength .",
    "more sensitive observations at longer wavelengths are necessary to confirm this small excess ; given the current data , we consider v410 x - ray 3 as diskless .",
    "our irs spectrum confirms the transitional disk nature of v819 tau , but it reveals that the mid - infrared excess is much smaller than previously thought ( see figure [ v819tau_irs ] ) ; it sets in at about 8 @xmath0 m , and @xmath21 is roughly constant with wavelength between 23 and 33 @xmath0 m .",
    "the very small infrared excess ( @xmath22 10@xmath23 ) makes v819 tau the most advanced transitional disk in the taurus sample observed to date .",
    "also , as opposed to the other transitional disks , whose inner holes are delimited by a disk wall that gives rise to a steep continuum slope beyond 13 @xmath0 m , the spectral index between 13 and 25 @xmath0 m for v819 tau is more negative , in a range typical for settled disks @xcite .",
    "v819 tau is a k7 star @xcite , which suggests @xmath5=4060 k @xcite ; combined with a luminosity of 0.81 @xmath24 ( kh95 ) , we derive a stellar radius of 1.8 @xmath25 . using evolutionary tracks computed by @xcite",
    ", we infer a stellar mass of 0.8 @xmath20 ( as well as an age of 2 myr ) , which indicates that the surface gravity is of the order @xmath26 3.5 - 4.0 .",

    "however , the low excess flux at longer wavelengths is not typical for optically thick emission . assuming optically thin emission from gray grains in radiative equilibrium whose absorption cross section equals their geometric cross section ( i.e , large , blackbody grains )",

    "more realistically , the absorption efficiency varies with wavelength , as is the case for smaller grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in the photosphere - subtracted spectrum . if the dust grains are small ( sub-@xmath0 m ) , their absorption efficiency in the infrared is less than at shorter wavelengths , leading to so - called superheating , which would result in a grain being at a somewhat larger distance from the star than a blackbody at the same temperature .",
    "the lack of substantial excess emission below about 8 @xmath0 m suggests that the inner disk regions are cleared of small dust grains . in order to derive the disk structure of v819 tau",
    ", we applied an optically thin model fit to the infrared excess emission ( 8 - 34 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "we adopted the optical constants of `` astronomical '' silicates from @xcite and chose different grain sizes with various surface density distributions ( which act as a scaling factor for the emission ) to match the observed excess .",
    "the grain size distribution was assumed to vary as a power law with an index of -3.5 . at each distance from the star , we calculated the equilibrium temperature for the average grain size , and then integrated the optically thin emission from all grains over a certain radius range to achieve a good fit .",
    "a range of model parameters results in fits that reproduce the weak 10 and 20 @xmath0 m silicate emission features and rising continuum seen in the photosphere - subtracted spectrum : minimum grain sizes from 0.1 to 0.5 @xmath0 m , maximum grain sizes of 0.5 or 1 @xmath0 m , an inner disk radius of 1 au , and outer disk radii from 300 to 800 au .",

    "one process that can generate cleared inner disk regions is photoevaporation @xcite ; it sets in once the mass accretion rate has dropped to levels below a few 10@xmath46 @xmath20 yr@xmath42 , and it acts by eroding the disk in a photoevaporative flow beyond a certain radius , which , for v819 tau , amounts to 7.1 au .",
    "this value is larger than the inner radius of our best - fit optically thin disk models , but it is remarkably close to the value of 6.8 au we estimated by assuming the excess emission to arise from an optically thick , blackbody surface .",
    "however , it seems that the dust emission is optically thin , given the presence of 10 and 20 @xmath0 m silicate emission features and the low infrared excess luminosity ( @xmath22 10@xmath23 ) .",
    "moreover , our models require small dust grains at distances of at least @xmath9 1 au from the star . thus , photoevaporation can not explain the inner disk clearing of v819 tau ; a change in grain opacity caused by grain growth to sizes well beyond 1 @xmath0 m in this region , or the gravitational influence of another body , such as a planet , are possible explanations for the inner disk clearing .",
    "the question also arises whether the material we detect around v819 tau is primordial or already second - generation dust .",
    "detection of gas emission from the inner disk would support the primordial nature of the disk ; so far , the absence of accretion signatures and h@xmath45 emission from the inner disk suggest that the gas has already dissipated . without the gas ,",
    "dust particles would be subject to collisions , poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag , radiation pressure , and corpuscular stellar wind pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which , in the region from @xmath9 1 to 100 au from v819 tau , would limit the lifetime of sub-@xmath0 m grains to @xmath1 10@xmath2 years .",
    "therefore , in the absence of gas , dust would have to be continuously replenished , since the age of v819 tau is about 2 myr .",
    "v819 tau would be one of the youngest debris disk systems ; its infrared excess would lie on the higher side of what is usually measured in debris disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but still within the observed range .",
    "collisions among planetesimals , as are thought to occur in debris disks , typically produce larger grains ( @xmath47 10 @xmath0 m ) , since the mid - infrared spectra of the majority of debris disks are featureless @xcite .",
    "the fact that small , amorphous silicate grains dominate the optically thin emission of v819 tau , with just a minor possible presence of crystalline silicates , suggests that the dust we observe consists of mostly pristine material . colliding or evaporating comet nuclei , which likely form in the outer disk regions and therefore incorporate more unprocessed silicates into ice",
    ", could be the source of this pristine dust .",
    "it is also possible that we are just observing `` true '' primordial , unprocessed dust from large disk radii ; this would imply that we are witnessing a rare stage in the life of a protoplanetary disk , when the gas has already been mostly removed from the inner disk , and the remaining dust is dissipated on a timescale of 10@xmath2 years or less .",
    "then , not only could the disk structure of v819 tau be described as transitional due to the lack of infrared excess below @xmath9 8 @xmath0 m and the clear presence of such an excess beyond 12 @xmath0 m , but also the evolutionary stage of this object could be considered transitional , i.e. , having just transitioned from a primordial , optically thick disk to an optically thin one . even though a few percent of the t tauri population in taurus can be considered as transitional ( defined as disks with substantial inner disk clearings and thus low near - infrared excesses ; @xcite ) , v819 tau would stand out by its very low infrared excess .",
    "it would be the only object in taurus observed so far at an advanced transitional stage , when the disk material is already optically thin .",
    "given the small amount of dust left in the disk , planet formation would have to be already completed in this disk ; this conclusion would also apply if the dust were second - generation and therefore the result of dynamically perturbed , remnant planetary building blocks .",
