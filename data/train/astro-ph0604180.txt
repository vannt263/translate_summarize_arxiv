    "the bulk of the neutron - capture ( @xmath8-capture ) elements beyond the iron group are created by some combination of the slow and rapid neutron - capture nucleosynthesis processes ( @xmath9- and @xmath0-process ) , with each responsible for approximately half of the isotopes . in the @xmath0-process ,",
    "both the neutron density and neutron flux are high .",
    "neutron - rich sites associated with massive star core collapse supernovae ( sneii ) are the likeliest sites for the @xmath0-process ( see , cowan & thielemann , 2004 and references therein ) , although the astrophysical site of the @xmath0-process has yet to be identified .",
    "possible sites for the @xmath0-process include : supernovae winds / hot bubbles ( see , hoffman , woosley , & qian 1997 ; terasawa   2002 ; wanajo  2002 ; kohri , narayan , & piran 2005 ; and references therein ) ; disks and jets ( , cameron 2003 and references therein ) ; neutron star mergers ( , freiburghaus , rosswog , & thielemann 1999 ; rosswog  1999 ; and references therein but also see argast  2004 for a contrasting view ) and/or neutron star formation during accretion induced collapse ( , wheeler , cowan & hillebrant 1998 ; cohen et al .",
    "2003 ; qian & wasserburg 2003 ) .    among the isotopes formed in the @xmath0-process are the radioactive group of elements known as the actinides , which include isotopes of th and u. due to their known radioactive decay rates , the abundances of th ( and u ) in low - metallicity stars have been employed to derive the ages of presumably some of the oldest stars in the galaxy , thereby setting a minimum for the age of the universe .",
    "critical assumptions in the analysis of the observations are that the production ratios of the elements are known , and that the elements under investigation arise from the same nucleosynthetic site . following earlier work on the derivation of th abundances and/or th - based ages by @xcite , @xcite , and franois , spite & spite ( 1993 ) , @xcite derived the first th / eu - based nucleocosmochronometric age for a very metal - poor star : cs  22892 - 052 , whose extreme @xmath0-process abundance enhancements were discovered by @xcite .",
    "this was followed soon after by other th / eu - based age determinations of very metal - poor stars by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in most of these studies",
    ", the use of th / eu cosmochronometry has yielded consistent results ( , , hd  115444 , and ) .",
    "a weak u detection was made in  @xcite and an upper limit was derived for   @xcite , permitting lower limits to be placed on ages inferred by the th / u ratio , which turn out to be in accord with those derived from th / eu cosmochronology . however , in the case of cs  31082 - 001 , for which the first u abundance determination was made in an ultra metal - poor star @xcite , the age inferred from th / eu is found to be significantly different from that inferred from th / u @xcite .",
    "discrepant age results have also been reported for hd  221170 by  employing the abundances they derived for th / u and th / eu .    the fundamental assumption built into the technique of applying these abundances to derive ages via nucleocosmochemistry is that the elements are created in the same processes ,  the same nucleosynthetic sites , and track the contributions of that process through galactic chemical evolution ,  a production ratio can be specified .",
    "there is no doubt that all of the th and u is produced in the @xmath0-process : the termination point of the @xmath9-process occurs at @xmath10bi .",
    "isotopes heavier than @xmath10bi decay too quickly to be built by the @xmath9-process . and , eu is predominantly an @xmath0-process element  over 90  % of the solar eu was produced this way @xcite .",
    "however , th lies 29 atomic mass units away from eu .",
    "it has been argued that the production of the actinide elements may not be known sufficiently well to trust their use as nucleocosmochronometers ( see , arnould & goriely 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "certainly , with lighter @xmath8-capture isotopes , there is evidence that multiple @xmath0-process sites or sources have contributed to the total abundance in both the sun and in metal - poor stars . while at low metallicities the observed abundances of @xmath0-process - rich stars in the atomic range of @xmath6 56 are in good agreement with the predicted scaled solar @xmath0-process patterns @xcite , the abundances of the lighter @xmath8-capture elements are not @xcite .",
    "furthermore , based on studies of the inferred abundances of short - lived isotopes in the early solar system , multiple sites or sources have been required to explain the early solar system abundances of both light and heavy isotopes normally considered to be of primary @xmath0-process origin ( see , cameron , thielemann , & cowan 1993 ; wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 ; meyer & clayton 2000 ) .    in the sun ,",
    "the abundances are the integrated result of many generations of stars , including millions of sneii , and depend upon the details of the star formation history , initial mass function , chemical yields , etc . however , the heavy element abundances most useful for unravelling the origins of the @xmath0-process correspond to those observed in stars which formed from material with little prior nucleosynthetic processing , such as the relatively pristine material out of which extremely metal - poor stars were born . to further explore the @xmath8-capture elemental abundances in @xmath0-process - rich stars , we observed the bright ( @xmath11 = 7.7 ) metal - poor red giant branch star .",
