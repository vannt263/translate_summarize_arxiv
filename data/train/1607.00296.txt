    "the exploration of inelastic processes , with the goal of obtaining reliable data on the corresponding cross section , are considered as a powerful tool in understanding the dynamics taking place in slow ion@xmath3atom collisions .",
    "usually , models using a molecular basis set are applied to determine the transition probabilities between the terms corresponding to the main inelastic channels . however",
    ", such terms , due to the complicated many - channel character , have been calculated for only a small number of simple collision systems .",
    "therefore , the schematic correlation diagrams of diabatic molecular orbitals are widely used .",
    "however , they provide only a qualitative explanation of the processes .",
    "the situation becomes more problematic from an experimental point of view when particles with closed electron shells are involved in the collision process .",
    "there are several reasons for this , but mainly it is related to the following : 1 ) precise measurements of cross sections for ionization and charge exchange processes require collection and identification of all secondary particles ; 2 ) a reliable determination and control of the relative and absolute spectral sensitivity of the light - recording system while performing an optical measurement is needed .",
    "it is known that in such collisions these processes take place at relatively small impact parameters corresponding , on avarage , to large momentum transfers .",
    "because of this the inelastic processes are realized when the incident ions are scattered through relatively large angles and , due to momentum conservation , this is accompanied by the formation of much more energetic secondary particles than for weakly bound valence electrons .",
    "the energy of these secondary particles ( ions and free electrons ) may reach tens of electron volts , therefore , their full collection is problematic . at the same time , these secondary particles along with primary particles are used to determine cross sections .",
    "this circumstance has not been considered in the earlier works @xcite measuring cross sections for ionization and charge - exchange processes . therefore , some doubts related to the reliability of these data and , hence , conclusion drawn from them , seem to be indicated .",
    "for example , in case of ionization processes , a standard capacitor method was used @xcite which yields significant inaccuracies in measurements of cross sections , because no measures were taken to prevent the scattering of primary and high - energy secondary ions . as to charge - exchange processes",
    ", the magnitude of almost all previously obtained cross sections @xcite are underestimated , which is caused by the fact , that the method used for the detection of neutral particles failed to ensure collection of those particles which were scattered through large angles .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to reinvestigate some collision systems more accurately and some for the first time .",
    "these studies require combined experimental approaches , incorporating with the methods which are free of the deficiencies mentioned above , and a variety of reliable experimental data for more persuasive interpretation . from the other side one can use schematic correlation diagrams to interpret the data and to identify the mechanisms leading to the processes being investigated .",
    "research on alkali - metal ion collisions with rare gas atoms have been carried out by a variety of methods @xcite , however the available data for the absolute cross sections of the above mentioned processes are not always consistent with each other @xcite and in some cases , unreliable ogurtsov4 .",
    "the objectives of present work are detailed studies of processes induced by an interaction of closed - shell alkali - metal ions of li@xmath4 k@xmath4 and na@xmath5 with atoms of rare gases ar and he .",
    "we performed measurements of absolute differential and total cross sections for charge - exchange , ionization and excitation processes in li@xmath0ar , k@xmath0ar , and na@xmath0he collisions in the range of ions energy 0.5@xmath310 kev . in collisions of a li@xmath4 k@xmath4 or na@xmath5 ion beam with ar and he atoms we focus on the following charge - exchange processes :    @xmath6    where the products of the reaction can be in the ground states or in different excited states .",
    "the collisions can induce the following ionization processes :    @xmath7    the reactions ( [ lie ] ) - ( [ nae ] ) represent ionization processes for the target atoms , that include different channels for the excitation of the produced ions of the target atoms or / and incident ions , as well as the excitation of autoionization states of the target atom that leads to its ionization . in collisions of k@xmath5 and na@xmath5 ions with ar and he atoms our study is focused on the following excitation processes : @xmath8the excitation processes ( [ k * ] ) and ( [ na * ] ) include different channels for excitation of the k@xmath5 or / and ar atom , and the na@xmath5 ion or / and he atom , respectively .",

    "@xcite using the detection of fast neutral particles with a restricted interval of scattering angles .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this limiting condition on the interval for collision angles in ref .",
    "ogurtsov4 underestimated the measured charge - exchange cross sections for all collision systems and , particularly , for k@xmath0 ar this underestimation reaches more than a factor of ten .",
    "the absolute excitation cross section of the potassium resonance spectral line for the k@xmath0ar collision is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , however it was measured just for low energies , up to 0.7 kev . a convincing result , though in a limited energy interval 1@xmath33 kev , for the excitation cross section of summed spectral ar lines @xmath10 @xmath11 nm in k@xmath0ar collision system are presented in ref .",
    "double differential cross sections for the k@xmath0ar collision system have also been measured in ref .",
    "an inelastic collision mechanism for the systems of li@xmath0he and li@xmath0ne has been studied experimentally and theoretically in ref .",

    "this brief survey of above mentioned processes occurring in alkali - metal ion impact with atoms of rare gases shows that today there is no systematic experimental measurements and reliable data available .",
    "most of experimental results are either provided in arbitrary units or reported for a restricted energy interval . to our mind , the reason for this scarcity of measurements is linked with the difficulties of performing the research with close electron shell particles : scattering on large angles and problem of collection of secondary particles .",
    "this circumstance motivates the present detailed investigation of the primary mechanisms for these collision processes .",
    "we have so far studied collisions between closed electron shell particles for the k@xmath0he , na@xmath0ne , na@xmath0ar , ne@xmath0na , and ar@xmath9na collision systems @xcite . in this paper , we report systematic studies of absolute total cross sections for charge - exchange , ionization and excitation for the li@xmath0ar , k@xmath0ar , and na@xmath0he collisions in a broad range of collision energies ( 0.5@xmath310 kev ) , as well as the energy - loss spectra for the k@xmath0ar collision system .",
    "we have also measured the energies of the electrons liberated in the collisions .",
    "we have found that for the k@xmath0ar collision , the energy of most of the liberated electrons are within the interval 20@xmath332 ev , the electrons energy are less than 17 ev for the na@xmath0he collision , and below 12 ev for the li@xmath0ar collision system .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "the experimental techniques and measurement procedures are described and three different experimental methods of measurements are presented . here",
    "we introduce the procedures for measuring of absolute total and differential cross sections for charge - exchange , ionization and excitation processes .",
    "the description of our measurements and the comparison of them with the results of previously obtained experimental studies for the charge - exchange , ionization and excitation occurring in the li@xmath0ar , k@xmath0ar , and na@xmath9he collisions are given in sec .",
    "the discussion of experimental results , and determination and clarification of the mechanisms for the charge - exchange , ionization and excitation processes are presented in sec .",
    "finally , in sec.v , we summarize our investigations and present the conclusions .",
    "the main experimental set - ups used in the present experiments for measurements of total and differential cross sections for charge - exchange , ionization and excitation processes are the following : i. the refined version of a capacitor method ; ii . a collision spectroscopy method ; iii .",
    "an optical spectroscopy method .",
    "the basic approach for measurements of inelastic processes realized in collision of an alkali - metal ion with rare gases atoms was described previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , so only the details of the apparatus with description outline of methods and measurement procedures will be given here .",
    "a beam of li@xmath5 , k@xmath5 , or na@xmath5 ions from a surface - ionization ion source is accelerated , formed , and focused by an ion - optics system , which includes quadruple lenses and collimation slits @xcite .",
    "after the beam passes through a magnetic mass spectrometer , it enters the collision chamber containing target ar or he gasses .",
    "the pressure in the collision chamber is kept at about 10@xmath16 torr , while the typical pressure under operation with the ar and he target gasses is a two order of magnitude less .",
    "this ensures single - collision conditions for the ion - target atom collision .",
    "the charge - exchange and ionization cross section were measured by a refined version of the capacitor method @xcite .",
    "this method allows preventing the electrodes by the scattering primary ions that affect the results of measurement .",
    "the secondary positive ions and free electrons produced during the collision are collected and detected by a collector .",
    "the collector consists of two rows of plate electrodes that ran parallel to the primary ion beam .",
    "a uniform transverse electric field , that extracts and collects secondary particles , is created by the potential applied to the grids .",
    "this method represents a direct measurement of the yield of produced singly positively charged ions and free electrons as the primary beam passes through the target gas .",
    "obviously , the measured quantities are related to the capture cross section and the apparent ionization cross section @xcite . the uncertainties in the measurements of the charge - exchange cross sections for the li@xmath0ar , k@xmath0ar , and na@xmath0 he collision systems are estimated to be 7% , 15% , and 10% , respectively , while the uncertainties in the measurements of the ionization cross sections are estimated to be 12% , 10% , and 15% , respectively .",
    "these uncertainties are determined primarily by the uncertainties in the measurements of absolute value of the cross sections for production of positively charged ions and free electrons , as the primary beam passes through the target , and by the uncertainty in the measurement of the target gas pressure in the collision chamber .",
    "the energy - loss spectra and differential scattering experiments are performed by the collision spectroscopy method . since",
    "the details of the apparatus have been given elsewhere @xcite , only a brief description is presented here . the primary beam extracted from the ion source",
    "was accelerated to the desired energy before being analyzed according to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the ion s charge and mass , respectively ) . the analyzed ion beam after being collimated by a slit enters into the collision chamber and then passes into a box  type electrostatic analyzer .",
    "the energy resolution of this analyzer is @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the voltage applied to the analyzer is scanned automatically which allows to investigate the energy - loss spectra in the energy range of @xmath22 ev . the differential cross section is measured by rotating the analyzer around the center of collision over an angular range between 0@xmath23 and 20@xmath23 .",
    "the laboratory angle is determined with respect to the primary ion beam axis with an accuracy of 0.2@xmath24 .",
    "such a tool gives us the option to determine the total cross sections and compare them with the results obtained by the refined version of the capacitor method @xcite .",
    "in addition , the measured energy - loss spectra provide detailed information related to the intensity of inelastic processes realized in the charge - exchange , ionization and excitation reactions .",
    "the method used for the optical measurements was discussed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , therefore , only brief description will be given here .",
    "the alkali - metal ion beam leaving the surface - ionization ion source after acceleration to a predetermined energy is focused by the quadruple lenses and analyzed by a mass - spectrometer .",
    "the emerging ions passes through a differentially pumped collision chamber with the target gas at low pressure .",
    "the light emitted from the collision chamber as a result of the excitation of colliding particles , is viewed perpendicularly to the beam by an optical spectrometer .",
    "the spectral analysis of the radiation is performed in the vacuum ultraviolet and in the visible spectral regions .",
    "the linear polarization of the emission in the visible part of the spectra is analyzed by a polaroid and a mica quarter - wave phase plate .",
    "a photomultiplier tube with a cooled cathode is used to analyze and detect the emitted light .",
    "the spectroscopic analysis of the emission in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral region is performed with the seya ",
    "namioka vacuum monochromator incorporating a toroidal diffracting grating .",
    "the radiation is recorded by the secondary electron multiplier used under integrating or pulse - counting conditions .",
    "the polarization of the radiation in the vacuum ultraviolet region is not taken into account .",
    "we determine the absolute excitation cross sections by comparing the measured output signal with the one that is obtained due to the excitation of nitrogen molecule by electron impact .",
    "particular attention is , therefore , devoted to the reliable determination and control of the relative and absolute spectral sensitivity of the light - recording system in the visible part of spectra .",
    "the latter is done by measuring the photomultiplier output signal due to the bend of the first negative system of the ion n@xmath25 ( b@xmath26x@xmath27 transition ) and due to the mainel system ( a@xmath28x@xmath29 transition ) excited in collisions between the electrons and nitrogen molecules @xcite .",
    "these bands cover the wavelength interval between @xmath30 nm and @xmath31 nm .",
    "the output signal is normalized to the @xmath32 band ( @xmath33 nm ) which has the highest intensity in this range .",
    "the relative spectral sensitivity of the light recording system obtained in this way is compared with the measured relative excitation cross sections for the same bands , averaged over the experimental data reported in refs .",
    "the absolute uncertainties in the excitation cross section for the k@xmath0ar and na@xmath0he colliding system are estimated to be 15% and the uncertainty of relative measurements is about 5% .",
    "_ 3.1 . _ the measured energy dependences of the absolute cross section for the charge - exchange , ionization and excitation processes are presented in figs . @xmath34 .",
    "figure 4 represents a typical example of the energy - loss spectrum for k@xmath0ar collisions .",

    "<S> absolute cross sections are measured for charge - exchange , ionization , and excitation within the same experimental setup for the li@xmath0ar , k@xmath0 ar , and na@xmath0 he collisions in the ion energy range @xmath1 kev . </S>",
    "<S> results of our measurements along with existing experimental data and the schematic correlation diagrams are used to analyze and determine the mechanisms for these processes . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results show that the charge - exchange processes are realized with high probabilities and electrons are predominately captured in ground states . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section ratio for charge exchange , ionization and excitation processes roughly attains the value @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of various partial inelastic channels to the total ionization cross sections are estimated and a primary mechanism for the process is defined . the energy - loss spectrum , in addition , </S>",
    "<S> is applied to estimate the relative contribution of different inelastic channels and to determine the mechanisms for the ionization and for some excitation processes of ar resonance lines for the k@xmath0ar collision system . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation function for the helium , as well as for the sodium doublet lines for the na@xmath0he collision system , reveals some unexpected features and a mechanism to explain this observation is suggested . </S>"
