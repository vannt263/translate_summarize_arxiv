    "neutrino physics has entered the precision era . in particular , the entries of the unitary pmns matrix @xmath1 are known with quite good precision . in general",
    ", @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a rotation with angle @xmath4 around the @xmath5-axis , e.g. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 here @xmath8 with @xmath9 the cp - violating dirac phase and @xmath10 contains the majorana phases .",
    "harrison , perkins , and scott first emphasized that the experimentally obtained mixing matrix is close to the simple tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm ) form @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "the apparent closeness to the tbm scenario invites to propose a parametrization of the pmns matrix with tbm as the zeroth order expression . this `` triminimal '' parametrization is @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath13 with small @xmath14 .",
    "the virtues of triminimality are ( i ) each small @xmath14 is responsible for the deviation of , and only of , @xmath15 from its tri - bimaximal value ; ( ii ) the element @xmath0 is @xmath16 and therefore possesses exactly the form as promulgated in the pdg - description of mixing matrices ; ( iii ) is it obviously unitary .",
    "the other mixing observables besides @xmath0 are @xmath17",
    "the majorana mass matrix is defined as @xmath18 and takes a quite simple form in case of tbm : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are functions of the masses and majorana phases , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the given matrix is in fact obtained from a slightly modified ( but physically identical ) @xmath21 , which corresponds to choosing @xmath22 in the standard pdg - description of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdg ] ) .",
    "the most straightforward way to perturb tbm is to perturb every mass matrix entry , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and so on . in total , there are six independent @xmath25 , all of which are complex : @xmath26 .",
    "we bound in the analysis , described in detail in @xcite , @xmath27 and vary the phases between zero and @xmath28 .",
    "the implied deviations from tbm depend strongly on the neutrino mass ordering and scale .",
    "we find that the magnitude of @xmath29 is the most sensitive parameter .",
    "atmospheric neutrino mixing is less sensitive , while @xmath30 has nothing to say at all . for a normal hierarchy of neutrino masses",
    ", @xmath31 has a maximal value of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is one of the @xmath25 and @xmath34 is the ratio of solar and atmospheric mass - squared differences .",
    "[ fig : ar ] shows a scatter plot resulting from the analysis .",
    "it compares broken tbm also with the predictions from 13 successful @xmath35 guts , almost all of which predict @xmath36 . in the inverted hierarchy , in turn , broken tbm can lead to @xmath31 proportional to @xmath37 without suppression through @xmath34 .",
    "it can therefore be as large as 0.01 , while for quasi - degenerate neutrinos the complete allowed parameter space can be covered .",
    "all these features allow to distinguish guts from broken tbm if the mass ordering is known .",
    "the last two cases have an interesting correlation with neutrino - less double beta decay : if there is no cancellation in the effective mass @xmath38 , then @xmath29 is negligible , while for maximal cancellation @xmath29 can reach or exceed 0.1 .",
    "with `` no cancellation '' we denote the situation in which @xmath39 , while `` maximal cancellations '' have occurred when @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the largest neutrino mass .    in principle included in the presented analysis are radiative corrections , because they can be estimated with good precision by zero @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the sm and mssm , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that rg running leads to @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 are the mixing angles in case of tbm , and @xmath48 the sign and the size of the rg effects can be easily estimated now , depending of course on the neutrino mass ordering and hierarchy .",
    "to give one example , a value of @xmath49 requires typically neutrino masses @xmath50 ev and @xmath51",
    ". in this case one requires a suppression of @xmath52 through @xmath53 to keep @xmath30 under control .",
    "this is equivalent to maximal cancellation in the effective mass governing neutrino - less double beta decay .",
    "charged lepton corrections are quite popular when it comes to perturbing mixing scenarios @xcite . using the relation @xmath54 ,",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath55 corresponds to tbm and @xmath56 is , gut - inspired , ckm - like .",
    "this means that it is given only by a 12-rotation with angle @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", one can show that @xmath58 here @xmath59 is a phase showing up in @xmath55 and @xmath60 is the jarlskog invariant for neutrino oscillations .",
    "hence , there is a direct correlation between @xmath0 , @xmath61 and cp violation . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath62 is large , e.g. , the sine of the cabibbo angle , then its contribution to @xmath61 is dangerously large unless we suppress it with @xmath63 . in this case , the cp phase is maximal @xcite .",
    "there is an alternative way of charged lepton corrections , namely when @xmath64 corresponds to tbm and @xmath55 is ckm - like @xcite . in this case",
    ", there is a correlation in analogy to the one above , but now with atmospheric neutrino mixing , @xmath65 and cp violation .",
    "it is harder to test because @xmath66 is smaller than in the previous case .",
    "recently a hint for non - zero @xmath0 emerged from global fits of neutrino data @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite determines a @xmath67 range of @xmath68 , with a total significance of @xmath69 for non - zero @xmath29 . from the previous discussion",
    "are typical also for guts . ]",
    "it is clear that values of @xmath49 can be obtained by :    * soft breaking of a tbm ( or a @xmath70@xmath71 symmetric ) mass matrix in case of an inverted hierarchy or quasi - degenerate neutrinos .",
    "a characteristic signature in mass - related neutrino experiments , in particular neutrino - less double beta decay , follows in these regimes ; * charged lepton corrections to tbm from @xmath56 with @xmath72 , a number interestingly not too far away from the sine of the cabibbo angle ( or one third of it ) . in fact , the @xmath67 range given above corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "a characteristic correlation with solar neutrino mixing and cp violation ( @xmath74 or @xmath75 ) is obtained ; * rg corrections to tbm in the mssm with sizable @xmath76 ev and @xmath51 .",
    "cancellations in the effective mass are required in order to suppress running of @xmath30 .",
    "note that mssm - related lepton flavor violating processes typically grow with @xmath77",
    ".    it will be interesting to see if the currently weak hint survives or becomes more significant . in the likely case of one of the deviation possibilities being dominant , future precision data",
    "will then help us distinguishing them . in any case",
    ", the value of @xmath65 used here can be regarded as an interesting and testable benchmark scenario .",
