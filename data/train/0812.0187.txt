    "in principle qcd is the fundamental theory that describes hadronic systems , but its non - perturbative character makes a direct application to hadrons difficult , with the exception of the high energy and momentum transfer regime .",
    "fortunately , at low @xmath2 effective field theories based on effective hadronic degrees of freedom have been applied with success .",
    "examples are chiral perturbation theory @xcite , small scale expansion @xcite , soliton models and constituent quark models @xcite .",
    "constituent quark models provided consistent descriptions encompassing the low - energy baryon spectrum , elastic and inelastic form factors , charge and magnetic radii , magnetic moments , axial and pseudoscalar form factors @xcite .",
    "although all those different frameworks may include the essential features of qcd , which are confinement and chiral symmetry , they are only partial simulations of the true underlying theory .    recently , significant progress has occurred in calculations of qcd in the lattice , which evaluate the important qcd non - perturbative contributions at low @xmath2 directly from the underlying theory . up to now the applications of lattice qcd",
    "are restricted still to large pion masses ( @xmath3 mev ) corresponding to heavy quarks , and lattice spacings that are one order of magnitude smaller than the size of the nucleon ( @xmath4 fm ) . to extract information on the real world the results",
    "must be extrapolated both to the continuum limit ( @xmath5 ) and to the physical pion mass regime @xcite . however , except for the limit to the physical region , there is no simple way of interpreting the lattice qcd data .    in this work",
    "we invert this procedure .",
    "we take here the challenge of describing the lattice data using a quark model .",
    "we start with the constituent quark model obtained from the covariant spectator theory .",
    "our model was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was adjusted to the experimental data for the four nucleon elastic form factors and the dominant form factor of the @xmath1 transition . in this work",
    "we extend this model to the unphysical region of the lattice data .",
    "although the constituent quark models were originally thought for and applied to the physical limit , a constituent quark model that is simultaneously consistent with the experimental data and lattice qcd data is valuable , because it includes indirectly the constraints of qcd , and therefore satisfies properties of the underlying theory .",
    "a similar procedure was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite using a larger number of parameters .",
    "our model does not include explicit pion cloud effects .",
    "however , as the electromagnetic interaction with the quarks is parametrized according to vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , part of the pion cloud effects are indirectly taken into account .",
    "therefore the model can be applied in the regions where the valence quark degrees of freedom are dominant , and it gives a good description of the nucleon and @xmath6 systems @xcite .",
    "for the nucleon , pion cloud effects are fundamental in the time - like region @xcite , although they are not so important in the region of small positive @xmath2 values @xcite , which is involved in the study of the electromagnetic transition . for the @xmath1 transition , as it happens also to other constituent quark models , without explicit pion cloud effects , the predictions for the magnetic moment , which dominates the transition , deviate necessarily from the data for low @xmath2 , showing that an effective pion cloud within the vmd current is not sufficient .",
    "because of the opening of the @xmath7 channel , an explicit pion cloud contribution must be considered @xcite .",
    "therefore our results in the physical low @xmath2 region give only the constituent quark core contributions @xcite , usually labeled as `` bare '' contributions .",
    "our results for these contributions are consistent with independent calculations of dynamical reaction models @xcite based on hadronic degrees of freedom . as for the e2 and c2 multipoles , in the large @xmath8 limit @xcite",
    "they represent second order corrections and are not considered here .    as pion cloud effects in lattice qcd are expected to be small for @xmath9 0.40 gev @xcite , the description of the lattice qcd data appears as the ideal testing ground for our constituent quark model , where pion cloud effects are not explicitly included .",
    "this defines the main goal of this work . at present",
    ", lattice calculations are still restricted to high pion masses @xmath10 350 mev , although technical improvements are increasingly allowing to reach nearer and nearer the physical region @xcite . in this work we took the quenched lattice qcd data from refs .",
    "@xcite . in the unquenched calculations the effects of the sea quarks",
    "are explicitly considered .",
    "although unquenched lattice qcd data is already available , it is not expected that the quenched and unquenched data differ substantially in the region @xmath9 0.40 gev @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are some differences between unquenched data for the @xmath1 transition based on two different unquenched methods at similar pion masses @xcite that still have to be clarified in the future . for these reasons we took the conservative option of using quenched data exclusively .",
    "our new model presented here is based on three specific features : i ) the electromagnetic interaction with the constituent quarks is described within the impulse approximation , and considering vmd ; ii ) the wavefunctions of the quark - diquark system are parametrized by simple monopole factors reduced to the hulthen form , with one or two effective range parameters that balance the details of the short range and the long range behavior of the system ; iii ) the constituent quark magnetic anomalous moment scales with the inverse of its mass , which we write , following @xcite as a function of the current quarks mass .",
    "a current based on vmd is suitable to describe the interaction of the photon with the constituent quark , for the quark - antiquark spin-1 vertex .",
    "depending on the isospin , the intermediate meson pole corresponds to the @xmath11 or the @xmath12 meson , at low @xmath2 , or , in the large @xmath2 regime , to some other effective heavy meson pole @xmath13 .",
    "the photon interaction is then described as proceeding through the production of an intermediate meson state which annihilates subsequently into a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "vmd is successful in the description of the electromagnetic interaction with nucleons .",
    "the nucleon s - state wavefunction includes the correct spin structure for the quark - diquark spin 0 and 1 components , associated to isospin 0 and 1 states , respectively . for the @xmath6 ,",
    "since total isospin is @xmath14 , the s - state wavefunction reduces to the diquark spin 1 with isospin 1 structure . as for the scalar wavefunction",
    ", it takes the phenomenological form _ b ( p , k ) = , [ eqpsis ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the baryon mass ( for the nucleon or @xmath6 ) , @xmath18 is the diquark mass and @xmath19 is a normalization constant . [ in ref",
    ".  @xcite we considered @xmath20 for the nucleon and @xmath21 for the @xmath6 ] . the parameters @xmath23 can be interpreted as yukawa mass or range coefficients that distinguish between two different regimes for the momentum range .",
    "the parametrization of the momentum dependence in terms of @xmath24 absorbs the dependence on the baryon masses @xmath17 .",
    "the range parameters @xmath23 for the nucleon and the @xmath6 were fixed by the nucleon and @xmath1 form factor experimental data @xcite . in the spectator quark model the transition amplitude between a initial ( momentum @xmath25 ) nucleon ( @xmath0 ) and a final ( momentum @xmath26 ) baryon @xmath15 can be written , in impulse approximation @xcite as j^= 3 _ _ k    complete baryon wavefunction ( including spin , isospin and momentum dependence ) , @xmath27 is the diquark polarization and @xmath28 the quark current operator dependent of the hadron isospin @xmath29 .",
    "the baryon polarizations are suppressed for simplicity .",
    "the symbol @xmath30 represents the invariant integral in the on - shell diquark moment @xmath31 , with @xmath32 as the diquark energy .",
    "the factor 3 takes account for the isospin symmetrization .",
    "the quark current @xcite takes the general form j_i^&= & ( f_1+(q^2 ) + f_1- ( q^2)_3 ) ^+ + & & ( f_2+(q^2 ) + f_2- ( q^2 ) _ 3 ) .",
    "the constituent quark form factors @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are parametrized using a vmd structure , and are normalized according to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are defined in terms of the quark anomalous magnetic moments @xmath38 and @xmath39 according with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .    in this first calculation",
    "the wavefunctions are reduced to s - states for the quark - diquark system . although it is well known that angular momentum components besides the s - states are essential for the description of the nucleon in deep inelastic scattering , their effects are not so evident in the elastic form factors , particularly for low @xmath2 @xcite . as for the @xmath6 , calculations of the valence quark contribution associated with higher angular momentum states ( d - states ) suggest a small effect @xcite . in fact , even with only s - wave components in the wavefunctions for both the nucleon and the @xmath6 , the model generates the dominant contribution for the @xmath1 transition , the dipole magnetic moment form factor .",
    "the non - zero contributions for the other form factors appear only when d states are included , or when pion cloud effects are taken in consideration @xcite . at the end , we will estimate the effect in the @xmath1 quadrupole transition form factors , in the lattice regime , from adding the d - states to the present model .    as shown in @xcite",
    "the diquark mass scales out from the formulas obtained for the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "this allowed us to ignore any explicit dependence on the quark mass .",
    "this mass dependence was present in the nucleon , @xmath6 and vector meson masses in an implicit way only .",
    "however , in order to grant a comparison of our results with the lattice data , we extend here the model to include a dependence of the quark anomalous moment @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the quark mass .",
    "this dependence was not explicitly considered in refs .",
    "@xcite because they dealt only with the physical data .    inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , which combines chiral symmetry with conventional quark models , and applies an analytic continuation of the chiral expansion to the simple su(6 ) model , we then use the smooth variation of the hadronic properties with the current quark masses above 60 mev .",
    "therefore , in the spirit of the constituent quark models , we assume here that @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) scales with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the constituent quark mass .",
    "labeling the quark anomalous moment at the physical point by @xmath46 , we can write @xmath42 , for an arbitrary constituent quark mass @xmath45 , as _ q= _ q^0 , [ eqkq ] where @xmath47 is the constituent quark mass at the physical point .    to include an explicit dependence on the quark mass we consider the parametrization due to cloet _ et .",

    ".  @xcite we considered @xmath55 mev .",
    "the parametrization in ( [ eqmq ] ) is most sensitive to @xmath50 .",
    "reference @xcite fixes @xmath56 gev .",
    "different descriptions using quark models and different lattice sizes lead to different values @xcite . for this reason we use @xmath50 as the only free parameter allowed to vary in the calculation presented here .",
    "it is needed to introduce an explicit dependence of the nucleon magnetic moment on the pion mass , and to enable the connection of the constituent quark model to the lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "we consider three different cases .",
    "first we considered the case @xmath57 , corresponding to the limit where @xmath42 has no dependence on @xmath53 .",
    "we tested also the original parametrization @xmath58 0.42 gev @xcite .",
    "finally , although we did not performed a systematic fit , we tested several other values of @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , to extend the spectator model to the region of the quenched lattice qcd data we still need to consider the nucleon and @xmath6 masses determined by the lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "this brings to the calculation an implicit dependence on the pion mass . as for the vectorial mesons included in the vmd , quark current picture , we use the parametrization @xcite m_= c_0 + c_1 m_^2 , [ eqmrho ] where @xmath59 gev and @xmath60 gev@xmath61 . the simple parametrization ( [ eqmrho ] ) describes well the quenched lattice qcd data and is consistent with finite volume corrections @xcite . in this applications we consider this parametrization together with model ii of the refs .",
    "@xcite , where the heavy vectorial meson mass is @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the nucleon mass of the lattice calculations .",
    "in fig .  [ fignucleonff ] we compare the predictions of our model for the nucleon form factor with the lattice data from ref .",
    "@xcite , corresponding to the three values of @xmath50 .",
    "we consider in particular the isovector nucleon form factor because the contributions of the disconnected diagrams vanishes in lattice calculations , if the flavor su(2 ) symmetry is assumed as in ref .",
    "we considered the lowest pion masses and the smallest lattice spacings .",
    "in particular , we take the data corresponding to @xmath64 504 mev , 649 mev ( @xmath65 fm ) and @xmath66 mev ( @xmath67 fm ) . for larger lattice spacings a dependence on @xmath68 is observed @xcite . from the figure",
    "we conclude that @xmath56 gev and 0.80 gev gives an excellent description of the nucleon data .",
    "still , when the pion mass increases there is a systematic deviation of our model from the lattice data of ref .",
    "this deviation may be a consequence of the fact that the wavefunction parametrization in terms of a low momentum scale ( @xmath69 ) ( long range behavior ) and high momentum scale ( @xmath70 ) was kept unchanged .",
    "as the pion masses vary , at least the long range parameter may vary , and may vary more rapidly for larger pion masses . as for the short range parameter ( @xmath70 ) it sets the scale below which the short range physics becomes important . as observed in applications of the finite - range regularization effective field theory , the scale associated to the momentum cut - off ( and consequently short range effects )",
    "can be expressed by an universal regulator which describes simultaneously the large pion mass regime and the physical regime @xcite . in our calculation @xmath70",
    "is related to that universal regulator , and it is expected not to depend crucially on the pion mass value .    for a finer analysis of our results , we compare our predictions for the isovector nucleon magnetic moment in physical nucleon magnetons , with the lattice qcd data and the chiral result from ref .",
    "@xcite . to convert @xmath71 given by the lattice data in units @xmath72",

    "@xcite shows the consistency of our calculations with chiral calculations .",
    "finally , in fig .  [ figndeltaff ] we compare the quenched lattice data for the @xmath1 transition from ref .",
    "@xcite with the spectator quark model corresponding to @xmath76 gev , 0.80 gev and @xmath77 .",
    "all cases shown correspond to a lattice spacing of @xmath78 fm .",
    "the contribution of the quark core extracted from @xcite at the physical point is also included . to be consistent , we considered the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eqmrho ] ) for @xmath79 , although the original ref .",
    "@xcite gives slightly different results .",
    "as for @xmath63 and @xmath80 , we use the values derived directly from the lattice data @xcite . for the larger pion masses",
    "we observe an almost perfect agreement between the predictions of @xmath81 and the data , although @xmath82 gev is also close . for @xmath83 gev",
    "we have also a good agreement , except for a slight deviation from the lattice data for @xmath84 gev@xmath85 2 gev@xmath86 .",
    "this deviation may result from the effect of the pion cloud for light pions , predicted to be important for @xmath87 gev @xcite .",
    "as for the physical pion mass case , our model is coherent with the constituent quark core data labeled bare form factor , which is extracted indirectly from experiment @xcite . in this case all lines coincide .    as mentioned already",
    ", the d - states in the @xmath6 wavefunction induce contributions for the subleading electric and coulomb quadrupole transition form factors @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the exact contributions depend on the specific parametrization , in particular on the admixture coefficients for the two d - waves . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown how a percentage of d - states of @xmath90 can provide an excellent description of the quadrupole lattice data , without significantly changing the description of the dominant magnetic dipole form factor .",
    "that application corresponds to the @xmath91 limit and estimates the effect of the valence quark ( or bare ) contributions as only @xmath92 of the total quadrupole for both @xmath88 and @xmath89 , at the physical point ( the remaining contribution being the pion cloud ) . on the other hand , in that particular parametrization , and in the region of study @xmath93 gev@xmath86 , the effect of the constituent quark mass dependence described by eq .",
    "( [ eqkq ] ) corresponds to a correction of less than 20% for both form factors , a correction smaller than the typical lattice errorbands ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "chiral perturbation methods for lattice qcd extrapolations are useful for small @xmath2 ( like @xmath95 gev@xmath86 ) , but are not adequate for the high @xmath2 region .",
    "constituent quark models can supply an alternative guidance for lattice qcd extrapolations . in this work we consider a covariant constituent quark model of the nucleon and the @xmath6 based on the spectator formalism for the quark - diquark system ( covariance is an important issue for the description of the high momentum transfer processes ) .",
    "the model contains no explicit pion cloud , besides the effects included in the @xmath11 term of the vdm picture for the electromagnetic current , and is therefore reduced to the bare quark hadron structure . since pion cloud effects are expected to be negligible for large values of the pion mass , the comparison of the model to the quenched data for pion masses larger than 450 mev",
    "is justified a priori . to accomplish that comparison",
    "the initial covariant quark model was extended to the lattice data region , @xmath96 mev . in light of the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , this extension was done by introducing the constituent quark mass in the chiral limit parameter , @xmath50 , and the nucleon @xmath11 , @xmath6 masses used in the lattice calculations .",
    "the main conclusion is that the covariant constituent quark model which was previously calibrated by means of a quantitative description of the nucleon , @xmath1 and @xmath6 form factor data in the physical region , as shown in previous works @xcite , after a simple extension involving one parameter only , describes also quantitatively well the lattice results for the nucleon isovector form factor and the @xmath1 `` bare '' magnetic form factor . with @xmath56 gev , consistently with the range @xmath97 gev suggested by several constituent quark models @xcite , we obtain a very good description of the lattice nucleon form factors data , but underestimate the @xmath1 magnetic moment form factor data by less than 9% at low @xmath2 for @xmath98 mev .",
    "note that the original parametrization @xmath56 gev @xcite was a result of a phenomenological fit and was not derived from first principles .",
    "an optimal description of the lattice data for both nucleon and @xmath1 transition form factors is achieved , once the scale of the constituent quark mass in the chiral limit is fixed as @xmath75 gev . [ the values @xmath56 and 0.80 gev are better for the nucleon data ; @xmath75 gev and @xmath99 are better for the @xmath1 data ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 gev is relatively large when compared with alternative constituent quark models , which may indicate that some of the effective quark - antiquark configurations contained in our model through the vmd mechanism in the electromagnetic current , for instance , do not correspond to the lattice calculations in the quenched approximation .",
    "still , the possibility of adjusting other parameters is very promising .",
    "a refinement of the description can be pursued , by increasing the number of adjustable parameters , or simply by introducing an extra dependence on the pion mass .",
    "for instance , in the future we certainly plan to check the assumption that the @xmath100 parameter which controls the long range regime does not depend on the pion mass value .",
    "in addition , we may consider as well an explicit dependence of the heavier meson mass pole @xmath13 , that regulates the short range effect in vmd mechanism , on the pion mass . alternatively",
    ", a pion mass dependence of the @xmath101 parameter can be introduced .",
    "furthermore , we want to study the quality of the description in the high pion masses region , not probed yet here .",
