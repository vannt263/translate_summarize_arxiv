    "the randomness rate of an object is the ratio between the information in the object and its length .",
    "an informal principle states that no reasonable transformation can guarantee an increase of the randomness rate .",
    "the principle has different instantiations depending on the meaning of `` object '' , `` information , '' and `` reasonable transformation . '' for example , if @xmath4 is a mapping of the set of @xmath1-bit strings to the set of @xmath5-bit strings , then there is a distribution @xmath6 on the set of @xmath1-bit strings with shannon entropy @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , the randomness rate of @xmath6 is @xmath9 ) and the shannon entropy of @xmath10 is @xmath11 ( @xmath8 , the randomness rate of @xmath10 is @xmath12 ) . thus no transformation @xmath4 guarantees that its output has a randomness rate higher than that of its input .",
    "the case of infinite binary sequences ( in short , sequences ) is very interesting and has been recently the subject of intensive research .",
    "we say that a sequence @xmath13 has randomness rate at least @xmath0 if @xmath14 , for all sufficiently large @xmath1 . here",
    ", @xmath15 is the prefix of length @xmath1 of @xmath13 and @xmath16 is the kolmogorov complexity .",
    "a related notion is that of effective hausdorff dimension of a sequence @xmath13 , defined as : @xmath17 .",
    "reiman and terwijn  @xcite have asked whether for any sequence @xmath13 with @xmath18 there exists an effective transformation ( formally , a turing reduction ) @xmath4 such that @xmath19 .",
    "initially , some partial negative results have been obtained for transformations @xmath4 with certain restrictions .",
    "reimann and terwijn  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th 3.10 ) have shown that the answer is no if we require that @xmath4 is a many - one reduction .",
    "this result has been extended by nies and reimann  @xcite to wtt - reductions .",
    "bienvenu , doty , and stephan  @xcite have obtained an impossibility result for the general case of turing reductions , which , however , is valid only for _ uniform _ transformations .",
    "more precisely , building on the result of nies and reimann , they have shown that for all constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , there is no turing reduction @xmath4 such that for any sequence @xmath13 with @xmath23 has the property that @xmath24 . in other words , loosely speaking , no effective uniform transformation is able to raise the randomness rate from @xmath20 to @xmath21 . finally , very recently , miller  @xcite has fully solved the original question , by constructing a sequence @xmath13 with @xmath18 such that , for any turing reduction @xmath4 , @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 does not exist ) .    on the other hand , zimand  @xcite has shown that it is possible to increase the randomness rate if the input consists of _ two sequences _ that enjoy a certain type of _",

    "it is clear that the independence requirement plays an important role in the positive result .",
    "since independence can be quantified , it is interesting to see what level of independence is needed for a positive result .    for a function @xmath35 , we say that strings @xmath36 and @xmath37 have dependency @xmath38 if @xmath39 ; we say that two sequences @xmath13 and @xmath27 have dependency @xmath38 if , for every @xmath1 and @xmath5 sufficiently large , the strings @xmath40 and @xmath41 have dependency @xmath38 . with this terminology ,",

    "miller s result shows that this is impossible for dependency @xmath44 , while the result in  @xcite shows that this is possible for dependency @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , @xcite shows that , for certain combinations of parameters , an effective increase is possible even for dependency @xmath46 , for some @xmath47 .",
    "more precisely , it is shown that for any @xmath48 and @xmath49 , there exists @xmath47 and a truth - table reduction @xmath4 such that for any sequences @xmath13 and @xmath27 that have randomness rate @xmath34 and dependency @xmath46 , it holds that @xmath31 has randomness rate @xmath50 .    in this paper , we improve the above result and show that one can effectively increase the randomness rate even for two input sources that have linear dependency . more formally , our result is :    * we show that for every @xmath51 and @xmath49 , there exist @xmath52 and a truth - table reduction @xmath4 such that for any sequences @xmath13 and @xmath27 with randomness rate @xmath34 and dependency @xmath53 , the sequence @xmath31 has randomness rate @xmath54 .",
    "we also study the finite version of the problem , when the input consists of strings . similarly to the infinite case , our interest is in determining how many input strings and what level of dependency are necessary in order to exist an effective procedure that extracts kolmogorov complexity .",
    "vereshchagin and vyugin  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) have shown that one input string is not enough .",
    "they construct a string @xmath13 so that any shorter string that has small kolmogorov complexity conditioned by @xmath13 ( in particular any string effectively constructed from @xmath13 ) has small kolmogorov complexity unconditionally .",
    "on the other hand , fortnow , hitchcock , pavan , vinodchandran and wang  @xcite show that an input consisting of several independent strings can accomplish the task , when the number of strings in the input depends on the complexity of the strings .",
    "formally , they show that , for any @xmath0 there exists a constant @xmath55 and a polynomial - time procedure that from an input consisting of @xmath55 @xmath1-bit strings @xmath56 , each with kolmogorov complexity at least @xmath2 , constructs an @xmath1-bit string with kolmogorov complexity @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 means that the inequality holds within an error of @xmath60 ) . in view of vereshchagin - vyugin result",
    ", the question is whether effective extraction of kolmogorov complexity is possible from two input strings .",
    "we have two results in this regard :    * we show that if strings @xmath13 and @xmath27 of length @xmath1 have dependency @xmath61 and complexity @xmath2 , then it is possible to effectively construct a string of length @xmath62 and complexity @xmath63 , where @xmath64 ( @xmath59 ) means that the equality ( resp . , the inequality ) is within an error of @xmath60 .",
    "the construction is uniform in @xmath65 .",
    "note , however , that unlike the procedure from  @xcite , the construction does not run in polynomial time .",
    "* our second result shows that from strings @xmath13 and @xmath27 , with sufficiently large complexity and sufficiently small dependency , it is possible to construct a string @xmath66 that has large complexity even conditioned by any of the input strings . more precisely if @xmath13 and @xmath27 are strings of length @xmath1 that have complexity @xmath67 and dependency @xmath68 , then it is possible to effectively construct a string of length @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the construction is uniform in @xmath72 .",
    "this improves a result from  @xcite , where the input consists of three strings @xmath73 and the construction produces a string @xmath66 with large @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "effective procedures that extract the kolmogorov complexity of strings are related to randomness extractors .",
    "these are objects of major interest in computational complexity and there is a long and very active line of research dedicated to them .",
    "a randomness extractor is a procedure ( which , ideally , runs in polynomial time ) that improves the quality of a defective source of randomness .",
    "a source of randomness is modeled by a distribution @xmath6 on @xmath76 , for some @xmath1 , and its quality is modeled by the min - entropy of @xmath6 ( @xmath6 has min - entropy @xmath77 if @xmath78 is the largest probability that @xmath6 assigns to any string in @xmath76 ) . the distribution @xmath6 is defective if its min - entropy is less than @xmath1 , and is perfect if its min - entropy is equal to @xmath1 , which implies that @xmath6 is the uniform distribution on @xmath76 . in many applications , it is desirable to transform a defective distribution @xmath6 into a distribution @xmath79 on a set of shorter strings which is close to the uniform distribution . such a transformation is called a randomness extractor . randomness extraction is not possible from a single source  @xcite , but it is possible from two or more sources  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the research has focused on two types of extractors , seeded extractors and multi - source extractors . a seeded extractor extracts randomness from two independent distributions @xmath6 and @xmath80 , where @xmath6 is defective and defined on the set of @xmath1-bit strings and @xmath80 is perfect and defined on the set of @xmath38-bit strings , with @xmath38 much shorter than @xmath1 ( typically @xmath81 ) .",
    "a @xmath77-multisource extractor takes as input @xmath77 defective distributions on the set of @xmath1-bit strings . for @xmath82 ,",
    "the best multisource extractors are ( a ) the extractor given by raz  @xcite with one source having min - entropy @xmath83 ( for some small @xmath84 ) and the second source having min - entropy polylog(@xmath1 ) , and ( b ) the extractor given by bourgain  @xcite with both sources having min - entropy @xmath85 ( for some small @xmath84 ) .",
    "there is a clear analogy between randomness extractors and procedures that extract kolmogorov complexity . in particular",
    ", the reader may compare results ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) discussed above with existing @xmath86-multisource extractors , but we emphasize that there is a major difference in that extractors run in polynomial time , while the procedures in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are only in expspace . on the other hand , results ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) suggest that it might be possible to construct multisource extractors with sources having a certain level of dependence and/or with the output being random even conditioned by one of the sources .    a few words about the proof technique .",
    "at the highest level , our method follows the structure of the proofs in  @xcite .",
    "one key idea is taken from fortnow et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that a multisource extractor also extracts kolmogorov complexity .",
    "since multisource extractors with the parameters that are needed here are not known to exist , we construct a combinatorial object , called a balanced table , that is similar with a @xmath86-multisource extractor .",
    "a balanced table is a @xmath86-dimensional @xmath87 table with each entry having one of @xmath88 colors such that in each sufficiently large subrectangle all the colors appear approximately the same number of times ( see definition  [ d : balancedtable ] ) . using the probabilistic method",
    ", we show the existence of balanced tables with appropriate parameters .",
    "it follows that such tables can be effectively constructed using exhaustive search .",
    "next , using arguments similiar to those in  @xcite , we show that if @xmath13 and @xmath27 have sufficiently large complexity and sufficiently small dependence , then the color of the entry in row @xmath13 and column @xmath27 of the table has large complexity .",
    "these ideas are sufficient to establish result  ( 2 ) ( theorem  [ t : result2 ] ) .",
    "results ( 1 ) ( theorem  [ t : sequences ] ) and ( 3 ) ( theorem  [ t : result3 ] ) require non - trivial technical refinements of the basic method which are explained in the respective proofs .",

    "therefore , @xmath13 can be described by its rank in this enumeration and by the information needed to perform the enumeration .",
    "it follows that @xmath243 since @xmath244 ( this holds for every @xmath1-bit strings @xmath13 and @xmath27 ) , we obtain @xmath245 which contradicts that @xmath13 and @xmath27 have dependency at most @xmath68 .",
    "we prove that the randomness rate of sequences can be effectively increased even from two sequences having linear dependence .",
    "[ t : sequences ] there exists a truth - table reduction @xmath4 with the following property . for any rational numbers",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath246 , there exists @xmath247 such that for any sequences @xmath13 and @xmath27 with randomness rate at least @xmath34 and dependency at most @xmath61 , @xmath248 has randomness rate at least @xmath249 .",
    "moreover , the reduction @xmath4 is uniform in @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "the plan is as follows .",

    "let @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "the splitting is done in such a way that @xmath257 and @xmath258 have complexity close to @xmath259 and respectively close to @xmath260 even conditioned by @xmath261 .",
    "next , for each @xmath254 , we construct a balanced table @xmath262 with appropriate parameters and take @xmath263 .",
    "the output of the truth - table reduction is the sequence @xmath264 . as in the case of strings",
    ", it follows that @xmath265 has high complexity and actually this holds even conditioned by @xmath266 .",
    "so far , the proof is as in  @xcite .",
    "the point of departure is that in order for the construction to work with inputs having linear dependence , we need to take the length of @xmath265 exponential in @xmath254 ( rather than quadratic in @xmath254 , which was the case in  @xcite ) .",
    "this creates difficulties in showing that every `` intermediate '' prefix of @xmath66 ( @xmath8 , a string that is an extension of @xmath267 and a prefix of @xmath268 , for some @xmath254 ) has high complexity . to handle this , we argue that even prefixes of @xmath265 have relatively high kolmogorov complexity conditioned by @xmath261 ( see lemma  [",
    "l : block ] ) and then the argument for `` intermediate '' strings forks into two cases depending on whether the string is long or short ( see lemma  [ l : combination ] ) .",
    "( sketch . )",
    "the proof is similar to an analogous result from  @xcite . for ( a ) , it is easy to show that @xmath227 can be taken large enough so that the length of @xmath257 is so much larger than the length of @xmath278 that the complexity of @xmath257 does not decrease too much if it is conditioned by @xmath278 .",
    "the parameters satisfy the requirements of lemma  [ l - balancedtable ] and , thus , for each @xmath254 , there exists a table @xmath288 \\times [ n_i ] \\mapping[m_i]$ ] that is @xmath289-balanced . for every @xmath254 , given @xmath254 , a smallest ( in some canonical sense ) such table @xmath262",
    "can be constructed by exhaustive search .",
    "we fix these tables @xmath262 and define @xmath290 and next @xmath264 .",
    "clearly @xmath66 is constructed by a truth - table reduction @xmath4 from input sequences @xmath13 and @xmath27 .",
    "we will show that @xmath66 has randomness rate at least @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath298 , @xmath299 ( by lemma  [ l : b ] ) , @xmath300 , @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "let @xmath238 be the set of entries ( represented by their coordinates in the table ) in the @xmath125 rectangle of the table @xmath262 that have a color with a prefix in @xmath94 . by lemma  [ l - bal - table - refined ] ,",
    "the cardinality of @xmath238 is at most @xmath303 note that @xmath304 belongs to @xmath238 and that @xmath238 can be enumerated given @xmath278 , @xmath199 , and @xmath305 ( observe that @xmath254 can be determined from @xmath278 and thus the table @xmath262 can be constructed )",
    ". therefore @xmath306 can be described by its rank in the enumeration of @xmath238 and by the information needed to perform this enumeration .",
    "this implies @xmath307 on the other hand , by lemma  [ l : b ] , @xmath308 if @xmath254 is large , the last two inequalities conflict each other and we obtain a contradiction .",
    "then @xmath315 .",
    "this implies @xmath316 , because each @xmath317 can be constructed from @xmath318 and @xmath319 . by induction",
    ", it follows that @xmath320 . for the induction step",
    ", the argument goes as follows : @xmath321 in the last step , we have used the fact that @xmath322 and @xmath323 .      for a contradiction , suppose @xmath325 .",
    "note that @xmath326 can be reconstructed from a descriptor of @xmath327 .",
    "this implies @xmath328 but the second term is less than @xmath329 ( due to the choice of @xmath84 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath330 , which , by case 1 , is not possible .",
    "it remains an open issue whether from input sequences @xmath13 and @xmath27 ( even independent ) one can construct a sequence @xmath66 that has high randomness rate conditioned by any one of the input sequences .",
