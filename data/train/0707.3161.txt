    "ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) provide clues to evolution and formation of galaxies .",
    "most of laes are known as star - forming galaxies at @xmath16 with a faint - uv continuum , but a prominent ly@xmath0 emission line , which are produced by star - forming activities with a typical star - formation rate of @xmath17yr@xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "laes are believed to have a negligible fraction of agn activities , since an x - ray detection has been reported for only one lae at @xmath18 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the strong ly@xmath0 emission and a blue uv continuum color imply a young metal - poor star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent infrared observations and population synthesis models indicate that typical stellar mass of laes is as small as @xmath19 and that the stellar age is as young as @xmath20 myr ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "laes show a compact uv morphology with a size smaller than 1 kpc @xcite .",
    "the fraction of laes ( or galaxies with a ly@xmath0 emission line ) increases at faint uv magnitudes @xcite .",
    "these pieces of evidence suggest that lae samples include a young low - mass population at high-@xmath21 .",
    "more interestingly , some of laes have a ly@xmath0 emission line with a large rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath22   that can not be explained by a star - formation with a salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "it is reported that about 10 - 40% of spectroscopically - identified laes have an @xmath23 of @xmath24  at @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the population synthesis models indicate that such large ew objects would have a top heavy imf , a very poor metallicity and/or a very young age@xmath27 yr ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "large - ew objects often show a spatially - extended ly@xmath0 envelope whose projected size can be as large as @xmath28 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "these objects are referred to as ly@xmath0 blobs .",
    "ly@xmath0 blobs are originally discovered in an overdensity region of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath18 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent deep surveys also find ly@xmath0 blobs in blank fields @xcite .",
    "some of these ly@xmath0 blobs show evidence of agn activities @xcite , while others are not @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies predict that these large - ew objects with an extended ly@xmath0 profile are candidates of cooling clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) and population iii galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , which are at the very beginning stage of galaxy formation .",
    "thus , laes are keys to understanding the early stage of galaxy formation with less - massive ( or dwarf ) population some of which include young galaxies even at the very beginning stage of radiating clouds and population iii . the studies of laes complement the recent work of high-@xmath21 massive and/or old galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "laes are usually identified by a redshifted ly@xmath0 emission line that falls in a passband of narrow - band filter ( e.g. @xcite ) , tuned at @xmath29 up to @xmath30 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent blank - field slitless , multi - silt , and ifu spectroscopy also searched for laes @xcite .",
    "blind spectroscopy in cluster regions yielded candidates of gravitationally lensed laes that enable us to study intrinsically faint laes @xcite .",
    "the numbers of photometrically and spectroscopically identified laes are now over several hundreds ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the numbers are increasing by recent and on - going wide - field projects such as wfilas @xcite , musyc @xcite , hawaii ( see @xcite ) , and ssa22 surveys ( nakamura et al . in preparation ) .    in spite of increasing observational data of laes , evolution of laes",
    "is not clearly understood .",
    "most of observational results agree that the lf of ly@xmath0 luminosity shows no evolution at @xmath31 within the errors of measurements .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ; c.f .",
    "although these measurements qualitatively agree , the constraints on the lf evolution are weak , due to the small statistics and field variations .",
    "indeed , the presence of large - scale structures of laes has been reported @xcite at these redshifts , which produce a significant source gradient even within a @xmath32 deg@xmath4 field @xcite .",
    "note that the narrow - band lae studies observe a thin slice ( @xmath33 ) of the universe whose survey volume is about @xmath34 of that of dropout or lbg surveys ( @xmath35 ) at a given search area ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we need to obtain statistical properties of laes including clustering with a good accuracy .",
    "moreover , we should investigate rare populations of laes with a large ew or agn , which are essential for understanding galaxy formation and its relation to the formation of massive black holes .",
    "here we carry out a systematic wide - field narrow - band survey for laes at @xmath36 in the wide - field ( 1 deg @xmath4 ) subaru / xmm - newton deep field ( sxds ) that is covered by deep subaru optical images ( @xmath37=27.0 $ ] ; furusawa in preparation ) and the near - infrared images of ukidss / ultra deep survey ( ukidss / uds ; @xcite ) as well as vla @xcite , xmm - newton ( ueda et al . in preparation ) , and spitzer @xcite . except for the data of @xmath38 laes",
    ", we have completed narrow - band imaging for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 laes . in this paper , we show properties of laes at @xmath39 .",
    "note that the first results from the @xmath26 data have been presented in @xcite .",
    "our systematic survey will not only put strong constraints on properties of laes at @xmath39 , but also give the useful baselines to be compared with higher redshift laes for studying reionization of the universe @xcite .",
    "we show photometric and spectroscopic data , and make the spectroscopic samples in section [ sec : observations ] .",
    "we define the photometric samples of laes in section [ sec : photometric ] .",
    "the agns in our lae samples are presented in section [ sec : multi - wavelength_properties ] .",

    "we discuss our results and summarize them in sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] , respectively .",

    "we carried out narrow - band imaging with subaru / suprime - cam ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) in 7 nights during 2003 september 28 - 30 , october 22 - 24 , and october 26 .",
    "we summarize details of these observations as well as image qualities in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we obtained narrow - band images with three bands , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "we show the response curves of our narrow - band and broad - band filters in figure [ fig : plot_sed_sxdsfilter_paper ] .",
    "these response curves include atmospheric absorption , quantum efficiency , and transmittance of optical elements of the telescope and instrument .",
    "we have chosen these three narrow bands to identify laes at @xmath50 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "note that there are no strong oh sky lines within the passbands of these narrow - band filters ( figure [ fig : plot_sed_sxdsfilter_paper ] ) .",
    "since suprime - cam has a field - of - view ( fov ) of 0.255 deg@xmath4 , the 1 deg@xmath4 area of sxds is covered with 5 pointings of suprime - cam .",
    "these 5 pointings are referred to as sxds - c ( center ) , sxds - n ( north ) , sxds - s ( south ) , sxds - e ( east ) , and sxds - w ( west ) whose central coordinates are the same as the archival broad - band images of the sxds project ( see table 1 of furusawa et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the on - source exposure times of @xmath41 , @xmath44 , and @xmath47 filters are typically @xmath51 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 hours per pointing , respectively .",
    "the observational condition was photometric and clear throughout the first 6 nights , and especially good in three nights for @xmath47 data in 2003 september 28 - 30 .",
    "the seeing size was typically @xmath53 and @xmath54 for 2003 september 28 - 30 , and october 22 - 24 and 26 , respectively .",
    "in addition to these narrow - band data , we use archival data of very deep broad - band ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) images of the sxds project .",
    "the narrow - band data are reduced with the suprime - cam deep field reduction package ( sdfred ; @xcite ) . with the standard parameter sets of sdfred , we perform bias subtraction , flat - fielding , distortion+atmospheric - dispersion corrections , sky subtraction , image alignments , and stacking . before stacking , we mask out bad data areas such as dead pixels and satellite trails .",
    "cosmic rays are removed in the process of stacking with the rejected - mean algorithm .",
    "the @xmath60 sky noise of the reduced narrow - band images are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 in a @xmath64-diameter circular aperture ( see @xcite for the @xmath47 data ) .",
    "typical psf sizes of images after reduction are @xmath65 in fwhm .",
    "we do not use , either contaminated areas with halos of bright stars and ccd blooming or low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) regions located around the edge of the fov , which are caused by dithering .",
    "after we reject these bad areas , the effective total areas are 0.983 , 0.965 , and 1.034 deg@xmath4 for @xmath41 , @xmath44 , and @xmath47 images , respectively .",

    "these standard stars were observed @xmath70 time(s ) , when the sky was thought to be photometric .",
    "we calculate photometric zero - points from photometry of standard stars .",
    "we check these photometric zero points with the narrow- and broad - band images by comparing with colors of stellar objects in our field and 175 galactic stars calculated from spectra given in @xcite .",
    "we find that the colors of stellar objects in our data are consistent with those of @xcite s stars within @xmath71 magnitude .",
    "the photometric - zero points thus obtained are regarded as more accurate than 0.05 mag in the entire 1 deg@xmath4 field .",
    "our narrow - band images are registered to match the coordinates of sxds broad - band images based on hundreds of stellar objects commonly detected in both narrow- and broad - band images .",

    "source detection and photometry are performed using sextractor @xcite .",
    "we measure both mag_auto of sextractor and @xmath64-diameter aperture magnitudes .",
    "we adopt mag_auto as total magnitudes , while we use a @xmath64-diameter aperture magnitude to measure colors of objects in order to obtain colors of faint objects with a good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we make @xmath41- , @xmath44- , and @xmath47-detection catalogs , and limit to @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , respectively , that correspond to about @xmath60 detection limits on a @xmath64-diameter aperture .",

    "we took spectra for objects with colors similar to laes which show a narrow - band excess and a continuum break in blue band .",
    "we observed 128 and 29 objects at @xmath88 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "since we share the mos masks with targets from the other projects , we had tight constraints on our target selection for spectroscopy .",
    "thus , we include unreliable lae candidates with colors similar to foreground objects and very faint narrow - band magnitudes , some of which potentially have a bright ly@xmath0 emission line redshifted to the edge of passband of our narrow band . as a result",
    ", we have identified line emitters from 60% of our targets .",
    "although the success rate of identification is not high by the constraints of our spectroscopy , this target selection allows us to obtain spectra for objects in wide color and magnitude ranges .",
    "in addition to these spectra for our laes , we use the sxds version 1.0 spectroscopic data taken with subaru / focas and aao/2df .",
    "the combination of these and our data provide 3,233 spectroscopic redshifts in our field ( akiyama et al . in preparation ) .",

    "no nebular emission lines enter in the wavelengths of our optical spectra for a @xmath96 [ oii ] emitter . because our spectral resolution is not high enough to clearly identify an [ oii ] doublet",
    ", we examine the possibility of an [ oii ] emitter by the detection of blue continuum in @xmath55 or @xmath56 bands whose @xmath97 upper limits reach very deep magnitudes of @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in this way",

    "we compare colors of galaxies in our lae samples with those of the 3,233 spectroscopically - identified objects which include laes and foreground / background interlopers .",
    "as expected , spectroscopically - identified laes are located in the upper - right part of the two - color diagrams .    based on these color diagrams , we define the selection criteria of three lae samples : @xmath100 \\ \\ \\ \\ { \\rm for\\ { \\it z=3.1}\\ laes},\\ \\ \\\\ \\label{eq : laeselection_nb570 } v - nb570>1.3\\ \\&\\",

    "we include the objects with no detectable continuum in @xmath56 ( for @xmath1 and 3.7 ) and @xmath58 ( for @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , these photometric samples are complete to the narrow - band magnitude limits , which include all the ly@xmath0 emitting objects at these redshifts either with or without a detectable - uv continuum .",
    "the narrow - band excess colors , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , isolate an emission line object at each redshift with a flat continuum ( @xmath108const ) whose rest - frame ew is greater than @xmath109 . note that the actual ew limits for our lae samples are different from @xmath109 , since laes do not have a flat continuum , but a continuum break , i.e. gunn - peterson trough , between blue and red sides of ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "thus , the narrow- and broad - band colors do not provide a clear limit of ews .",
    "we estimate the limits of rest - frame ews to be approximately @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112  for our @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 lae samples with models of our monte - carlo simulations described in section [ sec : ly_alpha_luminosity_functions ] .",

    "our photometric samples do not include spectroscopically - identified laes escaping from the photometric criteria .",
    "figures [ fig : number_density_nb503]-[fig : number_density_nb816 ] show surface densities of laes .",
    "the red circles are the average surface densities .",
    "the black points with 5 different symbols indicate the surface densities in 5 sub - fields ( @xmath113 deg@xmath4 ) of suprime - cam , i.e. , sxds - c , -n , -s , -e , -w .",

    "the difference of surface densities among the five @xmath113 deg@xmath4 fields are negligible for all narrow - band detected objects , but are as large as a factor of , say , @xmath114 , for laes .",
    "these large differences probably come from field - to - field variation as well as poisson errors .",
    "we evaluate the field - to - field variation in our survey area , @xmath115 , with    @xmath116/ \\bar{\\sigma}_{g}^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the rms fluctuation of dark matter in all the survey volume of 1 deg@xmath4 and suprime - cam s 1-fov volume ( @xmath113 deg@xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "we calculate the fluctuations of dark matter with the power spectrum , adopting the transfer function given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath119 is the fluctuation of number density of laes for the 1 fov . @xmath120 and @xmath121 are lae s surface densities of the 1 fov and the average of survey area .    since these estimates of field - to - field variation are based on a large but single contiguous field , it is important to check whether our field is located at the sky of an overdense or underdense region .",
    "in fact , a large - scale overdensity or underdensity of ly@xmath0 sources could also be produced by an inhomogeneous distribution of ly@xmath0 absorbers ( i.e. neutral hydrogen ) along the line of sight .    in figure",
    "[ fig : number_density_nb816 ] we compare the surface densities of our laes with those on completely different sky areas but selected with the same @xmath47 filter by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "moreover , figure [ fig : number_density_nb816 ] shows that shimasaku et al.s and hu et al.s measurements scatter around our average surface - density curve .",
    "thus , we conclude that our single contiguous 1 deg@xmath4 field has no signature of overdensity or underdensity , and that our 5 sub - fields represent the average field - to - field variation .    in the same manner as the calculations of surface densities , figure",
    "[ fig : color_hist_all ] plots color distributions with the uncertainties of field variance for our lae samples . in section [ sec : ly_alpha_luminosity_functions ] , we compare these color distributions ( as well as the surface densities ) with those reproduced by our monte - carlo simulations , and determine the best - estimates of luminosity function by @xmath122 fitting .",
    "first , we estimate the detection completeness of each narrow - band images , @xmath123 , as a function of narrow - band magnitude .",
    "we distribute 7875 artificial objects that mimic laes on our original 1 deg@xmath4 images after adding photon noise , and detect them in the same manner as for the detection of our lae catalogs with sextractor .",
    "we repeat this process 10 times , and compute the detection fraction .",
    "we find that the detection completeness is typically @xmath124% for relatively luminous sources which are 0.75 magnitude brighter than the magnitude cuts of our samples ( i.e. @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 ) .",
    "the detection completeness is @xmath128% even for the faintest magnitude bin of our samples ( i.e. @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 ) .",
    "second , we estimate the contamination of our photometric lae samples , which we need to consider in calculating the lf .",
    "we use our spectroscopic catalog of 3,233 objects ( section [ sec : observations_data_spectroscopiccatalogs ] ) .",
    "we define the contamination fraction , @xmath132 , with @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the numbers of spectroscopically - identified laes and all spectroscopic objects , respectively , lying in our color criteria ( i.e. eqs [ eq : laeselection_nb503]-[eq : laeselection_nb816 ] ) .    since we have spectroscopic objects with no identification ( see section [ sec : observations_data_spectroscopiccatalogs ] ) , we calculate @xmath132 for the following two extreme cases . if we omit the unclear objects , we find @xmath136 for @xmath137 .",
    "note that we see no obvious interlopers in our photometric samples . in case that all the no - identification objects are interlopers , @xmath138 , where we take magnitude cuts of @xmath139 that are bright enough to be completely identified by our spectroscopy .",

    "( ii ) the ew range missed by our selection ( @xmath185 ) is significantly shorter than that of our selection ( @xmath186 ) .",

    "since the @xmath203 ratios change only by @xmath204% between these three estimates , we use the classic @xcite s model .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ fig : lumifun_full_diff_evol_implication ] correspond to the _ intrinsic_-ly@xmath0 lfs that we estimate .",
    "this figure indicates that _ intrinsic_-ly@xmath0 lfs may evolve significantly , and that luminosities and/or number densities of laes are intrinsically brighter / higher at @xmath26 than @xmath1 .",
    "note that we estimate these _",
    "intrinsic_-ly@xmath0 lfs with two assumptions .",
    "the first assumption is that the density of neutral hydrogen atoms in the intervening igm is the cosmic average value at each epoch .",
    "however , hydrogen clouds around laes are likely more ionized by the uv radiation from laes . on the other hand ,",
    "the chance of intervening galaxies with molecular hydrogen probably increases around laes , due to clustering of galaxies .",
    "the second assumption is that the _ intrinsic_-ly@xmath0 emission of laes has a symmetric profile whose central wavelength is not red- or blue - shifted .",
    "@xcite find in a composite spectrum of @xmath205 lbgs that ly@xmath0 emission is redshifted by 360 km s@xmath9 from the average of continuum absorption lines .",
    "because the typical ly@xmath0 fwhm of laes is as small as @xmath206 km s@xmath9 ( e.g. @xcite ) , the igm will absorb only a small fraction of ly@xmath0 photons if they are redshifted by about 360 km s@xmath9 . however , this is true only if ly@xmath0 properties of laes are similar to those of @xmath205 lbgs .",
    "in fact , the typical ly@xmath0 fwhm of laes is smaller than that of @xmath205 lbgs ( @xmath207 km s@xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the velocity offset of ly@xmath0 emission may also be smaller in laes than in lbgs ( 360 km s@xmath9 ) . in this way ,",
    "the inferred _",
    "intrinsic_-ly@xmath0 features ( such as those found in figure [ fig : lumifun_full_diff_evol_implication ] ) are real only if these two assumptions are correct .",
    "we need high - resolution spectroscopy for laes and sophisticated numerical simulations to assess the _ intrinsic_-ly@xmath0 lf , and to derive a reliable conclusion on its evolution .    in summary , it is interesting that _ apparent _ lf of laes does not show a significant evolution over the long redshift range of @xmath1 to @xmath3 .",
    "we point out the possibility that evolution of igm and laes may be tuned to realize this no evolution at @xmath39 , if the amount of external absorption changes with redshift .",
    "we derive the uv lfs of our laes at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we use our lae catalogs , and obtain uv - continuum luminosities from magnitudes of a broad band whose bandpass does not include ly@xmath0 but only continuum emission .",
    "we choose @xmath57 magnitudes for @xmath1 and @xmath2 laes , and @xmath59 magnitudes for @xmath26 laes , where the corresponding wavelengths are @xmath208  in rest frame .",
    "we apply no k - corrections to the uv magnitudes , since the difference of uv magnitudes in this narrow - wavelength range is negligibly small for laes with a flat continuum ( section [ sec : uv_color ] ) .",
    "we calculate number densities from the survey volume and the number counts as a function of uv magnitudes by weighting with the detection completeness ( section [ sec : photometric_lae_completeness ] ) .",
    "note that we need a careful estimation of total magnitudes of broad band .",
    "since the aperture sizes and shapes of mag_auto magnitudes are defined by the sources on the narrow - band images , the mag_auto magnitudes of broad - band images could be contaminated by the neighboring continuum sources .",
    "thus , we identify and deblend sources on our broad - band images with sextractor , and cross - match the broad - band sources with our laes .",
    "if a lae do not have a corresponding broad - band source detected over a @xmath209 level , we just use photometry of a @xmath166-diameter aperture .",
    "we refer to these magnitudes as a total magnitudes of broad band , and derive uv lfs with these magnitudes . for comparison",
    ", we also calculate the lfs from the simple @xmath166-diameter aperture photometry with no completeness correction .",
    "these simple estimates provide lower limits of uv lfs .",
    "figure [ fig : lumifun_uv_diff_evol ] shows the uv - lfs of our laes , together with the previous measurements of laes and dropout galaxies ( or lbgs ) at each redshift .",

    "our lf by the method of @xcite presents a very good agreement with that of @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the aperture corrections defined with @xmath47 band overestimate the broad - band magnitudes .",
    "this is because the ly@xmath0 morphology in the narrow band is generally more extended than uv morphology on the broad band .",

    "most of the previous spectroscopic studies of @xmath58-dropout galaxies suggest that @xmath141% of @xmath58-dropout galaxies down to @xmath222 have a ly@xmath0 emission line with @xmath218 .",
    "it is not clear why our ratio of dropout galaxies and laes is higher than those of spectroscopic results .",
    "there are three possible explanations .",
    "the first is the difference of the definition in the ratio .",
    "we compare the ratio of laes to dropout galaxies at the same redshift , but @xcite and @xcite obtain the ratio of ly@xmath0 emitting dropouts to all the dropouts .",
    "if all the laes are identified by dropout technique , these two ratios should be comparable .",
    "however , laes with no significant continuum are likely missed by the dropout selection . moreover",
    ", the @xmath223 dropout selection systematically misses the strong ly@xmath0 emission lines at @xmath224 .",
    "the selection differences may cause the discrepancy between these two ratios estimated by the different methods .",
    "in fact , the theoretical model of @xcite suggests that lae selections identify more population iii galaxies with a large ew than dropout selections , and that the ew distribution of laes should not be the same as that of dropouts .",
    "the second explanation is that lfs of dropout galaxies have systematic errors .",
    "indeed , we compare the lfs of dropout galaxies of @xcite to estimate the ratio . however , the measurements of dropouts lfs scatter by a factor of 2 or more in the different estimates by various authors .",
    "we show the uncertainties of estimates with the gray shade in figure [ fig : lumifun_uv_diff_evol ] .",
    "the third explanation is the evolution of uv lfs from @xmath225 to @xmath226 as claimed by @xcite .",
    "the uv - lfs of dropout galaxies decrease in number density and/or luminosity from @xmath211 to @xmath189 ( e.g. @xcite ) , and even more significantly evolve from @xmath192 to higher redshifts of @xmath227 @xcite . since @xmath223-dropout galaxy samples distribute over @xmath228 , the lfs of @xmath223-dropout galaxies are measured at higher redshifts in average than that of our laes ( i.e. @xmath26 ) .",
    "this would not allow us to obtain the accurate ratio of ly@xmath0 emitting population to dropout galaxies .",

    "this deficit of uv - bright laes are reported by @xcite at @xmath229 based on the comparison of dropout and lae lfs .",
    "this tendency is also consistent with the results of section [ sec : lya_uv ] and the claims of @xcite who find that uv - bright galaxies do not have a large ly@xmath0 ew from spectroscopic samples at @xmath230 . on the other hand",
    ", this tendency can not be clearly seen for @xmath192 in figure [ fig : lumifun_uv_diff_evol ] , probably due to the large uncertainties of lf of dropout galaxies .",

    "we fit the schechter function with the measurements over a @xmath60 level ( filled circles in figure [ fig : lumifun_uv_diff_evol ] ) .",

    "this implies that at @xmath26 even uv bright galaxies have a detectable ly@xmath0 emission line .",

    "the third explanation is that the fraction of ly@xmath0-absorbed galaxies is lower at higher redshifts , due to an decrease in the amount of hi gas in and around galaxies with redshift .",
    "in fact , some @xmath18 laes show such an hi absorption originating from an inflow and/or outflow in their spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) , although the evolution of such hi clouds has not been observationally understood .",
    "the cdm - based hierarchical model predicts that galaxies at higher redshifts are generally more compact ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the star formation in such compact high-@xmath21 galaxies is so efficient that cold gas is immediately converted into stars .",
    "if high-@xmath21 laes are such compact galaxies , they will have little hi gas and thus their ly@xmath0 emission from hii regions can escape without absorption .",

    "the uv - lfs of dropout galaxies show a significant decrease in luminosity and/or number density from @xmath313 to @xmath192 ( e.g. @xcite ) . in case of luminosity evolution , uv - lfs of dropouts get faint from @xmath18 to @xmath189 by a factor of @xmath314 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "uv - lfs of laes brighten by @xmath195 magnitude , if it comes from the pure luminosity evolution .",

    "( satisfying our color - selection criteria ) , we find that 3 out of 356 @xmath1 laes and 1 out of 101 @xmath68 laes host agns ( section [ sec : lae_hosting_agn ] ) . thus , the fraction of agns is about 1% at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which is consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "note that the detection limits of our laes reach @xmath316 ergs s@xmath9 ( @xmath317 ) .",
    "this agn fraction is the lower limit , since our multi - wavelength data are probably not deep enough to identify faint agns .",
    "we estimate the relation between ly@xmath0 luminosity and the detection limits of our multi - wavelength data . by the comparison of our detection limits and the qso templates in figure [ fig : multiband_sed ] ( see section [ sec : lae_hosting_agn ] for the definition of qso templates ) , our x - ray data likely reach the deepest detection limit for agns among our multi - wavelength data .",
    "we normalize the qso templates to the detection limit of our x - ray data , and measure ly@xmath0 luminosities of the qso templates .",
    "we find ly@xmath0-luminosity limits of @xmath318 and @xmath319 erg s@xmath9 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 objects , respectively , assuming that the sed of agn - laes is the same as the qso templates . down to these ly@xmath0-luminosity limits",
    ", we find 3 out of 25 ( 1 out of 8) photometrically selected laes have an agn at @xmath1 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "thus , the agn fraction is estimated to be @xmath183% down to @xmath320 erg s@xmath9 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 laes .",
    "this ly@xmath0-luminosity limit corresponds to @xmath321 .",
    "note that the agn fraction of laes is as small as 10% even with this bright detection limit of ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "if we take a ly@xmath0 limit for the very bright luminosity of @xmath322 and @xmath323 erg s@xmath9 in our @xmath1 and @xmath2 samples , respectively , all of laes ( 2 out of 2 laes and 1 out of 1 lae at @xmath1 and 3.7 ) have agn activities .",
    "these very bright limits correspond to the brightest bins of our lf in figure [ fig : lumifun_full_diff_evol ] ( see section [ sec : ly_alpha_luminosity_functions ] ) .",
    "there appear possible humps of lf at @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are produced by the agn - laes .",
    "the number density in these brightest bins is about @xmath324 mpc@xmath178 .",
    "thus , a shallow wide - field lae survey generally finds this agn - lae population .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have obtained the fraction of agns in their @xmath205 lbg samples down to @xmath325 with optical spectra .",
    "they have found the agn fraction of 3% for their lbg sample with a relatively faint continuum limit of @xmath325 .",
    "since the detection limits of this study is different from ours , we can not directly compare the agn fraction of their lbgs and our laes .",
    "since we find the agn fraction ( and its lower limit ) of our laes is 10% ( and @xmath326% ) for our @xmath321 ( and the entire [ @xmath317 ] ) samples , the agn fraction of laes and lbgs would be comparable .    for @xmath26 laes , we identify no agn with our spectra or multi - wavelength data . in the same manner as the calculations above",
    ", we estimate a ly@xmath0 detection limit of @xmath26 laes that corresponds to the x - ray luminosity limit with the qso templates .",
    "we find that the ly@xmath0 detection limit is @xmath328 erg s@xmath9 , but we have no laes with @xmath329 erg s@xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "there are two agn - laes that are brighter than @xmath328 erg s@xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath322 erg s@xmath9 ) at @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it may imply that laes with a bright agn such found at @xmath205 would disappear at @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , no agn signatures such as nv emission have been confirmed in spectra of the brightest @xmath26 laes that are found in other wide - field studies @xcite .",
    "no detection of agn in @xmath26 laes implies that the number density of laes with agn activities would drop from @xmath205 to @xmath3 .",
    "recent qso surveys have measured qso luminosity functions accurately , and found that the space density of bright qsos with @xmath330 decreases from @xmath205 to 6 by more than an order of magnitude ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this trend is the same as that of our finding in our lae samples . because our agn - laes are as faint as @xmath331 , our agn - laes probe for evolution of relatively faint agn .",
    "thus , evolution of faint agns appears to follow the evolution of qsos .",
    "this faint - agn evolution implies that not only bright qsos but also faint agns can provide less significant contribution than star - forming galaxies for reionizing the universe at @xmath332 . in other words , uv radiation from star formation",
    "likely becomes more dominant than that from faint agns at @xmath192 .      in section [ sec : multi - wavelength_properties ] ,",
    "we have identified agns with our multi - wavelength data .",
    "the multi - wavelength data are too shallow to identify star - forming activities at high redshifts .",
    "the limiting sfrs of our multi - wavelength are as large as @xmath333 for our x - ray and @xmath149 m data and @xmath334 for our radio data , respectively .",
    "however , we find that our radio data provide a meaningful limit on sfr of our laes by stacking analysis .",
    "we exclude laes with an individual radio detection , and stack radio images of our photometrically selected laes in the same manner as @xcite .",
    "the stacked images show no detection in the radio band .",
    "the @xmath209-upper limits of the stacked images are @xmath335 @xmath83jy for our @xmath255 laes .",
    "the relationship between sfr and radio luminosity ( @xmath336 ) is given by @xmath337 for high - mass stars ( @xmath338 ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , where @xmath339 is the frequency and @xmath0 is the non - thermal ratio spectral index ( @xmath340 ) . assuming this sfr v.s .",
    "radio - luminosity relation , we obtain @xmath209 upper limits of @xmath341 @xmath342 for our @xmath255 laes .",
    "thus , the average sfrs of laes are smaller than @xmath220 and @xmath343 @xmath342 at @xmath1 and @xmath344 , respectively .",
    "the result of our @xmath26 laes is similar to that of @xcite who report the @xmath97 upper limit of @xmath345 @xmath83jy ( i.e. @xmath346 @xmath342 ) for their stacked radio image of @xmath26 laes in cosmos field .",
    "the upper limits of radio sfr are consistent with the sfrs of typical ( @xmath11 ) laes , @xmath347 ( section [ sec : evolution ] ) , estimated from uv and ly@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "this agreement between radio and optical sfrs implies that majority of laes are not associated with dusty starbursts with significant ( @xmath348 ) hidden star - formation .",
    "it is consistent with the fact that no laes are detected in submm bands ( section [ sec : sub - mm_properties ] ) .",
    "these results support the small - dust extinction of laes from the blue uv - continuum color ( section [ sec : implications_blue_continuum ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "no significant excess of radio sfr may reject the possibility of an extremely - top heavy initial mass function for star - formation of laes , since radio fluxes are originated from non - thermal radiation of supernovae at the final stage of massive stars .",
    "no radio detections in the stacked images also suggest that typical laes do not harbor low - luminosity radio agns at @xmath39 ( see also @xcite for @xmath26 laes ) .",
    "the radio fluxes of our agn - laes are @xmath349jy ( table [ tab : multi - wavelength_prop ] ) at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while our @xmath209 upper limits of stacked images are @xmath350jy .",
    "thus , typical laes do not have a low - luminosity radio agn whose flux is brighter than @xmath351 of typical radio agn - laes at @xmath212 .",
    "figure [ fig : corr_muv_ew0_all ] shows that uv - bright ( @xmath290 ) galaxies do not have a large @xmath23 ( @xmath291 ) at @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite suggest that uv - bright galaxies are a dusty and chemically - evolved population , and that such uv - bright galaxies do not have a large ew .",
    "there are two other possibilities to explain this trend .",
    "first , the average stellar population of uv - bright galaxies would be older than that of uv - faint galaxies .",
    "since ly@xmath0 emission can be efficiently produced by hard - uv continuum from early - type stars , galaxies can emit a strong ly@xmath0 emission of @xmath352  within @xmath183 myr after a starburst @xcite .",
    "second , hi clouds of inter - stellar medium or inflows may be rich in uv bright population , and absorb a ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "it is likely that the combination of age , neutral hydrogen , dust , and metallicity makes the deficit of large ew galaxies at bright uv magnitude .",
    "we find that uv - continuum colors of laes are bluer than those of dropout galaxies in section [ sec : uv_color ] .",
    "this implies that laes are less - dusty and/or younger population than dropout galaxies .",
    "although more detailed analysis with near - infrared data and population synthesis models will be presented in ono et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , we compare the uv - continuum colors of laes with a simple model .",
    "@xcite have obtained the relation between @xmath292 color and dust extinction , @xmath353 , with the stellar population synthesis model @xcite and the extinction law @xcite which reproduce a typical uv - optical sed of dropout galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "the relation of color and dust extinction is , @xmath354 @xcite also confirm that this relation agrees with the one of local starbursts .",
    "this relation assumes that the difference of uv color ( or uv slope ) is caused by dust extinction , since the model fixes the age , metallicity , initial mass function , and star - formation history .",
    "we apply this simple model to our laes in figure [ fig : corr_muv_contcolor_all ] .",
    "figure [ fig : corr_muv_contcolor_all ] implies that laes have an extinction of @xmath355 , while that dropout galaxies typically have @xmath356 .",
    "there are some very blue laes whose uv colors scatter around @xmath357 .",
    "the colors of these objects are still comparable to the color of @xmath358 within a @xmath359 level . however ,",
    "if this very blue uv color is true , the colors of laes can be explained not only by extinction , but also by stellar population that is bluer than that of typical dropout galaxies .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath353 of @xmath1 laes with the independent approach , i.e. the comparison of uv and ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "they have obtained @xmath360 , which is consistent with ours .",
    "we have made a photometric sample of 858 lae candidates and a spectroscopic sample of 84 confirmed laes at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 down to @xmath361 erg s@xmath9 in a 1 deg@xmath4 sky of the subaru xmm - newton deep survey field .",
    "based on these samples , we have studied photometric and spectroscopic properties with the aid of multi - wavelength data from x - ray to radio .",
    "the major findings of our study are summarized below .",
    "we derive the lf of ly@xmath0 emission for each redshift and provide the best - fit schechter parameters as summarized in table 5 , by carefully taking into account the statistical error and the field - to - field variation .",
    "we find that the _ apparent _ ly@xmath0 lf shows no significant evolution between @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "evolution , if any , is limited within factors of 1.8 and 2.7 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "although no evolution of the ly@xmath0 lf over @xmath362 has already been suggested by previous studies , we now have much stronger and more reliable constraints with smaller systematic and statistical errors .",
    "since the average ly@xmath0 opacity of the igm is larger at earlier epochs , the absence of evolution in the apparent ly@xmath0 lf implies an intrinsic brightening of ly@xmath0 luminosity with increasing redshift being canceled out by increasing absorption of the igm .",
    "we note , however , that this claim is true only if the two assumptions made in section [ sec : evolution_of_lya_lf ] are correct .",
    "the lf of uv continuum for laes shows an increase in number density and/or uv luminosity from @xmath235 to @xmath3 .",
    "this evolution of the uv lf is consistent with the plausible evolution in the _ intrinsic _ ly@xmath0 lf , since we find that the distribution of the rest - frame _ intrinsic _ ew of laes does not change or positively evolves with redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "the uv lf of dropout galaxies is known to show an opposite evolutionary trend to that of laes , namely , a decrease in number density and/or uv luminosity with increasing redshift .",
    "this implies that the ratio in number density of laes to dropout galaxies increases from @xmath235 to @xmath3 , and that galaxies with ly@xmath0 emission are more common at earlier epochs .",
    "we identify six laes ( in total ) with agn activities . in our photometric sample ,",
    "three out of 356 @xmath1 laes and one out of 101 @xmath68 laes host agns .",
    "thus , the lower limit of the agn fraction down to @xmath316 erg s@xmath9 ( @xmath317 ) is @xmath13% at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we use qso templates given in the literature to find that @xmath363 of laes are agns above the ly@xmath0 luminosity where our sample is complete , @xmath320 erg s@xmath9 ( @xmath321 ) .",
    "it is notable that 100% of laes ( 2 out of 2 laes and 1 out of 1 lae at @xmath1 and 3.7 ) host agns at the bright end of the lf with @xmath322 and @xmath323 erg s@xmath9 at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "shallow and wide - field narrow - band imaging would be an efficient way to search for laes hosting agns .",
    "we obtain the @xmath209 upper limits of stacked radio images , @xmath335 @xmath83jy for our @xmath255 laes .",
    "these upper limits indicate @xmath341 @xmath342 at @xmath255 based on the sfr - radio luminosity relation of @xcite .",
    "these upper limits are consistent with the sfrs estimated from ly@xmath0 and uv luminosities .",
    "thus , the majority of laes are not associated with dusty starbursts with significant ( @xmath348 ) hidden star - forming activities .",
    "no radio detections in the stacked images also indicate that typical laes do not harbor a low - luminosity radio agn at @xmath39 . at @xmath212 , typical laes do not have a low - luminosity radio agn whose flux is brighter than @xmath351 of typical radio agn - laes of our sxds field .",
    "we find a deficit of large - ew galaxies with bright uv continuum emission at all three redshifts .",
    "this finding not only confirms the previous results of @xcite for @xmath205 and @xmath365 , but also claims that this trend is common in the early universe .",
    "this deficit is probably caused by a combination of old ages and large amount of neutral hydrogen , dust , and metallicity in uv - bright galaxies .",
    "the uv - continuum colors of laes are generally bluer than those of dropout galaxies at the same uv luminosity .",
    "if we assume that laes have the same stellar population as dropout galaxies , then the uv spectral slope of laes indicates @xmath355 .",
    "the very blue laes probably have extremely low dust extinction and/or very young stellar populations .",
    "we stack the spectra of the confirmed laes to estimate the @xmath209 upper limit of @xmath15 to be @xmath366 for @xmath1 and @xmath309 for @xmath68 .",
