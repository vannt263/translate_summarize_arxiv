    "existence and properties of closed geodesics on riemannian manifolds have been subject of intense research since poincar s work @xcite from the beginning of the 20th century . a prominent result in the field",

    "for instance , on a plane with two singular points of cone angle @xmath2 which is otherwise flat , curves of minimal length that enclose both @xmath1-neighborhoods converge to a straight segment between the singular points .    to prove our result we first reduce its statement to the case of simply connected spindle orbifolds ( see section [ sec : pre ] ) . using the curve - shortening flow we are able to prove the existence of an embedded geodesic in the regular part of any simply connected spindle orbifold and to apply ideas from bangert s proof and frank s result in this case .",
    "our proof relies on the observation that embedded loops in the regular part that evolve under the curve - shortening flow either stay in the regular part forever , or collapse into a singular point in finite time ( see section [ sec : curve_shortening ] ) .",
