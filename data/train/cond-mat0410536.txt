    "exploring spin liquid has been a recurrent theme in the research of strongly correlated electron systems over the past decades dagotto96,npb0,npb1,shen98,wen02,sachdev03,senthil04,batista04 .",
    "the picture for spin liquid is based on the concept of resonating valence bonds ( rvb ) , which says all spins form spin singlet pairs anderson73,anderson2,anderson3 .",
    "spin singlet pairs consist of either nearest neighboring spins or long - range separated spins .",
    "quantum coherence of spin singlets determines the quantum properties of the state .",
    "it is realized that a short - range rvb state usually exhibits a finite gap for spin excitations @xcite , while a long - range rvb state possesses antiferromagnetic long - range order ( lro ) @xcite . nowadays",
    "a lot of systems are found to exhibit the behaviors of spin liquid .",
    "one route to explore spin liquid is to focus on geometrically frustrated spin systems or systems with breaking translational invariance .",
    "the formers include the kagome lattice model and the @xmath1 model .",
    "the latters include the spin peierls systems and the plaquette rvb systems . in these systems",
    "the quantum and/or geometric frustration is the key point to realize spin liquid .",
    "another route is to deal with a series of low - dimensional spin systems with haldane gap or the spin systems with orbital degeneracy which enhances quantum frustration .",
    "such systems neither break the translational invariance nor exhibit geometrical frustration .    in this paper",
    "we propose a class of quantum frustrated su(@xmath0 ) models for quantum magnets , and develop a mean field theory for the spin liquid involved in it .",
    "the models are constructed by the su(@xmath0 ) generators , but has no su(@xmath0 ) symmetry because of the competition between the generators in two different representations . for small @xmath0",
    "it is shown that these models are equivalent to several physical models which have been extensively studied , and fall into the same mathematical structures in the particle representation . to explore the spin liquid a mean field theory based on the rvb state is developed . in two dimension ( @xmath2 )",
    "it is found that the ground states for @xmath3 and @xmath4 are gapless spin liquid and the collective excitations are dirac particles . as examples we apply the theory to spin 1 bilinear - biquadratic system and spin @xmath5 systems with double orbital degeneracy .",
    "let s start from a class of hamiltonian @xmath6which is defined on a lattice .",
    "@xmath7 are the @xmath8 generators of su(@xmath0 ) group , and satisfy the algebra @xmath9 = \\delta _ { ij}\\left ( \\delta _ { \\nu } ^{\\alpha } j_{\\beta } ^{\\mu } ( r_{i})-\\delta _ { \\beta } ^{\\mu } j_{\\nu } ^{\\alpha } ( r_{i})\\right ) .\\]]we choose @xmath7 as the fundamental representation with a single box in young tableau . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two coupling constants .    the first term in eq.([general ] ) possesses the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry because the operator , @xmath12 , serves as the permutation operator , which swaps two quantum states at sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this term in various forms has been studied extensively . the case for @xmath15 is the well known heisenberg model , which was solved exactly and exhibits a gapless ground state in one dimension ( @xmath16 ) @xcite . while in higher dimensions it is well established that the ground state possesses antiferromagnetic lro on hypercubic lattices .",
    "the case for @xmath3 was known as the exchange model for ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "for @xmath17 it was proposed that a spin liquid exists on the triangular lattice @xcite , but a schwinger boson theory gives a state with lro @xcite .    the second term in eq.([general ] )",
    "also has the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry on a bipartite lattice , which means that @xmath11 connects two lattice sites belonging to two different sublattices arovas88,read90,santoro99,zhang01,zhang2,harada03 . in this case",
    "the generators at two sublattice sites are expressed in conjugate representations since @xmath18 ^{\\dag } $ ] , and thus the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry survives . in @xmath16 the ground state",
    "is gaped for @xmath17 . in @xmath2 ,",
    "the ground states are found to exhibit the nel - type lro with broken su(@xmath0 ) symmetry for @xmath19 , and possibly to be a spin liquid for @xmath20 santoro99,zhang01,zhang2,harada03 .",
    "the mixture of the two terms makes the whole hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( general ) deviate from the two su(@xmath0 ) symmetries .",
    "we propose that this symmetric frustration may also lead to spin liquid .",
    "to study the phase diagram of the model in eq.([general ] ) we introduce a set of creation and annihilation operators to rewrite the hamiltonian in the second quantization representation . in the su(@xmath0 ) representation each site has @xmath0  quantum states @xmath21 so that we may introduce @xmath0 pairs of operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 with the vacuum state @xmath25 at site @xmath13 . in this way we can construct the operator , @xmath26 , with a constraint for single occupancy , @xmath27 , on each site .",
    "this is the so - called hard - core condition even if the particles are bosons .",
    "interestingly it is found that the generators satisfy the su(@xmath0 ) algebra in eq .",
    "( 2 ) for either boson or fermion representation .",
    "so the hamiltonian is reduced to @xmath28where the bond pairing operator @xmath29 and the lagrangian multipliers @xmath30 are introduced to realize the constraint of single occupancy .",

    "alternatively we present the spin - orbital model @xcite ,    @xmath69    with spin  @xmath70 and orbital @xmath71 , where both of the operators , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , satisfy the su(2 ) algebra .",
    "this model was used extensively to describe the orbital physics in transition metal oxides tokura00 . at @xmath74",
    "the model has the su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "there are four simultaneous eigenstates for spin @xmath75 and @xmath76 at each site , @xmath77 .",
    "so we introduce four creation operators as follows ,    @xmath78    by introducing a four component spinor @xmath79 , we can express the spin and orbital operators in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,    @xmath82    once again one can show that the spin - orbital model falls into the general form of hamiltonian as eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "so far we have shown that the three physical models can be expressed in a general form in terms of su(@xmath0 ) generators as eq.(1 ) or in the particle representation as eq .",
    "( 2 ) . for larger @xmath0 ,",
    "the models are related to some high spin systems with orbital degeneracy , for example , the spin-1 system with double orbital degeneracy @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the phase diagram of the model on a @xmath85-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "we may choose the operators , @xmath44 s , as either bosons , @xmath86=\\delta _",
    "{ ij}\\delta _ { \\mu \\nu } $ ] , or fermions , @xmath87 . in principle",
    "the bosons tend to condensate to the lowest energy state at low temperatures and to form a quantum ordered state , while the fermions tend to form a fermi sea and a quantum disordered states . in practice",
    "it is inevitable to introduce adequate approximation schemes to deal with a many - body system in either the bose or fermion representation .",
    "since our purpose is to search the regime of the spin liquid phase , we choose the fermion representation in this paper . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the system is defined on a @xmath85-dimensional simple cubic lattice , and take @xmath88 .",
    "in this way the hamiltonian is semi - negative in the fermi representation .",
    "now the second term in eq.([general ] ) plays a role of an attractive interaction between pairing valence bonds.zhang01 the hubbard - stratonovich transformation is performed to decouple the hamiltonian into a bilinear form .",

    "we have @xmath0 degenerate spectra for quasi - fermions .",
    "these are not the collective modes , and can not be measured explicitly . in order to calculate spin susceptibility we define the matsubara green s function in the form of a @xmath109 matrix ,    @xmath110    where the bracket @xmath93 means that the thermodynamic average is made , and the factor @xmath111 is the imaginary time order operator .",
    "the green s function of the frequency is obtained as follows , @xmath112where @xmath113 for all integer @xmath114 . due to the degeneracy of the spectra",

    "the energy gap @xmath124 can be evaluated by solving the mean field equations .",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath125 or @xmath126 the spectra for fermions are reduced to an ideal fermion gas . in the case",

    "when @xmath11 increases a non - zero solution for @xmath106 and @xmath105 is obtained .",
    "we take @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 for finite @xmath130 the mean field equations are solved numerically at @xmath121 . in one dimensional case a finite gap is found in a large regime of the parameter space . in this paper we focus on @xmath2 systems .",
    "numerical solution for non - zero @xmath106 and @xmath105 has lower energy than other mean field solutions with @xmath131 or @xmath126 when @xmath132 for @xmath3 and @xmath133 for @xmath17 .",
    "opposite to the @xmath16 cases non - zero @xmath106 and @xmath105 do not produce an gaped phase .",
    "instead they lead to a gapless spin liquid with @xmath134 .",
    "notice that along the line @xmath135 , we have @xmath136 . and on this line if @xmath137 the spectrum becomes @xmath138 .",
    "so we get the solution , @xmath139numerical values of the parameters show that @xmath140 always holds for the mean field solution .",
    "@xmath141 is plotted in fig .",
    "1 . in other words ,",
    "the fermi surface actually consists of two points located at @xmath142 .",
    "we expand the dispersion relation near the fermi point @xmath143 with    @xmath144    the spectrum becomes linear with respect to @xmath145    @xmath146    where the anisotropic velocity is @xmath147with @xmath148 and@xmath149 the dispersion relation is linear and the quasiparticles are type of dirac particles .",
    "its velocity is in general anisotropic and has its minimal for @xmath150 and its maximal for @xmath151 for a specific @xmath152 . at @xmath153 for @xmath3 and @xmath154 for @xmath17",
    "the velocity becomes _",
    "isotropic_. beyond the regime in fig .",
    "1 we do not anticipate the present mean field theory is still valid because it is already known that the long - range order exists in the ground state in @xmath2 when @xmath155 @xcite .    we have also calculated the static correlation function @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we found that the results for the two systems are very similar .",
    "so we only present the results for @xmath17 here . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the diagonal susceptibility , @xmath159 , for different couplings .",
    "all values of @xmath160 are convergent , which indicates the absence of long - range order as expected in a spin liquid state .",
    "we observe that @xmath161 has its maximal value at points ( @xmath162 ) for small @xmath152 ( or @xmath10 ) , which shows the static antiferromagnetic correlation dominates .",
    "the maximal values decrease with the increasing @xmath152 ( from fig .",
    "2(a ) to 2(b ) ) , and @xmath163 becomes almost flat for large @xmath152 .",
    "in fig.3 , we plot the off - diagonal @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "we found that the maximal value of @xmath161 changes from the points ( @xmath162 ) to ( 0,0 ) with @xmath152 increasing .",
    "thus the antiferromagnetic correlation decreases very quickly , and the  ferromagnetic correlation dominates at large @xmath152 . for an intermediate @xmath152 either the diagonal or the off - diagonal @xmath161 has a relatively flat structure , which implies that the state is a very well - defined spin liquid .",
    "though the mean field theory has lots of disadvantages , it is still used extensively to study the many body system with strong correlation after some adequate transformations . until present",
    "there has no definite conclusion on whether the @xmath2 su(@xmath0 ) ( @xmath164 ) antiferromagnetic model with @xmath165 and @xmath166 possesses lro ground state @xcite .",
    "in the present mean field theory it is assumed that the ground state is a spin liquid in the case .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulation may provide helpful information .",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath2 spin 1 bilinear - biquadratic model in eq .",
    "( [ spin-1 ] ) was studied numerically for @xmath167 harada02 .",
    "it is found that the ground state is antiferromagnetic for @xmath168 , which corresponds to the regime @xmath169 for @xmath170 in fig .",
    "1 . as there lacks data in the regime @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) ( @xmath173 ) the numerical calculation does not exclude possible existence of spin liquid in the case of @xmath88 though the antiferromagnetic fluctuations may be very strong .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a class of frustrated su(@xmath0 ) models for quantum magnets based on the generators of su(@xmath0 ) group , and showed that several physical models have the same mathematical structure in the fermion or boson representation .",
    "the model we constructed breaks su(@xmath0 ) symmetry when @xmath10 and @xmath11 are non - zero simultaneously , although the two parts in the model do have different su(@xmath0 ) symmetries , respectively . usually geometric quantum frustration on lattices or coupling structures",
    "is one of the main driving forces to generate spin liquid .",
    "the mixture of two parts with different su(@xmath0 ) symmetries provides us a possibly new way to seek for spin liquid in higher dimensions . in this paper a mean field theory with paired valence bonds for quasi - particles is developed to explore this kind of spin liquid .",
    "a gapless spin liquid exists in a large extent regime in two dimension .",
    "it is believed that the mechanism of the spin liquid is the competition of two interactions with different su(@xmath0 ) symmetries .",
