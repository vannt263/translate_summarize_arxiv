    "the higgs boson search is underway at the lhc .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) has already been constrained to be between 115 gev and 127 gev or to be higher than 600 gev at the 95% confidence level by the recent direct search results  @xcite . by the combination with the electroweak precision measurement at the lep  @xcite and the slc  @xcite",
    ", we may expect that a light higgs boson exists as long as the higgs boson interactions are of sm - like and that it will be discovered in near future .",
    "the sm is expected to be replaced by a new model at higher energies above the tev scale , which may give reasonable explanations for tiny neutrino masses  @xcite , the origin of dark matter  @xcite and the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the low energy effective theory of such a more fundamental model often contains a non - minimal higgs sector .",
    "the structure of a higgs sector strongly depends on the property of the corresponding new physics model at the high energy scale , so that experimental reconstruction of the higgs sector is extremely important to determine new paradigm for physics beyond the sm .",
    "once a higgs boson is found at the lhc , its properties such as the mass , the width and the decay branching ratios will be thoroughly measured as precisely as possible . the precision measurement for higgs boson properties",
    "can also be performed at future linear colliders such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) and the compact linear collider ( clic ) .",
    "each extended higgs model will be tested by preparing the full set of theoretical predictions on the observables which will be precisely measured at experiments at these colliders .",
    "the electroweak rho parameter has been one of the most important experimental hints to select possible structures of extended higgs sectors .",
    "its experimental value ( @xmath11 ) would indicate that the higgs sector is composed of one or more doublet fields ( or with singlet fields ) .",
    "such models naturally predict @xmath12 at the tree level because of the custodial symmetry in the kinetic term of their higgs sectors .",
    "radiative corrections give the deviation from unity corresponding to the violation of the custodial symmetry in the physics of dynamics in the loop  @xcite . on the other hand , as another possibility",
    ", we may consider with some physics motivations the other class of higgs models which contain scalar fields of larger representations under the @xmath13 gauge symmetry , in which @xmath14 is predicted at the tree level . in these models ,",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of such fields with large isospin representations are highly constrained to be much smaller than 246 gev to satisfy @xmath15 .",
    "the higgs triplet model ( htm ) is one of the examples which predict @xmath16 at the tree level . in the htm , a higgs triplet field with the hypercharge @xmath0",
    "is added to the minimal model with a higgs doublet field with @xmath17 .",
    "the htm can explain the tiny neutrino masses in a simple way via the so - called type ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the htm is the existence of doubly - charged higgs bosons in addition to singly - charged as well as extra neutral bosons , all of which are components of the triplet field .    in this paper",
    ", we study radiative corrections to the electroweak observables in the htm . in the model with @xmath16 at the tree level like the htm ,",
    "apart from the models with only doublet fields and singlets which predict @xmath12 at the tree level , a new input parameter has to be introduced in addition to the usual three input parameters such as ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the on - shell renormalization scheme is constructed in the higgs model with the @xmath18 triplet field , in which four input electroweak parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are chosen to describe all the other electroweak observables .",
    "the radiative corrections to the electroweak observables have been calculated in the @xmath18 triplet model  @xcite and in the left - right symmetric model  @xcite .    in our analysis ,",
    "we first define the on - shell renormalization scheme for the electroweak sector of the htm by using the method in ref .",
    "we then calculate radiative corrections to the electroweak observables such as @xmath19 and @xmath20 as a function of the four input parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) htm .",
    "however , the renormalization scheme they used seems to be only valid in models with @xmath12 at the tree level . ] .",
    "we examine the preferable values of the mass spectrum of the triplet - like higgs bosons and the vev of the triplet field under the constraint from the electroweak precision data .",
    "we find that the hierarchical mass spectrum with large mass splitting is favored especially for the case of @xmath9 @xmath10 , where @xmath9 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the masses of the cp - odd ( @xmath7 ) , cp - even ( @xmath8 ) , singly - charged ( @xmath24 ) and doubly - charged ( @xmath5 ) higgs bosons , respectively , which mainly come from the components of the triplet field . on the contrary ,",
    "the inverted hierarchical case with @xmath25 @xmath26 is relatively disfavored , in particular for the light sm - like higgs boson .",
    "we then discuss implication with the higgs boson phenomenology at the lhc in the htm  @xcite .",
    "the deviation due to the quantum effect of doubly- and singly - charged higgs bosons is evaluated on the decay rate of @xmath27  @xcite , where @xmath28 is the sm - like higgs boson .",

    "the deviation from the sm prediction can be significant although it is destructive .",
