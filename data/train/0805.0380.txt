    "the sierpinski gasekt is a fractal in @xmath0 constructed in the following way .",
    "start with an equilateral triangle of side 1 .",
    "divide it into 4 equilateral triangles of side 1/2 , and retire the central triangle .",
    "repeat this procedure on each of the three remaining triangles .",
    "after @xmath1 steps , we are left with @xmath2 small triangles of side @xmath3 . since this sequence of triangles is decreasing , and each element in the sequence is compact , there is a non - viod limiting set @xmath4 .",
    "we call this set @xmath4 the _ sierpinski gasket_.    at each step of this construction , consider the boundary of the resulting set as a graph @xmath5 in @xmath0 , with @xmath6 vertices and @xmath7 bonds .",
    "consider now a system of particles evolving on this graph .",
    "the particles are attempting jumps to neighboring sites at rates that depend only on the number of particles sharing the same site .",
    "this is the so - called zero - range process .",
    "such a system has been extensively studied in the usual lattice @xmath8 or its periodic version ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study the collective behavior of this system as the graph get finer and finer , approximating in this way the sierpinski gasket @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in the _ hydrodynamic limit _ of the model , that is , the macroscopic evolution of the density of particles .",
    "it turns out that the hydrodynamic limit for this model is given by a nonlinear heat equation of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the laplacian defined in @xmath4 and @xmath11 depends on the particular form of the interaction between particles . in a private communication",
    ", we have obtained gaussian fluctuations for the hydrodynamic limit , in the stationary situation .    at first sight",
    ", this result does not appear surprising , since the hydrodynamic equation for the zero - range process in the usual lattice @xmath8 is also given by teh same nonlinear heat equation .",
    "however , the sierpinski gasket @xmath4 is a fractal , and therefore it does not have a differentiable structure . by this reason ,",
    "even the definition of the laplacian @xmath10 in @xmath4 is subtle . in @xcite , barlow and perkins",
    "have defined a brownian motion in @xmath4 as the scaling limit of the simple random walks defined in @xmath5 . as a by - product",
    ", they have defined the laplacian @xmath10 in @xmath4 as the generator of this brownian motion .",
    "a purely analytical definition can be found in the book by kigami @xcite .",
    "one remarkable fact is that the scaling limit is _ subdiffusive _ , in the sense that the scaling factor , which is equal to @xmath12 in this case , is larger than the square of the mesh of the graph , which is @xmath13 .",
    "this fact leads to anomalous diffusion properties of the corresponding heat equation , and to the failure of the usual gaussian estimates on the decay to equilibrium of solutions of the heat equation .",
    "although very detailed information about the fundamental solutions of @xmath14 in @xmath4 has been obtained @xcite , up to our knowledge existence and uniqueness of the cauchy problem for the hydrodynamic equation @xmath15 have not been considered in the literature .",
    "we provide in this article the existence and uniqueness results for the cauchy problem in @xmath4 that we need to make sense of the hydrodynamic limit for the zero - range process .",
    "although collateral to our work on the zero - range process , these results could be of independent interest .    from the point of view of interacting particle systems ,",
    "the zero - range process is an example of a process satisfying the _ gradient condition_. roughly speaking , the current of particles is the gradient of another local function ( the interaction rate , in this case ) .",
    "therefore , fick s law is satisfied at a microscopic level .",
    "the classical method to deal with the hydrodynamic limit of gradient systems was introduced in @xcite and it is based on the so - called _ one - block _ and _ two - blocks _ estimates .",
    "unfortunatedly , the two - blocks estimate does not seem to hold for the sierpinski gasket .",
    "in fact , this two - blocks estimate is based on the _ moving particle lemma _ , which states that a particle can be moved from one site to another with a diffusive entropy cost .",
    "the laplacian @xmath10 satisfies a poincar inequality in @xmath4 , and therefore , the spectral gap for the associated particle system is expected to be of the right order . however , in the sierpinski gasket there are _ hot spots _ , that is , sites of the graph that have to be visited in order to connect two different regions of the graph .",
    "in particular , it is not true that the best strategy in order to transport a particle from one site to another is just to follow the shortest path , in contrast with the situation in the integer lattice .",
    "probably the simplest method to prove hydrodynamic limits of gradient systems is the @xmath16-norm method , due to chang and yau @xcite ( see @xcite for a more readable exposition ) .",
    "the advantage of this method is that only requires the one - block estimate ; its main drawback is that it works only for diffusive systems without a drift term .",
    "the idea of this method is very simple : let @xmath17 , @xmath18 be two solutions of the hydrodynamic equation .",
    "then , the time derivative of @xmath19 is equal to @xmath20 and in particular , it is decreasing .",
    "therefore , if @xmath21 , then @xmath22 for any @xmath23 .",
    "the point is that this relation holds also at a microscopic level .",
    "however , at the microscopic level and for non - transitive graphs , there is a correction term involving @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the green function associated to @xmath10 . for the laplacian in subsets of @xmath26 , @xmath27 may not be well defined , but anyway @xmath28 can be defined , since the singularity of @xmath27 at the diagonal is always of the same magnitude , and cancels , at least in a weak sense , when taking the laplacian as the limit of averaged differences around @xmath29 .",
    "this is not the situation in the sierpinski gasket @xmath4 .",
    "we will see that , despite the fact that the green function is continuous in @xmath30 , the function @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 , in a sense to be precised later .",
    "this nonregularity of the green function poses an extra difficulty to the proof of the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "usually , the one - block estimate allows us to replace a local function of the number of particles by averages over small boxes , _ when averaged with respect to a continuous test function_. in our case , we need to average it with respect to discrete approximations of @xmath33 , with we have seen that is not continuous . therefore , the one - block estimate needs to be proved without averaging with respect to test functions .",
    "this has been accomplished only recently @xcite .",
    "the proof however , confines us to dimension @xmath34 .",
    "fortunately , the sierpinski gasket has hausdorff dimension @xmath35 , and the so - called _ local _ one - block estimate holds in our case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s1 ] , we define the laplacian operator in @xmath4 and we review some aspects of functional analysis on @xmath4 that will be needed in the sequel . in particular , we define with some detail the green function @xmath36 associated to the dirichlet laplacian in @xmath4 . although most of the material of this section has been taken from @xcite , @xcite , we have decided to include most of the proofs for the convenience of readers interested in interacting particle systems , not familiar with analysis on fractals .",
    "in section [ s2 ] we define what we understand by a weak solution of the hydrodynamic equation @xmath37 and we prove existence and uniqueness of such solutions by considering a finite - difference numerical scheme to approximate those solutions .    in section [ s3 ]",
    "we introduce the zero - range process , the @xmath16-norm method and we prove the hydrodynamic limit for the zero - range process , relying on the one - block estimate and suitable properties of the green function @xmath36 . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we prove the one - block estimate and the lemmas needed for the derivation of the hydrodynamic limit . in the appendix we study the behavior of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 corresponds to the discrete approximation of @xmath10 defined in @xmath5 .",
    "the results presented in the appendix are not needed for the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "ee have included them here to stress that the example of the sierpinski gasket is the worst possible case for the derivation of the hydrodynamic limit with the @xmath16-norm method .",
    "we believe that the ideas presented here can be adapted to treat general non - homogeneous graphs , like random graphs and trees , percolation clusters and disordered lattices .    we have organized the paper in such a way that sections [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] are independent",
    ". therefore , the readers interested in the zero - range process can take for granted the existence and uniqueness results for the hydrodynamic equation and jump directly from section [ s1 ] to section [ s3 ] .",
