    "the extended radio morphologies in extragalactic radio sources manifest in a variety of structures . however , a basic double - lobed structure is invariably present and is accepted as fundamental to the nature of these radio sources . among the various departures from this basic structure ,",
    "radio galaxies with x - shaped morphologies have staked claim to the bizarre .",
    "apart from the usual double lobes , prototypical x - shaped radio sources have a second pair of lobes  sometimes larger than the main lobe pair  sharing the same radio core but oriented along a vastly different axis . some of the most impressive examples of this class of x - shaped radio galaxies are 4c12.03 , 3c223.1 , 3c315 and 3c403 @xcite",
    ".    extended powerful radio sources typically has hotspots at the ends of the lobe pair , and diffuse emission extending from the hotspots towards the core , often forming a continuous bridge of relatively lower surface brightness .",
    "@xcite studied and classified distortions to normal bridge structures : they were found to be quite common , occurring in as many as @xmath1 of sources , and the distortions occurred predominantly at the centres with either one or both lobes deflecting off the radio axis .",
    "these lobe deviations at the centres were suggested to be a consequence of interaction between the strong backflows and a gaseous halo associated with the host galaxy .",
    "inversion symmetry in the central distortions involved backflow material encountering an asymmetrically distributed galaxy halo .",
    "the large deviations observed in x - shaped radio sources were suggested as resulting from a deflection of backflowing material into a cavity created by past activity along a very different direction .",
    "recent phenomenological studies of the extended emission associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have provided additional clues to the genesis of the radio morphologies .",
    "@xcite presented evidence for a preference for x - shaped radio galaxies to be hosted by galaxies with relatively high ellipticities and for the lobe deflections to be oriented close to the host minor axes . based on their findings a model for formation of x - shaped structures was proferred wherein backflows occurring closer to host major axes responded to the high cocoon pressure by escaping along the direction of maximum pressure gradient , which is along the host galaxy minor axis . while the latter finding of the ` wings ' being preferentially along host minor axes has been subsequently confirmed , observational support for the stringent requirement for high host ellipticities has not been forthcoming @xcite . supporting this model ,",
    "x - ray emission corresponding to a thermal gaseous halo has been detected in the host of an x - shaped radio source 3c403 : the highly elliptic x - ray contours of the halo follow the elliptic galaxy isophotes and appear tangential to the sharp bend in the radio contours of the backflow , suggesting a deflection interaction @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented an interesting case of a giant , fr - i type @xcite x - shaped radio galaxy that obeys the same empirical relations found by @xcite for fr - ii x - shaped sources .",
    "the discovery of its restarted nature via the finding of an inner , edge - brightened double source sharing the same core and radio axis suggests a model consistent with the backflow scenario .    in an attempt to account for the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) observations of anomalous spectral indices in the twin lobes ,",
    "@xcite proposed that the x - shapes originated in two closely spaced agns where each was associated with a pair of lobes whose radio axes are at a large angle with respect to each other .    on the other hand , considering the observational evidence for episodic activity associated with the agns in several radio sources @xcite , the obvious question is whether x - shaped radio sources are a result of a restarting of beams following a flip in the ejection axis @xcite . this alternative model  the binary black - hole merger model ",
    "suggests the eventual merger of two black holes , one of which is responsible for the radio jets , as causing a rapid flip in the spin axis resulting in a new double radio source along a very different axis .",
    "this is the preferred model for the multi - frequency observations of two x - shaped radio galaxies presented by @xcite , and for the double - peaked low - ionization emission lines observed by @xcite in an x - shaped source .",
    "the existence of wings that are larger than the main source extent has been viewed as an argument against the backflow model @xcite ; such structures are accounted for in the black - hole merger model as relic emission from an independent past activity epoch , which may have been ongoing for longer time compared to the current actvity .",
    "however , as has been pointed out by @xcite , it is possible , within the backflow model , for a very asymmetrical environment and fast backflows to result in wings advancing faster than the main lobe .",
    "we take up the issue of the formation of x - shaped structures in this paper , expanding the discussion to the formation of off - axis deformations that are less spectacular , and including the question of formation of giant radio galaxies .",
    "we first discuss the place of fr - i x - shaped sources in section  2 .",
    "we then explore the relationships between the radio axis and host galaxy major axis for several samples , in sections  3 to 6 , representing different radio morphological structures .",
    "we find evidence that a variety of radio morphological features might be a result of interactions between the jets , backflows , and an asymmetric environment , and the discussion in section  7 consolidates the viewpoint that the radio morphologies are related to whether the source is of the minor- or major - axis class , as defined by the relationship between the radio axis and optical axes . at the outset",
    "we define an x - shaped source to be one that has extensions on either side of the core in addition to the main lobes , with at least one extension having a total extent more than @xmath2 of the main lobe ; such extensions are referred to herein as ` wings ' .",
    "extensions that are less than @xmath2 of the corresponding lobes are called ` mini - wings ' .",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with hubble constant @xmath3 = 71  km  sec@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 and matter density parameter @xmath5 = 0.27 .",
    "x - shaped structures are almost always found in edge - brightened radio sources .",
    "this aspect has been an important clue to the cause of the x - shaped structures , and has been used to argue for or against models proposed for the formation of the x - structures .    in models that require backflows and invoke deflection of backflowing lobe material for the creation of the prominent wings , edge - brightened radio structures  indicative of powerful jets and compact hotspots  are necessary . in this class of models fr - i sources",
    "would not be expected to show x - shaped structures . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of fr - i x - shaped sources has been viewed as a puzzle or attributed to negligible interaction between the black hole binary and radiatively inefficient accretion disks in fr - is @xcite .",
    "it has also been used as an argument against models in which the wings are relics of past activity , which was along a different position angle @xcite .",
    "this belief that x - shaped radio sources are exclusively edge - brightened and hot - spot radio galaxies  owing to the lack of observations of x structures in edge - darkened radio sources  has been dented by the recent discovery and imaging of the clearly fr - i x - shaped radio galaxy b2014@xmath6558 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we have carefully examined x - shaped radio galaxies in the literature and have identified several more examples , which have either edge - darkened lobes or edge - brightened lobes that lack hotspots .",
    "examples of fr - i type edge - darkened x - shaped sources , or x - shaped sources lacking hotspots at the ends , are considered a clear argument against models that require backflows for the formation of the secondary radio axis .",
    "since the sources we have identified have no hotspots at the ends of their lobes , backflows are not expected .",
    "therefore , it would appear that their secondary radio axes could not have formed via the deflection of backflows , suggesting that x - shaped structures  at least in such cases  might form via flips in the radio ejection axis .",
    "below , we list and provide brief notes on the x - shaped radio galaxies that we have identified to have edge - darkened lobes , or lacking hotspots at their lobe ends .",
    "all of these have secondary radio structures or ` wings ' that are at least 50% of the extent of the main radio axis .",
    "\\(1 ) b2014@xmath6558 :  a study of the radio properties of this unusual fr - i x - shaped radio galaxy has been presented by @xcite . to our knowledge , it is the first clearly fr - i type x - shaped radio galaxy to be recognized as such and studied in detail .",
    "the source is atypical in more than one aspect .",
    "it is the only known giant radio source with the classic x - structure .",
    "as discovered by @xcite , b2014@xmath6558 is also a double - double radio source and has an inner double at the centre , aligned with the 1.5-mpc outer lobes , and nearly two orders of magnitude smaller in linear extent .",
    "\\(2 ) 4c12.03 :  although the radio source appears to have an edge - brightened morphology , the lobes do not possess compact hotspots at the ends @xcite .",
    "4c12.03 has one of the most prominent set of wings among known x - shaped radio sources : the wings span an extent that is larger than that of the main radio axis .",
    "once again , the radio source is of the double - double category and has an embedded inner double at the centre , with extent about 30  kpc , that is observed to be collinear with the main lobes .",
    "\\(3 ) 3c315 :  this is a well studied x - shaped radio source @xcite with clearly edge - darkened lobes , although the northern lobe has a warm - spot located somewhat away from the end .",
    "there are no compact hotspots in either of the two main lobes . apart from the relaxed appearance for the lobes along the main axis and the lack of hot spots , which are unusual in x - shaped radio sources",
    ", 3c315 appears to possess a relatively small , inner edge - brightened double radio source at the centre as in the previous two cases presented above .",
    "the inner - double is about 8  kpc in extent and is closely aligned with the axis of the main source ( 3crr atlas , eds . j. p. leahy , a. h. bridle , r. g. strom ) .",
    "\\(4 ) j0116@xmath6473 :  @xcite presented a detailed study of this radio source , pointing out that it has a double - double structure and is a spectacular example of recurrent nuclear activity in which new edge - brightened inner lobes have been created embedded within outer edge - brightened relic lobes of past activity ; the outer lobes lack hotspots .",
    "additionally , they drew attention to a peculiar distinct bar - like feature that is associated with the inner part of the southern lobe and offset from the core , and is oriented almost orthogonal to the radio source axis .",
    "if we consider this bar as a ` wing ' then j0116@xmath6473 is another example of a restarting x - shaped radio galaxy that lacks hotspots at the lobe ends .",
    "\\(5 ) b1531 + 104 :  this source has been observed by @xcite and is a radio source in an abell cluster .",
    "the source has wings that are asymmetric in extent : the eastern wing is less than half the extent of the western wing .",
    "there are no hotspots in both of the main pair of lobes . as in previous examples listed above , b1531 + 104",
    "is observed to have an inner double structure that constitutes all of the bright structure in the source and is aligned with the main axis as defined by the main pair of lobes .",
    "\\(6 ) b1207 + 722 :  this source is also a member of an abell cluster and was imaged by @xcite .",
    "the observations clearly show a pair of wings centered on the core .",
    "the two main lobes have their brightest regions well recessed from the lobe ends ; this attribute is more manifest for the northern lobe .",
    "\\(7 ) ngc  326 :  radio images of this source have been presented by @xcite , and it has been noted that both of the pair of main lobes lack compact hotspots at their ends .",
    "the wings in ngc  326 are among the most spectacular of such structures : they are more than twice the main source in extent .",
    "the host is part of a dumb - bell galaxy pair .",
    "\\(8 ) 3c76.1 :  this source has a clear edge - darkened morphology although a pair of warm - spots are present at the lobe ends @xcite .",
    "the source lacks the classic bright pair of jets ; instead , it has a nested pair of emission peaks on either side of the core .",
    "the s - shaped morphology of the main axis suggests that the jet may have precessed over a small angle .",
    "the source has a wide wing that is centred on the host galaxy .    for each of the above eight sources we have measured the sky angle between the radio axis , as defined by the main pair of radio lobes , and the major axis of the host galaxy .",
    "this has been relatively error free in six cases ( b2014@xmath6558 , 4c12.03 , 3c315 , j0116@xmath6473 , b1207 + 722 and 3c76.1 ) in which the host galaxy images are clearly non - circular .",
    "it is significant that in all of these six cases the radio axis is oriented close to the major axis of the host galaxy , and the relative angle between the radio axis and major axis of the host is within @xmath7 .",
    "the sources have been selected based on the radio morphology , with no bias related to the host optical properties and , therefore , we believe that our result is a finding of a genuine propensity .",
    "it is remarkable that all of the six x - shaped radio sources that lack hotspots at the ends  with some , additionally , having edge - darkened lobes ",
    "show the same alignment between the main radio axis and the major axis of the host galaxy as was reported by @xcite for fr - ii x - shaped radio sources . moreover , in all six cases with clearly non - circular hosts , the wing - lobe pairs lie on the same side of their host galaxy major axis , suggesting that the wings are a result of interactions of backflow from the corresponding lobe and an asymmetric environment associated with the host galaxy .",
    "although it may seem that the discovery of the above edge - darkened and hotspot - less x - shaped sources might be evidence against the backflow model for the creation of wings in at least this class of sources , the alignment of the main radio axis with the optical major axis in these cases as well indicates that there may be a unified model across x - shaped sources with and without hotspots .",
    "a clue is our remarkable finding that the radio images of five of the eight sources listed above clearly show evidence for an inner double  they are double - double radio sources  and are presumably undergoing a renewal of central engine activity with new edge - brightened lobes aligned with the main outer lobes . in this picture",
    "the main lobes in all these cases are relics of past activity , which would likely have been of edge - brightened hotspot type if the beams in the past activity were the same as that at the present .",
    "we are led to believe that the x - shaped radio sources of the edge - darkened type and those that lack hotspots in their relaxed lobes have relic main lobes , which were created by powerful beams in the past .",
    "the relic main lobes , together with the wings , might have been created in that previous activity phase , with the wings a consequence of interaction of backflows with the host galaxy environment as in the backflow model .",
    "if the backflow model is applicable for all x - shaped radio sources with and without hotspots , this would require that the large - scale radio structure in all hotspot - less x - shaped radio sources are relics of past activity that was in the form of hot - spot radio sources .",
    "additionally , this hypothesis also suggests a conversion from edge - brightened to edge - darkened morphology when the central beams of hot - spot radio galaxies are turned off , at least in those cases where backflows are strong and the beams are directed along the major axis of the optical host .",
    "it may be noted that none of the above sources , which are hotspot - less and edge - darkened x - shaped radio sources , have radio powers significantly below the fr - i / fr - ii break , consistent with the hypothesis that they are actually relics of objects with hotspots .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , as projected on the sky , fr - ii x - shaped radio galaxies tend to have their main radio axis aligned closer to the major axis of the host elliptical galaxy . as we suggest in the previous section , x - shaped radio galaxies that lack hotspots and with fr - i type edge - darkened morphology",
    "do exist and also follow this trend .",
    "x - shaped radio galaxies are a small fraction of extended radio sources associated with agns , and it is of interest to examine whether subsets of the parent population , which exhibit other specific morphological features , also show similar preferences in the orientation of their main radio axis relative to the projected axes of the host , and whether relationships exist between morphological parameterizations and the radio - optical misalignment angle .",
    "the results of several previous searches for correlations between the orientations of the radio axes and the host galaxy major or minor axes have been varied .",
    "some early authors , for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , all failed to find any correlations .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite found a preference for the orientation of the radio axis along the host minor axis ; moreover , the tendency for this alignment was stronger for larger ( @xmath8  kpc ) radio sources .",
    "@xcite ruled out large misalignment angles ( @xmath9 ) between the radio axes and the minor axes of their hosts .",
    "@xcite examined the radio - optical axis relations in a large sample of sources for which they obtained optical ccd images using the 1.5-m la silla and radio images with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "they report a lack of any correlation of the radio axes with the projected optical axes as well as intrinsic stellar axes .",
    "more recently , the searches for correlations have been extended to examining for differences in correlations amongst subsets of the radio galaxy population : for example , @xcite find a greater preference for fr - ii type radio sources to lie closer to the host minor axis , as compared to fr - i type sources , and the correlation was reported to be stronger for radio sources with higher axial ratios .    in this section",
    ", we revisit this issue by examining the 3crr sample for relationships between radio morphological properties and the relative orientation ( @xmath10 ) between the radio axis and projected major axis of the host elliptical .",
    "this sample has the advantage of systematic , precision hst observations with uniform quality , as well as exhaustive radio observations available in the literature .",
    "we used the 3crr sub - sample @xcite that included only the nearby ( @xmath11 ) radio sources ( the so - called atlas sample of j.  p. leahy , a.  h. bridle and r.  g. strom ) .",
    "these sources have been observed at radio wavelengths with high sensitivity to extended low - surface brightness components and the sample is well suited for examining for preferences in @xmath12pa related to radio morphology .",
    "the radio axes were measured from fits images available in the 3crr atlas website , using detections of core , hotspots and jets to define the radio position angle ( p.a . ) .",
    "the orientation of the projected major axes of the optical hosts were taken primarily from the tabulations in @xcite and @xcite , who have derived the p.a . from hst images . in all cases",
    "we also examined their optical images by eye and if the tabulated value and the apparent p.a . of the optical image appeared inconsistent , or if a source was not included in the tabulations , we ( i ) used the 1.6-@xmath13 m fits images downloaded from the hst archives , where available , and measured the p.a .",
    "of the elliptical isophotes , and ( ii ) in certain cases we used the fits images from the digitized sky survey or 2mass survey repository . in each case",
    "we also cross - checked against the body of observational results cited in the literature for consistency ; a most useful reference work was the hst observations reported by @xcite and the issac - newton telescope ( int ) data of @xcite .",
    "the p.a . and",
    "ellipticity values adopted for each galaxy refer to the largest scale structure in the optical images ; a similar approach was adopted by @xcite for their tabulations .",
    "the measurements were based on isophotes that were well above noise and mostly on linear scales of several kiloparsec . the p.a . from independent observations and images and using different data , where available , were found to be consistent and usually within @xmath14 . in cases where isophotal twists confused the issue , we adopted determinations based on the outer isophotes of hst archival images .",
    "the basic data used in the analysis presented herein is in table  1 .    in fig .  1 we show the distribution of @xmath15 for the whole sample of 3crr fr - ii sources .",
    "the sources are distributed over the range 090@xmath16 in their orientations relative to the host major axes and appear to show no preference for orientation closer to the host major or minor axis .",
    "this is similar to that reported by several previous studies ( using ground based data prior to the hst ) .    considering only the 61 3crr fr - ii radio galaxies",
    ", the median linear size is 284  kpc and the median p.a .",
    "offset of the radio axis from the optical major axis is @xmath17 .",
    "2 shows the plot of median projected linear size of the 3crr fr - ii sources binned in intervals of @xmath15 .",
    "the median linear size appears to increase systematically with radio - optical p.a .",
    "sources with radio p.a . within @xmath7 of the optical major axis have median linear size @xmath18  kpc , whereas the sources with radio p.a .",
    "more than @xmath7 away from the optical major axis have median linear size of @xmath19  kpc ; the errors in the medians have been determined here , as well as hereinafter , usng the efron bootstrap method .",
    "we have compared the distributions of the linear sizes of the major axis sources ( @xmath20 ) with the linear sizes of the minor axis sources ( @xmath21 ) using the non - parametric wilcoxon - mann - whitney test .",
    "the probability that the major axis sources could have a chance distribution in linear sizes as small as that observed is 6.5% , suggesting that the two distributions are genuinely different : the population of minor - axis sources have larger linear sizes as compared to the population of major - axis sources .",
    "it is interesting that when the sample is binned in @xmath22 ranges , the bin containing sources with radio axes within @xmath22 of the minor axis stands out with 4 giant radio galaxies with linear size exceeding 700  kpc , whereas the remaining three bins do not contain more than two giant sources each .",
    "the binomial probability of obtaining four or more giants , of the total of 7 giants in the sample , by chance is 7% suggesting that our finding of a preference for giant radio sources to lie close to the host minor axis may be genuine .",
    "such a minor - axis preference for giant radio galaxies was reported in earlier studies of @xcite and @xcite .    interestingly , although not large in projected linear size , all the three relaxed - double radio sources in the 3crr sample ( 3c310 , 3c314.1 and 3c386 ) have radio axes within @xmath22 of the minor axis ; they are all less than about 400  kpc in size .",
    "the sample of 3crr radio galaxies with fr - ii morphological classification , has 10 giant radio sources with projected linear size exceeding 700  kpc ( 3c33.1 , 3c35 , 3c46 , 3c223 , 3c236 , 3c274.1 , 3c326 , 3c457 , 4c73.08 , da240 ) .",
    "of these ten , two have host galaxies with circular shapes ( 3c46 and 3c274.1 ) and for one source ( 3c457 ) we could not locate useful optical images in the literature or repositories .",
    "the remaining seven giant radio sources , for which the radio - optical p.a . may be reliably measured , have a median p.a .",
    "offset between the radio axis and the host minor axis of @xmath23 ( the one standard deviation upper limit to this offset is @xmath24 ) .",
    "four out of the seven giant radio sources have their radio axes within @xmath25 of the host minor axis , and an interesting aspect of the radio morphologies of these large radio galaxies is the complete absence of ` winged ' structures ; we will return to this point later below .",
    "the 3crr fr - ii sources , with linear sizes below 700  kpc , have a median offset of @xmath26 from the major axis .",
    "it appears that jets in larger radio sources are observed to be preferentially oriented closer to the minor axis of the hosts ; additionally , sources close to the minor axes of elliptical galaxies tend to have larger linear sizes .",
    "radio jets may be uniformly distributed in radio - optical p.a .",
    "offset ; however , it appears that radio jets that propagate closer to the host minor axis result in larger radio sources as compared to jets that emerge closer to the host major axis .",

    "the source has wings in both lobes , but only one wing is close to the host galaxy . while the southern lobe extends west close to the location of the host , the extension in the northern lobe towards east occurs well away from the host .",
    "the radio axis is close to the major axis of the host : @xmath27 is just @xmath25 .",
    "examination of the optical field shows a close neighbour at the location where the wing associated with the northern lobe appears to deflect east .",
    "the coincidence between the bend in radio structure and sky location of the companion galaxy is suggestive of a model wherein the backflow from the northern lobe is deflected by a gaseous halo associated with the neighbouring galaxy .",
    "if sources with prominent wings in their lobes are preferentially oriented close to their host major axes , it is of interest to examine the morphologies of radio sources that are , instead , oriented close to their host minor axis .",

    "this sample of minor - axis radio sources includes five giant radio sources .",
    "this examination of the sub - sample of 13 minor - axis sources that have radio axes aligned close to their host minor axes reveals that most are devoid of wings  including any scaled down manifestations of wing distortions or mini - wings  in their lobes .",

    "sixteen fr - ii - type radio galaxies ( 3c67 , 3c200 , 3c28 , 3c436 , 3c173.1 , 3c401 , 3c268.3 , 3c299 , 3c61.1 , 3c33.1 , 3c433 , da240 , 3c388 , 3c42 , 3c300 and 3c123 ) were identified in the 3crr sample , which have radio axes within @xmath32 of their host major axes .",
    "the median linear size of this major - axis source sample is just @xmath34  kpc .",
    "half of the sources have mini - wings , wings or plume structures associated with their lobes and five ( 3c28 , 3c401 , 3c61.1 , 3c433 and 3c123 ) of these eight display prominent wings .",
    "however , it may be noted that some of these major - axis sources have no wings ( 3c436 , 3c173.1 and 3c33.1 ) and some have large emissions gaps between their cores and lobes ( 3c299 , 3c268.3 and 3c67 ) .",
    "there is only one giant radio galaxy , da240 , in this restricted sample ; although da240 does not have lobe distortions such as wings or mini - wings , both its lobes have unusually small axial ratios ( ratio of the lobe extent along the radio axis , from core to the end , to the transverse width of the lobe ) , and are individually nearly circular in morphology .",
    "to conclude this section , there appears to be two classes of radio galaxies : major - axis and minor - axis sources that have differing radio structures and different median linear sizes .",

    "offsets in the 1-jy sample of giant radio galaxies of @xcite , restricting to the sub - sample of redshift @xmath35 objects for which optical images that have sufficient quality for the reliable determination of p.a.s exist . the sub - sample consists of 17 giant radio galaxies ( grgs ) with projected sizes exceeding 700  kpc",
    "; five of these are members of the 3crr sample .",
    "the methodology adopted for estimating the radio and optical p.a.s was the same as for the 3crr sample .",
    "three sources ( b0050 + 402 , b0658 + 490 and b2147 + 816 ) had poor optical images and were rejected ; of the remainder , one host galaxy ( b1309 + 412 ) had a shape close to circular and was also omitted for the analyses that required @xmath12pas .    we derive a median offset of @xmath36 between the radio axis and host minor axis for the reduced sample of 13 grgs with @xmath37 and size @xmath38  kpc ; as many as 11 of the 13 have radio axis within @xmath31 of the host minor axis .",
    "the median radio - optical p.a . offset for the 3crr giant radio galaxies ( with size @xmath38  kpc ) is consistent , within errors , with the value obtained for this grg sample ; additionally , it may be noted that the omission of the five 3crr giants from this grg sample does not change the computed median .",
    "the analysis of the 3crr sample indicated that relatively few grgs manifested large wings . to explore this issue for a larger sample",

    "we examined their radio images for off - axis lobe distortions close to the centre : off - axis plumes with extent @xmath40 of the associated lobes are referred to herein as ` wings ' ; those @xmath41 of their associated lobes are referred to as ` mini - wings ' .",
    "a large fraction ( @xmath42 ) of the giant radio galaxies in this compilation do not have wings .",
    "only 3 ( 4c73.08 , b0114@xmath6476 and b0511@xmath6305 ) of the 52 have extensions resembling wings , and in all of these sources the wings are in only one of the pair of lobes .",
    "one source , 3c46 , has a pair of mini - wings and another three ( 3c274.1 , b0211@xmath6471 and b1545@xmath6321 ) have mini - wings on only one side .",
    "clearly wings of the kinds seen in x - shaped radio galaxies are not present . if we restrict to only the 18 well - imaged sources  the 3crr giants and those in the compilation of @xcite  we find that 11 do not have wings , 3 have wings ( only in one lobe ) , 3 have mini - wings ( only in one lobe ) and one has a pair of mini - wings , confirming the relative paucity of wings in grgs that was inferred for the larger compilation .",
    "to examine the relationship between the radio axes and host optical axes for a larger sample of grgs , we used the combined sample , but restricted to sources for which relatively good optical data is available : ( a ) the 11 3crr grg hosts for 10 of which hst images are available , ( b ) an additional 9 sources in the @xcite sample of nearby @xmath37 1-jy giants ( excluding the 5 common to 3crr ) , for which sufficiently good dss or 2mass images were available , and ( c ) 4 of the 7 grgs from the @xcite sample for which anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) imaging observations or supercosmos digitized images with sufficient quality were available .",
    "our measurements were checked against images and notes from various publications in the literature . in all there were 24 sources : table  2 lists the members from the @xmath37 1-jy @xcite sample ( including the 5 common to 3crr ) and the 4 from @xcite sample ; the six members that are part of the 3crr nearby sample are in table  1 .",
    "five grgs ( 3c46 , 3c274.1 , b0511@xmath6305 , b1545@xmath6321 and b1309 + 412 ) were associated with hosts with apparently circular images and one ( 3c457 ) had only a poor optical image and , consequently , host p.a.s could not be reliably estimated for these .",
    "3 shows the histogram of the @xmath12pa distribution for the 18 grgs with non - circular hosts and for which optical - axis p.a.s could be determined ; a clear preference for minor axis orientation is seen . among these 18 grgs ,",

    "all the 12 grgs with radio axis close to the host minor axis lack central extensions : both wings and mini - wings .",
    "several of these grgs show emission gaps ; what is noteworthy is that in every case where the lobe emission extends all the way to the central core no wings or mini - wings are apparent in the radio images ( e.g. 3c35 , 3c223 and b0309 + 411 ) . in the 6 grgs with radio axis more than 30@xmath16",

    "the few grgs with radio axes oriented away from the minor axes of their hosts are relatively abundant in extended wings and mini - wings .",
    "in this section the distribution of radio - optical p.a . offsets in x - shaped radio sources are examined and relationships between the source morphology and radio - optical p.a .",
    "offset are studied .",
    "a total of 31 x - shaped radio sources have been compiled from the literature .",
    "selection criteria adopted were : ( a ) presence of off - axis lobe distortions at the end of the lobe closer to the core , which exceed 50% of the length of the associated lobe , ( b ) the distortion ought to be asymmetric with respect to the main source axis , and ( c ) the off - axis distortion must be present in at least one of the lobes in the pair .",
    "these criteria exclude the numerous sources with mini - wings . to the list of known x - shaped radio sources compiled by @xcite ( see his table  1 ) we added sources from the 3crr sample and from the abell clusters imaged by @xcite , which were recognized as satisfying the criteria for x - shaped structure .",
    "there are two quasars in the compilation .",
    "the total radio powers span a wide range from @xmath44 to @xmath45  w  hz@xmath4 . our sample is more than three times larger than the sample used by @xcite in their study of the distribution in radio - optical p.a .",
    "offset .",
    "x - shaped radio galaxies are believed to be exclusively associated with fr - ii type radio sources @xcite . however , in our compilation of 31 sources we identify as many as 8 that are either edge - darkened or lack hotspots at the lobe ends despite being edge - brightened .",
    "all have been described above in section 2 along with a discussion on the implications for the backflow model for x - shaped radio sources .    in table  3",
    "we list parameters for our sample of x - shaped radio sources . for deriving the p.a.s of the main radio axis we adopted the same method we used  and described above  for the 3crr sources . for obtaining p.a.s for the optical hosts : in the case of 3crr sources we used the values derived above ; for the remaining sources the optical p.a.s were measured on the dss or supercosmos images at a surface brightness level at least three times above rms noise .",
    "we expect measurement errors to be less than @xmath14 . for measurement of p.a .",
    "of the radio wings we mostly used the p.a . of the central ridge line of individual wings .",
    "the wings in a pair of lobes are usually parallel , although the wings are often not collinear ; in a few cases ( 3c315 and 3c403 ) we adopted the mean p.a .",
    "for the two wings and in cases where only one wing was well defined its p.a . was used .",
    "fig .  4 , which shows the distribution in p.a .",
    "of the main radio axes and wings for our sample , reveals that the main radio axes in x - shaped radio sources are all oriented within @xmath46 of their host major axis with median offset of @xmath47 . the fig .",
    "4 also shows the different distributions in the p.a .",
    "offsets for the wings compared to the main radio axes : whereas the main radio axes are fairly uniformly distributed over offsets in the range 050@xmath16 of the host major axes , and only two sources have main radio axes within @xmath14 of the host major axes , the wings are preferentially close to the host minor axes and as many as 8 have wings within @xmath14 of their host minor axis .",
    "the probability that the different distributions for the orientations of the main sources and the wings occurs by chance is @xmath48% based on the wilcoxon - mann - whitney test .",
    "if we exclude the two quasars and sources with faint or unidentified or circular host galaxies , we have 10 sources whose wings are within @xmath14 of the minor axis of their hosts and 9 sources with wings making larger angles .",
    "these distributions imply that although the main radio axis might be somewhat offset from the host major axis , the wings tend to align along the host minor axis .",
    "these confirm the work of @xcite .",
    "5 shows a plot of the ratio of projected extents of wing to main source versus source size .",
    "the two quasars ( 4c01.30 and j2347 + 0852 ) have large wings relative to their main radio axes , as would be expected because their main radio axes would be foreshortened by projection effects .",
    "considering the radio galaxies in the sample , the median projected wing - to - main - lobe ratio shows no evidence for a trend with projected linear size : the median value of this ratio is @xmath49 .",
    "the distribution over this ratio appears to have a long tail towards large values of the wing - to - main - lobe ratio .",
    "5 suggests that sources with relatively larger projected linear size , including giant radio sources , are lacking in examples of sources with large wing - to - main - lobe ratio .",
    "such a trend is consistent with a picture wherein asymmetry in galaxy environment results in larger sources being minor - axis sources with poorer backflows and off - axis distortions in their lobes . however , because of the small size of the sample it is difficult to correct for projection effects , which may be partly responsible for this trend .    the scatter plot in fig .  6 , showing the distribution in radio power versus the p.a . of the wings",
    "relative to the major axis of the host , is indicative of a weak link between the orientation of the wings with respect to the host major axis and the source total radio power ( correlation coefficient between the wing position angle and the logarithm of the total radio power is 0.55 ) .",
    "the x - shaped radio sources in which the wings are well away from the host minor axis are the ones with relatively lower total radio power , and the more powerful x - shaped radio sources tend to have wings along the host minor axes .",
    "although their main radio axes might make angles of as much as @xmath46 to the host major axes , as is the case for 4c12.03 , 3c403 and b2356@xmath6611 , these powerful sources continue to have minor axis wings .    in fig .",
    "we show the distribution of the ellipticity of the host galaxies of x - shaped sources compared to that for 3crr fr  ii hosts .",
    "the hosts of the x - shaped sources appear in the plot to have a distribution to greater ellipticities and the median ellipticity for the hosts of x - shaped sources is @xmath50 , which is somewhat greater than the median ellipticity ( @xmath51 ) of the hosts of 3crr frii radio sources .",
    "the indications here are in agreement with an earlier suggestion @xcite of relatively higher ellipticity for the hosts of x - shaped sources .",
    "however , it may be noted here that this finding is not statistically significant since the wilcoxon - mann - whitney test suggests a 26% probability that the observed distribution to higher ellipticities is a chance occurance . as pointed out by @xcite , x - shaped radio galaxy hosts need not be highly elliptical relative to the parent population of hosts of radio galaxies . in our sample",
    "there are 6 sources with apparently circular host galaxies . as galaxy ellipticity",
    "is known to vary with radius we need a more quantitative measure for this parameter , and high quality images of a sample of hosts , to examine for correlations with more confidence .",
    "we have also examined the radio - optical axis offsets in radio sources with mini - wings : inversion - symmetric central distortions that result in extensions of the lobes transverse to the main radio axis , which have lengths less than half the length of their respective main lobes .",
    "our sample of mini - wing sources consists of 11 members of the 3crr sample : 3c19 , 3c33 , 3c42 , 3c46 , 3c234 , 3c274.1 , 3c284 , 3c319 , 3c341 , 3c300 and 3c381 .",
    "because the p.a.s of the mini wings are ill defined , we examined only the radio - optical p.a .",
    "offsets of main lobes with respect to the optical axes .",
    "five of the host galaxies appear circular , in 2 sources ( 3c42 and 3c300 ) the radio axis is within @xmath52 of the host major axis , and in 4 ( 3c33 , 3c284 , 3c319 and 3c381 ) the radio axes make angles exceeding @xmath46 relative to their host major axes .",
    "we examined the four cases of large offsets individually . in two sources , 3c284 and 3c381 , the p.a .",
    "offset between the radio axes and extended emission - line gas is about @xmath53 and @xmath31 respectively @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the lobe deflections resulting in mini wings appear to occur near the boundary of the emission line gas distribution and the directions of apparent bending are consistent with a deflection of backflow at the boundary . in the case of 3c319",
    "the radio axis is close to the minor axis ( @xmath12pa = @xmath54 ) : in this case the mini - wing is observed in only one lobe and here we identify a galaxy to the south of the host which appears to have deflected the backflow @xcite . in the fourth case , 3c33 , extended emission line gas at p.a . of about 20@xmath16 with respect to",
    "the southern lobe appears to be influencing the backflow and deflecting it east , whereas the northern lobe deflects east somewhat away from the core @xcite .",
    "a member of this sample , 3c341 , is noted to have a circular galaxy   @xcite .",
    "to summarize , in these mini - winged sources the p.a .",
    "of the emission - line gas distribution appears to replace the role of the host galaxy in the shaping of the backflows .",
    "the problem for the backflow model posed by the discovery of a class of x - shaped radio sources with edge - darkened lobes and lobes that lack hotspots is alleviated by the discovery of double - double morphologies in a relatively large fraction of them , which suggests that these x - shaped radio sources appear so only because their central engines have recently ceased feeding their outer lobes .",
    "excluding the two with circular hosts , all the six sources we have identified as belonging to this class have their main radio axes closer to the host major axis and wings that are closer to the host minor axis  properties associated with fr - ii x - shaped sources . moreover ,",
    "the lobe - wing pairs are observed to be on the same side of the major axis , as required by the backflow model for the formation of x - structures .",
    "therefore , it appears that whether of fr - i type or fr - ii type the backflow model is able to explain the formation of wings in these sources .",
    "the inference that x - shaped sources that appear to have an fr - i structure were fr - ii type hot - spot radio sources in the past active phase , with strong backflows that interacted with the host galaxy , leads to the suggestion that the edge - brightened fr - ii lobes transformed to edge - darkened fr - i morphology with time following the cessation of jets , at least for these major - axis sources with strong backflows .    for the 3crr sample of nearby radio sources",
    "we have shown that there is no preferred orientation of the radio axis : radio galaxies emerge at all angles with respect to the host major axis .",
    "this lack of a preferred orientation for a general population of radio galaxies was also the conclusion of several previous investigations ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , examining the properties of large - scale radio structures in the nearby 3crr powerful radio galaxies , clear differences are seen depending on the direction of propagation of their jets relative to their host axes .",
    "sources that are oriented along a direction closer to the host major axis  the major - axis sources  do not grow large on average and tend to be associated with winged lobe structures .",
    "in contrast , minor - axis sources have larger projected linear sizes on the average and rarely develop off - axis distortions in their lobes .    separately , for a sample of giant radio galaxies , we have shown that there is a strong preference for the radio axis to be along the host minor axis : giant radio sources are predominantly minor - axis sources . while a small fraction do form along directions closer to the host",
    "major axes these are found to have prominent off - axis lobe structures .",
    "once again , similar to the 3crr sample , major - axis giant radio sources are found to be associated with winged structures .    for our sample of 31 x - shaped sources , which is larger than the sample examined by @xcite , we find a striking preference for the main radio axes to be in the quadrants of the host major axes , and for the wings to be in the quadrants containing the host minor axes ; this is consistent with and an improvement on the significance of the earlier work .",
    "several previous studies demonstrated a link between environment and radio structures : @xcite presented the correlated asymmetries between radio source extents and extended emission - line gas distribution , and @xcite and @xcite for correlated asymmetries between radio source extents and ambient large - scale environments of giant radio galaxies . that the ambient medium affects radio morphologies",
    "is also demonstrated by examples like 3c433 and ngc  326 , in which the lobes on the side of the close galaxy neighbour develop off - axis deviations correspondingly earlier , and examples like 3c341 and 3c28 , in which the extended emission - line region appears to shape and redirect plasma flows although influence of an overdensity of hot , x - ray emitting gas , particularly in 3c28 , may have a greater influence ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in all of these examples",
    "it is thermal gas concentrations that are encountered by radio jets or bulk synchrotron plasma flows , resulting in a hindrance to the forward flow or a deflection of backflows .",
    "our findings of a clear connection between the morphological properties of powerful radio galaxies and their orientation relative to their host  whether the radio source is a minor- or major - axis source  is suggestive of an influence of asymmetry in the host galaxy environment on the radio source morphology . the previous case studies and findings of circumstantial evidence for interactions between radio synchrotron plasma and thermal gas suggest that our work presented herein may be interpreted as arising due to differences in the ambient density and gradients thereof along the host galaxy major axis compared to that along the host galaxy minor axis",
    ". these differences may differentially affect the forward propagation of jets in the major and minor axis directions and the strength of backflows ; additionally , the off - axis deflection of backflows would themselves differ between minor- and major - axis sources owing to the different strengths in the backflows and pressure gradients .",
    "it may be noted here that although ` mini - wing ' type lobe distortions have been associated with thermal gas concentrations in the form of extended emission line regions , the more spectacular ` wings ' in x - shaped radio sources appear to be a consequence of lobe interactions with the more extensive thermal halos of galaxies .    since double radio sources",
    "are observed to have similar axial ratios independent of linear size @xcite , it follows that backflow  at least of the relativistic electrons  is essential if the bridge is to remain visible despite the inevitable expansion losses .",
    "studies have indicated that backflowing plasma from hotspots in powerful radio galaxies might attain quite high velocities : perhaps as much as several tenth s of the velocity of light @xcite .",
    "the conditions encountered by the backflowing plasma in the vicinity of the host galaxy in the two cases of major- and minor - axis jet propagation are different . assuming that the gaseous environment of the host galaxy has the ellipticity and p.a . of the stellar component",
    ", the gas density and pressure gradients would be greater along the minor as compared to the major axis .      in most winged radio sources and the x - shaped radio sources an association in the form of a connectedness in structure",
    "is often observed between the wing pair and the lobe pair : each of the wings are associated with particular lobes and in many it has been observed that the associated wing and lobe are on the same side of the host major axis .",
    "the connection between lobe and associated wing has sometimes also been observed in a continuity in b - field .",
    "these argue in favor of models in which wings are fed by backflows from lobes .",
    "it is remarkable that wings are observed exclusively in sources that have continuous or filled main lobes : there is no case in which the main lobes are docked and a pair or wings are observed as a symmetric structure extending across the core , disconnected from the main lobes , and forming a secondary pair of lobes orthogonal to the main lobes .",
    "sources with continuous bridges are expected to be those with strong backflows and , therefore , this finding underlines the importance of backflows , and the channeling of backflows into wing structures , for the existence of visible wings .",
    "mechanisms suggested for the backflow deflection have been either a buoyant lifting of the plasma away from the dense thermal galactic halo gas or a force provided by an overpressured cocoon of synchrotron plasma that then seeks the direction of the steepest pressure gradient along the minor axis .",
    "the wings are often observed to have rather collimated morphologies with magnetic field mostly along the linear extent .",
    "the integrity of the deflected backflow may not be maintained if it were to just expand freely ; therefore , while buoyancy may be playing a role , a driving force is required .",
    "an overpressured cocoon as suggested by @xcite is a possibility , although rather than originating only at the ends of the lobes it may be that the overpressure develops naturally as the backflow stalls upon reaching the denser regions of the galactic halo .",
    "collimation in the main lobes is thought of as arising due to greater advance speeds at the ends of the lobes compared to the lateral expansion speeds of the sides of the lobes .",
    "collimation in the wing structures may arise for a similar reason : within the backflow model and in an asymmetric environment the wings advance most rapidly along the direction of steepest pressure and density gradient . since the steepest gradient is along the minor axis of the host galaxy , then this might also be the preferred direction for the orientation of the wings , consistent with the finding in fig .  4 .",
    "as noted earlier in section  5 , the median ratio of wing to lobe lengths is 0.91 for x - shaped sources , implying that there are as many x - shaped sources with this ratio exceeding 0.91 as those with this ratio in the range 0.50.91 .",
    "the suggestion that large wing - to - main - lobe ratios are seen only in relatively smaller radio sources , and that this ratio decreases with increasing source size , is consistent with evolution of radio sources in an anisotropic environment , which manifests in a retardation in the growth of major - axis sources , enhancement in their backflows , and formation of wings of length dependent on the strength of the backflows and the retardation of the forward advance of the jets .    within the backflow scenario it is possible for extreme asymmetry in the environment to result in wings advancing faster than the main lobe , resulting in wings larger than the main lobe extent .",
    "this would require the main lobes to be directed along the direction of greater density , and the backflow creating wings along the direction of lower density .",
    "assuming that the heads at the ends of the main lobes as well as the advancing ends of the wings are ram pressure limited in their speeds by the external density , the ratio of the external densities encountered by the main lobes and wings would have to exceed the ratio of the pressures in the heads and wings .",
    "such an explanation for x - shaped radio sources in which the wings are larger than the main source extent weakens the argument that the existence of such structures requires axis flips for their origin .    concerning the wings in x - shaped radio sources",
    ", we may list three findings that argue in favor of a pre - existing channel along the minor axes or a preferred plane normal to the major axes as a conduit for the backflowing material : ( 1 ) the collimation observed in many wings of x - shaped radio sources , ( 2 ) the larger extents observed for many wings compared to the main lobes , and ( 3 ) the finding , as shown in fig .  4 , that wings tend to align close to the minor axes of the hosts even though the main radio axes have a wider spread in distribution about the major axes .",
    "our discussions above suggest that these findings may indeed have explanations within the backflow model , indicating that a purely environmental explanation is possible .",
    "first , it may be noted that dead radio galaxies are known to be notoriously rare @xcite .",
    "once the jets cease feeding the lobes , they are expected to suffer severe adiabatic expansion losses and disappear over a relatively short timescale compared to source lifetimes . in this context , it is difficult to understand the wings of x - shaped radio sources as relics of past activity when the renewed activity following a jet - reorientation has evolved to a linear size exceeding that of the wing , and particularly in the case of giant x - shaped radio sources .",
    "second , the morphologies of wings in x - shaped radio sources bear little resemblance to the known relic double radio sources like ic2476 @xcite and sgrs  j1911@xmath67048 @xcite , both of which have an overall edge - brightened and bounded appearance .",
    "it is perhaps more appropriate to compare the wings with relics that have been ` dead ' for timescales similar to that in which axis flips might occur : this has been estimated to be about @xmath55  yr @xcite .",
    "the outer relic lobes of double - double radio galaxies , which are believed to be restarting , have been estimated to have been ` dead ' for such timescales @xcite ; however , none of the wings in x - shaped radio sources resemble these relics . unlike the range of morphologies observed for the general population of radio galaxies ,",
    "all winged structures appear to be continuous and well filled with no emission gaps towards their central regions .",
    "it is unlikely that axis flips would occur only in a narrow range of source morphologies .",
    "the indications are that it is unlikely that x - shaped radio sources represent a pair of relic lobes and another independent pair of lobes created following an axis flip . in this context",
    ", it is of interest to consider the model proposed by @xcite , wherein the twin lobes are thought of as separate radio sources associated with a close pair of agns .",
    "a compelling argument against such a model is that the morphologies of the main lobes and wings of x - shaped sources have specific relationships and are not a random sampling of the morphologies observed in double radio sources .",
    "the main lobes are almost always edge - brightened and have bridges extending to the core . the wings do not have hotspots and they too are always extended all the way to the core . it is also difficult to account for the lobe - wing pairing seen in several x - shaped sources and the minor axis preference for the weaker and edge - darkened lobe pair in such a model .    in an alternate model suggested by @xcite , x - shaped sources might be a result of an axis flip following which backflow from the new lobes rejuvenates the relic lobe maintaining its visibility . in this picture a pre - existing channel along the minor axes as a conduit for the backflowing material might be naturally present as a relic cocoon , if the earlier activity prior to the black - hole merger and associated axis flip were aligned with the host minor axis .",
    "consistent with the finding that there is no preferred alignment between the radio axis and host optical axis in a general population of radio sources , we might expect all possible orientations of the black hole spin axis prior to a merger and associated flip . within the black - hole merger model ,",
    "flips from minor - axis to major - axis result in the new source experiencing enhanced backflow and , consequently a tendency to manifest as an x - shaped radio source if the backflow illuminates the relic lobes closer to the minor axis .",
    "the question then arises as to the outcome of axis flips from an initial major - axis state to a minor - axis orientation .    in this context , of relevance",
    "is the recent discovery of non - thermal x - ray emission in the high redshift radio galaxy , 3c294 , on either side of the core , and at a p.a .",
    "offset of about @xmath46 from the main radio axis ; the x - ray lobes are not visible in the radio @xcite .",
    "axis flips from a major- to minor - axis source would be expected to create new lobes along the minor axis , with poor backflow , less likelihood of forming an x - shaped radio source , but would result in a minor - axis double radio source with a relic pair of radio - invisible lobes closer to the major axis that might be visible in its inverse - compton scattering of cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "a final point is regarding our finding of a tendency for giant radio sources to preferentially be oriented closer to the host minor axis .",
    "in the unified model presented above seeking a common explanation for the formation of giants , x - shaped radio sources and off - axis lobe distortions , anisotropy in the galaxy environment is offered as the cause .",
    "we comment on another aspect here .",
    "if the minor axis in elliptical galaxies represents the axis of the large scale galaxy potential , it is the direction to which an offset black - hole axis may be re - oriented , as a result of an opposing torque to the torque that the black hole exerts on the immediate accretion disk surrounding it in the attempt to position it in its equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "this re - alignment timescale has been estimated to be @xmath56  yr , for eddington accretion rates , but could be larger for lower accretion rates .    the median linear size of radio sources are observed to be larger for orientations closer to the host minor axis ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which might be interpreted as alignment of the radio axis with the host minor axis with age . if this realignment is owing to the above @xcite model , we may expect that re - alignment timescales are comparable to lifetimes of giant radio galaxies , and that accretion rates are significantly below eddington .",
    "however , since the distribution of radio axes of sources is fairly uniform ( fig .  1 ) , implying that sources with relatively smaller sizes  presumably younger  are major - axis sources , the onset of radio activity is coeval with an event that offsets black hole axes away from the stable minor - axis direction .",
    "we have presented a new class of x - shaped radio sources , which lack hotspots and are sometimes edge - darkened .",
    "many of this class are observed to have double - double radio source morphologies .",
    "we have explored relations between radio source morphologies and the relative angle between the radio axis and host optical galaxy axes .",
    "the study is based entirely on axis orientations as projected on the sky .",
    "the well known 3crr sample of nearby radio galaxies has been used given the high quality radio and optical data available for this sample .",
    "radio - optical morphology relations have been also examined for representative samples of giant radio galaxies and , separately , x - shaped radio sources .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are :    \\(1 ) wing formation in both edge - brightened as well as edge - darkened x - shaped radio sources may be understood as arising from redirection of backflow into wings .",
    "most edge - darkened x - shaped radio sources are presently undergoing renewed nuclear activity that is observed in the form of inner double structures : we propose that the wings in edge - darkened x - shaped radio sources represent backflows from a past activity episode .",
    "\\(3 ) although double radio sources may have axes randomly distributed with respect to the host galaxy axes , the size to which a radio source grows and its radio morphology are influenced by the relative orientation .",
    "minor - axis sources tend to have larger linear sizes compared to major - axis sources .",
    "major - axis sources have a greater propensity for off - axis lobe distortions in the form of winged structures as compared to minor - axis sources .",
    "\\(6 ) x - shaped radio sources have radio axes within @xmath46 of their host major axes .",
    "the wings in x - shaped radio sources are within 40@xmath16 of their host minor axes .",
    "although the main radio axes in these sources are fairly uniformly distributed over the range , the wings have a strong preference to be within about 10@xmath16 of the host minor axes .",
    "we are led to the conclusion that the morphology of powerful double radio sources depends on whether the source is of major- or minor - axis type .",
    "the reason appears to be an anisotropy in the environment , which is related to the ellipticity of the host galaxy .",
    "the anisotropy appears to influence the forward advance of the beams , the strength of the backflow in the cocoon , and the formation of wings and off - axis distortions in the lobes .",
    "the interaction of backflows in a major - axis radio source with an anisotropic environment associated with the host  perhaps an elliptic halo  appears necessary for the formation of x - shaped radio sources ; this may indeed be a sufficient condition .",
    "there is observational evidence for binary nuclei and axis flips in agns .",
    "axis flips may not be a necessary or dominant mechanism for the formation of x - shaped radio sources .",
    "nevertheless , the study presented here suggests that even if axis flips are the cause for the formation of x - shaped radio sources , backflows appear to be important in directing material from the new lobe into the relic lobes .    the lack of any preferred radio - optical p.a .",
    "for the general population of radio sources suggests that the initial orientation of an active radio source prior to a black - hole merger might not have any preferred direction . assuming this is so",
    ", an interesting outcome is that if x - shaped radio sources are created by axis flips in the black - hole merger model , an equal number of minor - axis radio sources ought to exist , representing sources in which the axis has flipped from a major- to minor - axis orientation , in which the relic lobe along the major axis might be observable in inverse - compton x - rays and not in radio emission .",
    "however , if black holes are re - oriented to align with the host minor axis over time , black - hole mergers and associated axis flips might result in post - merger radio sources that avoid the minor axis .",
