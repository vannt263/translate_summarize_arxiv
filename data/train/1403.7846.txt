    "channel quantization in a network with multiple receivers is fundamentally different from that in a point - to - point system . in a point - to - point system",
    ", the receiver can acquire the entire channel state information ( csi ) and send the corresponding quantized feedback information to the transmitter @xcite . on the other hand , in a network with multiple receivers ,",
    "each receiver only has access to its own local csi due to different geographical locations of the different receivers .",
    "each receiver can thus quantize only a part of the entire global csi , which results in a distributed quantization problem .    in the existing work on distributed quantization for networks @xcite ,",
    "each receiver first quantizes its local csi independently and then sends a finite number of bits representing quantized information through feedback links to other terminals . after decoding feedback information from all receivers ,",
    "each terminal reconstructs the quantized version of the global csi .",
    "afterwards , transmission methods such as beamforming or power control are adopted by treating the global quantized csi as the exact unquantized csi .",
    "for example , power control and throughput maximization for interference networks based on separate quantized feedback information from receivers are analyzed in @xcite . in @xcite , beamformers are designed for the @xmath0-user mimo interference channels with independent quantized information from each receiver .",
    "the performance of these quantizers depend on the number of feedback bits assigned for quantization to each receiver and always suffer from some loss when compared with the optimal performance .    in this paper , we propose a novel distributed quantization strategy with multiple rounds of feedback communication in the form of conferencing between receivers . through conferencing among receivers ,",
    "partial csi from other receivers can be utilized for a better overall quantizer performance . to illustrate this",
    ", we consider the distributed quantization problem for two - user interference networks with time sharing and interference transmission strategies .",
    "the network outage probability is the performance metric .",
    "we first propose a distributed quantizer that achieves the optimal network outage probability of sum rate in both time sharing and interference transmission with only two bits of feedback information .",
    "we also propose a distributed quantizer that attains the optimal network outage probability of minimum rate in time sharing with finite average feedback rate .",
    "for the optimal network outage probability of minimum rate in interference transmission , a distributed quantizer that can approach it closely is also proposed . by numerical simulations ,",
    "we show the effectiveness of the proposed quantizers by comparing them with the conventional ones .",
