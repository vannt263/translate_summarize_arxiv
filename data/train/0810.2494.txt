    "numerical simulations predict that magnetic flux emerging into the solar atmosphere interact and reconnect with the pre - existing chromospheric and coronal field .",
    "this suggests that flux emergence is a relevant source of energy for the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the interaction and the consequent heating seem to depend on the geometry of the two flux systems @xcite .",
    "while at large scale these results have been confirmed by high - resolution observations @xcite , the role of small - scale emergence events in the heating of the upper atmospheric layers , as described by @xcite , is still lacking observational confirmation .    in the absence of other diagnostics ,",
    "heating events in the chromosphere can be detected through the intensity profiles of the h and k lines .",
    "the correlation between flux emergence and chromospheric emission was analyzed in detail by @xcite , who observed anomalous profiles in the k line in an emerging active region .",
    "however , very few examples of small - scale transient brightenings have been reported in the literature , and most of them are related to flux cancellation events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the _ hinode _ satellite , with its unprecedented spatial resolution , offers for the first time the possibility to investigate the processes that occur in the chromosphere during the emergence of magnetic flux at small spatial scales . in this letter",
    "we analyze simultaneous chromospheric and photospheric observations of an emerging flux region taken with the solar optical telescope aboard _",
    "hinode_. during the emergence event ,",
    "strong brightenings were detected in the h line core without relevant counterparts in g - band intensity , which suggests that chromospheric heating did occur at the site of flux emergence .",
    "on 2007 september 30 , as part of the _ hinode _ operation plan 14 ( _ hinode_/canary islands campaign ) , the active region noaa 10971 was observed by the solar optical telescope ( sot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ hinode _ @xcite .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) was centered at solar coordinates ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , i.e. , @xmath2 away from disk center .",
    "the sot spectro - polarimeter ( sp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) performed six raster scans of the active region from 08:00 to 14:00 ut , acquiring the stokes i , q , u , and v profiles of the photospheric lines at 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm .",
    "the fov covered by the sp observations is @xmath3 , with an effective pixel size of @xmath4 ( fast map mode ) .",
    "simultaneously , the sot broadband filter imager ( bfi ) acquired filtergrams in the core of the h line ( @xmath5 ) and in the g band ( @xmath6 ) , while the narrowband filter imager ( nfi ) obtained shuttered stokes i and v filtergrams in the wings of the d1 line at @xmath7 .",
    "the bfi images have a spatial sampling of @xmath8/pixel ( g - band ) and @xmath9/pixel ( h ) , while that of the nfi filtergrams is @xmath10/pixel .",
    "the bfi and nfi time series have a cadence of one minute and extend from 07:00 to 17:00 ut , with a small gap between 10:05 and 10:20 ut .",
    "we have corrected the sot / sp and sot / fg images for dark current , flat field , and cosmic rays with standard solarsoft routines . besides obtaining photospheric and chromospheric information through corrected g - band and h filtergrams ,",
    "we have constructed magnetograms from the d1 stokes i and v images acquired @xmath11 m off the line center . from the ratio @xmath12",
    "we calculate the magnetic flux density @xmath13 using the weak fied approximation @xcite as @xmath14\\ ] ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to first order , the magnetograms computed in this way are not affected by doppler shifts .",
    "we remind the reader that , at disk center , the d1 line refers to the upper photospheric layers and not to the chromosphere .    for each raster scan of the sp , the profile with the minimum total polarization degree , @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] ,",
    "was selected as a reference profile .",
    "all the spectra in the scan were normalized to the continuum of this profile and corrected for limb darkening .",
    "also , a stray light profile was computed by averaging the reference profiles of the six scans .    adopting a grid paradigm ,",
    "we have inverted the spectra with @xmath16 using the sir code @xcite .",
    "the inversion yields the temperature stratification in the range @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the optical depth of the continuum at @xmath19 ) , together with the magnetic field strength , inclination and azimuth angles in the line - of - sight ( _ los _ ) reference frame , the _ los _ velocity , and the magnetic filling factor , assuming these quantities to be constant with height . azimuth and",
    "inclination angles have been transformed to the local solar frame , whereas the _ los _ velocity has been calibrated using the mean quiet - sun intensity profile computed from pixels with @xmath20 , following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "finally , all the sot / fg and sot / sp images have been aligned through cross - correlation algorithms .",
    "noaa 10971 has a classical bipolar @xmath21 configuration , as can be seen in the d1 magnetogram of fig .",
    "the various sot instruments recorded the emergence of a small bipolar region , which appeared at the internal edge of the main negative polarity .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays a temporal sequence of d1 magnetograms with a cadence of about 20 minutes for the @xmath22 mm@xmath23 area marked in fig .",
    "the first magnetogram of the sequence , acquired at 07:50 ut , shows the presence of a positive - polarity knot . in the following magnetograms we clearly recognize an increase in its area , as well as the appearance of a negative - polarity patch",
    "the subsequent evolution is characterized by the separation of the opposite magnetic polarities , as indicated by the arrows .",
    "the corresponding temporal sequence of h filtergrams is also displayed in fig .  [ fig2 ] and shows transient brightness enhancements at the location of the positive footpoint .",
    "this emergence event led to the appearance of bright points in the g band ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , left panel ) and to intensity enhancements in the h line core ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , right panel ) .",
    "maps of the physical parameters derived from the sp raster scans are displayed in fig .",
    "they demonstrate the rapid evolution of the small bipolar region : the changes in , e.g. , the magnetic field distribution ( second and third rows ) indicate a very dynamic phase .",
    "the small bipolar region shows an emergence zone , i.e. , a region between the two main polarities with horizontal fields @xcite in which upflows of @xmath24 can be seen at 9:18 ut and 12:23 ut .",
    "the footpoints of the emerging region exhibit vertical fields and downflows of @xmath25 .",
    "the initial photospheric total flux content of the emerging region is @xmath26 , classifying as a small ephemeral region .",
    "the bipole axis was inclined about @xmath27 to the north - south direction in the first raster scan , but this angle varied with time .",
    "the negative - polarity footpoint soon merged with the dominant negative flux of the active region , disappearing as an individual feature .    in this area",
    "we have detected chromospheric h brightness enhancements with two main peaks during the observations , each one preceded by a minor peak . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the brightenings are associated with the positive - polarity footpoint . the duration of each peak is about half an hour , with an enhancement of @xmath28 with respect to the `` quiet '' level .",
    "the presence of these peaks points to interactions between the new emerging and the old pre - existing flux systems .",
    "we have computed the average intensity of the four most luminous pixels within the @xmath29 fov for the h and g - band filtergrams , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the trend of brightness in h and g band in normalized units .",
    "the different behaviour indicates that they are not correlated , as the chromospheric brightness enhancements are much more intense than the increase observed in the g band at the same times .",
    "thus , the observed h enhancements are genuinely due to photons coming from the chromosphere , and not to the significant photospheric contribution included in the passband of the sot h filter @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the positive flux in the @xmath22 mm@xmath23 area using the d1 magnetograms , which have a noise level of approximately @xmath30 .",
    "the main contribution to the positive flux comes from the positive polarities of the emerging region . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the flux evolution with time : the chromospheric brightness enhancements clearly correspond to an increase of positive magnetic flux in the upper photosphere .",
    "interestingly , in both cases the maximum ca ii h intensities are reached some 30 minutes after the positive flux starts to increase .    taking into account the temporal coincidence between the chromospheric brightenings and the positive flux increase , as well as the spatial coincidence between the location and morphology of the h brightenings and the emerging bipolar region ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; compare also the second , third , and fifth rows of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , we conclude that the localized chromospheric heating is a consequence of the emergence and subsequent interaction of the positive flux of the new bipole , which cancels with the negative ambient magnetic field .",
    "using _ hinode _ filtergrams and spectropolarimetric measurements , we have studied a small - scale flux emergence event .",
    "two peaks of chromospheric origin have been detected in the h line - core intensity almost simultaneously to a magnetic flux increase in the upper photosphere .",
    "we suggest that the chromospheric brightness enhancements may be indication that two different flux systems undergo magnetic reconnection : the old flux system belonging to the active region and the emerging magnetic field .",
    "the energy released in the process heats the chromosphere .",
    "the observed h brightenings are associated with a relatively modest amount of emerged magnetic flux ( only @xmath31 compared with the total negative flux in the region of @xmath32 ) , which points to a highly efficient heating mechanism .",
    "we conjecture that , while the positive flux increases , part of it cancels with the pre - existing negative flux , very likely in a process of magnetic reconnection .",
    "our result suggests that joule dissipation may be a significant source of chromospheric heating during the reconnection of an emerging flux system with a pre - existing magnetic field .",
    "this would confirm the predictions of recent numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also at small scales .",
    "moreover , our work suggests that h brightness enhancements can be used as a valuable diagnostics of flux emergence .",
    "further investigations should put this result into a firm observational and theoretical basis .    financial support by the european commission through the solaire network ( mtrn - ct-2006 - 035484 ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
