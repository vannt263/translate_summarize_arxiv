    "our present understanding of complex astrophysical objects such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) comes nearly entirely from the temporal and spectral analyses of their photoemissions ( with some additional information coming from possible associations , such as host galaxies ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the temporal aspects of grb light curves observed by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) aboard the fermi satellite .",
    "many studies of the temporal properties of grb light curves have been published , such as  @xcite , from the perspective that light curves are comprised of a series of displaced pulses and that by fitting the individual pulses and associating pulses at various photon energies one can arrive at a holistic understanding of light curves which in turn may be used to constrain the physics of the engines that produce them .",
    "the main appeal of this approach is the intuitive connection between pulses and collisions in the internal shock model .",
    "while this is a perfectly reasonable method , issues do arise concerning the functional form to use for pulse fitting and how to discern actual pulses from stochastic fluctuations in the light curves .",
    "the situation is further exacerbated by the fact that grb light curves exhibit considerable variation in duration and in pulse profile .",
    "we note the significant progress made in non - parametric analyses using the bayesian block technique  @xcite . in this type of analyis the duration of a light curve",
    "is represented as a tessellated block of time which can be partitioned into a complete array of sub - blocks in any number of ways .",
    "an optimal partition ( a partition of sub - blocks maximizing a fitness function ) is shown to exist , be unique , and computable iteratively .",
    "the optimal partition of sub - blocks is determined , given a prior probablility distribution for the number of blocks , by finding the model best representing the data as sets of piece - wise constant segments or sub - blocks .",
    "this technique shows great promise in resolving statistically significant temporal features from noise and detector related artifacts .",
    "an ideal complementary approach to probing light curves would be one which handles seemingly disparate profiles on an equal footing and distills their complex forms into a single parameter which may be used to compare one light curve with another .",
    "one such method was pioneered by harold edwin hurst  @xcite with a technique he invented called the rescaled range analysis ( r / s ) which was later improved upon by benoit mandelbrot  @xcite .",
    "the eponymous parameter resulting from the rescaled range analysis is called the hurst exponent , @xmath0 , and is closely related to the fractal dimension , d , the understanding of which mandelbrot spent much of his career developing .",
    "in fact , fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , which mandelbrot defined in 1968 , is parametrized solely by @xmath0 and serves as a useful model for discussing time series .",
    "after determining @xmath0 for a given time series one is in a position to make several statements about the nature of that time series including whether the sequence appears random or whether it is persistent or anti - persistent , and if so , whether it exhibits long - range dependence , and over what time scales these characteristics are operative .",
    "all of these are informative quantitative statements , especially if the specific process generating the time series is partially or completely unknown , in which case , these statements are perhaps all one can really say about the process given the available information .",
    "some fields of research in which interesting work is being done with hurst exponents are financial markets , seismology , anesthesiology , astrophysics , plasma physics and genomics .",
    "we point out that neither the pulse fitting methods nor the bayesian block analysis  @xcite yields information directly relatable to the hurst exponent as does the wavelet analysis .",
    "one approach to access the hurst exponent from a bayesian block framework that seems reasonable would be an adaptation of the box - counting algorithm  @xcite .",
    "such a bayesian - box - counting algorithm is outside the scope of this paper .    the estimation of the hurst exponent and the related scaling exponent , @xmath1 , has a history in astrophysics  @xcite for both cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and grbs .",
    "we propose that a similar determination of @xmath0 for grb light curves will be a valuable tool for categorization and we present a separation of long and short grbs based on @xmath0 .",
    "pioneering work in self - similarity and long - range dependence was first published in 1951 by hurst in the study of annual nile river levels ,  @xcite .",
    "hurst examined several decades of data to determine what should be the minimum size of a reservoir so that it neither overflows nor runs dry due to yearly fluctuations and made the unexpected observation that annual nile river levels were not independent from one another but instead exhibited a _",

    "width=317 ]    in this analysis of time - series data we search for statistical fractals , i.e. , fractals whose statistical characteristics are independent of time scale .",
    "such fractal time - series are called _ self - similar_. there is another class of statistical fractals whose scale invariance is broken but can be restored by a multiplicative factor .",
    "these statistical fractals are called _ self - affine_. @xcite defined a time - series , @xmath5 with @xmath6 , to be self - affine if , after a rescaling @xmath7 the following relation is satisfied , @xmath8 the exponent , @xmath0 , is the hurst exponent ,  @xcite and the symbol @xmath9 denotes equality in distribution .",
    "the canonical example of a self - affine time - series , also given by @xcite , is fractional brownian motion , fbm .",
    "stationary in the context of this paper is second - order stationarity which means the first and second moments obey the following relations @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the sample - mean , @xmath12 is the auto - covariance sequence and @xmath13 is the lag",
    ". the hurst exponent , @xmath0 , parametrizes the degree of statistical self - similarity which a time - series exhibits . a self - similar series may be sub - divided into three categories : a series with @xmath14 is referred to as persistent or long - range dependent while a series with @xmath15 is referred to as anti - persistent ,  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath16 we have neither persistence nor anti - persistence and this corresponds to the case of random and uncorrelated events .",
    "the hurst exponent provides a model - independent characterization of the data .",

    "wavelet transformations have been shown to be a natural tool for multiresolution analysis of non - stationary time - series @xcite .",
    "wavelet analysis is similar to fourier analysis in many respects but differs in that a wavelet basis function , @xmath17 , is well - localized while fourier basis functions are global .",
    "localization means that outside some range the amplitudes of wavelet basis functions go to zero or are otherwise negligibly small ,  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the wavelet transform is similar to the fourier transform because they both are expansions into a complete orthogonal basis and resolve low - frequency , large scale structure from high - frequency , small scale structure .",
    "wavelet analysis is said to be multiresolution because the time - series under investigation is interrogated at multiple scales by a basis set of wavelets which are rescaled and translated versions of an original wavelet commonly referred to as the mother - wavelet , @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents an octave or time - scale and the parameter @xmath20 gives the position of the wavelet within the octave .    the continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) coefficient , @xmath21 , of a time - series for some scale and position",

    "[ eq : wavelet - self - affine ] that a self - affine time - series will have wavelet coefficients whose variance over a particular scale , @xmath24 , is related to the scale parameter @xmath25 by , @xmath26    [ [ fast - wavelet - transforms ] ] fast wavelet transforms + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    similar to the cwt , the discrete fast wavelet transform ( fwt ) is also a multiresolution operation owing to the construction of the wavelets , @xmath27 , which form the basis of the discrete fast wavelet transform .",
    "we employed the discrete wavelet transform because of its high degree of computational efficiency . in order to distinguish between the cwt and its fwt counterpart we make a slight change of notation .",
    "just as before , the @xmath27 , are rescaled , translated versions of the mother wavelet , @xmath28 , @xmath29 the coefficients of the fwt are written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 play the roles of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . moreover ,",
    "the values which @xmath31 and @xmath32 assume obey the dyadic partitioning scheme  @xcite .",
    "that is , for a time series whose number of elements is given by @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 applying the dyadic partitioning scheme removes any redundant encoding of information by the wavelet transform coefficients and guarantees orthogonality among the wavelet basis for any change in @xmath31 or @xmath32 , @xmath36      the average power of the light curve at time scale @xmath31 is expressed as @xmath37 and may be written in terms of the variance of the fwt coefficients as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of coefficients at scale , @xmath31 ,  @xcite . similarly to eq .",
    "[ eq : cwt - variance ] , it has been shown by  @xcite that for a series with non - stationary statistics the power - law variance of wavelet coefficients goes like @xmath40 where @xmath0 is the hurst exponent .",

    "a plot of eq .",
    "[ eqn : hurst_est ] is referred to as a logscale diagram .",
    "logscale diagrams are useful for identifying scaling regions , i.e. , the range of octaves over which self - affine scaling occurs .",
    "the slope , @xmath1 , of the scaling region is related to the hurst exponent through @xmath41 .    in practice , a piecewise fitting function , @xmath42 is defined , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the value of @xmath31 at which the piecewise fitting function changes definition .      as in any orthogonal transformation ,",
    "the basis functions to use in a wavelet transform is a matter of strategic choice .",
    "one typically chooses a basis that emphasizes some characteristic of interest .",
    "commonly used families of wavelet bases are the coiflet , daubechies , and haar  @xcite .",
    "we chose the haar wavelet basis which is the simplest of the daubechies family .",
    "the haar wavelet basis was chosen from among all other possible bases because it has the fewest number of vanishing moments and most compact support  @xcite , has a straightforward interpretation , i.e. , is equivalent to the allan variance  @xcite and is constant over its interval of support similar to the model assumed in the bayesian block method  @xcite .",
    "the haar basis is not without some defects , as noted by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "namely , the haar wavelet transformation is known to underestimate the actual hurst exponent and this phenomenon is a function of the coarseness of the binning , the number of counts in the light curve , and also of h itself .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ testcase ] that this effect is present but smaller than @xmath451@xmath46 for a set of simulated light curves and is likely to be smaller for actual data .",
    "however , we consider that the advantages of the haar basis outweigh its disadvantages .        spurious artifacts due to incidental symmetries resulting from accidental misalignment @xcite of light curves with wavelet basis functions are minimized by circularly shifting the light curve against the basis functions .",
    "circular shifting is a form of translation invariant de - noising  @xcite .",
    "it is possible a shift will introduce additional artifacts by moving a different symmetry into a susceptible location .",
    "the best approach is to circulate the signal through all possible values , or at least a representative sampling , and then take an average over the cases which minimizes the effect of spurious correlations .",
    "both discrete fourier and discrete wavelet transformations imply that the expansion is periodic , with the longest period equal to the full time range of the input data .",
    "this can be interpreted to mean that for a series of @xmath47 elements , @xmath48 then @xmath49 is made a surrogate for @xmath50 and @xmath51 is made a surrogate for @xmath52 , and so forth .",
    "this assumption may lead to trouble if @xmath49 is much different from @xmath53 . in this case ,",
    "artificially large variances may be computed .",
    "reverse - tail concatenation minimizes this problem by making a copy of the series which is then reversed and concatenated onto the end of the original series resulting in a new series with a length twice that of the original .",
    "instead of matching boundary conditions like , @xmath54 we match boundaries as , @xmath55 note that the series length has thus artificially been increased to @xmath56 by reversing and doubling of the original series .",
    "consequently , the wavelet variances at the largest scale in a logscale diagram reflect this redundancy .",
    "this is the reason that the wavelet variances at the largest scale are excluded from least - squares fits of the scaling region .",
    "photon counting statistics are considered in a bootstrapping procedure by applying a poisson operator , @xmath57(@xmath58 ) , to every light curve prior to analyzing .",
    "each light curve is binned initially at 200 @xmath59-seconds and the number of counts per bin , @xmath60 , is used as a mean value , @xmath61 , to be supplied to a poisson random number generator .",
    "the value returned from @xmath57(@xmath58 ) is used to replace the number of counts stored in @xmath60 .",
    "the poisson operator is applied to the signal @xmath60 prior to every circular permutation .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ testcase ] that the poisson operator does not affect the measured slope of logscale diagrams above the poisson level .",
    "spatial - temporal fractional brownian motions ( fbm s ) are a useful model for studying self - similarity and long - range dependence in non - stationary time - series ,  @xcite and are characterized by a single parameter , @xmath0 , the hurst exponent .",
    "an fbm with a particular @xmath0 is expressed as @xmath62 and has the property of self - similarity over a range of scales after a rescaling of axes , @xmath63 where @xmath9 denotes distributional equality as in section  [ sec : selfaffn ] .     with @xmath2 .",
