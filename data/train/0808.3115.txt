    "development of experimental capabilities dealing with nanostructures brings necessity of appropriate theoretical description of quantum transport ( charge , spin , and heat ) in mesoscopic junctions to the forefront of research.@xcite indeed , a lot of work has been done in this direction . in particular ,",
    "many approaches are based on the landauer expression for current through such junctions in elastic tunneling regime.@xcite one of specific features of molecular transport junctions , the focus of molecular electronics , is flexibility of the molecules , which results in inelastic features being much more pronounced in transport through such junctions as compared e.g. to semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "inelastic features are used as a diagnostic tool , helping to assure presence of the molecule and study its characteristics in the junction within inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy both in the off - resonance ( iets)@xcite and resonant tunneling ( riets)@xcite situations .",
    "detailed discussion of the inelastic transport in molecular junctions can be found in refs .",
    ".    theoretical description of iets is well established today both within simple models@xcite and more realistic calculations.@xcite ability to predict quantitatively experimental findings is a sign of maturity of the field . from theoretical perspective",
    "this success is caused by ability to use well - established nonequilibrium perturbation ( in electron - vibration coupling ) technique .",
    "indeed , in the off - resonant situation electron - vibration coupling @xmath0 is an effectively small parameter , @xmath1 with @xmath2 being resonant off - set and @xmath3 characterizing strength of molecule - contacts coupling .",
    "this allows expansion of the evolution operator in powers of @xmath0 , and truncation at low ( @xmath4 ) order , the born approximation , is usually sufficient to get quantitatively correct predictions of iets signal in molecular junctions .",
    "resonant tunneling situation , @xmath5 , provides richer physics .",
    "while weak electron - vibration coupling , @xmath6 , is treated within perturbation theory also here,@xcite the last fails in the opposite situation , @xmath7 , when e.g. formation of polaron on the molecule becomes possible .",
    "theoretically this case till now mostly was treated either within scattering theory ( or isolated molecule ) approach,@xcite or within quasiclassical ( rate or generalized rate equations ) scheme.@xcite while the first treats electron - vibrational interaction ( numerically ) exactly , it disregards fermi populations in the contacts , as well as dynamical features due to their presence,@xcite and may lead to erroneous predictions.@xcite the last disregards quantum correlations , and as such is applicable to either high temperature , @xmath8 , ( truly classical ) situations , or ( for generalized rate equations approach ) quantum situations when correlations in the system die much quicker than electron transfer ( between contact and molecule ) time ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "besides , these schemes lack formal procedure for improvement of their results similar to taking into account higher order terms in perturbative expansion .",
    "recently we proposed nonequilibrium equation - of - motion ( eom ) approach perturbative in molecule - contact coupling capable of dealing with riets situation.@xcite the approach is formulated for simple resonant level model , but can be easily generalized for more realistic situations.@xcite while it incorporates contacts ( and hence nonequilibrium character of the junction ) into consideration , the price to pay is ( generally ) more approximate level of description of electron - vibration interaction on the bridge .",
    "alternatively , schemes exploring particular parameter regions ( slow vibration @xmath10,@xcite small , @xmath11,@xcite or big , @xmath12,@xcite bias ) were proposed at a model level .",
    "another point especially important for resonant transport ( both elastic and inelastic ) , when actual oxidation or reduction of the molecule takes place , is necessity to speak in the language of many - body molecular states contrary to single - particle molecular orbitals ( the last is used in most ab initio transport calculations today ) .",
    "this includes electronic structure reorganization upon charging , state dependent vibrational modes , anharmonicities , and non - born - oppenheimer couplings .",
    "first schemes trying to treat transport in a many - body molecule states language were recently proposed.@xcite    difficulties in describing riets stem from absence of well - established _",
    "nonequilibrium atomic limit _ for molecule in the junction .",
    "indeed , contacts play role of boundary conditions responsible for establishing nonequilibrium state of the molecule .",
    "the last is a complicated mixture of different charge ( and excitation ) states .",
    "approaches developed in molecular electronics community so far either disregard boundary conditions and treat molecule as an equilibrium object ( scattering theory and isolated molecule treatments ) , or establish this nonequilibrium state ( mostly nonequilibrium green function , negf , approaches ) being unable to map it into separate charge ( or more exactly state ) constituents .",
    "note , density matrix based schemes capable of such mapping were developed recently.@xcite such schemes however , miss time correlations , which may become important in e.g. noise spectrum calculations .",
    "hubbard operators is a natural language to talk about system ( in our case subsystem - molecule ) in terms of its states .",
    "thus one seems to be interested in utilizing nonequilibrium hubbard operator green function technique for description of situations similar to riets , when ability to establish nonequilibrium atomic limit of system is desirable",
    ". the approach should be capable to provide a systematic way to take correlations into account ( similar to perturbative expansion in standard diagrammatic techniques ) .",
    "such approach originating from kadanoff and baym functional derivative eom scheme , was developed in the form of equilibrium hubbard operator gfs by sandalov and coworkers for materials with strong electron correlations ( magnets with localized and partly localized moments , mott insulators , kondo lattices , heavy fermion systems , and high - tc superconductors).@xcite the method so far has been applied to model elastic transport through quantum dots@xcite and lowest states of double quantum dots,@xcite and is completely ignored in the molecular electronics community .    the goal of our present consideration is to introduce inelastic transport description in the coulomb blockade regime within proper non - equilibrium atomic limit , and to attract attention of the molecular electronics community to the proper nonequilibrium approach capable of speaking in the language of many - particle states ( rather than single - particle orbitals ) and taking into account both molecular charge state dependent normal modes ( presently largely ignored in simulations ) and non - adiabatic couplings .",
    "note , that kondo physics is beyond the scope of current consideration .",
    "the approach takes into account only on - the - molecule correlations in a way that generalizes previous considerations.@xcite note , that including many - body molecular states into consideration of transport potentially allows for : 1 .  much more accurate molecular structure simulation out of equilibrium than in current ab initio schemes , due to possibility to employ equilibrium quantum chemistry methods as a starting point for self - consistent procedure .",
    "2 .  proper treatment of oxidation / reduction and corresponding electronic and vibrational molecular structure changes , as well as non - adiabatic couplings , 3 .  ability to deal with general form of electron - vibration interaction as long as it is localized in space ( in the spirit of ref .",
    "but in addition retaining many - body character of the junction ) , 4 .",
    "calculation of noise spectrum of the junction due to preserved time correlations ( see e.g. ref .   for detailed discussion ) , 5 .",
    "proper treatment of degenerate situations due to preserved space correlations ( see e.g. ref .   for discussion ) .",
    "structure of the paper is the following . in section  [ method ]",
    "we briefly describe the method in terms of many - electronic states of the system , and compare it to previously proposed generalized master equation scheme .",
    "section  [ results ] presents numerical examples of its application to transport with discussion .",
    "section  [ conclude ] concludes .",
    "here we introduce model of molecular junction , briefly review the basics of nonequilibrium hubbard green function technique , and compare it to previously proposed generalized master equation approach .      as usual we consider molecular junction consisting of 3 parts : left ( l ) and right ( r ) contacts and the molecule ( m ) .",
    "the contacts are assumed to be reservoirs of free electrons each at its own equilibrium .",

    "their indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote electronic state in some chosen single - particle basis , and incorporate all the necessary quantum indices ( e.g. site and spin ) .",

    "in this case change in the subsystem energy , which will be observed in transport as inelastic peak in conductance , is @xmath146 ( we omit here change in elastic electronic energy for simplicity , this will define only position of the elastic peak in conductance ) . since @xmath147 and @xmath148 in principle can be any non - negative numbers , it is clear that one can observe a a progression of frequencies .",
    "note , that in this progression one can see inelastic peaks in conductance , separated from the elastic one by frequency which does not exist in the system at all ( e.g. @xmath149 ) .",

    "description of transport is more problematic , since one needs to know spectral function at finite temperature , where all excitations may contribute.@xcite nevertheless first approaches dealing with transport started to appear as well.@xcite the main complication with implementation of these methods ( besides dmrg ) for ab initio calculation is their complexity , so that all the calculations done so far are restricted to simple models only . in the case of molecular junctions",

    "we formulate the method within basis of charged states of the molecule .",
