    "recent data from cleo @xcite and e791@xcite experiments triggered a new wave of theoretical studies of the leading twist pion distribution amplitude ( @xmath6da ) .",
    "on one side the data have been reanalyzed taking into account nlo perturbative qcd effects , as well as nonperturbative effects parameterized within the qcd light - cone sum rules @xcite,@xcite . on the other hand nonperturbative models @xcite@xcite and lattice qcd @xcite@xcite have been employed to calculate the @xmath7da from the relatively nonrestrictive physical assumptions . here",
    "the dual nature of the pion , being the quark  antiquark bound state and the goldstone boson of the broken chiral symmetry at the same time , makes such calculations interesting by itself , even if the data is not yet decisive enough to distinguish between different models .",
    "pion distribution amplitude is usually defined by means of the following matrix element ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) : @xmath8 in the light cone kinematics where two quarks separated by the light cone distance @xmath9 along the direction @xmath10 are moving along the light cone direction @xmath11 parallel to the total momentum @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 mev . in this kinematical frame",
    "any four vector @xmath14 can be decomposed as : @xmath15 with@xmath16 , and the scalar product of two four vectors reads : @xmath17 in eq.([fipidef ] ) the path ordered exponential of the gluon field , required by the gauge invariance , has been omitted since we shall be working in the effective quark model where the gluon fields have been integrated out .    in the local limit matrix element ( [ fipidef ] ) reduces to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the properly normalized axial vector current .    in refs.@xcite",
    "@xmath20 has been calculated in the effective chiral quark model in which quarks interact _ nonlocally _ with an external meson field @xmath21 and acquire a momentum dependent constituent mass @xmath22 @xmath23 is a constituent quark mass of the order of @xmath24 mev and @xmath25 is a momentum dependent function such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "function @xmath25 embodies nonperturbative effects due to the nontrivial structure of the qcd  vacuum .",
    "indeed , @xmath25 has been explicitly derived within the instanton model @xcite . in refs.@xcite where the calculations were performed in the minkowski space ( instanton model is inevitably formulated in the euclidean metric ) a convenient ansatz for @xmath25 was used : @xmath28 with this ansatz @xmath20 as well as higher twist @xmath5da s were calculated in refs.@xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the problem is , however , that in the model with the nonlocal interaction ( and momentum dependent quark mass @xmath29 ) the axial current ( [ amu ] ) does not exhibit pcac @xcite@xcite .",
    "more drastically , a naive vector current @xmath30 is not conserved . in order to restore these properties extra currents have to be added to @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these new pieces modify both model expressions for @xmath0 and for @xmath33 .",
    "while the formula for @xmath0 is well known in terms of the euclidean integral @xcite,@xcite : @xmath34 ( here @xmath35 the form of the wave function has been a subject of different studies with , however , contradictory results .",
    "for example the distribution amplitude obtained in ref.@xcite is very close to the asymptotic form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the momentum fraction carried by the quark , whereas in refs.@xcite@xcite @xmath38 .    in the present work",
    "we derive the minkowski space formula for @xmath2 for the modified axial current replacing the naive current in eq.([amuel ] ) .",
    "our formula , when continued to the euclidean space , reduces to eq.([euclid ] ) .",
    "however , when evaluated in the minkowski space by methods developed in refs.@xcite , it can be represented as an integral over @xmath39 from an integrand which we interpret as @xmath20",
    ". this function does not resemble ( [ as ] ) and is compatible rather with the constant wave function of refs.@xcite@xcite than with the result obtained in the same model @xcite , however , with the naive current ( [ amu ] ) .",
    "there are several comments which are due at this point .",
    "first of all it is not clear how the modified current can be generalized to the bilocal operator entering formula ( [ fipidef ] ) .",
    "that is why it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite that rather than considering matrix elements of the form ( [ fipidef ] ) or ( [ amuel ] ) , one should calculate the whole physical process in the effective model , impose bjorken limit to make contact with the expressions known from qcd and extract the distribution amplitude .",
    "one has to note however , that the effective models are not valid at large momenta which are needed to impose bjorken limit .",
    "moreover it is not clear whether the distribution amplitudes defined that way are universal .",
    "secondly , arguments may be given that it is not necessary to insist that the bilocals defining the distribution amplitudes must reduce to the proper currents in the local limit .",
    "there are still corrections due to the momentum dependent constituent mass and nonlocal interactions . ] . indeed , as we shall show below the naive bilocal ( [ fipidef ] )",

    "one should note that while model distributions are defined as some low normalization scale @xmath132 , @xmath133 corresponds to the limit @xmath134 .",

    "as soon as we switch on the qcd evolution , distribution amplitude @xmath139 changes the shape and it goes to zero at the end points .",
    "this evolution is plotted in fig.[comp].b for @xmath140 , assuming 2 light flavors , @xmath141 mev , and initial scale @xmath142 mev .",
    "this initial scale has been adjusted in such a way , that the second gegenbauer coefficient @xmath143 , when evolved to the cleo point @xmath144 gev , gives @xmath145 as indicated by the analysis of ref.@xcite . for the normalization scale as large as @xmath146gev",
    "the evolved distribution is slowly approaching the asymptotic one .",
    "in the present paper we have derived a compact formula ( [ fullfpi ] ) for the pion decay constant in the nonlocal chiral quark model . in order to define @xmath0",
    "we have used the full nonlocal axial current ( [ atilde ] ) and the pcac relation ( [ pcac ] ) . equation ( [ fullfpi ] ) , when expanded in the pion momentum @xmath147 , reduces to the well known @xcite,@xcite formula ( [ fullfpi1 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of eq.([fullfpi ] ) consists in the fact that it can be evaluated in the minkowski space with a suitable ansatz for the momentum dependence of the constituent mass ( [ fkdef ] ) . by integrating ( [ fullfpi ] ) over @xmath85 and @xmath148",
    "we are left with a @xmath39 integral over the function @xmath149 which we _ interpret _ as a pion distribution amplitude ( [ phitld ] ) .    as mentioned at the end of sect.[intro ]",
    "it is not clear how to extend the local current ( [ atilde ] ) to the bilocal operator like the one entering formula ( [ fipidef ] )",
    ". therefore our definition of the pion distribution amplitude may be not correct .",
    "however , it is worth to note that the shape of our distribution amplitude resembles a constant da obtained by a consistent use of the ward - takahashi identities @xcite@xcite , rather than the da calculated in the instanton model of the qcd vacuum in ref.@xcite , although in both approaches full nonlocal currents have been used .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath5da derived here and in refs.@xcite@xcite is probably phenomenologically unacceptable .",
    "that is because the detailed analysis of the cleo data indicates that the coefficient @xmath150 gev@xmath151 is _ negative _ @xcite,@xcite and possibly as large as @xmath152 gev@xmath151 @xcite . in our case",
    ", however , @xmath153 is always _",
    "positive_. the same concerns the constant @xmath5da . in this respect @xmath154da derived in by the same methods in refs.@xcite using the bilocal operator",
    "( [ fipidef ] ) with no extra pieces corresponding to the nonlocal currents ( [ lr ] ) fits the data much better .",
    "that is because , similarly to the results of refs.@xcite , it exhibits a shallow minimum around @xmath155 which generates negative @xmath156    as already mentioned above , there is a problem how to define the distribution amplitudes in the effective models of qcd .",
    "this is due to the fact that the qcd currents and the model currents are not the same .",
    "one way would be to perform factorization and large @xmath137 expansion in qcd and then parameterize the nonperturbative matrix elements by a set of unknown distribution amplitudes . to calculate these matrix elements an effective model , like the one discussed here , is used . considering operators",
    "as obtained from qcd leads to the violation of pcac and , in the worse case , to the violation of the gauge invariance at the level of the effective model .",
    "another method consists in performing factorization and large @xmath137 expansion directly in the effective model .",
    "this is possible , since the degrees of freedom of the effective models discussed here are , at least as the quantum numbers are concerned , identical to the degrees of freedom of qcd ( except for gluons , which are not present in the former case ) .",
    "this means , however , that the low energy model has to be applied to the processes with large momenum transfer . since the currents of the effetive models are not the same as in qcd , extra pieces contributing to the da s , as compared to the previous method , are present .",
    "although in this work we have not calculated the physical process and have not implemented the bjorken limit , our approach is in our opinion equivalent , since we have considered the matrix element ( [ amuel ] ) of the full current ( [ atilde ] ) .",
    "our results indicate that these two methods lead to completely different da s .",
    "the first method gives the @xmath5da resembling the asymptotic distribution , whereas the second approach generates the da which is compatible with a constant .",
