    "the idea that supersymmetry is an approximate symmetry of nature , broken at a ` low ' scale , is best and most concretely motivated by two general arguments .",
    "first , it addresses the question of why radiative corrections to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , due to the exchange of virtual particles at some much larger unification or planck scale , do not pull the electroweak scale to a much higher value ( the gauge hierarchy problem  @xcite ) .",
    "second , it brings the unification of couplings calculation , which does not quite work if we use only the particles of the standard model , into adequate agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "however neither of these arguments , on the face of it , yields very specific constraints on the spectrum of masses of the supersymmetric ( @xmath0-parity odd ) partners of ordinary ( @xmath0-parity even ) particles : the first because it is inherently semi - quantitative , the second because it depends on these masses only logarithmically .",
    "on the other hand , it is becoming notorious that the existence of superpartners with masses below 1 tev is difficult to reconcile with established limits on various flavor violating effects , unless one assumes accurate degeneracy of squarks and of sleptons .",
    "even if one assumes such degeneracy , supersymmetric contributions to @xmath1 violation and ( in unified theories ) proton decay become uncomfortably large , unless the squarks and sleptons are heavy .",
    "therefore one is motivated to examine supersymmetric models with large scalar superpartner masses .",
    "the issue immediately arises : to what extent can such models , when critically scrutinized , embody the motivating features we mentioned in our opening paragraph ?",
    "recently it has been argued , using a seemingly reasonable objective definition of naturalness , that all squark and slepton masses can be taken well above 1 tev with no loss of naturalness  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical basis of this result is the existence of focus points in renormalization group trajectories , which render the weak scale ( _ i.e. _ , the higgs potential ) largely insensitive to variations in unknown supersymmetry parameters  @xcite .",
    "we should note that while in these models the squark and slepton masses are unusually large ( compared to conventional wisdom ) , the electroweak gaugino and higgsino particle masses are generically well below 1 tev .    in the focus point models , moreover ,",
    "the quantitative aspect of the unification of coupling constants is actually slightly improved relative to more traditional supersymmetry models , reducing the need for significant high scale threshold corrections  @xcite .    besides preserving and sharpening the original motivations for supersymmetry , the focus point models with heavy scalars ameliorate the problems noted above  @xcite .",
    "specifically , constraints on @xmath1 violation from electric dipole moments can be satisfied even with @xmath2 phases in the fundamental parameters , and the predicted rate for nucleon decay  being proportional to the square of gaugino and inversely proportional to the fourth power of squark / slepton masses  is suppressed and less dangerous , though still perhaps accessible .    in this note",
    "we will consider the implications of focus point supersymmetry for neutralino dark matter .",
    "we will concentrate on the focus point mechanism in its simplest ` default ' incarnation , assuming a universal scalar mass within minimal supergravity .",
    "the focus point mechanism can also be realized in alternative models featuring gravity-  @xcite , gauge-  @xcite , and anomaly - mediated  @xcite supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , the requirement of a universal scalar mass , though sufficient , is not necessary . for the precise set of requirements ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "of course , the cosmology of minimal supergravity ( with universal scalar mass @xmath3 ) has been studied extensively .",
    "prominent among conclusions one finds in the literature are the following :    \\(i ) in essentially all of parameter space , the lightest neutralino @xmath4 is bino - like , with gaugino fraction @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "( see below for the definition of @xmath6 . )",
    "\\(ii ) the neutralino relic abundance @xmath7 increases as @xmath8 increases .",
    "the requirement that neutralinos not overclose the universe , along with the requirement that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) be neutral , then typically leads to stringent upper bounds on scalar and/or gaugino masses , independent of naturalness considerations  @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) dark matter detection rates decrease as @xmath8 increases .",
    "the rates predicted range widely over parameter space , but the prospects for discovery at ongoing experiments grow increasingly dim as @xmath8 increases  @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we confirm these conclusions  for @xmath9 .",
    "however , we find that they fail for focus point models with @xmath10 . instead , we find that in such models :    \\(i ) the lightest neutralino is a gaugino - higgsino mixture over much of parameter space .",
    "\\(ii ) neutralino relic abundances do not overclose the universe .",
    "rather , they tend to lie in the cosmologically interesting range .",
    "therefore , in particular , cosmological considerations alone do not place stringent upper limits on superpartner masses , even apart from possible conspiracies involving poles  @xcite or co - annihilation  @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) direct detection rates may be fairly large , with proton - neutralino cross sections plausibly falling within the range @xmath11-@xmath12 pb .",
    "( see the more detailed discussion and plots below . )",
    "these results are especially interesting since ongoing and planned dark matter detection experiments promise to cover the indicated range .",
    "the models we consider , like many supersymmetric models , contain a natural cold dark matter candidate  @xcite . assuming that @xmath13 is accurately conserved , the lightest supersymmetric ( @xmath0-odd ) particle is stable .",
    "we will be considering models where , with no special adjustment , this is a neutral weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , which is commonly called the neutralino .    the relic densities and detection rates of neutralino dark matter",
    "can be calculated , assuming straightforward extrapolation of big bang cosmology to @xmath14  @xcite . in principle",
    "they depend on details of the entire supersymmetric spectrum , but in practice , especially in focus point models , they are mainly determined by the properties of the neutralino lsp itself .    assuming @xmath0-parity conservation and minimal field content , at tree level the neutralino mass matrix is @xmath15 in the basis @xmath16 .",
    "here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the soft bino and wino masses , @xmath19 is the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath20 is the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "we parametrize the gaugino / higgsino content of the lightest neutralino according to @xmath21 and define the gaugino fraction of @xmath4 to be @xmath22    in the framework of minimal supergravity , there are 4 continuous parameters and 1 binary choice : @xmath23 here , @xmath8 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are , respectively , the universal scalar mass , gaugino mass , and trilinear scalar coupling at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath26 . given values for these input parameters , all the couplings and masses of the weak scale lagrangian are determined through renormalization group ( rg ) evolution .",
    "in our work we use two - loop rg equations  @xcite and include one - loop threshold corrections from supersymmetric particles to the gauge and yukawa coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "we minimize the higgs potential after including all one - loop effects , and include one - loop corrections in all superpartner masses  @xcite .",
    "this framework imposes several specific relations among the weak scale supersymmetry parameters .",
    "in particular , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is fixed by the condition of electroweak symmetry breaking , which , at tree - level , is @xmath29 where the last relation is valid for moderate and large @xmath30 .",
    "the essence of the focus point mechanism is the observation that the weak scale value of @xmath31 is remarkably insensitive to variations in the fundamental gut scale supersymmetry parameters , even for multi - tev @xmath8 . by eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) , therefore , for @xmath32  @xcite , the electroweak scale is insensitive to variations in these parameters , and in this sense multi - tev values of @xmath8 are natural .",
    "contours of gaugino fraction @xmath6 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfraction ] .",
    "( for reference , contours for the fine - tuning parameter @xmath33 , as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , are also given in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfraction ] . while large @xmath34 leads to large fine - tuning , large @xmath8 does not , as a result of the focus point discussed above . ) for @xmath3 , the lightest neutralino is nearly pure bino , with @xmath35 .",
    "this well - known result arises from the circumstance that rg evolution typically drives @xmath31 large ( relative to the gaugino masses ) and negative , which by eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) implies @xmath28 much larger than @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath10 , however , @xmath4 contains significant amounts of higgsino over much of the parameter space . for large and moderate values of @xmath30 ,",
    "large values of @xmath8 generate positive corrections to @xmath31 , rendering it less negative .",
    "thus if all other parameters are fixed , we find that as @xmath8 increases , @xmath28 decreases , and eventually @xmath36 , which leads to significant mixing between higgsino and gaugino states .",
    "as @xmath8 increases further , the higgsino content of @xmath4 increases until ultimately one enters the domain @xmath37 , which is excluded by limits from chargino searches at lep ii  @xcite . at that point , we have entered the shaded region of fig .",
    "[ fig : gfraction ] .",
    "note that the above discussion holds for @xmath38 where the focus point mechanism is operative . for small @xmath30",
    ", @xmath19 becomes sensitive to @xmath39 , and large @xmath8 gives _ negative _ contributions to @xmath31 .",
    "both of these effects imply that , as @xmath8 increases , @xmath28 also increases , and so there is no mixed gaugino - higgsino region for small @xmath30 .",
    "there is ample and increasingly precise evidence that the energy density of the universe is not dominated by the observed luminous matter  @xcite .",
    "the evidence is conveniently expressed in terms of ratios @xmath40 , where the @xmath41 are energy densities and @xmath42 is the critical density , and @xmath43 , the hubble parameter in units of 100 km s@xmath44 mpc@xmath44 .",
    "the luminous matter density is roughly @xmath45 , and the successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis require baryon density @xmath46 . at the same time , rotation curves of spiral galaxies require matter density @xmath47 , and a variety of observations , ranging from the velocities of galaxies within galactic clusters to the luminosities of type ia supernovae , favor values in the range @xmath48 .",
    "there is therefore a need for both baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter . for non - baryonic dark matter , which is of interest here ,",
    "galactic rotation curves require @xmath49 , and large scale measurements suggest @xmath50 .",
    "neutralinos remain in thermal equilibrium until their pair annihilation rate drops below the hubble expansion rate . the relic density of neutralinos is therefore determined primarily by their cross section for pair annihilation in the early universe .",
    "neutralinos annihilate to fermion pairs through the @xmath51-channel exchange of sfermions @xmath52 , and via @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the @xmath1-odd higgs boson , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the lighter and heavier @xmath1-even higgs bosons . when kinematically accessible , annihilation to two body states of gauge and higgs bosons are also relevant",
    ".    the calculation of neutralino relic density has been discussed at length in the literature .",
    "we use the results of drees and nojiri  @xcite , as implemented by jungman , kamionkowski , and griest  @xcite . @xmath57- and",
    "@xmath58-wave contributions to all tree - level processes with two - body final states are included .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] we display the neutralino relic density @xmath7 in the @xmath59 plane for two representative values of @xmath30 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "these plots exhibit the most important parameter dependencies .",
    "variations in @xmath25 within its natural range have little effect , as the @xmath54 parameter flows to a fixed point at the weak scale .",
    "similarly , changing the sign of @xmath19 does not produce qualitatively new results .",
    "we have chosen the sign less constrained by @xmath62 ( see below ) .    in",
    "most of parameter space , the expected accuracy in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] is @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "more significant errors are possible in special regions .",
    "first , a more refined treatment is necessary just below annihilation thresholds  @xcite .",
    "such a treatment will smooth out the kinks in the contours of fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] , which are caused by the opening of annihilation channels such as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "second , co - annihilation is important very near the left and right borders of the allowed region , where the lsp is nearly degenerate with staus  @xcite and higgsinos  @xcite , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath66-channel poles also require a more careful analysis  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath67 pole possibility , @xmath68 , is now essentially eliminated by the chargino mass bound of 95 gev  @xcite , but a @xmath55 pole is possible near the bottom of the allowed region , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath54 poles , though possibly significant for high @xmath30 in the @xmath3 region  @xcite , are absent for @xmath10 for all @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "( the sign of @xmath19 enters through the finite supersymmetric threshold corrections to the bottom yukawa coupling  @xcite . ) thus , although special effects warrant more sophisticated analysis in limited regions of parameter space , they are absent in the bulk of the focus point region .",
    "they do not affect our main conclusions .    for sub - tev @xmath8 , we see that @xmath7 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath8 . in this region ,",
    "the lsp is nearly bino - like , and so the dominant process is @xmath71 through @xmath51-channel @xmath52 exchange . as @xmath8 and @xmath72 increase , this annihilation process is suppressed , and the relic density grows",
    "this behavior , along with the requirement of a neutral lsp , has led many authors to conclude that upper bounds on the relic density typically impose stringent upper limits on superpartner masses  @xcite .",
    "as these results are independent of , and less subjective than , considerations based on naturalness or the fine structure of gauge coupling unification , they have often been taken , by the authors themselves or others , as robust phenomenological upper bounds . if correct , this conclusion would have important implications for supersymmetry searches at the tevatron and the lhc , and in planning for future linear colliders  @xcite .",
    "but when we consider @xmath10 , motivated by the focus point or otherwise , we find that the behavior of this function reverses .",
    "the reason for this behavior is not difficult to locate . for",
    "although as @xmath8 increases the @xmath51-channel sfermion exchange process is more and more suppressed , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutralinos ] , at the same time the lsp gradually acquires a significant higgsino component .",
    "because of this , other diagrams become unsuppressed , and pair annihilation again becomes efficient .",
    "the cosmologically interesting region , with a mixed gaugino - higgsino lsp and @xmath73 , extends at least to @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus , for all collider applications , cosmological considerations do _ not _ provide upper bounds on superpartner masses , even in the constrained framework of minimal supergravity .",
    "it has been noted previously that cosmological bounds might be weakened or eliminated by the effects of co - annihilation  @xcite or poles  @xcite .",
    "here , we see that even without appealing to such conspiratorial effects , sweeping claims that cosmology provides stringent upper bounds on superpartner masses are unfounded .",
    "note that the cosmologically interesting region of parameter space with @xmath77 is in no sense small . for fixed @xmath34 ,",
    "this region extends over one to several hundred gev in @xmath8 , depending on @xmath30 .",
    "it is comparable in area to the allowed region with @xmath3 .    for all @xmath38",
    ", we find relic densities in the cosmologically interesting range @xmath78 over most of the focus point regime with @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : omega ] , for @xmath80 , @xmath7 never saturates the upper bound , even for @xmath81 .",
    "this additional suppression of @xmath7 is not due to any enhancement of the lsp s higgsino component from large @xmath30 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfraction ] , the gaugino purity of the lsp is largely independent of @xmath30 .",
    "rather it results from two enhancements to the process @xmath82 .",
    "first , the @xmath83 coupling is proportional to @xmath30 for isospin @xmath84 fermions .",
    "second , for large @xmath30 , the bottom yukawa coupling @xmath85 becomes significant and lowers @xmath86 .",
    "this can be seen by noting that , for @xmath87 , symmetry under interchange @xmath88 implies that @xmath39 also has a weak scale focus point , and so @xmath89 .    for small @xmath30 , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutralinos ] , there is no mixed gaugino - higgsino region for large @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath7 grows monotonically as @xmath8 increases .",
    "low values of @xmath30 , such as @xmath90 , have been widely considered in the literature .",
    "they are , however , increasingly disfavored by current null results in higgs searches , and , in any case , are less natural than moderate and large values , as low @xmath30 typically leads to large values of @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "having shown that focus point models predict cosmologically interesting densities of dark matter , we now consider their predictions for dark matter detection rates .",
    "the interactions of neutralinos with matter are dominated by scalar ( spin - independent ) couplings  @xcite .",
    "these interactions are mediated either by @xmath51-channel @xmath55 and @xmath56 exchange , or via @xmath91 .",
    "the former diagrams contain @xmath92 and @xmath93 vertices , which are suppressed for bino - like @xmath4 .",
    "they also contain @xmath94-nucleon vertices .",
    "these are dominated by contributions arising from fundamental couplings of @xmath94 to the strange quark and indirectly to gluons through heavy quark loops .    in the calculation of dark matter",
    "detection rates , we assume a maxwellian @xmath4 velocity distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath95 , and a local dark matter density of @xmath96 .",
    "a major uncertainty in the estimate of dark matter detection rates arises from the poorly determined value of the nucleon matrix element @xmath97 if it is correct to treat the effect of the strange quark mass term @xmath98 in first order perturbation theory , then we can identify @xmath99 as the fractional change in the nucleon mass from what it would be in a world with massless @xmath66 quarks .",
    "values as high as @xmath100 and as low as @xmath101 have been considered in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the traditional strategy for evaluating @xmath99 is to combine an ` experimental ' determination of the @xmath102-term @xmath103 with a fit of the flavor @xmath104-breaking term @xmath105 to the baryon octet splitting , and finally the ratios of light quark masses from the @xmath106 mass ratio .",
    "this procedure is problematic , however , in several ways .",
    "first , theory relates the value of the @xmath102 term to the value of the @xmath107 scattering amplitude at an unphysical point , and a rather elaborate and numerically unstable extrapolation is necessary ( hence the quotation marks ) .",
    "second , in getting to the quantity of interest , the uncertainty in the @xmath102 term is amplified by the large factor @xmath108 .",
    "third , the nucleon matrix element of the @xmath104 breaking term is presumably dominated by the valence quark terms , so that the term of interest is subdominant .",
    "fourth , and exacerbating all these , the use of first - order perturbation theory for the baryon splittings is questionable to begin with",
    ".    clearly it would be very desirable to have a first - principles estimate of @xmath99 .",
    "straightforward evaluation in lattice gauge theory appears very difficult , because three - point amplitudes with disconnected components are noisy and computationally demanding .",
    "here we would like to suggest an alternative strategy that avoids any measurement of three - point amplitudes .",
    "the basic idea is to vary the strange quark mass , starting with a very large value and bringing it down by small increments . in the heavy quark limit",
    "we have a universal answer by integrating out the heavy quark to obtain a gluon operator , which is ( essentially ) the trace of the energy - momentum tensor with a definite coefficient  @xcite . and if we change the strange quark mass by a small amount @xmath109 , we have for the induced change in the nucleon mass @xmath110 by first - order perturbation theory . of course",
    ", it is implicit in this procedure that one is doing a fully unquenched calculation , with dynamical quarks ( including the strange quark ) .",
    "since the error is at least quadratic in the step size , one should achieve good accuracy by taking the steps sufficiently small .",
    "note that , since the nucleon state is changing at each step of the calculation , it is not correct to do the whole thing in one jump , despite the apparent linearity of eq .",
    "( [ mstrick ] ) . in any case , eq .",
    "( [ mstrick ] ) allows one to extract the matrix element of interest by measuring masses only , without ever involving three - point functions .",
    "no result of this type is currently available , and so at present one must rely on informed guesswork for a numerical estimate of @xmath99 .",
    "there is a very extensive literature on the subject , which we will not review here .",
    "we will confine ourselves to two brief observations .    if one treats the strange quark as heavy , rather than light",
    ", then one obtains the universal value @xmath111 .",
    "this is presumably a lower limit .",
    "but of course if one takes the strange quark mass to zero , then @xmath99 will likewise vanish .",
    "thus , in considering values of @xmath99 that are many times the heavy quark value , one is implicitly postulating that this quantity varies very rapidly as a function of @xmath112 , which may be implausible",
    ".    quenched calculations of the nucleon to rho mass ratio , and even more so calculations with two dynamical quarks , agree remarkably well with experiment , down to the few percent level .",
    "this fact can only be consistent with the idea that the strange quark is significantly perturbing the nucleon mass if the strange quark contributes an accurately equal proportion of the rho mass .",
    "in general , that would seem to require a conspiracy .",
    "just such a `` conspiracy '' does take place for heavy quarks , since they can be integrated out in favor of a charge renormalization , whose primary effect is just to change the overall mass scale ( dimensional transmutation ) .",
    "however , as we have seen , if it is valid to treat the strange quark as heavy , then its contribution is small .",
    "while these considerations are far from definitive , they do seem to us to make the larger end of the range of values discussed for @xmath99 appear dubious . in preparing our plots ,",
    "we have adopted the conventional value @xmath113 . for extreme values in the range quoted above",
    ", the proton - neutralino cross sections plotted may decrease by roughly a factor of 2 , or increase by a factor of 5 .    in fig .",

    "it has been argued that the regions of parameter space which give large dark matter detection rates may also predict large rates for other processes , such as proton decay  @xcite and @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "conversely , present bounds from such processes may exclude the largest possible rates for dark matter detection .",
