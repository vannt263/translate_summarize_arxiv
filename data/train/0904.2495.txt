    "blood cell production process is based upon the differentiation of so - called hematopoietic stem cells , located in the bone marrow .",
    "these undifferentiated and unobservable cells have unique capacities of differentiation ( the ability to produce cells committed to one of the three blood cell types : red blood cells , white cells or platelets ) and self - renewal ( the ability to produce cells with the same properties ) .",
    "mathematical modelling of hematopoietic stem cells dynamics has been introduced at the end of the seventies by mackey @xcite .",
    "he proposed a system of two differential equations with delay where the time delay describes the cell cycle duration . in this model ,",
    "hematopoietic stem cells are separated in proliferating and nonproliferating cells , these latter being introduced in the proliferating phase with a nonlinear rate depending only upon the nonproliferating cell population .",
    "the resulting system of delay differential equations is then uncoupled , with the nonproliferating cells equation containing the whole information about the dynamics of the hematopoietic stem cell population .",
    "the stability analysis of the model in @xcite highlighted the existence of periodic solutions , through a hopf bifurcation , describing in some cases diseases affecting blood cells , characterized by periodic oscillations @xcite .",
    "the model of mackey @xcite has been studied by many authors , mainly since the beginning of the nineties .",
    "mackey and rey @xcite numerically studied the behavior of a structured model based on the model in @xcite , stressing the existence of strange behaviors of the cell populations ( like oscillations , or chaos ) .",
    "mackey and rudnicky @xcite developed the description of blood cell dynamics through an age - maturity structured model , stressing the influence of hematopoietic stem cells on blood production .",
    "their model has been further developed by dyson et al .",
    "@xcite , adimy and pujo - menjouet @xcite , adimy and crauste @xcite and adimy et al .",
    "recently , adimy et al .",
    "@xcite studied the model proposed in @xcite taking into account that cells in cycle divide according to a density function ( usually gamma distributions play an important role in cell cycles durations ) , contrary to what has been assumed in the above - cited works , where the division has always been assumed to occur at the same time .",
    "more recently , pujo - menjouet and mackey @xcite and pujo - menjouet et al .",
    "@xcite gave a better insight into the model of mackey @xcite , highlighting the role of each parameter of the model on the appearance of oscillations and , more particularly , of periodic solutions , when the model is applied to the study of chronic myelogenous leukemia @xcite .",
    "contrary to the assumption used in all of the above - cited works , we study , in this paper , the model introduced by mackey @xcite considering that the rate of introduction in the proliferating phase , which contains the nonlinearity of this model , depends upon the total population of hematopoietic stem cells , and not only upon the nonproliferating cell population .",
    "the introduction in cell cycle is partly known to be a consequence of an activation of hematopoietic stem cells due to molecules fixing on them .",
    "hence , the entire population is in contact with these molecules and it is reasonable to think that the total number of hematopoietic stem cells plays a role in the introduction of nonproliferating cells in the proliferating phase .",
    "the first consequence is that the model is not uncoupled , and the nonproliferating cell population equation does not contain the whole information about the dynamics of blood cell production , contrary to the model in @xcite . therefore , we are lead to the study of a modified system of delay differential equations ( system ( [ eqs])([eqn2 ] ) ) , where the delay describes the cell cycle duration , with a nonlinear part depending on one of the two populations .    secondly , while studying the local asymptotic stability of the steady states of our model , we have to determine roots of a characteristic equation taking the form of a first degree exponential polynomial with delay - dependent coefficients . for such equations , beretta and",
    "kuang @xcite developed a very useful and powerful technic , that we will apply to our model .",
    "our aim is to show , through the study of the steady states stability , that our model , described in ( [ eqs])([eqn2 ] ) , exhibits similar properties than the model in @xcite and that it can be used to model blood cells production dynamics with good results , in particularly when one is interested in the appearance of periodic solutions in blood cell dynamics models .",
    "we want to point out that the usually accepted assumption about the introduction rate may be limitative and that our model can display interesting dynamics , such as stability switches , that have never been noted before .",
    "the present work is organized as follows . in the next section we present our model ,",
    "stated in equations ( [ eqs ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "we then determine the steady states of this model . in section [ sceas ] ,",
    "we linearize the system ( [ eqs])([eqn2 ] ) about a steady state and we deduce the associated characteristic equation . in section [ stss ] , we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of the trivial steady state ( which describes the extinction of the hematopoietic stem cell population ) . in section [ spss ] ,",
    "we focus on the asymptotic stability of the unique nontrivial steady state . by studying the existence of pure imaginary roots of a first degree exponential polynomial with delay - dependent coefficients ,",
    "we obtain the existence of a critical value of the time delay for which a hopf bifurcation occurs at the positive steady state , leading to the appearance of periodic solutions . using numerical illustrations ,",
    "we show how these solutions can be related to periodic hematological diseases in section [ snum ] , and we note the existence of a stability switch .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "let consider a population of hematopoietic stem cells , located in the bone marrow .",
    "these cells actually perform a succession of cell cycles , in order to differentiate in blood cells ( white cells , red blood cells and platelets ) . according to early works , by burns and tannock @xcite for example",
    ", we assume that cells in cycle are divided in two groups : proliferating and nonproliferating cells . the respective proliferating and nonproliferating cell populations",
    "are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "all hematopoietic stem cells die with constant rates , namely @xmath2 for proliferating cells and @xmath3 for nonproliferating cells .",
    "these latter are introduced in the proliferating phase , in order to mature and divide , with a rate @xmath4 . at the end of the proliferating phase , cells divide in two daughter cells which immediately enter the nonproliferating phase .",
    "then the populations @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfy the following evolution equations ( see mackey @xcite or pujo - menjouet and mackey @xcite ) , @xmath5 in each of the above equations , @xmath6 denotes the average duration of the proliferating phase .",
    "the term @xmath7 then describes the survival rate of proliferating cells .",
    "the last terms in the right hand side of equations ( [ eqp ] ) and ( [ eqn ] ) account for cells that have performed a whole cell cycle and leave ( enter , respectively ) the proliferating phase ( the nonproliferating phase , respectively ) .",
    "these cells are in fact nonproliferating cells introduced in the proliferating phase a time @xmath6 earlier .",
    "the factor 2 in equation ( [ eqn ] ) represents the division of each proliferating hematopoietic stem cell in two daughter cells .",
    "we assume that the rate of introduction @xmath4 depends upon the total population of hematopoietic stem cells , that we denote by @xmath8 . with our notations , @xmath9 .",
    "this assumption stresses the fact that the nature of the trigger signal for introduction in the proliferating phase is the result of an action on the entire cell population .",
    "for example , it can be caused by molecules entering the bone marrow and fixing on hematopoietic stem cells , activating or inhibiting their proliferating capacity .",
    "this occurs in particularly for the production of red blood cells .",
    "their regulation is mainly mediated by an hormone ( a growth factor , in fact ) called erythropoietin , produced by the kidneys under a stimulation by circulating blood cells ( see blair et al .",
    "@xcite , mahaffy et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "hence we assume that @xmath10 the function @xmath4 is supposed to be continuous and positive on @xmath11 , and strictly decreasing .",
    "this latter assumption describes the fact that the less hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow , the more cells introduced in the proliferative compartment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath12    adding equations ( [ eqp ] ) and ( [ eqn ] ) we can then deduce an equation satisfied by the total population of hematopoietic stem cells @xmath13 .",
    "we assume , for the sake of simplicity , that proliferating and nonproliferating cells die with the same rate , that is @xmath14 .",
    "then the populations @xmath1 and @xmath8 satisfy the following nonlinear system with time delay @xmath6 , corresponding to the cell cycle duration , @xmath15    from hale and verduyn lunel @xcite , for each continuous initial condition , system ( [ eqs])([eqn2 ] ) has a unique continuous solution @xmath16 , well - defined for @xmath17 .",
