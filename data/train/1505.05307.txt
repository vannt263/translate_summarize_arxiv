    "quantum systems in an external magnetic field exhibit various unexpected and interesting features . in condensed matter physics , quantum hall effect and fractional quantum hall effect were discovered in two - dimensional electron systems in 1970s and 1980s  @xcite .",
    "more recently , quantum spin hall effect was proposed to exist in special two - dimensional electron systems with strong spin - orbit couplings  @xcite , and quantum anomalous hall effect was found in a ferromagnetic material chromium - doped ( bi , sb)2te3 in 2013  @xcite . for a dense non - relativistic system , the de haas ",
    "van alphan oscillation was observed in some thermodynamic systems  @xcite . in high energy physics , this oscillation is found in nuclear and quark matters  @xcite .",
    "it is beyond our expectation that the magnetic field reduces the critical temperature of chiral symmetry restoration in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , known as the inverse magnetic catalysis  @xcite .    in high energy",

    "besides a very strong magnetic field ( up to @xmath0 at the lhc energy ) created in the early stage of heavy ion collisions , the randomly generated chiral imbalance plays also an important role in the hot medium . in neutron stars where the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential are both very large , chiral current can be induced along the magnetic field by triangle anomalies  @xcite .",
    "the chiral current will eventually cause chiral separation and generate chiral imbalance which can be quite large in the two hemispheres along the magnetic field . while the chiral imbalance or instead chiral chemical potential @xmath1 together with the magnetic field @xmath2 created by the spectators have been widely investigated in the study of chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite at finite temperature , it is still an open question how the chiral imbalance and magnetic field affect pion superfluidity at finite isospin density and color superconductivity at finite baryon density .",

    "the model calculation at hadron level shows a magnetic catalysis which is inconsistent with the lattice simulation at quark level .",
    "the color superconductivity in an external magnetic field is not so complicated as pion superfluidity .",
