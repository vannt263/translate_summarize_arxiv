    "two decades ago , @xcite demonstrated through numerical models that gravitational interactions between galaxies can generate spectacular tidal features . in earlier work , @xcite already proposed that collisions between giant galaxies may result in the ejection of stars and gas into the intergalactic space , resulting in the formation of star clusters and star forming dwarf galaxies .",

    "a qualitative comparison with numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". this figure would be difficult to change since in order to make both galaxies comparable in size , a hubble constant smaller than @xmath58 would be required .",
    "it is also difficult to invoke an error in the derived mass for ngc6845a due to an error in the disk inclination since , even by assuming an edge - on position for this galaxy , we could not reduce the derived mass by more than a factor of 1.5 .",
    "@xcite pointed already out that ngc6845a should have a large mass because of its uncommonly large maximum velocity .",
    "we note that their rotation curve extends only up to @xmath59 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the tidal bridge of ngc6845a shows a decreasing trend in radial velocity ( see fig  [ fig : zoomvel ] and tab  [ tab : flux ] ) starting from its base , where it is connected to the ngc6845a disk near region 8 ( at 6660@xmath60 ) , and passing through regions 3 , 2 and 1 , located more or less in the middle of the tidal bridge ( at 6455@xmath60 , 6361@xmath60 and 6272@xmath60 , respectively ) .",
    "regions 4 and 5 , which are slightly shifted to the north with respect to the prolongation of the bridge , surprisingly present radial velocities that agree with this trend ( 6314@xmath60 and 6201@xmath60 , respectively ) , strongly suggesting that they are linked to the tidal bridge and not to ngc6845b , despite the fact that they are seen projected on top of this object .",
    "we also detected on the tidal bridge , with a mean velocity of 6350@xmath60 , in agreement with the optical results ( see next section ) .",
    "supposing that the tidal bridge tip follows a parabolic orbit in the plane of ngc6845a disk and its present true velocity is the observed radial velocity of the regions 4 and 5 , we obtain a collision age of @xmath61150300myr . since regions can not be older than 10myr ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : knots ] ) , this implies that star formation activity occurs inside the tidal bridge , started well after the beginning of the bridge formation .",
    "a possible scenario for the bridge late star formation come out from @xcite simulations .",
    "these authors found that self  gravitating star clumps forms along tidal tails after a collision .",
    "the gas clouds torn apart from the galactic disk simultaneously with the stars may fall into these clumps , reaching the necessary density in order to form stars .",
    "cloud collisions inside the tidal bridge may be an alternative mechanism to explain the star formation inside the bridge .",

    "the simulation shows that about 10% of the gas originally belonging to galaxy a would be captured by galaxy c , which is neither observed as nor as .",
    "the simulation also shows that stars stripped out from a should form a stellar feature perpendicular to c disk , also not detected in the optical images , which present a high degree of symmetry to intermediate brightness levels .",
    "[ fig : simulab ] shows the encounter of model a with the point mass b , under a prograde hyperbolic orbit with eccentricity @xmath92 and perigalactic distance @xmath93kpc .",
    "the pericenter is in the direction @xmath94 and its orbital spin vector is parallel to @xmath95 .",
    "the third frame ( 145myr after the perigalacticum , shown in the second frame ) shows the best match of the model to the system present stage . in this frame galaxy b",
    "is receding with respect to a at @xmath96 .",
    "the more striking feature of this simulation is the morphology of the tidal bridge , which is straight and narrow and shows condensations of gas and stars at its base and middle part , resembling the observed tidal bridge morphology .",
    "also the tidal tail is diffuse , as in the real situation . against this scenario",
    "the simulation shows that the tidal tail points in a direction different from the observed one and does not bifurcate .    in spite of both scenarios pros and cons",
    ", the collision of a and b seems to be more appropriate to explain the tidal bridge structure .",
    "although some features associated to galaxy c can be regarded as tidally produced , it can not be ignored the lack of other important features that c should show if it were the main perturber .",
    "perhaps a three  body interaction , with b producing the tidal bridge would be more suitable to explain the richness of features observed in this group .",
    "the system ngc6845 is a compact group in which ngc6845a presents a strong tidal bridge , signature of a close collision .",
    "we present the first atomic hydrogen observation of ngc6845 , obtaining an content 5 times higher than in the case of the milky way .",
    "the distribution can be separated into two components , one related to ngc6845a , sporting well developed tidal features and the second one , with velocity similar to that of ngc6845b .",
    "components c and d do not present , up to our detection limit .",
    "this fact set constrains to galaxy c being the main perturber of a , since , as shown by numerical simulations , in these case gas originally belonging to a should be transferred to c.    ngc6845a optical rotation curve is asymmetric , with a uncommonly high maximum circular velocity , especially to the sw side .",
    "satoh model fitting to the rotation curve indicates the presence of a dominant disk and a small to intermediate bulge , in agreement with the morphological classification of this galaxy .",
    "the derived mass is m@xmath97 . the ( b - i ) color map indicate the presence of dust in front of the sw side of the bar , pointing to a trailing bar .",
    "the ( b - i ) color map also shows that the bridge is bluer than ngc6845a inner disk .",
    "regions brighter than those of the antennae and ngc7252 tidal tails have formed at the tip and at the base of the tidal bridge .",
    "three regions midway along the tidal bridge are brighter than ngc3603 , the brightest one known in our galaxy .",
    "the kinematics of regions 4 and 5 indicates that they are more likely connected to the tidal bridge than to ngc6845b , as their projected position may suggest .",
    "they present luminosities similar to that of 30doradus .",
    "a simple model for the kinematics of the tip of the bridge as well as numerical simulations indicate that star formation is occurring along this structure one hundred million years or more after the perturber closest approach .",
    "the group kinematics calls for dark matter within the system at about 5 times its luminous mass .",
    "the group amount of dark matter would be 9 times higher than the halo mass of the ngc6845a , provided that the is in dynamical equilibrium inside the galaxy ; this in turn would be three times higher than the galaxy kinematical mass derived from the optical rotation curve .",
    "since abundant signs of interactions are present in galaxy b , and to a less extent in c , we appealed to n - body simulations in order to disentangle which of the galaxies , b or c , would be the a main perturber .",
    "both scenarios for the tidal disruption of galaxy a present pros and cons , but the bridge , which is the most conspicuous tidal feature of this galaxy , seems to be better reproduced by the simulation of the encounter of galaxies a and b. the fact that neither nor , that should have been stripped out from galaxy a , are detected in galaxy c reinforce this scenario . perhaps a three body interaction would be a more appropriate scenario to explain the group dynamical evolution , but it is difficult to model due to the large number of degrees of freedom involved such a collision .",
