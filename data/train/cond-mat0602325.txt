    "simulations of complex molecular systems are generally carried out using either the molecular dynamics ( md ) or the monte carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "each method has its own merits .",
    "the md method @xcite , based on the integration of the classical equations of motion of the particles , is conceptually the simpler of the two . with currently available computer power ,",
    "md simulations generally can not be carried out for very long time scales for very large systems , making the extraction of true equilibrium properties often difficult .",
    "the mc method @xcite , on the other hand , relies on stochastic dynamics to generate members of the desired ensemble .",
    "mc has the ability to execute non - physical large - scale transitions that are impossible in md and has the potential to reach equilibrium much faster .",
    "however , devising these large - scale transitions that have reasonable acceptance probabilities is not always straightforward .    to search for ways to enable large - scale transitions to be carried out with higher probability in mc simulations",
    ", one must tackle the core problem , which is the complexity of the interactions among the particles in the system .",
    "if there were no interactions among these particles , any transition , regardless of its scale , would always be accepted .",
    "when a move is made in mc , the interactions involving those particles that are being moved will change .",
    "in general , the larger the scale of the move and the more complicated the interactions are , the larger the change in the potential becomes .",
    "consequently , large - scale mc moves are very unlikely to be accepted .",
    "a natural questions arises : is it possible to reduce the complexity of the interactions among the particles , for instance , by replacing the actual potential @xmath0 by a less complex potential @xmath2 ?",
    "one possibility is proposed in this paper . with this method",
    ", it is indeed possible to replace the original potential @xmath0 by an _ arbitrary _ @xmath1 .",
    "but the procedure has to follow a carefully constructed algorithm to guarantee that detailed balance with respect to the original potential is maintained , so that the correct statistics are produced .",
    "an idea similar to this has been exploited in a number of previously proposed monte carlo methods , such as j - walking @xcite , simulated tempering @xcite , parallel tempering @xcite , catalytic tempering @xcite , multicanonical j - walking @xcite and the approximate potential method @xcite .",
    "but we will show that when generalized to multidimensional systems , the present method provides flexibilities and potential advantages that are not available with these previous methods and establishes a theoretical framework for the design of possibly more efficient algorithms for simulating complex systems .",
    "let @xmath3 be the configuration of a @xmath4-dimensional system and @xmath5 the potential energy divided by the boltzmann constant @xmath6 .",
    "the statistical weight of each member of the canonical ensemble is @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the absolute temperature .",
    "a mc algorithm that generates configurations consistent with their statistical weights can be constructed from any set of transition rules , as long as the transition probabilities @xmath9 between every pair @xmath3 and @xmath10 satisfy the detailed balance condition : @xmath11    the new mc algorithm we propose proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "first , consider changing the system potential @xmath0 to an arbitrary potential @xmath1 .",
    "this `` potential switching '' decision is carried out with a stochastic switching probability @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a constant greater than or equal to the maximum value of @xmath15 over _ all _ @xmath3 . by incorporating @xmath14 into eqn.([eq : s ] ) , we ensure that @xmath16 is between 0 and 1 .",
    "note that if @xmath14 is very large , the resulting @xmath16 will be small , making switching very infrequent . for systems with a @xmath0 that is bounded from above ,",
    "it is always possible to choose a @xmath1 which yields a finite @xmath14 .",
    "systems with an unbounded @xmath0 will be addressed in sect .",
    "[ sect : generalization ] .",

    "is made ( accepted or rejected ) , the cycle is over and the algorithm returns to step 1 .",
    "this stochastic potential switching ( sps ) idea , with the relevant potential switching and subsequent mc transition probabilities , is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : sps ] .",
    "obviously , the sps algorithm can be used alone in a simulation ( if the moves are ergodic ) or mixed with other mc moves .",

    ". therefore , the mc trajectory generated by this sps idea will produce a sequence of configurations @xmath26 that is consistent with the canonical ensemble for a system with potential @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the choice of @xmath1 is completely arbitrary  the proof works for all @xmath1 . in a real application , one can exploit this arbitrariness to select a @xmath1 that may be either less complex than the original @xmath0 or less costly to compute . for a system where the potential is a sum of additive terms @xmath27 ,",
    "often the case for many - particle systems , the switching decision can be applied to each @xmath28 separately",
    ". this generalization will be described in sect .",
    "[ sect : generalization ] .    in form described above",
    ", the sps idea is conceptually related to j - walking @xcite , parallel tempering @xcite , and the `` approximate potential '' method @xcite . in j - walking ,",
    "the simulation is stochastically switched to a configuration sampled from a higher - temperature ( @xmath29 ) simulation of the same potential with properly chosen transition probabilities .",
    "this is essentially the same as using a potential that is attenuated by a factor @xmath30 as @xmath1 in sps .",
    "similarly , in parallel tempering , the exchange of replicas between two different temperatures is equivalent to having one switched to an attenuated potential and the other to a higher potential . in the approximate potential method ,",
    "the simulation is switched to an approximate potential , and the new configuration produced on the approximate potential is accepted or reject at the end with a `` correction '' rate that is designed to maintain detailed balance with respect to the original potential ; whereas in sps , the switching decision is made _ before _ the move , so that the subsequent update on @xmath1 will always be accepted . even though sps is conceptually akin to these other methods , we will show in sect .",
    "[ sect : generalization ] that when sps is generalized to multidimensional systems , its offers flexibilities and potential advantages that are not currently available in these related methods .",
    "we use a simple one - dimensional example to illustrate the basic sps idea .",
    "the model we selected was a harmonic potential @xmath31 , with @xmath3 confined to within the range @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "we used five different @xmath33 , with @xmath34 = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 to demonstrate that the ensemble averages were indeed invariant with the choice of @xmath1 and the choice of @xmath1 is hence arbitrary . for each of the five @xmath1 , we sampled @xmath3 according to the sps algorithm using simple metropolis moves on both @xmath1 and @xmath23",
    ". @xmath35 is a special case , because for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , so the switch is make with unit probability .",

    "@xmath40 is in general lower for those @xmath1 ( particularly @xmath34 = 1 and 3 ) that are very different from the original potential @xmath0 .",

    "a mc method that is capable of executing large - scale moves with high probability was proposed by swendsen and wang @xcite for the ising model in 1987 .",
    "this method later led to the discovery of a class of methods now collectively known as `` cluster algorithms '' @xcite .",
    "these cluster algorithms can be shown to be special cases of the sps algorithm .",
    "whereas these cluster algorithms permit large - scale mc moves , they are largely restricted to discrete models and are not generally applicable to molecular simulations .",

    "after all the interactions have been either deleted or frozen , the spins break up into clusters of spins having frozen interactions .",
    "each cluster can be flipped independently of the others .",
    "swendsen and wang showed that this cluster algorithm satisfies detailed balance and it produces much faster equilibration compared to the conventional metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "the ising model has potential @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and the sum goes over all nearest - neighbor pairs .",
    "it is easy to show that the swendsen - wang algorithm can be derived from the sps algorithm by making the special choice @xmath47 . as such",
    ", the sps algorithm can be considered as a `` generalized '' cluster algorithm .",
    "however , we choose not to use this terminology because calling sps a generalized cluster algorithm would improperly imply some geometric origin .",
    "whereas in discrete systems such as the ising model there is an obvious geometric interpretation for the sps algorithm , there may not be any in more general continuous systems .",
    "while the validity of the sps algorithm is clear for the basic case considered in sect .",
    "[ sect : algorithm ] , the utility of the sps algorithm in this form is rather limited .",
    "there are several reasons why this formulation of the sps algorithm may not be very practical .",
    "( 1 ) the choice of a good @xmath1 is not obvious . ( 2 ) because @xmath16 in eqn .",

    "( 3 ) for a @xmath0 that is not bounded from above ( as in systems with repulsive interactions ) , there may not be a way to choose a @xmath1 that keeps @xmath14 finite .    to make the sps algorithm more useful",

    "any @xmath0 can be decomposed into an arbitrary sum .",
    "some systems , such as those with pairwise interactions , have potentials that break up naturally into a sum of terms .",
    "in other situations , the potential may have two or more distinct parts that are responsible for different physical phenomena , such as the repulsive and attractive part of a lennard - jones potential @xcite .",
    "we will see that the usefulness of the sps algorithm is related to how @xmath0 is decomposed .",
    "our formulation here is inspired by the ideas of kandel _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who have provided a generalization of the swendsen - wang algorithm @xcite for discrete - state ( ising ) models .    to illustrate the generalization of the sps algorithm to a continuous system with an additive potential",
    ", we consider a potential with just two terms @xmath49 .",
    "extension to more than two terms is straightforward .",

    "[ sect : algorithm ] to each of the terms separately , attempting to switch @xmath50 to a new @xmath51 and @xmath52 to another @xmath53 with switching probabilities @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "since the potential terms are additive , the switching of @xmath50 and @xmath52 are independent of each other and can be performed in any order .    for two terms in the potential ,",
    "there are four possible outcomes of the switching decision .",
    "for each one , the next part of the simulation will proceed on a different potential : ( 1 ) if both @xmath50 and @xmath52 are switched , the new potential becomes @xmath56 ; ( 2 ) if both @xmath50 and @xmath52 are not switched , the new potential becomes @xmath57 ; ( 3 ) if @xmath50 is switched but @xmath52 is not , the new potential becomes @xmath58 ; ( 4 ) if @xmath50 is not switched but @xmath52 is , the new potential becomes @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined as in eqn .",

    ", the original potential can be restored to restart the switching process anew .",
    "one can easily show that with this algorithm , detailed balance with respect to the original potential is strictly obeyed along _ any one _ of the four pathways .",
    "this is a direct result of the additivity of @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "the sum over all four pathways therefore also obeys detailed balance .    in the above ,",
    "we have considered switching both terms in @xmath0 , but this needs not be . in fact , we can apply the switching to an arbitrary subset of terms . for example , we may consider switching only @xmath50 to @xmath51 and keeping @xmath52 `` alive '' .",
    "if the switching is successful , the new potential becomes @xmath62 ; otherwise , it is @xmath63 .",
    "this scenario is equivalent to using a @xmath64 and thus also satisfies detailed balance .",
    "this strategy may be useful , for example , in the case of a @xmath0 that is not bounded from above . in this case",
    ", we can decompose the potential into the repulsive ( unbounded ) and attractive ( bounded ) parts , but apply the switching only to the attractive part",
    ".    it should now be clear why decomposing @xmath0 into many additive terms makes the sps algorithm more practical . in the original formulation of the sps algorithm in sect .",
    "[ sect : algorithm ] , the entire @xmath65 is switched to @xmath1 .",
    "the probability for the simultaneous switching of _ all _ @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",
    "if the potential contains a large number of terms , the total switching probability will be small even if each individual @xmath68 is close to unity .",
    "therefore , switching the entire @xmath0 is almost impossible , but individual terms in @xmath0 can be switched with a much higher probability .",
    "coupled with good physical insights , the additivity of @xmath0 can be exploited to devise efficient sps algorithms that may be more optimal than others .",
    "some systems , such as those with pairwise interactions , have a natural decomposition for @xmath0 . this may be used to guide the search for an optimal breakup . on the other hand",
    ", there may be a totally unphysical breakup that affords higher efficiency .",
    "the additivity of @xmath0 offers immense possibilities . in the next section",
    ", we will illustrate this using a nontrivial many - particle example .",
    "in fact , crude elements of the basic sps idea have already appeared in one of our recent studies on the monte carlo simulations of imaginary - time path integrals @xcite , and these ideas have been proven useful for accelerating the sampling of stiff paths .",
    "the strategy proposed there was later implemented in a large - scale path integral simulation of superfluid molecular h@xmath69 clusters @xcite .",

    "the correlation length of a system diverges near the critical point .",
    "small local fluctuations of the system at large separations become correlated with each other , making monte carlo simulations extremely sluggish @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` critical slowing - down '' problem leads to extremely long equilibration time for monte carlo simulations that employ only local updates , such as the conventional metropolis algorithm .",
    "nonlocal moves can also be made using the metropolis algorithm , but such moves are almost always rejected because of the reason given in the last section .",
    "we will demonstrate how the sps method can be used to deal with the critical slowing - down problem in a lennard - jones fluid .",
    "the simulations were carried out in a cubic box with periodic boundary condition . a lennard - jones potential @xmath70 $ ] that is truncated but unshifted at @xmath71",

    "since the heat capacity is expected to diverge as @xmath78 @xcite , the slowing - down problem should be manifested in the energy measurement .",
    "we compared the scaling of the autocorrelation time for the energy estimator with the box length @xmath76 of the sps method against the metropolis algorithm and found a much smaller dynamical scaling exponent for the sps method .",

    "after the switching decision has been completed for every @xmath92 , the particles now interact with a modified potential in which some pairs of particles interact with @xmath99 while the rest have zero attraction between them .",
    "since @xmath91 have been kept alive , every pair of particles also interact through the purely repulsive @xmath91 . at this point",
    ", one can employ any monte carlo move to update the system on this stochastically modified potential .",
    "one simple possibility is to apply a metropolis algorithm with a local update to the sps modified potential , just like on the original potential .",
    "but as we will see , doing this alone will not improve the dynamical characteristics of the sampling .",

    "update methods that employ only local moves will therefore have poor dynamical scaling , since they are unable to effect large - scale rearrangements of the system .",
    "sps provides a basis for designing possibly more efficient alternative update schemes .",
