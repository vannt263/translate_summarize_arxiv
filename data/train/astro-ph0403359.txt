    "for a detailed comparison of the appearance of cluster of galaxies in x - ray and in the optical , we have compiled a large database of x - ray and optical properties of a sample of clusters based on the largest available x - ray and optical surveys : the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the x - ray - selected galaxy clusters of this rass - sdss catalog cover a wide range of masses , from groups of @xmath3 @xmath4 to massive clusters of @xmath5 @xmath4 in the redshift range from 0.002 to 0.45 .",
    "the rass - sdss sample comprises 114 clusters . for each system",
    "we have uniformly determined the x - ray and optical properties . for a subsample of 53 clusters we also compiled the temperature and the iron abundance from the literature .",
    "the cluster optical luminosity is calculated , after statistical background subtraction , as the sum of all the galaxies within the @xmath6 magnitude bins . a tight relation exists between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane ,",
    "the @xmath9 relation is a line with slope 0.44@xmath100.03 and with a scatter of 0.3 .",
    "given the @xmath11 relation of reiprich & bhringer 2001 and our new @xmath12 relation , also the mass should increase faster than @xmath1 . to check this",
    ", we used the subsample of clusters with temperature , and with the @xmath13 relation of finoguenov et al .",
    "2001 we estimated the mass and analysed the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 relations ( m and @xmath1 are calculated both within @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xmath2 shows a clear dependence on the cluster mass with a slope from 0.27 in the i and r bands to 0.22 in the z band .",
    "funding for the creation and distribution of the sdss archive has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national aeronautics and space administration , the national science foundation , the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the japanese monbukagakusho , and the max planck society .",
    "the sdss web site is http://www.sdss.org/. the sdss is managed by the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) for the participating institutions .",
    "the participating institutions are the university of chicago , fermilab , the institute for advanced study , the japan participation group , the johns hopkins university , los alamos national laboratory , the max - planck - institute for astronomy ( mpia ) , the max - planck - institute for astrophysics ( mpa ) , new mexico state university , university of pittsburgh , princeton university , the united states naval observatory , and the university of washington ."

    "<S> solid observational evidences indicate a strong dependence of the galaxy formation and evolution on the environment . in order to study in particular the interaction between the intracluster medium and the evolution of cluster galaxies , </S>",

    "<S> we analyzed the correlation between the total optical and the x - ray cluster luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting correlation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 shows a logarithmic slope of 0.6 , a value close to the self - similar correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we analysed also the cluster mass to light ratio , by finding a significant dependence of @xmath2 on the cluster mass with a logarithmic slope ranging from 0.27 in the i and r bands to 0.22 in the z band . </S>"
