    "in recent years , the possible measurement of the absolute mass scale of neutrinos through @xmath9 decay has become of considerable interest .",
    "this decay takes place only when the neutrino is a majorana particle with finite mass .",
    "its occurrence has not been confirmed yet and is at the present time the subject of many experimental investigations .",
    "concomitant with the @xmath9 there is the @xmath4 decay mode .",
    "this mode is allowed by the standard model and it has now been observed in several nuclei @xcite . while the @xmath9 mode can be safely calculated in the closure approximation , since the average virtual neutrino momentum is of order 100 mev / c and thus well above the scale of nuclear excitations , the closure approximation is not expected to be good for @xmath4 where the neutrino momentum is of order of few mev / c and thus of the same scale of nuclear excitations .",
    "@xmath4 decay without the closure approximation has been calculated within the framework of qrpa @xcite and lssm @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we initiate a new approach to calculate @xmath4 without the closure approximation within the framework of the interacting boson model ( ibm-2 ) and its extensions ( ibfm-2 and ibffm-2 ) @xcite .",
    "this latter model has been used extensively to calculate spectra of odd - even medium mass and heavy mass nuclei ( ibfm-2 ) and of odd - odd nuclei ( ibffm-2 ) @xcite , which are crucial for the calculation of @xmath4 decay . after a description of the ibfm formalism , we proceed to do a calculation of two - neutrino double-@xmath3 decays for @xmath10te@xmath11xe and @xmath12te@xmath13xe .",
    "the aim of the paper is two - fold : ( i ) first and foremost we want to understand what is the mechanism of @xmath4 in te , that is , what intermediate states in the odd - odd nucleus contribute to the decay and ( ii ) from a comparison of our calculated matrix elements with experimental single-@xmath3 and @xmath4 decay , extract the value of the effective axial vector coupling constant , @xmath14 .",
    "the inverse half - life @xmath15 for @xmath16 double-@xmath3 decay has been derived by several authors @xcite . we use here the formulation of tomoda @xcite as adapted in @xcite . for transitions",

    ".nuclei related to the double-@xmath3 decay from @xmath74te . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the calculations reported in the previous subsections are based on contributions of states in the intermediate odd - odd nucleus with @xmath75 mev .",
    "it is of interest to investigate how likely or unlikely is that states above 3 mev could contribute significantly to two - neutrino decay .",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath77 states with @xmath78 mev are built from two contributions : ( 1 ) states constructed from single - particle orbitals within the model space of table [ ta : spe ] ; ( 2 ) states constructed from single - particle orbitals above the shell gap at 82 or below the shell gap at 50 . to investigate the contribution of states with @xmath78 mev within the model space of table [ ta : spe ] , one can simply extend the calculation from the current lowest @xmath79 @xmath76 states and @xmath80 @xmath77 states to larger numbers .",
    "it appears that the properties of the strength distributions remain the same and that therefore states of this type will not contribute significantly to two - neutrino decay .",
    "states constructed from single - particle orbits outside the model space of table [ ta : spe ] will appear in the spectrum at energies above the shell gaps , @xmath81 mev .",
    "we have in fact investigated their contributions by including the proton orbit @xmath82 and the neutron orbit @xmath83 , as in table [ ta : spefi ] , and concluded that also this type of states will not contribute significantly to two - neutrino decay .",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "inclusion of excitations across major shells will give major contributions to the strength distribution for the gt@xmath84 and f@xmath84 `` legs '' , te @xmath5 i , especially in the region @xmath85 mev , where the giant gt resonance ( @xmath86 mev ) and the isobaric analogue state , ias ( @xmath87 mev ) are located .",
    "however , because of their composition in terms of single - particle states , we expect its contribution to the gt@xmath88 ( or f@xmath88 ) `` leg '' , i @xmath5 xe , which will still remain concentrated in few low - lying states , figs .",
    "[ fig : gt128fi ] and [ fig : gt130fi ] , center panel .",
    "it is therefore , in our opinion , quite unlikely that states above 3 mev will contribute significantly to two - neutrino decay .",
    "in this article , a detailed investigation of the ten nuclei : @xmath0te , @xmath0i , @xmath0xe , @xmath1i and @xmath2te , within the framework of the interacting boson model-2 , ibm-2 , and its generalizations ibfm-2 and ibffm-2 has been done .",
    "the parameters needed in this investigation have been obtained as much as possible from the available experimental information .",
    "the wave functions so obtained have been used to calculate single-@xmath3 and @xmath4 matrix elements .",
    "the main results of our investigation are :    1 .",
    "the mechanism of @xmath4 in these nuclei appears to be single - state dominance ( ssd ) .",
    "2 .   the gt strength in @xmath0te ( @xmath89 ) @xmath5 @xmath0i ( @xmath90 )",
    "is evenly distributed .",
    "3 .   the gt strength in @xmath0i ( @xmath90 ) @xmath5 @xmath0xe ( @xmath89 )",
    "is concentrated in one state .",
    "4 .   use of a single value @xmath91 appears to describe well both single-@xmath3 and @xmath4 decay .",
    "the results are very sensitive to the choice of single - particle energies , most notably the weak branch @xmath92 . however",
    ", when the renormalization of @xmath20 is taken into account through fitting the single-@xmath3 decay , different choices of s.  p.  e.  give similar results for @xmath4 , but with varying degree of accuracy .",
    "the best choice appears to be that of the s.  p.  e.  of @xcite which describes all observed quantities fairly : energies , electromagnetic transitions and moments , single-@xmath3 matrix elements , ( @xmath93he , @xmath94 ) strength distributions , and double-@xmath3 matrix elements , in the quenched approximation .",
    "our best estimates of @xmath4 matrix elements are therefore those given in table [ ta : meff ] , @xmath95 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath98 , and of the @xmath4 half - lives @xmath99 ( @xmath100 yr , @xmath99 ( @xmath101 yr",
    ".    our extracted values @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the single - particle levels of table [ ta : spe ] and [ ta : spefi ] , respectively , are rather low .",
    "the values of @xmath14 depend on mass number , @xmath104 , and on the nuclear model used in their extraction . a preliminary study of @xmath14 in the interacting boson model ( ibm-2 ) in the closure approximation for @xmath4 decay and the interacting shell model ( ism ) has been done in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that @xmath14 has a smooth dependence that can be parametrized as @xmath105 plus shell effects .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath106 in the mass region , @xmath107 , are @xmath108 for ibm-2 and @xmath109 for ism .",
    "a similar analysis has been done within the framework of qrpa @xcite with similar results .",
    "we intend to continue the study of @xmath14 within the framework described in the present article to understand how general is the result presented here , and also to study the related question of the extent to which @xmath110 is quenched in heavy nuclei , if at all .",
    "the question of the impact of the small value of @xmath14 found in @xmath3-decay and @xmath4-decay to @xmath9-decay is the subject of much debate .",
    "while only gt ( @xmath76 ) and f ( @xmath77 ) multipoles contribute to allowed @xmath3- and @xmath4-decay , all multipoles ( @xmath111 ... ) , ( @xmath112 ... ) contribute to @xmath9 decay .",
    "it is not clear whether or not the higher multipoles are quenched .",
    "nonetheless , since @xmath76 and @xmath77 still provide the largest contributions , we expect the quenching of @xmath20 and @xmath110 to play an important role in @xmath9 decay . since , in view of the fact that @xmath20 appears to the fourth power in the decay rate , the quenching of @xmath20 has major repercussions on @xmath9 experiments , we plan to investigate this problem in depth in subsequent papers .",
