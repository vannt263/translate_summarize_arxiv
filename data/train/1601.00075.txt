    "since both states are observed in the @xmath7 invariant mass distributions , their minimum quark components should be @xmath8 .",
    "due to the large charm quark mass , these states seem to be no less exotic than the @xmath9 , whose first claim was made by the leps collaboration  @xcite ( see also update in ref .",

    "@xcite to determine invariant masses with an incomplete kinematics .",
    "the apparently exotic nature of the hidden - charm pentaquark states has aroused a lot of theoretical interests to interpret their nature .",
    "for instance , they have been proposed to be meson - baryon molecules  @xcite , diquark - diquark - antiquark pentaquarks  @xcite , compact diquark - triquark pentaquarks  @xcite , @xmath10-soliton states  @xcite , genuine multiquark states  @xcite , and kinematical effects related to the so - called triangle singularity  @xcite .     clearly , not all of the theoretical interpretations are consistent with each other .",
    "the molecular interpretations can not easily accommodate simultaneously the two states with opposite parity , which is not the case for qcd sum rules .",
    "the fact that the fock components in the wave function of a hadronic state are themselves not observable complicated further the discussion . as such",
    ", it has been stressed that to differentiate the various structures it is important to study the production and decay patterns of these pentaquark states , e.g. , the weak decays of bottom baryons  @xcite , photo - productions  @xcite , the @xmath11 reaction  @xcite , elastic and inelastic @xmath12 cross sections  @xcite , and the strong decays of these states  @xcite .",
    "searches for the counterparts of these two states , such as its strangeness counterpart  @xcite , will offer new insight into their true nature as well .",
    "in such a context , it is important to note that as proposed in a recent work  @xcite , a reanalysis of the @xmath13 decay is very important . in the @xmath14 invariant mass distribution of this decay process",
    ", an enhancement followed by a dip can be seen  @xcite . a careful study of this decay showed that the structure is consistent with the existence of the @xmath5 , which couples to @xmath7 and coupled channels in @xmath15-wave  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the possibility that the peak seen in ref .",
    "@xcite could correspond to the @xmath5 was already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the possibility that it would correspond to a resonance was not mentioned in the original experimental paper  @xcite probably because of the relatively low statistics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental structure close to 4450 mev was reasonably described .",
    "the peak and dip structure was explained as the interference between @xmath15-wave @xmath14 ( and coupled channels ) and @xmath7 interactions .",
    "if this is confirmed by the ongoing lhcb analysis , it will give further support to the nature of the @xmath5 proposed in refs .",

    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , we assume that the @xmath37 quark pair of the original @xmath35 goes into the final baryon upon hadronization of the three quarks produced in the first stage .",
    "other possibilities involve transfer of one of these quarks to the final mesons and a large momentum transfer that strongly suppresses such mechanisms  @xcite .    in order to get a meson - baryon pair from the final three quarks of @xmath44",
    "we must proceed with hadronization creating a @xmath45 pair with the quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "this process must involve the  upper \" @xmath38-quark in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] because the @xmath23 system will be in s - wave in the final state and will have negative parity .",
