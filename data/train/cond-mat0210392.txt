    "it is getting realized that the successful control of spin - polarized electrical currents would give rise to essential impact in information technology , thereby resulting in that the spin - dependent tunneling in hybrid systems of ferromagnetic and normal metals ( insulators ) has attracted much attention during the past years ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite for review ) . a nascent field",
    "dubbed as _ spintronics , _ is therefore emerging . among others ,",
    "a large number of studies on the electrical transport properties in metallic magnetic multilayers show the existence of the effect of a so - called giant magnetoresistance ( gmr)@xcite , which is now believed to be caused by spin - dependent scattering in the systems . since its potential applications , the gmr effect has been actively studied both theoretically and experimentally in recent years ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "apart from the gmr found in metallic magnetic multilayers , the spin - valve effect is observed in ferromagnetic ( fm ) tunneling junctions . following the discovery of spin - polarized tunneling of conduction electrons in ferromagnets by tedrow and meservey@xcite ,",
    "jullire was the first to observe the effect that the tunneling resistance in an f - i - f junction consisting of two fm electrodes separated by an insulating ( i ) barrier depends strongly on the relative orientations of magnetizations , namely the resistance is low when magnetizations in fm electrodes are parallel , and the resistance is high when magnetizations in fm electrodes are antiparallel , and a two - current model was proposed to interpret the observed large junction magnetoresistance in fe - ge - co junctions at @xmath2 @xmath3 by assuming the spin conservation so that the tunneling of spin up and spin down electrons undergoes two independent processes@xcite .",
    "the tunneling magnetoresistance has also been observed by maekawa and gfvert@xcite .",
    "treating the f - i - f junction as a single quantum - mechanical system , slonczewski adopted a free - electron model to describe the tunneling of spin - polarized conduction electrons , and recovered the spin - valve effect@xcite .",
    "the extension of slonczewski s model to a realistic band structure based on a tight - binding model was established@xcite .",
    "recently , on the basis of scattering matrix theory the spin - dependent electrical and thermal transport in f - i - f junctions was developed at finite bias voltage and at finite temperatures@xcite .",
    "it is found that not only the electrical conductance but also the thermal conductance reveals the spin - valve effect at low temperatures .",
    "there are also some theories devoted to f - i - f tunneling junctions ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "moreover , the spin - valve effect can also appear in ferromagnet - normal metal - ferromagnet ( f - n - f ) junctions which may have different transport properties from the f - i - f junctions .",
    "johnson was the first to predict the phenomenon of spin accumulation in f - n - f junctions , which was soon confirmed in a three - terminal device , and a transistor effect was observed in such a device@xcite .",
    "valet and fert studied the f - n - f structure and applied the boltzmann equation to the current perpendicular to the plane structure by assuming that the thickness of nonmagnetic metallic layer is much shorter than the spin - diffusion length .",
    "the theory can reduce to johnson s theory as the thickness of nonmagnetic metal is much longer than the spin - diffusion length@xcite .",
    "by taking into account different magnetizations of ferromagnetic reservoirs and spin diffusion in the normal metal , hernando et al studied the equation for the diffusive spin transport in the f - n - f structure and showed that the difference between the conductance of the parallel and antiparallel configuration can be either positive or negative as a function of the applied magnetic field@xcite .",
    "zheng et al have investigated a double tunnel junction model describing the f - i - n - i - f structure by means of quantum mechanical approach , and the oscillation of the tunneling conductance and the tmr on the spacer s thickness is found@xcite . a finite - element method@xcite and nonequilibrium",
    "green function method@xcite has also been applied to the mesoscopic junction systems",
    ".    within the theories above mentioned , the effect of impurities was not much investigated .",
    "although it is argued that the impurities and defects may lead to the resonant tunneling in f - i - f junctions@xcite , the study on the effect of impurities on the spin - dependent transport in f - n - f junctions is still sparse .",
    "another important factor , which is usually ignored in theories , is the effect of the effective masses of electrons in fm and normal layers . as in realistic hybrid junctions",
    "the electrodes are made by different ferromagnets , such as half - metals @xcite and magnetic semiconductors@xcite , the effective mass would have significant effect on the transport properties . in this paper , by treating the f - n - f junction as a quantum - mechanical system we shall investigate the effect of nonmagnetic impurities as well as the effective masses of electrons in fm and normal layers on the spin - dependent electrical transport properties in spin - valve systems .",
    "it is found that the impurity and the effective mass can both lead to nonmonotonous oscillation of @xmath1 with the incident energy and the thickness of the normal metal .",
    "the effective mass can enlarge the @xmath1 effect when the difference between the two fm layers is small .",
    "on the other hand , if the difference is large , the @xmath1 effect becomes smaller and the inverse @xmath1 effect would appear .",
    "the rest of this paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the model which we shall adopt in the subsequent sections will be described and some relevant formalism will be derived . sec .",
    "iii will present the effect of nonmagnetic impurities on the junction magnetoresistance in f - n - f junctions , and the effect of effective masses of electrons in fm electrodes will be given in sec .",

    ", one may investigate the effect of nonmagnetic impurities and the effective masses of conduction electrons on the conductance in f - n - f junctions .",
    "to investigate the effect of nonmagnetic impurities on the conductance of f - n - f junctions , we have to make proper assumptions .",
    "first , we take @xmath72 , and suppose the two fm electrodes the same , i.e. @xmath73 . then , without loss of generality the coefficients of @xmath74-like impurity potentials at the interfaces are taken as @xmath75 .",
    "we have found that @xmath76 does not alter qualitatively the behaviors observed .",
    "the fermi energy of the normal metal layer is assumed to be the same as in fm electrodes .",
    "we find that the conductance depends strongly on the relative orientation of magnetizations of fm electrodes , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is observed that for given @xmath4 ( the thickness of the normal metal layer ) and @xmath77 ( the amplitude of the impurity potential ) , the conductance is the largest at @xmath78 , while at @xmath79 the conductance reaches the smallest , resurging the spin - valve effect .",
    "however , one may note that the conductance is not zero as @xmath79 , indicating the spin - valve effect is imperfect .",
    "this is because in the two - band model the spins in the left fm electrode are not perfectly polarized , there is a portion of electrons with spin down at the fermi level available , leading to a small current flowing through the junction even if the magnetizations in two fm electrodes are antiparallel , a result quite close to the realistic situation . with increasing @xmath21 to @xmath80 the conductance",
    "@xmath81 is monotonically decreasing , while @xmath82 is monotonically increasing . in experiments ,",
    "people are usually interested in the quantity @xmath83 .",
    "without particular specification the @xmath1 refers to @xmath84 hereafter .",
    "the effect of impurity on the conductance is shown in fig.3 for @xmath85 for an example .",
    "one may see that at a given fermi energy ( e.g. @xmath86 ) with increasing @xmath77 the conductance @xmath87 is first decreasing to a minimum , then increasing to a maximum , and then decreasing to zero .",
    "when the energy barrier produced by impurities is high enough , the conductance tends to zero , which is quite reasonable in physics , because in this situation the electrons can not overcome the impurity - barrier to tunnel through the junction .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath87 has a maximum at a certain value of @xmath77 , suggesting that the resonant tunneling occurs in this case .",
    "this could be viewed as a kind of the impurity - induced resonant tunneling . as the impurity potentials in our model",
    "are simulated by the double-@xmath22 potential barriers , in the region of normal metal layer there might be some quasi - bound states under certain conditions .",
    "the appearance of the quasi - bound states is a consequence arised from both the double-@xmath22 potential barriers at two interfaces and the quantum size effect of the middle metal film .",
    "when the incident energy of electrons matches approximately the level of the quasi - bound states , the resonant tunneling occurs , manifested by the occurrence of the peak of the conductance versus @xmath77 . for other values of @xmath66 , the conductance has the similar behaviors , in spite of positions of maxima being different . from fig .",
    "3 , one may observe that the conductance is oscillating with the fermi energy .",
    "we also study the @xmath1 versus @xmath77 , as shown in fig.4 .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath1 is nonmonotonous increasing with @xmath77 . at low @xmath66",
    "( e.g. @xmath88 ) the @xmath1 shows one peak , and with increasing @xmath66 ( e.g. @xmath89 ) the @xmath1 has two peaks . when @xmath66 takes a larger value ( e.g. @xmath90 ) only one peak of the @xmath1 is left , which is a consequence of the conductance oscillating with the fermi energy , leading to that the resonant positions of the @xmath1 depends strongly on the magnitudes of fermi energies . at larger @xmath77 ,",
    "the @xmath1 saturates to a constant .",
    "furthermore , one may observe that the @xmath1 is negative for some low @xmath77 and low @xmath66 .",
    "this is not difficult to understand by noting the fact that the spin - up and spin - down electrons in region 1 have the same incident energies but with different wave vectors , and the transmissivity @xmath91 is oscillatory increasing with increasing @xmath66 . at some regimes of low @xmath92 and @xmath66",
    ", it is found that @xmath93 but @xmath94 , while the absolute value of the latter is greater than the former , resulting in that the conductance @xmath87 of parallel alignment of magnetizations is smaller than that of antiparallel alignment at some low @xmath66 and @xmath77 , which finally gives rise to the negative @xmath1 .",
    "this is actually a result of the two - band model .",
    "the @xmath1 is oscillating with the fermi energy , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "when @xmath95 , the @xmath1 is symmetrically oscillating with respect to zero axis .",
    "this can be readily understood by taking the two - band feature into account . with increasing @xmath77 ,",
    "the @xmath1 becomes asymmetrically oscillating with more oscillating peaks .",
    "such behaviors are closely related to the quasi - bound states induced by impurity barriers .",
    "if @xmath96 is very large , the spin - dependent effect will be smaller , leading to the @xmath1 approaching to zero with increasing @xmath96 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath1 on the thickness of the normal metal layer is depicted in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath1 is oscillating with the thickness @xmath4 . in absence of the impurity potential",
    ", the @xmath1 is symmetrically oscillating with increasing the thickness with one oscillation period .",
    "this phenomenon can be of quantum origin , and more specifically , of the quantum - size effect , which has been noted before for the gmr in a one - band model@xcite and in double tunnel junction structure@xcite . with increasing @xmath77 ,",
    "the oscillation period becomes two , which is closely related to the impurity - induced resonant tunneling or the quasi - bound states .",
    "it is interesting to note that the positive and negative @xmath1 effect was also found in the giant magnetoresistance of f - n - f system @xcite , as well as in n / f / i / f / n structure@xcite .",
    "now we turn to consider the case that the electrons in the three layers have different effective masses .",
    "the solutions of schrdinger equation have the same forms as eqs .",

    "we shall assume the same values of parameters ( except for @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) as those in sec .",
    "iii . in this case , the wavevectors are different for different effective masses .    the @xmath77- and @xmath66-dependences of the conductance @xmath87 for different effective masses are plotted in figs . 7 ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , respectively , where we have taken @xmath111 as a scale for effective masses .",
    "it is seen that compared with fig .",
    "3 the effect of the effective masses on the conductance versus @xmath77 and @xmath66 is quite dramatic . from fig .",
    "7(a ) one may observe that for a given @xmath112 the conductance @xmath87 versus @xmath77 is monotonous decreasing for smaller @xmath113 but shows resonant peaks for larger @xmath113 , namely , when the ratio @xmath114 is larger , the conductance versus @xmath77 shows no resonant peaks , implying that the effect of the effective masses smears out the impurity - induced resonant tunneling , while @xmath115 is near unity , the sharp peak appears in the curve of @xmath87 _",
    "vs_. @xmath77 , and the impurity - induced tunneling recovers .",
    "this observation might be related to the quasi - bound states induced by impurities .",
    "the conductance @xmath87 versus the fermi energy is oscillating , but the behavior is quite different for different effective masses , as shown in fig .",
    "there are two notable characters about @xmath87 varying with the fermi energy , namely , the oscillating amplitudes of @xmath87 for @xmath116 are always larger than those for @xmath117 , and the conductance is increasingly oscillating with increasing the fermi energy .    in order to figure out the effect of the effective masses on the @xmath1 , we plot the @xmath1 versus @xmath113 for different @xmath112 s , as shown in fig . 8 , where we have taken @xmath95 for simplicity .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath1 exhibits maxima when the condition @xmath118 is satisfied , which is clearly illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "8 , where the contour plot for the maximum @xmath1 in the @xmath112-@xmath119 plane is presented .",
    "away from this condition , the jmr is sharply increasing for smaller @xmath113 and decreasing for larger @xmath119 .",
    "this result shows that to get larger @xmath1 one may do the best to choose those ferromagnetic metals with almost the same effective masses of electrons to fabricate the two fm electrodes in a spin - valve .",
    "the smaller the difference of the effective masses in the two fm electrodes has , the larger the @xmath1 is .",
    "we have also studied the thickness of the normal metal dependence of the @xmath120 for different @xmath112 and @xmath113 , as depicted in fig .",
    "9 , where we have taken @xmath95 . in comparison to fig",
    ". 6 , one may find that different effective masses would lead to different oscillating behaviors of the @xmath1 . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "9 where @xmath121 , with increasing @xmath113 the periodic oscillations of the @xmath1 with @xmath122 becomes quite different , and when @xmath123 the @xmath1 becomes negative . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "9 where @xmath124 , one may find that except @xmath125 the oscillation amplitudes are much suppressed as the ratio @xmath115 is much larger or smaller than one . in this case",
    "the @xmath1 is negative when @xmath119 is smaller . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "9 where @xmath126 , the situation is just opposite to the case in the upper panel , namely , with increasing @xmath113 the oscillating @xmath1 becomes positive from negative .",
    "it appears that the sign of the @xmath1 is primarily controlled by @xmath127 .",
    "as mentioned above , the cause for the oscillation of the @xmath120 with the thickness of the normal metal layer stems from the quantum - size effect , while the oscillation period and amplitude are remarkably affected by the effective masses of electrons , i.e. @xmath128 and @xmath129 .    to get the knowledge of the resultant effect of both impurity and effective masses on the @xmath1 , we present the results shown in figs .",
    "it is observed that for a given @xmath130 the @xmath1 is increasing to a maximum due to the impurity - induced tunneling , then decreasing to a minimum , and then increasing to saturate with increasing @xmath77 , and those maxima and minima are decreasing with increasing @xmath113 , as shown in fig .",

    ", the proper ratio @xmath134 should be carefully chosen .",
    "based on a two - band model in this paper , we have investigated the effects of nonmagnetic impurities and effective masses of electrons in fm and normal metallic layers on the spin - dependent transport in a f - n - f hybrid structure by treating the system as a quantum - mechanical system .",
    "it is observed that both impurities and effective masses have remarkable effects on the conductance and the @xmath1 as well .",
    "the spin - valve effect , though imperfect due to the two - band feature , is recovered for low impurity barriers , while it becomes less obvious for high barriers .",
    "the so - called impurity - induced resonant tunneling is clearly seen in the f - n - f system .",
    "the reason for this property is that the quasi - bound states induced by impurities are formed in this system , and if the incident energy meets with the quasi - bound energy , the resonant tunneling occurs , leading to peaks observed in the curve of the conductance versus the amplitude of the impurity potential .",
    "it is found that the @xmath1 is oscillating with the amplitude of the impurity potential , the incident energies of electrons , as well as the thickness of the normal metallic layer .",
    "the impurity is also observed to influence remarkably the oscillating amplitudes and periods of the @xmath1 .",
    "the effective masses of electrons in the three layers were found to have significant effects on the conductance and the @xmath1 .",
    "it is demonstrated that the difference between the effective masses would tend to suppress the amplitudes of the conductance , namely , the larger the difference , the smaller the amplitude of the conductance . in other words ,",
    "a smaller difference of the effective masses in the two fm electrodes would give rise to a larger amplitude of the @xmath1 , suggesting that to get larger @xmath1 one ought ot choose those fm materials with almost identical effective masses of electrons .",
    "we have also found that the effective masses affect considerably the oscillating periods , amplitudes , as well as the positions of resonant peaks of the @xmath1 .",
    "recently magnetic semiconductors are used to be the injector of electrons in both resonant tunneling diodes@xcite and light - emitting diodes@xcite .",
    "magnetic semiconductor has both properties of semiconductor and ferromagnet , and in these systems the effective mass of conduction electrons would have considerable effect on the transport properties .",
    "therefore , our above discussion would be meaningful , and the reported results could be examined experimentally . here",
    "we would like to point out that although we do not incorporate factors like spin - flip scatterings from magnons and magnetic impurities , as well as the spin accumulation , our obtained results are expected to shed some useful light on the spin - dependent transport in f - n - f hybrid junctions .",

    "<S> the effect of nonmagnetic impurities and the effective masses on the spin - dependent transport in a ferromagnet - normal metal - ferromagnet junction is investigated on the basis of a two - band model . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that impurities and the effective masses of electrons in two ferromagnetic electrodes have remarkable effects on the behaviors of the conductance , namely , both affect the oscillating amplitudes , periods , as well as the positions of the resonant peaks of the conductance considerably . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity tends to suppress the amplitudes of the conductance , and makes the spin - valve effect less obvious , but under certain conditions the phenomenon of the so - called impurity - induced resonant tunneling is clearly observed . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity and the effective mass both can lead to nonmonotonous oscillation of the junction magnetoresistance ( @xmath0 with the incident energy and the thickness of the normal metal . </S>",
    "<S> it is also observed that a smaller difference of the effective masses of electrons in two ferromagnetic electrodes would give rise to a larger amplitude of the @xmath1 . </S>"
