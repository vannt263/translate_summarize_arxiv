    "<S> [ fig : es ] , the lowest entanglement energy is found at @xmath116 with @xmath117 , which can be identified with the `` gs '' of virtual edge modes probed by the rses . `` excited states '' in the rses are found in both positive and negative directions of @xmath98 relative to the `` gs '' , which indicates the counter - propagating nature of the edge modes . this is in sharp contrast to the case of a single chiral edge mode @xcite , where low - lying `` excited states '' are found only in one direction of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the excitations along the left envelope of the spectrum can be interpreted as the left - moving spin mode with @xmath118 , as spin excitations with @xmath119 and @xmath120 relative to the `` gs '' are found there ; the shifts @xmath121 and @xmath122 of these excitations are consistent with eqs .   and . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the excitations along the right envelope can be interpreted as the right - moving charge mode with @xmath123 , as charge excitations with @xmath124 and @xmath125 are found there . </S>",

    "<S> the rses of the @xmath63 state reveals a counter - propagating nature of edge modes @xcite , as in the @xmath57 case in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : es ] . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the @xmath63 state has certain similarities with the @xmath57 iqh state . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bosonic iqh states with @xmath127 predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are _ not _ good candidates for the present system , as their corresponding simplest @xmath100 matrices are not symmetric with respect to the interchange of the two components . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed characterization of the states at @xmath126 is left for future studies .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss possible experiments for observing the iqh state found in this letter . in ultracold atom experiments , a clear signature of a quantum hall state would be a density plateau in an _ in situ _ image of a gas . </S>",
    "<S> a challenge here is how to realize a large synthetic field required for observing this state . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , by using an optical coupling between @xmath128 internal states of @xmath129rb atoms with space - dependent detuning , a flux density @xmath130m@xmath131 has been realized . </S>",
    "<S> this produces the landau - level spacing @xmath132 nk@xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> it is an important technical challenge to increase this field by a factor of a few tens so that @xmath134 dominates the experimental temperature scales . </S>",
    "<S> this could be achieved by further increasing the detuning gradient in the scheme of ref .   or by using spatially shifted laser beams @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that the appearance of exotic phases demonstrated in this letter and refs .   and stimulate experimental attempts to create such large synthetic magnetic field in two - component bose gases , by , for example , separately creating synthetic fields in the @xmath128 and @xmath9 states of @xmath129rb . </S>",
    "<S> once such a large field is created , a quantum hall regime with @xmath135 is expected to be realized by splitting the gas into an array of 2d systems by using a one - dimensional optical lattice along the @xmath27 direction as suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . by strongly squeezing each 2d system along the @xmath27 direction , </S>",
    "<S> the iqh state exhibits a reasonable gap for its observation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added . </S>",
    "<S> _ after the submission of this letter , we became aware of two independent works @xcite , which also study the ground state at @xmath57 and have some overlap with this letter @xcite .    </S>",
