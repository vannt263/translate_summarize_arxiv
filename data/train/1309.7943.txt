    "much of the recent work regarding the emerging topic of nonlinear phenomena in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has revolved around the theme of vortices .",
    "the latter constitute the prototypical two - dimensional ( or quasi - two - dimensional ) excitation that arises in becs and bears a topological charge .",
    "the volume of work on becs focusing on the theme of vortices can be well appreciated from the existence of many reviews on the subject  @xcite .",
    "part of the fascination with vortices bears its roots in the significant connections of this field with other areas of physics , including hydrodynamics  @xcite , superfluids  @xcite , and nonlinear optics  @xcite .",
    "while vortices  @xcite and even robust lattices thereof @xcite were observed shortly after the experimental realization of becs , recent years have shown a considerable increase in the interest in vortex dynamics .",
    "this is in good measure due to the activity of many experimental groups . among them , we highlight the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite enabling the formation of vortices through the so - called kibble - zurek mechanism  @xcite ; the latter was originally proposed for the formation of large scale structure in the universe , by means of a quench through a phase transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quench through the phase transition led to the bec formation and hence to the spontaneous trapping of phase gradients and emergence of vortex excitations . in many of these experiments ,",
    "not only single vortices , but also vortex dipoles were observed .",
    "this is where another remarkable contribution came to play  @xcite . by pumping a small fraction of the atoms to a different ( unconfined by the magnetic trap ) hyperfine state",
    ", it is possible to extract atoms ( e.g.  @xmath0% of the bec ) and image them , enabling for the first time ( in bec ) a minimally destructive unveiling of the true vortex dynamics _ as it happens_. this work and the follow - up efforts of ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as yet another remarkable experiment  @xcite revealed the key dynamical relevance of multi - vortex clusters in the form of _ vortex dipoles _ ( vds ) . in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the superfluid analogue of flow past a cylinder was realized , leading to the spontaneous emergence of such vds . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the full ( integrable at the level of two vortices ) dynamics of the vd case was revealed .",
    "the theme of few - vortex crystals has garnered interest in the case of higher number - of - vortices variants in the works of ref .",
    "@xcite ( 3 vortices ) and in the very recent co - rotating ( same charge ) vortex case of ref .",
    "@xcite ( 3 as well as 4 same charge vortices ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "another topic of increasing attention has concerned the role of finite - temperature induced damping of the bec @xcite that , in turn , leads to anti - damping in the motion of the coherent structures therein .",
    "in particular , the simpler case of dark solitons in single - component becs has been studied at some length @xcite . in this context , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) provided originally a kinetic - equation along with a study of the bogolyubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "there , it was argued that the dark soliton obeys an anti - damped harmonic oscillator equation , resulting into trajectories of growing oscillating amplitudes around the center of the trap confining the bec : the first experiments  @xcite observed the motion of a dark soliton created by phase imprinting at the center of the trap towards the edge of the trap  @xcite ; one / more full soliton oscillations were subsequently demonstrated in two distinct experiments  @xcite ( see also related theoretical work of refs .",
    "more recently , the effect of anti - damping was actually directly observed for the first time  @xcite in the related context of dark soliton oscillations in the unitary fermi gas .",
    "anti - damped dynamical equations for dark solitons ( in the context of bosons ) were derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of a hamiltonian perturbation approach  @xcite applied to the dissipative variant of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( dgpe ) .",
    "the dgpe was originally introduced phenomenologically by pitaevskii  @xcite as a simplified means of accounting ( through a damping term ) for the role of finite temperature induced fluctuations in the condensate dynamics ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the microscopic interpretation of such a term .",
    "it should be noted here that , at least in the dark soliton context , the dgpe model was found @xcite to yield predictions that compared favorably with more complex stochastic gross - pitaevskii equation ( sgpe )  @xcite _ when comparing to appropriately averaged quantities with the same dissipation parameter _ ; for this reason , we adopt the dgpe in what follows .",
    "the dgpe has been employed in more complex settings involving multiple dark solitons  @xcite and dark - bright solitons in multiple component becs  @xcite , yet it has arguably received somewhat less attention in higher dimensions , and especially so in the case of single- and multiple vortex states .",
    "the dynamics of vortices under the influence of thermal effects , has been considered in some computational detail recently  @xcite , and a semi - classical limit case in the absence of a trap has been of mathematical interest as well  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the role of quantum effects , mostly relevant at extremely low temperatures , as well as atom numbers , where they dominate over thermal effects ) . while the case of a single trapped vortex has been considered in the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a comparison of numerical computations to analytical results , and more importantly , its generalization to multi - vortex settings is still an open problem ; it is the aim of the present work to contribute towards this direction .",
    "we start by developing in sec .",
    "ii an energy - based method that provides a dynamical equation characterizing the single vortex dynamics , with our results also supplemented by another technique ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ appa ] ) based on methods similar to the ones of refs .",
    "we believe that our method provides a useful alternative to the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite ( the relevant connections are discussed herein ) . the main focus of this paper ( sec .",
    "iii ) is to generalize this to the experimentally relevant case of a vortex dipole , using the relevant set of first - order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "the resulting odes are then compared to the full dgpe model .",
    "we also perform a linear stability analysis in the absence / presence of the phenomenological damping , and characterize the internal modes of the single and dipole vortex systems ( cf .  appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "our results for the single vortex and vortex dipole stability and dynamics reveal the following : already in the regime of small but experimentally - relevant chemical potentials , where the vortices can be well approximated as particles fully characterized by their position , the model provides a qualitatively accurate and semi - quantitative approximation of the relevant stability and dynamical properties of the original equation ( dgpe ) for typical low temperature bec experiments .",
    "we summarize and discuss the broader context of our results in sec .  iv .",
    "the dissipative gpe model can be expressed in the following dimensionless form for a pancake shaped bec ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the reductions that lead to such a quasi - two - dimensional description ) @xmath1 here , @xmath2 represents the quasi - two - dimensional bec wavefunction , @xmath3 represents the laplacian operator , @xmath4 is the external harmonic trap ( @xmath5 is the normalized trap frequency , while @xmath6 ) , and @xmath7 stands for the chemical potential . the latter is directly related to the number of atoms in the bec , with the limit of large @xmath7 being suitable for a particle - based description of coherent structures ( in a semi - classical fashion ; see e.g. , ref .",
    "finally , the dimensionless parameter @xmath8 is associated with the system s temperature , based on the earlier treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite see also refs .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "physically relevant cases correspond to @xmath9 @xcite , as also discussed in the specific applications of refs .",
    "@xcite . in the case of a single vortex ,",
    "the stationary state is well - known to exist at the center of the parabolic trap ; in the hamiltonian case of @xmath10 , upon displacement from the trap center , the vortex executes a circular precession around it  @xcite which has been also very accurately quantified experimentally  @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath11 , the anomalous ( internal ) mode of the vortex associated with the precessional motion becomes _",
    "unstable_. this anomalous mode , as explained , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , is associated with the fact that the vortex does not represent the ground state of the system .",
    "nevertheless , it is a dynamically _ stable _ entity in the absence of a dissipative channel , as it can not shed energy away to spontaneously turn into the ground state . yet , as was rigorously proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of any dissipation typically renders such anomalous modes ( so - called negative krein sign modes ) _ immediately _ unstable , as it provides a channel enabling the expulsion of the coherent structure and the conversion of the system into its corresponding ground state .",
    "this is evident from the presence of a positive imaginary part of the eigenfrequency ( i.e. , a real part of the corresponding eigenvalue ) , which directly signals the relevant instability for any non - zero value of @xmath8 .",
    "this is discussed further in appendix  [ appb ] , which also shows how the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( @xmath10 ) case gets modified by @xmath8 .    motivated by the above discussion ( and corresponding numerical results in appendix  [ appb ] ) ,",
    "we now develop a systematic approach based on the time evolution of the vortex energy for accounting the effect of the anti - damping term proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , we will seek to identify the equations of motion for the center of a single vortex @xmath12 as a first step towards investigating the vortex dipole case .    in the case of @xmath10 , the energy of the system [ i.e.",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     initially , we consider the case of a _ symmetric _ vortex dipole ( fig .  [ density_dynamics_vortex_dipole_epicycle_no_dissipation_mu_160 ]",

    "[ density_dynamics_single_vortex_no_dissipation_mu_160 ] ) , where excellent agreement has already been reported ; here , we effectively excite the epicyclic precession mode of the vortex dipole .",
    "we find that for the relatively small chemical potentials @xmath33 considered here , there is a small noticeable deviation even for @xmath10 ; this is presumably due to the neglect of vortex - sound interactions in the analytical model .",
    "we note that in the case of finite @xmath8 , the epicyclic trajectory will continue to expand outward until the vortices essentially merge with the vanishing background of the cloud and disappear thereafter ; here , the corresponding analytical anti - damped pattern ( @xmath11 ) consistently predicts a slightly lower amplitude of oscillations , with the discrepancy increasing with increasing @xmath8 ( at constant small value of @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , a slight increase in the value of @xmath7 can considerably suppress such differences ( see subsequent fig .",

    "we have chosen to show here a highly asymmetric initial vd configuration , which nonetheless yields reasonable qualitative agreement .",

    "it is important to note that in this case , involving dynamics of the vortices fairly close to the thomas - fermi radius , we have generally found ( in dynamical evolutions not shown herein ) that our theoretical analysis and particle model are least likely to properly capture the vortex dynamics .",
    "this is because in this case the condensate s density modulation in fact affects most significantly both of the dynamical elements contained in our model , namely the precession and the inter - vortex interaction . as regards the precession , we have found that eq .",
    "( [ fett_eq ] ) is progressively less accurate for distances approximately satisfying @xmath34 . at the same time",

    "[ density_dynamics_vortex_dipole_epicycle_no_dissipation_mu_160 ] ( right column ) we may expect a rough qualitative agreement between the numerical observations and our simple ode model , but a quantitative match would require a considerably more complex particle model accounting for the above traits , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we note that this trend seen in the dependence of the vd motion is in qualitative agreement with previous findings in the related case of two interacting dark solitons in a single harmonic trap .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite , highlighted the increased role of soliton - sound interactions for two solitons located in _",
    "positions in a one - dimensional harmonic trap , which allowed significant energy exchange .    in the spirit of exploring the relevance of the model to other parametric regimes ,",
    "we have also attempted to probe similar features , as e.g.  in fig .",
    "[ density_dynamics_vortex_dipole_epicycle_no_dissipation_mu_160 ] , for different sets of parameter values .",
    "our conclusion from this study is that for larger values of the chemical potential and smaller values of the trap frequency @xmath5 , the model becomes generally and progressively more accurate .",
    "this is confirmed not only by the eigenvalue computations and more accurate linearization predictions ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) , but also by direct numerical computations of the vortex dynamics as , e.g. , in the dipole epicyclic evolution of fig .",
    "[ mu_4_omega_01_gamma_0_epicycle_b_2_adjusted2 ] .",
    "the figure shows two epicyclic evolution examples for the cases of @xmath10 ( left ) and @xmath35 ( right ) , while reducing @xmath5 to @xmath36 and increasing the chemical potential @xmath7 to @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "both the fully three - dimensional evolution of @xmath38 as a function of @xmath39 and the cross sections in the @xmath38 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 planes reveal a very accurate capturing of the motion of the vortices .",
    "nevertheless , we should note here that even slight `` detunings '' from the exact vortex motion ( e.g. due to the imperfect capturing of the screening effect ) lead to a cumulative effect over the long integration times displayed e.g. in fig .",

    "the single vortices were confirmed ( in accordance with earlier reported works ) both analytically and numerically to spiral outwards towards the rim of the condensate , disappearing in the corresponding background .",
    "while this dgpe model is only valid far from the critical temperature due to the result of ignoring fluctuations , this is nonetheless a relevant regime for numerous experiments given the excellent experimental control currently available .",
    "starting from such a model ( and ignoring stochastic fluctuations which are expected to become significant at higher temperatures and closer to the critical region as discussed , e.g. , in refs .",

    ", one can consider more complex two - dimensional settings including larger vortex clusters , and co - rotating vortex patterns ( see recent experimental and theoretical results in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , instead of purely counter - rotating ones , such as the dipoles considered herein .",
    "an additional direction that could be very relevant to explore , particularly in the case of asymmetric vortex dipoles , concerns the interplay of vortices with sound waves as the sound emitted from each of the vortices could be affecting the motion of the other vortex within the pair , in a way reminiscent of the recent analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a very natural extension would be to attempt to provide effective equations for a single vortex ring in the context of a three - dimensional space - time generalization of the dissipation considered herein .",
    "such vortex rings may appear even spontaneously in three - dimensional space - time becs  @xcite and even their interactions have been experimentally monitored  @xcite ( see also the relevant review of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , hence the development of a particle based formulation for their motion seems like a particularly exciting topic for future study .",
    "we start by considering the pde of the form of eq . .",

    "@xmath61 is a ball of radius @xmath53 around the center position @xmath62 of the vortex and @xmath63 denotes the boundary of such a region .",

    "next , turning to numerical computations based on our analytical approximations , we now examine the linearization ( bdg ) analysis around a single vortex ( fig .",

    "@xcite , there is a pair of internal modes of the two - vortex bound state .",
    "one of these is a goldstone mode of vanishing frequency associated with the free rotation of the pair around the trap center .",

    "<S> in this paper , we examine the dynamical properties of vortices in atomic bose - einstein condensates in the presence of phenomenological dissipation , used as a basic model for the effect of finite temperatures . in the context of this so - called dissipative gross - pitaevskii model , </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytical results for the motion of single vortices and , importantly , for vortex dipoles which have become very relevant experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results are shown to compare favorably to the full numerical solution of the dissipative gross - pitaevskii equation in parameter regimes of experimental relevance . </S>",
    "<S> we also present results on the stability of vortices and vortex dipoles , revealing good agreement between numerical and analytical results for the internal excitation eigenfrequencies , which extends even beyond the regime of validity of this equation for cold atoms . </S>"
