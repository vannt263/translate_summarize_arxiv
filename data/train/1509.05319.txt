    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) plays a critical role in the star formation and chemical evolution of galaxies . yet",
    "a full understanding remains elusive , with it being seen only in part or under special conditions .",
    "this is true in particular for the molecular component , as molecular hydrogen is virtually invisible , challenging our ability to investigate how and when atomic gas becomes molecular . even though the exact nature of their presumed molecular carriers is unknown . ] , the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) they generally cause in the spectra of stars are a powerful probe of the molecular ism and the atomic  molecular interfaces .",
    "the magellanic clouds are two nearby ( @xmath2 and 50 kpc for the smc and lmc , respectively ) interacting , gas - rich dwarf galaxies with sub - solar ism metallicities ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 z@xmath5 for the smc and lmc , respectively ) .",
    "the recession velocities ( @xmath6 km s@xmath1 for the smc and 250300 km s@xmath1 for the lmc ) result in doppler shifts with respect to absorption in the milky way of @xmath7   in the smc and @xmath8   in the lmc at visible wavelengths . while some dibs are broader than this , many are narrow enough to separate the magellanic from the foreground galactic absorption ( jenniskens & dsert 1994 ) .",
    "this is the case particularly for the 5780 and 5797   dibs , which are intrinsically strong and their ratio is a clear diagnostic of exposure to uv irradiation and/or high electron density .",
    "hutchings ( 1966 ) was the first to report a dib in the magellanic clouds , viz.the broad 4430   band .",
    "subsequent detections and upper limits were obtained by blades & madore ( 1979 ) and houziaux , nandy & morgan ( 1980 , 1985 ) .",
    "ehrenfreund et al .  (",
    "2002 ) first detected the 5780 and 5797   dibs in the smc . while the uv radiation field seems to be the dominant factor affecting the relative strengths of dibs in the magellanic clouds ( cox et al .",
    "2006 ) , other local conditions matter too ( welty et al .",
    "2006 ) , with cox et al.(2007 ) highlighting metallicity effects both through reduced shielding against uv light and possibly directly through elemental depletions .",
    "following pioneering efforts by van loon et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to map dibs across the sky , van loon et al .",
    "( 2013 ) presented such maps towards the tarantula nebula in the lmc , showing a clear relation of dibs with the diffuse ism and with the radiation field .    here",
    "we present high signal - to - noise spectra from a dedicated campaign to map the 5780 and 5797   dibs and the caiik and naid lines across most of the smc and a large part of the lmc .",
    "these are the first maps of this kind , revealing how the dib carriers relate to the neutral and weakly ionized gas , the diffuse and star - forming ism , and uv - shielded and irradiated conditions in these metal - poor environments . at the same time , we also map the galactic foreground absorption , revealing small - scale structure in all these tracers , as well as caiik absorption arising in intermediate- and high - velocity clouds which are probably located in the galactic halo .",
    "the observations were carried out with the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) at siding spring , australia , during 36 november 2011 ( programmes atac/10b/51 and aat/11b/17 ; pi : j.th .",
    "van loon ) .",
    "the two - degree field ( 2df ) 400-fibre positioning system was used in conjunction with the aa@xmath9 spectrograph mounted at the coud focus , benefitting from a wide - field corrector and an atmospheric dispersion compensator .",
    "the spectrograph has a dichroic beam - splitter allowing simultaneous observation of a `` blue '' and a `` red '' spectrum created with volume phase holographic ( vph ) reflection gratings .",
    "each spectrum was sampled with an e2v ccd with 2k pixels along the spectral and 4k pixels along the spatial direction .",
    "we used the 3200b and 2000r gratings with the 570-nm dichroic , with the central wavelength set to 3935   for the blue arm and 5840   for the red arm .",
    "this yielded a spectral resolving power of @xmath10 ( 38 km s@xmath1 ) , covering wavelength ranges of 37794084   in the central fibre and 37514054   in the end fibres in the blue , and 55696101   in the central fibre and 55286056   in the end fibres in the red .",
    "the smc field was observed in the first half of the night and the lmc field in the second .",
    "the weather conditions deteriorated throughout the observing run , with seeing from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and increasing levels of cloud cover .",
    "eventually , the smc and lmc fields received total integration times of 12.5 hr and 13 hr , respectively , all split into individual 30-minute integrations .    before and after each night the following calibration measurements were performed : bias ( electronic offset ) , dark current level , arc lamp exposures for wavelength calibration , and flat field observations on the sky and dome  the latter employing 20-w lamps for the red and 75-w lamps for the blue .",
    "the targets , fiducial stars ( for acquisition ) and sky positions are shown in figure 1 ; they were selected from the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( zaritsky et al .",
    "while the best targets for the study of interstellar absorption are early - type stars , which are bright and have relatively few and weak spectral features , their colours may have been reddened by interstellar dust and we must avoid too heavy a bias against such sight - lines .",
    "therefore , initially targets were selected to have @xmath13 mag , and @xmath14 mag for the smc but @xmath15 mag for the lmc . a higher priority was given to stars with a reddening - free colour ( johnson 1963 ; massey 2007 ) @xmath16 mag ( red symbols in fig .  1 ) . when plotted using also the reddening - free wesenheit index @xmath17 ( madore 1982 , using the canonical value @xmath18 ) the early- and later - type stars separate much more clearly than in the unreddened colour  magnitude diagram .",
    "indeed , the early - type stars trace the star forming regions whereas the later - type stars are concentrated towards the lmc bar in the south ",
    "west corner of the @xmath19 field ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the later - type stars , while not ideal targets for our study , were not excluded from selection entirely as they could still fill some fibres that could not otherwise be allocated . in appendix",
    "a we describe the distribution over known spectral types , confirming the success of our selection strategy .",
    "fiducials ( green triangles in fig .",
    "1 ) were selected from 13th - mag ( v ) stars with @xmath20 mag .",
    "targets or fiducial stars were rejected if other stars were known to affect the signal within the fibre significantly .",
    "sky positions ( blue dots in fig .",
    "1 ) were chosen to be clear of known stars within or near to the fibre .",

    "this is confirmed in the maps we show later , which  as expected  are very different for the different components .    while the spectral resolving power  and intrinsic width of the dibs  did not allow us to identify multiple kinematic components other than ( sometimes ) a second one in the caiik , it is very likely that multiple kinematic components are present in all absorption features and sight - lines ( cf .  van loon et al .",
    "likewise , the caiik and naid absorption may be saturated in some of these components , and an increase of their equivalent width can be caused by stronger line wings as well as additional kinematic components .",
    "the d@xmath31 line has half the intrinsic strength of that of the d@xmath32 line and should therefore be less affected by saturation effects .",
    "while we caution against the use of the equivalent widths of the caiik and naid lines in an absolute sense , a comparative analysis can still be meaningful .",
    "remarkably , the caiik absorption towards the smc is relatively strong compared to the galactic foreground and lmc sight - lines ; the dibs are considerably weaker , though it must be said that the bulk of the absorption within the smc is concentrated in areas much smaller than the @xmath19 field and individual sight - lines can show quite strong dibs .",

    "plotted are not only the secure detections in both relevant features , but also ( with different colours / symbols ) less certain detections and non - detections . while some outliers and some of the scatter are due to uncertainties , there are clear positive correlations between the 5780 and 5797   dibs and with naid but with real ( intrinsic ) scatter also . the equivalent width of the naid@xmath31 line grows slower than in proportion to column density because of saturation effects , giving the false impression of accelerated growth of the dibs .",
    "the galactic foreground shows little difference between the smc and lmc directions , but the smc itself clearly has far fewer sight - lines with strong dib absorption than the lmc ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "strong dib absorption is seen internal to the smc towards star 135 ( smc10196 in massey 2002 ) in the centre of the south  western star - forming complex : @xmath76   and @xmath77  .",
    "the naid absorption is also strong in that direction",
    ". this sight - line passes in between the lha-115n25 ob assocation and the smc - b23 molecular cloud ; possibly it crosses the irradiated skin of a dense cloud , which may explain the strong dib absorption",
    ". similar strength of dib absorption is seen at several locations within the lmc ; the correlation appears to be saturating at @xmath78   while the 5797 dib continues to strengthen beyond @xmath79  .",
    "the two stars that show the strongest 5797   dib in figure 4 are both located within the tarantula nebula ( cf .",
    "van loon et al .  2013 ) .",
    "we performed a search in the literature for know spectral types , thereby mostly relying on the use of simbad ( wenger et al .",
    "2000 ) ; a summary of the pertinent sources for these spectral types is presented in table a1 .",
    "these spectral types have been included in our catalogue , and comprise 174 smc and 61 lmc targets .",
    "their distribution over spectral type and luminosity class is presented in figure a1 .",
    "the more extensive coverage of the smc includes also more later ( a ) type stars , whilst the known spectral types for lmc sources tend to include more o - type classes .",
    "most of the targets with known spectral type are mid - b ( smc ) or early - b ( lmc ) .",
    "the question arises concerning the contribution from stellar photospheric absorption to the measurements of the calcium and sodium lines . indeed",
    ", equivalent widths of the caiik line can reach 0.10.2   at solar metallicity ( mihalas 1973 ; keenan et al .",
    "figure a2 , however , exhibits no dependence of the caiik absorption on spectral type , except perhaps for the a type stars that seem to have larger equivalent widths ( but that are few in number ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the stronger ( blue ) kinematic component is mostly 0.20.4   and thereby larger than what is expected for the stellar photosphere of ( metal - poor ) o- and b - type stars ; the other ( red ) kinematic component is often much weaker but the same insensitivity to spectral type holds true .",
    "the same conclusion is reached for the naid@xmath32 ( blue ) and d@xmath31 ( red ) lines ( bottom panel in figure a2 ) .",
    "we can also remark that the caiik absorption is of similar strength in the smc and lmc , whereas we would have expected a clear difference if it mainly originated in the stellar photospheres due to the considerable difference in metallicity between the young populations of the smc and lmc .",
    "the naid absorption , on the other hand , does show the expected scaling with metallicity  but this can also be explained if it were of purely interstellar origin ."
