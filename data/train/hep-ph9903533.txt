    "there have been many attempts to study the nucleon - nucleon interaction starting from a system of six interacting quarks described by a constituent quark model .",
    "these models explain the short range repulsion as due to the colour magnetic part of the one gluon exchange ( oge ) interaction between quarks and due to quark interchanges between two @xmath1 clusters @xcite . to the oge interaction it was necessary to add a scalar and a pseudoscalar meson exchange interaction between quarks of different @xmath1 clusters in order to explain the intermediate- and long - range attraction between two nucleons @xcite .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we have calculated the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) interaction potential at zero - separation distance between two three - quark clusters in the frame of a constituent quark model @xcite where the quarks interact via pseudoscalar meson i.e. goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) instead of oge .",
    "an important motivation in using the gbe model is that it describes well the baryon spectra . in particular",
    ", it correctly reproduces the order of positive and negative parity states both for nonstrange @xcite and strange @xcite baryons where the oge model has failed .",
    "the underlying symmetry of the gbe model is related to the flavour - spin @xmath3 group . combining it with the @xmath4 symmetry , a thorough analysis performed for the @xmath5 baryons",
    "@xcite has shown that the chiral quark picture leads to more satisfactory fits to the observed baryon spectrum than the oge models .",
    "the one - pion exchange potential between quarks appears naturally as an iteration of the instanton induced interaction in the t - channel @xcite .",
    "the meson exchange picture is also supported by explicit qcd latice calculations @xcite .",
    "another motivation in using the gbe model is that the exchange interaction contains the basic ingredients required by the @xmath2 problem .",
    "its long - range part , required to provide the long - range @xmath2 interaction , is a yukawa - type potential depending on the mass of the exchange meson , its short - range part , of opposite sign to the long - range one , is mainly responsible for the good description of the baryon spectra @xcite and also induces a short - range repulsion in the @xmath2 system , both in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels @xcite .",
    "the present study is an extention of @xcite and we calculate here the interaction potential between two @xmath1 clusters as a function of @xmath8 , the separation distance between the centres of the clusters .",
    "this separation distance is a good approximation of the jacobi relative coordinate between the two clusters . under this assumption , here we calculate the interaction potential in the adiabatic ( born - oppenheimer ) approximation , as explained below .",
    "a common issue in solving the @xmath2 problem is the construction of adequate six - quark basis states .",
    "the usual choice is a cluster model basis @xcite . in calculating the potential at zero - separation distance , in ref .",
    "@xcite we used molecular - type orbitals @xcite and compared the results with those based on cluster model single - particle states .",
    "the molecular orbitals have the proper axially and reflectionally symmetries and can be constructed from appropriate combinations of two - centre gaussians . at zero - separation between the @xmath1 clusters",
    "the six - quark states obtained from such orbitals contain certain @xmath9 configurations which are missing in the cluster model basis . by using molecular orbitals , in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that the height of the repulsion reduces by about 22 % and 25 % in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels respectively with respect to cluster model results .",
    "it is therefore useful to analyse the role of molecular orbitals at distances @xmath10 . by construction , at @xmath11 the molecular orbital states are simple parity conserving linear combinations of cluster model states .",
    "their role is expected to be important at short range at least .",
    "they also have the advantage of forming an orthogonal and complete basis while the cluster model ( two - centre ) states are not orthogonal and are overcomplete .",
    "for this reason we found that in practice they are more convenient to be used than the cluster model basis , where one must carefully @xcite consider the limit @xmath12 . here too , for the purpose of comparison we perform calculations both in the cluster model and the molecular orbital basis .    in sec .",
    "2 we recall the procedure of constructing molecular orbital single - particle states starting from the two - centre gaussians used in the cluster model calculations . in sec .",
    "3 the gbe hamiltonian is presented .",
    "is devoted to the results obtained for the @xmath2 potential . in sec",
    "5 we introduce a middle range attraction through a scalar meson exchange interaction between quarks parametrized consistently with the pseudoscalar meson exchange .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary and conclusions .",
    "in the cluster model one can define states which in the limit of large intercluster separation @xmath8 are right @xmath13 and left @xmath14 states @xmath15 in the simplest cluster model basis these are ground state harmonic oscillator wave functions centered at @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "they contain a parameter @xmath18 which is fixed variationally to minimize the nucleon mass described as a @xmath1 cluster within a given hamiltonian .",
    "the states ( 1 ) are normalized but are not orthogonal at finite @xmath8 .",
    "they have good parity about their centers but not about their common center @xmath19 .    from @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 one constructs six - quark states of given orbital symmetry @xmath20_o$ ] .",
    "the totally antisymmetric six - quark states also contain a flavour - spin part of symmetry @xmath20_{fs}$ ] and a colour part of symmetry @xmath21_c$ ] . in the cluster model",

    "these eigenstates have therefore good parity and good angular momentum projection . as in the cluster model basis where one uses the two lowest states @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in the molecular orbital basis we also consider the two lowest states , @xmath29 , of positive parity and @xmath30 , of negative parity . from these",

    "ensures that the same @xmath8 is used both in the molecular and the cluster model basis .    from @xmath43 as well as from @xmath44 orbitals",
    "one can construct six - quark states of required permutation symmetry .",
    "for the @xmath45 symmetries relevant for the @xmath2 problem the transformations between six - quark states expressed in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath44 states are given in table i of ref .",
    "this table shows that in the limit @xmath12 six - quark states obtained from molecular orbitals contain configurations of type @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",

    ". the results are practically identical for @xmath125 = ( 01 ) and @xmath125 = ( 10 ) . note that @xmath124 is normalized such as to be identical to @xmath8 at large @xmath8 .",
    "one can see that the cluster model gives @xmath126 at @xmath100 , consistent with the spherical symmetry of the system , while the molecular basis result is @xmath127 fm at @xmath100 , wich suggests that the system acquires a small deformation in the molecular basis .",
    "this also means that its r.m.s . radius is larger in the molecular basis .    in figs .",
    "9 and 10 we plot the adiabatic potentials as a function of @xmath124 instead of @xmath8 , for @xmath125 = ( 01 ) and ( 10 ) respectively . as @xmath128 at any @xmath8 in the molecular orbital basis , the corresponding potential is shifted to the right and appears above the cluster model potential at finite values of @xmath124 but tends asymptotically to the same value . the comparison made in figs .",
    "9 and 10 is meaningful in the context of a schrdinger type equation where the local adiabatic potential appears in conjunction with an `` effective mass '' depending on @xmath124 also .",
    "however an effective mass can be obtain through rgm calculations and our future plan is to perform such calculations .",
    "in principle we expected some attraction at large @xmath8 due to the presence of the yukawa potential tail in eq .",
    "( 23 ) . to see the net contribution of this part of the quark - quark interaction we repeated the calculations in the molecular orbital basis by completely removing the first term - the yukawa potential part - in eq .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "11 . for @xmath113= ( 10 ) .",
    "one can see that beyond @xmath129 fm the contribution of the yukawa potential tail is very small , of the order of 1 - 2 mev . at small values of @xmath8 the yukawa part of ( 23 )",
    "contributes to increase the adiabatic potential because it diminishes the attraction in the two body matrix elements .",
    "the missing medium- and long - range attraction can in principle be simulated in a simple phenomenological way .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite this has been achieved at the baryon level .",
    "here we adopt a more consistent procedure assuming that besides the pseudoscalar meson exchange interaction of sec .",
    "iii there exists an additional scalar , @xmath29-meson exchange interaction between quarks .",
    "this is in the spirit of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking mechanism on which the gbe model is based .",
    "the @xmath29-meson is the chiral partner of the pion and it should be considered explicitly .    actually once the one - pion exchange interaction between quarks is admitted , one can inquire about the role of at least two - pion exchanges .",
    "recently it was found @xcite that the two - pion exchange also plays a significant role in the quark - quark interaction .",
    "it enhances the effect of the isospin dependent spin - spin component of the one - pion exchange interaction and cancels out its tensor component .",
    "apart from that it gives rise to a spin independent central component , which averaged over the isospin wave function of the nucleon it produces an attractive spin independent interaction .",
    "these findings also support the introduction of a scalar ( @xmath29-meson ) exchange interaction between quarks as an approximate description of the two - pion exchange loops .    for consistency with the parametrization @xcite we consider here a scalar quark - quark interaction of the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 = 675 mev and @xmath132 , @xmath133 and the coupling constant @xmath134 are arbitrary parameters . in order to be effective at medium - range separation between nucleons",
    "we expect this interaction to have @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "note that the factor @xmath137 has only been introduced for dimensional reasons .",
    "we first looked at the baryon spectrum with the same variational parameters as before .",
    "the only modification is a shift of the whole spectrum which would correspond to taking @xmath138 mev in eq .",
    "( 21 ) .    for the @xmath139 system we performed calculations in the molecular basis , which is more appropriate than the cluster model basis .",
    "we found that the resulting adiabatic potential is practically insensitive to changes in @xmath131 and @xmath132 but very sensitive to @xmath133 . in fig .",
    "12 we show results for @xmath140 one can see that @xmath141 produces indeed an attractive pocket , deeper for @xmath113 = ( 10 ) than for ( 01 ) , as it should be for the @xmath2 problem .",
    "the depth of the attraction depends essentially on @xmath133 .",
    "the precise values of the parameters entering eq .",
    "( 32 ) should be determined in further rgm calculations . as mentioned above the born - oppenheimer potential",
    "is in fact the diagonal rgm kernel .",
    "it is interesting that an attractive pocket is seen in this kernel when a @xmath29-meson exchange interaction is combined with pseudoscalar meson exchange and oge interactions ( hybrid model ) , the whole being fitted to the @xmath2 problem @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath2 potential in the adiabatic approximation as a function of @xmath8 , the separation distance between the centres of the two @xmath1 clusters .",
    "we used a constituent quark model where quarks interact via pseudoscalar meson exchange .",
    "the orbital part of the six - quark states was constructed either from cluster model or molecular orbital single particle states .",
    "the latter are more realistic , having the proper axially and reflectionally symmetries .",
    "also technically they are more convenient .",
    "we explicitly showed that they are important at small values of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular we found that the @xmath2 potential obtained in the molecular orbital basis has a less repulsive core than the one obtained in the cluster model basis .",
    "however none of the bases leads to an attractive pocket .",
    "we have simulated this attraction by introducing a @xmath29-meson exchange interaction between quarks .    to have a better understanding of the two bases",
    "we have also calculated the quadrupole mement of the @xmath139 system as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the results show that in the molecular orbital basis the system acquires some small deformation at @xmath100 . as a function of the quadrupole moment",
    "the adiabatic potential looks more repulsive in the molecular orbital basis then in the cluster model basis . in this light one might naively expect that the molecular basis will lead to scattering phase - shifts having a more repulsive behaviour .",
    "the present calculations give us an idea about the size and shape of the hard core produced by the gbe interaction .",
    "except for small values of @xmath8 the two bases give rather similar potentials .",
    "taking @xmath8 as a generator coordinate the following step is to perform a dynamical study based on the resonating group method which will provide phase - shifts to be compared to the experiment .",
    "the present results constitute an intermediate step towards such a study .",
    "in this appendix we study the behaviour of the confinement potential in the molecular orbital basis at large separation distance @xmath8 between the centres of two @xmath1 clusters . as an example we consider the state @xmath142_o [ 33]_{fs}\\rangle$ ] . through the fractional parentage technique @xcite",
    "the six - body matrix elements can be reduced to the calculation of two - body matrix elements . using this technique and integrating in the color space one obtains @xmath143_o [ 33]_{fs } | v_{conf } | 42^+[42]_o [ 33]_{fs}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{40}~ [ 22 \\langle \\pi\\pi |v| \\pi\\pi\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{3cm}\\mbox{}+ 76 \\langle \\sigma\\pi |v| \\sigma\\pi \\rangle   + 26 \\langle \\sigma\\pi |v| \\pi\\sigma\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{3cm}\\mbox{}- 58 \\langle \\pi\\pi",

    "according to eq .",
    "( 8) for @xmath11 one has @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "most of these martix elements vanish asymptotically .",
    "the only surviving ones are @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are some constants .",
    "this brings to the following asymptotic behaviour of the matrix elements in the right - hand side of ( 34 ) @xmath149 from which it follows that @xmath150_o [ 33]_{fs } | v_{conf } | 42^+[42]_o [ 33]_{fs}\\rangle   \\rightarrow ( 11~a~+~19~b~z)/10\\ ] ] i.e. this matrix element grows linearly with @xmath8 at large @xmath8 . in a similar manner",
