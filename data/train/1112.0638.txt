    "schur - weyl duality is a duality between two subgroups of the general linear group on @xmath1 : the collective action of the unitary group @xmath2 , and the canonical representation of the group @xmath3 of permutations of the @xmath0 systems .",
    "it asserts that there is a one - to - one map between the irreducible representations of the two groups , and that their product is multiplicity - free .",
    "alternatively , one can characterize the duality as the fact that the complex algebra spanned by one of these groups is the commutant of the one spanned by the other .",
    "the generalization we derive here is also between two subgroups of the general linear group on @xmath1 .",
    "one is the collective action of a subgroup @xmath4 of @xmath2 that has a particular property , namely , that it is equal to the centralizer of its centralizer in @xmath2 .",
    "we call such a group a _ gauge _ group ( for reasons that will be explained shortly ) . the other is the group closure of the local action of @xmath5 ( the centralizer of @xmath4 ) and the canonical representation of the permutation group @xmath3 .",
    "schur - weyl duality is included as the special case where @xmath6 .    just as schur - weyl duality has many applications to quantum information theory and quantum algorithms ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) ,",
    "so too does this generalization .",
    "this article will explore some of these applications .",
    "one such application is to finding noiseless subsystems ( this is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : noiseless ] ) . however , most of the applications will rely on a particular consequence which connects global symmetries with local symmetries , considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : promote ] .    for @xmath7 an arbitrary operator on @xmath1",
    ", we say that @xmath7 has _ global symmetry _ with respect to the subgroup @xmath8 of @xmath2 if it is invariant under the collective action of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 and we say that @xmath7 has _ local symmetry _ with respect to @xmath8 if it is invariant under the local action of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath10 note that any operator which has local symmetry with respect to @xmath8 automatically also has global symmetry with respect to @xmath8 but the converse implication does not necessarily hold .",
    "indeed , generally the condition of local symmetry is much stronger than that of global symmetry .",
    "the duality implies that within the symmetric and the antisymmetric subspaces of @xmath1 , the collective action of a gauge group @xmath4 is dual to the collective action of @xmath5 , its centralizer in @xmath11 .",
    "this in turn implies that if an operator is confined to the symmetric or antisymmetric subspace and has _ global _ symmetry with respect to the gauge group @xmath4 , then it must also have _ local _ symmetry with respect to @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "our generalization of schur - weyl duality allows in some circumstances for a global symmetry to be promoted to a local symmetry .",
    "the main application we consider is the problem of how to best estimate parameters describing a quantum state given multiple copies of the state ( this is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimation ] ) .",
    "the parameters might consist of expectation values of some observables , or they might encode a decision about the state , such as whether a given expectation value is positive or not .",
    "in particular , we seek to determine under what circumstances it is sufficient to do independent measurements on each copy and in what circumstances more complicated measurements , for instance , using entanglement , are required .",
    "( as it turns out , there are many circumstances wherein entangled measurements do help . )",
    "a very simple example of such a multi - copy estimation problem is the one considered by hayashi _",
    "a pure state is chosen uniformly according to the haar measure , and @xmath0 copies of the state are prepared .",
    "the goal is to estimate the expectation value of an observable @xmath12 for the state .",
    "_ have shown that for a squared - error figure of merit , the optimal estimation scheme is to simply measure the observable @xmath12 separately on each system .",
    "our generalization of schur - weyl duality can be used to provide a very elementary proof of this result .",
    "it can also be used to simplify the solution of estimation problems that are much more complicated , as we shall show .",
    "the reason we can make use of our generalization of schur - weyl duality is that a multi - copy estimation problem can be shown to naturally have a global symmetry for a gauge group .",
    "measurements with global symmetry relative to a gauge group are described by povms all the elements of which have this symmetry . in this case",
    ", the duality tells us that the global symmetry can be promoted to a local symmetry , so it suffices to consider measurements on the @xmath0 copies that have _ local symmetry _ relative to the gauge group .",
    "we can now explain how this promotion of global symmetries to local symmetries immediately leads to the solution of the multi - copy estimation problem considered by hayashi _",
    "et al._. the prior is uniform over pure states and the squared error figure of merit only relies on the observable @xmath13 that one is trying to estimate .",
    "consequently , the description of this problem has symmetry with respect to the group of all unitaries which commute with @xmath13 and it follows that , on the multi - copy system , it suffices to perform measurements that have global symmetry with respect to this group . but this group is a gauge group , i.e. it is equal to the centralizer of its centralizer in the unitary group , and so by our result , one can promote this global symmetry to a local symmetry . finally , noting that all measurement operators that are invariant under the local action of the gauge group must be in the algebra generated by the set @xmath14 it follows that one can simply measure @xmath13 on each copy individually and do classical processing on the outcomes to achieve the optimal estimation .",
    "we also immediately see that even if the figure of merit is not the squared error and the prior over pure states is not uniform , as long as these depend only on @xmath13 , then an individual measurement on each copy continues to be optimal .    in more complicated examples , wherein there may be many observables to be estimated , a non - uniform prior over pure states and an arbitrary figure of merit ,",
    "as long as the problem still has some gauge symmetry we can exploit our result to infer that the optimal measurement on the @xmath0 copies should have local symmetry with respect to the gauge group .",
    "in particular , if the commutant of the gauge group is a commutative algebra , then it suffices to implement independent measurements of the generator of this algebra on each system .",
    "this occurs if the problem is to estimate a set of commuting observables , and the figure of merit and the prior over pure states can be entirely described in terms of this set of observables ( hence , no entanglement is needed ) .",
    "furthermore , even if the commutant of the problem s gauge group is not a commutative algebra , so that independent measurements are _ not _ sufficient , nonetheless local symmetry is still a stronger constraint than global symmetry and consequently our result can lead to a bound on how much interaction between the systems is required to achieve the optimal measurement .",
    "we also demonstrate several other generalizations of the basic multi - copy estimation problem  to cases which include mixed states and to cases where the channel between the source and the estimator can be noisy  such that our results still have nontrivial consequences for the optimal measurement .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that our result has applications for estimation problems where the estimator gets only a single copy of the system of interest , and the distinction between global and local symmetries is relative to the partitioning of the system of interest into its components . in particular , we obtain strong constraints on the optimal measurement in the case of a system with _ two _ components because the permutation group on two systems has only irreducible representations over the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces and our duality only permits an inference from global symmetry to local symmetry within the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces .",
    "this is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : bipartite ] .    given that the class of estimation problems for which our results apply is very large , they represent a dramatic expansion , relative to previously known results , in the scope of problems for which we can easily determine the optimal measurement .",
    "furthermore , in previous results where independent measurements on each copy were shown to be optimal , such as ref .",
    "@xcite , the reasoning was rather _",
    "ad hoc_. it was not clear what feature of the estimation problem implied the sufficiency of such measurements .",
    "by contrast , our approach follows a clear methodology  we are determining the consequences of the gauge symmetries of the estimation problem .",
    "our results establish a sufficient condition for the optimality of independent measurements , , i.e. the lack of any need for adaptive or entangled measurements .",
    "it is that the set of single - copy observables that are needed to define the estimation problem form a _ commutative _ set . in a slogan , _",
    "the commutativity of the observables defining the estimation problem imply the adequacy of independent measurements . _",
    "for a complex vector space @xmath15 , define @xmath16 to be the set of linear maps from @xmath15 to itself ( endomorphism ) .",
    "this set has a natural structure of algebra and is called the full matrix algebra over @xmath15 .",
    "any matrix algebra defined on @xmath15 is a subalgebra of @xmath16 . throughout this paper",
    "we only consider finite dimensional vector spaces .    for any vector space @xmath15 , and any set @xmath17 we call the set of all operators in @xmath16 which commute with @xmath18 the _ commutant _ of @xmath18 and denote it by @xmath19 .",
    "note that for any arbitrary set @xmath17 , its commutant , i.e. @xmath19 , is an algebra .",
    "let @xmath17 be a set of hermitian operators , i.e. @xmath20 . then it holds that    @xmath21    where by @xmath22 we mean the complex matrix algebra generated by the set @xmath18 and @xmath23 ( identity operator on @xmath15 ) . any such complex matrix algebra which includes identity operator and",

    "_ finite dimensional von neumann algebra_. note that eq.([com - com ] ) means that for any finite dimensional von neumann algebra @xmath25 @xmath26 which is the defining property of these algebras . in this paper",
    "we only use this type of algebras and whenever we refer to an object as an algebra we mean a finite dimensional von neumann algebra . note that for any subgroup @xmath8 of the unitary group the algebra spanned by @xmath8 , @xmath27 , is a von neumann algebra .",

    "then schur - weyl duality states that    ( * schur - weyl duality * ) the following two algebras are commutants of one another in @xmath62    1 .",

    "furthermore , the theorem implies that the action of @xmath71 is multiplicity - free on @xmath1 .    in the following section",
    ", we present a generalization of schur - weyl duality for the case of _ gauge _ subgroups of @xmath72 .",
    "for any subgroup @xmath4 of @xmath2 let @xmath5 denotes the centralizer of @xmath4 in @xmath2 i.e. the set of all elements of @xmath2 which commutes with all elements of @xmath4",
    ". also denote the centralizer of the centralizer of @xmath4 by @xmath73 . then in general @xmath74 .",
    "we call a unitary group @xmath4 a _ gauge group _",
    "if @xmath75 .",
    "the fact that in any arbitrary group and for any arbitrary subgroup @xmath8 , @xmath76 implies that @xmath77 .",
    "so for arbitrary subgroup @xmath8 of @xmath2 , its centralizer @xmath40 is a gauge group .",
    "equivalently , one can think of a gauge group as the set of all unitaries in @xmath78 which commute with a von neumann algebra @xmath79 .",
    "this is true because for any subgroup @xmath4 of @xmath2 , @xmath80 is equal to all the unitries which commute with @xmath5 or equivalently all the unitaries which commute with @xmath81 ( which is a von neumann algebra ) .",
    "so if @xmath75 then @xmath4 is equal to the set of all unitaries which commute with an algebra , namely @xmath81 . on the other hand , if @xmath4 is equal to the set of all unitaries in @xmath78 which commute with an algebra @xmath79 then @xmath5 is equal to all the unitaries in the algebra @xmath25 and so is a basis for this algebra .",
    "since @xmath80 is equal to the set of all the unitaries which commute with @xmath5 , and @xmath5 is a basis for @xmath25 , then @xmath80 is equal to the set of all unitaries which commute with the algebra @xmath25 and so is equal to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , these two definitions of gauge group are equivalent .",
    "this discussion implies that one way to specify a gauge group is to specify the von neumann algebra of operators which commute with the gauge group , for instance by specifying the generators of that algebra .",
    "we call the gauge group formed by all unitaries which commute with a von neumann algebra @xmath25 _ the gauge group of _ @xmath25 and denote it by @xmath82 . note that if @xmath82 is the gauge group of @xmath25 then it holds that    @xmath83    using this together with commutation theorem for tensor product eq.([com - tensor - product ] ) and eq.([comm - alg ] ) we find @xmath84    also note that eq.([com - gauge ] ) implies that any von neumann algebra can be uniquely specified by its gauge group .    now based on this observation that any gauge group can be thought as the set of unitaries commuting with a von neumann algebra characterizing the set of all gauge groups is equivalent to characterizing all von neumann algebras which is done by eq.([decom - algeb ] ) .",
    "this decomposition implies that @xmath82 the gauge group of @xmath25 , has a unique decomposition up to unitary equivalence of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is identity on @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in other words , for any set of integers @xmath89 there is a gauge group acting on @xmath90 which is isomorphic to @xmath91 iff there is a set of positive integers @xmath92 such that @xmath93",
    ". in particular , for any vector space @xmath90 , there are gauge groups isomorphic to @xmath94 and @xmath2 .",
    "these gauge groups can be respectively thought as the gauge group of the algebra of all diagonal matrices in some orthonormal basis and the algebra generated by identity matrix .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath95 the set of all gauge groups can be classified in the following three types : i ) @xmath96 which corresponds to the group @xmath97\\}$ ] where @xmath23 is the identity operator , ii ) @xmath98 which corresponds to the group @xmath99 iii ) @xmath100 which corresponds to the group @xmath101\\}\\ ] ] for any arbitrary orthonormal basis @xmath102 .",
    "note that this characterization implies that any non - trivial gauge group is a unimodular lie group , i.e. its left invariant measure is equal to the right invariant measure ( up to a constant ) .    throughout this paper we will extensively use the uniform twirling over subgroups of unitary group with respect to unique ( normalized ) haar measure of @xmath8 denoted by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the normalized haar measure of @xmath8 . since @xmath104 is the uniform measure any operator in the image of @xmath105 commutes with @xmath8 .",
    "therefore if @xmath82 is the gauge group of a von neumann algebra @xmath25 then the image of @xmath106 is inside the algebra @xmath25 .    finally , it is worth noting that if @xmath4 is a gauge group then the two groups @xmath4 and @xmath5 are dual reductive pairs .",
    "however , the inverse is not true , i.e. if two groups are dual reductive pairs , they are not necessarily each other s centralizers in the group of all unitaries . for example , according to the schur - weyl duality , the canonical representation of the permutation group on @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath61 , and the collective action of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath64 , are dual reductive pairs but they are surely not equal to one another s centralizer in the group of all unitares acting on @xmath1 .      for a subgroup @xmath8 of @xmath2",
    "we denote @xmath107 to be the group @xmath108 . also , let @xmath109 denote the group acting on @xmath54 which is generated by the two groups @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "note that every element of @xmath109 can be written in the canonical form of @xmath112 for a unique @xmath113 and a unique @xmath114 .",
    "this implies a homomorphism from @xmath109 to @xmath67 with the kernel @xmath110 , and therefore @xmath115",
    ".    then one can prove the following generalization of schur - weyl duality    [ cor - pairs ] ( * generalization of schur - weyl duality * ) suppose @xmath4 and @xmath5 are one another s centralizers in the group of unitaries @xmath116 .",
    "then the following two algebras are commutants of one another in @xmath62    1 .",

    "then @xmath121    this form of theorem is particularly useful and has a straightforward physical interpretation which we will point out in the next section and discuss in more details in @xcite .",
    "theorem [ cor - pairs ] together with the proposition [ prop - doub - comm ] implies that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the irreps of the group @xmath4 which show up in representation @xmath118 on @xmath1 and the irreps of the group @xmath120 which show up in this space .",
    "furthermore , the theorem implies that the representation of @xmath122 is multiplicity - free on @xmath1 . note that in the specific case of @xmath6 ( where @xmath5 is the trivial group ) this dual reductive pair reduces to the well - known schur - weyl duality .",
    "also note that the fact that each of the algebras in this theorem is in the commutant of the other algebra is trivial .",

    "we provide a simple example illustrating this fact in appendix  [ app - count - ex0 ] .    to prove theorem [ cor - pairs ] we use the following property of gauge groups which is proven in appendix  [ sec - proof ] ..

    "our generalization of schur - weyl duality appears very intuitive if one considers a particular problem concerning two independent observers using different conventions to describe quantum systems .",
    "suppose that alice and bob each use their own personal convention to associate observables with operators in the hilbert space of a system , and assume that each observer is not aware of the other s convention .",

    "this theorem will be particularly useful in the rest of this paper .",
    "finally , it is worth to emphasize on the importance of the restriction to symmetric and anti - symmetric subspaces in the results of this section . as we have argued before , the fact that @xmath4 is a gauge group plays a crucial role in theorem [ cor - pairs ] ( and therefore theorems [ thm - sym ] and [ pro - map - s ] ) .",

    "schur - weyl duality has many applications in quantum information theory and so we expect that this generalization will as well . here",
    "we present two specific important examples of these applications .",
    "the first example is about finding noiseless subystems for collective noise associated with a gauge group , and the second is about how , for @xmath0 copies of a system in a pure state confined to the symmetric or antisymmetric subspace , a measurement with global symmetry relative to a gauge group can be simulated by one that has local symmetry for that group .",
    "this second result is the seed of the next section , where we will consider the consequences for multi - copy estimation problems in more depth .",
    "many applications of schur - weyl duality in quantum information theory are based on the fact that it provides a simple characterization of all operators in @xmath203 which commute with @xmath64 or conversely all operators in @xmath203 which commute with @xmath67 .",
    "theorem [ cor - pairs ] and its corollary [ cor - gauge - com ] immediately yield a characterization of operators with global symmetry under a gauge group @xmath4  they lie in the span of the local action of @xmath5 and the action of the permutation group .",
    "similarly , corollary [ thm - sym ] yields a characterization of operators confined to the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces that have global symmetry under @xmath4 .",
    "these are simply the operators in the span of the collective action of @xmath5 .    a straightforward application of this characterization is to find noiseless subsystems . in the following",
    "we present a simple example of this .",
    "we begin by reviewing the standard story about noiseless subsystems .",
    "suppose one is going to send quantum information through a noisy qubit channel , where the noise is described by a unitary that is sampled at random , but wherein the same unitary acts on each qubit .",
    "for example , the qubits could be spin @xmath204 particles with a nonzero mangetic moment and the noise could be due to a random magnetic field . as another example",
    ", the qubits could be realized as the polarization of photons sent through a fiber - optic cable and the noise could be due to random strains in the cable that induce changes in the polarization . in many cases ,",
    "it is a good approximation to assume that the noise varies slowly compared to the interval between the qubits as they pass down the channel ( or that it varies little on the distance scale between the qubits in the case of a quantum memory ) , in which case one can assume that the same random unitary is applied to all @xmath0 qubits .",
    "then it turns out that , due to the symmetry of the noise , it is possible to encode classical and quantum information in the @xmath0 qubit system in such a way that it remains unaffected by the noise@xcite . to see this , note that under these assumptions , the noise is described by the group @xmath205 .",
    "any state in the commutant of @xmath205 is invariant under the noise .",
    "furthermore , any state in the span of @xmath67 has this property as well . now using schur - weyl duality",
    "one can conclude that the span of @xmath67 is equal to the commutant of @xmath205 and therefore _ every _ state which is unaffected by this type of noise is in the span of @xmath67 .    in a more general model",
    ", the system sent through the channel may have other degrees of freedom which can potentially be used to send quantum information . in other words , the hilbert space describing each particle sent through the channel is not @xmath206 but it is @xmath207 where the finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath208 describes another degree of freedom which is invariant under the noise in the channel . for example , in the case of photons one can use time - bin encoding in addition to the polarization encoding to encode an extra qubit in each photon .",
    "but the time - bin qubit does not suffer from depolarization or polarization mode - dispersion .",
    "in other words , this degree of freedom is invariant under polarization noise .",
    "so we assume the noise in the channel is described by a random unitary in the form of @xmath209 where @xmath210 and it acts on @xmath206 and @xmath211 is the identity operator acting on @xmath208 . in the case of a single system sent through the channel ( @xmath212 ) , it is clear that any information encoded in the subsystem @xmath208 is preserved under this type of noise .",
    "consider the case of many systems sent through the channel ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "the question is what are the set of all states of the @xmath0 systems which are invariant under this type of noise . in other words ,",
    "what is the set of all states which commute with @xmath214 ?",
    "clearly , in this case , the usual form of schr - weyl duality does not apply .",
    "but one can use the generalization of schur - duality we presented in the previous section to find these density operators .    to see this",
    ", first note that the group of unitaries @xmath215 is the gauge group of the algebra @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the identity operator on @xmath206",
    ". then corollary [ cor - gauge - com ] ( which is indeed another version of theorem [ cor - pairs ] ) gives the characterization of all operators which commutes with @xmath118 : that is basically the set of all operators in @xmath218 .",
    "so the set of all density operators in this algebra is exactly the set of all states which remains unaffected under this type of noise .",
    "this means that to protect information one needs to encode it in either the invariant degree of freedom of each subsystem ( @xmath208 ) or in the permutational degree of freedom .",
    "again note that even without using our results it is straightforward to see that all of these states remains unchanged under this noise .",
    "the non - trivial consequence of corollary is that this algebra includes all such density operators .",
    "note that if the group @xmath123 describing the noise is not a gauge group then the @xmath219 can be larger than @xmath220 as it is shown by a simple example in appendix [ app - count - ex0 ] ( where the group @xmath8 is the @xmath221 representation of @xmath222 in @xmath223 ) .",
    "this means that , unlike the case of noise described by a gauge group , one can encode quantum information in a space which is larger than the permutational degree of freedom of the systems together with the invariant degrees of freedom of each system .",
    "another important application of this new duality is that in particular cases one can _ promote a global symmetry to local symmetry _ as we will describe in this section .",
    "recall the definition of local and global symmetries for an arbitrary operator @xmath224 .",
    "@xmath7 has a global symmetry with respect to the symmetry group @xmath123 if @xmath7 is invariant under the collective action of @xmath8 , as specified in eq .",
    ", i.e. if @xmath225 .",
    "similarly we say that @xmath7 has local symmetry with respect to the symmetry group @xmath8 if it is invariant under the local action of @xmath8 , as specified in eq .  ,",
    "i.e. if @xmath226 .    as noted in the introduction , the condition of local symmetry is generally much stronger than global symmetry .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is the group of rotations then global symmetry of a hamiltonian with respect to @xmath8 implies that the vector of the total angular momentum of @xmath0 systems is a constant of the motion in the dynamics generated by this hamiltonian .",
    "however , in this case the angular momenta of the subsystems are not necessarily conserved and the @xmath0 subsystems can exchange angular momentum with one another . on the other hand , having a hamiltonian with local symmetry with respect to the group of rotation implies the existence of non - trivial constants of motion defined on each of the @xmath0 subsystems .",
    "so in this case we will have @xmath0 conserved vectors of angular momentums and under this type of hamiltonian , subsystems can not exchange angular momentum .",
    "now consider the case where the symmetry under consideration is described by a gauge group @xmath82 of a von neumann algebra @xmath79 .",
    "note that if @xmath227 has global symmetry with respect to @xmath82 then @xmath154 will also have global symmetry with respect to @xmath82 . then according to theorem [ pro - map - s ] for any operator @xmath7 with global symmetry with respect to @xmath82",
    "there is an operator @xmath182 which has local symmetry with respect to @xmath82 and is equal to @xmath7 within the symmetric ( anti - symmetric ) subspace , @xmath228 one can choose @xmath229 where @xmath185 is the completely positive , unital superoperator defined in theorem [ pro - map - s ] . so using the terminology of local and global symmetry we can interpret theorem [ pro - map - s ] as _ promoting global symmetry to local symmetry_.    in the following we explore the important consequence of promoting global symmetry to local symmetry for the case of measurements .",
    "the most general type of measurement that can be performed on a quantum system can be described by a povm ( positive operator - valued measure ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consider a povm @xmath230 .",
    "here , @xmath231 denotes the space of outcomes of the measurement .",
    "this is a measure space equipped with a @xmath232-algebra of subsets , denoted by @xmath233 .",
    "the elements of the @xmath232-algebra are subsets of @xmath231 , where @xmath234 corresponds to the event that the outcome of measurement is an element of @xmath235 .",
    "we say a povm @xmath230 has global / local symmetry with respect to the group @xmath123 if for any @xmath236 , the operator @xmath237 has global / local symmetry with respect to @xmath8 , i.e. it satisfies eq.([global ] ) or eq.([local ] ) respectively .",
    "again , typically the local symmetry condition on a measurement is a much more restrictive condition .    in the following we",
    "first explore the consequences of a measurement having local symmetry and we see how in the case of gauge symmetries using the generalization of schur - weyl duality and in particular theorem [ pro - map - s ] , one can promote global symmetry of a measurement to a local symmetry ( for states whose support is restricted to the symmetric or anti - symmetric subspace ) . since the locally symmetric measurements typically are a much smaller class of measurements , this technique will be particularly useful in quantum estimation problems where one seeks to find the measurement that optimizes some figure of merit . also , this trick is useful for determining whether a given estimation problem requires a nonlocal measurement on the @xmath0 subsystems ( i.e one that requires a quantum channel or entanglement ) or whether a local measurement suffices .",
    "more generally , it can set an upper bound on the amount of entanglement required to achieve a particular degree of success in estimation . in the following",
    "we explain more about this .",
    "one way to understand the restriction of local symmetry of measurement is via the following observation : let the subgroup @xmath8 of @xmath2 be a subgroup with unique haar measure @xmath104 and consider the twirling superoperator defined in eq.([def : twirling ] ) .",
    "then local symmetry of povm @xmath230 with respect to @xmath8 implies that @xmath238 .",
    "this in turn implies that for any event @xmath236 and for any arbitrary density operator in @xmath203 it holds that @xmath239 in other words , for any arbitrary state @xmath240 if before measurement @xmath7 , we apply the local twirling operation @xmath105 , then we do not disturb the statistics of the measurement @xmath7 . note that by applying the twirling operation before the measurement , we are mapping the state to @xmath241 which typically can be much smaller than the space of all density operators in @xmath203 .",
    "applying this twirling operation decreases the size of the subsystems of the hilbert space on which the state could be non - trivial and , as we will see later , this fact can set an upper bound on the amount of entanglement required to achieve a particular inference .",
    "this is more clear in the case of gauge groups .",
    "let @xmath82 be the gauge group of a von neumann algebra @xmath79 .",
    "then for any state @xmath240 , the state @xmath242 is in @xmath138 . using the decomposition of the matrix algebra @xmath25 given by eq.([decom - algeb ] ) , one can find a simple characterization of the form of state @xmath242 for arbitrary @xmath240 .",
    "for instance , consider the hilbert space @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are two finite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "the system of interest decomposed into two subsystems : the left subsystem , described by @xmath244 , and the right subsystem , described by @xmath245 .",
    "let the von neumann algebra @xmath25 be @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the identity operator on @xmath245 . as we have seen in the above , for any measurement with local symmetry with respect to the group @xmath82",
    "the statistics of outcomes of the measurement on state @xmath240 is exactly the same as the statistics of the outcomes of that measurement on state @xmath242 .",
    "but for any state @xmath248 , it holds that @xmath249 . in other words",
    ", this means that if before a measurement @xmath7 with local symmetry with respect to @xmath82 , we discard all the @xmath0 right subsystems , we still can simulate the measurement @xmath7 by performing a measurement on the left subsystems .",
    "so , effectively the hilbert space which is relevant in this problem is @xmath244 which is of a smaller size than the hilbert space @xmath208 .",
    "this clearly put an upper bound on the amount of entanglement required to implement measurement @xmath7 .",
    "we can extend this argument to the case of an arbitrary von neumann algebra @xmath25 .",
    "a particularly important case is where @xmath25 is a commutative algebra . in this case , for any arbitrary state @xmath250 , the state @xmath242 , as an element of @xmath138 , commutes with all generators of @xmath138 .",
    "so if on each individual subsystem we measure an observable ( projective von - neumann measurement ) inside the algebra @xmath25 we will not change the state @xmath242 .",
    "but since @xmath251 , we can uniquely specify @xmath242 by measuring a set of observables in @xmath25 which generates the algebra @xmath25 on each individual subsystem ( note that generators of @xmath25 all commute with each other and so can be measured simultaneously ) .",
    "however , after these measurements we know the exact description of state @xmath242 and so we can then simulate any other measurement by a post - processing of the data we have gathered in these measurements .",
    "finally , we notice that measuring generators of @xmath25 on each individual subsystem for state @xmath242 gives exactly the same statistics as measuring these generators on the original state @xmath240 .",
    "so we can summarize this discussion as follows .",
    "( * commutative algebras*)[lem : com ] let @xmath82 be the gauge group of the commutative von neumann algebra @xmath79 .",
    "then any measurement on @xmath54 which has local symmetry with respect to @xmath82 can be realized by measuring a set of observables which generate @xmath25 on each system individually followed by a classical processing of the outcomes .    therefore to implement a measurement which has local symmetry with respect to the gauge group @xmath82 of a commutative algebra @xmath25",
    "one does not need any entanglement or adaptive measurement .",
    "having studied the consequences of local symmetry for measurements , we now show how the result of previous section and in particular theorem [ pro - map - s ] implies that for states whose support is restricted to the symmetric / anti - symmetric subspace , the global symmetry of a measurement with respect to a gauge group can be promoted to a local symmetry .",

    "bob s goal is to estimate some parameter(s ) of state @xmath240 .",

    "the entire strategy , which combines the measurement and the data processing , can be described by a povm @xmath252 .",

    "therefore , the most general figure of merit which evaluates the performance of different strategies in an estimation problem is a function which assigns real numbers to all povms @xmath252 .",
    "equivalently , in the case of the multi - copy estimation problems we are considering here , the most general figure of merit can be described as a real functional which acts on the two variable function @xmath303 the conditional probability that , using the strategy described by povm @xmath252 , the event @xmath236 happens given that alice has chosen the state @xmath304 and has sent state @xmath305 to bob through the channel @xmath255 ( here , @xmath306 denotes the support of the distribution @xmath301 ) .",
    "this describes the most general figure of merit one can define for the multi - copy estimation problems we are considering here .",
    "however , in the particular cases where for example the goal is to estimate some parameter of @xmath240 , say the expectation value of some observable for state @xmath240 , one might use a figure of merit which only depends on the conditional probability of outcomes for different values of that parameter . here , we think of the parameter as a random variable defined as a function of the state alice chooses each time ( the state is random and so any function of the state can be thought of as a random variable ) .",
    "let @xmath307 be an arbitrary function from states in @xmath306 to real numbers .",

    "then if bob s goal is to estimate the value of parameter @xmath309 for the state @xmath240 which alice has chosen each time ( or to make a decision based on the value of this parameter ) a reasonable family of figures of merit to evaluate bob s performance can be expressed as functionals of @xmath310 where @xmath311 is an interval of @xmath312 .",
    "this is the conditional probability that , using the strategy described by povm @xmath313 , event @xmath235 happens given that the value of the random variable @xmath314 is in @xmath311 .",

    "for instance , one may imagine situations where the cost of wrong estimation of a parameter @xmath315 depends also on the energy of state @xmath318 where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian .",
    "so in this case @xmath319 defines a relevant parameter to evaluate the performance of the estimation procedure . in general , let @xmath320 be a set of functions where each @xmath321 is a function from @xmath306 to @xmath312 . then based on the set of functions @xmath320 we can define a set of random variables @xmath322 where the random variable @xmath323 is @xmath324 where @xmath240 is the random state alice has chosen at each round .",

    "note that by having larger number of parameters @xmath327 we can describe more and more general types of figure of merit .",
    "in general , if @xmath331 is the dimension of @xmath332 then the set of all ( normalized ) density operators can be specified by @xmath333 parameters . so having @xmath334 parameters is sufficient to specify the exact density operator alice has chosen each time , and so @xmath334 parameters are sufficient to describe the most general form of figures of merit one can imagine for this problem ( one can think of matrix elements of a density operator in a particular basis as different parameters ) .",
    "however , generally , having a figure of merit which can be defined using less than @xmath335 parameters , makes it easier to find the optimal estimation procedure .    to summarize , in the multi - copy estimation problem we are considering here , @xmath336 has the maximal information required to evaluate the figure of merit of the strategy described by the povm @xmath7 . in other words , if for two different strateges described by povms @xmath313 and @xmath337 it holds that @xmath338 for all @xmath236 and @xmath339 then they will have exactly the same performance in the estimation problem with respect to any figure of merit .",

    "first note that @xmath646 which together with eq.([app : comm ] ) implies that @xmath647\\pi_{\\pm } = 0 $ ] .",
    "this together with eq.([sup : phi+ ] ) and definition of @xmath185 implies @xmath648 which is the third claim of theorem  [ pro - map - s ] .",
    "furthermore since the image of @xmath639 is in the permutationally invariant subalgebra of @xmath138 and since @xmath25 , being a von - neumann algebra , includes identity , it follows that @xmath649 is in the permutationally invariant subalgebra of @xmath138 .",
    "this implies that the image of @xmath650 is in this subalgebra , which is the second claim of theorem  [ pro - map - s ] .",
    "furthermore , noting that @xmath651 is completely positive and the @xmath652 s are all positive numbers we can conclude that @xmath639 as a combination of completely positive maps is completely positive .",
    "this together with the fact that @xmath649 is a projector ( and so a positive operator ) implies that @xmath185 is completely positive .",
    "finally , it is straightforward to verify that @xmath653 , so that it is unital which proves the first claim of theorem  [ pro - map - s ] .",
    "we demonstrate here that a group that does not have the gauge property does not yield a dual reductive pair in the manner specified by theorems  [ cor - pairs ] and [ thm - sym ] .",
    "that is , we present an example for a non - gauge group @xmath654 for which the commutant of the algebra spanned by @xmath57 in @xmath62 is larger than the algebra spanned by @xmath655 .",
    "( recall that for any group @xmath123 it always holds that @xmath656 ) .    as a simple example , consider @xmath294 , @xmath657 where the group @xmath8 is the @xmath221 irreducible representation of @xmath222 which is a subgroup of @xmath658 .",
    "this group is not a gauge group : schur s lemma implies that @xmath659 where @xmath660 $ ] and @xmath23 is identity on @xmath223 and so @xmath661 .",
    "so @xmath662 where @xmath476 and @xmath663 are respectively the projectors to the symmetric and anti - symmetric subspace of @xmath664 .",
    "on the other hand , one can easily see that @xmath219 , the algebra of operators commuting with @xmath57 , is @xmath665 where @xmath666 is the projector to the subspace of @xmath664 with total angular momentum @xmath667 .",
    "therefore the algebra of operators commuting with @xmath57 is larger than @xmath668 .",
    "here , we show that the restriction to the symmetric and anti - symmetric subspaces plays an essential role in theorem [ thm - sym ] and the other results of section [ sec : restric ] . recall",
    "that theorem [ thm - sym ] implies that for symmetric and anti - symmetric subspaces of @xmath54 , denoted by @xmath669_{\\pm}$ ] , and for any gauge group @xmath670 it holds that @xmath671 clearly for any other irrep @xmath196 of @xmath58 it holds that @xmath672 where by @xmath673 we mean the commutant of @xmath674_{\\lambda})$ ] in @xmath675_{\\lambda})$ ] .",
    "however , for arbitrary @xmath196 , @xmath673 is not necessarily invariant under permutation , while @xmath676 is always permutationally invariant .",
    "so , as we discussed in section [ sec : restric ] a natural generalization of theorem [ thm - sym ] will be @xmath677 where @xmath678 is the projector to the subspace of @xmath54 which carries irrep @xmath196 of @xmath3 . from theorem [ thm - sym ]",
    "we know that for the special case of 1-d representations of @xmath3 , i.e. for symmetric and anti - symmetric subspaces , the above equality hold . here",
    ", we build an explicit counter - example to this equality for other irreps of @xmath3 .",
    "first , notice that the action of @xmath118 , @xmath156 and @xmath67 on @xmath54 all commute with each other .",
    "this implies that for irrep @xmath196 of @xmath58 the subspace @xmath679_{\\lambda}$ ] can be decomposed as @xmath680_{\\lambda}\\cong\\left(\\bigoplus_{\\mu,\\nu } \\mathcal{m}_{\\mu}\\otimes\\mathcal{n}_{\\nu}\\otimes   \\mathbb{c}^{m_{\\mu,\\nu } } \\right)\\otimes\\mathcal{k}_{\\lambda}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 labels irreps of @xmath4 and @xmath48 labels irreps of @xmath5 and @xmath118 , @xmath156 and @xmath67 act nontrivially only on @xmath681 , @xmath682 and @xmath683 respectively .",
    "note that any permutationally invariant operator should be proportional to identity on the subsystem @xmath683 .",
    "now to build the counterexample we find two gauge groups @xmath4 and @xmath5 for which there is no one - to - one relation between the irreps of @xmath4 and @xmath5 which show up in @xmath684_{\\lambda}$ ] . in other words ,",
    "we find an example in which there is some irrep @xmath47 of @xmath4 for which @xmath49 is nonzero for more than one @xmath48 ( irrep of @xmath5 )",
    ". this in turn will imply that there exist permutationally invariant operators @xmath198 which commute with @xmath200 but are not block diagonal between @xmath685 and @xmath686 for two different irrep @xmath687 and @xmath688 of @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that @xmath198 can not be in @xmath676",
    ".    note that from theorem [ thm - sym ] we know that in the specific case where irrep @xmath196 is a 1-d representations of @xmath58 the conjecture holds .",
    "so to find a counter - example we need to look at @xmath689 where the permutation group can have representations other than the symmetric and anti - symmetric . in the following , we present a counter - example in the case of @xmath690 .",
    "in this case the permutation group @xmath691 has a two dimensional irrep denoted by @xmath692 .",
    "consider the hilbert space @xmath693 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are both isomorphic to @xmath206 .",
    "suppose @xmath694 , i.e. the group of all unitaries which act trivially on @xmath245 .",
    "clearly @xmath5 is the set of all unitaries acting trivially on @xmath244 and so @xmath695 .",
    "note that both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are isomorphic to @xmath99 .",
    "so rather than talking about irreps of @xmath4 and @xmath5 we will talk about irreps of @xmath99 .",
    "using decomposition @xmath696 we can think of the collective representation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 on @xmath697 as @xmath698 and @xmath699 respectively where @xmath700 can be thought as the collective representation of @xmath99 on @xmath701 and @xmath702 is the identity operator on @xmath701 .",
    "similarly we can think of the canonical representation of @xmath691 on @xmath697 as @xmath703 where @xmath704 and @xmath705 are the canonical representation of @xmath691 on @xmath706 and @xmath707 respectively .    now according to schur - weyl duality",
    "there is a one to one relation between the irreps of @xmath99 which show up in representation @xmath700 on @xmath708 and irreps of @xmath691 which show up in representation @xmath709 on @xmath708 .",

    "to see this consider the total hilbert space @xmath720_{{+ } } \\otimes \\left[\\mathcal{h}_{r}^{\\otimes 3}\\right]_{{+ } } \\right ) \\\\",
    "\\oplus&\\left(\\left[\\mathcal{h}_{l}^{\\otimes 3}\\right]_{{\\lambda_{2 } } } \\otimes \\left[\\mathcal{h}_{r}^{\\otimes 3}\\right]_{{+}}\\right ) \\oplus \\left(\\left[\\mathcal{h}_{l}^{\\otimes 3}\\right]_{{+ } } \\otimes   \\left[\\mathcal{h}_{r}^{\\otimes 3}\\right]_{{\\lambda_{2}}}\\right)\\\\   \\oplus&\\left(\\left[\\mathcal{h}_{l}^{\\otimes 3}\\right]_{{\\lambda_{2 } } } \\otimes \\left[\\mathcal{h}_{r}^{\\otimes 3}\\right]_{{\\lambda_{2}}}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath67 the canonical representation of @xmath691 on it .",

    "therefore , this example is a counter - example to the above conjecture .",
    "here , we present two examples of common figures of merits and we show that they can be accommodated within our framework .",
    "suppose that @xmath393 is a vector of parameters to be estimated .",
    "as described earlier , any estimation scheme , consisting of a choice of measurement and a post - processing of its outcome , can be described by a povm @xmath313 . in this case",
    ", the outcome space @xmath231 must correspond to the range of @xmath347 .",
    "the probability of obtaining an estimate @xmath725 of @xmath393 in the @xmath327-dimensional interval @xmath457 is @xmath726 we will assume that it is possible to express this in terms of a probability _ density _ function @xmath727 , defined by @xmath728 now suppose that the performance of the estimation scheme will be judged by a cost function ( we follow ref .",
    "the most basic case would be a function of the form @xmath729 , which represents the cost of estimating @xmath725 when the true value of the parameters is @xmath393 . more generally , however , the cost may depend on more than just the value of the parameters to be estimated .",
    "therefore , some subset of the elements of @xmath393 might not be included among the parameters to be estimated , being only required to compute the cost , as discussed earlier in this section .",
    "the joint probability density for the state being @xmath240 and the estimation strategy @xmath7 yielding @xmath725 is clearly @xmath732 given the definition of the vector of parameters @xmath393 , one can compute from @xmath733 the joint probability density for the vector of parameters having value @xmath734 and the estimation strategy @xmath7 yielding @xmath725 , denoted @xmath735 . defining @xmath736 as the marginal on @xmath329 of this joint density",
    ", it is always possible to decompose the joint density as @xmath737 it follows that the expected cost can be written as @xmath738 this figure of merit is clearly a functional of @xmath739 .",
    "because this can be defined in terms of the probability measure @xmath740 , the figure of merit can be considered a functional of the latter and hence the condition of corollary  [ corollary : main ] applies .",
    "it follows that if the problem has gauge symmetry @xmath82 and satisfies the assumptions of theorem  [ thm - main - generalized ] ( or theorem  [ thm - main - chann ] ) , then the optimal estimation can be achieved with povms restricted to @xmath138 .      the framework for estimation that we have proposed can contend with cases that are more general than those wherein the figure of merit is a cost function . a common figure of merit is the _ mutual information _ between the actual and guessed values of the parameters to be estimated . here",
    ", we show that this can also be accommodated within our framework .",
    "note first that the probability density for the actual value being @xmath741 and the guessed value being @xmath725 given estimation strategy @xmath7 is defined in eq .  .",
