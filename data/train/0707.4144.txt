    "ceaseless efforts for accuracy improvement and constant progress in computing technology have made the pencil - beam ( pb ) algorithm be the standard method for dose distribution calculation in heavy charged particle radiotherapy with protons and heavier ions.@xcite in the pb algorithm , a treatment beam is divided into elementary pencil beams with developing transverse spread as they penetrate through heterogeneous medium to handle spatial modulation of beam scatter that is ignored in the broad - beam ( bb ) algorithm.@xcite the dose distribution will be formed with superposition of the pencil beams using kernel - convolution techniques with variations in algorithmic implementation , for example , in choice of the coordinate system , order of the multiple integrals , and numerical approximations , which greatly influence the accuracy , speed , complexity , and generality of the code.@xcite    though the pb algorithm may be sufficiently accurate and fast for dose calculation in treatment planning in the present form , demand for faster calculation methods may always remain , for example , for optimization in the intensity - modulated radiotherapy with scanned charged particle beams,@xcite and for adaptive radiotherapy under image guidance,@xcite which will ultimately accommodate on - site re - planning for an immobilized patient quickly between imaging and treatment .",

    "show the point - spreading functions with projected transverse spread of @xmath85 mm at the bragg peak , where the spreading in the analytic model is confined in the transverse plane and that in the gds algorithm forms an ellipsoidal volume .",
    "in other words , the planar spreading is approximately resolved into the three uncorrelated orthogonal spreading by @xmath86 mm , @xmath87 mm , and @xmath88 mm , which has deformed the point - spreading function , or the point kernel , and consequently the dose distribution .",
    "the pb algorithms superpose the dose distributions from the pencil beams in the field , where time - consuming ray - tracing integrals will severely slow down the calculation if performed within the convolution .",
    "the algorithmic implementation from the interaction point of view,@xcite where multiple dose depositions are associated with each terma emission , may minimize the ray - tracing integrals .",
    "however , the dose transfer to the nearby dose grids involves relatively complicated coordinate transformations within the convolution , which may be still substantially time consuming.@xcite    in the gds algorithm , the superposition is done in the terma space rather than in the dose space , the ray - tracing integrals are completely decoupled from the convolution , and the geometrical emitter ",

    "the terma distribution is calculated as an intermediate quantity with grid quantization errors , which will propagate to the dose distribution . however",
    ", the quantization error will be usually negligible with sufficiently fine grid spacing .",

    "when the beam is angled to all the three grid axes , the transverse planar spreading is approximated by volumetric spreading that includes an artifactual longitudinal component .",
    "the longitudinal spread @xmath92 and the transverse spread @xmath90 of the deformed kernel are derived from reprojection and conservation of the spread squared , @xmath93 which are a measure of inaccuracy in distal fall off and a measure of accuracy in lateral penumbra , respectively , and will be both @xmath94 in the worst case with direction @xmath95 .",
    "figure [ fig_3 ] shows the reprojected spreads as a function of gantry angle @xmath91 in coplanar beam arrangement with @xmath96 , which explains the deformation of the proton pencil beam at @xmath97 in sec .",
    "[ iii.b ] .",
    "the spread of a pristine pencil beam limits the granularity of the dose distribution and may naturally approximate the necessary and sufficient spatial resolution for beam control and dose evaluation . the finer structure below the resolution and the various spatial uncertainties are normally tolerated with appropriate margins . in fact",
    ", the ptv should include substantial margins against patient setup error and internal organ motion of typically a few to several millimeters,@xcite for example 5 to 10 mm for the prostate in sec .",
    "[ iii.a ] . for clinical proton beams",
    ", the 20%80% penumbra size may grow as large as 10 mm,@xcite or @xmath98 mm , against which , a field margin of @xmath99 mm around the ptv is usually added .",
    "then , even with the worst direction @xmath95 , the artifact as large as @xmath100 mm will be mostly covered up by those margins .    generally for broad beams , the systematic deformation of the kernels uniformly distributed in the field will be mostly compensated except for field edges in analogy to the kernel - tilting approximation for photon beams.@xcite the spread and hence the deformation will be even smaller with heavier - ion beams .",
    "in addition , when a vertical or horizontal coplanar beam is used in conjunction with planning ct in treatment position , namely with @xmath91 = 0 or 90 in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] , the artifact will be completely absent , which has been almost always the case in carbon - ion radiotherapy with himac and will be as well with its planned successors.@xcite    there are also other sources of inaccuracy in the pb model,@xcite as well as ones in real clinical systems such as uncertainties in patient modeling , patient setup , organ motion , physiological variation , and beam control .",
    "since there are always requirements for practicalness in treatment planning , accuracy is important but not the absolute measure of dose calculation and should be assessed in a relative manner .",
    "the implementation of the gds algorithm to the treatment planning system hiplan should have proved its simplicity , effectiveness , usability , and robustness necessary for dose distribution calculation in treatment planning practice and may also indicate possibilities for broader applications in the future .",
    "for example , the framework for the single pencil beam in sec .",
    "[ ii.e ] can be extended to scanned beams , where the pencil beams are dynamically modulated in intensity , position , range , and spread.@xcite the instantaneous pencil beam , or spot beam @xmath39 , is characterized by dose - per - fluence - per - incident - particle distribution @xmath101 , number of incident particles @xmath102 , and transverse spread @xmath103 at grid @xmath25 .",
    "the effective terma @xmath73 and the effective transverse spread @xmath104 at grid @xmath25 are calculated by dose - weighted superposition of the spot beams , @xmath105 where parameter @xmath106 is the distance along spot beam @xmath39 and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the distances to enter and to exit from the grid-@xmath25 voxel . these gridded distributions will be calculated efficiently from the interaction point of view,@xcite for the gds algorithm in sec .",
    "[ ii.c ] . in other words , in the gds algorithm , summation of the pencil beams per field is efficiently made in the terma and spread spaces and then a single volumetric convolution is also efficiently applied to form the dose distribution .    application to intensity - modulated particle - beam therapy to achieve uniform target dose with multidirectional nonuniform fields,@xcite however , requires some caution because the kernel deformation of the gds algorithm is orientation dependent and , thus , will not be compensated in the summed plan - dose distribution even in the middle of the treated volume .",
    "appropriateness of the beam modulation will have to be assessed , or otherwise compromised , to be less sensitive to not only the kernel deformation but also all the other uncertainties involved in the real clinical system.@xcite",
    "a new variant of the pb algorithm , the gds algorithm , is proposed for heavy charged particle radiotherapy with approximations of the gridded intermediate distributions and a modified convolution kernel for grid - to - grid energy transfer .",
    "the resultant high - speed nature and easiness of implementation are distinctive features of the gds algorithm .",
    "when the beam incidence is angled to all the dose - grid axes , the approximation will cause deformation in dose distribution within the size of the pristine spread .",
