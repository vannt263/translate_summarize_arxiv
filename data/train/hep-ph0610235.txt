    "transport coefficients are measures of the efficiency at which a conserved quantity is transported on `` long '' distances ( compared to microscopic relaxation scales ) in a medium . for example",
    ", electrical conductivity characterizes the diffusion of charge due to an external electric field and shear viscosity characterizes the diffusion of momentum transverse to the direction of propagation . in real non - relativistic systems ( e.g. interacting electron gas in a lattice ) , transport coefficients are almost impossible to calculate , because systems are strongly interacting and no simple closure exists ; but in hot , weakly interacting theories , they can in principle be evaluated . the computation of these quantities is important from a theoretical point of view : since they characterize linear deviations away from equilibrium but are computed from well - known equilibrium field theory tools , they could be used as a benchmark for testing non - equilibrium field theories , which are less well developed than equilibrium ones ( but see the recent developments in refs .",
    "they could also have an influence on the physics of the early universe , such as electroweak baryogenesis ( see for example @xcite ) and the formation and decay of primordial magnetic fields ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "shear viscosity also attracted a lot of attention lately in the heavy ion community , partly due to the results on elliptic flow ( seemingly implying a low viscosity , see for example @xcite and the references therein ) and its exact computation in a strongly coupled super yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the above examples show the importance of having a good theoretical handle on transport coefficients .    the first calculation of transport coefficients in relativistic scalar theories can be found in @xcite .",
    "their calculation is based on kubo relations , _",
    "i.e. _ relations expressing transport coefficients in terms of retarded correlation functions between various conserved currents in the low momentum , low frequency limit .",
    "the correlation functions are directly evaluated using finite temperature quantum field theory and thus provide a microscopic calculation of transport coefficients ; but as is explained in @xcite , their calculation is incomplete . due to the use of resummed propagators ( to regularize so - called pinch singularities ) ,",
    "an infinite number of ladder diagrams must be resummed to get the leading order result .",
    "this program has been carried out explicitly in @xcite for shear and bulk viscosities in scalar theories .",
    "the shear viscosity result has since been reproduced using the real - time formalism @xcite , direct ladder summation in euclidean space @xcite and 2pi effective action methods @xcite .",
    "the results of both shear and bulk viscosities have been reproduced using quantum kinetic field theory derived from the closed - time - path 2pi effective action @xcite .",
    "order of magnitude estimates of transport coefficients in gauge theories based on phenomenology appeared more than 20 years ago in @xcite , but a complete leading order calculation in hot gauge theories just came out recently @xcite .",
    "one of the main reason for this is the subtlety of the power counting involved , _",
    "i.e. _ which scattering processes should be included at leading order . in gauge theories ,",
    "in addition to @xmath0 scatterings with a soft momentum exchange , the presence of collinear singularities makes the @xmath1 scatterings as important as the @xmath0 ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , interference effects between the various collinear emissions must also be taken into account at leading order ; this is called the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite . the calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite are based on kinetic theory and consistently include the physics of pinch singularities , collinear singularities and the lpm effect .",
    "let us mention that these calculations are also very involved technically , since the inclusion of pinch singularities implies the use of an integral equation and the inclusion of collinear singularities and the lpm effect implies the use of another integral equation embedded in the first one .",
    "the equivalence between the quantum field theory approach and the kinetic theory approach in transport coefficients calculations was shown in @xcite in the case of scalar theories ; but due to the complications mentioned previously , a similar equivalence has been lacking in gauge theories .",
    "there exist some attempts at computing transport coefficients in hot gauge theories from quantum field theory using different approaches , such as direct ladder summation in euclidean space @xcite , dynamical renormalization group methods @xcite and 2pi effective action methods @xcite , but as far as we know , none of these approaches go beyond leading log order accuracy ( _ i.e. _ with corrections suppressed by @xmath2 ) or the large @xmath3 approximation .    the goal of this paper is to do a leading order calculation of transport coefficients in hot gauge theories using purely diagrammatic methods .",
    "more precisely , we show the equivalence between quantum field theory and kinetic theory for transport coefficient calculations in hot gauge theories , thus justifying the effective kinetic theory results of arnold , moore and yaffe @xcite from first principles .",
    "this nontrivial check is reason enough for doing this calculation , but there are other reasons as well that go beyond kinetic theory .",
    "for example , in cases where the configuration of the field itself is important ( e.g. instanton ) or unphysical particles with indefinite metric appear , then kinetic theory is inappropriate and one must rely on quantum field theory .",
    "also , quantum field theory might be the only way of computing transport coefficients beyond leading order ; according to @xcite , doing the calculation using kinetic theory would require a whole new machinery .",
    "it is not clear if calculations going beyond leading order can be converted to a linearized boltzmann equation . finally , showing that the calculations are grounded and feasible in quantum field theory is important in itself .",
    "it could give the necessary impetus for other quantum field theory methods ( e.g. closed - time - path 2pi effective action @xcite or the dynamical renormalization group @xcite ) to complete a leading order calculation and provide other insights into the problem .",
    "in view of the applications mentioned previously , we think it is interesting and important to pursue this work .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and electrical conductivity ; we address the case of shear viscosity in a future paper @xcite .",

    "the cutting rules we use are the ones that can be found in @xcite and are analogous to the zero - temperature ones .",
    "the rules are :    1 .",
    "draw all the cut diagrams relevant to the problem considered , where cuts separate the unshaded ( _ i.e. _ `` 1 '' ) and the shaded ( _ i.e. _ `` 2 '' ) regions .",

    "if the momentum of a cut line crosses from the unshaded to the shaded region , assign @xmath52 .",
    "if the momentum of a cut line crosses from the shaded to the unshaded region , assign @xmath53 .",
    "4 .   divide by the appropriate symmetry factor and multiply by an overall factor of @xmath54 .",
    "the various shadings given by the cutting rules are not all independent .",
    "first , the `` vanishing of all circlings '' relation @xcite says that the sum of all possible cuts of a given diagram is zero : @xmath55 equation  ( [ eq : unitarity ] ) can be rearranged so as to have the same form as a ( generalized ) optical theorem and is thus related to unitarity .",
    "the vanishing of all circlings relation is only based on the observation that all propagators can be decomposed into a positive frequency part and a negative frequency part .",
    "second , the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) relations express the proportionality between various pairs of shadings .",
    "for example , for 2-point functions we have @xcite : @xmath56 for 4-point functions , the relations are @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the inverse temperature and energy - momentum requires @xmath59 .",
    "the relations  ( [ eq : kms_2pt_function])-([eq : kms_4pt_function ] ) are only based on the ( anti ) periodicity in imaginary times of the green s functions and are thus only valid in equilibrium .      a natural starting point for evaluating transport coefficients using quantum field theory",
    "is a kubo type relation .",
    "these relations express transport coefficients in terms of long distance correlations between conserved currents . restricting ourselves to electrical conductivity ( @xmath60 ) , we have @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the electric current density .",
    "other kubo relations exist for shear and bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "equivalently , one can express these kubo relations in terms of derivatives of the spectral density , itself equal to twice the imaginary part of the corresponding retarded correlator .",
    "note that the averages are done with respect to an equilibrium density matrix , even though transport coefficients are non - equilibrium quantities .    to compute transport coefficients using these relations",
    ", one needs to expand the retarded 2-point function perturbatively . as explained in details in refs .",
    "@xcite , an infinite number of ladder diagrams contribute to the transport coefficient , even at lowest order .",
    "the reason for this is the low frequency limit in the kubo relation .",
    "this limit gives rise to products of propagators @xmath63 with the same momentum ( see fig .  [ fig : ladder_diagrams ] ) .",
    "since finite temperature propagators possess four poles ( one in each quadrant ) , one faces situations when the integration contour is `` pinched '' between two poles on opposite sides of the real axis in the complex @xmath64 plane . in equations",
    ", we have ( @xmath65 is the on - shell quasi - particle energy ) :    @xmath66    which diverges when @xmath67 goes to zero .",
    "this divergence is symptomatic of the infinite lifetime of the excitation . in a medium",
    ", excitations constantly suffer collisions from on - shell excitations coming from the thermal bath , resulting in a finite lifetime .",
    "thus , the use of resummed propagators regularizes these `` pinch '' singularities , effectively replacing @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "the explicit coupling constants that now appear in the denominator change the power counting dramatically and make the resummation of an infinite number of ladder diagrams necessary @xcite .",
    "this resummation is done by re - writing the infinite sum of ladder diagrams in terms of an effective vertex , itself solution to an integral equation .",
    "schematically , we have for electrical conductivity : @xmath70    @xmath71    where @xmath72 .",

    "the symbol @xmath73 represents a pair of `` side rail '' propagators ( note that the `` ladder '' diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : integral_equation ] is on its side , meaning that the `` side rails '' are on the top and bottom of the diagram ) . in the limit @xmath74 , the two side rail propagators that hook up @xmath75 to @xmath76 have the same momentum and `` pinch '' , producing a @xmath77 factor .",
    "the `` rungs '' @xmath75 are 4-point functions that must be of the same order as @xmath78 but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the effective vertex @xmath79 encodes the information about the infinite resummation of ladder diagrams .",
    "if we close it with an external current insertion @xmath80 ( with an additional factor of @xmath73 to connect them ) , we get the kubo relation  ( [ eq : kubo_relation_schematic ] ) . note that",
    "because of the @xmath73 factor , the transport coefficient gets a non - analytic behavior in the coupling constant .",
    "this is expected , since transport coefficients are roughly proportional to the mean free path and thus inversely proportional to the scattering cross section of the processes responsible for transport .    to write down the appropriate integral equation  ( [ eq : integral_equation_schematic ] ) and solve it are the main tasks of transport coefficient calculations .",
    "altough it can become very involved numerically ( especially for gauge theories ) , there is no conceptual problem with solving the integral equation . on the other hand ,",
    "to know which rungs contribute at leading order is difficult and requires detailed power counting arguments .",
    "this is the approach adopted in @xcite , where they find that a certain ( finite ) set of rungs are necessary and sufficient to compute the shear and bulk viscosities at leading order in a @xmath81 theory .",
    "gauge theories are considered to be the most successful theories on the market to describe the fundamental interactions of nature .",
    "so for `` real '' applications ( e.g. viscous hydrodynamic evolution of the qgp ) , the need to extend transport coefficient calculations to gauge theories is obvious .",
    "from experience , we know that gauge theories are more complicated than scalar theories , and the present calculations are no exceptions .",
    "we make a list of the main complications that arise when computing transport coefficients in hot gauge theories .",
    "preserving gauge invariance is an important problem when dealing with gauge theories . in practice ,",
    "ward identities tell us how non - gauge invariant quantities ( such as propagators and vertices ) must be related to each other so as to preserve gauge invariance .",
    "we show in sect .",
    "[ sec : ward_identity ] how ward identities are used to this effect .",
    "another complication , not specific to gauge theories , is related to the presence of different species of particles ( electrons , photons , etc ) and particles with different statistics .",
    "the fact that there are fermions in the theory means that the tools developed in @xcite must be slightly modified to take into account the fermionic nature of the particles .",
    "these complications are not major and rather technical in nature .",
    "we show in sect .",
    "[ sec : integral_equations ] how the tools in @xcite must be modified in the presence of these complications .",
    "the distinction between hard ( @xmath82 ) and soft ( @xmath83 ) momenta is also particularly important in hot gauge theories ( @xmath84 is the electromagnetic coupling constant ) . in particular",
    ", it is shown in @xcite that the theory must be partially resummed when soft momenta are present to get gauge invariant results . these hard thermal loop ( htl )",
    "resummations give rise to screening thermal masses and modify the form of the propagators ( vertices are also modified but this not necessary for our purposes ) . for numerical purposes ( as in @xcite ) , the expressions of htl - resummed propagators are required . in the present paper ,",
    "our goal is to reproduce the boltzmann equation of arnold , moore and yaffe @xcite and we never use the explicit form of the propagators ; the calculations of sect .",
    "[ sec : integral_equations ] are based on very general properties that do not depend on htl resummation , such as even / odd properties of spectral densities , kms conditions and unitarity . in this sense",
    ", this technical complication does not concern us .",
    "but surely the most important complication comes from the fact that , in gauge theories , transport coefficients are sensitive to soft and collinear physics even at leading order @xcite . in scalar theories , explicit",
    "power counting shows that soft momenta and collinear singularities do not have any effect @xcite . as with pinch singularities ,",
    "collinear singularities come from the multiplication of two propagators with momenta @xmath85 and @xmath86 that are nearly collinear ( _ i.e. _ @xmath87 ) : @xmath88 in the limit @xmath89 ( pinch singularities ) , the expression diverges as @xmath68 and we get back eq .",
    "( [ eq : pinch_singularities ] ) . in the case where @xmath90 is nearly on - shell but nonzero and",
    "the angle between the quasi - particles is small ( _ i.e. _ @xmath91 ) , we have @xmath92 and the integral diverges as @xmath93 ( or @xmath68 in the perfectly collinear and massless case ) . these collinear singularities must be regulated by including a finite width in the propagators . as with the pinch singularity case",
    ", the introduction of coupling constants in the denominator changes the power counting dramatically .",
    "this collinear enhancement affects an infinite class of diagrams : this is the well - known lpm effect ( see for example @xcite for a discussion of this effect in the context of photon production ) .",
    "because there are now two types of singularities , there are two resummations to do . while in scalar theories there is an infinite number of ladder diagrams and a finite number of different rung types , in gauge theories there are an infinite number of ladder diagrams ( due to pinch singularities ) and an infinite number of different rung types ( due to collinear singularities ) .",
    "we come back to these issues and the subtleties of power counting in gauge theories in sect .",
    "[ sec : power_counting ] .",
    "as mentioned in sect .  [ sec : complications ] , the task of finding which rungs contribute at leading order is not easy .",
    "the purpose of the present section and the next one is to show that there exists a guiding principle that can help us find the structure of the rungs .",
    "a necessary piece of information in our demonstration is the ward identity for the effective vertex , as derived for the first time for the case of an electric current insertion in ref .",

    "the proper choice here is dictated by the physics of pinch singularities and the kubo relation . to have pinch singularities",
    ", one needs the multiplication of two propagators with different boundary conditions , namely @xmath97 or @xmath98 ; the kubo relation requires the evaluation of a retarded current - current 2-point function .",

    "note that it is possible to repeat the above derivation for a @xmath108 insertion @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important when calculating shear viscosity from kubo relations .      in this section ,",
