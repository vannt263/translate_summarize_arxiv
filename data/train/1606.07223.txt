    "open star clusters ( ocs ) or galactic open clusters are gravitationally bound system of stars formed together ( i.e. similar identified age ) and their stars are at practically the same distance with similar chemical composition whereas stars in a single cluster are differing only in mass @xcite . hence , they are dynamically associated system of stars which are formed from giant molecular clouds through bursts of star formation @xcite .",
    "the study of an individual star provides only limited , frequently inaccurate and uncertain information about it and possibly about the interstellar medium whereas , oscs provide an ideal opportunity to simultaneously study a group of stars located in a relatively small space @xcite . furthermore , it is believed that mostly stars in the galaxy are formed in open clusters @xcite , therefore , ocs are key probes for tracing the star - forming history ( sfh ) @xcite .",
    "such objects are excellent laboratories for studying the structure , kinematics and evolution of the galactic disc @xcite with chemical composition @xcite , consquently prescribed as the main building blocks of the stellar populations in our galaxy @xcite .",

    "furthermore , these systems are assigned solar orbits around the milky way centre @xcite .    beside these , many questions remain unanswered , such as the location of inner spiral arms or determination of the co - rotation distance @xcite .",
    "these ocs are studied to understand the space - age structure , formation and evolution of the galactic disk @xcite and the stellar evolution as well @xcite .",
    "they are believed important test beds for star formation , stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and stellar evolution theories @xcite .",

    "their study is of great interest and attractive work in several astrophysical aspects and verification of their evolution theories .",
    "the galactic , radial and vertical , abundance gradient can be studied by ocs @xcite .",
    "in addition , these objects are good tools to analyze the large - scale proprieties of the disk of our galaxy and testing tools of the theories of stellar and galactic evolution @xcite .",
    "hence , their observational studies have become a traditional benchmark for testing our comprehension of several aspects of the formation and properties of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "these studies are possible due to fact that their stars emerge from the same molecular cloud .",
    "the ocs have also provided constraints on the understanding of the step - like abrupt decrease in metallicity at 1 kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "a substantial number of ocs is hidden behind the interstellar material in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "researchers could be identified new clusters due to availability of data of huge infrared ( ir ) surveys and a low interstellar extinction in the ir wavelength range .",
    "this low value of extinction gives an opportunity to deeply dig into the spiral arm areas where most of the ocs are concentrated and more than a thousand ocs were discovered by analysing the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite .",
    "this survey has proven to be a powerful tool in the analysis of the structure and stellar content of ocs @xcite .",

    "the study of young clusters provide information about current star formation processes and are they also becomes key objects for describing questions about galactic structure , whereas observational studies of old and intermediate - age open clusters play an important role to study of theoretical evolution aspects of galaxy @xcite . the young ocs are effectively used to understand the nature of interactions between young stars and interstellar medium due to fact that they are still embedded in the parent nebulous regions @xcite .",

    "these regions has an important bearing on studies related to the mass function ( mf ) and the structure of ocs @xcite . a detailed structural analysis of coronae of ocs is needed to understand the effects of external environments , like the galactic tidal field and impulsive encounters with interstellar clouds , etc .",

    "the fundamental physical parameters of ocs , e.g. distance , reddening , age , and metallicity are play an important role to study about the galactic disk .",

    "the described diagrams of ocs usually show a well - defined long and broad main sequence ( ms ) @xcite .",
    "typically , the determination of basic parameters of ocs via isochrone fitting requires either that the metallicity is estimated , or that an priory value is adopted @xcite .",
    "therefore the metallicity becomes a required parameter for the precise determinating of parameters of the ocs .",
    "though , many times solar metallicity is often assumed due to the complexity of the required observations and requirement of very indirect methods for its determination @xcite .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy is often claimed to be the most accurate method for determining the metallicity value of clusters @xcite , though the value of metellacity of individual member of dense cluster could not be possible through present instruments due to their resolution powers .",
    "we also note that individual metallicity studies might well be able to achieve a high precision for a limited number of stars @xcite .",

    "dynamical evolution and mass segregation can have a significant effect on the radial structure as well as on the shape of the present - day mass function ( mf ) of open clusters .",
    "the mf of oc is usually obtained from the observed luminosity function ( lf ) , which can be obtained from the observed cmds @xcite .",
    "the universality of the imf of ocs is still an open question due to elementary considerations about the imf i.e. it depend on star - forming conditions @xcite .",

    "the difficulties such as complex corrections for stellar birth rates , life times , etc associated with determining the mass function ( mf ) from field stars are automatically avoided due to similar age and metaliicities of the members of ocs @xcite .",

    "the gravitational pull of the parent galaxy will disrupt the clusters and these objects present a snapshot of those stars , which have formed more or less at the same time and at the same place . as a result",
    ", these clusters are studied by the astronomers with the great interest .",
    "+ the theory of stellar structure and evolution within cluster is based on the mass dependent evolution of stellar luminosities and temperatures with age .",
    "the dating of young , embedded clusters is considerably more difficult due to the majority of pms stars in the embedded clusters and inaccuracy in the measurement of their luminosities and temperatures .",
    "the embedded - cluster phase of evolution lasts somewhere between 3 and 5 myr @xcite .",
    "other hand , the ms of older clusters terminates at fainter and cooler levels .",
    "the changes of the stars during the end of their lives may be constrains by differences observed among stars away from the ms .",
    "star formation processes is occurred in two modes as spontaneous star formation and triggered star formation .",
    "the tendency of the interstellar matter of galactic scale is to be condense under gravity into star - forming clouds , which is counteracted by galactic tidal forces .",
    "the star formation is take place for that dense cloud , for which , its self gravity to overcome these tidal forces . in the spontaneous star formation ( ssf ) , the huge molecular cloud convert into a protostar by falling inward towards a centre i.e. collapse process of said cloud .",
    "this prescribed collapse occurs due to the instability of huge cloud . in the earlier ssf theories",
    ", it was believed that it is the result of the gradual cooling of the warm interstellar gas , bringing the thermal jeans mass to a value lower than the mass of the cloud .",
    "a cold cloud may be born by turbulence or magnetic tension and pressure or rotation . moreover ,",
    "collapse of cold cloud occurs due to loses its turbulent energy via any dissipation mechanisms or loosing of magnetic field diffusion or disappearance of cloud s angular momentum due to magnetic tension .",
    "the matter accretion of cloud may be occurred due to the some combination of these three energies leads instability and mass change - without any loss of energy @xcite .",
    "a significant low mass stars are formed in molecular clouds in the vicinity of massive luminous stars @xcite .",
    "the interaction of @xmath4 radiation from @xmath5 stars with their surrounding molecular gas environments is necessary to study about star fromation processes and hydrodynamics of complex dynamic structures @xcite .",
    "this formation is take place due to the presence high pressure of gases .",
    "these mechanism is divided into three types , which are given as : ( i ) strong , ( ii ) moderate and ( iii ) weak triggering .",
    "a diffuse clouds is strike with a gravitational / radiation shock which leads stars formation through the compressed diffuse clouds .",
    "this phenomena is known to be * strong * triggering .",
    "such type star formation is not possible through the other alternating phenomena .",
    "the * moderate * triggering is increased the star formation rate in that molecular cloud region where stars already forms through the spontaneous star formation .",
    "thus , the shock increased the compression rate of gas in the * moderate * triggering which leads faster rate of star formation compare to the spontaneous star formation .",
    "the * weakly * triggering occurs due to the bulk motion of the gas , which leads varying star formation region with the bulk motion of the gas .",
    "furthermore , star formation rate remains constant in this triggering .",
    "+ triggering is also divided into three groups according to the size of star formation region / rate @xcite .",
    "the  small scale triggering involves the direct squeezing of pre - existing cloud or globules by high pressure ( nearly surrounds the whole cloud ) .",
    "an * intermediate scale triggering * is the compression of a cloud from one side .",
    "furthermore , a dense ridge of gas eventually collapses or recollects into denser cores in this triggering leads star formation .",
    "the * large scale triggering * is an accumulation of gas into an expanding shell or ring which partially surrounds the pressure source , a star or supernova",
    ". the all type of triggering may be result of a gravitational instability due to the density enhancement of a shock moving through a molecular cloud .",
    "recurrence of triggered star formation results in sequential star formation @xcite .",
    "these triggering processes are occurred due to the various external agents .",
    "the brief discussion of these agents are prescribed as below ,      the supernovae are those massive stars , in which explosions are occurred due to the stellar evolution .",
    "these explosions are giving rise to enormous amount of radiation to their surroundings leads to initiate star formation in nearby clouds by their supernovae - driven shock waves .",
    "numerical studies @xcite show that shock - waves with velocities in the range of @xmath6 corresponding to supernova explosions at a distance between 10 pc and 100 pc from the molecular cloud can induce such a collapse .",
    "massive stars emit very large amount of ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation .",
    "the surrounding gas region of these objects is ionized and heated due to the interaction of uv radiation . furthermore",
    ", such type regions are defined as the * h ii regions*. since , these regions are contained higher temperature",
    "(  @xmath7 k ) and higher pressure compare to its surrounding neutral hydrogen regions , therefore h ii region expands with a typical velocity of the order of  @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , its expansion rates decreases with time @xcite .",
    "h ii region may undergo with various events during the expansion @xcite .",
    "these events are given by various theories / models as follow : ( i ) radiation driven implosion i.e. rdi process @xcite , ( ii ) collect and collapse model @xcite , ( iii ) instability of ionization front , ( iv ) interaction between an h ii region and a nearby filamentary molecular cloud @xcite and ( v ) supersonic turbulent molecular medium @xcite .",
    "spiral arms of the galaxy are prominent regions of the ongoing star formation and fulfilled by the presence of young stars , h ii regions , dust and giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the said fulfilled matter within arms is the indication of the stars formation processes .",
    "the fixed angular speed of rotation of enhanced density regions of spiral arms is defined by the pattern speed and said regions are considered to be waves of compression , i.e. density waves @xcite .",
    "the speed of density waves is found to be high for the inner part of the galaxy with reference to the arms , whereas low for the outer part of said arms of the galaxy .",
    "a large cloud may sudden compressed due to its interaction with the spiral arm density leads increment of local mass density with the collapse of cloud @xcite .",
    "the large scale distribution of molecular clouds of spiral arms can be generated through the interaction between spiral shocks and cold atomic gas @xcite .",
    "since , the cluster parameters are highly depends on the observed photometric stellar magnitudes of a particular portion of the sky or field of view ( fov ) of the cluster region . the cluster existent may be probably understood through the crowding behaviour of the stars within the fov of the observed sky region .",
    "though , clusters are not having circular shape but it is assumed to be circular for determining the cluster radius in a simple way . a general discussion about determining procedure of the various spatial parameters of the cluster as given below ,      for determining the cluster radius , it is mandatory to determine the cluster center . it is assumed that the center of cluster is a that point in which the stellar density becomes maximum .",
    "the star count method @xcite is a best method for determining the center of any cluster .",
    "though it does not guaranteed fact that the point , having maximum most stellar number / density , shows exact cluster characteristics @xcite . in the case of above prescribed fact ,",
    "we would left maximum stellar point and the second maximum point would considered to be center of the cluster . as a result ,",
    "the finding procedure of the center becomes iterate procedure until the exact cluster characteristics does not appear .",
    "furthermore , the radial stellar densities are used to define the stellar crowding effect within the cluster instead of stellar number .",
    "the stellar densities are used to overcome the condition of blank / dark regions of the cluster .",
    "such blank / dark regions appear in the small portion of the cluster , however , such effect would be disappears in the case of large scale structure .",
    "this fact is well matched with the homogeneity property of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "+ the above prescribed radial densities are estimated within various radial zones . if , a total of @xmath9 stars are found within any radial zone ( having area @xmath10 ) then the radial density of that zone estimated by the relation as : @xmath11 . the width of radial zone may be kept in the manner that it does not affected cluster characteristics .",
    "the smaller width of the zone of any cluster produces highly varied densities values due to the presence of undefined dark / blank regions within the cluster .",
    "the high width of radial zone reduce the precision of estimation value of the cluster radius .",
    "furthermore , the said width of the radial zone changes according to the stellar density of the studied cluster .",
    "the smooth cluster characteristics may be obtain for low radial width of the dense cluster compare than the width of the sparse cluster . thus the resultant profile of radial stellar densities",
    "are played an important role to determine the cluster extant .",
    "the radial densities profile ( rdp ) of any cluster contains two axis .",
    "the x - axis represents the radial distance , whereas y - axis represents the radial densities .",
    "since , it is believed that the field stars are symmetrically distributed in the nearby sky of the cluster , therefore , the cluster region is contained the stellar enhancement with respect to the field region . on this background ,",
    "it is necessary to consider the field stellar density ( @xmath12 ) within the cluster .",
    "this said density must be reduced from the computed stellar densities of the various radial density .",
    "there are various statistical formulas to compute the radius of the cluster through these modal radial densities i.e. @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the observed stellar density of the @xmath15 radial zone ) . the most applied formula for estimating the center density ( @xmath16 ) and core radius ( @xmath17 ) of the cluster is king - empirical formula @xcite as given below , @xmath18 the said core radius of the cluster is defined as the radius where the density , @xmath19 , is half of the central density , @xmath16 @xcite . other hand ,",
    "the radius of the cluster is defined as the distance from the centre to the point where the stellar density of the cluster merged with the field region . since",
    ", it is noticeable fact that the best fitted curve of the king - empirical model and model background density i.e. @xmath12 , are never intercept to each other .",
    "since , this fact leads to an infinite extent of the cluster and produce a contradiction to compute the cluster extant , therefore the field stellar density is defined as the sum of 1-@xmath20 error with the @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the radius of the cluster is the distance from the center of the cluster to interception point between the best fitted curve and field stellar density .",
    "though , the 1-@xmath20 error is the statistical prediction for estimating the cluster radius and the resultant radius would be changed with significance level of the estimation such as 1-@xmath21 or 3-@xmath21 . on this background",
    ", the radius of the cluster is also estimated through the estimation error in background stellar density as follow , @xmath22 since , the above prescribed radius depends on the estimation error in the @xmath12 , therefore , it may be varied according to said estimation error .",
    "this error depends on the smoothness of the radial density profile , which further depends on the width of the assumed radial zone .",
    "the width of radial zone is selected by researcher on the behalf of his own sense .",
    "thus , resultant radius may not representing the true radius of the clusters .",
    "it is believed that the gravitational attraction among stars of the cluster is vanished beyond the cluster periphery , however it does not satisfied the reasons of sudden disappearing of attraction .",
    "though , the cluster members are shown the evaporating nature from the cluster region , so the disappearance of the said weakly gravitational bound may occurred before the end of extent of the cluster .",
    "thus , the gravitational bounding among stars of the cluster might not hold together in the adjacent stellar enhancement region of field region . as a result",
    ", it is needed to define a radial distance to describe the possible gravitational bounded region of the cluster and such region is defined by the limiting radius .",
    "this limiting radius is a radial distance , after which no stars are gravitationally bound to the cluster system @xcite .",
    "this said limiting radius is computed by the following relation @xcite , @xmath23 though , the estimation error of the field stellar density is also influenced the value of said radius , however computed value might to be reliable in the sense that the said value with uncertainty lies within the stellar enhancement region . on the basis of limiting radius , the maximum borderline background stellar density i.e. @xmath24 is estimated by the following relation , @xmath25 this limiting radius is also used to compute the concentration parameter ( @xmath26 ) following as @xcite , @xmath27 this relation is directly indication of positive value of @xmath26 for that stellar system , in which the limiting radius is greater than the core radius .",
    "furthermore , this parameter may be characterized the density profile of each cluster in such a way that it is independent of its diameter and richness .      besides above prescribed radii",
    ", we have found tidal radius of the cluster , which is computed through the total cluster mass ( @xmath28 ) as follow @xcite , @xmath29 here we have adopted a galactocentric distance @xmath30 and a milky way - like galaxy with an enclosed mass of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , the tidal radius is estimated using the relation given as @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the various limitation of rdps is described as below @xcite , + ( i ) the rdps is dependent on the limiting magnitudes of the detected stars .",
    "it seems that the cluster radius may be increased with the limiting magnitude of detected stars .",
    "+ ( ii ) in some cases , the weak contrast between cluster and field region in outer region creates inaccuracy for defining the angular size of the cluster .",
    "+ ( iii ) the exact cluster boundaries has not been defined due to the irregular shape of the cluster .",
    "+ ( iv ) the identification procedure of the centre seems to be difficult for the sparse and poor cluster due to presence of clump in rdp .",
    "+ ( v ) the cluster members becomes diminishes with the increasing radial distance due to inability of detection them from the statistically fluctuation of the field stars .",
    "the surface number density @xmath33 is defined by the number of stars per magnitude interval in unit area .",
    "furthermore , it is a function of magnitude and radius from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "the sndps are very effective to estimate the cluster extent and the nature of stellar density within various magnitude bins @xcite .",
    "these profiles are highly effected due to the presence of data incompleteness and stellar crowding effect .",
    "furthermore , the characteristic curves of this profile are overlap to each other at the periphery of the cluster . as a result",
    ", these profiles are least used to determine the cluster extent . beside this , these profiles of clusters are the signature of stellar distribution of various masses leads the revolutionary information about the stellar evolution processes within the clusters .      generally , the cluster radius has estimated by considering the spherical shape of the cluster but cluster shape is non - spherical .",
    "this non - spherical shape is occurred due to the galactic tidal field @xcite , differential rotation of the galaxy , encounters with giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "thus , the semi - major ( _ a _ ) and semi - minor ( _ b _ ) axes of the apparent distribution of cluster members gives ellipticity @xmath34 following as , @xmath35 the semi - axes are considered to be the principal axes of an ellipse using characteristic equations for the second - order moments of tangential coordinates of the 1@xmath20 cluster members @xcite . however , this results may be influenced by the membership procedure of the cluster .",

    "pre - determined cluster members are used , therefore , the effect of field stars and spread stellar distribution is also demanded some attention .",
    "+ the determined distance and age of the cluster is also related with the metallicity .",
    "generally , the value of metallicity has been selected through the pre - consideration .",
    "there are no photometric technique for determining this .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of massive stars of the clusters are utilized to determine the metallicity of the cluster .",
    "such type spectroscopic observations of the clusters are very limited and also the the spectroscopic study of the very fainter members are not available . on this background ,",
    "the accurate measurement of the metallicity of the cluster is not available at the present .",
    "since , the known cluster parameters depend on the pre - assumed metallicity of the cluster , therefore , the derived fundamental parameters of the cluster may be far away from the reality . on this background",
    ", the deep spectroscopic observations would be needed to determine the exact metallicity of the clusters .",
    "+ it is well known fact that the cluster radius is determined by considering the the spherical shape of the cluster , which is far away from the reality .",
    "it is needed to use an equation of other possible shape to determine the cluster extent , which may be change the present understanding towards the clusters morphology .",
    "since , the cluster are placed within the three dimensional ( 3d ) space and we are determined their extension by considering them as a two dimensional objects , therefore , the new 3d models are needed to constrain the clear picture of cluster extent .",
    "the limiting radii and core radii of the clusters are linked with the density profile , therefore , the identification of exact cluster center becomes most important due to fact that it may be occurred different for the non - spherical clusters .",
    "furthermore , the isodensity contour may become signature of the identification of the said center .",
    "the fraction of massive stars of a cluster may also signature of its ongoing evolutionary process leads dynamical behaviour and stage of the studied cluster . +",
    "the mean proper motion of the cluster is another site to understand the dynamical picture .",
    "the analytic study may open an opportunity to understand the future of cluster and varying characteristic of the clusters with time . since , the known proper motion values of the clusters are least reliable due to larger uncertainty in their estimation , therefore , the comprehensive ground based observations needed for this purpose .",
    "such type study may further leading to analysis the gravitational field within the cluster .",
    "the varying mean proper motion of various stellar mass bins may be useful to verify the mass segregation phenomena within the cluster .",
    "it is also needed to study about the possible changes of the proper motion of the cluster members with time .",
    "its deep analysis may also helpful to estimate the variation of evaporation rate of cluster members .",
    "+ the interstellar dust grains / clouds can be identified through the the analysis of tcds . since , said tcds are highly depends on the detected stars in the various bands .",
    "the observed magnitudes are varied due to the the quantity of the dust in the direction of cluster , which may reduce the brightness of the stars . since",
    ", the interstellar dust / cloud has uniformly distributed within the cluster region , therefore , the reduced fraction of the members are varied according to their mass .",
    "thus , it is necessary to applying magnitude corrections on the detected stars .",
    "such correction must be changed their distribution on the cmd plane leads changes in the fundamental parameters of the cluster .",
    "in addition , these tcds are also effectively used to determine the stellar subcategory and their analysis may helpful to understand the star formation mystery within the cluster .",
    "+ besides these , there are several oscs , for which , we have been very poor knowledge .",
    "the studies of this poor studied cluster and unknown cluster would be increased the database , which would be effectively utilized to constrain / verify the galactic evolution models .",
    "the combined results of the clusters may provides information about their evolution process and its dependency on their size .",
    "the locations of oscs can be effectively characterized the nature of density waves within the spiral arms . in conclusions ,",
    "the wide database of the clusters seems to be the building blocks of proposed evolutionary model of the our galaxy and the star formation sites .",
    "this research has made use of the vizier catalogue access tool , cds , strasbourg , france .",
