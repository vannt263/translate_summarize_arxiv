    "understanding the interplay between dust and gas is crucial for determining the evolutionary pathways of protoplanetary disks .",

    "models predict that massive planets clear their orbital paths , creating distinctive gaps in their natal disks @xcite .",
    "transition disks , characterized by observed dust deficits in the inner regions , may be the result of this process ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the recent discoveries of young substellar candidates in the transition disks t cha and lkca 15 lend credence to this hypothesis ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , processes other than orbital clearing can potentially cause dust deficits , including photoevaporation and grain growth . the gas distribution could be diagnostic of different scenarios . in disk photoevaporation models ,",
    "the dust is tied to the gas resulting in similar distributions and timescales @xcite .",
    "in contrast , grain growth to very large sizes would result in an apparent dust hole but no drop in the gas density .",
    "finally , stellar and planetary companions present an intermediate case with some movement of gas across the gaps into the inner disk expected depending on companion mass and location @xcite .",
    "the presence of gaps can enhance other disk clearing mechanisms such as the magneto - rotational instability @xcite and photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the gas distribution is also particularly relevant for studying young planets as the gas drives both formation and migration .",

    "spatially resolved 18.7 @xmath1 m imaging of the dust continuum revealed a ring - like structure with a peak - to - peak diameter of 110 au and a central hole with a radius of @xmath330 au @xcite .",
    "strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , commonly a tracer of gaseous molecular material , was unresolved and centered on the stellar position , interior to the ring seen in the 18.7 @xmath1 m dust .",
    "the co gas might be expected to follow the pah distribution and thus be located inside the dust hole .",
    "however , resolved imaging with the vlt - crires showed warm co emission in a 30 au radius ring , coincident with the proposed dust hole wall @xcite .",
    "the presence of pahs was explained by their longer survival time relative to co in high uv flux , low density regions .",
    "@xcite suggest that truncation of the gas and dust , as might be caused by a planet , lowers the density in the inner region leading to photodissociation of co interior to the truncation radius .",
    "this scenario should lead to a dust hole detectable with millimeter interferometry .",
    "millimeter imaging of transitional disks provides some of the best constraints on cavity size and characteristics .",
    "resolving the cavities requires both long baselines and good ( u , v ) coverage to achieve the necessary high spatial resolution and dynamic range .",
    "the optically thin emission observed in the submillimeter is very sensitive to the mass surface density profile .",

    "while the image is clearly not centrally peaked , we focus the analysis on the visibilities where a null more clearly defines the structure change .",
    "sharp transitions in the mass surface density , such as a hole , are seen in aperture synthesis observations as a null in the flux distribution with ( u , v ) distance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , most classical t tauri stars have power - law mass surface density profiles , resulting in a smooth decline of flux with ( u , v ) distance .",
    "another advantage of visibility domain analysis is a better understanding of the uncertainties , due to the lack of additional image processing , including fourier transformation and nonlinear deconvolution .",

    "the inclination was left as a free parameter in the similarity solution models with lower inclinations resulting in a smoother visibility profile and smaller @xmath31 .",
    "this could be the result of azimuthal averaging over asymmetric structure that is unseen at the sma resolution .",

    "the vlt - crires 5 @xmath1 m co observations are very sensitive to warm co with constraints both spatially and spectrally . however , the data are less sensitive to cold co and completely insensitive to non - molecular gas or other species of molecular gas .",

    "71% of the millimeter flux arises from dust within the 30 au radius gas ring . from all the models ,",
    "40 - 90 % of the millimeter emission must be interior to 30 au .",
    "we use the @xcite conversion of millimeter flux to disk mass with a @xmath35 of 1 @xcite .",
    "the dust temperature is taken to be in the range of 50 - 150 k. the gas mass within the 30 au co ring is then 10@xmath36 - 10@xmath37 m@xmath25 corresponding to a co mass of 10@xmath38 - 10@xmath39 m@xmath25 , assuming a h@xmath40/co number ratio of 10@xmath41 . in a flared disk with a scale height set to the hydrostatic pressure at 200",

    "significantly warmer gas is likely to produce 5 @xmath1 m co emission detectable in the crires data .",
    "there are three basic scenarios to reconcile the millimeter dust and 5 @xmath1 m co emission : 1 . ) the gas ( and dust ) is cold and therefore not detectable in the infrared , 2 . )",

    "shadowing from a puffed up inner rim , either at the millimeter dust wall or from atomic gas or pahs closer to the star , could cool the surface layers of the disk further out .",
    "the 5 @xmath1 m co limits the amount of warm gas within the 30 au gas radius but the limits are much less stringent at cooler temperatures ( @xcite , their figure 12 ) .",
    "a temperature of @xmath3150 k or less throughout the inner disk is needed to reconcile the 5 @xmath1 m co surface density limit with the modeled millimeter surface density , assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "any illuminated wall would also likely need to be devoid of co. the shadowing region would require a large scale height to shadow the disk out to 30 au . in order for this scenario to be plausible , the inner regions must be very settled while the outer structure is flared , exposing the surface layers to stellar radiation to produce the infrared emission .",
    "strong enough uv fields can photodissociate co , with the photodissociation rate in an unattenuated interstellar field being 2 x 10@xmath48 s@xmath49 . the uv field around an a0 star such as irs 48 is much stronger than the interstellar field even in the critical 912 - 1100  range and would lead to a photodissociation lifetime of @xmath501 year . however , co photodissociation is subject to self - shielding with the lines becoming saturated at a @xmath51co column density of about 10@xmath52 @xmath47 , strongly decreasing the photodissociation rate @xcite .",
    "both millimeter dust grains and pah molecules are also effective absorbers of uv radiation , lowering the uv field strength and thus the photodissociation rate .",
    "the estimated co density based on the millimeter dust would be strongly self - shielding making complete photodissociation unlikely .",
    "removal of only the gas within 30 au resulting in a strongly decreased gas - to - dust ratio is a final possibility .",
    "photoevaporation primarily affects the gas with small dust grains tied to the gas flow .",
    "it may be possible for large enough dust grains to remain .",
    "destructive collisions of the remaining large particles would then be needed to generate the pahs also seen from the inner regions .",
    "+   + these different scenarios should leave differing observational traces which further observations may be able to distinguish . in the case of cold co",
    ", alma observations will have the sensitivity and spatial resolution to look for cold co within the central region of the disk .",
    "for photodissociated co , optical spectroastrometric or high spectral resolution submillimeter observations of atomic c or o would determine if the photodissociation products of co are present within 30 au .",
    "if the gas is removed completely , neither cold co nor the atomic components of co would be present in the inner disk region .",
    "the ring of 18.7 @xmath1 m dust is even more difficult to understand with most of the emission coming from outside either the millimeter dust or the 5 @xmath1 m co. the dominant 18.7 @xmath1 m flux from @xmath355 au has no obvious counterpart in the millimeter emission . like the 5 @xmath1 m co",
    ", the 18.7 @xmath1 m flux comes from the disk surface and could reflect differences in illumination and heating of the surface layers rather than underlying changes in the distribution . however , the centrally - peaked pah emission points to some heating and small particles in the inner region .",
    "recent studies in the mid - ir and scattered light suggest that small surface particles within the cavities seen in larger grains are common @xcite .",
    "holes visible in the mid - ir are often of similar size to those seen in the submillimeter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the scattered light profiles , tracing the small surface grains , are smooth with no decrease within the cavity . dust filtration or trapping creating grain size differences across planetary gaps has been proposed @xcite , with the largest particles left on the outside of the gap and smaller particles , being more closely tied to the gas , allowed closer to the star . while the mid - ir dust and pahs in oph irs",
    "48 may fit this paradigm , the large millimeter dust interior to the smaller mid - ir emitting dust does not .",
    "likewise , 5 @xmath1 m co emission usually arises interior to submillimeter holes rather than from further out in disk @xcite . continued multiwavelength studies",
    "are vital to search for other examples of the inside - out nesting structure seen in the oph irs 48 disk .",
    "we have used new spatially resolved sma 880 @xmath1 m observations to place stringent constraints of the dust distribution within the oph irs 48 disk .",
    "the sma data clearly rules out that the millimeter dust distribution following either the 5 @xmath1 m co or 18.7 @xmath1 m dust . a large fraction of the millimeter flux is from dust interior to both the 18.7 @xmath53 dust ring ( 55 au radius ) and the 5 @xmath1 m co emission ( 30 au radius ) .",
