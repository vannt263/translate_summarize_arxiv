    "it is notoriously difficult to detect x  ray emission from sne .",
    "dominant x  ray emission mechanisms comprise an energetic shock break out soon after the explosion ( campana et al . 2006 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ) or the interaction of the shock front arising from the sn explosion with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "in particular , collisions of the ejected material with the csm ( made by material ejected from the progenitor prior to explosion ) can heat up matter to @xmath2 k , leading to x  ray emission .",
    "a reverse shock will also form propagating inward with a temperature @xmath3 k. alternatively , x  ray emission can arise from compton down - scattered gamma  rays of radioactive decay in the ejecta , or from inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons on photospheric uv photons produced during the outburst .",
    "nearby sne represent an ideal target for x  ray studies . on",
    "may 31.893 , 2011 ut a sn was discovered by several groups in the whirlpool galaxy m51 ( @xmath4 mpc , feldmeier , ciardullo & jacoby 1997 ) .",
    "the sn was classified as a type iib ( arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ; marion et al .",
    "2011 ) and named sn 2011dh ( griga et al .",
    "2011 ; silverman , filippenko & cenko 2011 ) .",
    "given its closeness attempts to identify a progenitor in pre - explosion hubble space telescope ( hst ) images have been carried out . a possible progenitor has been identified even if it is not certain ( maund et al . 2011 ; van dyk et al .",
    "photometry of this object is consistent with a yellow super - giant star . along these lines",
    "bersten et al .",
    "( 2012 ) modeled the optical light curve and the photospheric velocity evolution based on a set of hydrodynamical models , finding a very large progenitor radius of @xmath5 cm .",
    "a compact progenitor was instead suggested by other authors ( soderberg et al .",
    "2012 ; arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this case",
    "the identification of the progenitor was questioned and the radius estimate was based on radio properties leading to a radius estimate of @xmath6 cm .",
    "sne iib may be divided into two sub - classes based on the radius of the progenitor and on its mass loss history ( chevalier & soderberg 2010 ) .",
    "compact progenitors give rise to fast shock waves ( @xmath7 ) and modulated radio light curves ( sn ciib ) ; extended progenitors ( @xmath5 cm ) are characterized by slower shock waves and smoother radio curves ( sn eiib ) .",
    "hydrodynamical light curve modeling gives strong evidence that sn 2011dh belongs to the class of extended progenitors ( @xmath8 ; bersten et al .",
    "2012 ) .    here",
    "we report on x  ray observations on sn 2011dh .",
    "we will first report on two xmm - newton observations 7 and 11 d after the sn explosion ( section 2 ) . in light of these observations",

    "we adopted this model as our reference model ( last row in table 2 ) . in this case the unabsorbed 0.5 - 10 kev flux is @xmath14 erg @xmath12 s@xmath15 and @xmath16 erg @xmath12 s@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "these correspond to a 0.5 - 10 kev luminosities of @xmath17 erg s@xmath15 and @xmath18 erg s@xmath15 , respectively ( adopting a power law , fluxes and luminosities are @xmath19 lower ) .    -0.1truecm",

    "the light curve was built using the ukssdc light curve generator paying particular care not to include nearby sources ( fig .",

    "the overall curve can be fit with a power law decay with index @xmath24 ( including the small uncertainty involved by the determination of the sn explosion of 0.2 d , see fig .",
    "the fit is acceptable with a reduced @xmath25 ( 20 d.o.f . ) .",
    "one can notice a flux excess at the beginning of the observing time , possibly related a sn shock break out ( campana et al .",
    "2006 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ) . at the beginning of the observing time ,",
    "the first point in the x  ray light curve lies at @xmath26 from the model .",
    "the x  ray behavior might also be consistent with the optical / uv light curve ( arcavi et al .",
    "a bump in the x  ray light curve , even if not statistically significant , can also be observed at @xmath27 d after the sn explosion .",
    "this is barely consistent with the peak of the swift / uvot light curve in the @xmath28 band , when the sn peak is clearly visible ( arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we extracted two set of spectra .",
    "the first comprise the entire dataset . assuming the same absorption pattern derived from xmm - newton observations we can fit the 414 counts in the 0.310 kev energy band ( wit only @xmath29 due to the source ) with a power law model .",
    "the best fit photon index is @xmath30 .",
    "the reduced @xmath31 with 18 d.o.f .",
    "( @xmath32 null hypothesis probability ) . the average flux 0.310 kev unabsorbed flux is @xmath33 erg @xmath12 s@xmath15 ( giving a luminosity of @xmath34 erg s@xmath15 ) .",
    "a double mekal model improves only marginally the fit .",
    "this is expected because spectral evolution was observed , at least , across the two xmm - newton observations .",
    "a spectrum was also extracted taking data from the first five days , summing 30 ks of data and collecting 134 photons ( @xmath35 background ) . in this case",
    "the spectrum is harder , with a power law photon index of @xmath36 ( reduced @xmath25 for 11 d.o.f .",
    ", @xmath37 n.h.p . )",
    "the 0.310 kev unabsorbed flux is three times more than the average value .    -0.1truecm",
    "x  ray absorption holds the potential of tracing the presence of metals through their impact on the x  ray spectrum .",
    "xmm - newton observations clearly indicate a non - negligible absorbing column density in addition to the galactic contribution .",
    "this likely arise within m51 . assuming a solar distribution of elements and a solar metallicity the column density is @xmath38 ( @xmath10 confidence level ) .",
    "this value can be compared to optical estimates .",

    "a more thorough analysis was carried out by ritchey & wallerstein ( 2012 ) . from echelle observation of the sn , they derived na i column densities of the multiple components and estimated @xmath42 .",
    "the value derived from x  ray observations is slightly larger than this but still consistent .",
    "this would indicate that the surrounding medium has a metallicity similar to the solar value .",
    "one question is if this instrinsic absorbing column density is intrinsic to the source or due to some intervening matter in m51 along the line of sight but far away from the sn site .",
    "m51 is a nearby galaxy and it is well studied in the x  ray band . m51 hosts a number of ultra - luminous x  ray sources ( ulxs ) well studied and characterized ( dewangan et al . 2005 ; yoshida et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the two closest ulx sources to sn 2011dh are source 82 ( @xmath43 arcmin to the north ) and source 63 ( @xmath44 arcmin to the north - west ) .",
    "both sources are variable .",
    "the column density to source 82 is at a level of @xmath45 ( yoshida et al .",
    "we confirm this value with the analysis of our xmm - newton data ( assuming a power law spectrum ) .",
    "source 63 is fainter and the intrinsic column density ( assuming a power law plus mekal model ) is consistent with zero ( dewangan et al . 2005 ) . in our data source 63",
    "is a factor of @xmath46 fainter and we can not confirm these findings .",
    "we also note that the type ic sn 1994i occurred 2.3 arcmin away from sn 2011dh .",
    "no direct evidence for the presence of circumstellar matter was found in x  ray data ( namely too few photons to assess an increase over the galactic column density value ) , but the x  ray emission was interpreted as due to the interaction of the blast wave with its surrounding circumstellar material ( immler , wilson & terashima 2002 ) . from this comparison we can assess that we have , at least , found strong indications that the intrinsic column density observed in sn 2011dh is due to circumstellar material , as expected for a supergiant progenitor ( bersten et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "x  ray emission from sne iib has been observed in a very limited number of objects : sn 1993j ( chandra et al .",
    "2009 ) , sn 2001gd ( prez - torres et al .",
    "2005 ) , sn 2001ig ( schlegel & ryder 2002 ) , sn 2003bg ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ) , sn 2008ax ( roming et al .",
    "2009 ) , and sn 2011dh .",
    "sn 1993j is probably the best studied object .",
    "using rosat data , zimmermann & aschenbach ( 2003 ) found that the intrinsic column densities is much higher than the galactic column density .",
    "a deeper look came from asca data where uno et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , fitting a two - component thermal - plasma model , found that the low - temperature component has much higher column density than the high - temperature component .",
    "these high column densities in excess to the galactic absorption were attributed to the absorption by an additional cool shell .",
    "for all the other x  ray detected sn iib we have too few counts to assess if an intrinsic column density excess is present .",
    "thanks to the larger xmm - newton throughput , we were able to assess that the x  ray spectrum consists of one soft and one hard emission components ( modeled with the mekal model ) , likely related to a reverse shock as in sn 1993j ( chandra et al .",
    "2009 ; nymark et al .",
    "our best fit two component thermal plasma model is then fully consistent with shock model physics from sn explosions , i.e. , a hard thermal plasma component ( at a few kev ) that arises from the fast forward shock into the circumstellar material , and a soft thermal plasma component ( below 1 kev ) from the emergence of a reverse shock at lower speeds into the ejecta .",
    "since the reverse shock is located behind the forward shock , it is expected to have a higher absorbing column density than the forward shock .",
    "our xmm - newton observations clearly show a non - negligible absorbing column density in addition to the galactic contribution .    finally , a reanalysis of the swift xrt light curve might indicate a flux excess at the beginning of the x  ray observations . despite",
    "the fact that the statistical significance of this increase is low and the physical interpretation is challenging , this excess is likely due to the adiabatic cooling of stellar s photosphere a few days after the shock breakout .",
    "the time of the x  ray excess is identical to the time of the optical excess described by arcavi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and interpreted by them as the tail of the shock breakout emission .",
    "this might hint for a non - compact progenitor , i.e. yellow supergiant progenitor .",
    "sc thanks norbert schartel for granting ddt xmm - newton observations and neil gehrels and the swift science operations team for approving and scheduling the swift observational campaign .",
    "we thank the referee for comments that helped improving the manuscript . this work made use of data supplied by the uk swift science data centre at the university of leicester .",
