    "<S> we obtained an averaged pulse duration of 50 fs , degree of transverse coherence of about 80% , and degeneracy parameter of the order of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such values are similar to laser sources and were never observed at these wavelengths at conventional synchrotron radiation sources . however , our measurements of the higher - order correlation functions indicate that present fel sources based on the sase principle are essentially chaotic sources obeying gaussian statistics </S>",
    "<S> .    an interesting further application of the methods developed in this work would be the study of seeded fel sources @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing question is whether seeded fels are fully coherent sources in all orders according to glauber @xcite and in this way are equivalent to conventional single mode lasers , or if they obey gaussian statistics like sase fels . </S>",
    "<S> we could also foresee that intensity correlation analysis might be applied to study the dynamics of ultrafast processes at fels . for example , the intensity correlation analysis of the coulomb explosion in single molecule imaging experiments @xcite could provide detailed information about the disintegration of these molecules on a femtosecond time scale .    </S>",
