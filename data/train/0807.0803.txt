    "the majority of systems in nature operate far from equilibrium , but there is no developed theoretical framework for comprehensive analysis of non - equilibrium processes . in this situation , a critical role for understanding different complex phenomena in chemistry , physics and biology is played by a class of low - dimensional non - equilibrium multi - particle models known as asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( asep ) @xcite .",
    "asep are stochastic models where particle interact via an exclusion potential and move along discrete lattices",
    ". mechanisms of many non - equilibrium processes , such as biological transport , kinetics of protein synthesis and biopolymerization , car traffic , and hopping of quantum dots , have become better understood due to the successful description via asymmetric exclusion models @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies of exclusion processes concentrate on single - lane systems where important exact solutions have been obtained in several cases @xcite .",
    "recently , a lot of attention has also been devoted to parallel multi - chain exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "the study of these models has been greatly stimulated by experimental advances in analysis of motor proteins dynamics along cytoskeleton filaments , in transport of mesoscopic quantum systems and in vehicular traffic processes @xcite .",
    "in parallel multi - chain exclusion processes particles can jump along the horizontal chains , but they can also switch stochastically between different lanes",
    ". theoretical analysis of different multi - chain asep suggests that coupling between the channels strongly influences stationary - state phases and particle properties .",
    "it can produce a complex dynamic behavior , leading to many unusual phenomena , such localized domain walls and symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "investigations of multi - chain exclusion processes mostly involves coupling of asymmetric channels where the direction of particles motion is biased at each site on all channels .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze parallel coupling of symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes .",
    "the problem is motivated by the cellular transport of motor proteins along rigid protein filaments such as actin filaments or microtubules @xcite .",
    "motor protein molecules can move mostly in one direction when they are tightly bound to protein lattices .",
    "occasionally , motor proteins might dissociate from the filament to the surrounding solution where they perform unbiased diffusional motion .",
    "freely diffusing molecules can also bind to protein filaments .",
    "there is only one previous theoretical work that investigates coupling of tasep and ssep , although periodic boundary conditions and symmetric transition rates between the lanes are assumed @xcite . using several mean - field approaches and extensive computer simulations",
    "it was found that there is unequal redistribution of particles between different channels depending on the densities @xcite . in a related study , lipowsky and coworkers investigated transport of molecular motors in open tube that contains a single filament @xcite . bound to the filament particles",
    "undergo asymmetric exclusion process , while the unbound molecular motors diffuse freely in the tube around the linear chain .",
    "the analysis of the molecular motor transport via tube - like compartments , performed with the help of mean - field methods and monte carlo simulations , revealed that there are three stationary phases with phase transitions specified by the precise choice of boundary conditions @xcite . in our work",
    "we investigate a two - channel system consisting asymmetric and symmetric exclusion lanes with open boundary conditions , and with symmetric and asymmetric transition rates between the channels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a detailed description of the model",
    "is given , and exact solutions for strong couplings and approximate solutions for intermediate couplings are presented . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss monte carlo computer simulations and compare them with theoretical predictions . the final section 4 summarizes and concludes .",
    "our model consists of two parallel one - dimensional lattices as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "both lanes have @xmath0 sites , and we are interested in obtaining thermodynamic limit results when @xmath1 .",
    "particles move along the channels by hopping between the lattice sites with the exclusion potential , i.e. , each site can be occupied by no more than one particle . in our model",
    "we apply a random sequential update when at each time step dynamics at randomly chosen site is followed .",
    "particles can enter the system with the rate @xmath2 if one or both first sites on channel 1 and 2 are not occupied .",
    "similarly , particles exit the system with the rate @xmath3 if any of last sites are occupied . in the bulk of the system dynamic rules",
    "depend on the lattice : see figure 1 .",
    "the particle at site @xmath4 can switch to the same site on the lattice 2 with the rate @xmath5 if this site is empty , or with the rate @xmath6 it hops to unoccupied site @xmath7 on the lattice 1 .",
    "however , if the site @xmath4 in the second channel is occupied , the particle jumps in the horizontal direction to the right with the rate 1 if the forward site is available .",
    "the particle at the site @xmath4 on the lattice 2 can move vertically with the rate @xmath8 if the upper site @xmath4 is free , or it can jump horizontally in either direction with the rate @xmath9 if sites @xmath7 or @xmath10 are available . however , if the upper site @xmath4 is already occupied , the particle can move with the rate 1/2 in the forward or backward directions , assuming that any of these moves are not blocked by already present particles at sites @xmath10 or @xmath7 . the total transition rate out of every site @xmath4 in any channel is equal to one . when the transition rates between the channels are equal ( @xmath11 ) the coupling is symmetric , while for @xmath12 the coupling between the lattices is asymmetric .     and @xmath8 .",
    "allowed transitions are shown by arrows .",
    "entrance rates at both lattices are equal to @xmath13 and exit rates are equal to @xmath14 . ]",
    "when the inter - channel transition rates are equal to zero ( @xmath15 ) , the system decouples into two independent single - lane exclusion processes : the upper channel becomes a totally asymmetric process and the lower channel is a symmetric process .",
    "exact solutions for single - lane tasep and ssep are known @xcite , and they provide a full description of all dynamic properties at large times . for tasep",
    "there are three stationary - state phases .",
    "if the entrance to the lattice is a rate - limiting step , which happens for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the system is found in a low - density ( ld ) phase with the particle current and bulk density given by @xmath18 however , when exit of particles controls the overall dynamics ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , the system is in a high - density ( hd ) phase where the stationary current and bulk density are @xmath21 in the third phase , called a maximal - current ( mc ) , the dynamics is governed by bulk processes ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , and stationary properties are the following , @xmath24    the stationary properties of ssep are much simpler with only one non - equilibrium phase at all conditions @xcite . for the lattice with @xmath0 sites the density profile is linear , @xmath25 the average current in the steady - state of ssep",
    "is given by @xmath26 it can be easily seen that in the limit of @xmath27 the current in the ssep is approaching zero .",
    "there are very few exact results for multi - channel exclusion processes obtained by mapping them into effective single - lane exclusion models @xcite .",
    "typical approaches to analyze coupled multi - channel systems involve various mean - field treatments supported by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "probably , one of the most successful approximate approaches is a vertical - cluster mean - field method @xcite , that describes the dynamics of inter - channel transitions explicitly and neglects correlations for horizontal transitions .",
    "we will also utilize this method for analyzing parallel coupling between tasep and ssep .",
    "each vertical cluster can be described by introducing functions @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) that define the probability of different states .",
    "@xmath30 corresponds to the state when both sites of the vertical cluster are empty , @xmath31 describes the state with both sites occupied , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 specify partially filled vertical clusters with the occupied site on the channel 1 or 2 , respectively .",
    "these probability functions are related via a normalization condition , @xmath34      in order to understand mechanisms of coupling between tasep and ssep , it is instructive to consider strong coupling regimes .",
    "first , let us analyze the case of symmetric coupling with @xmath15 . in this case in the stationary - state limit",
    "it is not possible to observe the vertical configuration @xmath35 with two empty sites .",
    "this is because this configuration can only be obtained by moving the particle horizontally if the previous state of the same cluster was @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "however , the rates for these transitions are zero ( @xmath38 ) , and we conclude that for any bulk vertical cluster @xmath39 . it can be also argued that symmetry of the coupling requires to have @xmath40 for any bulk vertical cluster .",
    "then in the system there are only two types of vertical clusters : half - filled and fully filled .",
    "one can view @xmath41 vertical clusters as effective `` particles '' and half - filled vertical clusters as effective `` holes . ''",
    "these `` particles '' can advance forward with the rate @xmath42 , or they can move backward with the rate @xmath43 .",
    "they enter the system with the effective rate @xmath44 and leave it with the effective rate @xmath45 .",
    "the factor 2 comes from the fact that in the last vertical cluster both particles can exit independently .",
    "thus the two - channel system is mapped into a new effective single - channel partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( pasep ) , for which _ exact _ solutions are known @xcite .",
    "similarly to totally asymmetric exclusion processes there are three stationary phases in pasep @xcite .",
    "the ld phase exists for @xmath16 and @xmath46 , and the stationary properties of this phase can be written as @xmath47 the hd phase can be found for @xmath19 and @xmath48 with the particle current and bulk density given by @xmath49 in the mc phase ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) the stationary properties are the following , @xmath52 applying these results to our system , it is trivial to show that the ld phase is specified by @xmath53 and @xmath54 with the particle current and bulk density given by @xmath55 the hd phase exists for @xmath56 and @xmath57 with the following stationary properties , @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 we have the mc phase with @xmath61 the resulting density profiles for strong coupling limit are shown in figures 2a , 3a and 4a , while the phase diagram is outlined in figure 5a .",
    "exact solutions via mapping to a single - channel exclusion process can also be found for strong asymmetric couplings .",
    "let us show this for the case of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "for the arbitrary bulk vertical cluster at site @xmath4 we have @xmath64 , because there should not be the overall vertical current in the system at large times .",
    "it can be argued that the whole lattice 2 is fully occupied at large times after the system reaches a steady state .",
    "if any vacancy appears then it will be quickly filled by vertical transition form the upper channel .",
    "this observation suggests that bulk vertical clusters can only be found in two states , @xmath41 and @xmath37 with @xmath65 .",
    "note , however , that other cluster states might exist near the boundaries , but they should not affect the overall dynamics in the system .",
    "we associate the fully filled vertical clusters @xmath41 with `` particles '' , while the vertical clusters @xmath37 can be viewed as `` holes . ''",
    "there is the particle flux in the upper channel , and there is no current on the lattice 2 and the bulk density in the channel 2 is always equal to one .",
    "thus , we mapped the system that couples asymmetric and symmetric exclusion process into new effective tasep in the limit of strong asymmetric coupling .",
    "the effective entrance rate for the `` particles '' is equal to @xmath44 .",
    "however , the exit process should be considered more carefully . the overall particle flux to leave the channels",
    "can be written as @xmath66 and it should be equal to the bulk current , @xmath67 it leads to the following relation for density of fully filled vertical clusters at the end of the system , @xmath68 which also yields the effective exit rate , @xmath69 now , using known results for tasep we can predict that in the two - channel exclusion system with strong asymmetric coupling there are three stationary phases .",
    "entrance dominated low - density phase exists for @xmath70 and @xmath71 . here",
    "the stationary properties are @xmath72 exit dominated high - density phase is found for @xmath73 and @xmath74 with the following particle current and bulk density on the lattice 1 : @xmath75 finally , in the maximal - current phase ( for @xmath22 and @xmath76 ) we have @xmath77 density profiles for strong asymmetric coupling with @xmath62 and @xmath63 are shown in figures 2c , 3c and 4c , and the phase diagram is presented in figure 5c",
    ".    the other case of the asymmetric coupling , when @xmath78 and @xmath79 , can be easily analyzed if we recall the particle - hole symmetry of the system . the flux of particles moving from the left to right can be viewed as a flux of holes moving in opposite direction .",
    "then stationary properties in this case can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ ld4 ] ) , ( [ hd4 ] ) and ( [ mc4 ] ) derived above if we perform the symmetry operations @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in this case , the nonzero particle current will be found only in the upper ( asymmetric ) channel , but there will be no particles and no flux in the bulk of the symmetric lattice .      when couplings between asymmetric and symmetric exclusion processes are not strong ( @xmath82 and/or @xmath83 ) it is not possible to solve the system exactly via mapping procedure",
    ". then an approximate theory should be developed .",
    "we will use the vertical - cluster mean - field approach @xcite that was successful in description of other two - channel exclusion processes .",
    "the overall properties of the system can be found by monitoring changes in four vertical clusters at each site .",
    "assuming that the behavior is uniform along the lattices , the dynamics of bulk vertical clusters is governed by three independent master equations : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 at large times the system reaches steady state , implying that @xmath87 for @xmath29 . then from equations ( [ me2 ] ) and ( [ me3 ] ) we can immediately conclude that @xmath88 this expression can be understood as an equilibrium for vertical transitions between the channels in the bulk . then substituting this relation along with the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) into equation ( [ me1 ] )",
    "produces @xmath89 we expect that , similarly to the cases of strong couplings , there are three stationary phases . to obtain stationary properties",

    "<S> + a system consisting of two parallel coupled channels where particles in one of them follow the rules of totally asymmetric exclusion processes ( tasep ) and in another one move as in symmetric simple exclusion processes ( ssep ) is investigated theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> particles interact with each other via hard - core exclusion potential , and in the asymmetric channel they can only hop in one direction , while on the symmetric lattice particles jump in both directions with equal probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> inter - channel transitions are also allowed at every site of both lattices . </S>",
    "<S> stationary state properties of the system are solved exactly in the limit of strong couplings between the channels . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that strong symmetric couplings between totally asymmetric and symmetric channels lead to an effective partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( pasep ) and properties of both channels become almost identical . however , strong asymmetric couplings between symmetric and asymmetric channels yield an effective tasep with nonzero particle flux in the asymmetric channel and zero flux on the symmetric lattice . for intermediate strength of couplings between the lattices </S>",
    "<S> a vertical cluster mean - field method is developed . </S>",
    "<S> this approximate approach treats exactly particle dynamics during the vertical transitions between the channels and it neglects the correlations along the channels . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that in all cases there are three stationary phases defined by particle dynamics at entrances , at exits or in the bulk of the system , while phase boundaries depend on the strength and symmetry of couplings between the channels . </S>",
    "<S> extensive monte carlo computer simulations strongly support our theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical calculations and computer simulations predict that inter - channel couplings have a strong effect on stationary properties . </S>",
    "<S> it is also argued that our results might be relevant for understanding multi - particle dynamics of motor proteins . </S>"
