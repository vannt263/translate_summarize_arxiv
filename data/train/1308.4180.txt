    "records , the largest observed values in a sequence of data points @xcite , have long been a topic of interest  anybody who has watched the olympics will appreciate that much of the suspense lies in seeing if a new world record will be set .",
    "records are a useful tool for characterization of complex systems @xcite , and the study of records and their statistical properties has proved valuable in a wide swathe of disciplines , ranging from climate science @xcite and hydrology @xcite to economics @xcite .",
    "recent investigations concerning the statistical mechanics of records @xcite reveal rich and interesting phenomenology associated with the effects of round - off errors on record statistics @xcite as well as first - passage behavior @xcite of record sequences @xcite . here",
    ", we introduce a first - passage characteristic that probes how records improve with time , and demonstrate its usefulness for analysis of empirical data .",
    "tracking an observable over time , one sees the generation of a sequence of records , each new record improving upon the previous one by some finite amount .",
    "intuitively , we expect these improvements to diminish with each new record : the larger the current record is , the less likely it is that the next record improves upon it by a large amount . in this study",
    "we ask : how likely we are to see only shrinking improvements over previous records ?",
    "consider an evolving sequence of @xmath1 identical and independently distributed random variables .",
    "the first element of this sequence is , by definition , a record .",
    "each subsequent element is a record if it is greater than the previous record .",
    "moreover , a new record improves upon the existing one by some increment , defined as the difference between the two records .",
    "we study the probability @xmath0 that all increments decrease monotonically ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ill ] ) , and our main result is the scaling law @xmath6 which holds in the large-@xmath1 limit . when the random variables are drawn from a compact , uniform distribution , we obtain analytically the exponent @xmath7    our definition of incremental records involves the current record and the previous record , or alternatively , the current record and the current increment .",
    "consequently , the theoretical analysis requires the joint distribution of these two variables .",
    "interestingly , the record and the increment become uncorrelated in the large-@xmath1 limit , such that the joint distribution is a product of the record distribution and the increment distribution .",
    "the former distribution is exponential , but the latter is broad and has power - law tail .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we examine the record distribution , and show that it is the same regardless of whether one considers the set of all records sequences or just the subset of incremental ones .",
    "next , we study the increment distribution which in turn requires the full joint distribution of records and increments ( section iii ) .",
    "we obtain the increment distribution in the scaling limit , and derive the scaling exponent @xmath5 as a byproduct . in section iv , we measure the fraction of incremental records for the sequence of waiting times between large earthquakes , and observe good agreement with the theoretical results .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "let us consider a sequence of uncorrelated random variables , @xmath8 each variable @xmath9 is independently drawn from the probability distribution function @xmath10 , with the normalization @xmath11 . in many applications , including the earthquake example discussed in section iv , new variables are constantly added to the dataset . hence , we may view the sequence as evolving with the variable @xmath1 playing the role of time @xcite .",
    "the record @xmath12 equals the largest variable in a sub - sequence of length @xmath13 . a newly added variable sets a record if it is larger than the previous record , @xmath14 for @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the first variable necessarily sets a record , , and by definition , the records increase monotonically , .",
    "we focus on the simplest case of a uniform distribution with support in a finite interval , taken without loss of generality as the unit interval , @xmath17 this distribution is relevant for waiting times between successive earthquakes ( see section iv ) .",
    "the cumulative record distribution @xmath18 equals the probability that the record @xmath19 is smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "this distribution is simply @xmath21 indeed , by substituting into @xmath22 we have @xmath23 , and further , for the @xmath1th record to be smaller than @xmath20 , all @xmath1 variables must be smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "since the variables are identical and independently distributed , every one of the @xmath1 variables is equally likely to be the largest .",
    "hence , the probability that the @xmath1th variable sets a record equals @xmath24 , and consequently , the average number of records equals the harmonic number .",
    "the slow logarithmic growth of this sum demonstrates that when @xmath1 becomes large , new records are few and far between @xcite .",
    "further , we expect that the improvements made with each new record diminish with time .",
    "the increment , defined as the difference between the new record and the old record , quantifies such improvements . together with the current record @xmath19 we also track the _ current increment _",
    "@xmath25 defined by @xmath26 for @xmath15 .",
    "again , @xmath27 since the first variable is a record .    in this study",
    ", we restrict our attention to the subset of sequences where all increments decrease monotonically , @xmath28 if this inequality holds , the sequence of records @xmath29 is said to be _",
    "incremental_. we are interested in the probability @xmath0 that a record sequence of length @xmath1 is incremental .",
    "essentially , we require that the quantity @xmath30 remains non - negative . in this sense",
    ", the condition defines a first - passage process , and the quantity @xmath0 is analogous to a survival probability @xcite .    as a preliminary step ,",
    "we analyze the distribution of incremental records .",
    "specifically , we define the cumulative density @xmath31 as the fraction of sequences that : ( i ) have incremental records , namely , satisfy the condition , and ( ii ) have a record smaller than @xmath20 , that is , @xmath32 . of course ,",
    "@xmath33 .     with incremental records and current record @xmath34.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    when @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 and hence , @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 , the two - variable sequence @xmath39 corresponds to a point inside the unit square ( figure [ fig - trapezoid ] ) .",
    "if @xmath40 , the record sequence is necessarily incremental . otherwise , the sequence is incremental if and only if @xmath41 .",
    "accordingly , the lines @xmath42 and @xmath43 divide the unit square into three triangles , in two of which the condition holds . to obtain the probability @xmath44 that an incremental sequence has record @xmath45 , we overlay a square of area @xmath46 onto the unit square .",
    "the overlap between this square and the two relevant triangles is a trapezoid with height @xmath20 , and bases @xmath20 and @xmath47 ( figure [ fig - trapezoid ] ) .",
    "the area of this trapezoid gives the cumulative record density @xmath48 and hence , @xmath49 .",
    "this illuminating example suggests that generally , @xmath50 indeed , when @xmath51 , in addition to the planes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and similarly , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , there is a fifth plane @xmath54 that corresponds to three distinct records .",
    "these planes specify a polyhedron with volume @xmath55 , embedded inside a cube of volume @xmath56 ; the condition holds inside this polyhedron . in general , the hyperplanes defined by are invariant under the transformation @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , the cumulative distribution equals the volume of an @xmath1-dimensional polyhedron , embedded in an @xmath1-dimensional hypercube of volume @xmath58 .",
    "this geometric argument and the normalization @xmath59 support equation ( numerical confirmation is shown in figure [ fig - fnx ] ) .",
    "remarkably , the normalized distribution function @xmath60 is identical to @xmath18 given in .",
    "hence , records in incremental sequences and records in all sequences are characterized by _",
    "identical _ distribution functions .     for @xmath61 .",
    "the circles represents results of monte carlo simulations and the lines show the corresponding monomials @xmath58.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    our main focus is the asymptotic behavior in the limit @xmath62 where the cumulative density follows the scaling form ( figure [ fig - fn - scaling ] ) @xmath63 to obtain this form , we simply rewrite and consider the limits @xmath62 and @xmath64 with the scaling variable @xmath65 being finite .",
    "thus , the term @xmath58 implies that the record distribution is exponential @xcite .     of incremental sequences with scaled record @xmath66 that is larger than @xmath67 .",
    "also shown for reference is the prediction @xmath68 that follows from eq .",
    "as evident from the definitions and , the increment is coupled to the record . hence , further analysis requires the joint record - increment distribution .",
    "we study the probability density @xmath69 , defined such that @xmath70 is the probability that the record @xmath19 lies in the infinitesimal range @xmath71 and similarly , the increment @xmath25 is in the range @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath73 , the fraction of incremental sequences is the following integral of the joint density , @xmath74    the probability density satisfies the recursion equation @xmath75 for @xmath76 , with @xmath77 as the first element is necessarily a record . the first term on the right - hand side of accounts for cases where the old record holds .",
    "the integral term accounts for situations where the old record , which necessarily equals @xmath78 , is surpassed by a new record ; the lower integration limit enforces the monotonicity condition .",
    "starting with @xmath77 we find @xmath79 from which @xmath80 is recovered .",
    "to study the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath1 , we convert the recursion equation into the integro - differential equation @xmath81 to obtain this equation , we subtract @xmath69 from both sides of and then replace the difference @xmath82 with the derivative @xmath83 .",
    "the scaling behavior shows that @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , the integral term in implies that , similarly , the increment is inversely proportional to sequence length , @xmath85 .",
    "hence , we anticipate the scaling form @xmath86 the normalization sets the prefactor @xmath87 and implies that the scaling function @xmath88 is normalized , @xmath89 .",
    "if we integrate the joint scaling function over the scaled increment , we should recover the distribution of the scaled record , given in , @xmath90    , measured from monte carlo simulations is compared with the theoretical result - .",
    "the numerical results are obtained from @xmath91 independent realizations.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    next , we substitute along with @xmath92 as in into the evolution equation , and find that the scaling function satisfies @xmath93 remarkably , this rather involved integro - differential equation admits a separation - of - variables solution @xmath94 this form is consistent with eq .",
    "when the scaling function @xmath95 that characterizes the distribution of increments , is normalized , @xmath96 .",
    "the factorizing form implies that records and increments become uncorrelated in the limit @xmath62 , an assumption that is supported by the numerical simulations ( see below ) .     that the scaled increment @xmath97 is larger than the scaling variable @xmath98 .",
    "the simulation results were obtained by generating @xmath99 independent increments for a sequence of length @xmath100 .",
    "the theoretical result represents a numerical solution of with @xmath5 given by eq ..",
    ",scaledwidth=47.5% ]    by substituting the factorizing form into the governing equation , we obtain the integro - differential equation @xmath101 we can convert this first - order equation for @xmath95 into a second order ordinary differential equation for its integral , @xmath102 , @xmath103 the two boundary conditions are @xmath104 and .",
    "the former follows from the fact that @xmath95 is normalized , and the second boundary condition follows from equation itself .",
    "equation has two independent solutions . in the large-@xmath98 limit , the rightmost term in eq .",
    "vanishes , and consequently , one of these solution approaches a constant , @xmath105 , while the other decays algebraically , @xmath106 this former solution is not physical because the scaling function @xmath95 vanishes in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 plays the role of an `` eigenvalue '' of equation .",
    "numerically , we integrate with a trial value @xmath108 .",
    "when @xmath109 , the solution approaches a nonzero constant @xmath110 when @xmath111 .",
    "only when @xmath112 equals the eigenvalue @xmath5 , does this constant vanish @xmath113 , and the physical solution is realized .",
    "we used the adams method @xcite to perform the numerical integration and the bisection method @xcite to find the root of the equation @xmath113 .",
    "the result @xmath114 quoted in follows .",
    "equation implies that the increment distribution decays algebraically for sufficiently large increments .",
    "let @xmath115 be the probability that an incremental sequence has latest increment in the range @xmath116 .",
    "the probability density @xmath117 follows from the joint density , @xmath118 by substituting the scaling behavior with the factorizing form into the integral , we find that the increment density has the scaling form @xmath119 the scaling function @xmath95 is simply @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , using the algebraic tail , we find .",
    "hence , the increment density decays algebraically , @xmath121 for sufficiently large increments @xmath122 .",
    "the algebraic decay matches our expectation that is based on a simple heuristic argument .",
    "the probability that the first element is largest equals @xmath123 . since a sequence with only one record is incremental , we expect that @xmath124 .",
    "this behavior agrees with .",
    "hence , from the extreme case of a single record that is nearly maximal , @xmath125 , we can derive the algebraic behavior from the scaling behavior together with .",
    "we note that the same argument applies to all record sequences .",
    "this heuristic argument , combined with the fact that @xmath126 , yields @xmath127 for all record sequences .",
    "we performed numerical simulations to test the above predictions . in each simulation run , the initial record and the initial increment are respectively set as @xmath16 and @xmath128 .",
    "then at each step a random number in the range @xmath129 $ ] is drawn @xcite .",
    "the record and the increment are calculated from and respectively .",
    "this elementary step is iterated as long as the monotonicity condition @xmath130 is satisfied , but the run is aborted when this condition is violated for the _ first _ time .",
    "for example , the quantity @xmath0 is measured as the fraction of such runs where at least @xmath131 random numbers where generated .",
    "results of these monte carlo simulations confirm the theoretical prediction .",
    "first , as shown in figure [ fig - sn ] , the fraction of incremental sequences decays algebraically as in equations - .",
    "second , as shown in figure [ fig - compare ] , the probability @xmath132 that the scaled increment @xmath97 is larger than @xmath98 agrees with the predictions of equation , with the exponent @xmath5 specified in . finally , we also confirmed directly that the record and the increment become uncorrelated , that is , @xmath133 when @xmath62 .",
    "as calculated using data for earthquakes of magnitude @xmath134 and above .",
    "the empirical results are compared with theoretical predictions for the compact , uniform distribution.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]",
    "records are a basic feature of a data set , as for example , the record high and record low specify the span of the set . it is natural to ask whether the statistical measures introduced in this study are useful as a data analysis tool .",
    "we believe that the notion of incremental records is a sensible measure of performance @xcite , especially since it involves no prior knowledge of how the random variables are distributed . also , determining whether a sequence includes only incremental records is straightforward . there is a difficulty , however . in practice , a very large number of data points is required to accurately measure the fraction @xmath0 because this survival probability decays as a power - law .    here",
    ", we analyze inter - event times between successive earthquakes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was demonstrated that the average number of records in inter - event times is a straightforward test for whether powerful earthquakes occur randomly in time and follow poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "inter - event times are not bounded from above , but they are bounded from below , by zero .",
    "given that our theoretical analysis applies to bounded random variables , rather than studying increments in the record high , we studied decrements in the record low . as the transformation @xmath135 shows , the behavior - also characterizes decrements in record lows .",
    "our dataset lists the event times for the @xmath136 earthquakes with magnitude @xmath137 @xcite that occurred worldwide during the years @xmath138 @xcite . from these event times , the sequence of inter - event times is constructed as a list of the waiting times between consecutive earthquakes ( zero waiting times are ignored ) .",
    "our procedure for determining @xmath0 from this data set is to treat @xmath1 consecutive data points as an independent sequence , and then calculate the fraction of these which have only incremental records .",
    "that is to say , when calculating @xmath139 we consider each individual element of the full data set to be a sequence of length @xmath140 , when calculating @xmath141 each consecutive pair of events to be a distinct sequence of length @xmath142 , and so forth .    as fig .",
    "[ fig - earth ] shows , we observe scaling behavior which closely matches the theoretical predictions - .",
    "the measured exponent is remarkably close to the theoretical value @xmath143 as discussed in the conclusions , the tail of the distribution function from which the random variables are drawn controls @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "hence , the empirical data combined with the theoretical results above suggests that there are no singularities ( due to aftershocks ) in the distribution of inter - event times , @xmath144 .",
    "moreover , the empirical results show that the fraction of incremental records is a sensible quantity in the context of data analysis , and provide an example where the fraction @xmath0 decays algebraically .     versus the parameter @xmath145 characterizing the parent distribution @xmath10 in .,scaledwidth=47.5% ]",
    "in conclusion , we studied the probability that all records in a sequence of random variables are incremental . in our definition ,",
    "a record is incremental if it improves upon the previous record by a yet smaller amount .",
    "we found two scaling laws : one for the probability that a sequence is incremental , and one for the distribution of increments .",
    "a single scaling exponent underlies both of these scaling laws .",
    "interestingly , even for the simplest case of identical and independently distributed random variables , drawn from a uniform distribution , this scaling exponent is nontrivial . using an empirical analysis of earthquake data",
    ", we demonstrated that statistics of incremental records are a sensible tool for data analysis .",
    "our theoretical analysis involved the joint distribution of record value and increment size .",
    "initially , these two variables are perfectly correlated , but as the sequence grows , the correlation between these two variables diminishes , and it eventually vanishes .",
    "this key observation allows us to solve for the full distribution of records and increments in the scaling limit and obtain as a byproduct the scaling exponent .",
    "our study concerns an ensemble of sequences for which improvements in records diminish steadily with time .",
    "it is useful to compare statistical properties of records and increments for this restricted ensemble of sequences with the corresponding behavior for the full ensemble of sequences @xcite .",
    "our findings show that the most basic characteristic , the record , does not distinguish between these two ensembles , yet , differences in the record are a more sensitive measure whose distribution does differentiate between the two .    in a recent related study , it was shown that another measure for performance , the probability that records always remain above their expected average , is also characterized by a nontrivial scaling exponent @xcite .",
    "taken together , these two closely related studies indicate that there is a family of first - passage exponents @xcite that characterize extreme statistics .    an interesting challenge is to generalize the above results to arbitrary distributions , both compact and noncompact .",
    "numerically , we also studied the general class of compact distribution functions with algebraic tail @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "the simulations show that the exponent @xmath5 varies continuously with the parameter @xmath145 ( figure [ fig - numu ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , this behavior is in line with the results of several other studies showing that the tail of the distribution @xmath148 governs scaling laws for extreme statistics @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to establish whether the increment and the record decouple in general , and to obtain the scaling exponent @xmath5 using analytic methods .",
    "we thank paul krapivsky for collaboration in early stages of this work , ivan christov and joan gomberg for useful discussions , and chunquan wu for assistance with the earthquake data .",
