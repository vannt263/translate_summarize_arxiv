    "similarly to other normal galaxies , x - ray emission from the bulge of the andromeda galaxy is dominated by accreting compact sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there is relatively bright extended emission which nature was explored in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) based on extensive set of _ chandra _ observations . in paper",
    "i we revealed the presence of warm ionized ism in the bulge which most likely forms a galactic - scale outflow and showed that bulk of unresolved emission is associated with old stellar population , similar to the galactic ridge x - ray emission in the milky way @xcite .",
    "although these studies led to a much better understanding of x - ray emission from the bulge of m31 , the disk of the galaxy could not be investigated in similar detail due to insufficient _ chandra _ data coverage of the galaxy .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data , available at the time , also did not provide adequate coverage of the galaxy either , with only the northern part of the disk observed with relatively short exposures @xcite .    over the last several years _ xmm - newton _ completed a survey of m31 , which data has become publicly available now .",
    "the numerous pointings with total exposure time of @xmath7 ms give a good coverage of the entire galaxy .",
    "with these data it has become possible to study x - ray emission from the disk of the galaxy . in the present paper we concentrate on the unresolved emission component and",
    "compare its characteristics in the disk and bulge .",
    "we also study the 10-kpc star - forming ring to support our earlier claim that excess unresolved emission is associated with star - forming regions in the galactic disk ( paper i ) .",
    "classical nova explosions are caused by thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary system @xcite . in order for the nuclear runaway to start , a certain amount of hydrogen rich material , @xmath8 , needs to be accumulated on the wd surface @xcite .",
    "this material is supplied by the donor star and is accreted onto the wd .",
    "obviously , there is a direct relation between the frequency of cne and collective accretion rate in their progenitors .",
    "the accretion energy is released in the form of electromagnetic radiation which spectrum depends on the type of the progenitor system . in certain types of accreting",
    "wds it peaks in the x - ray band , for example in magnetic systems  polars and intermediate polars .",
    "emission from these systems contributes to the unresolved emission in the galaxy , therefore their number and contribution to the cn rate can be constrained using high resolution x - ray data .",
    "this is the subject of the second part of the paper .",
    "note , that a similar line of arguments can be used to constrain the nature of progenitors of type ia supernovae @xcite .    in the following",
    ", the distance to m31 is assumed to be @xmath9 kpc @xcite and the galactic hydrogen column density is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the analyzed x - ray and near - infrared data and the main steps of its reduction . in section 3",
    "results of the analysis of unresolved x - ray emission are presented . in section 4",
    "we derive constraints on the nature of cn progenitors .",
    "our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "we analyzed @xmath11 observations from _ xmm - newton _ survey of m31 , listed in table [ tab : xmm ] .",
    "the data was taken between 2000 june 25 and 2007 july 25 and covers nearly the entire disk of m31 and its bulge . the approximate coverage of the galaxy by _ xmm - newton _ data is illustrated in the left panel of fig . [ fig : bigm31 ] .",
    "we analyzed the data of the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) instruments @xcite , for its reduction we used science analysis system (    sas    ) version 7.1 .",
    ".the list of _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations used for the analysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath12 the classification for v1500 cyg , v597 pup and v4633 sgr was taken from @xcite @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "+ references are from : @xmath13 @xcite ",
    "@xcite [ tab : cne ]        polars ( am her systems ) and intermediate polars ( ips ) are accreting binary systems in which the accretion disk is partly ( ips ) or entirely ( am her systems ) disrupted by magnetic field of the white dwarf .",
    "these systems are sources of relatively hard x - ray emission produced via optically - thin bremsstrahlung in an accretion shock near the wd surface .",
    "they also may have a prominent soft component generated by the wd surface illuminated by hard x - rays .",
    "theory predicts @xcite and observations confirm @xcite that the soft component account for @xmath21 of the total accretion luminosity of polars .",
    "intermediate polars may also have a soft component in their spectra of somewhat smaller luminosity , @xmath22 of the total @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we assume in the following calculations , that @xmath23 of the accretion luminosity of magnetic cvs is emitted in the hard x - ray component . to the first approximation",
    ", the bremsstrahlung temperature of this component is defined by the depth of the gravitational component on the wd surface , the observed values showing considerable dispersion . for a large sample of magnetic wds @xcite",
    "we calculate the average value of @xmath24 kev with the standard deviation of @xmath25 kev . in the following calculations we assume @xmath26 kev and",
    "ignore the dependence of the temperature on the wd mass .",
    "as demonstrated below this particular choice does not influence our results significantly .    in order to constrain the contribution of magnetic cvs to the cn frequency",
    "we compute their predicted x - ray luminosity assuming that cne are exclusively produced in such systems . in this calculation",
    "we assume that the presence of strong magnetic fields does not influence the characteristics of nuclear burning and results of @xcite for the mass of the hydrogen layer @xmath27 apply .",
    "in particular , we used the @xmath27 values for the wd temperature of @xmath28 k @xcite .",
    "the total accretion luminosity predicted by equation ( [ eq : cn_lbol ] ) is halved ( see above ) , corrected for interstellar absorption , and converted into the 210 kev energy band .",
    "the obtained value is then compared with the observed luminosity of the unresolved emission , corrected for the contribution of accreting wds , as described before .",
    "the upper limit on the contribution of magnetic systems in the cn rate in m31 is shown in fig.[fig : polars ] .",
    "it shows that allowing all possible values of the wd mass , no more than @xmath29 per cent of cne can be produced in magnetic systems . the less constraining value of the upper limit corresponds to the largest accretion rate and most massive wds .",
    "however , the combination of these extreme parameters is not typical for magnetic cvs as illustrated by the cumulative distribution of the wd mass in magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the distribution shows that @xmath30 per cent of white dwarfs are less massive than @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore the average accretion rate in these systems is fairly low , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we conclude therefore that a more realistic upper limit should be @xmath33 per cent , corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this result weakly depends on the assumed temperature of bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "if @xmath36 kev is assumed , the upper limit becomes @xmath37 per cent .",
    "only unrealisticly large temperature of @xmath38 kev would lead to a two times larger upper limit .     to match the number of non - magnetic ones .",
    "the data , used to produce this plot , is given in table [ tab : cne].,width=330 ]      @xcite find that @xmath39 of cne , with known progenitors , are produced in cvs possessing a magnetic white dwarf ( table [ tab : cne ] ) .",
    "although this catalogue is not complete neither in the volume nor in the brightness limited sense , the @xmath40 times discrepancy appears to be too large to be consistent with our upper limit of @xmath33 per cent . in another study , @xcite investigated the space density of magnetic and non - magnetic cvs , and obtained that @xmath41 per cent of all cvs are magnetic .",
    "this number also seems to be in conflict with our upper limits .",
    "as demonstrated below , these two discrepancies are caused by the single reason  by an order of magnitude difference in mass accretion rate between magnetic and non - magnetic system .",
    "indeed , the average accretion rate in magnetic cvs is @xmath42 @xcite , whereas for non - magnetic cne it is @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the obvious consequence of this difference is that in magnetic systems it takes longer to accrete the same amount of material needed to trigger the nova explosion .",
    "moreover , at lower accretion rates @xmath44 is larger by a factor of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the consequence of these effects is that magnetic cvs undergo cn outburst @xmath46 times less frequently .",
    "this explains the second discrepancy  between the observed fraction of magnetic cvs and our upper limit on their contribution to the cn frequency .",
    "another consequence of the smaller accretion rate is that cn explosions are brighter in magnetic systems , therefore they can be observed at larger distances and are sampled from larger volume than cne from non - magnetic progenitors .",
    "this explains the first discrepancy  seemingly too large fraction of cn events which progenitors are magnetic systems . to verify this , we selected cne with known progenitors from the catalogue of @xcite and searched for distances in the literature . in total",
    ", we collected 32 cne , of which 11 are from magnetic progenitors ( table [ tab : cne ] ) .",
    "their distance distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : novadistr ] . obviously , magnetic systems are located at larger distances : the average distance is @xmath47 kpc and @xmath48 kpc for magnetic and non - magnetic cne . below @xmath49 kpc almost four times more non - magnetic cne are observed ( the normalized number of magnetic systems is @xmath50 and @xmath51 for non - magnetic ) , whereas above @xmath52 kpc there are more magnetic cvs ( @xmath53 vs @xmath54 ) .",
    "the difference between two distributions is statistically significant , with the k - s probability of @xmath55 .",
    "the difference in the distance can be compared with the prediction based on the expected brightness at the maximum of the lightcurve .",
    "calculations of @xcite show that for @xmath56 wd the maximum brightness achieved during the cn explosion will differ by @xmath57 magnitude , the difference being smaller for a more massive wd .",
    "taken at the face value , this would suggest the distance difference of @xmath58 which is smaller than the observed difference in average distance by a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "given the crudeness of this calculation , we conclude that these two numbers are broadly consistent with each other .",
    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a subclass of cvs showing frequent quasi - periodic outbursts due to thermal - viscous instability of the accretion disk @xcite . in quiescence",
    "they become sources of relatively hard x - ray emission from the optically thin boundary layer , whereas in outburst state the optically thick accretion disk emits predominantly in the ultraviolet and soft x - ray bands .",
    "one of the models used to describe the emission spectra in quiescence states is a cooling flow model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "spectral analysis of a large number of quiescence spectra showed a relatively large dispersion in the value of the initial temperature @xmath60 kev with the average value of 23 kev @xcite .",
    "this value is assumed in the calculations performed in this section .",
    "it is also assumed , that only half of the accretion energy is emitted in the boundary layer .",
    "dwarf novae give rise to cne . on the other hand , in the quiescence state they may contribute to the unresolved emission . in the outburst state , to the opposite , soft emission",
    "is largely hidden because of the interstellar absorption .",
    "therefore the bimodal spectral behavior of dwarf novae can be used to constrain the fraction of mass which is accreted in quiescence , similar to how the upper limit on the contribution of magnetic systems was obtained . using same approach we calculate the x - ray luminosity in the quiescence state assuming that dwarf novae are responsible for a @xmath21 of cn events ( the other half is due to nova - like variables , @xcite ) . with this value",
    "one can put an upper limit on the fraction of mass , accreted during quiescence .",
    "the result of this calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dnluminosity ] . as in the case of magnetic systems ,",
    "the absolute upper limit is @xmath40 per cent .",
    "however , the wd mass in dne typically does not exceed @xmath61 and the mass accretion rate is not much larger that @xmath62/yr , therefore the realistic upper limit is @xmath33 per cent . as before , this result is not strongly sensitive to the choice of @xmath63 parameter of the cooling flow model . assuming @xmath64 kev our upper limits would increase by @xmath65 of their value .    using this upper limit ,",
    "the enhancement factor of the accretion rate in outburst state can be inferred .",
    "obviously , this quantity depends on the fraction of time spent in the outburst . since for majority of dne it is smaller than @xmath66 @xcite , the accretion rate increases by @xmath67 during outburst .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with observations of dwarf novae .",
    "indeed , one of the best studied dwarf nova , ss cyg , spends @xmath68 per cent of the time in quiescence @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate varies from @xmath69 in quiescence @xcite to @xmath70 in outburst @xcite , hence the enhancement factor is @xmath71 and @xmath72 per cent of the material is accreted in outburst periods , in good agreement with our results .",
    "although we considered only the bulge of m31 , our results can be generalized to other early - type galaxies .",
    "the x - ray to k - band luminosity ratio in early - type galaxies , galaxy bulges , and in the milky is in good agreement in the @xmath73 kev band ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* present work ) . on the other hand , for a sample of early type galaxies , including m31 , @xcite .",
    "obtained fairly uniform values of the luminosity specific nova rate ( @xmath74 ) , in the range of @xmath75 . in apparent contradiction with this , we obtain @xmath76 for the bulge of m31 , based on its cn frequency and k - band luminosity .",
    "however , @xcite computed the k - band luminosity from ( b  k ) colour and b - band luminosity of the galaxy , which in case of m31 results in by a factor of @xmath5 larger k - band luminosity than the 2mass value , and by a factor of @xmath77 larger than deduced from the spitzer data @xcite . with this correction",
    ", our value for the k - band specific cn rate for the bulge of m31 corresponds to @xmath78 , which is in a good agreement with other galaxies .",
    "as both x / k ratio and @xmath79 are similar , our conclusions hold for other early type galaxies .",
    "we studied unresolved x - ray emission from the bulge and disk of m31 using publicly available _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ data .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ survey of m31 covered the entire galaxy with the total exposure time of @xmath80 after filtering .",
    "_ chandra _ data covered the bulge and the southern part of the disk , with the exposure time of the filtered data of @xmath81 .",
    "we demonstrated that unresolved x - ray emission , associated with the bulge of the galaxy , extends into the disk with similar x - ray to k - band luminosity ratio .",
    "we obtained @xmath82 in the @xmath73 kev band for all studied regions in the bulge and the disk of m31 , which is in good agreement with those obtained for the milky way and for m32 .",
    "this suggests that the unresolved x - ray emission in m31 may have similar origin to the galactic ridge x - ray emission , namely it is a superposition of a large number of faint compact sources , such as accreting white dwarfs and coronally active binaries .",
    "we investigated x - ray emission associated with the 10-kpc star - forming ring based on _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "we characterized this emission with @xmath83 ratio , where @xmath84 is calculated for the @xmath85 kev energy range .",
    "we found that its value is spatially variable . after excluding the two regions along the minor axis of the galaxy , which are likely contaminated by the hot gas outflow",
    ", we obtained values ranging from zero to @xmath86 .",
    "the origin of these variations remains unclear .",
    "we derived constraints on the nature of classical nova progenitors based on the brightness of unresolved emission .",
    "we demonstrated that magnetic cvs  polars and intermediate polars , do not contribute more than @xmath5 per cent to the observed cn frequency , assuming values of parameters most likely for the cn progenitors , the absolute upper limit being @xmath87 per cent .",
    "we also showed that in dwarf novae @xmath88 per cent of the material is accreted during outbursts , and only a small fraction during quiescent periods .",
