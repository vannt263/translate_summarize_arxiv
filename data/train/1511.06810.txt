    "a purpose of this paper is to construct characteristic classes of fiber bundles which are not necessarily principal bundles whose structure group is a finite - dimensional lie group .",
    "the difficulty is that a diffeomorphism group , which is considered as the structure group for a general fiber bundle , is very huge compared to a finite - dimensional lie group .",
    "an idea to overcome the difficulty is a ` linearization ' which means to replace the diffeomorphism group @xmath0 for the fiber @xmath1 with the automorphism group of the tensor algebra of the first homology group @xmath2 . a main tool is the maurer - cartan form of the space of expansions which was originally considered by kawazumi @xcite in the case of free groups .",
    "diagrammatically , the construction is as follows :        in this paper , for any fiber bundle @xmath3 whose structure group satisfies a certain condition , choosing a fiberwise metric , we construct a chain map from the chevalley - eilenberg complex to the de rham complex on the base space @xmath4 via a flat @xmath5-connection , and show that the induced map on cohomology groups is independent of the choices .",
    "moreover , we show that applying the construction to a closed surface bundle , our construction gives morita - miller - mumford classes .",
    "the similar construction of morita - miller - mumford classes of 1-punctured surface bundles was previously given in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare our construction to a different approach on diffeomorphism groups with noncommutative geometry in lott @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce tools for construction of characteristic classes . the notions defined in subsection 2.1 and 2.2 is used in section 3 , and johnson maps defined in subsection 2.3 is in section 4 . in section 3.1 and 3.2",
    ", we construct characteristic classes under different two conditions of fiber bundles . in subsection 3.3",
    ", we clarify the relation between characteristic classes constructed in subsection 3.1 and 3.2 . in subsection 3.4",
    ", we describe these characteristic classes by lie algebra cohomologies of lie algebra of derivations . in section 4 ,",
    "we prove that our characteristic classes of a closed surface bundle give morita - miller - mumford classes .    * acknowledgment . *",
