    "consequently , if gas density is high enough and the temperature low enough , the characteristic cooling time will be less than a hubble time @xcite .",
    "this cooling gas should `` flow ''",
    "quasi - hydrostatically onto the cd / d galaxy at the bottom of the cluster potential well .",
    "typical mass flows inferred from the x - ray data are @xmath19 m@xmath20 yr@xmath4 within the central @xmath21 kpc of the cluster .",

    "spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy has confirmed the presence of distributed cooling gas in clusters @xcite .",
    "as the gas cools rapidly through the @xmath24 k regime , it should emit strongly in certain uv resonance lines  particularly the ovi  1032,1038 doublet @xcite . finally ,",
    "as the gas cools to @xmath25 k , it should emit strongly in the hydrogen lines ( h@xmath23 , ly@xmath23 ) . optical h@xmath23 emission from cooling flows has been detected toward several clusters @xcite , @xcite has also reported extended ly@xmath23 emission from a number of clusters having h@xmath23 emission .",
    "emission lines from cooling flow gas at temperatures @xmath26 k have yet to be convincingly detected .",
    "@xcite observed several clusters , including a1795 , with the fuv spectrograph on the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ ( hut ) in an attempt to detect emission from ovi .",
    "no detections were made , although in the case of the strongest x - ray cooling flow cluster observed , a1795 , the hut exposure time was only 2000 sec . in efforts to detect gas at temperatures of @xmath27k",
    ", a number of investigators have attempted to detect the fex  @xmath16374 coronal line in cooling flow clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided the the most sensitive search reported to date , and found no evidence for the line and set an upper limit for the surface brightness of @xmath28 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "emission lines from fexvii  arising in gas at @xmath30k have also not been detected in a recent _ xmm _ observation of a1795 @xcite .",
    "detection of emission from gas at @xmath31 k would provide the lynchpin to physically connect the previously detected hot and cool gas components in the cores of clusters .",
    "we have therefore begun a program with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( fuse ) to search for emission from ovi  1032,1038 in the cores of the x - ray bright , cooling flow clusters a1795 , a2199 and a2597 .",
    "results for a1795 and a2597 are presented in this paper .",
    "fuse has twice the effective area of hut at ovi  @xmath11032 , which , when coupled with longer integration times and higher spectral resolution can provide a considerable increase in sensitivity over the hut .",
    "for example , the fuse observations reported here for a1795 are a factor of 15 more sensitive than the hut observations .    throughout this paper",
    ", we have used a value of @xmath32 km  s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 .",
    "all distances scale as the inverse of @xmath33 , while observed line luminosities and derived cooling flow mass deposition rates scale as @xmath34 .",
    "far - ultraviolet spectra of the cores of a1795 and a2597 have been obtained with the fuse observatory .",
    "a description of the fuse instrument and its in - orbit performance is described in papers by @xcite and @xcite . in brief ,",
    "fuse spectra cover the wavelength range @xmath35  with a spectral resolution of @xmath36 km  s@xmath4  ( depending on wavelength ) for point sources .",
    "fuse spectra are recorded in four separate optical channels , two of which employ lif optics covering the wavelength range @xmath37and two which use sic optics covering the @xmath38  range .",
    "dispersed light is focused onto two photon - counting microchannel plate detectors .",
    "all observations were carried out with the lwrs spectrograph entrance aperture ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "for extended emission which fills the lwrs aperture , the instrumental line width is @xmath21 km  s@xmath4 , which is narrower than the expected line width of cooling flow gas in the core of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "the data were processed with the fuse calibration software ( _ calfuse _ , version 1.8.7 ) .",
    "since the signal from the source is expected to be weak , extra care was taken in subtraction of the detector background .",
    "photons events with pulse heights less than 4 or greater than 15 were screened out of the data , since these events are predominately background in nature .",
    "furthermore , the standard background subtraction employed by _ calfuse _ , which is adequate for bright objects , was not used . instead",
    ", the background level on each detector was determined from a co - addition of all exposures for each cluster .",
    "the local background in the vicinity of the expected line positions was measured on the 2d spectral image at locations just above and below the spectra , and were then subtracted from the extracted spectra .",
    "we have searched the extracted spectra for emission from ovi  @xmath11032 and ciii  @xmath1977 .",
    "ovi  @xmath11032 is redshifted to 1097  and 1117  in a1795 and a2597 respectively .",
    "these wavelengths fall in the lif channels for both detectors 1 and 2 , and for the sic channel in detector 2 ( for a1795 only ) , and is outside the wavelength range of the sic channel in detector 1 .",
    "the combined effective area of the 2 lif channels at @xmath40 , based on in - flight calibrations , is about 52 @xmath3 .",
    "the sic2 channel at this wavelength has an effective area of only @xmath41 @xmath3 , and hence we have not used the sic2 spectrum in our analysis . the ciii  @xmath1977 line is also redshifted to a wavelength covered by both lif and sic channels .",
    "however , the combined effective areas of the lif channels is much greater than the sic channels , and given the fact that the signal is close to the detector background , we have used only the lif spectra from channels 1 and 2 .",
    "terrestrial airglow lines in the far - uv @xcite have also posed a special problem in our search for emission lines from cooling flows .",
    "for example , in a1795 the ciii  @xmath1977 line is redshifted to 1038.7 , which is adjacent to an oi  airglow line . in a2597 ,",
    "the ciii  line is redshifted to 1057.4 , which is potentially contaminated by a terrestrial n@xmath42 emission band .",
    "finally , in a1795 , the ovi  @xmath11032 line is redshifted to coincide with a band of niairglow lines .",
    "we have thoroughly investigated all these possible contaminations and discuss the results below .",
    "a1795 was observed on february 23 , 2000 with an integration time of 37,189 seconds .",
    "the cluster has a redshift of 0.0631 @xcite , hence the fuse aperture subtends @xmath43 kpc at the cluster .",
    "the spectrograph aperture was centered on the cd galaxy at coordinates : @xmath44 .",
    "any ovi  @xmath11032 emission from a1795 would be redshifted to an observed wavelength of 1097 , which is unfortunately at nearly the same wavelength as a complex of ni  terrestrial airglow lines @xcite .",
    "these lines are strong only when looking at the illuminated earth .",
    "however , they are also present in spectra taken near the earth limb , and are faintly visible throughout the daylit portion of the orbit . to avoid the effects of these airglow lines as much as possible , we have restricted our analysis of the ovi  line to data obtained during spacecraft orbital night , limiting the integration time to 17 ksec .",
    "the lif1 and lif2 spectra of a1795 were coadded and the resulting spectrum at the expected wavelengths of the redshifted ovi  lines is shown in figure 1 , where the data has been binned by 0.2  ( @xmath45 km  s@xmath4 ) . a faint continuum from the cd elliptical galaxy",
    "is detected at a level of @xmath46 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 @xmath4 , in good agreement with the uv continuum flux reported by @xcite at wavelengths @xmath47  from an iue large aperture observation .",
    "this relatively large far - uv flux from an old elliptical galaxy at a redshift of 0.0631 indicates the presence of substantial star formation activity .",
    "@xcite has estimated an ongoing star formation rate of @xmath48 m@xmath20 yr@xmath4 from the iue data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have reported broad - band uv emission from the center of a1795 , and concluded that a population of early type stars is present , which presumably formed from the cooling flow .    in figure 1 , we note possible galactic absorption lines of h@xmath42 at 1094 and 1100 , which makes the spectrum appear somewhat noisier than it truly is .",
    "these absorption features do not correspond to any metal absorption lines at the redshift of a1795 . in any event",
    ", there is no obvious oviemission .",
    "after subtracting a continuum fit to the galaxy spectrum , we compute a flux in the @xmath11032 line of @xmath49 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , where we have integrated from @xmath50 to @xmath51 km  s@xmath4 about the expected line center .",
    "the uncertainty quoted here is purely a random error .",
    "there is also a systematic uncertainty in the continuum placement , so we estimate a 2@xmath52 upper limit to the flux in @xmath11032 line of @xmath8 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , or in terms of the average surface brightness within the fuse lwrs aperture , @xmath53(ovi)@xmath54 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 arcsec@xmath29 or equivalently , @xmath55 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 .",
    "this then yields an upper limit to the luminosity in the ovi  @xmath11032 line of @xmath56ovi@xmath57 erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "we have have also searched the a1795 spectrum for ciii  @xmath1977 emission using the full 37 ksec integration taken during both orbital night and day . in figure 2 , we display the @xmath58  spectral region from that dataset",
    ". the background subtraction appears to be quite good , since the cii  @xmath11036 absorption line from the galactic interstellar medium is black at line center , as expected .",
    "a faint emission line appears to be present adjacent to the oi  @xmath11039.2 terrestrial airglow line , and we suggest that this is emission from ciii  @xmath1977 in the cooling flow of a1795 , redshifted to 1038.7 .",
    "the line flux is uncertain due to the airglow contamination , but we estimate a flux of @xmath59 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ; ie . only a @xmath60 detection .",
    "we also note broad absorption extending from @xmath61  to 1037 in the observed frame .",
    "absorption at the two ends of this range are due to ovi  @xmath11032 and cii@xmath11036 from the galactic ism .",
    "the absorption at 1034  corresponds in wavelength to redshifted ly@xmath62 in a1795 .",
    "absorption by neutral hydrogen in a1795 could , in principle , be confirmed by detecting ly@xmath63 absorption .",
    "however , ly@xmath63 is redshifted to 1090 , which is very near the edge of segment b of detector 1 , where calibration is problematical .",
    "this wavelength is not recorded on detector 2 , since it lies in the gap between segments a and b.      a2597 was observed on june 26 , 2000 for a total integration time of 43,032 seconds .",
    "the spectrograph aperture was centered on the cd galaxy at coordinates : @xmath64 .",
    "the redshift of the a2597 cd galaxy is 0.0823 @xcite , thereby shifting the ovi  @xmath11032 line to to 1116.86  in the observed frame .",
    "this is in a region of the spectrum where there is no observed or expected airglow emission @xcite .",
    "we have therefore used spectra obtained during both orbital day and night in our analysis of a2597 .",
    "the co - added spectrum from the lif1 and lif2 channels is shown in figure 3 , binned to 0.2 . a weak , but clearly detected emission line is evident at the expected position of redshifted ovi  @xmath11032 .",
    "the emission line is clearly visible in both the individual lif1 and lif2 spectra , so it is very unlikely to be due to a detector artifact .",
    "indeed , no such emission feature is observed at 1117  in the combined day and night ( 34 ksec ) observation of a1795 .",
    "we therefore conclude that this weak emission line is redshifted ovi  @xmath11032 from the cooling flow nebula of a2597 .",
    "we measure a flux in the @xmath11032 line of @xmath65 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , where we have integrated from @xmath50 to @xmath51 km  s@xmath4 about the expected line center .",
    "the fuse aperture subtends @xmath66 kpc at the cluster , resulting in an average surface brightness within the fuse lwrs aperture of @xmath53(ovi)@xmath67 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 arcsec@xmath29 or equivalently , @xmath68 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 .",
    "the luminosity in the ovi  @xmath11032 line is then @xmath56ovi@xmath69 erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "an examination of the spectrum has also revealed an emission line at 1057.4 , the expected position of redshifted ciii  @xmath1977 ( see figure 4 ) . @xcite",
    "have observed emission from terrestrial n@xmath42 at this wavelength when pointed at the bright earth . in order to determine",
    "if the observed line in our data is terrestrial in origin , we have also extracted spectra of a2597 obtained during orbital night .",
    "although the night - only data was restricted to 14 ksec , the emission line at 1057  is detected quite easily .",
    "furthermore , the flux in the line is the same during the night and daylit portions of the orbit .",
    "finally , we note that there is no emission line at this wavelength present in the a1795 spectra .",
    "we conclude that the evidence is strong that the emission line at 1057  is not of terrestrial origin , and is in fact redshifted ciii  @xmath1977 from a2597 .",
    "the measured line flux is @xmath70 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 measured within @xmath71 km  s@xmath4of the expected line center .",
    "the flux in the ovi  line is a function of the temperature of the gas , its distribution in the cluster , and the mass flow rate in the cooling flow . @xcite and @xcite have computed the expected luminosities of ultraviolet emission lines from a gas cooling from a temperature @xmath72k to @xmath6k .",
    "the luminosity in the ovi  line is given by    @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the mass flow rate , @xmath75 is the mean mass per atom , @xmath76 is the abundance of oxygen , @xmath77 is the fraction of oxygen in the o@xmath78 ionization stage , @xmath79 is the number of particles per h atom , @xmath80ovi ) is the volume emissivity in the ovi  line , and @xmath81 is the radiative cooling function @xcite .",
    "the gas cools from t@xmath82 down to t@xmath83 with an evolution that could be isobaric , isochoric or some combination of the two ; @xmath84 is 1 for isobaric cooling and 0 for isochoric . the intracluster medium ( icm )",
    "has abundances that are typically @xmath85 times solar @xcite which can be understood in terms of the icm being composed of galactic ejecta mixed with primordial gas .",
    "note in the above equation that lower metallicity ( of oxygen in the present case ) is offset by a similar decrease in the cooling function , assuming that the abundance of oxygen is not dissimilar to other metals providing the bulk of the cooling .",
    "hence , the line luminosity is rather insensitive to metallicity , as first pointed out by citetcowie81 .",
    "we also note that the assumption made here is that this is the luminosity of an optically thin , extended region , with no self - absorption . @xcite",
    "have calculated uv line luminosities for solar abundances , with t@xmath86  k and t@xmath87  k. @xcite arrive at very similar results . adopting an intermediate case between isobaric and isochoric cooling ,",
    "the predicted luminosity in the ovi  @xmath11032 line is @xmath88 erg  s@xmath4 , where @xmath89 is the mass cooling flow rate in solar masses per year . for an optically thin plasma , the luminosity of the 1038  line is half of that of the 1032  line .",
    "based on model prediction above , our upper limit to the observed luminosity of a1795 in the ovi  @xmath11032 line implies an upper limit to the mass cooling flow rate of only @xmath90 m@xmath20 yr@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite determined the mass flow rates in a large sample of clusters observed with the _ einstein observatory _ and exosat , using a deprojection analysis of the x - ray images .",
    "for a1795 , they found a mass deposition rate of @xmath91 yr@xmath4 within a radius of @xmath92 kpc .",
    "@xcite computed mass flow rates for a sample of 30 of the most luminous x - ray clusters , by applying a similar deprojection technique to rosat hri images , and analyzing spatially resolved spectra of the clusters obtained with asca . within a cooling radius of @xmath93 kpc , @xcite finds a spectroscopic mass flow rate of @xmath94 yr@xmath4 .",
    "however , deprojection of the rosat images yielded @xmath95 yr@xmath4 . a deprojection analysis including intrinsic absorption using the same column densities determined from the spectral analysis of the asca data yielded a corrected value of @xmath96 yr@xmath4 .    in the generally adopted cooling flow picture , gas begins cooling from a temperature of @xmath97k at several hundred kpc from the cluster center , and cools as it flows inwards with @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the integrated mass deposition rate interior to @xmath100 .",
    "for a1795 , the fuse aperture has an effective radius of @xmath101 kpc , or @xmath102 as determined by @xcite . assuming a mass deposition rate proportional to radius , then the x - ray mass cooling rate within the fuse aperture is @xmath103 yr@xmath4 depending on whether one adopts @xmath104 , @xmath105 or @xmath106 from @xcite .",
    "our upper limit to the mass cooling flow rate of @xmath107 yr@xmath4 from the non - detection of ovi  @xmath11032 emission is about half of that derived from the asca x - ray spectra , assuming no absorption of the ovi  line .",
    "the observed ovi  @xmath11032 luminosity in a2597 implies a cooling flow rate of @xmath108 m@xmath20 yr@xmath4 , based on the model described above .",
    "@xcite has derived a cooling rate for the ambient hot gas of @xmath109 yr@xmath4 within a radius of @xmath110 kpc from rosat hri x - ray images .",
    "the effective radius of the fuse aperture at the redshift of a2597 corresponds to @xmath111 kpc , or @xmath112 . scaling the mass deposition rate with radius",
    ", we then find an x - ray mass cooling rate within the fuse aperture of @xmath113 yr@xmath4 , which is almost 3 times the cooling rate of @xmath114 yr@xmath4 inferred from the the luminosity of the oviline .",
    "one possible way to diminish the observed ovi  emission is through scattering by dust . @xcite",
    "have reported the existence of significant amounts of dust in the cores of some cooling flow clusters , based on submillimeter observations .",
    "@xcite has investigated the ly@xmath23/h@xmath23 emission line ratios in cooling flow clusters , and found an average excess reddening , above the foreground extinction , of @xmath115 in the range @xmath116 .",
    "@xcite discusses the location of the dust in the cluster , and favors the idea that the bulk of the dust is in the extended cluster component , instead of embedded in the localized cooling flow region .",
    "an extended dust component was found to be in rough agreement with estimates of cluster extinction based on background galaxy counts @xcite , and is supported by the lack of a correlation between @xmath115 with @xmath74 in cooling flow systems .",
    "if this is the case , then regardless of the geometry of the cooling flow region , ovi  emission from the core of the cluster will have to pass through the dust in the outer cluster on its way to the observer .",
    "@xcite derived a value of @xmath117 for a1795 ( although take note of the large uncertainties , which are primarily systematic ) . assuming an upper limit to @xmath115 of 0.22",
    ", this translates into @xmath118 magnitudes of extinction in the far - ultraviolet , computed assuming a standard galactic dust extinction curve with @xmath119 .",
    "if we assume that all of this extinction arises in the outer cluster and scatters the ovi  emission , then our observed , extinction - corrected line luminosity is @xmath120ovi@xmath121 erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "this then raises the limit to the mass cooling rate to @xmath122 yr@xmath4 , which does not constrain the x - ray models . for a2597 ,",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath123 which would result in an extinction corrected mass flow rate derived from the ovi  observation of @xmath124 yr@xmath4 , which is in reasonable agreement with the x - ray derived mass flow rate within the fuse aperture , given the uncertainties in the actual extinction value .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that dust in the icm may be unlike galactic dust , and may have different extinction properties .",
    "indeed , it is clear that extinction properties are dependent upon the past processing history and environment in which the dust grains reside @xcite .",
    "however , extinction in the far - uv is dominated by small grains , and these would be subject to destruction in the hot icm by sputtering . in hot gas with density @xmath125 @xmath16 , a grain of size @xmath126 microns will be destroyed in @xmath127 yr @xcite .",
    "so , grains smaller than @xmath128 m in size would be destroyed in less than a hubble time unless the grains were near the outskirts of the cluster where @xmath129 @xmath16 . if intracluster dust at large cluster radii existed and had an extinction law like that of the small magellanic cloud ( ie . containing small grains ) , then the icm extinction could be @xmath130 mag greater at ovi  than it would if an average galactic law were assumed",
    ".    hot gas near the cluster center should be free of dust grains with sizes @xmath131 m due to sputtering .",
    "so , any clouds that condense out of the cooling flow should also be dust - free",
    ". however , the gas surrounding the central galaxies in many cooling flow clusters appears to be dusty @xcite .",
    "@xcite have reported significant depletion of calcium in cooling flow emission line regions , and this is generally attributed to dust depletion . in the core of a1795 ,",
    "@xcite have resolved a 7 kpc long dust lane , whose morphology matches that of the h@xmath23 emission . @xcite have also resolved an elongated dust lane southeast of the nucleus of a2597 , together with patches of dust near the cluster core .",
    "this dusty gas may have been stripped from a gas - rich galaxy passing through the cluster core , or it might be the remains of a merger of such a galaxy with the central cd galaxy . consequently , these dusty filaments may be very dynamic , and may form and be destroyed continuously throughout the life of the cluster . the effect of dust in the core of the cluster on ovi  emission would likely depend on its geometry and/or filling factor .",
    "if the dust were confined to optical emission line filaments having a small filling factor , then the the observed ly@xmath23/h@xmath23 emission line ratios could be altered by this dust , and yet the ovi  emission , which arises in the intercloud regions ( or at cloud interfaces ) , could suffer much less extinction than the optical emission lines .      the existence of magnetic fields in intracluster gas with strengths of order 1 @xmath53 g have been inferred from observations of faraday rotation of radio sources seen through the icm @xcite .",
    "tangled magnetic fields , or field lines that run perpendicular to the temperature gradient , can prevent thermal conduction in an ionized gas .",
    "recent x - ray observations of two clusters , a2142 @xcite and a3667 @xcite , by _",
    "chandra _ have revealed what appears to be central , cooler intracluster gas separated from the outer , hot gas by a very sharp density discontinuity . @xcite",
    "have pointed out that this sharp temperature discontinuity could not be maintained without a significant suppression of heat conduction .",
    "recent _ chandra _ x - ray images of the core of a1795 reveal an 80 kpc long filament of x - ray emission extending to the sse of the cd galaxy @xcite .",
    "there is a remarkable morphological similarity between this x - ray emission and the h@xmath23 emission .",
    "although the nature of the filament is unclear ( ie . a cooling wake , or ram pressure stripped gas from a moving galaxy , etc ;",
    "see @xcite ) there appears to be a direct physical relationship between the x - ray cooling gas and the optical emission .",
    "although not all of this filamentary structure is within the fuse aperture , the brightest parts of the filament near the cd galaxy are within the aperture ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "if the cool clouds in the filament are small enough , they will be destroyed by thermal evaporation in the hot , ambient gas , unless conduction is quenched by tangled magnetic fields .",
    "the existence of the filament may then indicate that conduction is ineffective in cooling the hot x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the absence of ovi  emission in a1795 , the rather weak ovi  emission in a2597 , and the absence of observed fexvii  lines in cooling flows @xcite could then be explained by the suppression of conduction .",
    "nevertheless , we do observe ovi  emission in a2597 at a level consistent with expectations from x - ray observations if we correct the ovi  flux for a reasonable amount of scattering by dust .",
    "we are then left to ponder why no x - ray emission has been detected by _",
    "xmm _ from gas with temperatures less than @xmath132k . a possible explanation is provided by turbulent mixing of hot and cool gas @xcite .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the inner regions of cooling flows are likely to be highly turbulent , with turbulent velocities of order @xmath21 km  s@xmath4 . assuming the presence of entrained cool clouds , any relative motion between the hot gas and the cool clouds will excite kelvin - helmholtz instabilities that will grow and create a mixing layer at the interface .",
    "the surface area of the cool material is increased dramatically by this turbulence , and allows efficient diffusion of energy between the hot and cool phases @xcite , resulting in a very short mixing time .",
    "the steady - state temperature of the mixed gas is intermediate between the hot and cool gas with a value of @xmath133 @xcite , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are , respectively , the cool and hot gas temperatures and @xmath136 is a factor of order unity , and depends on the ratio of the efficiencies with which hot and cool gas deposit mass and energy into the mixing layer . for the case",
    "we envision in cluster cooling flows , if cool gas at temperature @xmath137k and hot gas at temperature @xmath138k are mixed , then the intermediate gas temperature in the mixing layer will be @xmath139k .",
    "this gas is at the peak of the cooling curve , and would rapidly cool and emit ovi  @xmath11032 , while being too cool to emit the fexvii   x - ray lines .",
    "we have obtained far ultraviolet spectroscopy of the cores of the galaxy clusters a1795 and a2597 , in order to detect emission lines arising in cooling flow gas with temperatures of @xmath140 k. we do not detect ovi  @xmath11032 in a1795 , with a @xmath141 upper limit of @xmath142 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit to the mass deposition rate of @xmath143 yr@xmath4 within the central 28 kpc , assuming cooling models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we report a marginal ( @xmath60 ) detection of emission from ciii  @xmath1977 in a1795 .",
    "we have detected ovi  @xmath11032 and ciii  @xmath1977 emission in a2597 providing direct evidence linking the cool gas at @xmath6k with the ambient hot , @xmath5k gas .",
    "in collisional ionization equilibrium , o@xmath78 and c@xmath144 are formed at temperatures of @xmath145 k and @xmath146 k , respectively .",
    "the observed ovi  @xmath11032 line flux in a2597 is @xmath147 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 and corresponds to mass deposition rate of @xmath148 yr@xmath4 .",
    "the non - detection of ovi  @xmath11032 in a1795 could be due to scattering by dust , or to quenching of thermal conduction by intracluster magnetic fields , which prevents the gas from cooling below @xmath149k .",
    "a turbulent mixing model , together with some dust extinction , appears to adequately describe our detection of ovi  @xmath11032 emission in a2597 , while also accounting for recent _ xmm _ spectrosocopic results , which indicate a lack of fexvii  emission , and hence a lack of cooling flow gas at temperatures of @xmath150k .",

    "<S> emission from ovi  @xmath11032 was not detected in a1795 , with an upper limit of @xmath8 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , corresponding to a limit on the mass cooling flow rate of @xmath9 yr@xmath4 . </S>",
