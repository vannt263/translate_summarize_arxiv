    "motivated by the success of the newman - penrose(np ) method in investigating the perturbation of various black hole geometries , we thought that the application of this method to study the perturbation of the friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime may give some further insight into structure formation .",
    "one of the authors @xcite had used this formalism to study free maxwell and dirac fields in frw space . after setting up the notations below , we write down the perturbation equations in the next section and solve them .",
    "section 3 discusses the scalar perturbation , and the green s function as well as the lienard - wiechert type potential in closed space are found in the final section we discuss some consequences .",
    "writing the line element as @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath1 , we may devise the null tetrad to be @xmath2,n_{\\mu}=\\frac{a^{2}}{2}[1,1,0,0],\\ , m_{\\mu}=-\\frac{as}{\\sqrt{2}}[0,0,1,i\\sin\\theta]\\text{and}\\text{the}\\text{complex}\\text{conjugate}\\text { } \\bar{m}_{\\mu},$ ] to express the directional derivatives as @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 . also , the non - vanishing spin coefficients@xcite are given by @xmath6 , where the overdot and prime denote derivatives with the conformal time @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "we will also have to use the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "with the change of variables @xmath11 , we get @xmath12 , and @xmath13 looks the same as @xmath14 .    of the np quantities representing the curvature of the spacetime ,",
    "all the weyl scalers @xmath15 vanish in the homogeneous and isotropic frw background , and the non - vanishing background ricci scalers are given through @xmath16 in the work below , we just consider the closed universe with @xmath17 , as the other two , @xmath18 turn out to be analytic continuation of the same solution .",
    "now we look at the perturbation equations . in combination with the @xmath19 s that vanish in the background",
    ", we should take the unperturbed directional derivatives and spin coefficients for first order perturbation equations .",
    "then we can write the first order perturbed bianchi identities as @xmath20 where either the upper or lower signs are taken once at a time , the @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the source terms comprising the perturbed energy - momentum ; the @xmath23 s are related to the weyl scalars @xmath24 , with @xmath25 representing the gravitational or tensorial perturbations , @xmath26 representing the vectorial or vortical perturbations , and @xmath27 the scalar perturbations .",
    "the equations for the vectorial perturbations are the same as the maxwell equations discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is an interesting proposition that the vortical perturbations arise from the electrodynamic interaction between the maxwell and dirac fields .",
    "simlarly , the equation governing the scalar perturbation is the same as that of the conformally coupled massless klein - gordon field .",
    "there are @xmath28 degrees of gauge freedom in the problem as we have formulated , four relating to the general co - variance of general relativity and six corresponding to rotations of the tetrad frame as discussed in ref .",
    "these conditions can best be used to simplify the source term , but we will not be concerned with the sources in this work , and will only discuss the eigen - modes of these perturbations . inspecting eqs .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] and [ 2.2 ] ) , we see that all the perturbations are related to each other , in that one contributes to the other ; existance of any one single type of perturbation gives rise to all .",
    "eqs , ( [ 2.1 ] and [ 2.2 ] ) can be decoupled by operating on the former with @xmath29 and the latter with @xmath30 and adding the two .",
    "the result is @xmath31\\phi_{s}^{\\pm}=j_{s}^{\\pm}.\\label{2,3}\\ ] ] thus the variables are found to be separable .",
    "it is easy to establish the operational identity @xmath32 , and a similar one for @xmath13 . letting @xmath33 for the appropriate helicities , all the perturbation equations contained in eq .",
    "( [ 2,3 ] ) can be written in a master equation as as @xmath34\\phi_{p}=j_{p}.\\label{2.4}\\ ] ] changing the sign of @xmath35 together with the signs on the operator gives the equation for fields with helicity reversed .",
    "the eigenfunctions are separable , and we may write@xmath36 where @xmath37 are the angular part represented by the the spin - weighted spherical harmonics satisfying the @xmath38 the solution@xcite is @xmath39 , allowing us to identify the spin - weighted spherical harmonics as the spherical harmonics formed with the jacobi polynomial @xmath40 . it can easily be established that @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are just the usual spherical harmonics",
    ". these are normalized to give @xmath43 , and they form a complete set in that @xmath44(@xmath45)=@xmath46(@xmath45-@xmath45 ) .",
    "koornwinder@xcitedeveloped an addition formula for jacobi polynomials , and there is a generalized addition theorem for @xmath47 given in ref.@xcite , but we can devise a degenerate form for our purpose by noting that @xmath48 can depend only on the angle @xmath49 between the directions @xmath50 where @xmath51=@xmath52 .",
    "so , multiplying @xmath46(@xmath45-@xmath45)=@xmath53 on both sides by @xmath54 and integrating over the solid angle to find @xmath55 , we may write @xmath56    for the eigen - functions of @xmath13 we may substitute @xmath57 to separate the temporal part and write the operator @xmath58 giving the the radial eigen - equation @xmath59 that determines the eigen - functions to be @xmath60 @xmath61 is the normalization constant , and the parameters of the jacobi polynomials are chosen to make the function regular at @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite has proved the non - hermitian orthogonality of jacobi polynomials with general parameters . in our case , we find that @xmath63@xmath64 gives us @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "so @xmath66 .",
    "both the angular and radial functions satisfy the spin raising and lowering operations @xmath67 where the eigenvalues are @xmath68 . in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) , the upper signs lower the helicities while the lower sign raise it . also the eigen - values satisfy @xmath69 .",
    "some of the eigen - functions representing the various modes of perturbation are displayed in fthe accompanying figures .",
    "the scalar perturbations , ( [ scalar ] ) , represent the density perturbations .",
    "these give rise to the structures .",
    "( [ vector ] ) show the vectorial perturbations .",
    "thes are responsible for generating rotational or vortical effects on the perturbations . the next mode shown in fig .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) are the tensorial perturbation representing the gravitational radiation content .",
    "all these modes are inter - related ; e.g. , any scalar dennsity enhancement due to gravitational collaps generates a rotational component and induces the release of binding energy through gravitational radiation .",
    "let us look at the scalar perturbation in some greater detail . to solve the inhomogeneous equation with source , we can work out the green s function by writing eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) for @xmath70 with the delta function source : @xmath71g=\\frac{1}{\\sin^{2}r}\\delta\\left(\\eta-\\eta'\\right)\\delta\\left(r - r'\\right)\\delta\\left(\\theta-\\theta'\\right)\\delta\\left(\\phi-\\phi'\\right).\\label{3.1}\\ ] ] the temporal eigen - functions are @xmath72 , the angular are the spherical harmonics @xmath42 and the radial ones are the normalized and appropriately weighted gegenbauer polynomial @xmath73 .",
    "now we can immediately write down the eigen - function expansion of the green s function as@xcite @xmath74 firstly , the integral over @xmath75 can be done by the method of residues to give @xmath76 $ ] next , the addition theorem for spherical harmonics can be used to write @xmath77 is the angle between the directions @xmath50 .",
    "then we are left with @xmath78.\\\\   &   & \\times\\sum_{l=0}^{k}\\frac{2^{2l}\\left(2l+1\\right)\\ , l!^{2}\\,\\left(k - l\\right)!}{\\left(k+l+1\\right)!}\\left(\\sin r\\,\\sin r'\\right)^{l}c_{k - l}^{\\left(l+1\\right)}\\left(\\cos r\\right)c_{k - l}^{\\left(l+1\\right)}\\left(\\cos r'\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we may use the addition theorem for gegenbauer polynomials@xcite to replace the second summation with @xmath79}{\\sin\\rho}$ ] , where @xmath80 .",

    "( [ 3.3 ] ) , we can consider the potential @xmath85\\delta\\left[\\theta'-\\theta_{\\zeta}\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]\\delta\\left[\\phi'-\\phi_{\\zeta}\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]$ ] of a point scalar perturbation moving along the trajectory @xmath86 to find a retarded lienard - wiechert type potential .",
    "thus , @xmath87 @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "the integral over @xmath89can now be easily done to give @xmath90\\left[1+\\frac{d}{d\\eta'}\\rho\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]}\\right|_{\\eta'=\\eta-\\rho\\left(\\eta'\\right)},\\label{3.4}\\ ] ] where the variables are to be evaluated at the retarded time @xmath91 ; here , @xmath92=\\cos",
    "r\\,\\cos\\left[r'\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]+\\sin r\\,\\sin\\left[r'\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]\\cos\\left[\\beta\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]$ ] and @xmath93=\\cos\\theta\\,\\cos\\left[\\theta'\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]+\\sin\\theta\\,\\sin\\left[\\theta'\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]\\cos\\left[\\phi-\\phi\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]$ ] , with the primed co - ordinates being the location of the source that produce the potential at the un - primed location of the observer ; also the right hand side is to be evaluated at the retarded time . without loss of generality",
    ", we may simplify the notation by locating the observer at the origin , in which case @xmath92=\\cos\\left[r'\\left(\\eta'\\right)\\right]$ ] .",
    "again it can be easily checked that eq .",
    "( [ 3.4 ] ) reduces to the familiar form in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "in this work we have written the equations of perturbation of the frw space - time in newman - penrose formalism .",
    "we find that the tensorial , vectorial and scalar perturbations decompose into forms that reveal the spin content spin content very transparently .",
    "the perturbation modes are also inter - related , in that the presence of any one mode gives rise to the rest .",
    "the eigenfunctions of all these modes of perturbation can be solved in terms of appropriate spin - weighted spherical harmonics and radial functions of similar spin content .",
    "the scalar mode gives rise to the density perturbations that are responsible for the large scale structures .",
    "we are able to solve for the green s function of this mode , and the result reduces to the familiar form from classical electrodynamics in the limit to flat space . with the green s function , we should be able to solve for the potential driving the scalar perturbations .",
    "also , the scalar perturbation @xmath95 may be interpreted to represent the newtonian potential , as in the schwarzscild spacetime @xmath96 .",
    "the vectorial perturbation equations are the same as maxwell equations .",
    "so it is worthwhile to investigate the possibility that the vortical modes and the rotational effects on the large , and even small , scale structures could have their origin in electrodynamic interactions in very early universe .",
    "although the free dirac and maxwell equations have been solved in another work , it is also necessary to to incorporate the quantum corrections into the model .",
    "all the known massive particles are fermionic , so study of the dirac current and energy - momentum as well as their interaction with the maxwell field will reveal many features of structures .",
    "these and similar problems will be taken up in future work .",
    "regarding the tensorial perturbations , all that can be said at this moment is that they must represent the gravitational radiation content of the universe , and the gravitational waveforms radiated by the structures present in the universe .",
    "the perturbation equations , eq .",
    "( [ 2.1],[2.2 ] ) , show that source of any one mode of perturbation produces the other modes .",
    "so the whole picture will become consistent only in an integrated view .",
    "this work can be considered only as an initial phase .",
    "the lowest possible state on the with @xmath97 on the left , and @xmath98 on the right .",
    "the lower ones are for @xmath99 , with @xmath100 on the left and @xmath101 on the right .",
