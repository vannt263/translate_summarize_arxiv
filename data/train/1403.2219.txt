    "recent developments in observational techniques and theories reveal the potential significance of magnetic fields for stellar structure , evolution , and circumstellar environment . at present , the distribution of magnetic field strengths in massive stars from the zero - age main sequence to more evolved stages , which would shed light on the origin of the magnetic field , has not been systematically studied .",
    "our recent search for the presence of a magnetic field in the visually brightest early a - type supergiant hd92207 , using fors2 in spectropolarimetric mode , resulted in the discovery of a rather strong mean longitudinal magnetic field of the order of a few hundred gauss @xcite .",
    "the photometrically and spectroscopically variable bright a0 supergiant star hd92207 is of particular interest for spectropolarimetric studies .",
    "it has been monitored for several years in the @xmath0-strmgren system by @xcite and spectroscopically by @xcite , who found cyclical changes of the brightness and substantial profile changes for metal lines and at h@xmath1 , and suggested that the observed photometric and h@xmath1 line variations are the result of a corotating structure in the wind , which they considered to be in the star s equatorial plane .",
    "furthermore , their study of the line profile variations revealed clear pulsation - like structures , indicating the presence of non - radial pulsations ( nrps ) with a period of 27days , while the stellar rotation period is of the order of several months .",
    "@xcite measured linear polarisation in the spectra of this star on seven different nights , spanning approximately three months in time . for the continuum polarisation , the spiral - shaped wind density enhancement in the equatorial plane of the star suggested by @xcite was explored .",
    "importantly , the authors reported that the polarisation across the h@xmath1 line on any given night is typically different from the degree and position angle of the polarisation in the continuum .",
    "these night - to - night variations in the h@xmath1 polarisation are hard to understand in terms of the spiral structure that was considered for the continuum polarisation .",
    "recently , @xcite claimed that the discovery of a longitudinal magnetic field in fors2 data is spurious due to non - photon noise , more specifically due to small offsets in the parallel and perpendicular beams , or non - predictable instrument instabilities or flexures , evidenced by changes in the individual spectra . in all considerations of possible culprits playing a role in the magnetic field determination , bagnulo et al .",
    "explicitly exclude the role of intrinsic spectral variations , assuming the ideal case of a non - variable star , referring to harpspol observations obtained in 2013 . in this study",
    ", we present a careful inspection of the fors2 spectra used for the magnetic field determination in hd92207 in our previous work .",
    "we report on the detection of short - term variability in this object , implying that the assumption of an ideal case of a non - variable star can not be held .",
    "dates of spectropolarimetric observations and radial velocity measurements in the fors2 spectra of hd92207 . [ cols= \" < , > , < , > \" , ]     we have reassessed our magnetic field determinations , which we present in table  [ tab : mfs_meas ] .",
    "the first column gives the modified julian date at the middle of the exposure and in the second column , we list the magnetic field and its error determined by the usual linear regression method . in the following two columns we first show the @xmath2 value , which is an indicator for the quality of the assumed errors and the validity of eq .",
    "[ eqn : vi ] , and the magnetic field and its error determined from our monte carlo bootstrapping tests .",
    "these latter two indicators are described in detail below .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field was for all three epochs determined from data in the wavelength regions 32503957 and 39754855 , i.e.  we are not using h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , or caiih .",
    "in the measurements of @xcite , we also used the wavelength region beyond h@xmath3 , which explains the now larger errors .    before the linear regression",
    ", we performed a rectification of the @xmath5 spectra .",
    "this step was also performed in @xcite , which should be obvious from fig .  1 in that paper .",
    "for the rectification , we fit and subtract a line to the data .",
    "this is somewhat similar to one of the two methods proposed by @xcite , who fit a `` smooth function '' , which we assume is a low order polynomial .",
    "however , we do not see the need for a higher order than a linear fit .",
    "we also would like to note that only the slope of this line is relevant for the determination of the longitudinal magnetic field . as already discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : descr ] , the influence of the rectification on the magnetic field determination is well within the error bars .",
    "we are interpolating all fors2 spectra , leading to a spectral bin size of 0.1 , compared to the natural fors2 spectral bin size of 0.75 . this way",
    ", we are generating new data , which can not be treated as individual measurements .",
    "thus , we have to take a factor of @xmath6 into account when calculating the errors both for the standard linear regression and in the monte carlo bootstrapping analysis .",
    "this factor is not relevant for the determination of @xmath2 .    in the analysis of high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations , null polarisation spectra",
    "are frequently calculated to assure that no instrumental or data - reduction effects are present in the measurements of magnetic fields .",
    "they are calculated by combining the sub - exposures in such a way that the polarisation cancels out .",
    "our experience with the calculation of null profiles for fors2 polarimetric observations shows that they can not be considered as reliable indicators for the presence or non - presence of magnetic fields since the null profiles obtained by sorting the frames in different ways are different .",
    "also , signals in the null profile might be the result of combining data with significantly different signal - to - noise ( schller et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "@xcite suggest to calculate an `` external '' error bar for the magnetic field values determined in the linear regression by multiplying the internal error with the factor @xmath2 , where @xmath7 is the number of degrees of freedom of the system , i.e.  the number of spectral bins minus 2 , and @xmath8 is calculated from    @xmath9    where the sum spans over all spectral bins @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively are the longitudinal magnetic field and the instrumental polarisation determined from the previous linear regression , @xmath13 is the left hand term of eq .",
    "[ eqn : vi ] in spectral bin @xmath10 , and @xmath14 is the factor in front of @xmath11 in the right hand term of eq .",
    "[ eqn : vi ] in spectral bin @xmath10 .",
    "for the three data sets , we calculate the factor @xmath2 presented in table  [ tab : mfs_meas ] . for the first epoch the error seems to be very reasonable , while for the other two epochs we probably underestimate the errors by 17% and 7% , respectively .",
    "following the suggestion by @xcite , we also carried out monte carlo bootstrapping tests .",
    "these are most often applied with the purpose of deriving robust estimates of standard errors . in these tests , we generate 250000 samples that have the same size as the original data set ( 15866 spectral bins ) and analyse the distribution of the @xmath11 determined from all these newly generated data sets .",
    "the resulting distributions , which we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : boot ] , all show smooth gaussian profiles . from this reassessment",
    ", we conclude that our data reduction does not show any flaw .",
    "however , given the detected short term variability , the question of the presence of a magnetic field can not be answered without proper modeling of the impact of such a variability on the measurements of the magnetic field . high resolution spectropolarimetric observations obtained on a short time scale are urgently needed before any conclusion can be drawn .",
    "the main conclusion by @xcite on the discrepancies between their and our earlier determination of the longitudinal magnetic field seems to be a wrong relative wavelength calibration on our side , especially due to the impact of wavelength shifts when rotating the retarder waveplate .",
    "while the assessment of a potential influence of a wrong relative wavelength calibration seems to be correct , it is not plausible that this is actually an issue for the data from the first epoch , where the longitudinal magnetic field is detected .",
    "directly after the observations of hd92207 , we observed the hot massive star hd93843 close to the position of hd92207 , at the same air mass and with similar short exposure times .",
    "we do not find any distinct zeeman features for hd93843 and the determined longitudinal magnetic field is compatible with zero .",
    "hd93843 also does not show strong spectral variability on a short time scale , ruling out that spectral variability is introduced due to imperfections within fors2 .",
    "the same results are obtained from observations of @xmath15oph , with an exposure time of 0.2s . in the same night",
    ", we also observed the two of?p stars hd148937 and cpd@xmath16282561 @xcite .",
    "the measurement of a magnetic field of @xmath17 g in hd148937 using the same wavelength calibration is perfectly in line with earlier measurements by ourselves @xcite and @xcite , following the 7.032d period determined by @xcite . for cpd@xmath16282561",
    ", we find a magnetic field of @xmath18 g , which is supported by @xcite , who give a polar field strength larger than 1.7 kg for cpd@xmath16282561 .",
    "all these measurements indicate that there is nothing wrong with the wavelength calibration for that night .",
    "this still leaves room for a spontaneous instability in the fors2 wavelength calibration that affects the observations of hd92207 but no other object .",
    "while we can not rule this out , there is no evidence that could support this speculation in this or any other fors1/2 data set .",
    "another point raised by @xcite was that we could underestimate our magnetic field errors .",
    "we have used the mechanism to estimate the `` external '' error , as described by @xcite and can conclude that there is also no issue with the data in that respect .",
    "we also used the monte carlo bootstrapping tests proposed by @xcite , which indicate that we only slightly understimated our initial errors .",
    "we suggest that what @xcite claim to result from non - photon noise , most probably can be traced back to spectral variability of hd92207 on short time scales .",
    "the available fors2 polarimetric spectra clearly show the presence of short - term spectral variability , which was not previously discussed in the literature for any blue supergiant and certainly needs further investigation . in particular , a careful search for periodicity and identification of pulsation modes causing the remarkable changes in the line intensity and position on time scales of the order of minutes are urgently needed .",
    "with the current data , it can not be decided , if the variations are of periodic or stochastic nature . in any case , given the size of the supergiant , it is clear that the variability can not be referred to coherent line variations across the entire surface on such short time scales .",
    "obviously , seismic studies are of great importance to constrain physical processes in stars , e.g. differential rotation , mixing , mass loss , etc .. despite several decades of observational efforts with ground - based photometry and spectroscopy of bright blue supergiants , it is not yet certain what portion of their variability is periodic , or how far they deviate from strict periodicity . on the other hand , in the most recent observational studies of massive stars ,",
    "evidence is accumulating that some ba supergiants exhibit multiperiodic nrps . as an example",
    ", short - term variability was already identified on a time scale of 13hours @xcite . however , a variability on time scales of the order of minutes has not been detected so far , mostly due to the fact that telescopes with large collecting areas are needed for studies with spectral time sampling of a few minutes .    clearly , it is not possible to use the low - resolution fors2 spectra to model the effect of pulsations on the magnetic field measurements , and the potential of high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations should be used in the search of short - term variations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we need to note that due to the proprietary time of one year for eso observations , we are not yet able to study the spectral variability of this star in the high resolution harpspol spectra mentioned in the work of @xcite .",
    "the question how pulsations affect the magnetic field measurements is not yet solved in spite of the fact that the number of studies of pulsating @xmath3  cephei and slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars is gradually increasing . already in @xcite",
    ", @xcite discussed the influence of pulsations on the analysis of the magnetic field strength in the @xmath3  cephei star @xmath7  eri in musicos spectra and tried to model the signatures found in stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20 spectra .",
    "although the authors claim that using some modeling they are able to quantitatively establish the influence of pulsations on the magnetic field determination , they still detect profiles in stokes @xmath20 and @xmath19 that are the result of the combined effects of the pulsations and the inaccuracies in wavelength calibration that were not removed by their imperfect modeling of these effects .",
    "another important effect in the measurements of magnetic fields in pulsating stars , applying the lsd method to high - resolution polarimetric spectra , is that the line profiles belonging to different elements show different profile shapes and different displacements .",
    "the authors usually use essentially all metallic lines and he lines ( up to several hundred lines ) to calculate a `` mean '' lsd line profile , although the behaviour of lines of different elements during the pulsation cycle is frequently different ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "blue supergiants are considered as type  ii supernova progenitors .",
    "a careful study of their variability provides important diagnostic means for internal and atmospheric structure .",
    "the need for multiple modes to fit to the spectroscopic data sets has already been presented in several works analysing ba supergiants . according to the study of rigel by @xcite ,",
    "periods shorter than about a week can only be caused by the @xmath21-mechanism if other sources such as spots , variable winds , and propagating shocks can be excluded .",
    "the goal of future studies should be to search for the presence of short - term variability and periodicities in bright a0 supergiants with similar stellar parameters .",
    "moreover , since the short - term periodicity does not fit into the currently known domain of non - radially pulsating supergiants , its confirmation is of great importance for the models of stellar evolution .",
    "we are grateful to helge todt , who provided his monte carlo bootstrapping routines ."
