    "understanding of the symmetries of the electrons dispersion law in graphene is of crucial importance .",
    "actually , the symmetry classification of the energy bands in graphene ( or `` two - dimensional graphite '' ) was presented nearly 60 years ago by lomer in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "later the subject was analyzed by slonczewski and weiss @xcite , dresselhaus and dresselhaus @xcite , bassani and parravicini @xcite .",
    "recent approaches to the problem are presented in the papers by malard et al .",
    "@xcite , manes @xcite .",
    "different approaches to the symmetry classification are based on different methods of applications of group theory .    in our paper @xcite the labeling of the bands",
    "was based on compatibility relations and guesses . in the next publication @xcite",
    "we have shown that in the framework of the tight - binding approximation the representations of the little group in the symmetry points can be rigorously found in the framework of the group theory algebra .",
    "though the idea of using the tight - binding approximation is by no means new ( it was used already in the work by lomer ) , our approach is different , and , to our opinion , more convenient for applications .",
    "unfortunately , however well the subject is studied , there is always an opportunity to make a mistake .",
    "the mistake in our symmetry classifications of the bands at the point @xmath0 was pointed in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "motivated by that criticism , we reanalyzed the subject , found the source of the mistake and corrected it .",
    "this analysis , which is intended to be read together with ref .",
    "@xcite , we start the paper from . then we present classification of the electron bands in the most interesting points ( the corners of the brillouine zone ) considering space symmetry group .",
    "finally we show how the symmetry of the states changes under application of supercell potential .",
    "our tight - binding model space includes four atomic orbitals : @xmath1 .",
    "( notice that we assume only symmetry of the basis functions with respect to rotations and reflections ; the question how these functions are connected with the atomic functions of the isolated carbon atom is irrelevant . )",
    "we search for the solution of schroedinger equation as a linear combination of the functions @xmath2 where @xmath3 are atomic orbitals , @xmath4 labels the sub - lattices , and @xmath5 is the radius vector of an atom in the sublattice @xmath6 .",
    "a symmetry transformation of the functions @xmath7 is a direct product of two transformations : the transformation of the sub - lattice functions @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and the transformation of the orbitals @xmath10 .",
    "thus the representations realized by the functions ( [ tb ] ) will be the direct product of two representations .",
    "the hamiltonian of graphene being symmetric with respect to reflection in the graphene plane , the bands built from the @xmath11 orbitals decouple from those built from the @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "the former are odd with respect to reflection , the latter are even . in other words , the former form @xmath13 bands , and the latter form @xmath14 bands .",
    "the group of wave vector @xmath15 at the point @xmath0 is @xmath16 , at the point @xmath17 is @xmath18 , at the point @xmath19 is @xmath20 , at the lines constituting triangle @xmath21 is @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the representations of the group @xmath16 can be obtained on the basis of the identity @xmath23    we have found @xcite that at the point @xmath0 the orbitals @xmath11 realize @xmath24 representation , the orbitals @xmath25 - @xmath26 representation , and the orbitals @xmath27 - @xmath28 representation of the group @xmath16 . in eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) - ( [ c ] ) the first multiplier refers to the irreducible representations of the group @xmath29 , and the second multiplier refers to the irreducible representations of the group @xmath30 ( the character tables are presented in table [ table : d2 ] ) .",
    ".character table for irreducible representations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 point groups [ cols= \" < , < , > , > \" , ]     thus we obtain matrices of the irreps of the space group @xmath33 @xmath34 representation of any other operator belonging to the space group can be ontained using eq .",
    "( [ repr ] ) .",
    "in this note we also apply the group theory to analyze what happens at the points @xmath35 in graphene on a substrate with a perfectly commensurate superlattice potential , which has the same point symmetry @xmath16 as the graphene .",
    "we consider explicitly a @xmath36 superlattice , known as the kekule distortion of the honeycomb lattice @xcite . in this case",
    "the allowed translations in the space group are to the vector @xmath37 which being substituted into eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) gives @xmath38 .",
    "thus the representation of the translation operator in eq .",
    "( [ repr ] ) becomes @xmath39 in simple terms we may consider the brillouine zone ( bz ) of the superlattice as the folding of the original bz @xcite .",
    "the folding leads to the identification of the corners of the original bz ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) with the center @xmath42 of the new bz .    to study the fate of the dirac points ( at the fermi level ) we should consider @xmath43 representation as @xmath44 .",
    "we can forget now about space groups and decompose ( reducible ) representation of the group @xmath16 defined by the representations of its operators ( [ repr2 ] ) , ( [ repr3 ] ) with respect to the irreducible representations of the group .",
    "it is convenient to use equation @xmath45 which shows how many times a given irreducible representation @xmath46 is contained in a reducible one @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ ex ] ) @xmath47 is the dimensionality of the irreducible representation @xmath46 , @xmath48 is the number of elements in the group , @xmath49 is the character of an operator @xmath50 in the irreducible representation @xmath46 and @xmath51 is the character of the operator @xmath50 in the representation being decomposed .",
    "for the representation considered , the relevant characters are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 . hence representation of the group @xmath16 realized by the functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the reconstructed graphene",
    "can be decomposed as @xmath58 we see that due to supercell potential two degenerate dirac points disappear . at the point @xmath42 we have two merging bands realizing representation @xmath59 and another two merging bands realizing representation @xmath60 . in the vicinity of the point",
    "@xmath42 the dispersion law of each pair of bands is represented by a pair of isotropic paraboloids ( touching each other at the point @xmath42 ) .",
    "the folding of the bz , together with the destruction of previously existing dirac points , leads to appearance of the new ones .",
    "in fact , the new bz is still a hexagon , and the same symmetry arguments as were used for graphene can be used to explain appearence of the dirac points at the corners of the new bz ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , these new dirac points are situated deep below or high above the fermi level and , hence , less manifest themselves than dirac points of unreconstructed graphene .",
