    "the nature of dark matter is still unknown . it has been proposed that dark matter may be made of bosons in the form of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) at absolute zero temperature @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews and the introduction of @xcite for a short historical account of the development of the bec dark matter scenario ) . for dark matter halos ,",
    "newtonian gravity can be used so the evolution of the wave function of the self - gravitating bec is governed by the gross - pitaevskii - poisson ( gpp ) equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . by using the madelung transformation @xcite , these equations can be written in the form of hydrodynamic equations , the so - called quantum euler - poisson ( ep ) equations .",
    "these equations are similar to the hydrodynamic equations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) except that they include a quantum force arising from the heisenberg uncertainty principle and a pressure force due to the self - interaction of the bosons measured by their scattering length @xmath18 .",
    "quantum mechanics may be a way to solve the small scale problems of the cdm model such as the cusp problem , the missing satellite problem , and the `` too big to fail '' problem . in the bec model ,",
    "dark matter halos are stable equilibrium solutions of the gpp , or quantum ep , equations .",
    "they satisfy a condition of hydrostatic equilibrium corresponding to the balance between the quantum force ( heisenberg uncertainty principle ) , the pressure due to the self - interaction ( scattering ) , and the gravitational attraction .",
    "the mass - radius relation of self - gravitating becs at @xmath19 has been obtained numerically ( exactly ) and analytically ( approximately ) in @xcite for any value of the scattering length @xmath18 of the bosons .",
    "this study makes the link between the noninteracting case @xmath20 and the thomas - fermi ( tf ) limit @xmath21 in which the quantum potential can be neglected .",
    "it also treats the case of bosons with negative scattering lengths ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "when @xmath22 , the short - range interaction between the bosons is repulsive ( or absent ) . in that case , there is a stable equilibrium state for any value of the mass @xmath23 . , where @xmath24 is the planck mass .",
    "it is obtained from the klein - gordon - einstein ( kge ) equations @xcite . for self - interacting boson stars with a @xmath25 potential ,",
    "the maximum mass is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the dimensionless self - interaction constant ( see appendix [ sec_d ] ) .",
    "it can be obtained from the kge equations @xcite or from their hydrodynamic representation @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that , because of their superfluid core , neutron stars could actually be bec stars . indeed , the neutrons could form cooper pairs and behave as bosons of mass @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the mass of the neutron ) . by adjusting the value of the self - interaction constant , the maximum mass of these bec stars could account for the abnormal mass ( in the range @xmath30 ) of certain neutron stars @xcite that is much larger than the oppenheimer - volkoff limit @xmath31 based on the assumption that neutron stars are ideal fermion stars @xcite .",
    "] it corresponds to the balance between the repulsive quantum force , the repulsive self - interaction ( if any ) , and the attractive gravitational force .",
    "when @xmath1 , the short - range interaction between the bosons is attractive . in that case , there is an equilibrium state only for @xmath32 with @xcite : @xmath33 the stable configurations have a radius @xmath34 with @xcite : @xmath35 where the subscript @xmath36 means that @xmath37 is the radius containing @xmath38 of the mass ( the density profile has not a compact support but extends to infinity so the radius of the system is formally infinite ) .",
    "this equilibrium state corresponds to the balance between the repulsive quantum force , the attractive force coming from the self - interaction of the bosons , and the attractive gravitational force . for @xmath3",
    ", there is no equilibrium state anymore because the quantum force can not balance the attractive self - interaction and the gravitational attraction . in that case",
    ", nothing can prevent the collapse of the bec , not even quantum mechanics ( heisenberg uncertainty principle ) .",
    "therefore , the system is expected to collapse and form a black hole .    in the case of an attractive self - interaction , the maximum mass obtained in @xcite",
    "is usually extremely small .",
    "this is because it can be rewritten as @xcite : of the maximum mass of fermion stars @xcite , to the scaling @xmath39 of the maximum mass of noninteracting boson stars @xcite and to the scaling @xmath40 of the maximum mass of self - interacting boson stars @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the maximum mass given by eq .",
    "( [ intro3 ] ) is a newtonian result contrary to the other limits that come from general relativity .",
    "the usually very small value of the maximum mass ( or mass - radius ratio ) of self - gravitating becs with attractive self - interaction justifies _ a posteriori _ why a newtonian treatment is sufficient to describe them ( see appendix [ sec_vna ] for more details ) . ] @xmath41 similarly , the maximum radius can be written as @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the compton wavelength of the bosons . unless the self - interaction constant @xmath44 is extraordinarily small ,",
    "the maximum mass and the corresponding radius of self - gravitating becs with attractive self - interaction are much smaller than the masses and radii of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "this remark has important consequences .",
    "it has often been proposed , in connection to the bec dark matter model , that one possible dark matter candidate could be the axion @xcite .",
    "one reason is that , unlike the higgs boson , axions are sufficiently long - lived to coalesce into dark matter halos which constitute the seeds of galaxy formation .",
    "axions are hypothetical pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons of the peccei - quinn phase transition associated with a @xmath45 symmetry that solves the strong charge parity ( cp ) problem of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite",
    ". axions also appear in string theory leading to the notion of string axiverse @xcite .",
    "the axion is a spin-@xmath46 particle with a very small mass and an extremely weak self - interaction arising from nonperturbative effects in qcd .",
    "axions are extremely nonrelativistic and have huge occupation numbers , so they can be described by a classical field .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that axionic dark matter can form a bec during the radiation - dominated era @xcite .",
    "axions can thus be described by a relativistic quantum field theory with a real scalar field @xmath47 whose evolution is governed by the klein - gordon - einstein ( kge ) equations . in the nonrelativistic limit , they can be described by an effective field theory with a complex scalar field @xmath48 whose evolution is governed by the gpp equations .",
    "therefore , axions seem to be good candidates for the bec dark matter scenario",
    ". however , the axion has a negative scattering length corresponding to an attractive self - interaction .",
    "therefore , according to the results of @xcite , it is not obvious that axions can form dark matter halos of relevant mass and size .",
    "this can be checked by a simple numerical application .",
    "( [ intro1 ] ) and ( [ intro2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath49 @xmath50 considering standard axions with @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( the average density is @xmath54 ) .",
    "these values are `` ridiculously small '' @xcite as compared to the typical values of dark matter halos ( they rather correspond to the typical size of asteroids ) .",
    "obviously , standard axions can not form dark matter halos of relevant mass and size .",
    "however , they could form mini boson stars ( axion stars or dark matter stars ) of very low mass which are stable gravitationally bound becs .",
    "they might play a role as dark matter components ( i.e. dark matter halos could be made of mini axion stars ) if they exist in the universe in abundance .",
    "these mini axions stars could collapse into mini black holes of mass @xmath12 . in that case ,",
    "dark matter halos would be made of mini black holes ( their evaporation time @xmath55 is much larger than the age of the universe ) and behave as cdm .",
    "this conclusion only applies to the type of axions with attractive self - interaction that we have considered previously ( `` standard '' axions ) .",
    "axions with a repulsive self - interaction ( if they exist ) or axions with an attractive self - interaction , or no self - interaction , and an extraordinarily small mass could form bigger objects , possibly dark matter halos . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider that the smallest dark matter halo that we know , willman 1 ( @xmath16 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , is a pure bec without atmosphere . assuming that the bosons have a repulsive self - interaction and using the constraint @xmath58 set by the bullet cluster , we obtain @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see appendix d of @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that the bosons have no self - interaction , we obtain @xmath62 ( see appendix d of @xcite ) . finally , assuming that the bosons have an attractive self - interaction and using eqs .",
    "( [ intro4b ] ) and ( [ intro4c ] ) , we obtain @xmath63 , @xmath14 and @xmath64 .",
    "this is a new prediction ( especially the scattering length ) .",
    "these values reproduce the mass and size of dwarf dark matter halos . on the other hand ,",
    "the bullet cluster constraint is clearly satisfied .",
    "the values of @xmath2 and @xmath18 that we have obtained above may be revised by considering possibly more relevant dark matter halos than willman 1 but their orders of magnitude should be correct .",
    "therefore , it is not impossible that axions cluster into dark matter halos but , for that , their mass @xmath2 and scattering length @xmath18 need to have very different values from their `` standard '' values given previously",
    ". we shall call them `` ultralight '' axions .",
    "axionic dark matter halos made of ultralight axions could collapse into supermassive black holes of mass @xmath17 similar to those reported at the center of galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we study the collapse of a self - gravitating bec with attractive self - interaction ( e.g. an axion star or an axionic dark matter halo ) when its mass is larger than the maximum mass obtained in @xcite . to study this complex dynamics , we use in this paper a simple analytical model in which the collapse of the bec is reduced to the study of the motion of a particle in an effective potential @xmath65 , where @xmath66 represents the size of the bec . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the effective potential has no minimum so the particle descends the potential until the singular point of collapse at @xmath67 .",
    "this mechanical model , based on a gaussian ansatz for the wave function , was introduced in the context of self - gravitating becs in @xcite ( see @xcite for generalizations ) .",
    "this type of approximation is standard in the study of becs without self - gravity .",
    "it is known to give a good qualitative description of the evolution of the system but it is not always quantitatively accurate .",
    "therefore , it would be important to carry in parallel a numerical study based on the kge or gpp equations to compare our approximate analytical results to the exact numerical ones .",

    "two equilibrium states exist but only the configuration corresponding to the minimum of the effective potential is stable ( this is the state with the largest radius ) .",

    "therefore , if dark matter is made of standard axions , they could be in the form of mini black holes instead of mini axion stars .",
    "of course , our newtonian treatment is only valid as long as the radius of the star is much larger than its schwarzschild radius . when the radius of the star approaches its schwarzschild radius , general relativity must be taken into account in order to describe the formation of a black hole .",
    "however , we have shown in appendix [ sec_vna ] that general relativistic effects become important only extraordinarily close to the collapse time ( @xmath650 for standard axions ) so our newtonian treatment is justified .",

    "a similar phenomenon has been observed in the collapse of a ( nongravitational ) bec of ultracold atoms with an attractive self - interaction @xcite .",
    "the emission of relativistic axions could decrease the mass of the axion star so that it always remains larger than its schwarzschild radius .",
    "another possibility is that an axion star with @xmath3 loses mass by emitting scalar field radiation through the process of gravitational cooling @xcite . in this manner ,",
    "its core mass @xmath658 always remains smaller than @xmath202 , avoiding its catastrophic collapse into a black hole .",
    "an axion star with @xmath3 may also fragmentate into several pieces of mass @xmath659 .",
    "there is also the possibility of forming dense axion stars .",
    "the stable axions stars that we have considered in @xcite are dilute axion stars in which the self - gravity and the attractive self - interaction are balanced by the quantum force ( kinetic energy ) . as proposed by braaten _",
    "@xcite , there may exist dense axion stars in which gravity is balanced by the pressure of the axion condensate coming from higher order terms in the scalar field potential @xmath660 beyond the @xmath25 term .",
    "this leads to a sequence of new branches of axion stars .",
    "the first branch of these dense axion stars has mass ranging from about @xmath661 to about @xmath662 .    on a technical point of view , our study provides a lot of analytical results concerning the collapse , the explosion , and the oscillations of self - gravitating becs with negative scattering length .",
    "as already mentioned , our analytical results are based on a gaussian ansatz that may not always be quantitatively reliable .",
    "it would be therefore interesting to compare our analytical results with an exact numerical solution of the gpp equations .",
    "on the other hand , we have used a fully newtonian model although the system becomes relativistic at the end of the collapse , when it approaches the schwarzschild radius .",
    "therefore , one should solve the kge equations to have a more exact description of the dynamics .",
    "these are interesting problems for the future .",
    "however , the richness of the problem already revealed by our simple analytical study shows that the full numerical simulation of the gpp and kge equations , and their study , will require a considerable amount of work .",
