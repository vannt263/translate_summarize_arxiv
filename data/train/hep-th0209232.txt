    "after the success of k - theory in string theory , a standpoint that various d - brane configurations can be obtained by the open string tachyon condensation is established . this viewpoint is the third one to provide the description of d - branes , as well as the conformal field theory approach and the supergravity description . around this new possibility , there are two currents of study , one is the verification of sen s conjecture @xcite on tachyon condensation with use of string field theories , and another is to utilize this new description to describe off - shell dynamics of d - branes including time - dependent backgrounds and application to realistic braneworld models .",
    "our attempt in this note is oriented rather to the second point above .",
    "the aim of this note is to see how far we can proceed for constructing brane configurations as a defect of the tachyon condensation in string theory , by restricting our attention to the brane - antibrane configurations .",
    "it is known that , to obtain a desired brane configuration as a tachyon condensate , one has to prepare an appropriate number of non - bps branes from the first place .",
    "for example , if one wants to construct a solution of two parallel d - branes , one has to prepare at least two unstable branes of higher dimensional worldvolume .",
    "therefore the inter - brane interactions of the resultant defect branes are already encoded in the original non - abelian setup",
    ". then one can extract from the solution the off - diagonal interaction which corresponds to the excitation of the string connecting two branes , and it was found in @xcite that this excitation reproduces the lowest mass squared of the string excitation . , and off - diagonal modes in the sectors of the solitons ( lower - dimensional d - branes bounded ) reproduce the spectra of strings stretched between them . ]",
    "however , we will show explicitly that a solution representing brane and antibrane is possible in an abelian setup . since this brane - antibrane should be a kink - antikink ( or rather to say , wall - antiwall @xcite ) , this can be constructed by a simple abelian model with only one tachyon field .",
    "the intriguing aspect here is that non - abelian structure is expected to emerge from the abelian model .",
    "another motivation for the construction of the brane - antibrane solution in superstring tachyon models is to realize in string theory the outcome of the field theoretical analysis in non - linear sigma models , phenomenology with the extra dimensions , and braneworlds .",
    "in particular , brane - antibrane system breaks supersymmetries , which is phenomenologically preferable .",
    "we perform the fluctuation analysis of the constructed solution , and investigate how the spectra with supersymmetry breaking appears in the superstring tachyon model . in accordance to the recent development on the tachyon cosmology , we also study the time - dependent decay process of the brane and antibrane .    for concreteness we shall use the two - derivative truncation of the boundary string field theory ( bsft ) action @xcite for the field theory of the tachyon on the non - bps d - brane .",
    "section 2 provides a brane - antibrane solution of this theory , and in section 3 the force between the branes is estimated to suggest the off - diagonal string interaction . in section 4",
    "we study the fluctuation spectra and find supersymmetry breaking structure .",
    "section 5 gives the decay width of the brane and antibrane .",
    "conclusion and discussions are provided in the final section . in appendix",
    "a we find similar solutions exist also in the bsft with higher derivative corrections .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we use the two - derivative truncation of the bsft action of a non - bps brane @xcite , some of which are called minahan - zwiebach ( mz ) model @xcite .",
    "this kind of bsft model exhibits very interesting properties which are consistent with string theory . in particular ,",
    "exact classical solutions representing a d - brane exist , and they have appropriate ramond - ramond ( rr ) charges .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuation spectra around the soliton solutions are exactly solvable , and found to be consistent with d - brane spectra @xcite .",
    "the mz model action for a single non - bps d@xmath5-brane is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a function of @xmath8 which specifies the tachyon potential .",
    "for the action obtained by the derivative truncation of the bsft , we have @xmath9 in the action ( [ lag ] ) , for simplicity we ignored overall factor of the non - bps brane tension . in sec .  2 and 3",
    ", we neglect the dependence on the coordinate other than one world volume direction @xmath10 .",
    "the dimension of the tachyon field is appropriately normalized with @xmath11 .",
    "a characteristic point of this action is that the potential term @xmath12 is multiplied also on the kinetic term . for the bsft potential @xmath13 ,",
    "a perturvative vacuum @xmath14 is meta - stable , and there are two true vacua , @xmath15 .",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath16 provided that @xmath17 .",
    "it is known that the above lagrangian allows a very simple linear solution @xmath18 which represents a d@xmath19-brane , since according to sen s conjecture the kink solution which interpolates two vacua ( @xmath15 ) is a bps d - brane with codimension - one world volume .",
    "the location of the d - brane is determined by the equation @xmath20 , since the point @xmath14 is just the point between the two true vacua , and any kink solution should pass this mid point .",
    "therefore , the above single kink solution represents a bps d@xmath19-brane located at @xmath21 .",
    "it should be noted that another solution @xmath22 denotes an anti-@xmath23-brane , since the coupling to the rr gauge field @xmath24 gives negative contribution .",
    "therefore , if the solution passes zero of @xmath8 from negative to positive it represents a bps d - brane while if it passes in the opposite way it is an antibrane .",
    "let us proceed to obtain new solutions representing a pair of a brane and an antibrane .",
    "what we require for a solution of the brane and antibrane is that it satisfies the following properties :    * at both of the spatial infinities @xmath25 , t should be located at near one of the true vacuum : @xmath26 . *",
    "the equation @xmath20 with the solution @xmath8 should have two solutions for @xmath10 , which are the locations of the brane and the antibrane .",
    "@xmath27 has different signs at these zeros of the solution @xmath8 .",
    "let us find a solution satisfying these properties .",
    "in fact , it is possible to construct a general solution for the equations of motion ( [ eqm ] ) if we restrict our attention to a field configuration which depends only one direction @xmath10 . by multiplying @xmath28 on ( [ eqm ] ) ,",
    "the equation of motion is recast into the form @xmath29 this can be integrated by @xmath10 , and the result is @xmath30 thus we obtain a relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an integration constant parameter .",
    "one observes that the vanishing @xmath32 gives the simple linear solution ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "therefore this parameter @xmath32 is the one which characterizes the deviation from the bps single kink solution toward the brane - antibrane solution .",
    "the physical parameter of the brane and antibrane which is expected is the inter - brane separation , and we will relate this to the above @xmath32 . before going there , the following boundary condition will be found to be useful : @xmath33 then , for the case of bsft potential ( [ bsftpot ] ) , we have @xmath34 , and integration of the equation ( [ relation ] ) gives an explicit expression for the general solution : @xmath35 the bps limit is @xmath36 , though the above expression becomes meaningless in that limit .",
    "we will find later that this is because the brane and the antibrane are pushed out to the spatial infinities in this limit .",
    "here we shall show that the solution ( [ solution1 ] ) is actually a solution representing a brane - antibrane pair . in the following of this section and the next section ,",
    "we consider only the bsft potential @xmath37 for simplicity .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this does not lose any generality since the original system is invariant under @xmath40 and also translationally invariant .",
    "interestingly , the solution ( [ solution1 ] ) can be consistent only if @xmath41 .",
    "so let us study what happens around the critical point @xmath42 .",
    "for the tachyon field near the critical point the integrand in the solution ( [ solution1 ] ) seems to be dangerous because of a possible divergence . in order to check the behavior around the critical point",
    ", we expand the tachyon as @xmath43 where positive @xmath44 is taken to be infinitesimally small . then the integral",
    "is estimated as @xmath45 thus the integral is finite and has no divergence .",
    "this means that if we plot the solution in the @xmath10-@xmath8 space the solution is a curved line with a finite length , connecting @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the second term in ( [ solution1 ] ) is convergent for @xmath48 , thus there is the end of the base space at @xmath49 where @xmath50 how should this finiteness be understood ?",
    "one idea to interpret this strange property is to assume that the solution lives in a compact space , @xmath51 .",
    "if one assumes this , the size of the compactified dimension ( @xmath52 ) determines the parameter @xmath53 through the above equation .",
    "the other idea is that one can have a periodic solution , ends up with an infinite repetition of the solution . here",
    "the period is of course the same as the first case , @xmath52 .",
    "it should be noted that the solution @xmath54 has two zeros in the definition region @xmath55 .",
    "this is almost obvious since substituting @xmath14 in ( [ solution1 ] ) gives @xmath56 , because the integrand is symmetric under @xmath40 .",
    "the zeros of the tachyon profile represent the location of the d - branes .",
    "the tachyon potential @xmath57 has two vacua , @xmath15 , so there are two types of topological defects : a kink and an anti - kink , with regard to its orientation . in our case , @xmath58 is positive while @xmath59 is negative , hence our solution ( [ solution1 ] ) is actually a pair of a kink and an antikink .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this solution represents the brane - antibrane pair .",
    "the inter - brane separation is @xmath60 .",
    "we plot a numerical solution in fig .",
    "one can easily see that most part of the solution is linear , and the edge of the lines ( at @xmath61 ) are smoothly connected .",
    "the kink and the antikink are joined .",
    "( 10,60)@xmath10 ( -50,40)@xmath62 ( -100,130)@xmath8 ( -95,65)@xmath63 ( -95,-8)@xmath53    for the later purpose , we estimate the brane separation in terms of @xmath53 .",
    "suppose that we have very large @xmath64 .",
    "then the integrand in the solution ( [ solution1 ] ) is approximated by a constant in almost all the region of @xmath8 .",
    "this constant is actually given by the value at @xmath14 , as @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , we can estimate that in this large @xmath64 limit the brane separation @xmath60 can be given by @xmath67 therefore , approximately the brane separation @xmath60 is given by @xmath68 .",
    "summing up the above estimations , an approximate form of the solution for positive @xmath10 is given as @xmath69",
    "it is obvious that since this solution is a wall antiwall pair , the energy is reduced if the distance between the two approaches zero while the compactification radius fixed .",
    "however , these two parameters are related for the obtained solution , of course .",
    "the obtained configuration is meta - stable because the brane and the antibrane are located in an antipodal manner .",
    "the instability associated with the off - shell deformation of decreasing the inter - brane distance is the tachyonic instability which comes from the interaction between the two .    in string theory , naively this interaction mode is a closed string mode such as gravity and rr - interaction which are attractive force between the brane and the antibrane . however , from the first setup we neglected the closed string channel , so the appearance of the gravity interaction is hardly expected here .",
    "let us recall that the gravity and the rr interaction are arranged into the one loop amplitude of open string stretched between the two , if one sums up all the massive modes of closed strings .",
    "this is the s - t channel duality .",
    "now in the dual channel ( open string ) description , we prepared only the lowest modes ( tachyons ) , that is why we can not expect the reproduction of the gravity interaction .",
    "then , what is the interaction of branes in our case ?",
    "instead of the closed string interaction , we may expect only the lowest interaction of stretched open string .",
    "this is a massive state of the mass @xmath70 .",
    "the above argument shows that the inter - brane interaction is now dictated by the massive state with the mass @xmath70 , not by the gravity interaction .",
    "this should be seen in the solution constructed in this paper . for that purpose ,",
    "let us evaluate the potential between the branes . denoting the energy of the original single brane @xmath71 as @xmath72 , @xmath73_{t = x }   = 2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\ !",
    "dx\\ ; { \\rm e}^{-x^2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can evaluate the potential energy by an excess energy @xmath74 of the brane - antibrane configuration compared to twice of the energy @xmath72 of the single isolated brane , @xmath75 the multiplication factor 2 in the last term is necessary since we have two branes .    by using ( [ solution1 ] ) with @xmath39 , we change integration variable from @xmath10 to @xmath8 and obtain @xmath76 \\nonumber \\label{energy2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see that each term in the last line gives contributions of order @xmath77 with possible powers of @xmath53 . since the brane - antibrane distance is @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath79 here we have not determined the precise value of the integer @xmath80 ( this can be negative ) , since the important part is the exponential . if we regard this as a yukawa - type potential @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the typical mass of the particle which causes the interaction , we see @xmath83 up to a normalization . ,",
    "since the mass itself is expected to depend on the separation @xmath60 and in principle one can not extract the mass dependence only from the excess energy . ] here we see the appearance of a new mass scale @xmath70 .",
    "since the interbrane interaction should come from strings connecting the branes , this suggests that the typical mass scale for these strings should be of order @xmath70 .",
    "this is consistent with the string theory mass spectra .",
    "however , the string connecting the two propagates along the branes while the particle producing the potential ( [ yukawa ] ) propagates transversely .",
    "although this difference might be explained by the duality , precise reproduction of the corresponding string excitation is yet to be found .",
    "in this section we investigate the low energy effective field theories induced on the brane and antibrane .",
    "we do not consider the effective theories on each brane separately , since there exists weak interactions between the branes , as we have seen in the previous section . because of this weak interaction , the degenerate mass spectra on each brane resolves to form a fine structure .",
    "this resolution is actually due to the supersymmetry breaking , since a single brane ( a single wall ) itself is supersymmetric and is a bps state while the coexistence of the brane and the antibrane breaks the supersymmetry .",
    "since the inter - brane interaction as well as the supersymmetry breaking are exponentially suppressed as a function of the distance between the brane and antibrane , the resulting tower of boson and fermion spectra exhibits fine splittings .",
    "first let us derive the lagrangian for the fluctuation of the tachyon fields around the classical solution @xmath84 ( [ solution1 ] ) .",
    "we expand the field as @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the defect brane worldvolume coordinate , @xmath87 . substituting this expression to the original lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) and",
    "pick up the terms quadratic in @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath89 .",
    "\\label{flua}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here and in the following , @xmath90 is the function into which the classical solution @xmath84 is substituted . following the technique developed in @xcite",
    ", we make a field redefinition as @xmath91 then after a partial integration we obtain @xmath92\\hat{t } ,   \\qquad   v_{\\rm tachyon}({{t_{\\rm cl}}})\\equiv \\frac{{{\\cal k}}'''}{{{\\cal k}}'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , if we expand the fluctuation fields as @xmath93 in which the function @xmath94 solves the eigenvalue equations @xmath95 the corresponding mode @xmath96 has the mass @xmath97 , @xmath98    for the bsft potential ( [ bsftpot ] ) , @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 . therefore if one has a single d - brane solution as a background , the potential becomes harmonic and the schrdinger equation ( [ flucl ] ) becomes solvable , results in a spectrum with equal spacing .",
    "since we have two branes , there should be two almost massless modes as the low energy modes . among them",
    ", we may expect that there is a massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson coming from the breaking of the translational symmetry of the original system .",
    "the other modes should be tachyonic , since this scalar mode should be related to the inter - brane interaction which was shown to be a negative mode in the previous section .",
    "let us see this in more detail using the bsft potential ( [ bsftpot ] ) .",
    "in fact , the potential which fluctuation modes feel is the double - well type .",
    "the potential @xmath101 has two minima at the zeros of the solution @xmath84 , @xmath102 .",
    "if the inter - brane separation is large enough , we may expect massless ng modes for each brane .",
    "now , if the separation is not so large , these two ng modes are not really a ng mode , and they interact with each other .",
    "a basic knowledge on the quantum mechanics shows that the symmetric wave function is the true lowest mode while the antisymmetric wave function is the first excited level .",
    "thus we expect that this symmetric one is tachyonic and the antisymmetric one is the massless ng mode .",
    "the correct expression for the massless ng mode is well - known , @xmath103 it is easy to check that this satisfies ( [ flucl ] ) with @xmath104 , if we use the equations of motion for @xmath84 , ( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "and one can check that this ng mode is actually antisymmetric under the parity transformation @xmath105 . the expression ( [ solution1 ] ) of the solution shows @xmath84 is an even function of @xmath10 , thus its derivative @xmath106 is an odd function ( antisymmetric with respect to the double well potential ) .",
    "2 is the plot of the ng mode .",
    "one observes that the ng mode is almost flat , as is obvious from the expression ( [ ng ] ) and the fact that the solution ( [ solution1 ] ) is almost linear around the bottom of the potential .",
    "in fact , the single kink solution is a simple linear function @xmath107 , thus its ng mode is just constant . to describe in a different manner",
    ", we see that the potential for the fluctuation ( [ flucl ] ) is that of a harmonic oscillator for @xmath107 , thus the lowest mode is gaussian , @xmath108 .",
    "this shows that through the field redefinition ( [ redef ] ) the fluctuation @xmath88 is constant .",
    "the massless ng mode is an antisymmetric combination of the flat configuration , thus we expect that the tachyonic one is a symmetric combination , that is , almost constant everywhere .",
    "we do nt know the exact expression for that , however we can obtain an upper bound for its mass squared .",
    "first , from the potential @xmath109 , one can see that its mass squared should be greater than @xmath110 .",
    "second , since we know that it is the lowest mode of the schrdinger equation ( [ flucl ] ) , we can use the following inequality for any smooth function @xmath111 ( with appropriate boundary conditions ) @xmath112 from the observation above , we know that the true fluctuation is almost a constant function everywhere , thus a constant function is actually a good test function . substituting this with noting that one has to perform the field redefinition ( [ redef ] ) , one obtains @xmath113 using the equations of motion , the numerator of the right hand side reads @xmath114 where at the last equality we have used the relation ( [ relation ] ) . since this is negative , it is shown that the system admits a tachyonic fluctuation , as expected .",
    "this result can be derived without referring to the special form of @xmath115 ( [ bsftpot ] ) . only if the parameter @xmath32 in ( [ relation ] ) is non - zero ( not the bps limit ) , the above estimation gives a tachyonic fluctuation .",
    "the constant test function is a better approximation for a larger separation of the branes .",
    "therefore , the mass squared of this tachyonic fluctuation can be estimated in the large brane separation as @xmath116 for a very large separation of the branes , we can see that this state is nearly massless .",
    "if we take the bps limit ( @xmath117 ) , the above state becomes exactly massless , which is consistent with the fact that this limit is actually separating the brane and the antibrane to the opposite spatial infinities and turning off the inter - brane interactions to reproduce two sets of the spectra of a single bps brane .",
    "we will show later in sec .",
    "[ sc : susybreaking ] that the mass squared of tachyon ( [ evalu ] ) can also be obtained by means of the low - energy theorem associated with the supersymmetry breaking .    in terms of string theory , the possible interpretation of the tachyonic state with",
    "the mass squared ( [ evalu ] ) is given as follows .",
    "the matter content of the coincident brane - antibrane system consists of two transverse scalar fields @xmath118 and @xmath119 , two gauge fields and a comlex tachyon field @xmath120 .",
    "here we assumed for simplicity a single transverse direction .",
    "the tachyon field @xmath120 becomes massive if the brane separation is larger than the string scale .",
    "note that this massive tachyon field is not directly related with the tachyon fields which we have discussed , @xmath8 and @xmath88 .",
    "there is the following coupling between the scalar fields @xmath121 and the massive tachyon @xmath120 @xcite , @xmath122 since we are looking at the low energy excitation , the massive @xmath120 may be integrated out , then the above coupling gives a mass term for the linear combination @xmath123 . for the large separation ,",
    "the mass of @xmath120 becomes large , and the integration gives only small contribution , thus the mass generated from this term is expected to be very small .",
    "this is expected to give the expression ( [ evalu ] ) , since in the above coupling there appears the exponential , and the typical mass scale of @xmath120 is @xmath124 . on the other hand ,",
    "another linear combination @xmath125 has no coupling like above , therefore the mass is not generated by the integration and remains massless .",
    "this remaining massless mode is identified with the ng mode in our fluctuation analysis , the antisymmetric combination of the flat configurations for @xmath88 .",
    "it is known that on the non - bps branes there are fermions which couple to the tachyon .",
    "the leading order fermion terms are given by @xcite @xmath126 , \\label{fermi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the yukawa coupling is supplied with @xmath127 in this subsection we adopt @xmath128 for definiteness .",
    "for the fermion spectrum in the tachyon solution background , we follow the analysis @xcite . performing the field redefinition @xmath129 and decomposing the fields and the gamma matrices as @xmath130 we have the schrdinger equation for @xmath131 as @xmath132 where the potential is given as @xmath133{\\partial}_x { { t_{\\rm cl}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the bsft potential ( [ bsftpot ] ) , @xmath134 .",

    "the massless modes satisfy the first order equations @xmath137 this is easily solved as @xmath138 .",
    "\\label{zerof}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the bsft potential ( [ bsftpot ] ) , we have @xmath139 , thus one can readily see that @xmath140 is localized on the brane located at @xmath141 , while the other massless mode for @xmath142 is on the antibrane at @xmath143 .",
    "the localized wave functions are almost gaussian , @xmath144 .",
    "one can show that the mass spectra of @xmath140 and @xmath142 are identical , except for the massless modes .",
    "suppose that we have a solution for @xmath140 in the eigen equation ( [ fere ] ) . then constructing a new function @xmath145 it is easy to show that this @xmath146 satisfies the @xmath142 eigen equation ( [ fere ] ) with the mass @xmath147 .",
    "this implies that for each eigen mode @xmath140 , there is an eigen state @xmath142 with the same mass , provided @xmath140 is not a zero mode ( then @xmath148 ) .",
    "the converse can be shown in the same manner , therefore we have degeneracy of the fermion spectra between @xmath140 and @xmath142 except for the massless modes .    since in our case",
    "the world volume is compactified , the wave functions are all normalizable .",
    "hence both of the zero modes ( [ zerof ] ) are consistent solutions .",
    "thus we conclude that the fermion spectrum contains one pair of zero modes and ( infinitely ) many pairs of massive modes .",
    "namely fermions are doubly degenerate on our non - bps brane - antibrane background even including massless modes .",
    "another way to see this degeneracy is as follows . for non - bps configurations ( @xmath149 ) the solution we obtained has",
    "a period @xmath52 , and satisfies @xmath150 hence this translation along @xmath10 gives an exchange @xmath151 .",
    "this provides an interesting relation between the eigen functions @xmath152 therefore it is a direct result of this relation that the spectrum is doubly degenerate .",
    "this argument is valid even for the massless modes .",
    "however , for the bps case ( a single d - brane solution ) , there is no periodicity and thus the degeneracy can not be observed in this way .",
    "in fact , the degeneracy is only for the massive modes in this bps case @xcite .",
    "one of the zero modes ( [ zerof ] ) becomes non - normalizable .",
    "it is possible to analyse the gauge fluctuation in the same manner .",
    "the lagrangian we consider is @xmath153 for the two - derivative truncation of the bsft , we have ( [ bsftpot ] ) @xcite .",
    "performing the same analysis given in @xcite leads to the following schrdinger equation @xmath154 where @xmath155 and the potential is given by @xmath156({\\partial}_x { { t_{\\rm cl}}})^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the important point is that the operator in the schrdinger equation can be recast into a form @xmath157 where the linear differential operator @xmath158 and @xmath159 are defined as @xmath160 these operators @xmath158 and @xmath159 are adjoint of each other with respect to the inner product for @xmath161 fields @xmath162 , as @xmath163 defining the eigen function @xmath94 as @xmath164 , we obtain from the expression ( [ rewre ] ) that the mass squared @xmath165 is positive semi - definite @xmath166 this implies that the massless mode should satisfy a linear differential equation @xmath167 from the last expression in ( [ d ] ) , this massless mode can be easily found as @xmath168 therefore we have found that the mass spectrum of the gauge fluctuations consists of one massless mode and massive modes , thus there is no tachyonic state .",
    "although there are massless modes for all sectors of the fluctuation ( tachyon ( scalar ) , fermion and gauge fields ) , a tachyonic mode exists only in the tachyon ( scalar ) fluctuation @xmath88 , as shown in ( [ evalu ] ) .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the supersymmetry is broken for our solution .",
    "the amount of the supersymmetry breaking is measured by the difference of the boson / fermion spectra , that is ( [ evalu ] ) for the bsft potential ( [ bsftpot ] ) .",
    "the massless mode of the tachyon fluctuation is the ng boson associated with the breaking of the translation invariance .",
    "analogously , the massless modes of the fermion fluctuation can be thought of as ng fermions coming from the breaking of the overall target space supersymmetries as follows .",
    "non - bps branes in superstring theory are unstable ( meta - stable ) and the associated tachyon @xmath8 develops a vacuum expectation value . to describe this tachyon condensation ,",
    "an effective field theory of tachyons away from @xmath14 has been proposed .",
    "since this field theory is originally a field theory on the non - bps branes , the supersymmetries are completely broken at @xmath14 and are realized only nonlinearly @xcite .",
    "this is the target space supersymmetries of @xmath169 dimensions . in the limit of tachyon condensation @xmath170",
    ", supersymmetry is recovered .",
    "if we have a linear solution ( [ linear ] ) of the effective field theory corresponding to a single bps brane , half of the supersymmetries is recovered and is linearly realized . on the other hand ,",
    "the brane - antibrane configuration breaks this recovered linearly supersymmetries .",
    "therefore we should have the ng fermion associated with the broken target space supersymmetries .",
    "let us elaborate the above consideration more precisely .",
    "the total configuration of the brane and antibrane breaks supersymmetries completely .",
    "the amount of supersymmetry breaking is measured by the mass squared of the tachyon fluctuation ( [ evalu ] ) .",
    "there is another way to observe this .",
    "the non - linearly realized supersymmetries of the original action with the fermions ( the sum of ( [ lag ] ) and ( [ fermi ] ) ) are given as @xcite @xmath171 therefore one can see that , for the linear solution ( [ linear ] ) , half of the nonlinear supersymmetries are restored to be linear supersymmetries .",
    "this shows that the kink is a bps d - brane . in our case ,",
    "near the branes @xmath102 the solution is approximated by a linear function @xmath172 ( [ approx ] ) , where @xmath173 . plugging this into the above supersymmetry transformation , we find that it is slightly broken by @xmath174 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the fluctuation spectra the tachyon mass squared is of order @xmath77 , as shown in ( [ evalu ] ) .",
    "( 0,60)@xmath10 ( -60,40)@xmath62 ( -100,130)@xmath175 ( -95,65)@xmath63    ( 0,60)@xmath10 ( -60,40)@xmath62 ( -160,40)@xmath176 ( -60,130)@xmath140 ( -150,130)@xmath142 ( -95,65)@xmath63    another consistency check can be made through the low - energy theorem associated with the supersymmetry breaking @xcite . since the linearly realized supersymmetry of the tachyon condensed vacuum ( @xmath15 ) is spontaneously broken by the brane - antibrane configuration , low - energy theorems apply for the coupling of the ng fermion .",
    "when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken , the supercurrent @xmath177 at vanishing momentum reduces to the ng fermion field @xmath178 @xmath179 where @xmath111 is the order parameter of the supersymmetry breaking and @xmath180 is the supercurrent for matter fields .",
    "the conservation of the supercurrent @xmath181 relates the matrix elements of ng fermion to that of the matter supercurrent .",
    "if we evaluate them between boson and fermion states of a supermultiplet , the matrix element of the ng fermion gives the effective three point coupling @xmath182 of the ng fermion with the supermultiplet of boson and fermion , whereas that of matter supercurrent gives the difference of squared mass @xmath183 between the boson and the fermion .",
    "the resulting low - energy theorem is @xcite @xmath184 the order parameter of the supersymmetry breaking @xmath111 is given by the energy @xmath185 of the background solution as @xmath186 .",
    "the effective three point coupling can be given by the overlap integral of the three wave functions in @xmath10 .",
    "if we take the massless fermion localized on the brane as the matter fermion , its superpartner is given by the boson localized on our brane which is approximately given by an equal weight superposition of the zero mode and the tachyonic mode as shown in fig .",
    "[ boson ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the ng fermion is localized on the antibrane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fermion ] .",
    "the three point coupling is given in terms of an overlap integral of the wave functions of the supermultiplet of the boson and fermion with the wave function of the ng fermion which can be efficiently evaluated by the single kink approximation @xcite .",
    "since the wave function of the ng fermion is localized at the antibrane and has an exponentially suppressed tail around the brane , the overlap integral is exponentially suppressed to give the order @xmath77 as a function of @xmath53 in agreement with our result of the direct evaluation of the tachyon mass squared in ( [ evalu ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the potentials for each fluctuation , @xmath109 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 , coincide with each other if the classical solution is that of the single brane , @xmath189 .",
    "therefore in the bps limit our result reproduces that of @xcite , however we note that in our computation the derivation of the potential does not refer to any particular expression of the solutions .    in sum ,",
    "if the solution deviates from the linear case ( @xmath107 ) , the potentials for each fluctuation differ , and generically the degeneracy of the boson / fermion / gauge fluctuation spectra is resolved . for any classical background solution one",
    "finds as fluctuations a massless bosonic scalar mode ( ng boson ) , two fermionic modes which are ng fermions , and a massless vector mode .",
    "since there is a tachyonic fluctuation , the obtained solution is meta - stable and decays by some quantum effect . in this section",
    "we describe how the constructed solution of the brane and antibrane decays",
    ". the most natural decay may be by approach of the brane and antibrane .",
    "as we noted , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the tachyonic fluctuation corresponds to the distance between the brane and antibrane .",
    "thus this decay mode is actually the rolling down of the potential hill of the tachyonic fluctuation mode . from the mass squared of it ( [ evalu ] ) ,",
    "one can write the potential around the vacuum as @xmath190 the rolling down of the potential hill starts from quantum fluctuation , and a quantum - field - theoretical treatment for this kind of decay has been known for years @xcite .",
    "quantum one - loop corrections to the potential gives an imaginary part , and that is regarded as a decay width of the system . in our case ,",
    "the world volume theory is @xmath191 dimensional , then the decay width for a unit worldvolume can be obtained by following the computation in @xcite as @xmath192 here we derived this for the case of odd @xmath19 for simplicity .",
    "@xmath193 is the tachyon mass which is now given by ( [ evalu ] ) , therefore the rough estimate of the decay width is @xmath194 this decay width describes the approaching of the branes to each other , as shown in fig .",
    "the size of the supporting domain of the deformed surface can be also estimated @xcite as @xmath195    for the brane and antibrane , there is another interesting decay mode .",
    "this is nucleation of a throat connecting the two branes @xcite .",
    "the decay starts with a quantum tunnel effect by the nucleation of the throat , and then the throat expands to sweep out the brane and antibrane .",
    "the decay width can be easily computed by use of the tension of the branes and the brane separation .",
    "the radius of the nucleated throat is given as @xcite @xmath196 where we used that @xmath197 is the brane separation .",
    "since the decay width is given by the action of the throat ( which equals the tension times the area of the throat ) ,    ( -200,0)@xmath198 ( -260,0)@xmath199 ( -330,0)@xmath198    @xmath200    therefore this is not a dominant decay mode if @xmath201 . when @xmath202 , this decay process is comparable with the first one ( gradual approaching ) .    for both decay modes , after the annihilation of the brane and antibrane , we will be left with an almost homogeneous tachyon vev @xmath203",
    "this is unstable and rolls down the original potential @xmath57 , and finally we will be led to the rolling tachyon phase @xcite .",
    "in this note we have constructed a classical solution representing a brane - antibrane pair in a compact spacetime , in the tachyon effective field theory known as minahan - zwiebach model .",
    "the force acting between the branes comes from the modes propagating between the brane and the antibrane .",
    "the mass of this mode is shown to agree with the excitation of the string stretched between the branes .",
    "fluctuation spectra for the tachyon field , the fermions and the gauge fields are obtained , and they are found to exhibit the supersymmetry breaking structure .",
    "there are two possible decay modes of this configuration , one is the approach of the branes to each other , and the other is the nucleation of a throat connecting the branes . it is shown that the former decay mode is dominant in our theory .",
    "although the tachyon effective theory considered here has many desirable properties , it may receive @xmath11 corrections in string theory , and there is no guarantee that the solution considered here survives .",
    "in fact , even for the linear tachyon profile of a single d - brane solution , the corresponding bsft action includes infinitely many higher terms . a discussion on this higher derivative treatment is briefly given in appendix a. however , we point out here that our solution is equipped with a property which coincides with the solution of full string theory  a conformal field theory construction of brane and antibrane given by a.  sen @xcite .",
    "there exists an exactly marginal deformation of the cft which is a form of @xmath204 where @xmath121 is a scalar field in two dimensional worldsheet theory @xcite , and @xmath205 is a deformation parameter .",
    "this deformation is linear around @xmath206 while @xmath207 around the turning point ( in our solution , around @xmath53 ) .",
    "since this deformation is exactly marginal , the configuration is a solution of full string theory at the tree level .",
    "therefore an optimistic view is that our solution is not far from the full solution .",
    "it is important to construct an off - shell formalism around this marginally deformed background .",
    "the brane - antibrane interaction in string theory should be dictated by the exchange of gravitons and rr gauge fields .",
    "however in our setup we neglected these closed string modes from the first place , thus we can not see this in the force estimation in section 3 .",
    "in one sense this was good for us since we wanted to see the open string off - diagonal mode .",
    "however for the precise description of the brane and antibrane the lack of gravitational interaction is fatal , and how the closed string effect is incorporated in the tachyon model should be studied , for the precise description of the decay for example .",
    "our brane - antibrane solution can be formed dynamically , if we start from an unstable homogeneous vacuum @xmath14 .",
    "if the tachyon starts rolling inhomogeneously , generically the direction of the rolling may differ in regions of the world volume , and a stack of brane - antibrane pairs may be formed .",
    "the time - dependent inhomogeneous decay of tachyon theory was recently studied by several people @xcite in various approaches . here",
    "again the inclusion of the closed string modes may be concern .",
    "we leave these issues to the future work .    * acknowledgment *    the authors thank the yukawa institute for theoretical physics at kyoto university , where a part of this work was done during the conference `` quantum field theory 2002 '' yitp - w-02 - 04 .",

    "n.  s.   is supported in part by grant - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , science and culture 13640269 .",
    "in the whole analysis in this paper , so far we have used the minahan - zwiebach model ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "although this model is field theoretically very interesting and shares common properties with string theory low energy behavior , from a strict point of view , it is just a derivative truncation of the bsft action @xcite and receives higher derivative corrections . in this section",
    "we demonstrate to what extent the examined properties of the brane - antibrane solution survives in the derivative corrections .",
    "the bsft action for the linear tachyon profile ( equivalently , neglecting the @xmath208 terms ) is given in @xcite as @xmath209 where @xmath210 we can solve the equations of motion in a similar way , by constructing a conserved quantity for the translational invariance , @xmath211 therefore , the redefinition of the constant @xmath212 leads to @xmath213 the mz model has @xmath214 .",
    "therefore the right hand side of the above equation is linear , @xmath215 it becomes zero at @xmath216 , and this indicates that the solution at @xmath14 for large @xmath64 becomes almost linear with slope @xmath217 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the bsft case , the right hand side has no zero ( see fig .",
    "the limit @xmath218 corresponds to @xmath219 .",
    "this means that , the slope @xmath220 at which @xmath14 ( the location of the branes ) is very large .",
    "this slope @xmath220 diverges if we take the bps limit @xmath221 , which is consistent with the previous analyses in the bsft .      as before",
    ", the estimation of the slope @xmath220 may lead to the evaluation of the brane - antibrane separation . in the asymptotic region of @xmath86",
    "we can approximate the right hand side of ( [ bsre ] ) as @xmath224 therefore for large @xmath64 , the slope at @xmath14 can be approximated by the solution @xmath225 since in this linear approximation the inter - brane separation @xmath60 is given by @xmath226 , we substitute @xmath227 into the above equation and obtain @xmath228 unfortunately , this means that the large @xmath64 does not corresponds to the large separation .",
    "hence our linear approximation is invalid .",
    "however , it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ bs ] that a similar oscillatory solution exists and exhibits periodicity .",
    "since we have not found a suitable limit of the parameters for the large brane separation , it seems to be difficult to see the structure of the supersymmetry breaking without performing explicit fluctuation analysis using the solutions , although it is obvious that the supersymmetry breaking occurs .",
    "we expect similar processes for the brane - antibrane annihilation .    though here we have considered only the higher derivative corrections of the form @xmath229 @xmath230 , inclusion of the terms with higher derivatives acting on t , such as @xmath231 , would be also important .",
    "the relevant action was analysed in @xcite , and it would be interesting by using the action in @xcite to see if the brane - antibrane solution survives also these corrections .",
