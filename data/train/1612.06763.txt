    "this paper is concerned with the analysis of dynamics of planar curved traveling interfaces for the thermo - diffusive model of flame propagation with stepwise temperature kinetics and first order reaction . in non - dimensional form ,",

    "the model  is by no means new and was used by several authors , predominantly due to its simplicity and mathematical tractability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our interest in ",
    ", however , is motivated by recent advances in understanding of overall effective chemical kinetics for hydrogen - oxygen and ethylene - oxygen mixtures .",
    "indeed , recent theoretical and numerical studies based on the detailed chemistry mechanisms revealed that the global activation energy @xmath8 for such mixtures appears to be high at low enough temperatures and low at high enough temperatures @xcite .",
    "these findings strongly suggest the conclusion that an improved description of combustion waves for hydrogen - oxygen and ethylene - oxygen mixtures can be achieved by employing the global one - step kinetics with an appropriately modified arrhenius exponent .",
    "moreover , to sharpen the physical picture one may consider the extreme situation where @xmath9 , for temperatures higher than some effective ignition temperature and @xmath10 for lower temperatures .",
    "the latter observation leads to model  , but now on entirely physical grounds .",
    "one of the principal features of the model  is that it admits a unique ( up to translations ) , one - dimensional traveling interface solution . by choosing @xmath11",
    "we ensure that the interface propagates with the speed one so that both temperature and concentration fields depend on a single variable @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the spatial variable and @xmath14 is time . the traveling interface solution is explicitly given by the following formula : @xmath15 and @xmath16 typical profiles of the traveling interface solution are depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : fr ] is very different from those arising in conventional thermo - diffusive combustion with the standard arrhenius kinetics at high activation energies .",
    "indeed , in the model considered here the reaction zone width is of order unity , whereas in the case of arrhenius kinetics the reaction zone is infinitesimally thin .",
    "this fact suggests that it is appropriate to refer to traveling interfaces for stepwise temperature kinetics as thick flames , in contrast to thin flames arising in arrhenius kinetics .",
    "the presence of one - dimensional traveling interface solution for the model  poses a natural question of interface stability in higher dimensions and , more generally , understanding the dynamics of a curved level set @xmath20 . from now on , the word _",

    ", the authors performed the linear stability analysis of planar traveling interface solutions for the system . it was shown that the stability picture depends dramatically on the value of the lewis number @xmath21 . specifically , two different instabilities were observed . for @xmath22 the system may exhibit only pulsating instabilities in certain parameter regimes .",
    "this type of instability of a traveling interface is characterized by time - periodic oscillations of the mean interface velocity and the shape of the interface .",
    "there also exists a critical value of the lewis number @xmath23 , given by @xmath24 such that a planar interface is linearly stable when @xmath25 and it is cellularly unstable when @xmath26 as shown in fig .",

    "we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "the spatio - temporal scaling in is natural for analysis of interface dynamics with infinitesimal deviation of the lewis number from the stability threshold .",
    "however , in many practical situations , it is of interest to consider the behavior of an interface when a relative deviation of the lewis number down from its critical value is small but finite . in this case",
    "the problem does not possess a convenient physical small parameter . since it is often desirable to analyze combustion interfaces that are initially almost planar ,",
    "the natural small parameter of a geometric origin is the curvature of the interface . to make the appropriate scalings precise ,",
    "let @xmath43 and suppose that for any @xmath44 the following assumptions hold : ( i ) the curvature of the interface @xmath45 ; ( ii ) the normal velocity of the interface @xmath46 . in particular ,",

    "note that in this case the slope of the interface is of order @xmath49 .",
    "given the scaling above , we find it most convenient to work with interface - attached coordinates .",
    "we assume that the level set @xmath20 is a sufficiently smooth curve @xmath50 .",
    "the interface is given by the position vector @xmath51 parametrized with respect to arclength @xmath52 at a current time @xmath53 .",

    "this system of equation is complemented by the conditions far ahead @xmath61 and far behind @xmath62 the interface , along with the continuity conditions on the interface @xmath63    in this paper we derive an asymptotic model for the dynamics of the interface associated with the scalings in and establish a strongly nonlinear dependence of the interface velocity on curvature and its derivatives .",
    "it is important to note that this model is substantially more nonlinear than the one associated with the scaling in . in this regard",
    ", the model based on scaling can be viewed as weakly nonlinear , whereas the model based on scaling is strongly nonlinear .",
    "we note that derivation of equation for dynamics of the diffusive interface under assumptions of this paper in the conventional thermo - diffusive model in high - activation - energy limit was performed in @xcite .",
    "our purpose in deriving a strongly nonlinear reduced model is multifold .",
    "first , direct numerical simulations of cellular instabilities using the full system of equations - require substantial computational resources . as follows from linear stability analysis @xcite , perturbations of the interface",
    "induce extremely slowly decaying tails in the temperature and concentration fields .",
    "thus even the simplest instability regime can be captured only in domains that are orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of the interface .",
    "second , the model allows to relate the geometric and material characteristics of the problem with a dynamics of the interface .",
    "finally , the nonlinear model is derived in this paper under the weakest assumptions on scalings that allows for the dimensional reduction .",
    "thus all other asymptotic model can be obtained from the present setup by introducing appropriate rescalings .",
    "note that our assumption that the interface is given by a graph of a function is made to simplify the presentation .",
    "this assumption is not essential to and , indeed , in certain parameter regimes , when an interface initially is a graph of a function , it fails this property at some point during the evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present a formal asymptotic procedure that is subsequently used in section 3 to obtain an asymptotic expression for the normal velocity of the combustion interface . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the properties of the reduced model and present its further simplifications . in section 5",
    "we present the results of numerical simulations of the reduced model . in two appendices ,",
    "we review some standard facts from differential geometry needed for derivation of the asymptotic model and provide the details of the computational setup .",
    "in this section , we outline the asymptotic procedure that gives approximate solutions of the system - for the scalings discussed in the preceding section . in particular , we set @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the curvature of @xmath50 in the unscaled coordinates .",
    "we now seek an asymptotic solution of - in the following form @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 correspond to planar interface solutions of - moving with velocity @xmath69 .",
    "we also note that the number of terms in the expansions is chosen so as to guarantee well - posedness of the linearized version of the resulting asymptotic model .    substituting the expressions into - , collecting terms corresponding to different powers of @xmath70 , and using the standard identities of differential geometry ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) , we obtain a recurrent system of ordinary differential equations for the temperature @xmath71 and concentration @xmath72 fields , respectively , for @xmath58 ( ahead of the interface ) @xmath73 and for @xmath60 ( behind the interface ) @xmath74 here @xmath75 and the right hand sides of the equations in - are given by the following expressions @xmath76 at @xmath77 , @xmath78 at @xmath79 , @xmath80 at @xmath81 , @xmath82 at @xmath83 .",
    "the governing equations are supplemented by the far - field conditions @xmath84 at @xmath85 and @xmath86 at higher orders .",

    "note that the interface @xmath87 corresponds to the level set @xmath20 and , therefore @xmath90    in the next section we derive an asymptotic expression for the normal velocity of the interface .",
    "the planar traveling interface solution of system of governing equations is given by @xmath91 for the temperature and by @xmath92 for the concentration .",
    "note that these equations are identical to - .    at order @xmath93 temperature and concentration",
    "are given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the first correction to the normal velocity then reads @xmath96 where @xmath97 one can easily verify that @xmath98 and the sign of @xmath99 is the same as the sign of @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is a critical lewis number defined in .",
    "this observation is precisely what can be expected from the linear stability analysis .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath102 the asymptotic behavior of the normal velocity can be adequately described by the following equation @xmath103 note that is linearly well - posed and requires no additional regularization .",
    "however , for @xmath104 , the equation is linearly ill - posed and must be regularized by retaining more terms in a relevant asymptotic expansion .",
    "these terms in the expansion of the normal velocity are given by @xmath105 at @xmath106 and @xmath107 at @xmath108 . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 are given by @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 note that we do not give the explicit expressions for higher - order corrections for either temperature or concentration profiles as the asymptotic procedure leading to these , although simple , is rather tedious .",

    "first , the terms quadratic and cubic in curvature have no influence on linear well - posedness of the problem .",
    "second , the coefficient @xmath111 is strictly positive for all relevant parameter values , which ensures linear well - posedness of .",
    "in this section we explore the properties of the asymptotic model , consider further simplifications of , and establish the relationship between and the model .",
    "recall that the asymptotic reduction of - to the equation of motion of the combustion interface was obtained in this work under the single assumption of the small interface curvature .",
    "the derivation did not impose any restrictions on values of the parameters of the problem , such as the ignition temperature and the lewis number .    since the smallness of the curvature is an ingredient , needed to derive any asymptotic interface model that effectively replaces -",
    ", the equation is the most general in this class of models .",
    "consequently , any other interface model can be obtained from by introducing an appropriate rescaling .",
    "we note that this asymptotic model is valid as long as the coefficients @xmath115 are not too large , that is , their product with a typical scale of curvature variations remains small .",
    "this is always the case during some initial stage of evolution for almost planar interfaces .",
    "therefore , the model provides most general asymptotic description of a combustion interface at least for some ( possibly short ) time interval . for longer times , the predictions of are not necessarily accurate , even if a solution of this problem exists globally in time .",
    "let us now discuss simplifications of model corresponding to certain parameter regimes .",
    "we will consider a situation when the interface position is given by a graph of the function @xmath118 defined in .",
    "since the model is based on the scaling introduced in , we obtain the following expressions in terms of the function @xmath48 for the quantities involved in : @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 we will consider two parameter regimes .    * regime i*. first , consider a situation when the lewis number slightly deviates from its critical value . to this end",

    "conclude that in the immediate vicinity of the stability threshold , terms that depend on higher power of the curvature in the evolution equation can be neglected .",
    "therefore , at least heuristically , in this region the model takes a particularly simple form @xmath147    in the next section we will compare the results of numerical simulations for the models , , and .",
