    "bhr  71 ( bourke  1995a , b ) is a well isolated bok globule located at @xmath0200 pc , which harbors a highly collimated bipolar outflow ( bourke  1997  hereafter b97 ) .",
    "the outflow is driven by a very young class 0 protostar with a luminosity of @xmath09 .",
    "this paper brings together new observations with existing observations to show that bhr  71 contains two embedded protostars with a separation of @xmath03400 au .",
    "each protostar is driving a molecular outflow seen in co , but only one appears to be associated with a substantial amount of circumstellar material .",
    "the observations suggest that bhr  71 may contain an embedded binary protostellar system .",
    "near - infrared observations were undertaken with the 128@xmath2128 hgcdte array camera iris on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "mounted at the f/36 cassegrain focus iris provided a field of view of approximately 100  with a resolution of 079 pixel@xmath3 .",
    "a 4@xmath24 mosiac at k@xmath4 ( 2.11 ) with 90  offsets between frames was obtained on 1992 february 15 , with an integration time of 200s / frame .",
    "a 3@xmath23 mosaic in the  @xmath1=1 - 0s(1 ) transition at 2.12  ( 1% bandpass ) with 80  offsets was obtained on 1993 january 11 , with an integration time of 60s / frame .",
    "standard data reduction was performed with the starlink figaro data reduction package .",
    "observations of the  transition at 230537.99 mhz were obtained with the 15-m swedish eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) during 2000 may .",
    "the backend used was an acousto - optical spectrometer providing a channel separation of 43 khz ( 0.055 ) over 2000 channels .",
    "the observations were performed in dual beam - switching mode with a beam separation of 1147 in azimuth .",
    "systems temperatures of 220  k were recorded during the observations .",
    "a small 13 point map with 30offsets about the position of the embedded source bhr  71-mm ( b97 ) was made , with an integration time of 60s / point .",
    "the beamsize at this frequency is @xmath023 .",
    "bhr 71 was observed by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) on 1996 august 19 as part of program dmardone .",
    "observations in the lw2 ( 5.08.5 ) and lw3 ( 12.018.0 ) bands were obtained with a field of view of @xmath090",
    ". full details of the observations can be found in van den ancker , mardones & myers ( 2001 ; see also myers & mardones 1998 ) .",
    "the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) was used to obtain images of bhr 71 at 3 and 6 cm ( 8.64 and 4.80 ghz respectively ) as part of program c368 ( wilner  2001 ) .",
    "observations were made on 1994 november 12 with the 6d configuration , observing both frequencies simultaneously with 128 mhz bandpasses .",
    "the data was reduced with miriad and imaged using natural weighting , resulting in beamsizes of @xmath02  at 3 cm and @xmath04  at 6 cm .",
    "full details can be found in wilner  2001 .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) images are shown in figure  [ fig - nir ] . the image is shown in ( a ) , and the narrowband 2.12  image in ( b ) . no continuum subtraction has been performed on the narrowband image .",
    "it is immediately evident by comparison of the two images that most of the non - stellar emission is due to the emission in the  @xmath1=1 - 0s(1 ) line .",
    "this is most likely due to shocks in the outflowing gas ( eislffel 1997 ) . in bhr  71",
    "the large scale co outflow lies at a pa of @xmath0165  ( b97 ) and so is well aligned with the near - infrared emission .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) emission in the iso lw2 band is overlayed on the   image in fig .",

    "two of the 7  sources appear to be located at the apexes of nir emission , strongly suggesting that they are associated with the emission .",
    " 1 \" ( hereafter irs1 ) lies at the apex of the reflection nebulosity seen also in the i band image presented by b97 , which is associated with the large blue - shifted co outflow lobe .",
    "irs1 is also co - incident with the position of the mm source bhr  71-mm , also known as iras 11590 - 6452 ( b97 ) .",
    "no such counterpart exists for source  2 \" ( hereafter irs2 ) , which is the weaker of the two sources at 7 .",
    "the fluxes for irs1 and irs2 in the iso lw2 ( 7 ) and lw3 ( 15 ) bands are listed in table  [ tbl - pos ] .",
    "irs2 is not seen directly at 2 .",

    "[ fig - nir](a ) is non - stellar , by comparison of its psf with stars in the same image .",

    "the position of the source at 3  cm is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - nir](b ) and is listed in the notes to table  [ tbl - pos ] .",
    "the free - free emission coincides with the position of irs1 and has a spectral index at centimeter wavelengths that is consistent with a flat or rising spectrum due to free - free emission , a signpost of protostellar origin ( rodrguez 1994 ) .",

    "hh  320 and hh  321 .",
    "their locations are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig - nir](b ) .",
    "the positions of the hh objects as listed in corporon & reipurth ( 1997 ) are incorrect ( p. corporon , private communication ) .",
    "as discussed below , the plate solutions for their  image have been redetermined and the positions of hh  320 and hh  321 remeasured .",
    "the correct positions , accurate to @xmath5 1 , are given in table  [ tbl - pos ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig - nir](b ) it can be seen that hh  320 is coincident with the nir emission associated with irs2 , while hh  321 is coincident with the nir emission associated with irs1 .    in figure  [ fig - outflow](a )",

    "[ fig - nir](b ) . indicated on this figure are the locations of the iso sources irs1 and irs2 ( unfilled squares ) .",
    "overlayed on the figure are contours of integrated  emission , with solid contours representing emission that is blue - shifted ( @xmath6 ) with - respect - to the cloud systemic velocity (  @xmath7 ; b97 ) , and dotted contours representing red - shifted emission ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the large scale co outflow mapped by b97 is evident as open blue- and red - shifted contours , orientated approximately north - south with irs1 lying between them . on scales larger than is mapped in the present  observations this outflow has a position angle of @xmath0165 .",
    "closed contours of blue - shifted emission peak at the position of hh  320 .    in figure  [ fig - outflow](b ) is shown the co  spectrum at the ( @xmath9,30 ) offset position ( hh  320 ) . the high velocity outflow wing emission at this position due to irs1 ( red - shifted ) and irs2 ( blue - shifted ) is clearly seen .",
    "in order to determine accurately the iso positions and the relative positions of the centimeter source and hh objects it was necessary to register the images to the same spatial system .",
    "first , a plate solution for a 40  fov digital sky survey ( dss ) image centered on bhr  71 was determined by comparison with 25 stars from the _ hst _ guide star catalog ( gsc ) . using both the corrected dss image and the gsc , plate solutions for the i band image and the  image ( corporon & reipurth 1997  kindly provided in digital form by p.  corporon ) were determined , using 14 stars common to all three bands .",
    "the uncertainty in positions measured from these frames is believed to be @xmath51 , by comparison with the gsc and with each other .",
    "the plate solution for the nir images was determined using stars common with the i band image , 20 for the  image and 10 for the narrowband 2.12  image , respectively .",
    "finally , the iso 7  plate solution was determined using the three iso sources visible in fig .",
    "[ fig - nir](a ) and not associated with nir nebulosity .",
    "the positions of the hh objects were measured directly from the corrected  image , using the peak positions due to their non - symmetric shape .",
    "all positions quoted here are believed to be accurate to @xmath101 .",
    "the data presented here clearly indicates that two protostellar sources are present in bhr  71 , each driving its own molecular outflow . irs1 and",
    "its large - scale outflow has been discussed in detail by b97 .",
    "the spectacular shock chemistry in the outflow has been studied by garay  ( 1998 ) .",
    "b97 discovered extended 1.3 mm emission associated with irs1 and suggested that this is due to a massive circumstellar disk .",
    "irs2 has been noted previously ( myers & mardones 1998 ) .",
    "the data presented here shows that it is driving a compact co outflow and is associated with near - infrared molecular hydrogen emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig - outflow](a ) ) , which is coincident with hh  320 and most likely shock excited ( eislffel 1997 ) .",
    "earlier evidence for the blue - lobe can be seen in the channel maps of the irs1 outflow presented in b97 .",
    "their figure 6 shows the emission from the co  transition , and the outflow associated with irs2 can be seen in the velocity range @xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "comparison of the i band image and the irs1 outflow suggests that its blue lobe has broken through the near side of the globule ( b97 ) .",
    "the presence of hh objects in the blue lobe of the irs2 outflow suggests that this outflow is also penetrating the near side of the globule .",
    "the relative mass of the blue and red outflow lobes of irs1 suggests that the red lobe of the irs1 outflow has not penetrated the far side of the globule ( b97 ) .",
    "it is likely that irs1 and irs2 are located at a similar depth within the globule from the near side , and that their angular separation of @xmath017  is a good indication of their physical separation , which is therefore 3400 au for the assumed distance of 200 pc .",
    "the limited co observations do not reveal a red - shifted lobe to the irs2 outflow .",
    "due to the large inclination of the irs1 outflow to the line - of - sight , both blue- and red - shifted outflow emission is seen in the se part of the irs1 outflow ( b97 ) , which probably masks any emission from the red - shifted lobe of the irs2 outflow . however , the nir image shows a knot of  line emission , arrowed in fig .",
    "[ fig - nir](b ) , which is a possible counterflow to the irs2 blue - shifted outflow lobe . a line drawn from this knot through and extending past",
    "irs2 bisects the limb - brightened conical reflection nebulosity ( connecting irs2 and hh  320 ) at the base of the blue - outflow lobe of irs2 . taking this to define the outflow axis , the irs2 outflow has a p.a .",
    "of @xmath13 .    combining the irs2 co  data with the co data of b97 for irs2 allows for an estimation of the co excitation temperature , though the signal - to - noise of the latter data set is poorer , and the sampling grids are different .",
    "as no isotopic data are available , optically thin conditions are assumed , which implies  @xmath010 k. the mass of the blue - shifted emission in the irs2 outflow is @xmath00.004 , significantly less than the @xmath00.06  in the blue - shifted gas of the se lobe of the irs1 outflow ( b97 - using co  data and assuming optically thin conditions ) .",
    "the irs1 outflow is moderately optically thick ( @xmath14 ; b97 ) , so the optical depth of the irs2 outflow would have to be significantly greater to modify this comparison . although significantly less massive than the irs1 outflow , the irs2 outflow is still able to produce shock - excited emission and hh objects .",
    "previous observations by b97 show that irs1 is a class 0 protostar .",
    "compared to irs1 , irs2 is much weaker at 7  and drives a much less massive outflow , and is not detected at 1.3  mm (   [ sec - binary ] ) .",
    "this suggests that irs2 is more evolved than irs1 and is most likely a class i protostar .",
    "the presence of two sources in bhr  71 with a separation of 3400 au , neither detected at wavelengths @xmath5 7 , and both driving molecular outflows , suggests that a binary protostellar system has formed within the globule .",
    "observations by b97 show that strong 1.3 mm continuum emission is associated with the protostellar pair , but the emission is highly peaked on irs1 , and no obvious extension including irs2 is seen ( their figs .",
    "the lack of mm emission and the weakness of the 7  emission compared to irs1 suggests that irs2 is not surrounded by a significant amount of circumstellar dust .",
    "this situation is similar to that observed in bok globule cb230 ( launhardt 2001 ) .",
    "high - angular resolution observations ( @xmath02 ) of cb230 show compact mm emission associated with only one component of a nir protostellar pair separated by @xmath010 , suggesting that like bhr  71 only this component has a substantial circumstellar disk , though both protostars in cb230 drive co outflows . another wide binary protostellar pair , svs  13 ( bachiller et al .",
    "1998 ; separation 4300 au ) , shows mm emission from both protostars .",
    "kinematic information indicating a common center of gravity is required to show that a stellar pair is a binary .",
    "launhardt ( 2001 ) has also observed  emission ( 93.7 ghz ) from cb230 with a resolution of @xmath510  and found two cores with a separation of 10  ( 4500 au ) , each spatially coincident with a nir source , and which rotate about the axis perpendicular to the axis joining the cores .",
    "this implies that cb230 contains a true binary protostellar system .",
    "molecular line observations to date of bhr  71 ( b97 ) do not have sufficient angular resolution to determine if irs1 and irs2 are each associated with their own molecular core .",
    "though there are a similarities between bhr  71 and cb230  both contain 2 protostellar sources in a bok globule , each driving a co outflow , and large scale mm emission is centered on only one of the sources ",
    "bhr  71 can only be considered as a candidate binary protostellar system until high - angular resolution molecular line observations become available .",
    "new near - infrared and  observations have been combined with existing iso mid - infrared and atca cm radio continuum observations to examine the protostellar content of the bok globule bhr  71 .",
    "together with observations of herbig - haro objects , these data show :    \\(1 ) two protostellar sources , irs1 and irs2 , with a separation of @xmath017  ( 3400 au ) are located within bhr  71 , as revealed by iso mid - infrared observations .",
    "irs1 is the brighter of the two by about a factor 10 .",
    "the observations suggest that a binary protostellar system has formed within bhr  71 .",
    "irs1 is a class 0 protostar , while irs2 , associated with much less circumstellar dust and driving a much weaker co outflow , is probably a more evolved class i protostar .",
