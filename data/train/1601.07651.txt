    "the seniority scheme , first introduced by racah  @xcite in the atomic context , has been widely successful in explaining the spectroscopic features of semi - magic nuclei .",
    "a generalization of the single - j pure seniority scheme to multi - j generalized seniority was presented by arima and ichimura  @xcite .",
    "sn - isotopes represent the longest chain of isotopes in the nuclear chart . because of the semi - magic nature of the sn - isotopes ,",
    "the seniority scheme  @xcite has been extensively used to understand the various systematics in these nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these also provide a rigorous testing ground for the various effective interactions used in the large scale shell model ( lssm ) calculations  @xcite .",
    "we have recently used the generalized seniority formalism for multi - j degenerate orbits to show that both the even and odd tensor electric transition probabilities for same seniority ( @xmath2 ) transitions follow similar trends , as schematically shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bel ]  @xcite . here",
    ", the reduced transition probabilities , @xmath7 , follow a parabolic behavior with a minimum at the middle of the valence space . as a result ,",
    "one expects larger half - life seniority isomers in the middle of the shell for both the even and the odd electric transitions . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we have convincingly shown that the @xmath1 , @xmath2 transition probabilities from the @xmath8 isomers in sn - isotopes behave similar to the @xmath9 , @xmath2 transition probabilities of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 isomers in sn - isotopes . as a consequence",
    ", the two classes of isomers may be treated on the same footing in this simple approach .",
    "it was also pointed out by us that the @xmath7 values for either odd or even @xmath12 in the case of seniority change by @xmath4 exhibit an inverted parabolic behavior , as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bel ] . in the present letter",
    ", we present the first evidence of the seniority changing @xmath4 odd tensor transitions , where the @xmath13 values for the @xmath14 to @xmath15 transitions in the sn - isotopes , nicely fit into the inverted parabolic behavior obtained from our calculations .    to show this , we have used the @xmath16 values of the first @xmath15 states in the sn - isotopes from the compilation of kibedi and spear  @xcite , which decay to the @xmath14 ground state via @xmath3 transition .",
    "these @xmath15 states are generally believed to be octupole vibrational in character . in 1981 , jonsson @xmath17 @xmath18  @xcite have reported the measurements of @xmath15 states in @xmath19sn using @xmath20 reaction and coulomb excitation , and also compared their measurements with previously known data and theoretical calculations , which were quite far from the experimental data .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath15 states , was later studied by ansari and ring  @xcite within relativistic quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( rqrpa ) , which highlighted the new challenges in fixing the force parameters for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 interactions to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "the rqrpa estimates were successful in obtaining the overall trend of the @xmath5 values .",
    "we now present a study of the @xmath15 states by using the simple microscopic approach based on generalized seniority scheme reported in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "we find that the same scheme reproduces the systematics of @xmath16 transition probabilities remarkably well .",
    "remarkably , the involvement of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbits is required to explain the nature of @xmath5 values , which supports the previous interpretation of these states being octupole vibrational in character , as these orbits can be connected by a @xmath25 interaction .",
    "we have also carried out the seniority guided lssm calculations by using the @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbits alone to validate our results , and are able to reproduce the measured systematics reasonably well . the generalized seniority scheme , therefore , turns out to be immensely useful in singling out the most critical valence space for the lssm calculations .",
    "the @xmath15 states thus satisfy the generalized seniority scheme quite well .",
    "we present the details of the calculations and results in the next section .",
    "we have used the generalized seniority formalism for multi - j degenerate orbits presented in our recent paper  @xcite , to calculate the @xmath5 values in the sn - isotopes .",
    "the reduced @xmath5 transition probabilities for @xmath26 particles in the multi - j @xmath27 configuration can be obtained from the equation , @xmath28 where the reduced matrix elements between @xmath4 states can be written in terms of seniority reduction formula as [ 5 ] , @xmath29 \\nonumber\\\\ \\langle \\tilde{j}^v v l",
    "j_f ||\\sum_i r_i^3 y^{3}|| \\tilde{j}^v v\\pm 2 l ' j_i \\rangle \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficients in the square brackets depend on the particle number @xmath26 , the generalized seniority @xmath30 and the corresponding total pair degeneracy @xmath31 in the multi - j configuration .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath13 values for the @xmath15 states in the sn - isotopes by using two values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , corresponding to the @xmath34 , and @xmath35 valence spaces , respectively .",
    "we calculate the complete systematics by fitting the @xmath5 values for @xmath36sn and @xmath37sn for @xmath38 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we have taken @xmath39sn as the core for @xmath38 , while @xmath40sn as the core in the case of @xmath41 , where the core represents the @xmath42 situation .",
    "a comparison of the calculated results for both the @xmath43 values with the known experimental data  @xcite is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : be3 ] .",
    "the measured values as well as the calculations show a peak in the middle of the given valence space .",
    "this behavior is as expected for odd tensor transitions taking place among the states having seniorities differing by @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bel ] ) .",
    "hence , the simple generalized seniority scheme is able to explain the complete systematics with the valence space consisting of @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbits .",
    "we note that @xmath38 corresponds to the @xmath34 valence space and @xmath41 corresponds to the @xmath35 valence space .",
    "the experimental data are better reproduced by the results for @xmath41 suggesting that both the @xmath45 and @xmath46 orbits need to be included . as we show further the lssm calculations carried out by us support this conclusion .",
    "we have carried out the lssm calculations by using the valence spaces of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , taking a cue from the generalized seniority calculations , though the active orbits , for the @xmath47 neutron valence space , are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "we have used the nushell code  @xcite and sn100pn interaction  @xcite for the lssm calculations in the sn - isotopes .",
    "the neutron single particle energies have been taken as -10.6089 , -10.2893 , -8.7167 , -8.6944 , -8.8152 mev for the available @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 valence orbits .",
    "we have taken the @xmath53 orbit as completely filled .",
    "the neutron effective charges of 1.5 and 1.6 have been used , for the @xmath34 and @xmath35 valence spaces , respectively .",
    "the harmonic oscillator potential was chosen with an oscillator parameter of @xmath54 .",
    "we have plotted the calculated results along with the experimental data in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : be3 ] , by dashed and dotted lines corresponding to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 valence spaces .",
    "these seniority guided lssm calculations reproduce the measured values quite well , except at @xmath55sn .",
    "the calculated results , for the @xmath35 valence space , reproduce the measured values much better . these calculations , hence , validate the choice of seniority guided valence space for the @xmath15 states in the sn - isotopes .",
    "this procedure can be very useful to simplify the lssm calculations , particularly where the dimensions become very large .",
    "however , the deviation of the shell model results for @xmath55sn isotope is very puzzling .",
    "this isotope has @xmath56 , a possible magic number for octupole collectivity  @xcite .",
    "yet , the measured @xmath5 value for @xmath55sn is observed to be lower than @xmath36sn .",
    "still , the rqrpa calculations of ansari and ring  @xcite do show a fall in the @xmath5 value for @xmath55sn as compared to @xmath36sn as seen in the experimental data .",
    "our calculations by using the generalized seniority scheme also reproduce the results reasonably well",
    ". however , the lssm calculations are not able to reproduce this fall in b(e3 ) for @xmath55sn .",
    "to conclude , we have used the generalized seniority scheme for multi - j degenerate orbits to calculate the @xmath16 transition probabilities for the @xmath15 states in the sn - isotopes .",
    "our calculations successfully reproduce the parabolic behavior of @xmath5 values with a peak in the middle due to the fact that the transition involves a seniority change of @xmath57 .",
    "we also present lssm calculations , using the @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbits from @xmath47 neutron valence space , as guided by the generalized seniority calculations .",
    "these shell model calculations reproduce the experimental data quite well , and support the generalized seniority scheme , except for a deviation at @xmath55sn .",
    "this explanation also supports the octupole vibrational character of the @xmath15 states , as they arise due to @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbits differing in @xmath58 values by @xmath59 units .",
    "however , the deviation of the lssm results for @xmath55sn remains a puzzle .",
    "on the other hand , the rqrpa calculations as well as our calculations explain the overall trend pretty well .",
