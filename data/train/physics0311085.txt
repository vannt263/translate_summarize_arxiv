    "the utility of he  ii as a gentle , quantum matrix for the high - resolution spectroscopic study of impurity molecules is now well - established.@xcite accompanying these recent developments in experimental methodology is an interest in examining the spectroscopy of large , planar aromatic molecules ( pam ) in helium .",
    "these pams can be viewed as nanoscale precursors to bulk graphite surfaces , whose size and geometry can be systematically tuned .",
    "the experiments have examined the electronic spectra of the molecules , and can be divided into two general classes : a ) those involving small numbers of helium atoms ( @xmath5 ) around the impurity molecule , and b ) those where the pam is embedded in a large helium droplet ( @xmath6  10000 ) .",
    "the electronic spectra of pams in helium exhibit features not found for the corresponding bare molecules .",
    "these new features are presumably due to the presence of helium on the molecule surface , but a more specific understanding of their origins does not yet exist . in the absorption experiments , sharp excitations",
    "have been observed at @xmath7  k above the electronic origin , which have been qualitatively attributed to the localized vibrations of helium atoms adsorbed on the molecule surface.@xcite this energy range also encompasses the band of states ( phonon wings ) associated with collective compressional excitations of the cluster interior,@xcite and in the large cluster experiments these localized excitations appear as additional structure superimposed on the phonon wing sidebands .",
    "for the electronic spectra of a number of different pams ( tetracene , mg - phthalocyanine , and various indole derivatives ) in large he droplets , the peak associated with the electronic origin ( zero - phonon line ) also exhibits additional structure , with splittings on the order of @xmath8  k.@xcite these splittings are not observed in the small cluster experiments,@xcite and their physical origins are not completely understood at this point .",
    "one possibility is that they are due to the excitation of low - energy modes involving the collective motion of helium atoms on the molecule surface .",
    "theoretical calculations for the he@xmath1-benzene cluster suggest that individual helium atoms are strongly localized on the molecule surface.@xcite as we discuss further below , this is a general feature which we find for a number of other pams , so another possible explanation is that these splittings do not arise from elastic transitions at all , but are instead due to inhomogeneities in the local helium environment around the molecule .",
    "recent emission experiments have also revealed additional features not previously seen in absorption . for a number of other pams ( phthalocyanine , mg - phthalocyanine , pentacene ) , when an electronic and vibrational mode in the impurity molecule are simultaneously excited",
    ", the resulting emission spectrum as the molecule relaxes to the ground state is similar to that for absorption , except each line is split into two peaks that are separated by @xmath9  k.@xcite this suggests that the helium dynamics after electronic excitation are more complicated than previously thought .    in this work",
    ", we present the results of quantum monte carlo calculations for small numbers of helium atoms ( @xmath10 ) around various pams .",
    "the strength and anisotropy of the molecule - helium interaction gives rise to a strongly localized layer of helium atoms on the molecule surface in the cluster ground states .",
    "this localization has important consequences for the excited states,@xcite and we report some preliminary results for excitations due to the vibrational motion of helium atoms in this first monolayer .",
    "we propose that the strong ground state localization implies similar confinement of the excited state , which may consequently affect the dynamics of energy transfer .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath0he@xmath1-pam cluster consists of the rigid - body kinetic energy for the pam , the translational kinetic energy for the @xmath3 @xmath0he atoms , and the total potential energy @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath11 is taken as a sum over two - body helium - helium@xcite and helium - pam interactions , where the helium - pam interaction @xmath12 is a sum of atom - atom lennard - jones pair potentials in the principal axis frame of the molecule : @xmath13.\\ ] ] the sum over @xmath14 runs over the individual atoms of the molecule situated at the position @xmath15 , and lennard - jones parameters @xmath16 were taken from vidali _",
    "et al._@xcite the potentials evaluated in this manner are qualitatively similar .",
    "each of the potentials for the linear pams exhibits minima near the center of the aromatic rings .",
    "the global minima in the potential of each molecule occur at @xmath17    above and below the molecule surface .",
    "the potential for tetracene at this distance from the molecule surface is shown in figure  [ fig : density]c .",
    "ground state properties are obtained using diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) methods , in particular the importance - sampled rigid body diffusion monte carlo algorithm.@xcite the trial functions used here are products of two - body factors , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 describe helium - pam and helium - helium correlations , respectively : @xmath21 the trial function parameters @xmath22 are obtained by minimizing the variational energy of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "excited state energies are obtained using the projection operator , imaginary time spectral evolution ( poitse ) method.@xcite this yields the spectral density function @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the set of eigenfunctions and associated eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the many - body operator @xmath28 is a bose - symmetrized sum of one - body excitation operators @xmath29 , and is chosen to connect the ground state @xmath24 to the excited state(s ) of interest .",
    "ground state helium density distributions for @xmath0he@xmath30-naphthalene , @xmath0he@xmath31-anthracene , @xmath0he@xmath32-tetracene , and @xmath0he@xmath33-phthalocyanine were obtained using the quantum monte carlo methods described above .",
    "the number of @xmath0he atoms around each of the pams studied here corresponds to full coverage of both sides of the nanosubstrate surface . in all cases ,",
    "the global density maxima occur at a distance of @xmath34    above and below the molecule plane .",
    "figures  [ fig : density]a , [ fig : density]b , [ fig : density]d , and [ fig : excited]a show cuts of the local helium density at this distance , along a plane parallel to the molecule surface .",
    "it is apparent that the local helium densities consist of well - separated peaks , each corresponding to a single @xmath0he atom . for the linear pams ,",
    "each individual @xmath0he atom is approximately situated above a six - membered carbon ring . for phthalocyanine",
    ", we find that this surface can support up to 12 @xmath0he atoms on each side . at full coverage , this 2d layer of @xmath0he on phthalocyanine consists of four @xmath0he atoms grouped near the center of the molecule , surrounded by an outer ring of eight @xmath0he atoms .",
    "previous work with the @xmath0he@xmath1-benzene system ( @xmath35 ) has revealed similar ground state features.@xcite the benzene system can be viewed as the simplest @xmath0he@xmath1-pam system , serving as a building block for models of more complicated one- and two - dimensional nanosubstrates . in that study , not only were the ground states observed to be strongly localized , but the _ excited states _ also exhibited localized character .",
    "that is , excitations due to the localized vibrational motion of @xmath0he on the benzene surface were found , with energies of up to @xmath36  k above the ground state .",
    "we propose here that these excited state features exist generally for larger @xmath0he - pam systems , and that they are a result of the strong localization of the helium ground state density distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : excited]b shows the spectral density function [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa ] ) ] for @xmath0he@xmath32-tetracene , evaluated using the poitse methodology discussed above .    for a choice of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where the @xmath39-direction is taken to be along the long axis of the molecule",
    ", we find excitations at @xmath40  k above the ground state .",
    "these states correspond to the collective vibrational motion of the @xmath0he atoms moving on the molecule surface along the @xmath39-direction .",
    "work is currently in progress to extend these calculations to larger @xmath3 , in order to ascertain whether the collective character of these excitations persists as additional atoms are added around the molecule .",
    "a helium excitation confined on the molecule surface would have important consequences for spectroscopy , particularly for the dynamics of energy dissipation .",
    "typically , the molecule is excited from the electronic ground state @xmath41 to an electronic excited state @xmath42 . for a weakly interacting small molecule in a vibrationally excited state of @xmath42 ,",
    "this excess vibrational energy is transferred to the local helium environment .",
    "it is generally assumed that this energy is rapidly carried away from the molecule due to the large thermal conductivity of he  ii.@xcite in a helium droplet , this energy is dissipated as helium atoms boil off the surface of the droplet , and so the relaxation back to @xmath41 derives primarily from the ground vibrational state of @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the excess vibrational energy of the molecule is transferred to the helium and trapped near the surface of the molecule , the resulting local helium environment could be very different from that of the ground vibrational state and would then correspond to a metastable state .",
    "these two situations could give rise to two distinct @xmath42 surfaces , resulting in a split emission spectrum similar to that observed by lehnig and slenczka .",
    "@xcite calculation of the local helium density for the @xmath42 state , which requires a currently unknown interaction potential , would facilitate a more detailed analysis ."
