    "the discovery of higgs boson , confirmed by the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc  @xcite , provides the forceful evidence for the brout - englert - higgs mechanism in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the impressive accurate experimental results not only support the success of the sm but also push the theoretical predictions forward to a higher accuracy .",
    "except for the mass and spin , other properties of higgs boson should be clear to achieve the completeness of the sm .",
    "it is well known that the masses of fermion are extracted from the related yukawa interactions , which offer the opportunity to study the interaction of higgs boson and fermions . due to the large quark mass , the yukawa coupling of @xmath0 is order of one .",
    "therefore a large number of phenomena can be studied in the higgs boson production associated with the top quark pair .",
    "the precise measurements on the higgs sector are indispensable for the understanding of the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "latest results on the higgs mass as well as the spin and parity  @xcite are reported by the atlas and cms collaborations . at the same time",
    "the couplings of higgs boson are consistent with the predictions in the sm  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible for the observed higgs boson to be one scalar sector in the other physics models , such as the two higgs doublet models  @xcite , the minimal supersymmetric models  @xcite and the left - right symmetric models  @xcite , etc .",
    "top quark , as the known heaviest quark , is expected to decay before hadronization for its short life time .",
    "hence , its spin property can be transferred to its decay products .",
    "the spin effects of @xmath1 production have been studied at the hadron colliders  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the top quark spin effects are sensitive to the new interactions  @xcite .",
    "investigating the @xmath0 production is helpful to discriminate the higgs boson among various models .",
    "the leading - order and the next - leading - order @xmath0 cross section predictions have been accomplished in the literatures  @xcite .",
    "both the atlas and cms experiments have performed the measurement on the @xmath0 production with @xmath2 at @xmath3 tev  @xcite . some phenomena on @xmath0 interaction",
    "have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath0 signal and the corresponding backgrounds analysis have been studied in details  @xcite .",
    "the cp - properties of @xmath0 interaction play an important roles in the understanding of yukawa interaction , which can be probed through the higgs production in association with the top quark pair at the lhc  @xcite . besides the topics discussed in the previous works , in this paper we concentrate on the spin observables with different higgs mass for scalar .",
    "then we discuss systematically the spin observables for the scalar , pseudoscalar and mixing higgs in @xmath0 production at the lhc .",
    "additionally , we also simply investigate the corresponding background processes for our signal process @xmath4 .",
    "these results both at lhc 13 tev and 33tev can help to study the higgs properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the @xmath0 interactions in the sm and the two higgs doublet models are reviewed in section ii , together with the brief introduction of top quark spin correlations .",
    "after that the @xmath0 production at the lhc and the corresponding observables are analyzed in section iii . finally , a short summary is given .",
    "in the sm , the scalar sector includes one su(2 ) doublet . after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the higgs boson couples to the top quark in the formula of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the top quark mass and",
    "@xmath7 is the vacuum  expectation value of higgs .",
    "naturally , this interaction is cp - even under cp transformation .",
    "compared with the single su(2 ) doublet in the sm , it includes an additional su(2 ) doublet in the two - higgs - doublet model for the scalar sector .",
    "it means there are two vacuum expectation values , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , one generalized representation for the scalar doublet is @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the scalar fields . after the spontaneous symmetry breaking , there remain five physical higgs particles : two cp - even @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons , one cp - odd @xmath18 boson , and two charged @xmath19 bosons .",
    "naturally , the light neutral higgs @xmath16 could be regard as the sm higgs boson . following that the yukawa coupling for the neutral higgs bosons can be obtained from the lagrangian @xmath20 where it brings three types of yukawa interaction for the sm - like higgs , the heavy higgs and the pseudoscalar higgs .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 interaction gets more complicated and leads to different properties for the production .    for the top quark lifetime",
    "is extremely short , it decays without hadronization .",
    "thus the decay production becomes important to analyze the top quark spin information . defining the angle of decay particle s ( @xmath21 s ) moving direction with the top quark spin polarization direction as @xmath22",
    ", one can obtain the distribution of the decay production in the formula of @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the polarization degree , @xmath25 is the spin - analyzer power of @xmath21 , and @xmath21 can be @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . in the sm , the tree level result shows that @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "thus the charged lepton and the down type light quark are the best spin analyzers .    in the top quark pair production ,",
    "the spin correlation is related to the final charged lepton . according to the spin correlation",
    ", the spin asymmetry of @xmath34 manifests in the decay particle double distribution @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the cross section of the respective reaction . here",
    "@xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the angle between the direction of flight of the lepton @xmath39 or jet @xmath40 ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) from @xmath43 @xmath44 decay in the @xmath43 ( @xmath45 ) rest frame and various polarization directions .",
    "the coefficient @xmath46(@xmath47 ) reflects the single spin effects in @xmath1 production and @xmath48 is a measure of @xmath49 spin correlations . the polarization and the spin correlation provides important information on the dynamics of the top quark . the similar distributions of @xmath0 production at the hadron colliders can be obtained , which support to investigate the spin effects in @xmath0 production at the lhc .",
    "at the proton - proton colliders the @xmath0 is produced via the quark annihilation and the gluon fusion processes , which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : feydiag ] at the leading order qcd . due to",
    "the charged lepton is a good trigger for the detector at the proton - proton collider ( e.g. lhc ) , we investigate the @xmath0 production process with both top quarks leptonic decay , @xmath50    one can notice that the @xmath0 interaction is different for scalar and pseudoscalar higgs from equation ( [ eq : lag2hdm ] ) . in the follows , we respectively study the @xmath49 production in association with light higgs ( sm - higgs ) , heavy higgs and scalar - pseudoscalar mixing higgs .",

    "based on the @xmath49 spin correlations , the observables related to the @xmath0 interaction can be defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the unit vector of @xmath26 ( @xmath57 ) moving direction in the top quark rest frame , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the unit vector of @xmath43 ( @xmath60 ) moving direction in the @xmath0 rest frame , and @xmath61 is the unit vector of @xmath0 system moving direction in the @xmath62 rest frame . obviously , @xmath63 is a parity violated observable which is sensitive to the parity violated interactions .",
    "it is proportional to the interference term between scalar and pseudoscalar components .",
    "therefore it will disappear for the pure scalar or the pure pseudoscalar higgs .    for the numerical results , we define the expectation value of the operator as @xmath64 where @xmath36 is the cross section of process ( [ pp2tth ] ) .",
    "in table  [ tab : sm - ob ] we display the observables with the collision energy of 13 tev and 33 tev at the lhc .",
    "one can notice that the gluon fusion and quark pair annihilation subprocesses contribute opposite sign for the observables in the @xmath0 production , which is the same as in the @xmath1 production  @xcite .",
    ".observables at the lhc 13 tev and 33 tev for @xmath65 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "a large number of higgs events will be accumulated at the lhc , and the properties of higgs boson should be addressed . in the sm , one cp - even higgs boson is assumed via the simplest scalar doublet , which has been naturally extended in the new physics models , such as the two higgs doublet models .",
    "the phenomenology of higgs sector is extremely rich , since it contains more than one higgs .",
    "the interactions of higgs boson coupling to other particles are more complex than those in the sm . therefore , to discriminate the new physics models , it is important to study the properties of higgs . for this aim , in this paper",
