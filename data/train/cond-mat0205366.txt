    "long range spatial correlations ( algebraic decay ) in simple classical fluids _ at equilibrium _ occur only near a thermodynamic critical point , i.e. for finely tuned values of the thermodynamic parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "such long range correlations appear generically for a wide class of _ nonequilibrium _ states @xcite .",
    "the predictions of this phenomenon have been made in a number of contexts , including self - organized criticality @xcite , linear response @xcite , kinetic theory kinetic , and stochastic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most direct approach is that of linear response where the nonequilibrium correlation functions are expanded about the equilibrium state to first order in a nonequilibrium control parameter ( typically a spatial gradient ) . the algebraic decay is then seen to result from spontaneous excitations of hydrodynamic modes induced by the coupling of the control parameter to an associated flux .",
    "a more intuitive analysis of this effect follows from an extension of fluctuating hydrodynamics to nonequilibrium states . to linear order in the control parameter the same algebraic decay",
    "is found , as expected .",
    "such theoretical studies for the density autocorrelation function in a fluid subject to a temperature gradient have received detailed experimental confirmation in recent years @xcite .",
    "the shortest length scale is set by the intermolecular force range , while the experimental verification is on macroscopic system size scales . since the decay is algebraic there would appear to be no other length scale involved .",
    "however , we argue here that there is an additional macroscopic scale set by the parameters of the  nonequilibrium state such that the true asymptotic decay is faster than that predicted by simple perturbative studies near equilibrium .",
    "the analysis here is limited to a single nonequilibrium state , that of uniform shear flow , but the qualitative features are expected to extend to other nonequilibrium states as well .",
    "uniform shear flow ( usf ) is characterized by a constant average density and temperature , and an average velocity flow field given by @xmath5 where the shear rate tensor is traceless ( @xmath6 in a cartesian frame of reference ) .",
    "this nonequilibrium state has a single scalar control parameter @xmath4 and has been the subject of numerous theoretical investigations aimed at understanding transport and fluctuations in a model nonequilibrium state @xcite .",
    "all of these share in common the assumption that at large length and time scales , the dynamics of fluctuations in a simple fluid are dominated by the contribution of the hydrodynamic modes which decay much more slowly than do the neglected , kinetic modes .",
    "the result is that the decay of thermal fluctuations in the hydrodynamic fields , i.e. the density , momentum and energy fields , is governed at large length and time scales by equations formally identical to the phenomenological navier - stokes equations . here , ",
    "large length and time scales  means scales large compared to the mean free path and mean free time which is the usual domain of validity of hydrodynamics .",
    "correlations between the values of thermally generated fluctuations in the fields at two different space - time points can be modeled by supplementing these equations with random forces which represent the interaction of this restricted set of variables with the neglected degrees of freedom to give a langevin model . in equilibrium ,",
    "the result of the navier - stokes - langevin model is that the equal - time correlation functions for two hydrodynamic fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 are simply proportional to delta - functions in the spatial arguments@xmath9where @xmath10 , and the amplitude @xmath11 is a corresponding thermodynamic response function .",
    "this result simply confirms that fluctuations at different points in space are uncorrelated when speaking of hydrodynamic length scales ( i.e. , neglecting correlations on the scale of the force range ) .",
    "in contrast , these correlation functions for the nonequilibrium state have a new long range component , which to first order in the shear rate is of the form@xmath12the amplitude @xmath13 is again a thermodynamic response function . the physical difference between equilibrium and nonequilibrium",
    "is due to the way in which small hydrodynamic fluctuations decay . at equilibrium",
    "this occurs locally due to viscous and thermal damping , whereas in shear flow it is convected as well and spreads out over a length scale that varies as the speed of convection times the time scale for viscous and thermal damping machta , tremblay .    with",
    "the exception of reference @xcite , the form ( [ 0.2 ] ) was generally obtained using a perturbative treatment in fourier representation assuming that the shear rate @xmath4 ( with dimensions of frequency ) is smaller than all other hydrodynamic frequencies , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a propagation velocity , @xmath17 is a transport coefficient , and @xmath18 is the wavevector . for fixed shear rate ,",
    "this therefore sets an upper bound on the range of separations in real space for which the results apply . in this context , the true asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions remains unclear .",
    "the analysis of reference lutsko has the potential to resolve this question since it is non - perturbative and retains the two dominant effects of large shear rate : secular effects @xmath19 associated with convection , and shear rates comparable to the hydrodynamic damping @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting correlation functions are found to have the form@xmath21the function @xmath22 depends on a new nonequilibrium correlation length , @xmath23 . for @xmath24 the result ( [ 0.2 ] )",
    "is recovered .",
    "however , the asymptotic form for @xmath25 was not explored in any detail in reference @xcite .    here , we attempt to clarify the asymptotic behavior of the static correlation functions in a sheared fluid in two ways .",
    "first , it is shown that the continuity equation and stationarity place exact constraints on the decay of the density autocorrelation function such that it must be faster than @xmath26 for large @xmath1 .",
    "this result is independent of any model for evaluating the correlation function .",
    "next , we reconsider @xmath27 in ( [ 0.3 ] ) from the results of reference @xcite and show the actual asymptotic behavior is @xmath28 . the crossover between the @xmath26 behavior at short length - scales and the stronger @xmath28 decay at large separations is illustrated by numerical evaluation of the general result .",
    "consider @xmath29 atoms with positions and momenta denoted @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively and denoted collectively as @xmath32 .",
    "the atoms interact via a central two - body potential @xmath33 and are confined to a volume @xmath34 such that the average density is @xmath35 .",
    "the potential is assumed to be repulsive at short distances and to diverge as @xmath36 and to have a finite force range .",
    "uniform shear flow results from the application of lees - edwards boundary conditions @xcite consisting of periodic boundaries in all directions except that of the gradient ( here , the @xmath37-direction ) .",
    "if a particle exits the volume in the positive @xmath37-direction ( say , at @xmath38 ) , it is re - entered at the opposite side of the volume ( @xmath39 ) with its velocity in the direction of flow shifted as @xmath40 .",
    "taken together , these constitute periodic boundaries in the local rest frame .",
    "the temperature will generally increase due to viscous heating but we will follow standard practice and assume the presence of a thermostat which counteracts the viscous heating so that the temperature is also constant in time leading to a steady - state @xcite .",
    "the dynamics thus described possess several important symmetries that will be used below .",
    "first , they are invariant with respect to parity of the positions and momenta so that the equations of motion and boundary conditions are the same if written in terms of the variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "second , they are invariant under mirror reflection about the @xmath43-axis ( but not the @xmath44 or @xmath37 axes since the boundary condition couples the @xmath44-velocity and the @xmath37-coordinate ) .",
    "third , since usf is a steady state , statistical properties are invariant with respect to a change in the origin from which time is measured ( time translational invariance ) .",
    "fourth , usf is translationally invariant in the local rest - frame as well as in a mixed frame consisting of the laboratory positions and the velocities measured relative to the flow lutsko .",
    "the microscopic local density and momentum fields are defined respectively as@xmath45where @xmath46 is the momentum defined relative to the local flow field and @xmath47 is the point in phase space the system would reach after evolving from the initial point @xmath48 for a time @xmath49 . note that these fields are related by the microscopic continuity equation@xmath50the correlations functions are defined as@xmath51where subscripts @xmath4 and @xmath52 label the specific field considered , @xmath53 is the distribution of phase variables at initial time @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . for a steady - state",
    "the time dependence occurs through @xmath56 due to time translational invariance . because of the modified spatial translational invariance",
    ", it is also possible to show that the correlation functions depend only on the relative separation .",
    "consequently the correlation functions can be written@xmath57    choosing @xmath58 and @xmath59 , eq.([3 ] ) gives the relationship@xmath60where for notational simplicity @xmath61 .",
    "this result has been derived previously in a different context @xcite .",
    "it simplifies further using the translational , parity , and reflection invariance noted above to give the final form of interest here @xmath62this is an exact result that follows directly from stationarity and conservation of mass . integrating ( [ 4.3 ] ) over a spherical volume bounded by shells at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and making use of gauss s theorem gives the relationship of @xmath65 to @xmath66 @xmath67the notation @xmath68 indicates a surface integral over the unit sphere and use has been made of the fact that the correlation functions evaluated at the origin vanish since the potential will not allow atoms to occupy the same spatial position ( the singular contribution to @xmath69 is excluded from the integration volume ) .    equation ( [ 5 ] ) is the main result of this section . to put this in context ,",
    "consider an expansion of @xmath66 to first order in the shear rate with the form @xmath70inserting this into eq.([5 ] ) gives@xmath71showing that if the density - momentum correlation function decays for large separations , as it must , then the first - order correction to the density - density correlation function must decay faster than @xmath72 .",
    "this result is independent of the dimensionality of the system .",
    "furthermore , multiplying eq.([5 ] ) by @xmath73 and integrating gives , in @xmath74-dimensions,@xmath75the quantity on the left is @xmath76which vanishes in equilibrium but can be finite for usf due to velocity correlations .",
    "this in turn implies that the first order correction to the shear rate decays faster than @xmath77 .",
    "these results can be given a somewhat more general interpretation .",
    "any function of a vector in terms of the spherical harmonics in order to separate the dependence of the function on the direction and magnitude of its argument .",
    "the density - density correlation function becomes @xmath78with@xmath79because of the parity symmetry of usf , it is easy to show that only coefficients with even values of @xmath80 are nonzero while the inversion symmetry about the @xmath43-axis implies that only even values of @xmath81 contribute . then , noting that @xmath82eq.([5 ] ) becomes@xmath83the conclusions drawn about the first - order correction @xmath84 are seen to be exact statements also about @xmath85 valid to _ all _ orders in the shear rate : namely , that @xmath86 must decay faster than @xmath87 in any number of dimensions and faster than @xmath77 in @xmath74 - dimensions if the spatial integral of the radial part of the density - momentum correlation function is finite .",
    "this corresponds precisely to the quantity for which the first - order results ( [ 0.2 ] ) predicted a @xmath87 decay .",
    "consequently , that result can not be correct for sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "the algebraic decays of both static and dynamic correlation functions observed in simple fluids can be derived by means of fluctuating hydrodynamics . in this model ,",
    "the exact conservation laws for the local density , momentum and energy density fields , @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively , @xmath91are approximated by taking the pressure tensor , @xmath92 and heat flux vector , @xmath93 , to be a sum of two terms : the usual navier - stokes functionals of the local fields , and a random component which is delta - function correlated in space and time .",
    "the amplitudes of these correlations are related to the forms of the deterministic parts of the fluxes @xcite . rewriting these in terms of deviations from the macroscopic state",
    "then gives a description of fluctuations about this state .",
    "the details for usf have been discussed in detail elsewhere lutsko and only the results are quoted for the purposes here .",
    "defining the fourier transform of the density - density correlation function as@xmath94the result obtained for it is @xmath95@xmath96here @xmath97 is the isothermal compressibility , @xmath98 is the equilibrium speed of sound , @xmath17 is the equilibrium sound - damping constant , @xmath99 is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and volume , and @xmath100 .",
    "the characteristic length scale is @xmath101 . the first term in eq.([16 ] )",
    "is the equilibrium contribution which , in the small wavevector approximation used here , is a constant .",
    "the second term represents the nonequilibrium correction which is derived assuming that the shear rate and rate of dissipation are significantly less than the sound frequency , @xmath102 where @xmath98 is the speed of sound",
    ". however , no restriction on the value of @xmath103 is imposed .",
    "the inverse transform of eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) is the real space result quoted in ( [ 0.3 ] ) above .    in order to evaluate the behavior in real space ,",
    "it is useful to introduce the expansion of @xmath104 in spherical harmonics @xmath105and to recall the relation between the coefficients ( [ 11 ] ) to those in ( [ 17])@xmath106this gives directly@xmath107with@xmath108the small shear rate limit ( [ 0.2 ] ) is obtained by noting that @xmath109 is inversely proportional to the shear rate and expanding to leading order in @xmath110@xmath111    \\nonumber \\\\ & \\rightarrow & \\frac{a}{\\lambda _ { 0}r}\\left [ i\\delta _ { l2}\\left ( \\delta _ { m2}-\\delta _ { m-2}\\right ) \\frac{\\pi } { 4}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi } { 15}}\\right ]   \\label{20b}\\end{aligned}\\]]the context here shows that this result applys only in the limit @xmath112 which is to say that , for fixed shear rate , this is a _ small _ @xmath1 result and does not represent the true long - range behavior of the correlation function .",
    "the actual asymptotic behavior for large @xmath113 is obtained in the appendix where it is found that @xmath114 all other components decay even more rapidly .",
    "in particular the true asymptotic behavior of @xmath115 is found to be@xmath116 this is consistent with the exact result ( [ 13 ] ) that this component must decay more slowly than @xmath117 in three dimensions .    in order to probe the asymptotic behavior in more detail ,",
    "we have performed a numerical evaluation of eq.([20 ] ) by means of multi - dimensional monte carlo integration using the vegas algorithm@xcite . rather than directly evaluating eq.([20 ] ) , it was found to be more efficient to separate out the short - ranged @xmath0 behavior by rewriting this as@xmath118the number of samples used in the performing the integrals was adjusted so that the internal estimate of the error in the evaluations was always less than 5% of the calculated values . for small @xmath119 ,",
    "the errors were substantially less while the limit was occasionally reached as @xmath119 was increased .",
    "figure 1 shows the spherically averaged value , @xmath120 , as a function of @xmath119 together with the asymptotic power law of @xmath121 and the two are seen to be consistent .",
    "figure 2 shows the numerical calculation @xmath122 in comparison with the small- and large-@xmath1 limits , eqs.([20b ] ) and ( [ 21a ] ) respectively .",
    "again , crossover between the limiting forms is clearly identified .",
    "the prediction of @xmath0 decays in the density autocorrelation function in shear flow is in violation of an exact bound coming from elementary considerations of statistical mechanics and the properties of the  usf steady state .",
    "detailed analysis of a less restrictive solution of the navier - stokes - langevin model confirms that the @xmath0 behavior is actually valid only for @xmath123 and that this crosses over to a stronger power law decay at large distances .",
    "it turns out for this model that the density - energy correlation function as well as energy and longitudinal - velocity autocorrelation functions share the same spatial dependence given by ( [ 20b ] ) .",
    "therefore the calculations given here apply to them as well .",
    "interestingly , the most long - ranged correlation function , based on calculations analogous to that illustrated in the appendix , is for one of the transverse - velocity autocorrelations which , in the notation of ref @xcite , has the form@xmath124   \\label{23}\\]]with @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the shear viscosity and @xmath127    the analysis here has implicitly assumed stability of the usf state . in fact",
    "usf is unstable to sufficiently long wavelength perturbations @xcite . the critical wavelength for stability scales approximately as @xmath128 for small @xmath4 where @xmath129 is the thermal velocity .",
    "therefore in order to see the crossover phenomenon discussed here there must be conditions such that @xmath130 .",
    "this requires @xmath131 which can be accomplished by small shear rates and high temperatures .",
    "the predicted behavior should be accessible via molecular dynamics simulation for a sufficiently large system .",
    "the qualitative feature of a nonequilibrium length scale should be more general than the special case of usf , and applicable to other nonequilibrium states as well .",
    "for example , a steady state with uniform temperature gradient has a characteristic frequency @xmath132 .",
    "setting this equal to a hydrodynamic damping gives the length scale @xmath133 .",
    "it is expected that the asymptotic decay for @xmath25 will be different from that of perturbative mode coupling theory currently in the literature for reasons similar to those given here for usf .",
