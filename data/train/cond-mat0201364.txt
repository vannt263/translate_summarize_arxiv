    "the disorder configuration will change from ring to ring . accordingly",
    "the density of states and the persistent current will be statistically distributed .",
    "it is well known that the average density of states , @xmath15 , is a flux independent quantity except for corrections which are exponentially small and proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "thus the average persistent current , as computed in the grand canonical ensemble , is negligibly small .",
    "fluctuations of the density of states , on the other hand , are not exponentially suppressed and have to be considered . manipulating the expression given in ref .",
    "one arrives at @xmath17 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the solution of the diffusion equation .",
    "this means that the density of states fluctuations are proportional to the integrated probability that a diffusing particle returns after time @xmath19 . for the ring structure",
    "there are topologically different possibilities to return to the origin , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "paths with zero winding number lead to the contribution @xmath20 and do not depend on magnetic flux , while paths which traverse the ring @xmath21 times lead to the term @xmath22 and are flux dependent .",
    "the reason is the following : first recall that a probability is in quantum mechanics always the product of amplitudes , @xmath23 . from all possible combinations @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) then selects pairs of equal paths @xmath25 and pairs of time reversed paths @xmath26 as illustrated in the figure . in the presence of a magnetic flux the phase of a closed path",

    "these processes then lead to the magnetic flux dependencies given in the density of states fluctuations , eq.([eq4 ] ) .    from the density of states fluctuations",
    "the persistent current fluctuations are found to be given by @xmath32 the temperature dependent factor originates from the fourier transform of the fermi function , @xmath33 at zero temperature only the diffusion time @xmath34 exists as a time scale in the above integral , and we obtain @xmath35 at finite temperature there is an exponential cut - off for long paths , proportional to @xmath36 , due to the hyperbolic sine in the denominator .",
    "this leads to a temperature dependence of the current on the diffusive scale @xmath37 for the @xmath38 component , and @xmath39 for the @xmath40 fourier component of the current where the electrons have to diffuse @xmath21 times around the ring .",
    "the coulomb interaction enhances the average current considerably above the value for non - interacting electrons , as pointed out by ambegaokar and eckern@xcite .",
    "again we consider the grand canonical potential and work out the flux sensitive correction in a simple approximation . consider the hartree expression for the coulomb interaction contribution to the thermodynamic potential , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the screened interaction and @xmath43 is the spatially varying electron density . in full analogy to what is found for the density of states , the average electron density is flux independent but the fluctuations do depend on magnetic flux . averaging the above equation with respect to disorder and including also the exchange ( fock ) term , we find @xmath44 the temperature dependent factor",
    "is related to the fourier transform of two fermi functions , similar to the noninteracting theory . as above , the diffusion probability @xmath45 appears . since only time reversed paths contribute to the average current , the primitive period is here given by @xmath46 , not @xmath38 .",
    "the dimensionless number @xmath47 characterizes the strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is given by the fermi surface average of the screened interaction , multiplied by the density of states .",
    "for copper , for example , @xmath47 has been estimated to be about @xmath48 . the final result for",

    "in addition , the attractive electron - phonon interaction reduces it even further .",
    "this could , in principle , also lead to a different sign , implying that the system undergoes a transition to a superconducting state at extremely low temperature .",
    "taking @xmath51 as a parameter which has to be put into the theory `` by hand '' , we replace @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eqointer ] ) by @xmath51 , and find the the zero temperature average persistent current to be given by @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .",
    "experimental results obtained by different groups are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the mean free path @xmath10 and the phase coherence length @xmath54 , given in the table , have been determined by transport measurements in equally prepared wires . in two of the experiments",
    "the number of rings was very large , @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the current per ring should then correspond to the average current calculated in theory . in both experiments",
    "the @xmath38 component of the current was not observed , in agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "also the amplitude of the @xmath46 component is reasonable , both theory and experiment find a current of the order of @xmath57 . in the first experiment",
    "the sign of the current was not clear .",
    "the amplitude of the experimental zero temperature current corresponds to an interaction parameter @xmath58 , which is at least a factor five larger than what we expect from the coulomb interaction in copper . in the second experiment ,",
    "13 , the sign of the current was negative ( diamagnetic ) , which is clearly at odds with a theory taking into account the coulomb interaction only .",
    "we emphasize that the computed temperature dependence is in perfect agreement with the experimental findings of ref .  2 , and in reasonable agreement with ref .  13",
    ": theory predicts in the relevant temperature range an exponential suppression , @xmath59 , with the typical temperature given by @xmath60 .",
    "an exponential decay was seen in both experiments . in the copper",
    "experiment@xcite the typical temperature was @xmath61 mk with @xmath62 mk and in the semiconductor experiment @xmath63 mk and @xmath64 mk .",
    ".summary of experimental results for the persistent current in diffusive rings [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the experiments on single or a few rings are more difficult to interpret .",
    "theory predicts that in single rings the typical current is of the order @xmath57 and should vary from sample to sample .",
    "the measured current in single gold rings@xcite was up to two orders of magnitude larger than this estimate .",
    "more recent measurements of the current in a few rings , on the other hand , are much closer to what is expected : for @xmath65 rings the typical current per ring is expected to be of the order @xmath66 .",
    "measurements for 30 gold rings and 16 semiconductor rings are consistent with this expectation , see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the measured @xmath38 current per ring , @xmath67 , is close to the expected current , which is of the order @xmath68 . concerning the @xmath46 current it is not clear whether for @xmath69 rings the average or the fluctuations dominate , since the expected fluctuations are of the order @xmath70 , which is only a factor two smaller than the experimentally observed current .",
    "the temperature suppression of the @xmath38 and the @xmath46 current reported in refs .",
    "11 and 12 is consistent with an exponential decay , with the characteristic temperature @xmath71 mk , and @xmath72 mk .",
    "the theoretical prediction in the relevant temperature range is@xcite @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 mk and @xmath76 mk , when inserting @xmath77 mk .",
    "the experimentally observed temperature suppression is thus somewhat slower than expected .",
    "in conclusion we have seen that in some aspects theory and experiments agree with each other : the periodicity of the current is predicted correctly for both the experiments with few and many rings .",
    "the amplitude of the current is of the order @xmath78 , and the temperature scale is reasonable , too .",
    "nevertheless the agreement is not satisfactory : although the @xmath46 current is of the right order of magnitude , it is still considerably larger than predicted .",
    "moreover the negative sign still requires an explanation .    due to",
    "this discrepancies it is important to consider alternative mechanisms that could influence the persistent current . in the following we discuss recent suggestions which connect persistent currents and phase breaking",
    "recently it has been suggested@xcite that the large persistent currents might be related to another problem in mesoscopic physics , namely the unexpectedly large electron dephasing rate .",
    "whereas it is expected that the dephasing rate decreases to zero in the low temperature limit@xcite , many experiments show a saturation in this limit .",
    "usually this saturation is attributed to the presence of magnetic impurities or to heating . at low temperature",
    "the latter is a serious problem , since heating sets in already at very low applied voltages .",
    "for example , when increasing the voltage , a saturation of the dephasing rate is seen experimentally@xcite , even though the resistance continues to increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "however , it has been argued@xcite that the above mentioned problems can be overcome , and that nevertheless a saturation of the dephasing rate is observed ,    several attempts have been made to explain this low temperature saturation@xcite .",
    "in particular it has been argued by altshuler _",
    "et al._@xcite that non - equilibrium electromagnetic noise can contribute to decoherence without heating the electrons .",
    "extending earlier work@xcite on the effect of a high frequency electromagnetic field in mesoscopic rings , kravtsov and altshuler@xcite have shown that non - equilibrium noise induces a directed non - equilibrium current .",
    "this leads to the suggestion that both the `` large '' currents observed@xcite and the strong dephasing are related , and are non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "the starting point of the theory is the weak localization correction to the current in the presence of magnetic flux and a time dependent electric field , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the cooperon at coinciding space points , and @xmath81 is determined by @xmath82 the momentum @xmath83 is for a ring structure given by @xmath84 .",
    "the constant @xmath85 depends on the dyson symmetry class : for pure potential disorder ( @xmath86 ) @xmath87 , while @xmath88 in the presence of strong spin - orbit scattering ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "altshuler and kravtsov calculated the @xmath90-component of the current , i.e. the time average @xmath91 , in presence of a random electric field with zero time average , @xmath92 , and correlations @xmath93 that decrease at @xmath94 , where @xmath95 . the final result for the average persistent",
    "current is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the noise - induced dephasing rate .",
    "if in one of the experiments dephasing is due to such a non - equilibrium electric noise , then the noise - induced current is also relevant : since in all experiments the phase coherence length is of the order of the phase breaking length , the noise induced current is of the order @xmath57 .",
    "the noise induced current is paramagnetic for rings with strong spin - orbit coupling ( like in gold or copper ) , and is diamagnetic in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , and could thus be the explanation of the semiconductor experiments in ref .  13 .",
    "in the presence of impurities , in particular , whenever the defects have an internal structure , the persistent current may have a sizeable contribution through what can be called an `` effective interaction '' ; this mechanism was discussed , for example in refs .",
    "23 and 24 .",
    "we first consider the interaction of conduction electrons with nonmagnetic impurities , which we assume to couple to the electron density .",
    "the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath98 the operator @xmath99 that is due to the impurities , will be specified more explicitly below . to second order in this interaction one",
    "finds a correction to the free energy which is the sum of a hartree and a fock like term , @xmath100 .",
    "we concentrate on the hartree term given by ( @xmath101 ) @xmath102   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the brackets @xmath103 are the thermal average . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eqcoulomb ] ) and ( [ hartree ] ) one realizes that the coulomb interaction is replaced by an effective interaction , @xmath104\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] mediated by the defects .",
    "if @xmath99 describes pure potential scattering , then @xmath99 is a c - number with the result that this effective interaction vanishes .",
    "the situation is more interesting whenever the impurity has an internal degree of freedom .",
    "for a two - level system , for example , which may be realized by an impurity which sits in a double well potential with nearly degenerate minima at @xmath105 and @xmath106 , we write the scattering potential as @xmath107 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 are the number operators for the impurity in the respective potential minimum . since the impurity is in either of these minima , @xmath110 .",
    "next we average the interaction over the fermi surface .",
    "the dimensionless interaction `` constant '' , i.e. the analog to @xmath47 defined earlier for the coulomb interaction , reads @xmath111 , \\ ] ] with @xmath112 $ ] , and @xmath13 the volume . in absence of spin - orbit scattering the zero temperature persistent current",
    "thus is obtained as @xmath113 in the presence of strong spin - orbit scattering this result has to be divided by four . in order to calculate @xmath114 explicitly ,",
    "we need details of the impurity hamiltonian .",
    "we characterize the impurity by an asymmetry @xmath115 , and a tunneling amplitude @xmath116 .",
    "the relevant correlation function is given by @xmath117 = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{lc } { 1\\over 4 } { 1\\over k t }   & \\\\",
    "{ 1\\over 4 } { \\delta^2 \\over \\epsilon^2 + \\delta^2 } { 1\\over \\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\delta^2 } } &     \\end{array } \\right . \\ ! \\ ! \\ !   \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! , \\ ] ] in the two limits @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , respectively . for a given concentration @xmath120 of two - level systems ,",
    "we find under the standard assumption@xcite of a flat distribution of @xmath115 between zero and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , and a distribution of @xmath123 that is proportional to @xmath124 between @xmath125 and @xmath126 , the result @xmath127 .",
    "this number should be of the order one , for this mechanism to be relevant for the persistent current experiments considered above .",
    "estimates , however , are difficult due to the large number of parameters .",
    "although the required density of tls is not unreasonable@xcite , it has been objected@xcite  in another context  that the required concentration is larger than typical values in metallic glasses .    certainly the estimate could be improved if some of the parameters could be determined experimentally . in ref .",
    "20 it has been demonstrated that in the presence of a sufficient number of tls , the electron dephasing rate becomes temperature independent in a certain range of temperature . the dephasing rate is@xcite @xmath128 with @xmath129 . in an experiment where this mechanism is responsible for dephasing , we can express the persistent current amplitude , @xmath130 , in terms of the experimentally accessible dephasing rate as @xmath131 in the two limits considered .",
    "a possible candidate is the gold sample of ref .  11 : below @xmath132 mk the dephasing rate is @xmath133-independent with @xmath134 mk . for the mechanism considered here ,",
    "the lowest measured temperature ( @xmath135 mk ) is an upper limit for @xmath136 .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath137 .",
    "note that the persistent current from tls mediated interactions is diamagnetic , and could thus be responsible for the diamagnetic @xmath138 in the array of gold rings of refs .",
    "11 and 12 .",
    "finally , it is of course important to consider magnetic impurities . first , these are difficult to avoid in preparing the experimental samples , and thus magnetic defects often have to be taken into account for the interpretation of the results .",
    "second , however , magnetic impurities are well suited to change the properties in an controlled way .",
    "thus , in order to check the predictions given in this section , we would strongly encourage such experiments .",
    "the sensitivity of quantum coherence with respect to magnetic scattering is well known .",
    "magnetic impurities suppress quantum interference from time reversed paths .",
    "therefore one expects that the average persistent current in the presence of magnetic impurities is suppressed ; explicitly @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the spin - flip scattering time . on the other hand the coupling of the conduction electrons with a local spin",
    ", @xmath141 will induce an effective , spin - dependent electron - electron interaction , @xmath142\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which may enhance the persistent current .",
    "the effective interaction is proportional to the impurity susceptibility @xmath143 .",
    "this quantity , in weak magnetic fields , is proportional to the inverse temperature , at least when kondo correlations and spin - spin interactions are neglected .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show the persistent current in the presence of the magnetic impurities and for strong spin - orbit scattering , which is relevant for gold or copper .",
    "the current was obtained by adding to eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) the impurity induced current as given in ref .",
    "notice the qualitative difference of the results for negative interaction parameter @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , compared to positive @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . in the first case",
    ", a low concentration of magnetic impurities strongly suppresses the current , and at very low temperature there is a change in sign . in the second case , where the persistent current in the absence of magnetic impurities is paramagnetic , the current",
    "is not reduced by a low concentration of impurities ; at low temperature it is even enhanced considerably .",
    "one decade after the first experimental observation of persistent currents in normal conducting rings the central question is still open : which mechanism is responsible for the amplitude of the current ?",
    "existing theories capture correctly certain aspects of the experimental observations , like the periodicity , the scale of the amplitude of the current and its temperature dependence .",
    "nevertheless a theory of disordered electrons including the coulomb interaction seems not to be complete .    in this article",
    "we summarized recent ideas of the relationship between persistent currents and dephasing .",
    "all mechanisms considered have one feature in common : if there is enough noise , ( two - level systems , magnetic impurities ) in order to explain the experimentally observed dephasing , then the noise is sufficient to explain the observed amplitude of the persistent current .",
    "experimentally the relation between dephasing and persistent currents may be checked by measuring the persistent current for different materials . for silver ,",
    "where no saturation of the dephasing time has been observed@xcite , we expect a smaller persistent current than in gold or copper where the dephasing time saturates at low temperature .",
    "we also suggest a study of the persistent current in samples doped with magnetic impurities .",
    "by varying the impurity concentration one controls the strength of the impurity - mediated electron - electron interaction . for the gold rings of refs .",
    "11 and 12 for example , we predict a sign change of the @xmath46 current with increasing concentration of magnetic impurities .",
