    "the paradigm of cosmic inflation  @xcite is one of the main pillars of modern cosmology .",
    "not only does inflation account for the vast size of the observable universe and its high degree of homogeneity and isotropy on cosmological scales ; it also seeds the post - inflationary formation of structure on galactic scales . in this sense",
    ", inflation is a key aspect of our cosmic past and part of the reason why our universe is capable of harboring life . from the perspective of particle physics ,",
    "the origin of inflation is , however , rather unclear .",
    "after decades of model building , there exists a plethora of inflation models in the literature  @xcite . but",
    "a consensus about how to embed inflation into particle physics is out of sight . in this situation",
    ", it seems appropriate to take a step back and ask ourselves what avenues have been left unexplored so far . in particular , we should question our dearly cherished prejudices and re - examine whether inflation might not be connected to other high - energy phenomena which , up to now , have been taken to be mostly unrelated to inflation . as we are going to demonstrate in this paper ,",
    "an important example in this respect might be the interplay between inflation and the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry ( susy ) .    in recent years",
    ", the picture of supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy problem has become increasingly challenged by the experimental data .",
    "the null results of susy searches at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite and the rather large standard model ( sm ) higgs boson mass of a @xmath4  @xcite indicate that supersymmetry , if it exists in nature , must be broken at a high scale  @xcite . based on this observation",
    ", one could feel tempted to give up on supersymmetry as an extension of the standard model altogether .",
    "but this would not do justice to supersymmetry s other virtues . provided",
    "that supersymmetry is broken at a high scale  @xcite , such as in the minimal framework of pure gravity mediation ( pgm )  @xcite , it may no longer be responsible for stabilizing the electroweak scale .",
    "but in this case , supersymmetry is still capable of providing a viable candidate for dark matter  @xcite , ensuring the unification of the sm gauge couplings  @xcite and setting the stage for a uv completion of the standard model in the context of string theory .",
    "in addition , high - scale supersymmetry does not suffer from a number of phenomenological problems that low - scale realizations of supersymmetry breaking are plagued with .",
    "a high susy breaking scale does away with the cosmological gravitino problem  @xcite and reduces the tension with constraints on flavor - changing neutral currents and @xmath5 violation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in pgm , the susy - breaking ( or `` polonyi '' ) field is required to be a non - singlet  @xcite , which solves the cosmological polonyi problem  @xcite .    in this paper , we will now concentrate our attention to yet another intriguing feature of supersymmetry which comes into reach , once we let go of the notion that supersymmetry s main purpose is to solve the hierarchy problem in the standard model .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry at a scale @xmath6 results in a nonzero contribution to the total vacuum energy density , @xmath7 .",
    "if we allow @xmath6 to take values as large as , say , the unification scale , @xmath8 , this susy - breaking vacuum energy density might , in fact , be the origin of the inflationary phase in the early universe !",
    "such a connection between inflation and supersymmetry breaking not only appears economical , but also very natural .",
    "first of all , supersymmetry tends to render inflation technically more natural , independent of the scale at which it is broken .",
    "thanks to the susy nonrenormalization theorem  @xcite , the superpotential @xmath9 in supersymmetric models of inflation does not receive any radiative corrections in perturbation theory .",
    "this represents an important advantage in preserving the required flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "besides , all remaining radiative corrections ( which can be collected in an effective khler potential @xmath10 to leading order  @xcite ) scale with the soft susy - breaking mass scale  @xcite and are , thus , under theoretical control .",
    "supersymmetry , therefore , has the ability to stabilize the inflaton potential against radiative corrections ; and it is , thus , conceivable that supersymmetry s actual importance may lie in the fact that it is capable of taming the hierarchy among different mass scales in the inflaton sector rather than in the standard model .",
    "second of all , the spontaneous breaking of global supersymmetry via nonvanishing f - terms , i.e. , via the oraifeartaigh mechanism  @xcite , always results in a pseudoflat direction in the scalar potential  @xcite .",
    "together with the constant vacuum energy density @xmath7 , such a flat potential for a scalar field is exactly one of the crucial requirements for the successful realization of an inflationary stage in the early universe . in principle",
    ", the necessary ingredients for inflation are , therefore , already intrinsic features of every oraifeartaigh model .",
    "inflation may be driven by the susy - breaking vacuum energy density @xmath7 and the inflaton field may be identified with the pseudoflat direction in the scalar potential .",
    "the main obstacle in implementing this idea in realistic models is gravity . here , the crucial point is that the vanishingly small value of the cosmological constant ( cc ) tells us that we live in a near - minkowski vacuum with an almost zero total vacuum energy density , @xmath11 .",
    "note that , as pointed out by weinberg , this not a mere observation , but a necessary condition for a sufficient amount of structure formation in our universe , so that it can support life  @xcite . in the context of supergravity ( sugra )",
    "@xcite , the fact that @xmath11 means that the susy - breaking vacuum energy density @xmath7 must be balanced , with very high precision , by a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the superpotential , @xmath12 , @xmath13 \\frac{\\left<\\left|w\\right|\\right>^2}{m_{\\rm pl}^2 } \\simeq 0   \\ , , \\quad \\left<\\left|f\\right|\\right > = \\lambda_{\\rm susy}^2 \\ , ,   \\label{eq : min}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the reduced planck mass . if the susy breaking scale @xmath6 is indeed of @xmath15 , the requirement of a zero cc results in a huge vev of the superpotential , which , in turn , generates dangerously large sugra corrections to the scalar potential .",
    "these corrections then easily spoil the flatness of the potential and render inflation impossible  @xcite .",
    "the most attractive and , in fact , only way out of this problem is @xmath0 symmetry . under @xmath0 symmetry ,",
    "the superpotential carries charge @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 , as long as @xmath0 symmetry is preserved  @xcite . in other words , by imposing @xmath0 symmetry , we promote @xmath12 to the order parameter of spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking , in analogy to @xmath18 which acts as the order parameter of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking . in the true vacuum ,",
    "@xmath0 symmetry must be broken , so that @xmath19 , in order to satisfy the condition in eq .  .",
    "but this does not necessarily mean that @xmath12 must be nonzero during the entire cosmological evolution .",
    "it is conceivable that , at early times , @xmath0 symmetry is , in fact , a good symmetry , so that @xmath20 , thereby `` switching off '' the most dangerous sugra corrections to the polonyi potential .",
    "the main intention of our paper now is to present a minimal dynamical model , in which this is indeed the case , so that inflation driven by the susy - breaking vacuum energy density , i.e. , _",
    "polonyi inflation _ , becomes a viable option .",
    "let us now outline our general philosophy in , to some extent , simplified terms .",
    "we suppose that , from the perspective of the low - energy effective theory , the breaking of supersymmetry and @xmath0 symmetry are two distinct dynamical processes , taking place in two different hidden sectors at two different times , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we assume that the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 may be sampled in the uv theory , so that in some patches of the early universe ( or in the landscape of string vacua  @xcite for that purpose ) @xmath23 and in other patches @xmath24 .",
    "note that this differentiation equally includes the case of a maximally symmetric initial state , @xmath25 , as well as the possibility that either supersymmetry or @xmath0 symmetry is already broken from the very beginning , @xmath26 .",
    "our crucial observation is that regions in space where @xmath0 symmetry is broken before supersymmetry correspond to bubbles of anti - de sitter ( ads ) space with an ads radius @xmath27 equal to the inverse of the gravitino mass @xmath28 , while regions in space where supersymmetry is broken before @xmath0 symmetry correspond to bubbles of de sitter ( ds ) space with a ds radius @xmath29 equal to the inverse of the hubble parameter @xmath30 , @xmath31 \\left<\\left|w\\right|\\right>/m_{\\rm pl}^2 \\ , , \\label{eq : bubbles } \\\\",
    "\\nonumber t_{\\rm susy } < t_r \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad & \\textrm{\\phantom{a}ds bubbles with radius } r_{\\rm ds } = h^{-1 }   \\ , , & h & = \\left<\\left|f\\right|\\right>/\\sqrt{3}/m_{\\rm pl } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as long as supersymmetry is unbroken , the ads bubbles represent open friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universes with a negative cc and an oscillatory scale factor .",
    "the ds bubbles , on the other hand , turn , as long as @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken , into ( asymptotically ) flat flrw universes with a positive cc and an exponentially growing scale factor  @xcite .",
    "this is to say that the ds bubbles experience inflation , while the ads bubbles remain limited in their spatial extent .",
    "furthermore , if we suppose that there is no other source of inflation present in the theory , this means that the ads bubbles will never develop into habitable universes .",
    "intelligent observers and humans can , therefore , only life in regions where , initially , @xmath0 symmetry remains unbroken up to a certain high energy scale .",
    "this applies , in particular , to our own observable universe . under the above assumptions , the inflationary period in the early history of our universe must have been a consequence of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and @xmath0 symmetry",
    "must have been broken only at late times , i.e. , after a sufficient amount of inflation .",
    "put differently , we can say that supersymmetry breaking and weinberg s argument regarding the size of the cc _ postdict _ a period of inflation and late - time @xmath0 symmetry breaking in our cosmic past .",
    "this conclusion also sheds new light on the role of the cc itself .",
    "the fine - tuning of the cc is now a dynamical process that takes place only after inflation . in order to obtain zero cc",
    ", we have to require that the gravitino mass generated during @xmath0 symmetry breaking matches the inflationary hubble rate , and @xmath32 in our scenario is conceptually quite different from other inflation models , such as , e.g. , the one in  @xcite , where @xmath33 on purely phenomenological grounds . in our case",
    ", @xmath33 is a property of the low - energy effective lagrangian of our universe that ensures that we live in a vacuum with an almost zero cc . ]",
    "@xmath34 if @xmath0 symmetry breaking results in a gravitino mass smaller than @xmath32 , inflation never ends ; if it `` overshoots '' and the gravitino mass is eventually larger than @xmath32 , our universe becomes ads .",
    "we , thus , recognize the requirement that inflation must terminate at one point or another as part of the reason why the cc in our universe is fine - tuned .",
    "a certain amount of fine - tuning during late - time @xmath0 symmetry breaking is inevitable , as inflation would otherwise not exit into a near - minkowski vacuum .",
    "this situation needs to be contrasted with standard scenarios of inflation , such as chaotic  @xcite or hybrid  @xcite inflation , where the vacuum energy density driving inflation is neither related to @xmath0 symmetry breaking nor to low - energy supersymmetry breaking .",
    "these scenarios require an independent reason for the vanishing of the inflationary vacuum energy density ( e.g. , a tuning of the inflaton potential or some kind of waterfall transition ) , whereas in our case this reason is already inherent to the fine - tuning of the cc in the course of spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking at the end of inflation .",
    "the above reasoning is just a rough sketch . to construct a realistic model of polonyi inflation",
    ", we need to be more specific .",
    "this pertains , first of all , to the kind of @xmath0 symmetry that we have in mind .",
    "naively , our first attempt might be to protect @xmath12 by means of a global @xmath35 symmetry . on general grounds ,",
    "quantum gravity is , however , expected to explicitly break all global symmetries ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , so that a global @xmath35 does not appear to be a viable possibility .",
    "meanwhile , gauging a continuous @xmath0 symmetry is a subtle issue that easily results in conflicts with anomaly constraints at low energies ( see  @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "this leaves us with a _",
    "discrete _ gauged ( i.e. , anomaly - free  @xcite ) @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath36 , as a unique choice to ensure the vanishing of the superpotential at early times .",
    "interestingly enough , such a discrete @xmath0 symmetry readily comes with a number of other advantages in the context of susy phenomenology : ( i ) a discrete @xmath0 symmetry prevents too rapid proton decay via perilous dimension-5 operators  @xcite ; ( ii ) it may give rise to an accidental approximate global peccei - quinn symmetry and , thus , help in solving the strong @xmath5 problem  @xcite ; ( iii ) and it may account for the approximate global continuous @xmath0 symmetry which is required to realize stable  @xcite or meta - stable  @xcite susy - breaking vacua in a large class of models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking ( dsb ) .",
    "moreover , if we restrict ourselves to the special case of a @xmath37 symmetry , @xmath0 symmetry can also help us in solving the @xmath38 problem  @xcite in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "any discrete @xmath0 symmetry suppresses the bilinear higgs mass term ( i.e. , the @xmath38 term ) in the superpotential .",
    "but only in the case of a @xmath37 symmetry , we are , in addition , allowed to include a higgs bilinear term in the khler potential , @xmath39 ( see @xcite and references therein for an extended discussion of this point ) .",
    "we are then able to generate the @xmath38 term in the course of @xmath0 symmetry breaking  @xcite , which directly relates the @xmath38 parameter to the gravitino mass .",
    "problem is not to be confused with the giudice - masiero mechanism  @xcite , which relates the generation of the @xmath38 term to the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry rather than to @xmath0 symmetry breaking . ]",
    "it is for this reason that we will assume a discrete @xmath37 symmetry in the following .    for our purposes",
    ", it will not be necessary to specify the origin of this @xmath37 symmetry .",
    "but it is interesting to note that orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string have the ability to yield discrete @xmath0 symmetries in the low - energy effective theory . in this case , the discrete @xmath0 symmetry at low energies is nothing but a remnant of the higher - dimensional lorentz symmetry that survives the compactification of the internal space ( for early as well as more recent work on this topic , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "we also mention that the special case of a discrete @xmath37 symmetry has received particular attention in the context of orbifold compactifications in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a discrete @xmath37 symmetry in the low - energy effective theory is , therefore , well motivated and stands theoretically on a sound footing .",
    "second of all , inflation is more than just a pure ds phase .",
    "it represents a stage of quasi - ds expansion , in the course of which the hubble parameter slowly varies .",
    "we , thus , need to specify the dynamics of supersymmetry breaking more precisely and check whether the corresponding polonyi potential is , in fact , suitable for slow - roll inflation . here",
    ", we shall work within the framework of dynamical supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , in which supersymmetry is assumed to be broken by the dynamics of a strongly coupled susy gauge theory .",
    "this gives us the advantage that the susy breaking scale @xmath6 is generated dynamically via dimensional transmutation .",
    "as far as supersymmetry breaking is concerned , we will , therefore , not have to rely on any dimensionful input parameters .",
    "instead , @xmath6 and , thus , the energy scale of inflation , @xmath40 , will be controlled by the dynamical scale @xmath41 of the susy - breaking hidden sector , @xmath42 in this sense , our inflation model should be regarded as a variant of _ dynamical inflation _",
    "@xcite , as we assume the energy scale of inflation to be generated by strong dynamics .",
    "similarly , our model is closely related to _ natural inflation _",
    "@xcite , which treats the inflaton as an axion - like field that is likewise subject to a scalar potential generated by nonperturbative dynamics ( for recent dynamical implementations of natural inflation in field theory , see  @xcite ) , as well as to _",
    "modulus inflation _",
    "@xcite , where one identifies the inflaton as a ( composite ) modulus in the effective low - energy regime of strongly coupled gauge theories .    in our case ,",
    "the role of the inflaton is played by the scalar component of the chiral polonyi field @xmath43 , which breaks supersymmetry via its nonzero @xmath44-term . in global supersymmetry and at the classical level ,",
    "the scalar polonyi potential is exactly flat and , thus , an ideal starting point for the realization of inflation . at the quantum level and in supergravity , the polonyi potential",
    ", however , receives corrections , which may or may not spoil the flatness of the potential . here , the sugra corrections lead , in particular , to the notorious @xmath45 problem  @xcite , which typically requires a parameter fine - tuning at the level of @xmath46 or so . the quantum and gravity corrections to the effective scalar potential scale with the coupling strengths of the yukawa interactions between the polonyi field and matter fields , @xmath47 , as well as with the coefficients of the higher - dimensional polonyi terms in the effective khler potential , @xmath48 , respectively . in order to assess the prospects of successful polonyi inflation , one , therefore , has to study the viability of inflation as a function of the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 and identify those parameter ranges that lead to consistency with the observational data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite .      to this end",
    ", we will present in this paper a _",
    "minimal _ realization of the idea of polonyi inflation .",
    "our model is based on two strongly coupled @xmath49 hidden gauge sectors ( featuring two quark / antiquark pairs each ) , which we take to be responsible for the dynamical breaking of supersymmetry and @xmath0 symmetry , respectively .",
    "we supplement both sectors with an appropriate number of gauge singlet fields , so that the susy - breaking sector becomes identical to the simplest version of the iyit dsb model  @xcite , while the @xmath0-symmetry breaking sector turns into a strongly coupled sqcd theory with a quantum mechanically deformed moduli space and field - dependent quark masses  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we assume the quark masses in the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking sector to be controlled by the vev of a singlet , which we call @xmath50 .",
    "inflation is then driven by the susy - breaking vacuum energy density in the iyit sector , which results in an inflaton potential equivalent to that of supersymmetric f - term hybrid inflation ( fhi )  @xcite , including corrections from supergravity  @xcite as well as from higher - dimensional terms in the tree - level khler potential  @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the inflation models presented in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the model in  @xcite , however , corresponds to a reduced version of the iyit model with less singlets , which leads to the vanishing of the inflationary vacuum energy at the end of inflation .",
    "contrary to our approach , it , thus , does not establish a connection between inflation and supersymmetry breaking .",
    "meanwhile , the model in  @xcite identifies a different singlet field , other than the polonyi field , as the inflaton .",
    "this allows the author of  @xcite to separate the scales of inflation and supersymmetry breaking by imposing a hierarchy among the yukawa couplings of the inflaton and the susy - breaking field .",
    "we , on the other hand , will show how to implement inflation into the full iyit model , sticking to the notion that the best motivated inflaton candidate in the iyit model is still the polonyi field itself .",
    "an important consequence of this approach is that , in our case , f - term hybrid inflation does _ not _ end in a waterfall transition in the inflationary sector .",
    "instead , we simply retain the inflationary vacuum energy density at low energies , which then continues to act as the vacuum energy density associated with the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "this also means that our `` waterfall transition - free '' scenario of f - term hybrid inflation does not suffer from the usual production of topological defects , such as cosmic strings in the case of a @xmath51 waterfall transition , which would otherwise exert some serious phenomenological pressure on our model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the susy - breaking sector and the @xmath0-symmetry breaking sector only communicate with each other via interactions in the khler potential ( i.e , not via interactions in the superpotential ) .",
    "this is sufficient to stabilize the scalar field @xmath50 during inflation at @xmath52 by means of its hubble - induced mass . during inflation , the ( fermionic ) quarks in the @xmath0-symmetry breaking sector are",
    ", therefore , massless and the discrete @xmath37 symmetry remains unbroken in this sector .",
    "as anticipated , the superpotential then lacks a constant term during inflation , which relieves the inflationary dynamics from the most dangerous gravitational corrections in supergravity .",
    "in particular , the inflaton potential is free of the notorious `` tadpole term '' linear in the inflaton field  @xcite . towards the end of inflation , the hubble - induced mass of the scalar field @xmath50 decreases .",
    "adding an appropriately chosen superpotential for the field @xmath50 , we can use this fact to trigger a waterfall transition _ in the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking sector _ at small inflaton field values .",
    "the field @xmath50 then acquires a large vev and the quarks in the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking sector become very massive .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking sector turns into a pure super - yang - mills ( sym ) theory and @xmath0 symmetry becomes spontaneously broken via gaugino condensation  @xcite .",
    "this external waterfall transition is associated with the breaking of a @xmath53 parity , which is , however , only an approximate symmetry .",
    "for this reason , we do not have to fear the production of topological defects ( i.e. , domain walls ) during the waterfall transition in the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "after these introductory remarks , we are now in the position to present our analysis .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will show how the iyit dsb model may give rise to dynamical f - term hybrid inflation . here , we will first argue why the original polonyi model  @xcite of supersymmetry breaking is _ not _ sufficient for a successful realization of polonyi inflation , even if we assume zero constant in the superpotential during inflation .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that we only have a chance of successfully realizing polonyi inflation in the presence of radiative corrections  which leads us to consider the iyit model as a possible uv completion of the original polonyi model .",
    "we then derive the scalar potential of f - term hybrid inflation in the iyit model and discuss its embedding into supergravity . as an interesting aside , we demonstrate that polonyi inflation is incompatible with the concept of an approximate shift symmetry in the inflaton direction  @xcite . instead , it turns out that polonyi inflation requires a near - canonical khler potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rbreaking ] , we expand on our mechanism of late - time @xmath0 symmetry breaking , showing how a small inflaton field value may trigger gaugino condensation in a separate hidden sector .",
    "related to that , we comment on the backreaction of the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking sector on the inflationary dynamics and discuss how the two sectors of supersymmetry and @xmath0 symmetry breaking have to conspire to yield a zero cc in the true vacuum after inflation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] , we turn to the phenomenological implications of our scenario . here , we identify the viable region in parameter space that leads to agreement with the latest planck data on the inflationary cmb observables  @xcite . as we are able to show , a scalar spectral index of @xmath54 can be easily achieved for an @xmath55 yukawa coupling , @xmath56 , and a slightly suppressed coefficient in the noncanonical khler potential , @xmath57 .",
    "the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum , @xmath58 , fixes the dynamical scale of the susy - breaking sector to a value close to the unification scale , @xmath59 , suggesting that our setup may eventually be part of a grand unified theory ( gut ) . as a characteristic feature of polonyi inflation",
    ", we highlight the fact that the relation between the gravitino mass and the inflationary hubble rate in eq .",
    "directly translates into a one - to - one correspondence between the gravitino mass @xmath28 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath60 , @xmath61 at this point , it is interesting to note that the observed value of the scalar spectral amplitude , @xmath62 , might be the result of anthropic selection  @xcite .",
    "together with the paradigm of slow - roll inflation ( which implies @xmath63 ) , the anthropic value of @xmath58 could , therefore , explain why the soft susy mass scale is so much higher than the electroweak or tev scale .",
    "moreover , we point out in sec .  [",
    "sec : pheno ] that , after inflation , the polonyi field mostly decays into gravitinos .",
    "polonyi inflation is , thus , followed by a phase of gravitino domination  @xcite , which leads to reheating around temperatures of @xmath64 .",
    "this paves the way for thermal wino dark matter ( dm ) as well as thermal leptogenesis  @xcite enhanced by resonance effects  @xcite .",
    "appendix  [ app : potential ] contains some technical details regarding the derivation of the effective inflaton potential .",
    "in particular , we show how the one - loop corrections to the effective potential may be obtained , to leading order , from an effective khler potential . in appendix",
    "[ app : viability ] , we explain in more detail why polonyi inflation in the iyit model does not work , if the superpotential already contains a constant term from the very beginning .",
    "this completes our argument that , in the context of our minimal model , successful polonyi inflation requires ( i ) radiative corrections , ( ii ) a near - canonical khler potential , ( iii ) as well as late - time @xmath0 symmetry breaking . among all possible choices regarding ( i ) the type of interactions that the polonyi field participates in , ( ii ) the shape of the khler potential , and ( iii ) the chronology of supersymmetry and @xmath0 symmetry breaking , this leave one unique possibility for how to realize polonyi inflation .",
    "the polonyi model  @xcite is the simplest oraifeartaigh model of supersymmetry breaking via a nonvanishing f - term .",
    "its superpotential consists of a tadpole term and a constant , @xmath65 here , @xmath43 denotes the chiral polonyi field , @xmath38 is the scale of supersymmetry breaking and @xmath66 is a constant that breaks @xmath0 symmetry and which determines the potential energy density in the ground state . for a canonical khler potential and fine - tuning @xmath66 , so that it takes the particular value @xmath67 , this model has a minkowski vacuum at @xmath68 , in which supersymmetry is broken by the polonyi f - term , @xmath69 .",
    "it has been known for a long time , that the scalar potential for the polonyi field around this vacuum is unfortunately too steep to support slow - roll inflation  @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ app : viability ] , we review and extend this argument , showing for various choices of the khler potential , that , with @xmath70 from the very beginning , the polonyi model does not give rise to inflation .",
    "we consider , in particular , a canonical khler potential supplemented by higher - dimensional corrections as well as khler potentials featuring an approximate shift symmetry either along the real or the imaginary axis in the complex plane . in none of the cases under consideration inflation",
    "is viable  either because we fail to satisfy the slow - roll conditions or because the scalar potential does not exhibit a global minkowski vacuum in the first place .",
    "this immediately raises the question whether inflation might perhaps become possible in the polonyi model , if we impose a discrete @xmath0 symmetry at high energies , so that @xmath71 initially .",
    "let us address this question for a canonical khler potential supplemented by a higher - dimensional correction , , we will discuss the same question for an approximately shift - symmetric khler potential . in this case",
    ", inflation turns out be unfeasible because , with the superpotential being given as @xmath72 , the @xmath73\\left|w\\right|^2/m_{\\rm pl}^2 $ ] sugra term in the scalar potential induces a tachyonic mass for the polonyi field .",

    "consider the slow - roll parameters @xmath82 and @xmath45 , @xmath83 independent of the sign of @xmath48 , we have @xmath84 . for negative @xmath48 ,",
    "the slow - roll parameter @xmath45 is , therefore , bound to be positive , while the slow - roll parameter @xmath82 turns out to be negligibly small during inflation , @xmath85 .",
    "according to the slow - roll formula for the scalar spectral index , @xmath86 , we will then always obtain a blue - tilted scalar spectrum ( @xmath87 ) . in view of the latest best - fit value for @xmath88 reported by the planck collaboration ,",
    "@xmath89  @xcite , such a spectrum is clearly ruled out by the observational data . on the other hand ,",
    "if we choose @xmath48 to be positive , the polonyi field acquires a tachyonic mass around the origin and inflation proceeds from small to large field values , similarly as in new inflation  @xcite .",
    "it is then hard to imagine how the generation of the constant @xmath66 in the superpotential should be triggered , after a sufficient amount of inflation , at field values close or even above the planck scale .",
    "but more than that , even if we assume that this problem could somehow be solved , the scalar potential in eq .   still does not lead to an acceptable phenomenology . in new inflation ,",
    "the scalar spectral index turns out to be bounded from above , @xmath90",
    "@xcite , which deviates from the observed value by at least @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , also for @xmath92 , we fail to reach consistency with the observational data .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the _ bare polonyi model _ based on the superpotential in eq .",
    "and for reasonable anstze regarding the shape of the khler potential  does not allow for a successful realization of slow - roll inflation .",
    "in respect of this null result , two comments are in order : ( i ) we emphasize that our analysis of the polonyi khler potential in this paper does _ not _ mount up to a general no - go theorem . in the most general case ,",
    "the khler potential for the polonyi field is given by an arbitrary function @xmath44 of the field @xmath43 and its conjugate , @xmath93 . in absence of any other scale , it is , in particular , clear that @xmath94 can be the only relevant scale in the khler potential .",
    "it may then well be that certain fine - tuned functions @xmath44 do allow for successful inflation in the polonyi model , after all ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a discussion of fine - tuned khler potentials in the context of sugra models of inflation ) .",
    "in the following , we will , however , ignore the possibility of such a biasedly chosen khler potential and focus on the usual suspects : khler potentials that are either near - canonical or approximately shift - symmetric .",
    "( ii ) the fact that we are unable to realize successful inflation in the bare polonyi model is not a serious problem , as the polonyi model is not expected to be a fundamental description of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking , anyway .",
    "it should rather be seen as the effective theory resulting from some uv dynamics that provide a dynamical explanation for the origin of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath66 in eq .  .",
    "from this perspective , it is then more likely than not that the polonyi field is not only subject to its gravitational self - interaction , but that it also participates in yukawa interactions with heavy matter fields in the uv theory . in the corresponding _ effective polonyi model _ at low energies , these matter fields are integrated out , so that they no longer appear in the superpotential .",
    "but their couplings to the polonyi field still yield radiative corrections to the scalar potential in eq .  , which affect the inflationary dynamics .",
    "in such a modified setup , i.e. , in the original polonyi model supplemented by radiative corrections , successful polonyi inflation may , therefore , very well be an option . in the following",
    ", we will construct a minimal extension of the polonyi model where this is indeed the case .",
    "we shall consider a minimal uv completion of the polonyi model  consisting of two strongly coupled @xmath49 sectors that account for the dynamical origin of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath66 , respectively  and demonstrate that , in the presence of radiative corrections , successful polonyi inflation is indeed feasible for a natural choice of parameters values .",
    "one of the simplest ways to generate the susy breaking scale @xmath38 in eq .   is to identify the polonyi field as part of the iyit model  the simplest vector - like model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking  @xcite . in its most general formulation ,",
    "the iyit model is based on a strongly coupled @xmath95 gauge theory featuring @xmath96 pairs of `` quark fields '' @xmath97 that transform in the fundamental representation of @xmath95 .",

    "naive dimensionful analysis _  @xcite leads us to expect that @xmath45 should be of @xmath101 and , for definiteness , we will , therefore , simply set @xmath102 in the following .",
    "the quantum moduli space of the iyit model is subject to the following constraint pertaining to the meson vevs , @xmath103 which represents the quantum mechanically deformed version of the classical constraint @xmath104  @xcite . in order to break supersymmetry in the iyit model",
    ", one has to lift the flat directions @xmath99 , so that eq .   is longer compatible with a vanishing vacuum energy density .",
    "this is readily done by coupling the quark pairs @xmath105 to a corresponding number of @xmath95 singlet fields , @xmath106 , in the tree - level superpotential , @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes a matrix of yukawa couplings with at most @xmath109 independent eigenvalues .",
    "these yukawa couplings induce dirac mass terms for the meson and singlet fields at low energies , @xmath110 so that the singlet f - term conditions , @xmath111 , are incompatible with the deformed moduli constraint , @xmath112 .",

    "the continuous @xmath0 symmetry of the iyit model is , of course , only an approximate symmetry , which we expect to be broken by quantum gravitational effects  @xcite .",

    "from now on , let us restrict ourselves to the simplest version of the iyit model : a strongly coupled @xmath124 gauge theory featuring four matter fields @xmath97 and six singlet fields @xmath106 .",

    "but in view of the recent experimental data , we now begin to realize that supersymmetry s main purpose may actually not lie in stabilizing the electroweak scale .",
    "instead , it now appears more likely that supersymmetry is , in fact , spontaneously broken at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "this opens up a whole range of new phenomenological possibilities .",
    "as we have demonstrated in this paper , the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry at a high scale , @xmath703 , may , e.g. , offer a dynamical explanation for the occurrence of cosmic inflation in the early universe . we have dubbed the ensuing inflationary scenario _ polonyi inflation _ , as it identifies cosmic inflation as a natural by - product of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in an effective polonyi model . generally speaking , the key idea of our proposal is to obtain inflation from the polonyi superpotential , @xmath704 with the polonyi superfield @xmath43 breaking supersymmetry via its nonvanishing f - term , @xmath705 , and acting as the chiral inflaton field at the same time . in the context of polonyi inflation ,",
    "spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and cosmic inflation are nothing but two sides of the same coin : inflation is driven by the vacuum energy density associated with the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry and the scalar inflaton is identified as the complex polonyi field , i.e. , the pseudoflat direction in the scalar potential of the susy - breaking sector .",
    "this connection between supersymmetry breaking and inflation results in several characteristic parameter relations that cast a new light on well - known quantities .",
    "in polonyi inflation , the hubble rate during inflation , e.g. , is equal to the gravitino mass at low energies , @xmath706 this implies that the amplitude of the primordial density fluctuations , @xmath707 , scales with @xmath28 , @xmath708 there are indications that the observed value of @xmath707 might be the result of anthropic selection  @xcite .",
    "given typical values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath60 in slow - roll inflation , the above relation then points towards very large values of the gravitino mass . in polonyi inflation ,",
    "the ultimate reason why supersymmetry is broken at a high scale , therefore , consists in the necessity of reproducing the anthropic value of @xmath707 . the general concept of polonyi inflation , thus , not only yields an answer to the question _ `` why inflation ? ''",
    "_ , it also explains why supersymmetry is necessarily broken at a very high scale .",
    "moreover , we point out that @xmath709 is an interesting result in view of the stability of the sm higgs potential . recall that , solely within the standard model , the higgs quartic coupling ( most likely ) turns negative at energies around @xmath710  @xcite .",
    "this instability can be remedied by supersymmetry ",
    "as long as the soft sparticle masses are at most of @xmath646 . in this sense ,",
    "our result for @xmath28 turns out to saturate the upper bound on the gravitino mass implied by vacuum stability !",
    "this may or may not be a coincidence .    in this paper ,",
    "we have constructed a minimal model that illustrates how the idea of polonyi inflation may be realized in the context of strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "our construction consists of two separate hidden sectors that respectively account for the dynamical origin of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath66 in eq .  . here",
    ", one hidden sector is identical to the simplest version of the iyit model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this sector contains the polonyi field @xmath43 and is responsible for the generation of the susy - breaking parameter @xmath38 via strong dynamics .",
    "the other hidden sector features the same matter content as the susy - breaking sector , but contains less singlet fields .",
    "the masses of the matter fields in this sector are controlled by the vev of a singlet field @xmath50 . at early times , @xmath385 vanishes . at this time , the constant in the superpotential , @xmath346 , is zero .",
    "as we are able to show , the effective scalar potential for the polonyi field at this stage then takes the same form as the inflaton potential of ordinary f - term hybrid inflation in the limit of a vanishing gravitino mass .",
    "it is this potential that gives rise to the actual period of polonyi inflation.albeit , in the true vacuum at low energies , @xmath28 is exceptionally large in our model . ] at small polonyi field values after the end of slow - roll inflation , the hubble - induced mass for the field @xmath50 decreases  until , at a certain field value , @xmath50 becomes tachyonically unstable .",
    "this instability results in a waterfall transition in the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking sector , such that @xmath711 .",
    "the second hidden sector then turns into a pure sym theory , in which @xmath0 symmetry is broken via gaugino condensation . in consequence of that",
    ", the constant term @xmath66 appears in the superpotential . here , the final value of @xmath66 needs to be fine - tuned , such that the cc in the true vacuum vanishes .    to sum up",
    ", we conclude that our effective polonyi model results in an inflationary scenario similar to ordinary f - term hybrid inflation , apart from a few key differences : ( i ) all corrections to the scalar potential proportional to @xmath28 are missing in our model .",
    "( ii ) this means , in particular , that the scalar potential does not contain any odd powers of the inflaton field . because of that , the inflaton potential does not depend on the complex phase of the inflaton field , as it is usually the case in f - term hybrid inflation .",
    "( iii ) moreover , in our scenario , the low - energy value of the gravitino mass,@xmath28 , is not bounded from above by the inflationary hubble rate .",
    "in polonyi inflation , these two scales are , in fact , equal to each other , @xmath644 , whereas in f - term hybrid inflation we have to demand that @xmath712 , so as to ensure that the slow - roll conditions do not get violated .",
    "( iv ) in polonyi inflation , the inflaton sector does not undergo a waterfall phase transition at the end of inflation . instead , the inflationary vacuum energy density continues to act as the vacuum energy density associated with the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry after inflation . ( v ) meanwhile , small inflaton field values trigger a ( harmless ) waterfall phase transition in a separate hidden sector , in the course of which only an approximate global @xmath53 symmetry becomes broken .",
    "in contrast to f - term hybrid inflation , polonyi inflation , therefore , does not suffer from the production of dangerous topological defects at the end of inflation .",
    "in the present paper , we have only touched on the phenomenological implications of our model and more work is certainly needed . for one thing ,",
    "the study of the inflationary phase may still be further refined .",
    "as it turns out , inflation takes place at field values only shortly below the planck scale in our model .",
    "inflaton terms of @xmath713 in the scalar potential may , therefore , have a noticeable effect on the predictions for the inflationary cmb observables .",
    "we do not expect these terms to change our conclusions qualitatively .",
    "but quantitatively , they may be relevant .",
    "for another thing , the end of inflation and the subsequent reheating phase require a closer examination .",
    "here , it would be interesting to study the implications of different interactions between the two hidden sectors in the khler potential more comprehensively . also , the actual dynamics of reheating deserve further investigation",
    ". our model does not suffer from the usual polonyi problem , as the decay of the polonyi field is identified with the first stage of the reheating process itself .",
    "but besides that , a dedicated study of reheating tracking the expansion of the universe during the transition to the radiation - dominated era as well as the oscillatory motion of all scalar fields is needed . here",
    ", particular attention should be paid to the study of all possible decay modes of the polonyi field as well as of the gravitino . a better understanding of reheating",
    "would then enable us to better assess the prospects of successful thermal leptogenesis .",
    "finally , the phenomenological implications of our model at low energies need to be explored in more detail . as examples of observational signatures at low energies ,",
    "we merely mention two interesting possibilities : ( i ) in our scenario , a wino lsp with an anthropically selected mass around 3 tev accounts for dark matter .",
    "this wino can be searched for in direct and indirect detection experiments . in addition",
    ", the almost mass - degenerate chargino may be seen in the form of macroscopic charged tracks in collider experiments .",
    "all in all , our model predicts that the neutral and the charged wino are the only sparticles that should show up at low energies .",
    "all other sparticles have masses of at least @xmath648 and are , thus , expected to be decoupled from low - energy phenomenology for the most part .",
    "( ii ) moreover , the discrete @xmath37 symmetry that we use to forbid the constant term in the superpotential at early times predicts the existence of vector - like matter fields charged under the sm gauge group , which cancel the sm contributions to the @xmath37 gauge anomalies .",
    "these vector - like matter fields may have masses within the reach of collider experiments , which would allow to probe our assumption of an anomaly - free @xmath0 symmetry at accessible energies .",
    "last but not least , one should attempt to implement our idea of polonyi inflation into other dynamical models . it would be interesting to assess which other dsb models apart from the iyit model might serve as a uv completion of the inflationary dynamics .",
    "in addition to that , a more systematic study of the polonyi khler potential  beyond near - canonical and approximately shift - symmetric khler potentials  would be desirable .",
    "maybe there are particular ( exotic ) choices for the khler potential that render it unnecessary to supplement the tree - level polonyi model with radiative corrections , as we have done it in this paper .",
    "likewise , our model of late - time @xmath0 symmetry breaking may be extended or supplemented by alternative means to generate the constant term in the superpotential at the end of inflation . as an alternative to our scenario , which employs the waterfall field @xmath50",
    ", one might consider a direct coupling of the polonyi field to the gauge fields of a strongly coupled pure sym theory via the gauge - kinetic function , @xmath714 for appropriately chosen values of the parameters @xmath715 and @xmath716 and the integer @xmath717 , the sym theory is weakly coupled during inflation , returning to the strongly coupled regime only at the end of inflation .",
    "this results in gaugino condensation and , hence , late - time @xmath0 symmetry breaking at @xmath718 .",
    "we will give a more careful discussion of this mechanism in the context of polonyi inflation elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , gaugino condensation in a pure sym theory is not the only way to break @xmath0 symmetry and other possibilities should be considered as well .",
    "eventually , the model presented in this paper may only be regarded as a first step towards a new understanding of the close relation between inflation and spontaneous supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the concept of polonyi inflation leads us into uncharted territory and we are convinced that , exploring these new avenues , we will encounter both big surprises and valuable insights .      at the early stages of this project ,",

    "<S> spontaneously broken supersymmetry ( susy ) and a vanishingly small cosmological constant imply that @xmath0 symmetry must be spontaneously broken at low energies . based on this observation , we suppose that , in the sector responsible for low - energy @xmath0 symmetry breaking , a discrete @xmath0 symmetry remains preserved at high energies and only becomes dynamically broken at relatively late times in the cosmological evolution , i.e. , after the dynamical breaking of susy . </S>",
    "<S> prior to @xmath0 symmetry breaking , the universe is then bound to be in a quasi - de sitter phase  which offers a dynamical explanation for the occurrence of cosmic inflation . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario yields a new perspective on the interplay between susy breaking and inflation , which neatly fits into the paradigm of high - scale susy : inflation is driven by the susy - breaking vacuum energy density , while the chiral field responsible for susy breaking , the polonyi field , serves as the inflaton . because @xmath0 symmetry is broken only after inflation , slow - roll inflation is not spoiled by otherwise dangerous gravitational corrections in supergravity . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our idea by means of a concrete example , in which both susy and @xmath0 symmetry are broken by strong gauge dynamics and in which late - time @xmath0 symmetry breaking is triggered by a small inflaton field value . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the scales of inflation and susy breaking are unified ; the inflationary predictions are similar to those of f - term hybrid inflation in supergravity ; reheating proceeds via gravitino decay at temperatures consistent with thermal leptogenesis ; and the sparticle mass spectrum follows from pure gravity mediation . </S>",
    "<S> dark matter consists of thermally produced winos with a mass in the tev range .    </S>",
