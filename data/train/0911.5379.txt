    "as we know , the light will be seriously absorbed when it passes through the optical medium , which is very bad for the conversion efficiency of the nonlinear optical processes .",
    "however , the situation has been changed since harris and his co - workers discovered the novel phenomenon of the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in a three - level atomic system in 1990s [ 1 ] .",
    "then the approaches of using the eit to control the absorptive and dispersive properties of atomic medium attract the attentions of many people .",
    "meanwhile , as one of the centerpieces of modern technology , the four - wave mixing ( fwm ) process based on the eit in the ultraslow propagation regime [ 2 - 11 ] has also attracted the attentions of many researchers for its potential applications in nonlinear spectroscopy at very low light intensity , quantum single - photon nonlinear optics , high - efficiency generation of short - wavelength coherent radiation at pump intensity approaching the single - photon level , and quantum information science .",
    "for instance , harris et al . proposed the use of eit to suppress absorption of the short - wavelength light generated in a fwm scheme and showed that the fwm efficiency could be greatly enhanced [ 12 ] .",
    "deng et al .",
    "proposed a fwm scheme based on eit and associated slow light propagation , and their calculations showed that a many orders of magnitude increase in the fwm efficiency may be obtained [ 13 ] .",
    "later on , wu et al . investigated and discussed a fwm scheme in a five - level atomic system by the use of eit , which led to suppressing both two - photon and three - photon absorptions in fwm scheme and enabling the fwm to proceed through real , resonant intermediate states without absorption loss [ 14 ] , and then he and his co - workers again analyzed a lifetime - broadened four - state fwm scheme in the ultraslow propagation regime and put forward a new type of induced transparency resulted from multiphoton destructive interference [ 15 ] .    on the other hand , some persons began to study the fwm schemes based on the two - eit in the ultraslow propagation regime recently [ 6,16 - 18 ] .",
    "for example , gong et al . showed a tripod - configuration fwm scheme for enhancement of fwm efficiency , and they found that the conversion efficiency of fwm enhanced several orders by adjusting the intensity of the coupling fields [ 16 ] .",
    "quite recently , huang et al . proposed a scheme to obtain a highly efficient fwm in a coherent five - level tripod system by using a double - dark resonance and multiphoton destructive interference induced transparency [ 17 ] .",
    "otherwise , zhang and xiao reported an experimental observation of optical pumping - assisted fwm and two - eit assisted swm .",
    "they found that the efficient swm could be selected by eit window and controlled by the coupling as well as dressed field detuning and power .",
    "due to the two - eit and optical pumping assistance , the enhanced swm signal was more than ten times lager than the coexisting fwm signal [ 18 ] .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a five - level @xmath0-configuration system based on the two electromagnetically induced transparency .",
    "our study and the system based on the refs .",
    "[ 14 - 15,16 - 18 ] , however , which are drastically different from those works .",
    "first and foremost is that we are interested in showing the effect of the external coherent driving field on both the relative intensity of the generated fwm field and the conversion efficiency of fwm .",
    "second , our atomic system is a kind of atomic configuration , which owns the property of the double - dark resonances .",
    "third , an important advantage of our scheme is that the high efficiency four - wave mixing can be easily controlled by adjusting the external coherent driving field .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the theoretical model and establish the corresponding schrdinger - maxwell equations . our numerical results and physical analyses are shown in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "some simple conclusions are given .",
    "we consider the five - level @xmath0-configuration system interacting with one weak , pulsed pump field , two cw laser pump fields , and an external coherent driving field as shown in fig .",
    "the transitions @xmath1  and @xmath2  are mediated by two laser pump fields @xmath3 ( rabi frequency @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( rabi frequency @xmath6 ) respectively . a weak , pulsed pump field @xmath7 ( rabi frequency @xmath8 ) and an external coherent driving field",

    "the choice of some parameters might be not very reasonably in our paper , however , via properly adjusting other physical variables , we believe that some experimental scientists have adequate wisdom to deal with this problem .    in the figure 2 , we plot the relative intensity of the generated fwm field @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54  for different eit windows . it can be easily seen from fig .",
    "2 that the relative intensities of the generated fwm field change dramatically for different eit windows .",
    "the reason for the above result can be qualitatively explained as follows .",
    "our atomic system is a kind of atomic configuration which owns the property of the double - dark resonances [ 21,22 ] . under this condition ,",
    "the coherent interaction for this atomic system can lead to the emergence of sharp spectral features of interacting double - dark resonances which strongly modify the optical properties of the double eit windows . therefore",
    ", it can be seen that the fwm generated waves are clearly different for different eit windows at that time .    in the following numerical calculations",
    ", we shows the effect of the intensity of the external coherent driving field on the fwm conversion efficiency @xmath55  in the figure 3 .",
    "we find that , when the intensity of the external coherent driving field is small , the fwm conversion efficiency is low .",
    "however , with the increasing the intensity of the external coherent driving field , the fwm conversion efficiency becomes very large .",
    "the maximum fwm efficiency is greater than 25% , which is orders of magnitude larger than previous schemes based on the two electromagnetically induced transparency . in order to test the validity of the analysis described above , we carry out extensive numerical calculations in the figure 4 .",
    "we give the three - dimensional plot of the dependence of the fwm conversion efficiency @xmath51 on the  two laser pump fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , the three - dimensional plot is also verified the above comments .    before ending this section",
    ", we would like to mention the two key points of the present study .",
    "one of the major differences between our scheme with those previous studies is that the maximum fwm efficiency ( nearly 30% ) is larger than previous schemes based on the two electromagnetically induced transparency , and the high efficiency four - wave mixing is induced by a easily controlled coherent driving field .",
    "the second point is that the effects of the intensity of the external coherent driving field on the fwm conversion efficiency @xmath51 is monotonically when the coherent driving field is stronge ( see figs . 3 - 4 ) .",
    "a reasonable explanation for this is that , with the presence of the external coherent driving field , we can obtain two quantum interference channels . with the increasing the intensity of the external coherent driving field ,",
    "the destructive and constructive interferences induced via the two quantum interference channels will keep a balance , so the intensity of the coherent driving field will influence the fwm conversion efficiency @xmath51 monotonically at that time .",
    "in fact , this is a consequence of the competition between the two quantum interference channels under relevant parametric conditions .",
    "to sum up , we have analyzed a five - level @xmath0-configuration four - wave mixing ( fwm ) scheme for obtaining a high - efficiency fwm based on the two electromagnetically induced transparency .",
    "we find that the maximum fwm efficiency is nearly 30% , which is orders of magnitude larger than previous schemes based on the two electromagnetically induced transparency .",
    "we hope that our results may be helpful for experimental studies .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
