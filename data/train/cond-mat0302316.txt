    "<S> recently , the superconductivity has been found in heavy electron compound pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 with the crystal structure of the filled skutterudite  @xcite . since the specific heat jump @xmath5 at the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6=1.8k is quite enhanced as @xmath7 mj / k@xmath8mole </S>",
    "<S> , heavy quasiparticles are responsible for the cooper pair formation . </S>",
    "<S> quite recently , a measurement of the longitudinal relaxation rate , @xmath9 , of nqr at sb site has been performed and very unusual temperature ( @xmath10 ) dependence was revealed both for @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite , while the normal state properties had been known to be also quite unconventional  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unconventional behaviors of @xmath9 are summarized as follows : 1 ) pseudo gap behavior is seen in @xmath13 at @xmath14 , in which the resistivity @xmath15 also shows a pseudo - gap behavior  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) there is no trace of the coherence ( hebel - slichter ) peak around @xmath16 at all . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) @xmath9 appears to exhibit an exponential @xmath10-dependence below @xmath17 , giving the superconducting gap @xmath18 in the low temperature limit as @xmath19 , although a possibility is not ruled out that the crossover to the @xmath20-dependence begins to be observed at around @xmath21 the lowest temperature covered by experiments .    very recently , the anomaly of specific heat near @xmath6 has been observed , which suggests a double transition at @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 )  @xcite it also turned out very recently on the basis of measurements of the angular dependence of the thermal conductivity @xmath25 under the magnetic field @xmath26 @xcite that there exsist at least two different superconducting phases in the @xmath10-@xmath26 phase diagram . in the low - field phase , the 2-fold component of @xmath27 along the @xmath28-direction is observed as a function of the angle of the direction of @xmath26 around the @xmath28-axis , while the 4-fold one is observed in the high - field phase . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundary approaches the lower critical temperature @xmath23 as @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in marked contrast with the case of a heavy electron superconductor cecoin@xmath30 where the data can be interpreted by a simple  d \"- wave model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors suggest that a novel type of heavy electron superconductivity is realized in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 .    the purpose of this letter is to present a scenario explaining such anomalous behaviors in a unified way on the basis of the crystalline - electric - field ( cef ) level , inferred from the experiment @xcite and theoretical study @xcite , a topology of the fermi surface ( fs ) offered from the band structure calculations @xcite , and a picture of the quasiparticles of @xmath31-based heavy electrons with a non - kramers ( non - magnetic ) doublet cef ground state .    the cef level scheme proposed by bauer _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the point group @xmath32 is as follows  @xcite : the lowest level is the non - kramers doublet @xmath33 ( @xmath34 in the representation of the point group @xmath35 ) @xmath36 and the first excited state is one of the triplet states @xmath37 or @xmath38 ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 for @xmath35 ) , wavefunction of which has the form @xmath41 where the coefficients @xmath42 s and @xmath43 s are not universal but depend on the details of the cef parameters  @xcite . the lowest excitation energy of cef levels has been estimated as @xmath44k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other excited cef levels have excitation energies higher than 100k so that their effects are negligible in the low temperature region of the order of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility of @xmath45-@xmath39 cef level scheme , with @xmath44k , can not be ruled out only from the analysis of the static susceptibility and the specific heat  @xcite the ultrasonic measurements performed quite recently strongly suggest that the @xmath46 is the cef gorund state  @xcite    around @xmath4710k , these lowest excited cef levels give considerable contribution not only to the thermodynamic quantities , such as the specific heat @xmath48 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath49 , but also to the nqr relaxation rate @xmath9 , since the  spin - flip \" process can occur among the states forming @xmath50 , e.g. , between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , giving the nqr relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that each cef level broadens due to the hybridization with the conduction electrons so that the energy conservation law is satisfied in the nqr or nmr relaxation process . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if we assume that the energy level of excited cef level is broadened such that its spectral weight is approximated by the lorentzian with the width @xmath53 , and that the processes across the cef ground states , ( [ gamma23 + ] ) and ( [ gamma23- ] ) , and @xmath39 s are neglected , the imaginary part of the spin - flip susceptibility @xmath54 is given simply , in the limit @xmath55 , as @xmath56 where const . </S>",
    "<S> is given by a combinatin of the coefficients @xmath57 s and @xmath58 s in ( [ gamma40 ] ) , and the clebsch - gordon coefficeints . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the nqr / nmr relaxation rate @xmath59 due to the excited cef level is given as @xmath60 the width of cef level arises from the hybridization between f- and conduction electrons and is of the order of the width of the renormalized quasiparticle band . </S>",
    "<S> in the present case , @xmath44k is comparable to the bandwidth of heavy electrons , so that @xmath53 is also expected to be highly renormalized by the correlation effect .    </S>",
    "<S> namely , if the temperature is decreased well below @xmath61=7k , the relaxation processes are gradually killed , leading to the pseudo - gap behavior ( [ rate ] ) at such temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> we have , however , the usual relaxation process due to the quasiparticles of the fermi liquid in addition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath10-dependence of @xmath62 at @xmath11 will be rather complicated one , since both contributions , from @xmath63 cef level ( @xmath64 ) and the quasiparticles ( @xmath65 ) , to @xmath9 are decreasing in such @xmath10-region with different @xmath10-dependence in general . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one has to be careful in drawing the structure of the superconducting gap from the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath9 at @xmath66 .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the nature of the gap structure specific to the present system . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it may be reasonable to assume that the strong on - site repulsion , the possible origin of the heavy electron state , can not be avoided in a manifold of the conventional s - wave pairing state . </S>",
    "<S> this is also consistent with the absence of the coherence peak in @xmath9  @xcite although the possibility of the strong coupling effect is not completely ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> another crucial aspect of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 uncovered by the band structure calculation is that the fs of the heavy electron band is missing in the directions of [ 1,0,0 ] and [ 1,1,1 ] and their equivalents as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ]  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there exists a small fs surrounding the @xmath67-point whose mass is not heavy  @xcite and has been detected by the de haas - van alphen experiment  @xcite . due to this porous structure of fs </S>",
    "<S> , even the anisotropic pairing state can have finite gap over the fs . </S>",
    "<S> however , even with such fs features being taken into account , the anisotropy of the gap due to such features of fs does not seem to fully explain the exponential - like @xmath10-dependence of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> +   + _ odd - parity pairing due to quadrupolar fluctuations _    </S>",
    "<S> we adopt here the odd - parity pairing to explain the unconventional nature of the superconducting state mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> there are at least three circumstantial evidences for favouring the odd - parity pairing . </S>",
    "<S> first , the pairing interaction should be mainly mediated by the mode which gives rise to mass enhancement of quasiparticles , the quadrupolar fluctuations in the present case . </S>",
    "<S> quadrupolar susceptibility @xmath68 is expected to be enhanced at large wave vector because the main fs has the nesting tendency as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] which can induce the attraction in both the  d\"- and  p \"- wave channel since the spin factor @xmath69 does not exist in contrast to the case of spin - fluctuation mechanism  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , a scenario for the bouble transition is more easily constructed in the odd - parity pairing with degeneracy due to the time - reversal symmetry than the even - parity pairings . </S>",
    "<S> third , the so - called maki parameter @xmath70 under the magnetic field exhibits no paramagnetic limitation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the pairing is also expected to be induced by exchanging the quadrupolar fluctuations of the non - kramers doublet @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupolar coupling between essentially localized 4f@xmath2-states and the quasiparticles containing considerable weight of the conduction electrons , arises through the hybridisation with the local symmetry of @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the cubic representaion of cef state of @xmath73-manifold , as discussed by cox in the context of the quadrupolar kondo effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the heavy quasiparticles contains the considerable weight of conduction electrons is a salient feature of f@xmath2-based heavy electron state , which is in marked contrast with the f@xmath74- or f@xmath75-based ones where the quasiparticles are dominated by f - electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it is also consistent with the result of band structure calculation which shows that the f - component of the heaviest band at fs is only several %  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator of the quadrupolar fluctuations @xmath76 may be given as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the propagator for local fluctuations of quadrupolar moment , and the polarisation function of quasiparticles , respectively , and @xmath80 is the coupling constant among them .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , the fs has a nesting tendency and @xmath79 is expected to have peaks at @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , and their equivalent positions . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the fs is rather flat in the @xmath28-direction near the nesting position as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> then , the pairing interaction in the static approximation , @xmath83 , can be parameterised as @xmath84 + \\gamma_{2}\\cos{q_{x}\\over 2}\\cos{q_{y}\\over 2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad + ( { \\hbox{cyclic permutations of $ q_{x}$ , $ q_{y}$ , and $ q_{z}$ } } ) , \\label{gamma1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 s are positive constants and @xmath86 is rather smaller than than @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the term of @xmath86 represents the effect that tendency of the nesting at @xmath82 is less than that at @xmath81 as seen in fig .  </S>",

[ fig:2 ] .    </S>",

    "<S> p \"- </S>",
    "<S> symmetry : @xmath99 , etc .. these gaps vanish along the direction of [ 1,1,1 ] or [ 1,0,0 ] , and its equivalent direction . </S>",
    "<S> however , since there exists no fs in those directions , @xmath9 exhibits an exponential @xmath10-dependence in the lowest temperature region in spite of the anisotropic gap . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the fermi surface of light electrons , detected by the de haas - van alphen experiment  @xcite , is closed surrounding the @xmath67-point and these gaps have nodes at points on this fs . </S>",
    "<S> however , since @xmath9 is proportional to the square of the density of states at the fermi level , the effect of such light electrons should hardly be seen by the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> other possible states in the odd - parity manifold are @xmath100 such states are less favourable compared to the chiral states ( [ triplet1 ] ) and ( [ triplet2 ] ) in the so - called weak - coupling case where the feedback effect is not taken into account . this can be seen from the structure of the gl free energy . </S>",

    "<S> \\label{gl4 } k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath104 due to the schwarz inequality , the gap ( [ triplet3 ] ) can not minimize @xmath105 in general . in case @xmath106 , </S>",
    "<S> the gap ( [ triplet1 ] ) minimizes @xmath105 , while the gap ( [ triplet2 ] ) minimizes @xmath105 in case @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> the low - field phase , in the @xmath10-@xmath26 phase diagram  @xcite , having 2-fold symmetry is consistent with the gap ( [ triplet3 ] ) , which can not be realized in the weak - coupling theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the case in the singlet manifold . </S>",

    "<S> , the expression , ( [ pi ] ) , would be reduced to @xmath114 then , the polarisation mediating the pairing interaction depends on the type of pairing itself . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the pairing ( [ triplet3 ] ) is expected to give larger ( [ pi2 ] ) than the pairing ( [ triplet2 ] ) , because the gap function of ( [ triplet3 ] ) @xmath115 vanishes on the planes , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , which pass through near the fs , while the gap function ( [ triplet2 ] ) @xmath118 \\label{pi4}\\ ] ] vanishes only on the lines , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , etc . </S>",

    "<S> we have included in ( [ boundary ] ) the so - called the demagnetisation factor @xmath171 which depends on the sample shape . in ( [ boundary ] ) , the energy due to the magnetic field arising from the intrinsic magnetisation itself is neglected because it is much smaller than the external field @xmath172 in question . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field giving the phase boundary beween low- and high - field phases , determined by the thermal conductivity , roughly agrees with the present estimation is in the same order as given by ( [ boundary ] ) , because @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 . </S>",

    "<S> if a type of the state ( [ triplet2 ] ) is realized in the high - field phase , the free energy takes minimum when the quantisation axis of intrinsic angular momentum is parallel to @xmath178 for which @xmath27 is minimum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when the direction of @xmath178 is rotated by angle @xmath181 from the @xmath182-axis in the plane perpendicular to @xmath28-axis , @xmath27 increases and reaches maximum at @xmath183 above which the stable quantisation axis changes from @xmath182- to @xmath184-axis , and then @xmath27 decreases up to @xmath185 where the stable configuration is reached again . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the 2-fold dependence of @xmath186 taking maximum at @xmath187 can be possible in the low - field phase , and the 4-fold one taking minimum at @xmath187 and @xmath185 in the high - field phase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion , it is remarked that the magnetic susceptibility , both longitudinal and transverse , can be enhanced by electron correlations even if the mass enhancement arises from the degeneracy due to the non - kramers doublet , i.e. , electric quadrupolar moment , provided that there exists a perturbation which breaks the particle - hole symmetry , such as the repulsion among conduction electrons , as shown by the numerical renormalization group calculations for the impurity model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in marked contrast with the case of heavy electrons based on f@xmath2-configuration with the singlet cef ground state  @xcite , where the static susceptibility along the easy axis due to quasiparticles is not enhanced while the nmr / nqr relaxation rates given by the dynamical transverse susceptibility is enhanced in proportion to a square of the mass - enhancement factor as observed in upt@xmath188  @xcite . </S>",
