    "power meters used ( agilent n1911a ) had some operating modes , e.g.  averaging mode and peak mode .",
    "since our simulation results showed the same peaks for different pulse widths in time domain , we adopted the averaging mode .",
    "however , this indicates that depending on the duty cycle of the pulse , we needed to offset the received signals , e.g.  if the received signal is 10 dbm and the duty cycle is 10 % ( i.e.  -10 db ) , then the actual magnitude is 20 dbm ( i.e.  10 dbm - ( -10 db ) ) . due to the noise floor of the power meters , the duty cycle could not be set too small , otherwise the measured value would read the noise floor .",
