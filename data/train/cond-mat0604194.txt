    "quasi - one - dimensional quantum spin systems exhibit several interesting field - induced phenomena . in a gapped spin chain",
    "an external magnetic field exhibits a quantum phase transition to the gapless tomonaga - luttinger liquid phase at some critical field @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the tomonaga - luttinger liquid phase basically continues up to the saturation field @xmath4 and is characterized by the power - law decay of the spin correlation function : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetization along the field @xmath7 , and the fermi wave number @xmath8 depends on the magnetization . since these exponents satisfy @xmath9 in usual antiferromagnets , the commensurate antiferromagnetic long - range order perpendicular to @xmath1 should appear in the presence of interchain interactions .",
    "in fact , such a field - induced antiferromagnetic order has been theoretically proposed  @xcite and experimentally observed in some quasi - one - dimensional gapped systems  @xcite . here",
    "it should be noted that the ordered phase can be also interpreted as a result of the magnon bose - einstein condensation  @xcite .    in some one - dimensional ( 1d ) frustrated systems ,",
    "however , the @xmath10-inversion , namely @xmath11 , has been predicted for some intermediate strength of the magnetic field between @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "indeed , such @xmath10-inversion has been suggested experimentally by the nmr relaxation rate @xmath12 of an organic @xmath13 bond - alternating chain , pentafulorophenyl nitronyl nitroxide ( f@xmath0pnn ) , in a certain temperature region where a power - law behaviour of @xmath12 can be observed  @xcite .",
    "a more interesting point associated with the @xmath10-inversion is that the field - induced long - range _ incommensurate order _ can appear , reflecting the enhancement of the incommensurate correlation  @xcite .",
    "although the recent specific heat measurement  @xcite indicates that the field - induced commensurate antiferromagnetic order may be realized for f@xmath0pnn , the nmr experiments are still suggesting that an enhancement of the incommensurate correlation in f@xmath0pnn .",
    "thus , it seems that f@xmath0pnn is located in the vicinity of the boundary between the commensurate order phase and the incommensurate order phase . in this paper , we discuss the possibility of realizing the field - induced incommensurate order in f@xmath0pnn , putting a special emphasize on a high - pressure effect which can enhance the frustrating interaction .",
    "we examine how the incommensurate order appears in the phase diagram on the basis of density matrix renormalization group calculations of a microscopic model for f@xmath0pnn .",
    "we also mention a possibility for a magnetization plateau and coexistence of the commensurate and incommensurate orders .",
    "the experimentally observed @xmath10-inversion and the field - dependent crossover of the bond - alternating ratio  @xcite have indicated the presence of frustration in f@xmath0pnn .",
    "thus , we consider the bond - alternating spin chain with the next - nearest - neighbour interaction in a magnetic field @xmath14 as a realistic model for f@xmath0pnn , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) denote the alternating nearest neighbour interactions , and @xmath18 means the next - nearest neighbour coupling . in",
    "what follows , @xmath15 is set to unity for simplicity . for @xmath19 , the model is basically in the tomonaga - luttinger liquid phase with the fermi wave number @xmath20 .",
    "let us briefly explain the mechanism of the field - induced incommensurate order .",
    "if @xmath18 is sufficiently large , the @xmath10-inversion occurs around @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the saturated magnetization  @xcite . at the magnetic field in the @xmath10-inversion region",
    ", the dominant spin correlation should not be the usual commensurate antiferromagnetic one perpendicular to @xmath1 , but the incommensurate one along the @xmath1-direction . in the presence of interchain interactions ,",
    "the long - range order corresponding to the dominant spin correlation is expected , implying that a long - range incommensurate order in the @xmath1 direction can be realized for the region @xmath11 .    in the present study ,",
    "the dominant spin correlation is determined by two staggered susceptibilities @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponding to the spin correlations ( [ sx ] ) and ( [ sz ] ) , respectively .",
    "low temperature behaviours of the susceptibilities are characterized by the exponents @xmath25 and @xmath26  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are nonuniversal coefficients .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : diverge ] ) shows that the more dominant spin correlation corresponds to the more strongly divergent susceptibility .",
    "when the @xmath10-inversion occurs , for example , @xmath24 shows stronger divergence than @xmath23 .    for quantitative treatment of the field - induced order and of the accompanied phase transition",
    ", we use the above susceptibilities .",
    "based on the mean - field approximation for the interchain interaction @xmath30  @xcite , the critical temperature @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is @xmath34 or @xmath35 , and @xmath36 the number of adjacent chains .    on the basis of equations  ( [ eq :",
    "diverge ] ) and ( [ eq : tc ] ) , we can classify possible types of the field - induced orders ; we consider the following cases , which are depicted in figure  1 .",
    "the first one is that @xmath37 [ figure  [ fig : kai ] ( a ) ]  @xcite . in this case , since @xmath23 strongly diverges , @xmath38 is always realized . as @xmath2 decreases , @xmath23 first satisfies the relation  ( [ eq : tc ] ) and the commensurate order appears below @xmath31 . by contrast , if the @xmath10-inversion occurs ( i.e. @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 is naively expected .",
    "however , we should pay attention to the magnitude of the non - universal coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we have found that , even for @xmath39 , @xmath28 is larger than @xmath29 , and thus @xmath23 can be larger than @xmath24 at high temperatures , although @xmath24 finally exceeds @xmath23 at @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 , therefore , @xmath23 satisfies equation  ( [ eq : tc ] ) at a higher temperature and the commensurate order appears [ see figure  [ fig : kai ] ( b ) ] . in such a case",
    ", another phase transition is expected to occur from the commensurate phase to the incommensurate phase at @xmath41 .",
    "the previous dmrg analysis of the free energy has illustrated that the transition actually occurs when @xmath43 is not so large  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath44 [ figure  [ fig : kai ] ( c ) ] , @xmath24 satisfies equation  ( [ eq : tc ] ) first and only the incommensurate order appears .     and",
    "@xmath24 in three cases . at @xmath45 ,",
    "the larger susceptibility satisfies the relation  ( [ eq : tc ] ) . at @xmath41 in ( b ) and ( c ) ,",
    "@xmath23 is equal to @xmath24 . ]",
    "by a numerical calculation of @xmath23 and @xmath24 for a single chain and the mean - field treatment described above , we have obtained @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagrams . for the calculation at finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit , we use the finite temperature dmrg  @xcite .",
    "the dmrg calculation has been carried out with the maximum number of the retained bases @xmath46 and the truncation error is at most the order of @xmath47 .",
    "technical details to obtain @xmath23 and @xmath24 are described in reference  @xcite .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the phase diagrams for typical three parameters of the frustrating coupling : ( a ) @xmath48 ( small @xmath18 case ) , ( b ) @xmath49 ( intermediate @xmath18 case ) , and ( c ) @xmath50 ( large @xmath18 case ) .",
    "the interchain interaction is fixed to @xmath51 , and @xmath16 is fixed to a realistic value 0.45 for f@xmath0pnn  @xcite . in the figure , c and",
    "ic denote the commensurate antiferromagnetic - order phase and the incommensurate one , respectively .",
    "the phase diagram in the case ( a ) is typical for spin - gapped quasi-1d spin systems , where it should be remarked that the shape of the phase boundary between the c phase and the disordered phase looks like a semicircle .",
    "since @xmath23 is always larger than @xmath24 as shown in figure  [ fig : kai ] ( a ) , the ic phase never appears .      in the case ( b ) , the phase diagram is clearly different from the case ( a ) in the following two points .",
    "the first one is the appearance of the ic phase in a very low temperature region . at @xmath52 , where the magnetization @xmath6 at @xmath53 is equal to @xmath54 ,",
    "the @xmath10-inversion occurs and thus @xmath24 shows slightly stronger divergence than that of @xmath23 . thus the ic phase can appear around @xmath52 in the quite low temperature region ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "however , in the high temperature region ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath23 is larger than @xmath24 , resulting in the transition between the commensurate order phase and the disordered phase at @xmath57 .",
    "these behaviours of the staggered susceptibilities correspond to figure  [ fig : kai ] ( b ) .",
    "another important point is that the phase boundary between the c phase and the disordered phase is deformed from the semicircle - shape particularly around @xmath52 .",
    "this is because the transverse fluctuation is suppressed by the frustration effect even in @xmath56 , resulting in the lowering of @xmath31 .      in the case ( c ) ,",
    "the large @xmath18 enhances the incommensurate correlation and extends the region of the ic phase . around @xmath58",
    ", @xmath23 behaves as in figure  [ fig : kai ] ( c ) and thus we can observe the direct transition from the disordered phase to the ic phase , which divides the c phase into the low-@xmath1 part and the high-@xmath1 part .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in the previous work  @xcite , the authors estimated @xmath18 of f@xmath0pnn as @xmath59(= 0.3k ) , based on a qualitative analysis of the magnetization curve .",
    "this value is slightly smaller than the critical value ( @xmath60 ) for the @xmath10-inversion or the emergence of the incommensurate order ( see figure  [ fig : ic ] ) .",
    "we however think that high - pressure experiments can realize the incommensurate phase within realistic experimental situations .",
    "for example , a hydrostatic pressure experiment reveals a drastic change of the bond - alternation ratio in powder samples of f@xmath0pnn  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a recent experiment clarifies that specific heat of the power samples has slightly different temperature dependence from that of a single crystal of f@xmath0pnn , which can be attributed to an effective pressure caused by an experimentally technical reason  @xcite .",
    "these experimental results strongly indicate that the properties of f@xmath0pnn are quite sensitive to the pressure .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to discuss precisely how the incommensurate order phase develops in the @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagram near the phase boundary of the @xmath10-inversion .",
    "-@xmath18 phase diagram of the dominant correlations at @xmath61 at zero temperature , which is equivalent to the 1/2 plateau phase diagram in reference  @xcite .",
    "the filled circle corresponds to the parameters of f@xmath0pnn . ]    as in figure  [ fig : ic ] , we can readily consider possible two paths such that the couplings of f@xmath0pnn exceeds the critical value for the incommensurate order : increasing the next - nearest neighbour interaction @xmath18 ( arrow @xmath62 ) and/or decreasing the alternating coupling @xmath16 ( arrow @xmath63 ) . here , we chiefly discuss the @xmath18-dependence of the @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagrams along the vertical arrow direction in figure  [ fig : ic ] , assuming that @xmath30 is independent of the pressure .",
    "we can then expect that the features of @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagrams should change as figure  [ fig1 ] ( a ) @xmath64 figure  [ fig1 ] ( b ) @xmath64 figure  [ fig1 ] ( c ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is sufficiently enhanced by the pressure , the direct phase transition from the disordered phase to the ic phase would be observed in a middle range of the magnetic field as in the case ( c ) .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , however , a notable point is that , even in the case ( b ) , we may find the deformation of the phase boundary between the disordered phase and the c phase . from the experimental view",
    ", such a deformation of the phase boundary can be an important signal of a development of the ic order induced by the frustration , though it may be difficult to capture the ic phase at a very low temperature .",
    "next , we discuss how the changes of the exchange interactions can reflect on a measurement of the specific heat at _ the zero magnetic field _ , which is quite helpful in analysis of the experimental results , because it is not an easy work to obtain a complete @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagram in actual experiments  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : capa ] shows temperature dependence of the specific heat for various values of @xmath18 and @xmath16 along the arrows in figure  [ fig : ic ] . when the frustrating interaction @xmath18 increases along the @xmath62 direction , it is found that the pronounced peak around @xmath65 sharpens .",
    "we note that this can be attributed to the increase of the density of state caused by the narrowing of the @xmath66 magnon band width  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "such a band narrowing also occurs , as @xmath16 is reduced along the @xmath63 direction .",
    "we can then see that the peak sharpens as well .",
    "we therefore think that a careful analysis of the shape of the specific heat peak at @xmath67 provides an important information for the enhancement of the ic correlation in the intermediate magnetic field region , although the pressure effect subtly influences the both of @xmath18 and @xmath16 in the actual situation .     and",
    "@xmath63 in figure  [ fig : ic ] . , title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath63 in figure  [ fig : ic ] . , title=\"fig : \" ]    here , we should make a comment on the pressure effect for the _ interchain _ interaction .",
    "if @xmath30 is also enhanced by the pressure , the direct phase transition from the disordered phase to the ic phase may be suppressed within the interchain mean - field analysis as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , where the interchain interaction is assumed to be unfrustrating .",
    "nevertheless , the precise analysis of the crystal structure  @xcite of f@xmath0pnn has indicated that the interchain couplings are also frustrating , which would effectively decrease value of @xmath30 in the mean - field approximation . in order to reveal the role of the frustrating interchain interaction , of course , a precise analysis beyond the mean - field level",
    "is clearly required .",
    "-@xmath2 phase diagram in case of large @xmath18 and large @xmath30 ( @xmath50 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "]    finally , we want to discuss a magnetization plateau at the half of the full - moment . as in figure",
    "[ fig : ic ] , the 1/2 plateau is closely related to the mechanism of the @xmath10-inversion ; the criterion for the @xmath10-inversion is equivalent to the one for the plateau formation  @xcite .",
    "the level spectroscopy analysis  @xcite on the model ( [ ham ] ) has indicated the 1/2 plateau should appear at half the saturated magnetization for @xmath69 and @xmath50 . however , we think that it may be difficult to observed the clear evidence of the 1/2 plateau of f@xmath0pnn even with a high pressure experiment .",
    "this is because the width of the plateau is still very narrow for these couplings , and thus the thermal fluctuation smears out the plateau even at temperatures where we can observe the magnetization . in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the magnetization curves for @xmath69 and @xmath50 obtained by the finite temperature dmrg , illustrating that the plateau is easily smeared out by the thermal effect .",
    "we think that , as for f@xmath0pnn , it is rather hopeful to verify the presence of the ic order than to make a direct observation of the 1/2 plateau .",
    "and @xmath50 at several temperatures . ]",
    "to summarize , we have discussed field - induced ic order for the bond - alternating spin chain with the next - nearest interaction , which is relevant to the high pressure experiments of f@xmath0pnn . in particular , we have analyzed how the various physical quantities behaves near the phase boundary , and then concluded that the precise analysis for the phase boundary and the zero - field specific heat can detect a signal of the field - induced ic order . further experimental studies on f@xmath0pnn are quite interesting .",
    "in addition , it is also a challenging issue to search another spin chains exhibiting the field - induced incommensurate order .",
    "a recently observed new phase of ndmap in the magnetic field might be a possible candidate  @xcite .    the field - induced commensurate order in a quantum spin system is often described as the bose einstein condensation ( bec ) of a magnon gas .",
    "the present ic order may be viewed as a result of a `` charge order '' of the magnon .",
    "as mentioned in reference  @xcite the transition between the field - induced incommensurate order and the usual commensurate antiferromagnetic one is of the first order",
    ". then we can expect the coexistence of the two orders at the phase boundary .",
    "recently , such a coexistence of the two different orders is actually observed in solid @xmath70he , which is called `` super - solid '' state  @xcite .",
    "a connection to such an exotic state is also an interesting problem both from experimental and theoretical viewpoints .",
