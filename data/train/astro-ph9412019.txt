    "both the dumand and amanda groups acknowledge that detectors with effective areas on the order of @xmath1 m@xmath2 provide marginal capability for detecting neutrino sources given present theoretical estimates as well as data on gamma rays .",
    "the aim of the present generation of detectors , including baikal and nestor , is to demonstrate the value of neutrino astronomy by providing the first look at the neutrino sky .",
    "definitive results will be likely to come from the next generation of neutrino detectors , which must have sensitive volumes on the order of a cubic kilometer . given the history of dumand , with a delay of nearly 30 years between the first discussions of the detector concept and its materialization in hardware , everyone with an interest in neutrino astronomy is concerned about reducing the lead time for the next step . in part , during the early years dumand was a concept waiting for the development of appropriate technology ( _ eg _ , wet - mateable fiber optics connectors , which became available in the late 80s ) , but it is certainly not too early to begin design and organizational activities on the second generation now .",
    "it seems clear that both the deep - sea and polar - ice approaches have valuable features as well as problems that are not yet resolved , at least to the satisfaction of the community at large . at present",
    "it is still possible that amanda will find no end to its bubble problem at practical depths .",
    "similarly , although the basic feasibility and technological issues are resolved , it is essential for dumand to definitively demonstrate its ability to overcome component reliability problems and operate a complex detector system deep underwater on a long - term basis .",
    "if either group fails to achieve these goals , the direction for future work will be clear ; in the happy circumstance that both detectors work as planned , a decision about whether the km@xmath0 detector should be underwater or in the ice will be based on assessment of results from initial runs .",
    "several significant initiatives took place in early 1994 : a workshop held at the jet propulsion laboratory led to the formation of a us - based coalition to pursue a cubic kilometer detector , and later the european community s megascience workshop resulted in a similar european coalition . at the 1994 snowmass summer study ( entitled  particle and nuclear astrophysics and cosmology in the next millenium \" ) an interest group combining both coalitions was organized .",
    "the existing band groups ( baikal , amanda , nestor , dumand ) are working with the jpl group and others to organize workshops aimed at preparing a conceptual proposal before the end of 1995 , so that funding initiatives can begin promptly . already , jpl workers have begun development of new om designs which have extremely low power consumption and use optical fibers for power as well as data transmission .",
    "interested individuals should join the group to keep apprised of progress ; consult the worldwide web for further details :    ....",
    "special thanks are due to steve barwick , francis halzen , john learned , and robert morse for help in assembling the information needed for this review .",
    "however , blame for mistakes and invalid opinions expressed lies with me alone .",

    "<S> results were mixed , with both projects making substantial progress , but encountering setbacks that delayed full - scale operation . </S>",
    "<S> the achievements , status , and plans ( as of 10/94 ) of these two projects will be discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     while both dumand and amanda are pursuing the cerenkov light technique , earlier investigations have suggested that a very large volume detector of high energy neutrinos can be constructed at very low cost using acoustical detection . </S>",
    "<S> the deposition of energy in the water by produced particles generates a low level characteristic bipolar sound pulse with an effective frequency spectrum peaked in the range 30 to 60 khz . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrophone array built into dumand for its positioning system is very efficient in this range , and should be capable of detecting particle cascades of about 1 pev at a range of 40m@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simulation studies suggest that by using noise cancellation and signal coherence techniques ( ie , treating our set of hydrophones as a phased array ) , it will be possible to systematically enhance noise rejection and detect high energy particles . </S>",
    "<S> the dumand array will be equipped to observe coincidences of om and acoustical signals and this will provide the first direct practical test of acoustical detection . </S>",
    "<S> dumand will also supply acoustical equipment to amanda for tests of acoustical detection in the ice .    throughout the process of detector construction and deployment , </S>",
    "<S> the two groups have engaged in mutual assistance and cooperation despite the inevitable sense of competition . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite likely that at some point in the future we will be working together directly to focus resources and expand capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the present dumand and amanda arrays , even after all currently planned deployments are completed , will serve primarily as test beds and prototypes for a much larger detector . </S>"
