    "gravitational radiation offers an exciting possibility to set an upper limit on the spin frequencies of accretionally spun - up neutron stars in close binaries @xcite . the source for",
    "gravitational radiation may be the mass quadrupole supported by static stresses within the neutron star crust ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or the current quadrupole from an @xmath2 r - mode which is driven by gravitational radiation reaction ( @xcite , @xcite ; for a review of the r - mode instability see , e.g. , @xcite ; for the discovery paper see @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the second option , namely that accretional spin - up triggers the r - mode instability , and the resulting spin - down torque from gravitational radiation reaction balances or exceeds the accretion torque .",
    "the instability is triggered when the r - mode growth rate due to gravitational radiation reaction ( which is a sharply increasing function of the stellar spin frequency ) becomes equal to the r - mode viscous damping rate .",
    "the viscous damping timescale for r - modes was first computed by @xcite .",
    "they assumed that a neutron star is a fluid ball with a polytropic equation of state , and that the viscosity is set by neutron - neutron scattering in the nuclear matter .",
    "their viscous damping implied that , if the neutron star core temperature @xmath3  k , which is the case for the rapidly accreting neutron stars in lmxbs @xcite , then the r - mode instability would be triggered at a stellar spin frequency just above @xmath4  hz .",
    "this is inconsistent with observations : most neutron stars in lmxbs are believed to be spinning with frequencies around @xmath5  hz ( see @xcite for a review ) , and the existence of two 1.6  ms radio pulsars means that rapidly rotating neutron stars are somehow formed in spite of the r - mode instability @xcite .",
    "the r - mode damping rate would have to be @xmath6 higher than that computed by @xcite to allow for such high spins .",
    "@xcite conjectured that , for the range of temperatures relevant for lmxbs , mutual friction between the neutron and proton superfluids will provide the missing damping .",
    "however , tour - de - force calculations of @xcite showed that , except for @xmath7% of the allowed parameter space , mutual friction gives only a modest increase of the r - mode damping rate , insufficient to account for the observed high spins of neutron stars .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter bu ) argued that the crust plays an important role in r - mode damping . in their picture , the r - mode lives in the liquid core , and most of the dissipation occurs in a thin ( a few cm ) viscous boundary layer between the oscillating core and the motionless ( in the rotating frame ) solid crust .",
    "the damping bu computed is a factor of @xmath8 higher than that of @xcite ; it implies that the r - modes would not become unstable unless the spin frequency is close to break - up , which is significantly higher than the observed lmxb spins . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have revised the bu estimate , down and up respectively , by factors of order unity .",
    "both of these corrections are valid ; the net result is that the bu estimate is almost unchanged .",
    "however , there is still a substantial correction unaccounted for in the previous work . in this paper",
    ", we show that , for a considerable fraction of the parameter space , the boundary layer damping rate is a factor of @xmath1 smaller than the bu estimate , and hence the critical frequencies for the onset of the r - mode instability are correspondingly lower , @xmath9  hz .    bu considered only the leading - order transverse motion pattern of the r - modes and assumed that these motions do not penetrate into the crust .",
    "they estimated the magnitude of the viscous coupling between these transverse motions and the crust , and found it to be small . therefore , their picture is that of a liquid in a bucket  the amplitude of the relative motion ( slippage ) between the crust and the core is just equal to the amplitude of the fluid motion at the boundary .",
    "however , small radial motions of the r - mode , neglected by bu , are very effective at coupling the crust and the core . above a small critical frequency ,",
    "r - modes do _ strongly _ penetrate into the crust , and the crust and the core oscillate almost in unison with very similar amplitudes .",
    "the slippage @xmath10 in this regime is only a small fraction of the total r - mode motion , @xmath11 , with typical values of @xmath12 , which results in a correction of a factor of @xmath13 to the bu viscous boundary layer damping rate .",
    "the fact that the crust is not rigid is central to our story .",
    "in fact , the crust is more like a gel : the shear modulus is much smaller than the bulk modulus . the @xmath2 torsional mode in a non - rotating crust , which has",
    "the same angular displacement pattern as the corresponding r - mode , has a frequency @xmath14  hz @xcite .",
    "this frequency is a few times lower than the r - mode frequency in rapidly rotating stars , indicating that the elastic restoring force is quite weak compared to the coriolis force which is responsible for the r - mode oscillations .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high spin frequencies , one would expect the crust to oscillate more or less like a liquid , with elasticity only slightly modifying the mode structure . indeed ,",
    "if the shear modulus @xmath15 of the crust were exactly zero , i.e. , if the crust were completely fluid , there would be no slippage @xmath10 between the crust and the core . since @xmath15 is non - zero but small",
    ", one would expect the slippage to be proportional to the ratio of the elastic restoring force to the coriolis force , i.e. , roughly @xmath16 .",
    "however , our numerical work shows that the slippage is not a monotonically decreasing function of the spin frequency ; it rises sharply at the frequencies of avoided crossings between the r - mode and the higher - order torsional modes of the crust .",
    "figure  [ fig : dispersion ] shows the slippage as a function of the spin frequency computed for two neutron star models with different crust thicknesses ( 10% and 20% of the stellar radius ) .",
    "we begin in ",
    "[ sec : equations ] by outlining the equations governing the pulsations of constant density stars with fluid cores and solid crusts and presenting the numerical results for the dependence of the slippage @xmath17 on the spin frequency . in ",
    "[ sec : stability - curves ] we use the computed slippages to construct the critical r - mode stability curves ; see figure  [ fig : instab ] .",
    "the resulting curves are quite sensitive to the thickness of the neutron star crust . in particular , for a sufficiently thick crust , the stability curve has a peculiar multi - valued structure , which is a consequence of the non - monotonic dependence of the relative slippage on the spin frequency .",
    "the stability curve determines the maximum spin of a neutron star as a function of temperature ; we find that it generally goes through the region of observed spin frequencies of neutron stars in lmxbs and in millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "broad implications of our results are discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "oscillation modes of a rotating neutron star with an elastic crust were analyzed by @xcite ( hereafter ls ) .",
    "their analysis was performed for the case of slow rotation , which was treated as a perturbation to other restoring forces , and the oblateness of the equilibrium configuration was neglected .",
    "we broadly utilize their general formalism , however we derive equations specialized to the constant - density case . for r - modes the correction to the eigenfrequency due to the non - sphericity of the equilibrium configuration is of the same order as the correction due to the radial motion @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that the oblateness of the star will not change the _ qualitative _ picture for the crust - core slippage : at high enough spin frequencies , the core and the crust will move almost in unison .",
    "the _ quantitative _ effects of non - sphericity are not treated in this paper .    for our toy model , we assume that the outer part , @xmath18 , of the neutron star of radius @xmath19 possesses a small shear modulus @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 . the neutron star fluid is assumed to be incompressible , has a constant density @xmath22 , and is rotating with angular frequency @xmath23 .",
    "the general displacement @xmath24 of a fluid element , in a frame rotating with the neutron star , is given by ( @xcite , ls ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mode frequency in the rotating frame , @xmath27 is the fixed azimuthal number , and @xmath28 is the gradient of the spherical harmonic evaluated on a unit sphere .",
    "we are interested in the @xmath29 r - mode . for a purely fluid star , to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the keplerian angular velocity , the displacement for this mode is given by @xmath32 i.e. , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are of order @xmath35 . in the solid crust ,",
    "the displacement vector need not satisfy the ordering assumed in eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) .",
    "however , at least for modes with @xmath26 close to @xmath36 , the coriolis force is the dominant restoring force , and we expect @xmath33 and @xmath34 to be small ; this ordering is confirmed by our numerical results ( see   [ sec : stability - curves ] ) .",
    "we now define dimensionless frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as well as the dependent variables similar to those utilized by ls :    [ eq : var - definitions ] @xmath39    in the constant density case , @xmath40 is not a dynamical variable , as it can be eliminated using the continuity equation , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 however , even in the @xmath43 case , the eulerian pressure perturbation is non - zero , and , to leading order , is given by @xmath44 .",
    "we define the dimensionless pressure perturbation , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the local gravitational acceleration .",
    "finally , we define the dimensionless shear modulus , @xmath47 . throughout this paper , we use @xmath48 , chosen so that the the frequency of the @xmath2 fundamental torsional crustal mode is close to the @xmath0  hz value computed by @xcite for a non - rotating neutron star ; the shear wave speed corresponding to this choice is @xmath49  cm  s@xmath50 .",

    "the keplerian spin frequency @xmath63 , the shear modulus @xmath15 , and the ratio of the crust thickness to the stellar radius @xmath64 are the only parameters necessary to describe a constant density star ( we neglect the thin surface ocean and the modes that are present in it , as they are unlikely to influence the crust - core slippage ) .",
    "the crust thickness is roughly proportional to the scale height at the crust - core boundary , and is hence @xmath65 . in order to survey the range of parameters ,",
    "we carry out our calculations for two models , a `` thin '' crust model with @xmath66 , and a `` thick '' crust model with @xmath67 . because of the differences in the normal mode spectrum between these two cases",
    ", we shall see that the r - mode instability curves for the two models have qualitatively different behavior in the temperature range of interest for accreting neutron stars , @xmath68  k.    the left panel of figure  [ fig : dispersion ] displays the results of our calculations for @xmath2 for the thin crust model , while the right panel shows the results for the thick crust model .",
    "let us first concentrate on the top plots , which show the dispersion relation , @xmath69 , for the two models .",
    "contrary to the case of a purely fluid star , where , in the isentropic case , there is only one `` classical '' @xmath29 r - mode , all the modes displayed in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] have displacements of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) , with @xmath70 _ in the core_. however , only the mode with @xmath26 closest to the `` classical '' r - mode value , @xmath36 , is of interest to us .",
    "this mode is denoted by thick dots in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] . when @xmath26 is much different from @xmath36 , the displacements in the crust are much bigger than the displacements in the core , resulting in large slippage , and , hence , large damping .",
    "in essence , unless the mode frequency is close to the r - mode value , the elasticity of the crust plays the dominant role in determining the mode properties , and the mode is a crustal mode , rather than a core r - mode .",
    "consider the low spin frequency ( @xmath71 ) limit of our results . in this case , the mode with the lowest frequency in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] is the `` classical '' @xmath29 r - mode , which has the transverse displacement @xmath72 in the core and negligible displacements in the crust .",
    "this behavior ( liquid in a bucket ) is the approximation used by bu .",
    "the modes at higher frequencies are torsional crustal oscillations , which have appreciable displacements in the crust , and negligible displacements in the core .",
    "the fundamental ( nodeless ) torsional mode has @xmath73 for both models .",
    "the lack of sensitivity of the frequency of this mode to the thickness of the crust was first noted by @xcite .",
    "the modes at higher frequencies are overtones , and we note that the mode spectrum for the thick crust model is denser than that of the thin crust model .",
    "qualitatively , the mode frequency is determined by fitting a certain number of nodes of the eigenfunction between the boundaries of the crust , and hence a thicker crust supports more modes .",
    "as the spin frequency is increased beyond @xmath74 , the behavior of the modes changes .",
    "the frequency of the core r - modes rises to meet with the frequencies of the modes which originally resided in the crust , resulting in avoided crossings . at",
    "the first avoided crossing , the core r - mode is coupled with the lowest - order torsional mode of the crust ; at this avoided crossing the core r - mode strongly penetrates the crust .",
    "as the spin frequency increases beyond the first crossing , the crust - core slippage decreases along the branch closest to the `` classical '' r - mode frequency , @xmath75 ( marked by a dashed line in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] ) .",
    "since the boundary layer damping rate is proportional to @xmath13 , this branch is most interesting for us as it corresponds to the r - mode with the lowest damping , and , hence , the most unstable .    the relative slippage as a function of the spin frequency is plotted in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "we always plot slippage of the r - mode from the branch with the lowest damping , marked by thick dots in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] ( i.e. , the most unstable r - mode ) . as the spin frequency increases beyond the first crossing , the slippage decreases to @xmath76 .",
    "however , the thick crust model has another avoided crossing at @xmath77 , and the slippage rises at this frequency because the core r - mode couples resonantly with a higher - order torsional crustal mode . in the thick crust model , the `` valley '' in which the second mode dominates only extends to @xmath78 .",
    "after the avoided crossing , the third mode has the smallest slip , @xmath79 .",
    "note that the slip value is @xmath80 near the avoided crossing and is @xmath81 for @xmath82 , or for spin frequencies between @xmath83 and @xmath84  hz . in this regime ,",
    "the viscous boundary layer damping rate approaches the high bu value , and so the critical spin frequency for the r - mode instability is high as well .",
    "as we now show , the shape of the r - mode stability curve depends quite sensitively on the thickness of the crust .",
    "the dissipation rate in the viscous boundary layer is set by the amplitude of the relative motion between the core and the crust .",
    "bu assumed that the crust remains static in the rotating frame , and hence the amount of boundary slippage @xmath85 .",
    "however , as shown in the previous section , the slippage @xmath17 is generally significantly less than @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the bu estimate of the damping rate has to be multiplied by @xmath13 .",
    "the corrected r - mode damping rate is [ cf .",

    "we also neglected the contribution of the elastic energy of the crust to the total mode energy , as well as the small deviation of the mode frequency from @xmath75 .",
    "the r - mode growth rate due to gravitational radiation is given by @xmath98 note that this expression is different from the one used by bu .",
    "@xcite pointed out that bu incorrectly rescaled @xmath99 used by @xcite to the canonical @xmath100  km .",
    "@xcite gave their own estimate of the r - mode growth rate for a constant density star .",
    "( [ growth ] ) is the correct @xmath99 for an @xmath101 polytrope , neglecting the deviation of the transverse displacement from @xmath102 in the crust , as well as the small deviation of the mode frequency from @xmath75 .    while we computed the slippage using a constant density model",
    ", we utilize @xmath103 ( eq .  [ [ damping ] ] ) and @xmath99 ( eq .  [ [ growth ] ] ) appropriate for a more realistic @xmath101 polytrope .",
    "compared to more realistic models , using @xmath99 and @xmath104 for a constant density model overestimates the gravitational radiation growth rate ( by putting more mass at larger radii ) , and underestimates the strength of the boundary layer damping ( by virtue of a larger mode energy ) .",
    "both of these effects result in lower critical frequencies for the onset of the r - mode instability .",
    "slippage calculations for more realistic models are in progress .",
    "the stability curve is obtained by equating the gravitational - radiation - induced growth rate with the viscous dissipation rate .",
    "since we are primarily interested in temperatures below the melting temperature of the crust , @xmath105  k , we neglect the dissipation due to bulk viscosity .",
    "we also ignore the dissipation due to the shear in the interior of the star , as well as any potentially important dissipation mechanisms that may be operating in the crust , and presume that the viscous boundary layer is the dominant energy sink . since we do not have an analytical expression for the slippage , it is more convenient to evaluate the critical temperature , @xmath91 , such that @xmath106 : @xmath107 figure  [ fig : instab ] shows the critical stability curves for models with thin ( solid line ) and thick ( dotted line ) crusts , with @xmath97 , @xmath90 , @xmath89 and @xmath108 all equal to one . in other words ,",
    "the proper label for the abscissa of this plot is @xmath109 . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the stability curve for a purely fluid @xmath101 polytrope ( @xcite , @xcite , dashed line ) , as well as the curve with @xmath85 independent of spin frequency ( dash - dotted line , cf .",
    "bu ) . neglecting the shear viscosity in the interior of the star",
    "is clearly justified .    for the thin crust model ( solid line ) ,",
    "the slippage in the frequency range of interest does not rise or fall sharply , and so the critical frequency is a single - valued , monotonically decreasing function of @xmath110 .",
    "however , for the neutron star with a thick crust , the slippage and the damping rise sharply at the spin frequency close to the second avoided crossing .",
    "therefore , the critical temperature is not a monotonically decreasing function of the spin frequency @xmath111 , and the stability curve is multi - valued .",
    "such a non - trivial stability curve should be interpreted in terms of the critical temperature , rather than the critical frequency : for temperatures larger than the critical one given by eq .",
    "( [ t8 ] ) , i.e. , for points in the @xmath110@xmath111 plane which lie to the right of the viscous boundary layer part of stability curve , the r - mode is unstable and grows .",
    "otherwise , the r - mode is stable and decays .",
    "observationally , the spin frequencies of neutron stars in lmxbs have been inferred from the qpo - like flux modulation during the type  i x - ray bursts ( the so - called burst qpos , see @xcite for a review ) . in two out of the six sources displaying the burst qpos ,",
    "the frequency is close to @xmath5  hz , while in the remaining four it is close to @xmath84  hz . in one of the latter four systems",
    ", @xcite found a subharmonic at around @xmath5  hz , and has argued that this subharmonic corresponds to the true spin frequency .",
    "same relation is sometimes believed to hold for the other @xmath112  hz bursters .",
    "in addition , @xmath113  hz spin is often argued on the basis of a beat frequency interpretation of the khz qpo peak separation in all six of the burst qpo systems , as well as for the neutron stars in thirteen additional lmxbs that do not display burst qpos . on the other hand , there is no compelling theoretical picture for why the subharmonics of the @xmath112  hz burst qpos should be so weak or invisible , so a bimodal spin distribution is certainly not ruled out .    the new critical stability curves computed in this paper for two toy models of neutron stars cut right through the observed range of spins both for neutron stars in lmxbs and for millisecond pulsars , for temperatures of interest for accreting neutron stars ( between @xmath94  k and @xmath114  k ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an accreting neutron star can continue its spin - up so long as it is located to the left of the stability curve in figure  [ fig : instab ] .",
    "however , once it crosses the critical stability curve and is located to the right from it , the r - mode will grow and halt the spin - up , probably forcing the neutron star into a thermal runaway cycle @xcite .",
    "the details of what happens during this runaway and how violent it is are a topic of current research . for example , the displacements induced in the crust may cause it break when the strain ( which is of order the r - mode amplitude @xmath115 , as defined in @xcite ) exceeds a critical value ( @xmath116 , see   6.1 of @xcite and references therein for a summary of estimates of crustal breaking strains ) or melt if the heating due to the viscous boundary layer raises its temperature above @xmath105  k ( see @xcite for the calculation of the r - mode amplitude required to melt the crust ) .",
    "the evolution of the spin frequency and the temperature depends on the saturation of the r - mode growth , which is not currently understood . despite these uncertainties , it is clear that , if the r - mode instability operates in accreting neutron stars , the non - trivial shape of the stability curve and its sensitivity to the crustal structure will be reflected in a peculiar , non - uniform spin distribution of accreting neutron stars and millisecond pulsars .",
    "much work is necessary in order to make robust comparisons with observations .",
    "r - mode calculations for more realistic neutron star models , taking into account the complicated structure of the crust are in progress .",
    "we have not considered the possible superfluid nature of neutrons and protons at the crust - core interface . in particular , we have not considered the pinning of the superfluid vortices to the crust .",
    "we assumed that the boundary layer is laminar , which may not be true for large r - mode amplitudes .",
    "significant magnetic field at the crust - core boundary may also affect the crust - core coupling @xcite .",
