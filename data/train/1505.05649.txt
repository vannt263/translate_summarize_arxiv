    "the last solar minimum at the end of solar cycle 23 has been characterized by several aspects , very peculiar and different in comparison with the previous minimum .",
    "polar coronal holes appear smaller , and polar magnetic flux measured at the solar surface is 40@xmath2 weaker relative to 1996 minimum ( kirk _ et al . _ , 2009 ) , magnetic fields measured in the solar wind above the sun s poles are depleted by a similar amount ( about a third ; smith and balogh , 2008 ) , solar wind density is decreased ( by 17 - 20@xmath2 ) , and the bulk solar wind speed is slightly slower ( @xmath3 ; mccomas _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "this period has been exceptionally quiet , with sunspot numbers at their lowest in a century and the presence of low - latitude large coronal holes implies strong , long and recurring high speed streams in the solar wind at the earth s orbit ( gibson _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , the coronal magnetic topology is rather unexpected for a solar minimum based on what we had observed in other space - age minima . instead of the classical dipolar configuration with a single equatorial belt ,",
    "the magnetic structure is more complex and , in particular , it is characterized by the presence of two different kinds of coronal streamers called pseudo - streamers and bipolar streamers ( riley _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ) .",
    "pseudo - streamers or unipolar streamer are coronal structures which separate coronal holes of the same polarity , overlying twin loop arcades without a current sheet in the outer corona ( _ e.g. _ zhao and webb 2003 ; wang _ et al . _ , 2007 ) .",
    "bipolar streamers or helmet streamer overlie a single ( or an odd number of ) loop arcades in the lower corona and they have oppositely oriented open magnetic field in the upper corona , such that a current sheet is present between the two open field domains .",
    "slow wind _ in - situ _ measurements associated with a pseudo - streamer indicate wind speed in the range of about 350 - 550 km s@xmath4 with oxygen charge - state ratio ( @xmath5/n@xmath6 ) greater than fast wind values and lower than slow wind values ( wang _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "( 2013 ) analysed _ ulysses _ observations of solar wind proton flux extremes originating from sources middle - distant from the heliospheric current sheet , likely related to pseudo - streamer structures .",
    "moreover , interplanetary signatures derived by the _ advanced composition explorer _ ( ace ) data at 1 au show that pseudo - streamer flows have all the same characteristics as slow wind flows , that is low speed and proton temperature and high density and composition ratio , but less pronounced in pseudo - streamers ( riley _ et al . _ , 2012 ; crooker _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) .",
    "the analysis presented here concerns a coronal pseudo - streamer and a bipolar streamer observed in the period 12 - 17 march 2008 by soho / uvcs at high spectral and spatial resolution , in order to compare the physical parameters of these coronal structures , such as kinetic temperature of h i ly @xmath1 and o vi spectral lines , electron density and outflow velocity .",
    "the diagnostic techniques that we apply to derive the electron density as a function of outflow velocity is described in section 2 , the uvcs observations and the identification of the coronal structures are described in section 3 and the 3d magneto - hydrodynamic model used for the extrapolations of the coronal magnetic field is illustrated in section 4 . finally , sections 5 and 6 are dedicated to the data analysis and the discussion of the results , respectively .",
    "we derive the outflow velocity and electron density of the coronal wind plasma from the emission of the doublet o  vi 1032 and 1038  spectral lines observed by uvcs .",
    "these lines are formed in the extended corona via collisional and radiative excitation processes ( _ e.g. _ withbroe _ et al .",

    "( 2004 ) and already applied in the analysis by abbo _",
    "( 2010 ) . because the two components have a different dependence on the electron density ( the collisional process depends on @xmath7 , while the radiative process depends linearly on electron density @xmath8 )",
    ", it results that the electron density , averaged along the line - of - sight ( los ) , @xmath9 , is proportional to the ratio of the collisional component @xmath10 to the radiative component @xmath11 , and is a function of the outflow velocity of the wind , * w * , through the relationship @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the doppler dimming function which depends on the normalized coronal absorption profile and on the intensity of the exciting spectrum along the direction of the incident radiation , @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is the shift of the disk spectrum introduced by the expansion velocity , * w * , of the coronal absorbing ions / atoms along the direction @xmath14 , and @xmath16 is the reference wavelength of the transition . as the wavelength shift increases , the resonantly scattered emission decreases , giving origin to the doppler dimming effect ( beckers and chipman , 1974 ; noci _ et al .",
    "_ , 1987 ) . by analysing the o  vi doublet lines at 1031.93 and 1037.62  ,",
    "it is possible to measure oxygen ion outflow velocities ( averaged along the los on the plane of sky ) up to approximately 450 km s@xmath4 for the effect of pumping of the cii lines at 1037.02 and 1036.34   on the o  vi @xmath17  1037.61  line ( _ e.g. _ dodero _ et al . _ , 1998 ; cranmer _ et al .",

    "since we want to determine the structure of the coronal magnetic field for cr 2067 and to derive the expansion factors of the flow tubes corresponding to the uvcs observations , we have used mas ( magnetohydrodynamics outside a sphere ) , the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) model of linker _ et al . _",

    "the same equations are also solved to determine all the properties at the outer boundary , where the flow is supersonic and super alfvnic .",

    "the pseudo - streamer presents open magnetic field lines while the bipolar streamer is characterized by closed field lines in the region observed by uvcs .",
    "in order to derive the plasma conditions of the coronal structures , the intensities of the spectral lines are integrated in the two regions defined between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( counterclockwise from the north pole , 84 arcsec along the slit ) for the pseudo - streamer and between @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( counterclockwise from the north pole , 616 arcsec along the slit ) for the bipolar streamer .",

    "it has been applied an ad - hoc procedure for these observations and for the whole heliosphere interval , an international campaign to study the three - dimensional solar - heliospheric - planetary connected system near solar minimum which started on 20 march 2008 , just after the observations that we planned and here presented analysed .",
    "the integrated emissions are then fitted with a gaussian function , representing the coronal profile , convolved with a lorentzian curve which accounts for the instrumental broadening and a rectangular function accounting for the width of the spectrometer slit .",
    "the function resulting from the convolution is added to a background linearly dependent on wavelength .",
    "the best fit is obtained by applying the least square method , deriving the observed line intensity as the integral over the gaussian line profile . the electron density and the outflow velocity",
    "are derived , as discussed in the previous section , by applying the method which is based on the hypothesis of the expansion factors of the flux tubes connecting the corona and heliosphere .",

    "it is evident that the expansion factors of pseudo - streamer are much lower than the values for bipolar streamer , of a factor 2 - 3 .",
    "they are closer to coronal hole values but with a different derivative in the height range 1.5 - 2.5 @xmath0 , which is the region of uvcs observations .        moreover , as already described by antonucci _",
    "( 2005 ) and by abbo _",
    "( 2010 ) , the distribution of the oxygen ion velocity in three dimensions has to be assumed , since , in a given volume , the absorption of the photons of the exciting spectrum is controlled by the coronal absorption profile along the incident direction in a solid angle subtending the disk of the sun .",
    "the solar wind is assumed to be radial and the velocity distribution along the two directions perpendicular to the radial is considered to be the same .",
    "the kinetic temperature of oxygen ions , @xmath37 , expressed in terms of the spectral line width observed by uvcs , is a measure of the velocity distribution width along the los .",

    "the isotropic hypothesis is applied inside the bipolar streamer since the electron and ion densities are higher and due to the approximately static conditions of the plasma , the isotropy of the ion velocity distribution is established via ion - ion collision . for the pseudo - streamer , we assume both an isotropic and anisotropic velocity distribution since they represent an intermediate condition between closed field regions and the core region of coronal holes , where the ion velocity distributions are found to be highly anisotropic ( _ e.g. _ cranmer _ et  al . _ , 1999 ; antonucci _ et  al .",

    "we point out that the @xmath38 values do not influence significantly the results of the analysis of electron density and outflow velocity : by assuming the electron temperature values of coronal hole , the obtained results are within the errors shown in figures 7 and 8 ( see the following section ) .",
    "the coronal plasma physical parameters have been derived for a pseudo - streamer and a bipolar streamer which are now compared with those of a bipolar streamer and of a coronal hole observed by soho / uvcs in 1996 and already published by abbo _",

    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) , respectively .",
    "the kinetic temperature of ions , @xmath37 , expressed in terms of the spectral line width observed by uvcs , @xmath41 , is a measure of the velocity distribution of the ions along the line of sight and can be written as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ion mass number , m@xmath44 is the proton mass , @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant , c is the light speed and @xmath16 is the center wavelength of the spectral line .",
    "the width of the velocity distribution of the atoms / ions is the result primarily by thermal motions .",
