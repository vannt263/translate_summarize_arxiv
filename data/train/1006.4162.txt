    "the first truly large variability survey of extragalactic sources at mid - infrared ( mid - ir , 3.68.0 ) wavelengths is the _ spitzer",
    "_ deep , wide - field survey ( sdwfs ; @xcite ) of the noao deep wide - field survey ( @xcite ) botes field .",
    "the survey spans the years 2004 - 2008 with four epochs , covers 8 deg@xmath10 , and contains variability statistics for nearly half a million sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the majority ( @xmath11% ) of the extragalactic variable objects in the mid - ir are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , there is room for serendipitous discoveries such as supernovae ( sne ) .    in general ,",
    "sdwfs was not expected to be interesting for sne searches .",
    "first , the contrast between sne and their hosts is relatively poor in the mid - ir , essentially because of differences in the effective temperatures .",
    "if we match the bolometric luminosities of an sn and a typical host galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , the sn contributes @xmath12 of the v - band flux but only @xmath13 of the @xmath14 m flux .",
    "second , with only four epochs of data , we expected sdwfs would add little to our understanding sns even if one were detected . third , the expected rates are very low . typical type ia ( iip ) sn peak at @xmath15 } \\sim m_k \\sim -18.4 $ ] ( @xmath16 ) mag ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so sdwfs can detect them in a single epoch only for redshifts @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . given the sne ia rates from the sdss - ii supernova survey ( @xcite ) and sne type ii rate ( @xcite ) , we would then expect to detect only of order one type ia sn and of order seven type ii sne in the sdwfs survey even if we could safely search for them at the @xmath19 detection level for a single epoch ( @xmath20=19.1 $ ]  mag ) . in practice , controlling the false positive rates for identifying variable sources means that the variability selection criteria must be significantly more conservative than a @xmath19 peak at the detection limit ( see @xcite ) , so we did not expect to detect any sne in sdwfs .    there is a subclass of type iin sne that are far more luminous , reaching @xmath15 } \\sim m_k \\sim -20 $ ] mag ( e.g. , ) , which we could detect up to @xmath21 . the leading theory for these",
    "sne uses collisions between two massive shells of material to efficiently radiate the kinetic energy of the sn in the optical ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the fast moving sn ejecta collides with an outer , slower moving shell on scales of order @xmath22  au where the optical depth is high enough to produce a well - defined photosphere but low enough for the thermal energy from the shock to be radiated before adiabatic expansion converts it back into kinetic energy .",
    "but these sne are rare , representing only @xmath23 of the local type ii sne rate ( @xcite ) , which more than balances the increased detection volume .    here",
    "we investigate the nature the brightest mid - ir transient in sdwfs . over a 6 month period , this @xmath24 source radiated @xmath25  ergs at a black body temperature of @xmath6  k. in section  [ sec : data ] we present the available uv , optical and mid - ir data along with a keck spectrum of the host galaxy .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : results ] we consider a range of possible scenarios for producing this source and conclude that a simple variant of the models for the hyper - luminous type iin sne is the best explanation for this source .",
    "the paper is summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] . throughout this paper",
    "we use a standard @xmath26cdm model with @xmath27 and @xmath28wright / cosmocalc.html ] .",
    "all magnitudes are in the vega system .",
    "sdwfs - mt-1 ( aka sn  2007va ; @xcite ) , where mt means mid - ir transient as a parallel notation to using ot for optical transient , is the most significantly variable source in the entire sdwfs field .",
    "it corresponds to the sdwfs source sdwfs j142623.24@xmath29353529.1 .",
    "the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] light curves were strongly correlated ( @xmath30 ) and the variability amplitude was 76 standard deviations from the mean for its average magnitude . a detailed definition of these variability criteria is given in @xcite .",
    "the sdwfs survey consists of four epochs , taken 3.5 years , 6 months , and 1 month apart .",
    "the object is not detected in any of the four irac bands in the first epoch ( also known as the irac shallow survey , @xcite ) on 2004 january 10 - 14 ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "the observed part of the transient peaked in the second epoch taken 2007 august 8 - 13 ( @xmath36 ) at @xmath20=15.93 $ ] mag and @xmath33=15.61 $ ] mag ( figures  [ fig : sdwfs ] and [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",

    "we present all the available _ spitzer _ data in table  [ tab : sdwfsdata ] .",
    "irac ( @xcite ) simultaneously observes the @xmath20/[5.8]$ ] or @xmath33/[8.0]$ ] bands , and in sdwfs the @xmath33/[8.0]$ ] observations were taken 40 seconds after the @xmath20/[5.8]$ ] ones .",
    "each epoch consists of three 30 second exposures in each band , taken no more than 2 days apart , and the images for the whole mosaics were taken within 5 days .",
    "we confirmed that the transient was present in the individual artifact - corrected basic calibrated data ( cbcd ) frames corresponding to the position of the transient .",
    "the mosaic image for each epoch is then a combination of three to four of these frames , and there is no indication of problems in the sdwfs reductions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained a keck / lris ( @xcite ) spectrum of the transient s host galaxy on 2010 march 12 , long after the transient was gone .",
    "the spectrum ( shown in figure  [ fig : keck_spectrum ] ) shows clear emission lines of h@xmath39 , h@xmath40 , h@xmath41 , h@xmath42 , h@xmath43 , and h@xmath44 , [ oii ] at 3727 , [ o iii ] at 4363 , 4959 and 5007 , [ neiii ] at 3869 and 3968 .",
    "the redshift of the host galaxy is @xmath45 , so the luminosity distance is 920 mpc , the distance modulus is 39.82 mag , and the angular scale is 3.15 kpc / arcsec . before measuring the line fluxes , we corrected the host galaxy spectrum for galactic extinction ( e(b@xmath46v@xmath47 mag ) using @xcite .",
    "we do not detect the [ nii ] 6584  line , which implies log([nii]/h@xmath48 . combining it with log([oiii ] 5007 / h@xmath49",
    ", we conclude that the host is an irregular hii galaxy ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "the lack of [ nii ] and [ nev ] 3426  lines and the clear detection of the 4363  line rule out the presence of an agn .",
    "we followed the prescription of @xcite to derive the gas - phase oxygen abundance of the host .",
    "we measured the fluxes of the [ oii ] 3727 , [ oiii ] 4363 , [ oiii ] 4959 , [ oiii ] 5007 and h@xmath40 4861 emission lines to find a metallicity of @xmath50 .",
    "we assumed an electron density of @xmath51 @xmath52 , but the value does not change significantly with changes in the electron density ( e.g. , @xmath53 if we use @xmath54 @xmath52 instead ) .",
    "next , we verified this metallicity measurement using the prescriptions of to get @xmath55 . as a cross check",
    ", we also used the oxygen - to - hydrogen flux ratio @xmath56+[oiii]})/{\\rm h}\\beta=(f_{\\lambda3727}+f_{\\lambda4959}+f_{\\lambda5007})/f_{\\lambda4861}$ ] method of @xcite and the @xcite o3n2 method to derive oxygen abundances .",
    "the clear detection of the 4363  line and log([nii]/h@xmath48 strongly suggests that we should use the `` lower '' metallicity branch in the @xmath57 method .",
    "we use the relations from @xcite and with our measured @xmath58 , to get oxygen abundances of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the o3n2 method gives @xmath61 .",
    "all these estimates are approximately 10% of the solar value ( assuming 8.8 from @xcite ) .      in order to understand the origin of this mid - ir transient , we searched for any available uv and optical data for this area of the sky in the relevant time span .",
    "the host galaxy was detected in the original noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs , @xcite ) with @xmath62 mag ( @xmath63 ergs / s ) , @xmath64 mag ( @xmath65 ergs / s ) , and @xmath66 mag ( @xmath67 ergs / s ) .",
    "it was unresolved in @xmath68 arcsec ( fwhm ) seeing , which puts an upper limit on the size of the galaxy of 3.8 kpc . in archival galex ( @xcite )",
    "data , the host has nuv@xmath69 mag and no detection in fuv . the galex source is formally 087 from the sdwfs / ndwfs source , but there are no other blue sources within 20  arcsec .",
    "both the colors of the host and its size are consistent with a blue , low luminosity , low metallicity galaxy .",
    "we used the template model of an irregular galaxy from @xcite to estimate the mid - ir magnitudes of the host .",
    "fitting the galex nuv , and ndwfs @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72-band magnitudes of the host galaxy , and assuming @xmath45 , the expected apparent ( absolute ) irac magnitudes are @xmath20   = 20.87~(-18.56)$ ] mag , @xmath33   = 20.69~(-18.57)$ ] mag , @xmath34   = 20.52~(-20.02)$ ] mag , and @xmath35   = 18.37~(-21.45)$ ] mag .",
    "this is consistent with the failure to detect the host in the first sdwfs epoch .",
    "we estimate rest frame host luminosities of @xmath73 mag and @xmath74 mag , making this an @xmath75 galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the field was monitored by at least 5 optical variability surveys , the peak of the transient occurred when the field was `` behind '' the sun , so almost all the optical data corresponds to the periods before epoch 2 and after epoch 4 .",
    "the botes field was observed seven times between @xmath76 and @xmath77 with the 8k@xmath788k mosaic ccd camera on the 2.4 meter mdm hiltner telescope .",
    "the two most interesting observations took place 90 days before the second and 84 days after the fourth sdwfs epoch , bracketing the period of the transient . in these 180 second exposures",
    ", we detected no flux from the transient ( or the host ) at a @xmath32 level of @xmath79 mag ( @xmath80 ergs / s ) and @xmath81 mag ( @xmath82 ergs / s ) , respectively .    the catalina sky survey ( css , @xcite)/catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , @xcite ) provides light curves for the period prior to epoch 2 and overlapping epochs 3 and 4 .",
    "each epoch of four 30 second exposures on the 0.7 meter catalina schmidt telescope reaches an r - band magnitude limit of @xmath83  mag .",
    "these data provide the strongest limit on the optical - to - mid - ir flux ratios , where a stack of 12 images ( 3 epochs ) , gives a @xmath32 upper limit on the transient of @xmath84 mag , corresponding to @xmath85 ergs / s ( large dark green symbol to the right in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) , in the period between epochs 3 and 4 .    the quest ( @xcite ) survey further limits the optical emission before epoch 2 and after epoch 4 .",
    "there are 19 epochs each consisting of 1 to 4 , 60 - 100  sec exposures with the 1.2 m samuel oschin telescope in a wide red / ir filter that we calibrated to @xmath86-band .",
    "the most interesting data were taken @xmath87 days prior epoch 2 , where we stacked six adjacent quest epochs ( @xmath88@xmath89 ) to obtain @xmath32 detection limit of @xmath90 mag ( @xmath91 ergs / s , large orange symbol in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .    similarly , by coadding the high cadence raptor ( rapid telescopes for optical response , @xcite ) observations of the field ,",
    "each of which is a 30  sec exposure using the raptor - p array of four 200-mm canon telephoto lenses , we obtained 15 upper limits at various epochs between 2004 and 2008 , before and after the transient ( figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "calibrating the unfiltered observations to an @xmath71-band equivalent using tycho 2 stars , we find no evidence for the transient , with @xmath92  mag ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "only the northern station of the all sky automated survey ( asas ) data ( @xcite ) obtained data during the peak of the transient .",
    "combining 7 high quality asas images during the transient ( @xmath93@xmath94 ) , we obtain a weak upper limit on the transient magnitude of @xmath95 mag ( @xmath32 ) , corresponding to @xmath96 ergs / s .",
    "the steeply falling , roughly power law sed of the transient ( figure  [ fig : transientsed ] ) is suggestive of thermal emission by a source cooler than normal stars .",
    "if we fit the sed as dust emission using an emissivity of @xmath97 , we find good fits with @xmath98 as is typical of the mid - ir emission by warm dust ( e.g. ) .",
    "the temperature of @xmath99  k varies little between epochs ( table  [ tab : sdwfsdata ] ) and is below typical dust destruction temperatures of @xmath100 k ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "table  [ tab : sdwfsdata ] summarizes these estimates of the temperatures and luminosities .",
    "a zeroth order estimate ( ignoring the dust emissivity ) of the radius @xmath71 of the dust photosphere is @xmath101 we are assuming that the shell is optically thick and @xmath71 corresponds to the radius where the ( optical ) optical depth is of order unity .",
    "if the dust is optically thin , as the case for typical dust echos , there is no characteristic radius or temperature since photons can be absorbed and emitted at any distance from the sn .",
    "we discuss these issues in more detail below . for the second and third epochs of sdwfs , with total luminosity @xmath102",
    "ergs / s and temperature @xmath99  k , we find the radius to be @xmath103 au ( 0.05 pc ) .",
    "the total energy radiated in the ir is then @xmath104 ergs .",
    "the weak optical limits mean that a comparable amount of energy might have been radiated in the optical .",
    "we used the more sophisticated radiation transport model dusty ( @xcite ) to check this estimate . for incident black body spectra with temperatures 10,00020,000  k , shell geometries with constant density , and dust temperatures at the inner photosphere edge of 13002000  k , we could match the epoch 2 and 3 seds , including a weak optical limit , using shells dominated by graphite , a visual optical depth of @xmath1053 , and a radius @xmath106@xmath107  au .",
    "pure silicate dusts were unable to fit the data well , producing the wrong spectral shape for reasonable @xmath108 and inner dust temperatures .",
    "these results are consistent with our simple estimates and strongly suggest that there was an optical counterpart , albeit with significant extinction ( @xmath109 mag ) .    before outlining our preferred explanation of the transient as a self - obscured supernova",
    ", we briefly outline the hypotheses we rejected .",
    "first , the transient can not be explained by a galactic star .",
    "the arguments against are as follows : ( 1 ) based on the keck spectrum , we know that the source is spatially coincident with an irregular galaxy ; ( 2 ) few stars can brighten by at least 5 magnitudes ( by more than a hundred times ) in the mid - ir and then stay at this level for 6 months before fading ; and ( 3 ) most flaring stars do not flare in the mid - ir but in the uv .",
    "there are exceptions to ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , and these will generally be accreting systems where the disk can alter the spectral properties . however , the ndwfs field is a high latitude ( @xmath110 ) field with negligible galactic extinction and unlikely to contain young ( protostars ) or massive ( be stars ) with these characteristics , particularly if they must also have no optical counterpart in quiescence despite needing to be nearby sources because of the short path length out of the disk .",
    "the second possibility is that we are really observing an agn .",
    "first , we note that there are no signs of agn activity in the host spectrum .",
    "the narrow lines in a galaxy are on relatively large scales , and should show line ratios averaged over decades ( or more ) of agn activity , so the lack of a spectrum during the transient does not invalidate using them to argue against an agn .",
    "moreover , the mid - ir colors at the peak of the transient , @xmath20-[4.5]=0.3 $ ] mag and @xmath34-[8.0]=0.0 $ ] mag ( epoch 2 ) , are inconsistent with that of an agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the composite sed of an agn and its host can have these colors , we know from the host flux limits in the first epoch that the sed at the peak should be dominated by the agn , and a pure agn at @xmath111 should have mid - ir colors closer to @xmath20-[4.5 ] \\simeq 0.8 $ ] mag and @xmath34-[8.0 ] \\simeq 1.1 $ ] mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also considered the possibility of a tidally disrupted star in the context of the super - eddington accretion models of @xcite . while these models have an inflated , relatively cool envelope around the black hole , the expected temperatures of @xmath112 m@xmath113  k for a black hole of mass @xmath114 are still too high . a black hole with low enough mass ( @xmath115 m@xmath116 ) to match the temperature ( @xmath117  k ) would be unable to produce the observed luminosity .",
    "the eddington luminosity for such a low mass is only @xmath118  ergs / s .",
    "the third possibility is that it is a @xmath41-ray burst ( grb ) .",
    "we can rule it out as direct emission from a burst because the time scale ( 6 months ) is too long and the sed is wrong for direct beamed emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it can not be indirect emission , where a dusty region absorbs and reradiates emission from the jet , because a relativistic jet expands past the scale of the photosphere ( @xmath119  au ) too quickly ( @xmath120 rest - frame days ) to produce the observed event duration .",
    "finally , this can not be gravitational lensing of a background object by the host galaxy ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the time scales are such that it would have to be microlensing by the stars in the lens galaxy , but there are no known mid - ir sources that are sufficiently compact to show such a large , and apparently achromatic , degree of magnification .",
    "moreover , almost any potential source would have to show a still stronger degree of optical magnification that would disagree even with our weak optical limits ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our working hypothesis is that sdwfs - mt-1 is a supernova analogous to sn  2006gy , an extremely luminous type  iin sn ( @xcite ) .",
    "sn  2006gy peaked at @xmath121 mag , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath122 ergs / s , and it radiated of order @xmath123 ergs in total ( @xcite ) . in a normal type  ii sn , a very small fraction ( @xmath124% ) of the available energy is radiated .",
    "the initial energy from the shock is converted into kinetic energy by adiabatic expansion , leaving little to power the luminosity .",
    "thus , a supernova ejecting @xmath125 at velocities of @xmath126  km / s contains enough kinetic energy , @xmath127  ergs to power the transient , but it is only radiated on time scales of order 10@xmath128 years as the sn remnant develops .",
    "the scenario we present was proposed by @xcite for sn  2006gy with further elaborations in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "very massive stars ( @xmath129 ) are known to undergo impulsive events ejecting significant fractions of the stellar envelope .",
    "the most famous example is the eruption of @xmath8 carina in 1837 - 1857 ( see ) , but also includes some of the so - called `` supernova impostors '' ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the number and temporal distributions of these mass ejections relative to the final supernova is unknown , but there are several cases where one seems to have occurred shortly before the final supernova ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "pair instability sne can also produce a sequence of mass ejections just prior to the death of the star ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us suppose that the progenitor of sdwfs - mt-1 was such a massive star and had two such eruptions in its final phases , roughly 300 and 5 years before the final explosion , each of which ejected of order @xmath130 . for a typical ejection velocity of @xmath131  km / s ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", these shells would lie roughly 13000 and 200  au from the star when it exploded .",
    "the role of the first shell is to convert the kinetic energy of the explosion into radiation following @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the collision between the ejected material and the first shell can extract fraction @xmath132 of the kinetic energy and convert it to radiation .",
    "the distance to the shell is tuned so that the shock crossing time is comparable to the thomson photon diffusion time , thereby allowing the radiation to escape without significant adiabatic losses .",
    "this requires a total mass of approximately @xmath133 where @xmath134  au and @xmath135  km / s .",
    "we can get up to @xmath136 either by making @xmath137  au or by allowing for adiabatic losses .",
    "this then implies characteristic time , energy , luminosity and temperature scales of @xmath138  days , @xmath139  ergs , @xmath140  ergs / s , and @xmath141  k , respectively , where we have used the estimate of the total mass and equally divided it between the shell and the sn ejecta .",
    "the basic energetics , but not the radiation transport , are largely confirmed by the simulations of @xcite .",
    "this set our choice of incident temperature in the dusty models .",
    "thus , a shell of ejected material at @xmath142  au can produce the necessary energetics and luminosities but can not match the observed time scales ( too short ) or temperatures ( too high ) .",
    "the role of the second shell is to match the time and temperature scales . @xcite and",
    "@xcite invoke a second @xmath143 shell located at @xmath144  pc in order to explain the relatively bright , long - lived ir emission observed for sn  2006gy .",
    "their shell is , however , optically thin to optical light ( @xmath145 ) because the total infrared emission is only a small fraction of the total .",
    "the optical depth of a shell is of order @xmath146 for @xmath147 in cm@xmath10/g , which leads to an optically thin shell with @xmath149 for an @xmath150  pc shell radius and @xmath151  cm@xmath10/g for a radiation temperature of order @xmath152  k ( e.g. , ) .",
    "this opacity , @xmath153  cm@xmath10/g , corresponds to a dust - to - gas ratio of approximately 1% , which arguably may be high for a low metallicity galaxy .",
    "note , however , that sn  2006gy is probably also associated with a low metallicity galaxy ( see  3.4 ) and the shell producing its dust echo contains enough dust for our scenario .    to explain sdwfs - mt-1 we simply move the shell inward . at this point , however , we should improve on eqn .",
    "( [ eq : radius ] ) with a simple model for an optically thick dust echo .",
    "suppose that the dust lies in an optically thick spherical shell of radius @xmath71 and is exposed to luminosity @xmath154 for a period of time @xmath155 . because all the dust is exposed to the same luminosity , the dust temperature is independent of position or time while irradiated .",
    "the observer , however , sees the luminosity pulse modulated by the light travel time @xmath156 across the shell . in this simple model ,",
    "the light curves are trapezoids with linear rises and falls connected by a plateau created by the changing fraction of the shell illuminated by the outburst from the observer s perspective , but the dust temperature is constant .",
    "models that can reproduce the drop in luminosity between epochs 3 and 4 have the pulse time @xmath157 , with the simplest model having the luminosity plateau run from epoch 2 to epoch 3 . the plateau duration is @xmath158  days while the rise and falls last @xmath155 .",
    "the luminosity of the plateau is @xmath159 , which is smaller than @xmath160 by the ratio @xmath161 between the light crossing time and the pulse length ( if @xmath162 the plateau luminosity is @xmath154 ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath163 drop in luminosity between epochs 3 and 4 is @xmath164 where @xmath165  days is the time between these epochs .",
    "thus , we have @xmath166  days , and @xmath167  au or @xmath168 light days . with these time and distance",
    "scales we come close to matching the epoch 2 and 3 luminosities given the observed temperatures , with an estimated luminosity of @xmath169  ergs / s .",
    "the true luminosity is @xmath170  ergs / s , which is why the radius estimate is somewhat larger than the estimates of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : radius ] ) .",
    "there is some tension between the plateau luminosity and the drop in luminosity between the last two epochs , but the overall agreement is good given the crudeness of the model both for the dust emission and the luminosity profiles .",
    "the mass required to produce an a shell with optical depth @xmath108 at this distance is @xmath171 , so there is little difficulty having an optically thick shell for masses of order @xmath172-@xmath173 even if the dust - to - gas ratio needs to be significantly reduced from @xmath174 because of the low metallicity of the galaxy .",
    "while the dust temperature is close to that for destroying dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the situation is somewhat different from a normal supernova because the ( thomson ) optically thick inner shell protects the outer from any initial high luminosity bursts of hard radiation . for the ir - radiation , @xmath175  cm@xmath10/g , and",
    "the shell is optically thin to the mid - ir emission for reasonable shell masses , so the dust emission streams freely to the observer .",
    "given the estimated pulse duration , @xmath166  days , and luminosity , @xmath176  ergs / s , we can estimate that the inner shell is at @xmath177  au , the velocity must be @xmath178  km / s and the mass involved must be @xmath179 , where the rapid decline pushes these values to small radii / masses and high velocities in order to keep @xmath155 short . given the crudeness of the model , it is remarkable how well all the observational features can be matched using relatively sensible physical parameters .",
    "the nature of the host galaxy indirectly supports this hypothesis because both grbs and most hyper - luminous type iin sne are also associated with low luminosity , low metallicity dwarf galaxies .",

    "a second event like swfs - mt-1 would have to be even more extreme .",
    "given the paucity of the data , interpreting this source as a false positive seems the most probable explanation .",
    "for events with six month durations like sdwfs - mt-1 our survey time coverage is approximately @xmath220  years .",
    "sdwfs - mt-1 peaked in epoch two at fluxes of @xmath221 mjy in [ 3.6 ] and @xmath222 mjy in [ 4.5 ] at a luminosity distance of @xmath223  mpc .",
    "the peak flux limit for our systematic search is @xmath224jy ( @xmath19 in [ 4.5 ] ) which means we could have detected sdwfs - mt-1 at a luminosity distance of @xmath225  mpc ( @xmath226 ) or about @xmath227 ignoring @xmath228-corrections , which will initially aid detection because the sed peaks bluewards of the irac bands .",
    "thus , we could detect the source in a comoving volume of approximately @xmath229  mpc@xmath128 . combining these factors",
    ", we estimate a rate for sdwfs - mt-1-like transients of @xmath230  mpc@xmath231  yr@xmath232 where we have not corrected the time scales for redshifting effects given the otherwise large uncertainties from the statistics of one event .",
    "this is approximately @xmath233 of the type ii sne rate ( @xcite ) , @xmath234 of the hyper - luminous type ii sne ( @xcite ) , and @xmath7 of the grb rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we presented the discovery of a luminous mid - ir transient , sdwfs - mt-1 , that is unusual in several ways .",
    "its most striking features are the high luminosity , @xmath235  ergs / s , the low apparent temperature , @xmath236  k , the long , 6 month duration of the event , and the resulting high amount of radiated energy , @xmath237 ergs . a model that explains the transient is a self - obscured supernova , that has two concentric ( patchy ) shells , each with the mass of @xmath7 m@xmath116 , ejected prior to the sn explosion . the inner shell at @xmath238 au protects the dust in the outer shell from initial luminosity spikes and converts the high kinetic energy of the sn shock wave into thermalized radiation with @xmath239  k. the dust in the more distant ( 0.05 pc ) second shell absorbs the radiation of the first shell , and reradiates it at @xmath240  k , while simultaneously smoothing out and stretching the light curve .",
    "this scenario matches the observed energy , luminosity , time and temperature scales of the transient by slightly modifying the scenarios used for other hyper - luminous type iin sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the host galaxy of the transient is also typical of these sne , and our estimate of the rate is consistent with such events being @xmath7% of hyper - luminous type ii sne .    the discovery of the progenitors of sn  2008s and ngc300-ot-1 ( @xcite ) as self - obscured ( @xmath241  k , @xmath242 ) stars already indicated that mid - ir observations are necessary to understanding the fates of massive stars .",
    "if our interpretation of sdwfs - mt-1 is correct , then this may extend to the actual transients as well as to their progenitors , although it is quite likely that sdwfs - mt-1 was also a significant optical transient .",
    "ir dust echos from sne are relatively common , ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but in these cases the optical depth of the dust is low and the ir emission is only a fraction of what is observed in the optical . a few recent sne with significant echo luminosities are sn 2007od ( @xcite ) , sn 2006gy ( @xcite ) , sn 2004et ( @xcite ) , and sn 2002hh ( @xcite ) .",
    "obviously there is a strong selection effect against optically selecting sne where the optical depth of the surviving dust is near unity , so the true abundance of such sources can only be determined in near / mid - ir searches .",
    "there have been some searches made in the near - ir ( e.g. , ) , principally focused on the problem of unassociated foreground absorption rather than dust associated with the progenitor star .",
    "two important steps are to try and identify massive stars with such dense shells of ejected material , similar to the search for self - obscured stars in @xcite and @xcite , and to better characterize the mid - ir emission of other hyper - luminous type iin sne .",
    "if the inner shell invoked to convert the kinetic energy into radiation is dusty , the progenitor will appear as a rapidly cooling near / mid - ir source as the shell expands .",
    "such shells will have temperatures of order the 400  k observed for sn  2008s or ngc300-ot-1 but should show the time variability known to be absent for the sn  2008s progenitor ( see @xcite ) . for the dust to survive the sn explosion and produce a powerful mid - ir transient",
    ", it must be considerably more distant and colder than the @xmath243  k dust photosphere of the progenitors of sn  2008s or ngc300-ot-1 , with temperatures of order @xmath244  k and seds peaking at 20 - 30@xmath9 m that will make them invisible to warm _ spitzer_. in fact , the progenitors may well resemble a moderately colder version of @xmath8  carina , which radiates most of its energy in the mid - ir and has an sed peaking at @xmath245 m ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature of such a distant shell will evolve slowly because the time scale for the expansion of the shell is now quite long . warm _",
    "spitzer _ will remain a valuable tool for identifying warm , inner shells , but a careful search for cold outer shells will need to wait for the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( _ jwst _ ) .",
    "the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ , @xcite ) , launched in december 2009 , is currently carrying out an all - sky survey at similar wavelengths to _ spitzer _ , as a natural by - product of its design , find many transients similar to sdwfs - mt-1 . with a @xmath19 sensitivity of @xmath221 mjy at 3.4   and @xmath246 mjy at 4.7  for a region with 8 exposures ( @xcite ) , _ wise _",
    "has far less sensitivity than the sdwfs survey . crudely speaking the survey volume compared to sdwfs scales as the ratio of the @xmath247 of the two surveys , so @xmath248 and the greater solid angle wins over the reduced sensitivity . if _",
    "wise _ completes two full years of observations it will also have 4 epochs , 1 epoch every 6 months , and so should detect a significant number of these mid - ir transients ( @xmath249 ) independent of their origin . for sources closer to the poles of the _ wise _ scan pattern , _ wise",
