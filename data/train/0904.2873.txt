    "the gauge / gravity duality is a powerful tool for understanding strongly coupled field theories and it has been applied extensively to a plethora of relativistic conformal field theories in various dimensions @xcite . in condensed matter physics there exist strongly coupled systems which respect the non - relativistic analog of the conformal group , known as the schrdinger group .",
    "recently it has been shown that one can realize certain gravity solutions which are invariant under the schrdinger group and thus extend the gauge / gravity duality to non - relativistic systems .",
    "this provides a new opportunity to apply holographic techniques to condensed matter systems .",
    "the celebrated example of gauge / gravity duality ( in its weak form ) is the equivalence between classical type iib supergravity in ads@xmath8 background and the large t hooft coupling limit of the planar @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "it has been further realized that this correspondence can be extended to a large class of deformations of @xmath0 sym which possess less global symmetry and supersymmetry .",
    "these include relevant deformations @xcite triggered by turning on certain mass terms for the adjoint scalars and the marginal @xmath3-deformations @xcite corresponding to deformation of the @xmath0 superpotential .",
    "it seems natural to look for non - relativistic cousins of these gravity solutions and this will be our goal in this note .",
    "gravity solutions invariant under the schrdinger group were first constructed in five dimensions @xcite and later embedded in ten dimensions by performing a null melvin twist on the familiar @xmath9 solution @xcite .",
    "the null melvin twist @xcite is a solution generating technique which can be applied to any solution of ten - dimensional supergravity with one compact and one non - compact @xmath10 isometries .",
    "it consists of performing a boost , t - duality , shift , t - duality and another boost .",
    "if the compact manifold has at least @xmath11 isometry ( which is the case of @xmath12 ) one can generalize this transformation by allowing three independent shifts along the three independent @xmath10 directions . using this",
    "we obtain the most general null melvin twist of the @xmath9 black hole solution .",
    "when all three shifts are set equal the background reduces to the one found in @xcite and at zero temperature the background is invariant under the full schrdinger group .",
    "we also exploit the null melvin twist to generate holographic duals to the non - relativistic version of @xmath0 sym deformed by relevant and marginal operators .",
    "there are two rg flows that have explicit ten - dimensional gravity duals .",
    "the solution of @xcite corresponds to an @xmath1 supersymmetric rg flow triggered by a mass term for one of the three complex chiral superfields of @xmath0 sym .",
    "this solution flows to an @xmath1 superconformal fixed point in the ir and the gravity dual of this conformal fixed point was originally found in @xcite .",
    "the other type iib background that we consider is dual to the @xmath2 supersymmetric rg flow induced by turning on masses for two of the chiral superfields of @xmath0 sym .",
    "the gravity dual of this flow was found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the infrared",
    "it does not flow to a fixed point , instead there is a particular distribution of d3 branes which is interpreted as the coulomb branch of the gauge theory .",
    "we also find the non - relativistic generalizations of the one parameter family of gravity solutions interpolating between the klebanov - witten(kw ) point @xcite and a @xmath13 orbifold of the pilch - warner(pw ) @xcite fixed point @xcite .",
    "finally we consider the non - relativistic cousin of the lunin - maldacena solution @xcite dual to the @xmath3-deformation of @xmath0 sym .",
    "all these solutions have at least one @xmath10 isometry on the compact manifold and we find their non - relativistic versions by applying the null melvin twist along this @xmath10 .",
    "an important general feature of the solutions of @xcite is the presence of internal ns and rr flux on the internal manifold .",
    "the null melvin twist preserves these fluxes and to the best of our knowledge the solutions in section 4 and section 7 are the first examples of gravity backgrounds with schrdinger isometry which have non - trivial internal flux .",
    "it is worth mentioning that an rg flow geometry which flows from a relativistic fixed point to a non - relativistic lifshitz - like fixed point has been constructed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the rg flow background discussed in section 3 interpolates between two vacua invariant under the schrdinger symmetry .    it should be noted that there is no known finite temperature version of the ten - dimensional @xmath1 and @xmath14 pw solutions , so we refrain from addressing finite temperature aspects of the geometries dual to the non - relativistic rg - flows pw solution in @xcite , however the explicit ten dimensional solution is not known . ] .",
    "the finite temperature lunin - maldacena solution is well known and we find its non - relativistic version by applying the null melvin twist",
    ". it will be interesting to analyze the thermodynamics of this background and understand how the marginal deformation affects certain transport coefficients in the dual field theory .",
    "we start in section 2 with a review of the schrdinger symmetry and its dual realization in type iib supergravity , we also construct the most general null melvin twist of @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce the pw background in section 3 and in section 4 show that the melvin twisted pw background possesses the schrdinger symmetry in the uv and the ir .",
    "section 5 contains the non - relativistic version of the family of fixed points interpolating between the @xmath13 orbifold of the pw fixed point and the kw fixed point . in section 6",
    "we discuss the non - relativistic version of the @xmath14 coulomb branch rg flow solution .",
    "we apply the null melvin twist to the lunin - maldacena background in section 7 and in section 8 we present some comments about the field theories dual to the geometries that we construct via the null melvin twist .",
    "section 9 contains some concluding remarks and open problems .",
    "various technical details are presented in the appendices .",
    "the schrdinger algebra in @xmath23-spatial dimensions can be obtained by the light cone reduction of the relativistic conformal algebra in @xmath26-spatial dimensions .",
    "this can be intuitively understood by noticing that the light cone reduction of the massless klein - gordon equation ( which is conformal ) gives the schrdinger equation in free space , we refer to @xcite for further details . here",
    "we will be interested in the case @xmath27 , i.e. non - relativistic field theories in @xmath28 dimensions .      in @xcite ,",
    "a corresponding five - dimensional gravitational background was constructed which possesses the schrdinger isometry group in two spatial dimensions .",
    "it was further realized in @xcite that it is possible to embed this geometry in ten dimensions .",
    "this can be done by applying a solution generating technique , the null melvin twist , to the well - known @xmath4 background ( in the poincare patch ) @xcite . here",
    "we will apply the most general null melvin twist and generalize the background found in @xcite .",
    "we start with the planar @xmath4 non - extremal black hole solution ( the radii of the @xmath29 and @xmath12 are equal to @xmath30 ) @xmath31 + \\ds\\frac{l^2}{r^2f(r ) } dr^2 + l^2\\ds\\sum_{i=1}^{3}(d\\mu_i^2+\\mu_i^2d\\varphi_i^2)~ , \\label{adsbhmet}\\ ] ] @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 the coordinates on @xmath12 are chosen such that the @xmath10 isometries along @xmath35 are the @xmath11 cartan subgroup of @xmath36 .",
    "now we can apply the null melvin twist to this background .",
    "the procedure is straightforward to implement and amounts to the following operations : first we boost in the @xmath37 plane with parameter @xmath38 , then we perform a t - duality along @xmath39 , then we shift all three cartan angles of @xmath12 by @xmath40 , then we perform another t - duality along @xmath39 and finally we perform an inverse boost in the @xmath37 plane with parameter @xmath41 and take the limit @xmath42 , @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "we also define @xmath45 .",
    "note that we are doing something a bit more general than the transformation in @xcite where the case @xmath46 was considered which corresponds to null melvin twist along the hopf fiber of @xmath12 .",
    "one can think of the third step of the null melvin twist as three simultaneous shifts in all three cartan directions ( or a tssst transformation for short @xcite ) .",
    "this general null melvin twist generates a metric of the form @xmath47+\\ds\\frac{l^2}{r^2f(r ) } dr^2 \\\\+ l^2\\ds\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left [ d\\mu_{i}^2 + \\mu_i^2d\\varphi_i^2\\right ] - \\ds\\frac{l^2r_{+}^4}{r^2k(r ) } \\left(\\ds\\sum_{i=1}^{3}l^2\\eta_i\\mu_i^2d\\varphi_i\\right)^2~ , \\label{general nmt met}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] as well as an ns two - form and a non - trivial dilaton given by @xmath48 where we have defined the function @xmath49 depends on @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for brevity we will denote it just by @xmath52 .",
    "] @xmath53 the self - dual five - form flux @xmath54 remains unaffected .",
    "this is the most general null melvin twist of the non - extremal d3 brane solution of which we can now take various limits .",
    "first let us consider the zero temperature ( extremal ) limit which amounts to setting @xmath55 .",
    "the background simplifies to @xmath56 where we have defined new coordinates @xmath57 the dynamical exponent of the solution , @xmath58 , parametrizes the different scaling of time and space in the dual non - relativistic theory and is determined by the @xmath59 term in the metric , @xmath60 .",
    "our solutions have @xmath61 , this is expected since only non - relativistic systems with @xmath61 admit the full schrdinger symmetry . indeed , following @xcite",
    ", one can verify that the background above has the full schrdinger symmetry .",
    "the generators of the schrdinger algebra are given by the following isometries of the metric ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) are infinitesimal parameters ) @xmath65 one can easily check that the zero temperature background above is invariant under these infinitesimal transformations .",
    "alternatively one can show that the five - dimensional non - compact metric has nine killing vectors and their lie brackets close under the schrdinger algebra",
    ". it should be possible to construct generalizations of the solution ( [ gennmtextreme ] ) with different dynamical exponents , @xmath66 , along the lines of @xcite , the field theories dual to such solutions will not be symmetric under special conformal transformations since these are present only for @xmath61 .",
    "it is interesting to consider also the case @xmath67 , then the extremal solution simplifies even further to @xmath68 where the metric on @xmath12 has been written as a hopf fiber over @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the left invariant @xmath71 one forms @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the khler form on @xmath69 .",
    "this is the type iib background constructed in @xcite and as we already emphasized it is a special case of the more general null melvin twist of @xmath4 given in ( [ general nmt met ] ) , ( [ general nmt fields ] ) .",
    "the galilean mass in the schrdinger algebra , @xmath21 , can be thought of as the number density in the non - relativistic field theory and is identified with the momentum along the compact @xmath74  direction ,  @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radius of the @xmath74 circle @xcite .",
    "the black hole solution after the twist has entropy , temperature and a chemical potential conjugate to @xmath77 .",
    "in addition to that we have the three deformation parameters @xmath78 representing the freedom to choose the twist parameters for the three possible @xmath10 isometries which are global symmetries in the dual field theory .",
    "the overall scale associated with these three twist parameters is related to the chemical potential . in the case",
    "in which all three @xmath78 vanish we have a dlcq of @xmath29 ( or @xmath79-bh ) corresponding to zero number density - i.e. , no particles in the non - relativistic theory  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the general null melvin twist is the appearance of the function  @xmath80 in front of @xmath81 . for generic values of @xmath78",
    "this function is positive definite and thus there are no singularities or causal pathologies @xcite .",
    "however for special choices of @xmath78 , @xmath80 may have zeroes .",
    "we have checked explicitly that the curvature of the ten dimensional solution is finite for all values of @xmath78 which implies that the zeroes of @xmath80 are not physical singularities and the ten dimensional solution is regular .",
    "functions which depend on the internal manifold do appear in the @xmath59 component of the metric in some of the solutions analyzed in @xcite , however in @xcite these are eigenfunctions of the laplacian on the internal manifold and thus necessarily change sign , which may lead to problems with stability and causality .",
    "the zero temperature background in equations ( [ adsbhmet ] ) , ( [ adsbhflux ] ) before the general null melvin twist has 32 killing spinors ( and thus 32 supercharges ) and one can show that for generic values of @xmath78 none of these killing spinors is preserved by the non - relativistic background given in equations ( [ general nmt met ] ) , ( [ general nmt fields ] ) .",

    "we can conclude that the field theory duals of the gravity solutions that we obtained via the null melvin twist can be obtained by applying the deformed dlcq procedure described above to the field theory dual to the gravity solution before the null melvin twist .",
    "in particular the solution discussed in section 4 is dual to the deformed dlcq of a mass deformation of @xmath0 sym where one gives mass to one of the chiral superfields .",
    "we find that the gravity dual suggests , much like its parent relativistic theory , that the non - relativistic theory flows to an ir fixed point after the massive field is integrated out , at this fixed point the field theory has dynamical exponent @xmath61 and is invariant under the schrdinger symmetry .",
    "the solution in section 7 is dual to a deformed dlcq of the @xmath3-deformation of @xmath0 sym discussed in @xcite , the non - relativistic field theory is again schrdinger invariant .",
    "the solution of section  6 is a bit more subtle since it does not flow to an ir fixed point .",
    "one can think of it in the following way - perform a deformed dlcq of @xmath0 sym and then give equal masses to two of the chiral superfields .",
    "the theory undergoes an rg flow similar to the rg flow of its parent relativistic theory , there is no ir fixed point and the theory flows to a coulomb branch .",
    "finally the solutions in section 5 should be dual to a family of non - relativistic ir fixed points with schrdinger symmetry , which can be obtained by a mass deformation of the deformed dlcq of the @xmath222 quiver gauge theory obtained by a @xmath13 orbifold of @xmath0 sym .",
    "note that in all cases we considered we have at least @xmath10 r - symmetry and we used exactly the corresponding isometry direction in the internal manifold for the null melvin twist .",
    "however in all cases the @xmath10 r - symmetry is a different @xmath10 subgroup of the @xmath36 r - symmetry of @xmath0 sym which will lead to a different definition of the star product ( [ starprod ] ) .",
    "note also that since we are discussing supergravity solutions , strictly speaking , they should be considered as duals to field theories at large @xmath207 .",
    "let us also comment on the meaning of the parameter @xmath228 . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the particle number density in the non - relativistic field theory is proportional to some power of  @xmath246 .",
    "however for the extremal gravity solutions ( i.e. @xmath247 ) this parameter can be set to unity by rescaling @xmath248 , @xmath249 . since the rg flow solutions considered here are only known for @xmath247 we can remove the dependence of the metric on @xmath228 , however we chose to keep @xmath228 explicit to emphasize that it has a physical meaning and can not be removed at finite temperature .",
    "we found the finite temperature non - relativistic lunin - maldacena solution and thus the dual field theory has two important parameters : the temperature @xmath250 and the particle number density which is related to @xmath228",
    ". it will be interesting to study the thermodynamics of this theory and see if the marginal deformation parameter @xmath3 affects any of the interesting thermodynamical quantities .",
    "for this finite temperature solution we can of course take the limit @xmath251 which will lead to the trivial case of zero particle number density in the dual field theory .",
    "in this note we found the non - relativistic generalizations of some known gravity solutions which are dual to rg flows and marginal deformations of @xmath0 sym .",
    "we found that when the original type iib background dual to the relativistic theory has an @xmath29 fixed point the non - relativistic geometry obtained after the null melvin twist has the schrdinger symmetry .",
    "this is quite a generic feature and it should persist for other @xmath252 compactifications with internal @xmath10 isometry to which one can apply the null melvin twist .",
    "another general feature of all backgrounds that we discussed is the existence of rr and ns internal fluxes . in particular after the null melvin twist the internal ns flux translates into off - diagonal , rotation - like , terms in the metric .",
    "more generally it will be interesting to understand if there is a consistent truncation of schrdinger invariant ten dimensional iib backgrounds with internal fluxes to five dimensions and if one can realize holographic rg flows directly in the five - dimensional gravitational theory",
    ".    it will be also quite interesting to look at the polchinski - strassler solution @xcite and see how much of its rich structure is present in its non - relativistic version .",
    "the exact gravity solution dual to this theory is not known so one can not straightforwardly apply the null melvin twist .",
    "there are certainly other known solutions of type iib and eleven - dimensional supergravity which are dual to rg flows of relativistic gauge theories @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to find their non - relativistic generalizations and understand the dual field theories .",
    "in particular the eleven - dimensional solution of @xcite realizes a holographic rg flow between @xmath253 in the uv and an @xmath254 compactification with fluxes in the ir , which is the eleven - dimensional analog of the solution in @xcite . it should be possible to find the non - relativistic version of this solution which should be dual to a non - relativistic conformal field theory in @xmath255 dimensions .    since one of the goals of extending gauge / gravity duality to non - relativistic field theories",
    "is to be able to gain some understanding of these theories at strong coupling and finite temperature , it will be quite interesting to construct the finite temperature cousins of the non - relativistic rg flows that were discussed here pw rg flow at finite temperature . ] .",
    "this will be a rather non - trivial task and maybe one has to look for approximate solutions and extract the interesting physics from them .",
    "the general null melvin twist discussed in section 2 relies on the @xmath256 subgroup of the @xmath36 isometry group of @xmath12 .",
    "one can use this to generate a large class of non - relativistic type iib backgrounds by applying the null melvin twist to solutions of the form @xmath257 where @xmath258 are the five - dimensional sasaki - einstein manifolds constructed in @xcite .",
    "these manifolds have @xmath256 isometry and are a generalization of the @xmath259 sasaki - einstein manifolds found in @xcite . for generic values of @xmath260",
    "we expect that these non - relativistic solutions will break supersymmetry completely , but there might be special choices of @xmath260 for which some killing spinors are preserved @xcite .",
