    "the value of @xmath9 is given by the formula : @xmath10,$ ] where @xmath11 is gamma function while @xmath12 is the upper incomplete gamma function .",
    "the @xmath13 $ ] is expectation taken with respect to interferers channel distribution @xmath14 .",
    "the integral @xmath15 does not have closed - form expression for arbitrary values of @xmath4 .",
    "for special cases : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the q - function .    in practice , the value of @xmath4 can range anywhere from 1.6 to 6.5 , depending on the environment .",
    "the path - loss exponent for outdoor urban area is around 3.7 to 6.5 ; while for indoor single floor office buildings , it is around 1.6 to 3.5 ; for home environment , it is 3 ; whereas for stores , it can be from 1.8 to 2.2 @xcite .",
    "( [ eqn : coverage ] ) can be directly evaluated by numerical integration techniques , but qualitative insight is lost in this process .",
    "this can instead be replaced by approximations , which allows sufficiently accurate quantitative predictions , while at the same time offers qualitative insight into the relationship between various parameters .",
    "thus , the motivation of this letter is to find simple expressions that allow us to approximate the value of coverage probability for these diverse path - loss exponents .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate a few approximations related to the integral ( [ eqn : coverage ] ) and discuss their convergence properties . while we focus on cases when @xmath18 , much of the analysis carries over to cases when @xmath19 as well .",
    "there can be two limiting cases for the integral ( [ eqn : coverage ] ) : when @xmath20 and when @xmath21 .",
    "although the solutions for these two cases are trivial , they have important physical significance .",
    "physically , @xmath22 can occur when the bs intensity @xmath23 and hence the term @xmath24 in the integral can be neglected .",
    "this is referred to as the noise - limited case .",
    "similarly , @xmath21 can occur when @xmath25 , so that the term @xmath26 can be neglected .",
    "this is referred to as the interference - limited case .",
    "these cases can also be used as initial approximations when @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "for these two cases , the integral ( [ eqn : coverage ] ) assumes simple closed form solutions : @xmath29    to evaluate the integral for the case when @xmath22 , we have used the fact that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( * ? ? ?",

    "we will use this formula frequently in the rest of the letter .",
    "the simplicity of these expressions inspires the following simple , closed form of limiting approximation for the cases when both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are non - zero : @xmath36^{-1}. \\label{eqn : limiting - approx}\\ ] ] we see that ( [ eqn : limiting - approx ] ) reduces to one of the cases given in ( [ eqn : limit - a - zero ] ) or ( [ eqn : limit - b - zero ] ) as @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively , and is exact for @xmath39 .",
    "the formula can be used when @xmath34 and @xmath35 are comparable to each other , but at the expense of accuracy .      for the case when both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are positive",
    ", one possible strategy of arriving at an integral approximation is to expand one of the exponential terms as @xmath41 where the lagrange form of the remainder is @xmath42 such that @xmath43 . since @xmath44",
    ", absolute value of @xmath45 can be upper bounded by @xmath46    if we expand the term @xmath47 appearing in ( [ eqn : coverage ] ) and integrate term wise , we obtain @xmath48 where the remainder term @xmath49 .",
    "neglecting the remainder term @xmath50 gives us our first approximation @xmath51    eq . ( [ eqn : first - approx - series ] ) reduces to ( [ eqn : limit - b - zero ] ) when @xmath52 , as such it is a refinement of ( [ eqn : limit - b - zero ] ) .",
    "the authors in @xcite arrived at the first two terms of the series ( [ eqn : first - approx - series ] ) using integration by parts ; but they did not elaborate on its validity . if we take infinite number of terms , the series ( [ eqn : first - approx - series ] ) is not convergent for @xmath18 for arbitrary values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see * appendix a * ) .",
    "nevertheless , this form of approximation is appropriate when @xmath40 . to quantify the region",
    "in which this approximation is valid , we first upper bound the remainder term in ( [ eqn : first - approx ] ) as @xmath53 the second inequality is from ( [ eqn : lagrange - bound ] ) where @xmath54 .",
    "if we take @xmath55 terms of the approximating series , then for any given error tolerance @xmath56 , we require that the integral error be @xmath57 . using the upper bound for @xmath58 in this expression , we obtain the bound for @xmath35 in terms of @xmath34 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 . substituting the expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in ( [ eqn : bound-1 ] ) , we get @xmath61 thus , we obtain the largest noise variance above which the error of approximation becomes unacceptable for given number of terms @xmath55 and error tolerance @xmath62 .    however , it is not obvious as to what happens as @xmath55 is increased to infinity . for this",
    ", we have the limit @xmath63 hence , for @xmath18 , we have the limit @xmath64 therefore , we have the following largest value of @xmath8 as @xmath65 below which the approximation will be valid for any given @xmath62 .      in the integral ( [ eqn : coverage ] ) ,",
    "if we consider expanding the term @xmath67 instead and perform term wise integration , we get @xmath68 where the remainder term @xmath69 . as before , if we neglect the remainder term @xmath50 , we obtain our second approximation as @xmath70 eq . ( [ eqn : second - approx - series ] ) reduces to ( [ eqn : limit - a - zero ] ) when @xmath52 , as such it is a refinement of ( [ eqn : limit - a - zero ] ) .    the remainder term in ( [ eqn : second - approx ] ) can be bounded as @xmath71 the second inequality is from ( [ eqn : lagrange - bound ] ) where @xmath72 .",
    "this form of approximation is suitable for cases when @xmath27 . to find the precise region for which this approximation is valid , consider again an error tolerance of @xmath56 and @xmath55 terms of the approximating series . since we require that the integral error be bounded by the error tolerance , @xmath57 , this leads us to a bound for @xmath35 in terms of @xmath34 as @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "substituting the expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 gives us the smallest value of noise variance @xmath75 below which the error becomes unacceptably large .",
    "as in previous case , as @xmath55 tends to infinity , we have @xmath76 hence for @xmath18 , we have @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the smallest value of @xmath8 above which the approximation will be valid for any @xmath62 is @xmath78 this result implies that the infinite series for ( [ eqn : second - approx - series ] ) is convergent when @xmath18 .",
    "this is indeed the case ( see * appendix b * ) .      here",
    ", we would like to find an approximation for the case when @xmath34 and @xmath35 are comparable to each other , that is , when the system is neither noise limited nor interference limited .",
    "we will try to obtain an approximation using laplace s method .",
    "let @xmath79 .",
    "the unique global minima of @xmath80 is at @xmath81 , which is where this method is usually applied @xcite .",
    "if we take the first order taylor expansion of @xmath80 about @xmath81 , then it will merely result in the approximation @xmath82 .",
    "thus , it can be advantageous to consider a point other than the global minima for the taylor expansion .",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath80 about @xmath83 is @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the remainder term in lagrange form is @xmath86 where @xmath87 for some @xmath88 .",
    "changing the variable in ( [ eqn : coverage ] ) from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , we obtain @xmath91    let @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ; completing the square , we get @xmath95    now , let @xmath96 , and expanding its exponent , we have @xmath97 , where @xmath98 such that @xmath99 . its absolute value can be upper bounded as @xmath100 . thus the right integral",
    "can be split as @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the q - function of @xmath104 .",
    "the remainder term is @xmath105 .",
    "if we neglect this remainder term , then we obtain our required approximation as @xmath106 the expression is exact when @xmath107 .",
    "unlike the previous two approximations , here the accuracy of approximation in general depends on the value of @xmath108 chosen .",
    "we can bound the remainder term as @xmath109 the last step follows as such : since the function to be integrated is non - negative , @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath18 and @xmath111 , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; hence @xmath112 , and therefore , the maxima of @xmath113 occurs in negative axis .",
    "so @xmath114 , where the last equality follows by changing the variable from @xmath90 to @xmath115 .",
    "we have @xmath116 . when @xmath117 , @xmath118 is monotonically decreasing and its maximum value is attained at @xmath119 .",
    "putting @xmath120 , we have @xmath121    putting @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the lower incomplete gamma function .",
    "empirical considerations have led us to choose @xmath126 .",
    "note that the form of this value is similar to the limiting approximation .",
    ". , width=264 ]     changes.,width=264 ]    here we compare the four approximations to integral ( [ eqn : coverage ] ) with its value obtained via numerical integration . since both parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on @xmath127 and @xmath6 ,",
    "we maintain them both at @xmath128 db .",
    "we assume @xmath129 , i.e. , one bs on average per circular area of radius 500 meters .",
    "we only vary @xmath8 .",
    "the interferer s channel distribution @xmath14 is assumed to be exponential with mean @xmath7 .",
    "1 plots the change in absolute error and coverage probability as snr = @xmath130 changes for @xmath131 .",
    "for both the interference - limited and noise - limited cases , we take the summation up to four terms from ( [ eqn : first - approx - series ] ) and ( [ eqn : second - approx - series ] ) , respectively . for the interference - limited case ( [ eqn : second - approx - series ] ) , the error is near zero only for snr greater than certain value .",
    "likewise , for the noise - limited case ( [ eqn : first - approx - series ] ) , the error is near zero only for snr smaller than some value . for intermediate case",
    ", the laplace approximation gives an error less than 0.005 .",
    "fig . 2 plots",
    "the maximum absolute error for the limiting and laplace approximations . in general , the error amplitude tends to increase with @xmath4 , except for @xmath132 where the error is zero for laplace .",
    "the error amplitude decreases as @xmath6 increases , while it remain unchanged when @xmath5 or @xmath127 is changed .",
    "this is because when @xmath5 is increased , the system becomes interference limited at higher noise variance @xmath8 ( i.e. , at lower snr ) .",
    "thus the coverage probability curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha3 ] shifts to the left .",
    "this shift is quantitatively given by ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "however , the maximum coverage probability , given by @xmath133 , which occurs when @xmath25 ( and thus @xmath134 at high snr ) , remains unchanged .",
    "similarly , since the transmit powers of all the bss are assumed to be equal in @xcite , changing the value of transmit power is equivalent to scaling the noise variance @xmath8 by @xmath127 in the sinr expression .",
    "thus , the plot of the coverage probability versus the @xmath8 in db results in shifting of the curves towards the left as @xmath127 is increased , without changing its shape or amplitude .",
    "since the coverage probability curve has only shifted and not changed its shape , the maximum error which occurs around the edge of the plateau of the coverage probability will also remain unchanged .",
    "we have examined four different ways of approximating the coverage integral .",
    "the limiting approximation is useful as an initial rough approximation .",
    "we can use the approximation for interference - limited case or the noise - limited case so long as the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfy some inequality relationship . for intermediate cases ,",
    "we recommend the use of laplace approximation .      to check the convergence of the series ( [ eqn : first - approx - series ] )",
    "we will apply the ratio test : @xmath135 converges if @xmath136 . for our case , @xmath137 using the identity @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 using the identity : @xmath140 , we obtain @xmath141 for large @xmath89 and fixed @xmath90 , @xmath142 , so we have @xmath143 therefore , we finally have @xmath144                  h.s .",
