    "for the first decade of microlens planet detections , beginning with ogle-2003-blg-235 lb @xcite , the great majority of detections required a combination of survey and followup data .",
    "this is a consequence of two effects .",
    "first , the survey coverage was generally too sparse to characterize the planetary anomalies in the detected events @xcite .",
    "second , thanks to aggressive alert capability , pioneered by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) early warning system ( ews , @xcite ) , it became possible to organize intensive followup of planet - sensitive events  or even ongoing planetary anomalies  and so obtain sufficient time resolution to detect and characterize the planets .",
    "however , as surveys have become more powerful over the past decade , they have become increasingly capable of detecting planets without follow up observations .",
    "that is , making use of larger cameras , the surveys are able to monitor fairly wide areas at cadences of up to several times per hour .",
    "while still substantially lower than follow - up observations of the handful of events that were monitored by follow - up groups , this is still adequate to detect most planets ( provided that the anomalies occur when the survey is observing ) . very simple reasoning given below , which is supported by detailed simulations",
    "@xcite , leads one to expect that the transition from survey+followup to survey - only mode implies a corresponding transition from planets detected primarily in high - magnification events via central and resonant caustics to planets primarily detected in lower magnification events via planetary caustics .",
    "high - magnification events are intrinsically sensitive to planets because they probe the so - called `` central caustic '' that lies close to ( or overlays ) the position of the host @xcite .",
    "planets that are separated from the hosts by substantially more ( less ) than the einstein radius generate one ( two ) other caustics that are typically much larger than the central caustic and thus have a higher cross section for anomalous deviations from a point - lens light curve due to a random source trajectory .",
    "however , for high - magnification events , the source is by definition passing close to the host and hence close to or over the central caustic . for planet - host separations that are comparable to the einstein radius ,",
    "the two sets of caustics merge into a single ( and larger ) `` resonant caustic '' , which is even more likely to generate anomalous deviations of a high - magnification event .    for many years",
    ", the microlensing follow up network ( @xmath3fun ) employed a strategy based on this high planet sensitivity of high - magnification events .",
    "they made detailed analyses of alerts of ongoing events from the ogle and the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) teams to predict high - magnification events and then mobilized followup observations over the predicted peak .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath3fun was able to get substantial data over peak for about 50% of all identified events with maximum magnification @xmath4 , but that its success rate dropped off dramatically at lower magnification , i.e. , even for @xmath5 .",
    "the reason for this drop off was fundamentally limited observing resources : there are twice as many events @xmath6 compared to @xmath4 , and monitoring the full - width half - maximum requires twice as much observing time .",
    "hence , observations grow quadratically with effective magnification cutoff .    by contrast , because planetary caustics are typically much larger than central caustics , most planets detected in survey - only mode are expected to be from anomalies generated by the former , which occur primarily in garden - variety ( rather than high - mag ) events @xcite . for example , @xcite detected a large planetary caustic in ogle-2012-blg-0406 based purely upon ogle data , while @xcite detected one in moa - bin-1 based mostly on moa data . in the latter case",
    "it would have been completely impossible to discover the planet by survey+followup mode because the `` primary event '' ( due to the host ) was so weak that it was never detected in the data .",
    "nevertheless , there has been a steady stream of survey - only detections of planets in high - magnification events as well .",
    "the first of these was moa-2007-blg-192 lb , a magnification @xmath7 event , which required a combination of moa and ogle data @xcite .",
    "the first planet detected by combining three surveys ( moa , ogle , wise ) , moa-2011-blg-322 lb , was also via a central caustic , although in this case the caustic was very large so that the magnification did not have to be extremely large @xmath8 @xcite . similarly , @xcite detected a large central caustic due to the large planet ogle-2015-blg-0954 lb despite modest peak magnification of the underlying event @xmath9 .",
    "this case was notable because high - cadence data from the korea microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet ) captured the caustic entrance despite the extremely short source self - crossing time , @xmath10min .",
    "kmtnet is still in the process of testing its reduction pipeline .",
    "motivated by the above experience , the kmtnet team focused its tests on high - magnification events identified as such on the ogle web page .",
    "in addition to exposing the reduction algorithms to a wide range of brightnesses , this testing has the added advantage that there is a high probability to find planets . here",
    "we report on the first planet found by these tests from among the first seven high - mag events that were examined : ogle-2016-blg-(0261,0353,0471,0528,0572,0596,0612 ) .",
    "these events were chosen to have model point - lens magnifications @xmath11 and modeled peak times @xmath12 .",
    "the lower limit was set by the beginning of the kmtnet observing season and the upper limit was the time of the last ogle update when the seven events were selected .",
    "on 2016 april 8 ut 12:15 ( hjd@xmath13 hjd@xmath14 ) , ogle alerted the community to a new microlensing event ogle-2016-blg-0596 based on observations with the 1.4 deg@xmath15 camera on its 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile @xcite using its ews real - time event detection software @xcite .",
    "most observations were in @xmath16 band , but with some @xmath17 band observations that are , in general , taken for source characterization .",
    "these @xmath17-band data are not used in the modeling . at equatorial coordinates ( 17:51:12.81 , @xmath18:50:59.4 ) and galactic coordinates @xmath19",
    ", this event lies in ogle field blg534 , with an observing cadence during the period of the anomaly of roughly 0.4 per hour .",
    "kmtnet employs three @xmath20 cameras mounted on 1.6 m telescopes at ctio / chile , saao / south africa , and sso / australia @xcite . in 2015",
    "kmtnet had concentrated observations on 4 fields . however , in 2016 , this strategy was radically modified to cover ( 12 , 40 , 80 ) @xmath21 at cadences of @xmath22 . for the three highest - cadence fields ,",
    "kmtnet observations are alternately offset by about @xmath23 in order to ensure coverage of events in gaps between chips . as a result",
    ", ogle-2016-blg-0596 lies in two slightly offset fields blg01 and blg41 , which are each observed at a cadence 2 per hour .",
    "kmtnet observes primarily in @xmath16 band , but 1/11 observations from ctio and 1/21 observations from saao are in @xmath17-band .",
    "reductions of the primary data were made using difference image analysis ( dia ) @xcite .",
    "however , due to issues discussed in section 3 , special variants of dia were developed specifically for this event .",
    "see below .",
    "kmt ctio @xmath17 and @xmath16 images were , in addition , reduced using dophot @xcite , solely for the purpose of determining the source color .",
    "the ogle-2016-blg-0596 light curve shows clear variability over the course of 6 seasons of ogle - iv data prior to 2016 . this variability is roughly consistent with being sinusoidal at period @xmath24 days .",
    "see figure  [ fig : one ] . while the semi - amplitude of the variability is only @xmath25 of the baseline flux @xmath26 , this semi - amplitude turns out to be roughly equal to the source flux derived from the model .      assuming ( as proves to be the case ) that it is not the source itself that is variable , such low level variability can not significantly impact characterization of the anomalous features of the lightcurve because they are at relatively high magnification and take place on much shorter timescales .",
    "however , if not properly accounted for , such variability can seriously impact the estimate of the source flux and , as a direct consequence of this , the einstein timescale @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the angular einstein radius , @xmath29 is the lens - source relative parallax , and @xmath3 is the lens - source relative proper motion in the earth frame .",
    "errors in these quantities would propagate into the estimates of the planet - star mass ratio @xmath30 , the einstein radius @xmath28 , and the proper motion @xmath3 , all of which are important for assessing the physical implications of the detection .",
    "the reason that @xmath31 is potentially impacted by unmodeled variability is that it is determined primarily from the wings of the light curve where the amplitude of the amplification of flux is comparable to that of the variability .",
    "hence , it is important to track down the source of this variability and correct for it to the extent possible .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .      in principle , tracking down such a low level of variability in such a crowded field could have been very difficult .",
    "however , in the present case , it turns out to be due to a star @xmath32 to the southeast , which is quite bright @xmath33 and shows variability with the same period and phase . within the framework of standard dia",
    ", it is natural that this variable should impact the microlensing light curve because the difference image contains residuals from the variable that overlap the point spread function ( psf ) of the microlensed star .",
    "hence , when the difference image is dot - multiplied by the psf to estimate the flux , it includes a contribution from the residual flux of the variable .",
    "it is straightforward to simultaneously fit for two ( or @xmath34 ) variables with possibly overlapping psfs . after constructing difference images in the standard way ,",
    "one simply generalizes the normal procedure by calculating the @xmath34 flux - difference values @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 is the ( unit normalized : @xmath38 ) amplitude of the @xmath39th psf in the @xmath40th pixel and @xmath41 are the value and error of the difference flux in the @xmath40th pixel .",
    "we use a variant of this formalism to reduce the ogle data with @xmath42 stars , including the microlensed source , the bright variable , and one other very nearby ( but non - variable ) blended star .",
    "the result is shown in the second panel of figure  [ fig : one ] .",
    "first note that the fluxes have decreased by about 0.5 mag because the non - variable neighboring blend ( third star in the fit ) has been removed from the baseline flux .",
    "the semi - periodic variations are removed",
    ". however there remains an annual trend .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : one ] shows that this annual trend is due to variations with sidereal time , almost certainly due to the impact of the bright red neighbor ( even if it were constant ) via differential refraction .",
    "we fit this variation to polynomials of order @xmath34 , but find that there is no significant improvement beyond @xmath43 , for which @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is flux in units of @xmath46 .",
    "note that the variation from 0.3 to 0.7 ( on the figure ) is @xmath47 which is 1.5 times larger than the source flux derived below .",
    "the third panel shows the results of applying this sidereal - time correction . as expected the annual trend",
    "we apply this flux correction to all data , not just the baseline data shown in this figure .",
    "we find ( as expected ) that this corrects the slope of the rising part of the light curve , which indeed impacts the estimate of @xmath31 , though by less than 10% .",
    "note that while , in most cases , it is possible to derive an accurate estimate of the photometric error bars from those reported by the photometric pipeline @xcite , in this case we did not apply this simple prescription because the data were reduced using a special customized pipeline .",
    "we apply the same formalism given by equations  ( [ eqn : multifit1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : multifit2 ] ) to the kmtnet data , but with only two stars , i.e. , the microlensed source and the neighboring variable .",
    "note that this difference between ogle and kmtnet reductions plays no role in the final result because the third star incorporated into the ogle fit is not variable , and the kmtnet flux scale is ultimately aligned to ogle through the microlens fit .",
    "thus , in particular , we retain the advantage of resolving out this blend , thus placing better limits on flux from the lens .",
    "the formalism introduced in section 3.3 can also be used to gain intuition about the impact of uncorrected variability , which can then be used to assess whether such corrections are necessary in specific cases .",
    "first note that for @xmath43 , equations  ( [ eqn : multifit1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : multifit2 ] ) reduce to the standard formula : @xmath48    equation  ( [ eqn : singlefit ] ) then allows us to express the properly corrected `` true '' photometry in terms of the `` naive '' single - source photometry that ignores neighbors .",
    "we first `` infer '' the value , @xmath49 , which then yields , @xmath50    hence , the correction is governed by the ratio of the psf overlap integral @xmath51 to the integral of the psf squared , @xmath52 .",
    "we can evaluate this explicitly for the special case of a gaussian psf and below - sky sources ( @xmath53const ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the separation between the two sources . if the two sources are reasonably well separated , @xmath56fwhm , and ( as in the present case ) the target ( 1 ) is below sky while the contaminating variable ( 2 ) is well above sky , then the effect is roughly half of that given by equation  ( [ eqn : gaussbelow ] ) .",
    "this is because the squared psf integral is basically unaffected while the half of the contribution to the overlap integral that is closer to the contaminant is heavily suppressed by the higher flux errors per pixel .",
    "we close by re - emphasizing that these order - or - magnitude estimates are not used in the present analysis but are intended as guidance for future cases .",
    "the lightcurve has two principal features : a strong caustic entrance near peak at hjd@xmath57 and a weak caustic exit at hjd@xmath58 .",
    "apart from these caustic crossings , the morphology is that of a slightly distorted point - lens event .",
    "this morphology points to a binary lens with very unequal mass ratio @xmath59 , i.e. , in the brown - dwarf or planetary regime .",
    "the long duration of the caustic ( 16 days ) then points to a resonant caustic , and so projected separation ( in units of @xmath28 ) of @xmath60 .",
    "a thorough search of the parameter space leads to only one viable solution , which confirms the above naive reasoning ( so , before the caustic exit ) already led to essentially this same solution ( although the predicted caustic exit was 2.6 days later than the one subsequently observed ) . ] .",
    "the model is described by seven parameters .",
    "these include three that are analogous to a point - lens event @xmath61 , i.e. , the time of closest approach to the center of magnification , the impact parameter normalized to @xmath28 and the einstein crossing time ; three to describe the binary companion @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the angle of binary axis relative to the source trajectory ; and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the angular radius of the source .",

    "the light curve and model are shown in figure  [ fig : two ] , while the lens geometry is shown in figure  [ fig : three ] .",
    "we note that compared to other planetary and binary events with well - covered caustic crossings , the parameter @xmath73 ( and the parameter combination @xmath74 ) have relatively large errors .",
    "these parameters are usually better measured because caustic crossings tend to be bright ( since the caustic itself is a contour of formally infinite magnification ) , which means that the photometry over the caustic crossing is relatively precise .",
    "since @xmath75 depends almost entirely on the duration of this crossing , with only weak dependence on other model parameters , it can then be determined quite precisely .    in the present case , however , the first crossing",
    "was entirely missed simply because it was not visible from any of the five survey telescopes currently in operation ( ogle , moa , and three from kmtnet : ctio , saao , sso ) .",
    "the caustic exit was captured by kmtnet saao , with 12 points taken over 3.63 hours ( i.e. , 20 minute cadence ) . however , since this caustic was quite weak , peaking at @xmath76 , the photometry has much larger errors than the saao photometry near peak .",
    "see upper two panels of figure  [ fig : two ] .    adopting a more glass - half - full orientation , we should assess the prior probability that either of the two caustic crossings would have been adequately observed to measure @xmath70 .",
    "considering the 20 days between hjd@xmath77 7485 and 7505 , the three kmtnet observatories each took at least two points on 13 nights , with total durations , ( 2.11,2.76,2.52 ) days for sso , saao , and ctio , i.e. , a total 7.39 days .",
    "essentially all of these 39 intervals had approximately continuous coverage .",
    "we estimate that the probability that @xmath70 can be measured is the same as the probability that the caustic peak is covered , which may be slightly too conservative . under this assumption ,",
    "the probability that the caustics would be observed are each 37% , so that the probability that at least one would be observed is @xmath78 .",
    "of course , since the midpoint of the two caustic crossings was 16 april , this probability is adversely affected by the shortness of the bulge observing window relative to microlensing `` high season '' ( 21 may ",
    "21 july ) . at that time",
    "the observing window is roughly 2.5 hours longer , and so ( assuming comparable weather conditions ) , the probability for each crossing would be 52% and the probability for at least one would be 77% .",
    "nevertheless , the mid - april values may be considered as a proxy for the microlensing season as a whole .",
    "we use kmtnet ctio dophot reductions to construct an instrumental color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) that is presented in figure  [ fig : four ] .",
    "we find the instrumental source color from model - independent regression and the instrumental source magnitude by fitting the @xmath16 band light curve to the model .",
    "we then find the offset from the clump @xmath79=(-0.23,4.06)\\pm ( 0.03,0.10)$ ] , where the error in the color offset is dominated by the regression measurement while the error in the magnitude offset is dominated by fitting for the clump centroid .",
    "we then adopt @xmath80_{0,\\rm clump}=(1.06,14.49)$ ] @xcite to obtain @xmath80_{0,s}=(0.83,18.55)$ ] . then using standard techniques @xcite",
    ", we convert from @xmath81 to @xmath82 using the @xcite @xmath83 color - color relations and then use the @xcite color / surface - brightness relations to derive @xmath84 the error in @xmath65 is dominated by the uncertainties in transforming from color to surface brightness ( 8% ) , with a significant contribution from the error in @xmath71 ( 5% ) .",
    "the fractional errors in @xmath28 and @xmath3 are substantially larger than in @xmath65 due to the relatively large error in @xmath70 .",
    "see section 4 .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath28 almost certainly implies that the lens lies in the galactic disk since the lens - source relative parallax is @xmath85 that is , only if the lens were substantially heavier than @xmath86 could it be in the bulge ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "however , first , there are almost no such massive stars in the bulge and second , its light would then exceed the blended light @xmath88 , even allowing for the @xmath89 extinction toward this line of sight @xcite . the only exception to this line of reasoning",
    "would be if the lens were a black hole .",
    "the most notable characteristic of ogle-2016-blg-0596 is its high mass ratio @xmath90 , implying that the mass is @xmath91 .",
    "hence , if the host is one solar mass , this planet would be just below the the deuterium - burning limit ( usually regarded as the planet / brown - dwarf boundary ) . while the host could in principle have arbitrarily low mass ( and so , by equation  ( [ eqn : mpirel ] ) , be arbitrarily close ) , distances closer than @xmath92 are strongly disfavored by the relatively low proper motion as well as the paucity of nearby lenses . at this limiting distance , and so @xmath93",
    ", the planet would still be @xmath94 , i.e. , quite massive for such a low - mass host .",
    "hence , regardless of the host mass , this is a fairly extreme system .    to distinguish among these interesting possibilities",
    "will require measuring ( or strongly constraining ) the host mass .",
    "this can be accomplished with high resolution imaging , either using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ or ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging on an 8 m class telescope .",
    "an advantage of _ hst _ is that it can observe in the @xmath16 band for which the source flux is directly measured from the event .",
    "hence , the source light can be most reliably separated from the blended light in @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast to many previous cases , there are no @xmath95 band observations during the event , so ground - based ao observations ( which must be in the infrared ) can not be directly compared to an event - derived source flux .",
    "nevertheless , it is probably possible to transform from @xmath81 light - curve measurement to @xmath96 source flux with a precision of 0.2 mag , using a @xmath97 color - color diagram .    for definiteness",
    ", we will assume that the lens can be reliably detected from _",
    "hst _ or ao observations provided that the flux is at least half that of the source , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "for example , if the lens were an @xmath99 middle m dwarf ( so @xmath100 ) , then it would have @xmath101 ( and brighter if , as is almost certainly the case , a substantial fraction of the dust is beyond 1.3 kpc ) .",
    "thus , there is a good chance that ao or _",
    "_ observations could detect the lens , and even if this failed , the observations would strongly constrain the host to be of very low mass .",
    "ogle-2016-blg-0596 lb is a very high mass - ratio @xmath102 planet that lies projected very close to the einstein ring @xmath103 , which consequently generated a huge resonant caustic that required 16 days for the source to traverse .",
    "the underlying event was of quite high magnification @xmath104 , which led to pronounced features at peak .",
    "it therefore would seem to be extremely easy to discover .",
    "while the data set posted on the ogle web site are adversely affected by the nearby variable , it is still the case that a free fit to these data leads to a solution qualitatively similar to the one presented here ( except that it lacks a measurement of @xmath70 ) .",
    "it is therefore striking that none of the automated programs nor active individual investigators that query this site noticed this event ( or at least they did not alert the community to what they found as they do for a wide range of other events , many less interesting ) .",
    "this suggests that there may be many other planets `` hidden in plain sight '' in existing data .",
    "these three characteristics , high - magnification ( which is usually associated with survey+followup rather than survey - only mode ) , very high mass ratio , and apparent failure of both machine and by - eye recognition of the planetary perturbation , prompt us to address two questions . first , how do the real ( as opposed to theoretical ) planet sensitivities differ between survey - only and survey+followup modes .",
    "second , why was this planet discovered only based on systematic analysis and what does this imply about the need for such systematic analysis of all events ?",
    "[ [ summary - of - microlens - planet - detections - in - the - observational - sq - plane ] ] summary of microlens planet detections in the observational @xmath1 plane ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    many papers contain figures that summarize microlensing planet detections in the physical plane of planet - mass versus projected separation ( with the latter sometimes normalized by the snow line ) , e.g. , figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "and there are many studies that show plots of _ planet sensitivity _ in the observational @xmath1 plane , ( e.g. , @xcite ) . but to our knowledge ,",
    "there are no published figures ( or even figures shown at conferences ) showing the census of microlensing planet discoveries on this plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : five ] illustrates the position of ogle-2016-blg-0596 ( green pentagon ) among the 44 previously published planets ( or , to the extent we have such knowledge , submitted for publication ) .",
    "discovered bodies are defined to be `` planets '' if their measured or best - estimated mass @xmath105 and if they are known to orbit a more massive body .",
    "planets are color - coded by discovery method : discovered by followup observations ( black ) , discovered ( or discoverable ) in survey - only observations but requiring followup for full - characterization ( magenta ) , fully ( or essentially fully ) characterized by survey observations ( green ) .",
    "the shapes of the symbols indicate the type of caustic that gave rise to the planetary perturbation : circles , squares , and triangles for planetary , central , and resonant caustics , respectively . in many cases , solutions with @xmath106 and @xmath107 yield almost equally good fits to the data @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the two solutions are shown as open symbols in order to diminish their individual visual `` weight '' relative to the filled symbols used when this degeneracy is broken . hence , ogle-2016-blg-0596 lb would be a green filled triangle if it were not being singled out by making it larger pentagon .",
    "the most striking feature of this figure is that , in sharp contrast to the triangular appearance of high - magnification - event planet - sensitivity plots ( e.g. , @xcite ) and to `` double pronged '' low - magnification sensitivity plots ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this detection plot looks basically like a cross , with a vertical band of detections near @xmath108 and a horizontal band near @xmath109 .",
    "the part of this structure at high mass ratio @xmath110 is easily explained : companions with high mass ratio are , a priori , most likely stars or brown dwarfs ( bds ) and can only be claimed as `` planets '' if the host mass is known to be low .",
    "this in turn usually requires a measurement of the microlens parallax , which for ground based observations is much more likely if there is a large caustic and so @xmath60 .",
    "however , the absence of detections @xmath111 is puzzling .",
    "there are 4 such detections on the opposite side @xmath112 .",
    "all of these derive from planetary caustics and three of them are pure survey detections moa-2011-blg-028 lb , ogle-2008-blg-092 lb , and moa-2013-blg-605 lb @xcite .",
    "the remaining planet , ogle-2005-blg-390 lb @xcite , dates from an era when follow - up groups intensively monitored the wings of events , primarily due to the paucity of better targets .",
    "thus we may expect that surveys will gradually fill in this quadrant .    apart from this quadrant , it is not obvious that surveys are probing a different part of parameter space from the previously dominant survey+followup mode . to further investigate this ,",
    "we show in figures  [ fig : six ] and [ fig : seven ] the cumulative distributions of planets by log mass ratio @xmath113 and ( absolute value of ) log separation @xmath114 . in this case",
    "we distinguish only between events that could be fully characterized by survey observations ( green ) and those that required significant followup ( including auto - followup by surveys ) .",
    "these distributions generally appear quite similar . for the mass ratio distribution , the greatest difference ( 0.259 )",
    "is at @xmath115 , which is very typical ( kolmogorov - smirnoff ( ks ) probability 40% ) .",
    "the greatest difference for the separation distribution ( 0.334 at @xmath116 ) has a ks probability of 8.5% .",
    "this may be indicative of a real difference .",
    "if so , the difference would be that pure - survey is relatively more efficient at finding widely separated lenses , which was already hinted at by inspection of the @xmath106 scatter plot .    finally ,",
    "in figure  [ fig : eight ] , we show cumulative distributions by year of discovery",
    ". one might expect that with the massive ramp - up of surveys , survey - only discoveries would move strongly ahead of survey+followup .",
    "this expectation is confirmed in its sign but not its magnitude by figure  [ fig : eight ] .",
    "it shows that in ( 2014 , 2015 , 2016 ) there have been ( 2,2,1 ) and ( 0,1,0 ) discoveries by survey - only and survey+followup , respectively .",
    "this is certainly not a complete accounting , in part because 2016 has just begun and in part because historically there has been a considerable delay in microlensing planet publications for a variety of reasons .",
    "for example , of the 28 planets discovered prior to 2012 , the number with delays ( publication year minus discovery year ) of @xmath117 years was @xmath118 . in the history of microlensing , there has been only one planet published during the discovery year , ogle-2005-blg-071 lb @xcite .",
    "hence , we will only get a full picture of this transition after a few years .",
    "[ [ challenges - to - the - by - eye - and - by - machine - discovery - of - ogle-2016-blg-0596 ] ] challenges to the by - eye and by - machine discovery of ogle-2016-blg-0596 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    there are three interrelated reasons why ogle-2016-blg-0596 may have escaped notice as a potentially planetary event until the kmtnet data for this event were examined ( for reasons unrelated to any apparent anomaly ) .",
    "first , it is relatively faint at peak .",
    "second , it has a variable baseline .",
    "third , it was not announced as a microlensing event until one day after the peak .    as a general rule ,",
    "high - magnification events are singled out for intensive followup observations only if they are still rising .",
    "when such intensive observations would have been reduced , they would have immediately revealed the anomalous nature of the event , probably triggering additional observations .",
    "this is how many of the planets discovered by @xmath3fun were found . while @xmath3fun itself is now semi - dormant , its protocols are directly relevant here because what is of interest is whether there is prima facie evidence for a population of missed planets during past years , during most of which @xmath3fun was active .",
    "now , in fact , ogle-2016-blg-0596 met the criteria for an ogle alert 24 hours previously , but no alert was issued because of caution due to the variable baseline .",
    "nevertheless , even if such an alert had been issued , it would not have triggered any followup observations because ( due to the anomaly ) the event would have appeared to have already peaked at that time .",
    "finally , the variability of the baseline may have influenced modelers and followup groups to discount the evident irregularities in the light curve near peak as being due to data artifacts .",
    "this could have been exacerbated by the faintness of the event , which increases both the formal error bars and the probability of centroiding errors ( hence irregular photometry ) due to bright blends .",
    "both of these effects reduce the confidence of modelers that apparent anomalies in online `` quick look '' photometry are due to physical effects .",
    "it is nevertheless a fact that when the original ogle data are modeled , they show a clear signal for a massive planet or low - mass bd , which would trigger a re - reduction of the data , such as the one we report here .",
    "we therefore conclude that while ogle-2016-blg-0596 has some near - unique features that increased the difficulty of recognizing it as a planetary event , such recognition was clearly feasible .",
    "hence , we do indeed regard this event as prima facie evidence for more such events in archival data , particularly ogle - iv data 2010 - 2015 .",

    "m.  kubiak and g.  pietrzyski , former members of the ogle team , for their contribution to the collection of the ogle photometric data over the past years .",
