[ theorem : main1 ] the set @xmath16 is finite .",

    ", the number @xmath4 gives a quantitative measure of several different dynamical properties of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , given any fixed metric on the surface , @xmath4 gives the growth rate of lengths of a geodesic under iteration by @xmath3 ( * ? ? ? * expos 9 , proposition 19 ) .",
    "the number @xmath18 gives the minimal topological entropy of any homeomorphism in the isotopy class of @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* expos 10 ,  iv ) .",
    "moreover , a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism is essentially the unique minimizer in its isotopy class  it is unique up to conjugacy by a homeomorphism isotopic to the identity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* expos 12 , thorme iii ) .    from a more global perspective ,",
    "recall that the set of isotopy classes of orientation preserving homeomorphisms @xmath19 forms a group called the mapping class group , denoted @xmath20 .",
    "this group acts properly discontinuously by isometries on the teichmller space @xmath21 with quotient the moduli space @xmath22 of riemann surfaces homeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "the closed geodesics in the orbifold @xmath22 correspond precisely to the conjugacy classes of mapping classes represented by pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms , and moreover , the length of a geodesic associated to a pseudo - anosov @xmath0 is @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the length spectrum of @xmath22 is the set @xmath23 arnoux  yoccoz @xcite and ivanov @xcite proved that @xmath24 is a closed discrete subset of @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that @xmath24 has , for each @xmath1 , a least element , which we shall denote by @xmath26 .",
    "we can think of @xmath26 as the _ systole _ of @xmath22 .",
    "penner proved that there exists constants @xmath27 so that for all closed surfaces @xmath1 with @xmath28 , one has @xmath29 the proof of the lower bound comes from a spectral estimate for perron ",
    "frobenius matrices , with @xmath30 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as such , this lower bound is valid for all surfaces @xmath1 with @xmath28 , including punctured surfaces .",
    "the upper bound is proven by constructing pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms @xmath31 on each closed surface of genus @xmath9 so that @xmath32 ; see also @xcite .",
    "the best known upper bound for @xmath33 is due to hironaka  kin @xcite and independently minakawa @xcite , and is @xmath34 .",
    "the situation for punctured surfaces is more mysterious .",
    "there is a constant @xmath35 so that the upper bound of holds for punctured spheres and punctured tori ; see @xcite .",
    "however , tsai has shown that for a surface @xmath36 of fixed genus @xmath9 and variable number of punctures @xmath37 , there is no upper bound @xmath35 for @xmath38 , and in fact , this number grows like @xmath39 as @xmath37 tends to infinity ; see @xcite .",
    "one construction for small dilatation pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms is due to mcmullen @xcite .",
    "the construction , described in the next section , uses @xmath40manifolds and is the motivation for our results .",
    "given @xmath0 , the mapping torus @xmath41 is the total space of a fiber bundle @xmath42 , so that the fiber is the surface @xmath1 . if @xmath43 has dimension at least @xmath44 , then one can perturb the fibration to another fibration @xmath45 whose dual cohomology class is projectively close to the dual of @xmath42 ; see @xcite . in fact , work of thurston",
    "@xcite implies that there is an open cone in @xmath43 with the property that every integral class in this cone is dual to a fiber in a fibration .",
    "moreover , the absolute value of the euler characteristic of these fibers extends to a linear function on this cone which we denote @xmath46 .",
    "fried @xcite proved that the dilatation of the monodromy extends to a continuous function @xmath47 on this cone , such that the reciprocal of its logarithm is homogeneous .",
    "therefore , the product @xmath48 depends only on the projective class and varies continuously .",
    "mcmullen @xcite refined the analysis of the extension @xmath47 , producing a polynomial invariant whose roots determine @xmath47 , and which provides a much richer structure .    in the course of his analysis , mcmullen observed that for a fixed @xmath40manifold @xmath41 , if @xmath49 is a sequence of distinct fibrations of @xmath50 with fiber @xmath51 and monodromy @xmath52 , for which the dual cohomology classes converge projectively to the dual of the original fibration @xmath42 , then @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in particular , @xmath55 is uniformly bounded , independently of @xmath56 , and therefore @xmath57 for some @xmath7 .",
    "there is a mild generalization of this construction obtained by replacing @xmath0 with @xmath14 ( as defined above ) and considering the resulting mapping torus @xmath58 .",
    "mcmullen s construction produces pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms of punctured surfaces from the monodromies of various fibrations of @xmath59 . by filling in any invariant set of punctures ( for example , all of them ) , we obtain homeomorphisms that may or may not be pseudo - anosov ( after filling in the punctures , there may be a @xmath60pronged singularity in the stable and unstable foliation , and this is not allowed for a pseudo - anosov ) . in any case , we can say that all of the pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms obtained in this way are _ generated by @xmath61_. theorem [ theorem : main1 ] can be restated as follows .",
    "[ corollary : fg ] given @xmath62 , there exists a finite set of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms that generate all pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms @xmath63 in the sense above .",
    "corollary [ corollary : fg ] can be viewed as a kind of converse of mcmullen s construction . in view of corollary",
    "[ corollary : fg ] , we have the following natural question .    for",
    "any given @xmath7 , can one explicitly find a finite set of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms that generate @xmath12 ?      puncturing the surface at the singularities is necessary for the validity of theorem [ theorem : main1 ] . indeed , the set of all pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms that occur as the monodromy for a fibration of a fixed @xmath40manifold have a uniform upper bound for the number of prongs at any singularity of the stable foliation . on the other hand , penner s original construction produces a sequence of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms @xmath10 in which the number of prongs at a singularity tends to infinity with @xmath64 .",
    "so , the set @xmath65 of homeomorphism classes of mapping tori of elements of @xmath12 is an infinite set for @xmath7 sufficiently large .    removing the singularities from the stable and unstable foliations of @xmath3 ,",
    "then taking the mapping torus , is the same as _ drilling out _ the closed trajectories through the singular points of the suspension flow in @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we can reconstruct @xmath41 from @xmath58 by _ dehn filling _ ; see @xcite .",
    "the dehn - filled solid tori in @xmath50 are regular neighborhoods of the closed trajectories through the singular points and the _ dehn filling slopes _ are the ( minimal transverse ) intersections of @xmath1 with the boundaries of these neighborhoods . back in @xmath67 ,",
    "the boundaries of the neighborhoods are tori that bound product neighborhoods of the ends of @xmath67 homeomorphic to @xmath68 . here",
    "the filling slopes are described as the intersections of @xmath69 with these tori and are called the _ boundary slopes of the fiber @xmath69_.    moreover , since all of the manifolds in @xmath16 are mapping tori for pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms , they all admit a complete finite volume hyperbolic metric by thurston s geometrization theorem for fibered @xmath40manifolds ( see , e.g.@xcite , @xcite ) . as another corollary of theorem [ theorem : main1 ] , we obtain the following .

    "[ c : bounded volume ] the set of hyperbolic volumes of @xmath40manifolds in @xmath65 is bounded by a constant depending only on @xmath7 .",

    "we now ask if the dehn filling is necessary in the statement of corollary  [ c : magic ? ] :    does there exist a single @xmath40manifold that contains infinitely many minimizers ? that is , does there exist a hyperbolic @xmath40manifold @xmath50 that fibers over the circle in infinitely many different ways @xmath96 , so that the monodromies @xmath97 satisfy @xmath98 ?      to explain the motivation for the proof , we again consider mcmullen s construction . in a fixed fibered @xmath40manifold @xmath99 , oertel proved that all of the fibers @xmath51 for which the dual cohomology classes lie in the open cone described above are carried by a finite number of _ branched surfaces _ transverse to the suspension flow .",
    "a branched surface is a @xmath44dimensional analogue in a @xmath40manifold of a train track on a surface ; see @xcite .    basically , an infinite sequence of fibers in @xmath50 whose dual cohomology classes are projectively converging are building up larger and larger `` product regions '' because they all live in a single @xmath40manifold .",
    "these product regions can be collapsed down , and the images of the fibers under this collapse define a finite number of branched surfaces .",
    "our proof follows this idea by trying to find `` large product regions '' in the mapping torus that can be collapsed , so that the fiber projects onto a branched surface of uniformly bounded complexity . in our case",
    ", we do not know that we are in a fixed @xmath40manifold ( indeed , we may not be ) , so the product regions must come from a different source than in the single @xmath40manifold setting ; this is where the small dilatation assumption is used .",
    "moreover , the collapsing construction we describe does not in general produce a branched surface in a @xmath40manifold .",
    "however , the failure occurs only along the closed trajectories through the singular points , and after removing the singularities , the result of collapsing is indeed a @xmath40manifold .",
    "while this is only a heuristic ( for example , the reader never actually needs to know what a branched surface is ) , it is helpful to keep in mind while reading the proof , which we now outline .",
    "first we replace all punctures by marked points , so @xmath1 is a closed surface with marked points .",
    "let @xmath41 be the mapping torus , which is now a compact @xmath40manifold .",

    "when a rectangle @xmath104 and all of the rectangles `` adjacent '' to it are taken homeomorphically onto other rectangles of the markov partition by both @xmath3 and @xmath105 , then we declare @xmath106 and @xmath107 to be `` @xmath103equivalent '' [ section [ s : equiv rel ] ] .",
    "this generates an equivalence relation on rectangles with a uniformly bounded number of equivalence classes [ corollary [ c : relation 1 prop ] ] .",
    "moreover , if two different rectangles are equivalent by a power of @xmath3 , then that power of @xmath3 is cellular on those rectangles with respect to the cell structure @xmath103 on @xmath1 [ proposition [ p : sim1 and y ] ] .    in the mapping torus @xmath66 , the suspension flow @xmath108 applied to the rectangle for @xmath109",
    "defines a `` box '' in the 3manifold , and applying this to all rectangles in @xmath101 produces a decomposition of @xmath50 into boxes which can be turned into a cell structure @xmath110 on @xmath50 so that @xmath111 with its cell structure @xmath103 is a subcomplex [ section [ s:3-mfd ] ] .",

    "the uniform boundedness is a result of careful analysis of the cell structures @xmath103 and @xmath110 on @xmath1 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
