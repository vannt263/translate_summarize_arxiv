    "the sun evolves continuously over a broad range of spatio - temporal scales .",

    "the doppler shifting of spectral absorption lines , whose height of formation is altered by these wave motions , provides a direct measurement of the seismic wavefield . because we measure ` noise ' , i.e. , a superposition of a multitude of randomly excited waves , we compute and average auto- and cross - correlations of the wavefield ( between records at different spatial locations ) .",
    "the wavefield of the sun is described as an ergodic and temporally stationary random process , whose statistics are observed to be gaussian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a critical goal of helioseismology is to image the properties of turbulence in the interior , the sub - surface structure of magnetic fields , and internal circulations of plasma .",
    "however , these phenomena that we want to image are undergoing constant evolution .",
    "the fundamental question of how the properties of a temporally changing medium are imprinted in seismic measurements arises .",

    "homogenization , a mathematical technique based on a two - scale asymptotic analysis , is a treatment of wave propagation in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "it gives us a means for deriving an effective medium , replacing a rapidly varying medium by a smoother equivalent that to first order is able to model wave propagation on large wavelengths .",
    "an analogy may be drawn to floquet - bloch descriptions @xcite , which addresses the energy eigenfunction of an electron within a periodic potential .",
    "the theory of homogenization , easily realized for wave propagation in deterministic periodic media , was extended by @xcite and @xcite to ergodic random media by allowing for the periodicity length scale to become infinite . in other words , @xcite and @xcite realized that an ergodic random medium is essentially a periodic medium , but repeating on infinitely long length scales .",
    "thus the method assists us in interpreting the ( mostly ) horizontally stationary and ergodic random process that helioseismic waves are described by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "temporally fluctuating coefficients can pump energy into the wave system .",
    "however , this particular form of the wave equation conserves energy . to demonstrate that this is the case , we divide equation  ( [ eq.orig ] ) by @xmath25 , multiply it by @xmath26 and integrate over volume to obtain @xmath27 which may be manipulated further , @xmath28 = 0,\\label{ener1}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and we have assumed , for the sake of simplicity , that the boundaries are periodic .",

    "it is also important to note that this equation does not always produce a stable solution , and that oscillating coefficients can destabilize the wave equation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this occurs because oscillating coefficients pump energy into the system and in this particular scenario , we control this by introducing a damping term .",
    "we study equation  ( [ eq.orig ] ) numerically in order to characterize the bounds and effectiveness of homogenization at addressing wavespeed perturbations .",

    "more complicated yet and in fact much less understood mathematically is the practically interesting case of fluctuations in both time and space .",
    "it is known for some specific choices of the coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath25 that the wave equation may not have bounded solutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "granulation in the sun is a process that is spatially horizontally ` periodic ' and substantially smaller than typical acoustic wavelengths . in this simplistic model of wave propagation through granules , we consider a spatially periodic grid of sound speed perturbations , shown in figure  [ soundspeed ] .",

    "once we obtain the vector @xmath107 , we compute the wavespeed tensor using equation  ( [ tensorwave ] ) .",
    "the cell problem studied here has cylindrically symmetry , i.e. , each of the sound - speed perturbations is azimuthally symmetric around its axis .",
    "this implies that the wave speed tensor will contain identical components in the @xmath113 and @xmath114 planes , providing us another way to test the code .",
    "once we obtain the homogenized wave speed tensor , which is essentially a constant sound speed in the @xmath113 and @xmath114 planes , we can compare the true and homogenized solutions .",
    "we set off a source at the center of the computational domain and compare the homogenized and true solutions in figure  [ snapspace ] .",
    "the corrector , given by @xmath115 , contains the higher - order scattering terms not fully captured by the homogenized solution .",
    "we show the corrector also in figure  [ snapspace ] , which contribute to a decoherence of the input wave packet , thereby contributing to observed wave attenuation .",
    "the wave fields are practically identical , indicating that the infinite wavelength limit works very accurately at modeling these ` granules ' .",
    "in the cases we have considered thus far , the media consists of periodic arrays of scatterers .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that random media where the time - independent perturbations have short correlation length scales and are drawn from stationary and ergodic distributions , the expectation value of the wavefield is given by the ensemble average of equation  ( [ tensorwave ] ) .",
    "the result rests on the argument that random media are the limiting case of a period medium with an infinite periodicity length scale .",
    "see @xcite for additional details on the theory of homogenization in random media .",
    "although mathematically more difficult to establish than homogenization theory in periodic media , the main conclusions drawn in periodic media typically also hold in random media . indeed ,",
    "seeing random media as a limit of periodic media with increasing cell size , we may obtain the homogenized coefficients in random media @xmath116 and @xmath117 as the limits given in - as the sizes @xmath118 and @xmath119 tend to @xmath120 .    in this section ,",
    "we show a simple case where we tile the 2-d computational domain with a randomly generated square of sound - speed perturbations .",
    "the perturbations are drawn from a zero - mean uniform distribution with an amplitude of 8 km / s , where the nominal sound speed is 10 km / s .",
    "this square is successively increased in size till it is the size of the entire domain .",
    "in other words , for a computational domain of @xmath121 we choose tiles of sizes @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the full medium is then filtered to remove the top third highest spatial frequencies ( up to the spatial nyquist ) in order to prevent aliasing from corrupting the numerical simulation ( orszag s two - thirds rule * ? ? ?",
    "the dominant power in the spectrum of the fluctuations is on length scales smaller than the peak wavelength of the wave , 3.33 mm . to leading order",
    ", we show that the wavefield is the same in all the cases in figure  [ random.result ] .",
    "a more thorough investigation may be performed , where for a given size of the cell , the cell problem  ( [ elip ] ) is solved for a number of realizations and the variance of the homogenized coefficient  ( [ tensorwave ] ) is estimated .",
    "it can be shown that the variance of the homogenized coefficient falls as @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the size of the tile and @xmath126 describes some rate .",
    "optimal rates of convergence for random coefficients with short - range correlations may be obtained ( for a slightly modified problem ) in @xcite .",
    "these analyses are difficult and not known for large classes of processes .",
    "the wkbj approximation represents the zero wavelength limit of wave propagation , where the scale over which the structure changes is substantially larger than the wavelength . however , the sun displays structure over a broad range of scales and consequently , the asymptotic infinite wavelength limit is also very important to understand .",
    "it is believed small - scale granulation likely plays a critical role in scattering waves and distorting eigenfunctions of normal modes @xcite . from the numerical experiments we have performed here",
    ", we find that when spatio - temporal scales are separated , scattering will be very weak and that strong scattering happens only in the case where the scales overlap .",
    "this may have important implications for granular scattering of waves , where the spatial scale separation is significant but the temporal scales of its evolution are similar .",
    "not surprisingly , asymptotic methods break down in this strong scattering regime .",
    "modeling these effects is an important step towards interpreting seismic measurements appropriately .",
    "most interestingly the analysis reveals that the effective medium possesses a tensorial wavespeed and can potentially induce anisotropy in wave propagation .",
    "we compute the corrector , which represents higher - order scattering that contributes to the overall decoherence of the wavefield .",
    "a powerful extension of the periodic case ( that we have studied here ) is to ergodic random media where the probability density function describing the randomness is translationally invariant .",
    "granulation and supergranulation fall into this regime , both being described by translationally horizontally invariant quasi - random processes .",
