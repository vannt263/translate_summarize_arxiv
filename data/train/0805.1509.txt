    "color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are some of the most intriguing topics in modern theoretical physics . quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "is believed to be the ultimate theory describing strong interactions .",
    "nowadays it is accepted that the main ground state properties of qcd can be described in terms of non perturbative spontaneous breaking and/or restoring of some of the global symmetries of the qcd lagrangian .    unfortunately solving qcd in its non perturbative regime",
    "is a hard task . at zero and",
    "small quark chemical potential @xmath0 lattice calculations are a good tool to derive the equation of state of qcd matter , the transition temperatures and so on starting from the first principles , see for example  @xcite and references therein .",
    "several approximation methods are available to overcome the sign problem of the fermion determinant with three colors at finite @xmath0 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews on the sign problem ) : small-@xmath0 expansion  @xcite , reweighting tecniques  @xcite , density of the states methods  @xcite and analytic continuation to imaginary chemical potential  @xcite .    besides lattice calculations there exist effective descriptions of qcd . among them",
    "nambu - jona lasinio ( njl in the following ) models  @xcite are very popular , see  @xcite for reviews .",
    "they are based on the observation that several properties of the qcd ground state are related to the spontaneous breaking of some of the global symmetries of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "therefore one hopes that by a model that has the same global symmetry breaking of qcd one can capture the essential physics of qcd itself .    in recent years",
    "it has been argued that the njl model , which does not contain gluons , can be improved by adding a non linear term to the lagrangian which describes the dynamics of the traced polyakov loop  @xcite , and an interaction term of the polyakov loop with the quarks .",
    "the resulting model is called the pnjl model , introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and extensively studied in  @xcite . in the pnjl model one assumes that a homogeneous euclidean temporal background gluon field couples to the quarks via the covariant derivative of qcd .",
    "this coupling gives rise to the interplay between the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop .",
    "even if it is very simple , the pnjl model turned out to be a powerful tool which allows to compute several quantities that can be computed on the lattice as well .",
    "the agreement with existing lattice data is satisfactory  @xcite .",
    "one of the exciting characteristics of the pnjl model is the _ statistical confinement _ of quarks at low temperature  . in a few words",
    "this means that at small temperature and small chemical potential the contribution to the free energy , @xmath4 , of the states with one and two quarks are suppressed , and the leading contribution to @xmath4 arises from the thermal excitations of colorless three quark states .",
    "this property is related to the small value of the expectation value of polyakov loop which is found in the self - consistent calculations within the pnjl model in the aforementioned conditions of temperature and chemical potential .",
    "it has been recently argued by fukushima that the statistical confinement property of the pnjl model persists even at high chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with the phase diagram of qcd obtained in the large number of colors @xmath3 approximation  @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for recent related studies .",
    "inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite fukushima has suggested to interpret the statistical confined phase of the pnjl model at high quark chemical potential as the quarkyonic state found in  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate on the ground state of the electrically neutral two flavor pnjl model , focusing on its possible quarkyonic structure at high @xmath0 and low @xmath1 .",
    "we use a non local four fermion interaction instead of the local one  @xcite . the local njl model is usually regularized by means of an ultraviolet sharp cutoff , which amounts to artificially cutoff the quark momenta that are larger than the cutoff itself .",
    "thus the extensions of the model to temperatures and/or chemical potentials of the order of the cutoff are quite dubious .",
    "however if one introduces a non local interaction , which corresponds to the multiplication of the njl coupling by a momentum dependent form factor @xmath5 , and requires that the form factor satisfies the asymptotic freedom property of qcd @xmath6 , then all of the momentum integrals are convergent and the model is consistent at any value of temperature and chemical potential . in this paper",
    "we use one specific form of the form factor .",
    "although the choice of a different functional form for @xmath5 can lead to different quantitative results ( mainly the shift of the critical points ) we believe that our picture should not be modified qualitatively .",
    "we consider the logarithmic form of the polyakov loop effective potential @xmath7 suggested by ratti , roessner and weise in ref .",
    "@xcite ; moreover we investigate on the effects of a dependence of @xmath7 on the quark chemical potential as well as on the number of flavors as suggested in ref .",
    "we compare the phase diagrams obtained in the cases in which we do not consider ( cases i and ii ) and do consider ( case iii ) the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "cases i and ii differ for the value of the deconfinement scale in the polyakov loop effective potential .",
    "we find that the phase diagram in the two cases ( i and ii on one side , iii on the other side ) differ even qualitatively .",
    "in particular , on one hand in the cases i and ii we confirm the results of fukushima  @xcite and strengthen his interpretation of the high chemical potential / small temperature state of the pnjl model as the quarkyonic matter of the large @xmath3 phase diagram . on the other hand in case iii we find that the quarkyonic - like window found in the cases i and ii is shrunk and becomes a small region in the @xmath8 plane in the case iii , opening a wide room for the deconfined quark matter of the pure njl model .",

    "finally the analysis of the peaks of the susceptibilities @xmath202 and @xmath146 ( lower left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : caxx1 ] ) reveals that the @xmath2 crossover occurs at @xmath203 mev .",
    "in this section we compare the qualitative picture that arises from the study of the phase diagram of the neutral pnjl model within two scenarios : the first one corresponds to keeping an independent @xmath187 , case i ; the second one corresponds to keeping a @xmath0-dependent @xmath187 , case iii .",
    "the results that we have discussed in the previous sections show that the phase diagram of the pnjl model in the case i at low temperatures is similar to the phase diagram obtained in the large @xmath3 approximation of qcd , see refs .  @xcite . at low temperatures the latter phase diagram consists of two regions : the first one at low values of @xmath0 , defined as the _ confined phase _ and characterized by @xmath164 and a vanishing baryon density ; the second one at large values of @xmath0 called _ quarkonia _ in which @xmath164 but the baryon density is not vanishing . finally at high temperature",
    "one finds the _ deconfined phase _ with @xmath204 and a non vanishing baryon density . in the quarkyonic phase",
    "the free energy is that of free quarks , but the thermal excitations are those of baryons .",
    "our previous discussion and figs .",
    "[ fig : m300 ] and  [ fig : bd ] show that this happens even in the pnjl model in the low temperature regime .",
    "therefore the pnjl model with parametrization i approximately reproduces the large @xmath3 phase diagram at low temperatures , if one interprets the state with @xmath153 at high @xmath0 with the quarkyonic phase of large @xmath3 .",
    "this fact has been already noticed in a study of the three flavor model by fukushima  @xcite where the author has suggested to identify the low temperature - high density ground state of the model as the quarkyonic phase of large @xmath3 qcd .",
    "our results strengthen this idea and thus suggest that the quarkyonic - like ground state of low temperature - high density pnjl model is not a peculiarity of the three flavor case , but it seems to be a characteristic of the pnjl model itself , as far as we do not include an explicit @xmath0 dependence into the coefficients of @xmath7 ( we discuss this case in a next subsection ) .",
    "the main difference between large @xmath3 and pnjl is that in the latter model one can excite one and two quark states ( that is @xmath2 charges ) if the temperature is high enough . as a consequence ,",
    "the deconfinement transition observed in the large @xmath3 model at high temperature and high chemical potential is replaced in the present model by a smooth @xmath2 crossover .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - im ] we show a cartoon phase diagram of the neutral two flavor pnjl model and a comparison with that obtained in the large @xmath3 approximation  @xcite .",
    "the bold line denotes the chiral crossover as well as the chiral first order transition .",
    "the thin line corresponds to the deconfinement crossover .",
    "both of these lines are the same which we have shown in fig .  [ fig : phased ] .",
    "since this is simply a cartoon we do not distinguish between the crossover ( small @xmath0 ) and first order transition ( higher values of @xmath0 ) . in the pnjl model the quark density does not vanish at any finite temperature , even if for small chemical potential @xmath154 is very small at low temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bd ] ) . to compare the phase diagram of the pnjl model with that of the large @xmath3 approximation",
    "we need a criterion to say if @xmath154 is zero or not .",
    "analogously to ref .",
    "@xcite we identify the @xmath154 crossover with the value of @xmath0 corresponding to the inflection point of the quark density .",
    "we find that the @xmath154 crossover defined in this way coincides with the chiral crossover as in ref .",
    "therefore the chiral crossover line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - im ] represents the density crossover as well . in the chiral broken phase and at low temperature @xmath205 . on the other hand @xmath206 in correspondence to the chiral symmetric phase at low temperature . at high temperature @xmath206 both in the chiral broken and in the chiral restored phases .    at low temperature",
    "we have @xmath207 both on the left and on the right of the dashed line , see figs .  [",
    "fig : m0 ] and  [ fig : m300 ] . at low temperature the region with broken chiral symmetry has the same characteristics of the hadron phase found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; on the other hand at low temperature the region on the right of the dashed line has the same characteristics of the quarkyonic phase found in ref .  @xcite . for these reasons",
    "we have called the two regions _ hadronic - like _ and _ quarkyonic - like _ respectively .",
    "we stress that this analogy holds strictly speaking only at low temperature ( for temperatures of the order of one hundred mev @xmath206 even in the chiral broken phase , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bd ] ) .",
    "finally at high temperature ( above the @xmath2 transition line ) we have both @xmath21 of order of unity and @xmath208 .",
    "in analogy to the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite we call this region of the phase diagram the _ deconfined - like _ phase .",
    "we briefly compare the results discussed above in relation with the case i with those obtained in the large @xmath3 approximation and at @xmath136 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the author discusses a gap in the spectrum of quarkyonic matter within a model .",
    "such a gap is given by the pion mass , @xmath209 , which becomes larger as @xmath0 is increased . even if the values of @xmath209 as a function of @xmath0 computed in ref .",
    "@xcite might differ from the non local pnjl ones , the calculations of @xmath209 carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite using the local njl model show that the qualitative behavior of @xmath209 as a function of @xmath0 is the same in the two models .",
    "thus in the pnjl model we expect a large pion mass at large @xmath0 as well .",
    "however this mass does not correspond to the gap in the excitations spectrum in our model . as a matter of fact in the quarkyonic - like region of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - im ] the three quark states can be excited ; each quark has a constituent mass @xmath92 given by eq .   and",
    "plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : m0 ] and  [ fig : m300 ] , hence the three quark state has a mass @xmath210 which at small quark momenta and large @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath211 mev .",
    "therefore in our case a gap in the spectrum still exists but it is given by the three quark state mass which is much lighter than @xmath209 .",
    "we now turn on the parametrization iii .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the small chemical potential region of the phase diagram in case iii is qualitatively similar to that obtained in the case i , therefore we focus on the low temperature / large chemical potential region from now on . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedcomp ] we draw the low temperature phase diagram of the pnjl model with parametrization iii .",
    "the bold line denotes the chiral transition ; the thin line corresponds to the @xmath2 transition . as in the previous section",
    "the transition lines are computed by looking at the peaks of the chiral and @xmath146 susceptibilities .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedcomp ] should be compared with the analogous diagram obtained for the parametrization i which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phased ] .",
    "the main effect of choosing the parameter @xmath187 as a @xmath0 dependent one in the polyakov loop potential is the lowering of the @xmath2 transition line .",
    "moreover the wide quarkyonic - like window in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - im ] is shrunk to a small region in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedcomp ] . at low temperature",
    "it is enough to reach a chemical potential of the order of @xmath150 mev to have @xmath212 and a net quark density ; both these characteristics define the deconfined phase of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - im ]  @xcite .",
    "even if we have used the particular form @xmath213 suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite we are confident that the aforementioned results are simply due to the lowering of the deconfinement scale @xmath187 as @xmath0 is increased and not to the detailed analytical form of @xmath213 .",
    "thus our picture should be qualitatively robust .    before closing this section",
    "we make a brief comment on the possible study of the scenarios discussed above on lattice .",
    "recently the density of states ( dos ) method has been used to investigate the qcd phase transition at large @xmath0  @xcite . in this paper the qcd phase diagram is mapped by studying the plaquette expectation value in the @xmath8 plane . although the lattice size implemented in  @xcite",
    "is relatively small and a finite volume study is still missing , so that the results should be taken as preliminary , an interesting phase transition is observed as @xmath0 crosses a critical value @xmath214 at a fixed temperature .",
    "moreover the quark number shows a sudden rise as @xmath0 reaches @xmath214 .",
    "the qualitative behavior is similar in the pnjl model , see figs .",
    "[ fig : m0 ] ,  [ fig : m300 ] and  [ fig : bd ] . in the pnjl calculation with parametrization of case",
    "i and ii ( fixed values of @xmath215 ) at low temperature and in the correspondence of the the chiral crossover a small jump of the polyakov loop occurs , the true @xmath2 crossover being shifted to larger values of @xmath0 . on the other hand , in case iii with a @xmath0-dependent @xmath215 , a net rise of @xmath21 occurs in correspondence of the chiral crossover .",
    "it would be very interesting if by means of the dos method one could compute the expectation value of the polyakov loop , as well as the chiral and the polyakov loop susceptibilities , in the low temperature regime as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this lattice calculation might improve the understanding of the new low temperature / large chemical potential state of matter claimed in  @xcite , and at the same time it would allow to distinguish between the two pnjl scenarios discussed in this paper .",
    "in this paper we have investigated on the landscape of the possible phases of the neutral two flavor pnjl model .",
    "we have considered the logarithmic effective potential of the polyakov loop @xmath216  @xcite , see eq .  , and a non local interaction in the quark sector ,",
    "see eqs .  - .",
    "our main results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : phased ] and  [ fig : phasedcomp ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : phased ] corresponds to a fixed value of @xmath187 in the polyakov loop effective potential . in this case",
    "the phase diagram is qualitatively similar to that obtained in the large @xmath3 approximation of qcd  @xcite .    in particular , at high chemical potential and low temperature",
    "we find a phase in which the main contribution to the thermal quark population is given by @xmath2 neutral states , that is three quark states made of one red quark , one green quark and one blue quark .",
    "this characteristic resembles the quarkyonic phase of ref .",
    "the quarkyonic - like structure of the ground state of the pnjl model has been already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite in non neutral and three flavor version of the model .",
    "moreover the @xmath2 transition line has been already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with a different effective potential for the polyakov loop and in a non neutral state .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are qualitatively similar to ours .",
    "therefore we suggest that the quarkyonic - like state of matter is a feature of the pnjl model , independently to the number of flavors and to the difference of the chemical potentials between quarks , as far as a @xmath0 dependence of the coefficients of @xmath216 is not considered .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedcomp ] we show the phase diagram of the model when a @xmath0 dependence of the coefficients of the effective potential of the polyakov loop is introduced .",
    "we have used the analytic form suggested in ref .",
    "the main results are the lowering of the @xmath2 transition line of fig .",
    "[ fig : phased ] , and the shrinking of the quarkyonic - like phase window of fig .",
    "[ fig : phased ] .",
    "we have used the form of @xmath213 of ref .",
    "we believe that the result is rather robust as it does not follow from such a detailed form but only from the lower scale of deconfinement when mu increases .    we have not considered in this work for simplicity the possibility of color superconductivity at high @xmath0  @xcite . at a first sight it could seem that the results found with parameterizations i and ii , i.e. a quarkyonic - like phase at high chemical potential and low temperature , exclude the possibility of a superconductive gap in the spectrum .",
    "this reasoning could be supported by the observation that the quarkyonic - like phase is similar to a confined phase , differing from the latter only for a non zero value of the quark density .",
    "such a conclusion is not necessarily true . as a matter of fact , even if not noticed explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite for the two flavor and in  @xcite for the three flavor models where the color superconductivity has been kept into account , in the quarkyonic - like region ( high @xmath0 and small @xmath1 ) the minimization of the thermodynamic potential leads to a phase where quarks have a color superconductive gap in the spectrum .",
    "it is the 2sc gap  @xcite in the two flavor case , and the cfl gap  @xcite in the three flavor case .",
    "therefore the realization of a color superconductive phase in the pnjl models at high @xmath0 and small @xmath1 is not forbidden in principle , even if the ground state has a quarkyonic structure .",
    "an interesting investigation is the computation of the spectra of the mesonic and baryonic thermal excitations in the quarkyonic - like phase of the pnjl model , and compare them with those obtained in a different model  @xcite that mimics qcd in the large @xmath3 approximation .",

    "<S> we study the interplay between the chiral and the deconfinement transitions , both at high temperature and high quark chemical potential , by a non local nambu - jona lasinio model with the polyakov loop in the mean field approximation and requiring neutrality of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three forms of the effective potential of the polyakov loop : two of them with a fixed deconfinement scale , cases i and ii , and the third one with a @xmath0 dependent scale , case iii . in the cases i and ii , at high chemical potential @xmath0 and low temperature @xmath1 the main contribution to the free energy is due to the @xmath2-neutral three - quark states , mimicking the quarkyonic phase of the large @xmath3 phase diagram . on the other hand in the case </S>",
    "<S> iii the quarkyonic window is shrunk to a small region . </S>",
    "<S> finally we comment on the relations of these results to lattice studies and on possible common prospects . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly comment on the coexistence of quarkyonic and color superconductive phases . </S>"
