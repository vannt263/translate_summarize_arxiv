    "entanglement is one of the central keys for quantum information processing , being associated with various puzzling quantum phenomena , such as bell s inequality violation and quantum teleportation , for example .",
    "it is also a main resource for the exponential speedup in some quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of entanglement is important . for that , many tools have been developed , one of these are the entanglement witnesses .",
    "entanglement witnesses are tools designed to detect entanglement from direct measurements of observables .",
    "they can be used either to detect entanglement in a given state , or to quantify the entanglement for a specific state or class of states @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the use of entanglement witnesses is the possibility of detection of entanglement without performing quantum state tomography , which can significantly reduce the number of measurements performed in the system , in order to characterize some quantum effect due to the presence of entanglement .    during the last few years",
    "there have been proposals and experimental implementations of entanglement witnesses for various different quantum systems , like optical @xcite and magnetic ones @xcite .",
    "although nmr techniques have been successfully used to implement quantum protocols @xcite , like quantum teleportation @xcite and shor s @xcite algorithm , besides several other quantum simulations @xcite , only recently a proposal of ew has been made for nmr quantum information processing experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    "it is demonstrated the implementation of such a ew in a class of states , and it is also proposed some other entanglement witnesses .",
    "recently , a proposal for an ew has been made for nmr quantum information processing @xcite which uses the superdense coding protocol , successfully implemented with nmr by fang et al @xcite .",
    "the circuit for the superdense coding is given in the figure [ superdense ] .",
    "for a pure state , the circuit transmits two classical bits of information with only one qubit transmitted .",
    "the input state in the superdense coding , @xmath0 , passes through an erp gate @xcite , becoming the cat state , @xmath1 ( first part of figure [ superdense ] ) . the encoded message is then chosen by a `` message '' operator , applied only at the first qubit , that transforms the cat state into one of the four states of the bell basis ( the operator @xmath2 at the second part of figure [ superdense ] ) .",
    "this operator is given by @xmath3 , @xmath4 or the product @xmath5 .",
    "then , the first qubit , which was modified by the message operator is sent to the other person which has the other qubit of the entangled pair , and a measurement at the bell basis is performed in each qubit ( final part of the figure [ superdense ] ) .",
    "the result of the readouts , measured at each qubit , is dependent of the `` message '' operator . by the knowledge of the sent message , the transmission of the two classical bits of information with only one qubit transmited",
    "is completed .    in nmr systems one deals with",
    "not pure , but mixed states , due to the large number of molecules in a sample .",
    "then , it is necessary to consider the above circuit in the context of mixed states .",
    "the equilibrium state of a nmr system containing two qubits can be written in form @xmath6    where @xmath7    and the indexes @xmath8 and @xmath9 label each of the nuclear spins used as qubits .",
    "being transformed in the cat state , @xmath1 . after it , the `` message '' operator is applied , taking @xmath1 into one of the four bell basis states .",
    "the final part of the circuit indicates the measurement in the bell basis . ]",
    "by applying an epr gate @xcite ( first part of the circuit in figure [ superdense ] ) to this state the output will be a bell - diagonal state : @xmath10    where @xmath1 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the states of the bell basis .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is the relation between the magnetic and thermal energies and is typically @xmath15 .",
    "the spin magnetizations are measured at the end of the circuit and are proportional to the polarization of the state , @xmath16 ( see the section 4 ) .",
    "they are given by @xmath17    if the variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the encripted message , are known , the nmr implementation of the superdense coding is successful .",
    "the statistical condition for success in the nmr implementation of superdense coding and the condition for the entanglement of the bell - diagonal states are the same , and are given by @xcite : @xmath20 this equation can be used to define an entanglement witness , as @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 . using the expressions for the probabilities and those for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 the measurements of the magnetizations @xmath27 and @xmath28 at the end of the circuit are equivalent to the measurements of @xmath29 ( see fig . [ superdense ] ) in the bell basis , since @xmath30 @xmath31 which yields : @xmath32    this equation shows explicitly that @xmath21 is a measure of the correlations between the two qubits .",
    "in this section , we propose a set of optimal decomposable entanglement witnesses , which can detect the entanglement of states in the vicinity of the bell states . in relation to the witness @xmath21 ,",
    "one pays the price of performing just one more local measurements , in order to have a finer description of the entanglement , as seen in fig .",
    "7 ( see next section ) .",
    "the new witnesses are of the form : @xmath33 to guarantee that @xmath34 have a positive expectation value on all separable states @xmath35 , we have just to impose that the partial transpose of @xmath34 is a positive operator , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "this follows from the fact that if @xmath35 is a bipartite separable state , so is its partial transpose , @xmath37 .",
    "therefore @xmath38 , which shows that @xmath34 is a valid entanglement witness .",
    "now , for a given bell state @xmath39 , an optimal witness in the form of eq.([wxyz ] ) is obtained by solving the following semidefinite program ( sdp ) : @xcite :    _ minimize _",
    "@xmath41    the sdp ( eq.[sdpw ] ) yields the witnesses in tab . 1 .    [ tabela ]    .optimal entanglement witnesses for the bell states in the form @xmath42 .",

    "it was also shown how is the detection of the entanglement by the ew in the nmr decoherence proccess , the transversal relaxation . in this case",
    ", it was clearly shown the presence of a time interval which has a little presence of entanglement that is not detected by the ew . instead of the fact that the ew can not be used to quantify entanglement for the two classes of states studied in this paper",
    ", this ew can detect entanglement for a large number of states in these two situations with the application of only one preparatory pulse to measure the ew . while the complete quantum state tomography , necessary to calculate entanglement quantifiers such as the generalized robustness and the concurrence , demands the application of four pulses to reconstruct the density matrix .",
    "it was also proposed by a simple method other entanglement witnesses , @xmath34 , that are optimal for each region of the entangled bell - diagonal states . as could be seen by an example",
    ", these ew can detect the entangled bell - diagonal states that are not detected by @xmath21 . in the context of relaxation , the comparison of the two entanglement witnesses @xmath34 and @xmath21 shows that both detects the presence of entanglement in the same region , but @xmath34 with the advantage of a better quantification of entanglement in this region .",
    "a possible next step would be the development of an ew that is optimall in the context of relaxation for a given state .",
