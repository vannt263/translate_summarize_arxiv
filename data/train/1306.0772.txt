    "the rapidly increasing growth of user - traffic in cellular networks is forcing the need for the deployment of multi - tier heterogeneous networks as well as the development of better analytic methods for quantifying their performance .",
    "based on information theoretic arguments , one key performance metric is the signal - to - interference - and - nose - ratio ( sinr ) experienced by a typical user in the network .",
    "the sinr is a function of _ propagation processes _ , which incorporate the distance - dependent path - loss function and ( often assumed to be random ) fading and/or shadowing , which we refer to as _ propagation effects_. consequently , results that cast light on the nature of propagation processes ultimately aid in studying the sinr and other useful characteristics of heterogeneous networks .",
    "the irregularity of cellular network configurations means that base station positioning is often best assumed to be random , which has motivated the use of models based on stochastic geometry .",
    "this assertion has been supported in recent years with tractable models based on the poisson point process yielding accurate solutions @xcite . besides the usual tractability and `",
    "worst - case ' arguments for poisson models , a recent result  @xcite has shown that a broad range of network configurations give propagation - based results appearing as though the placement of base stations is a poisson process when sufficiently large log - normal shadowing is incorporated into the model .    in this work we present two simple yet very useful results on the invariance and equivalence of network characteristics , such as sinr , that are functions of propagation processes .",
    "more precisely , we present a marked poisson model of a random heterogeneous network with the standard power - law path - loss function . under this model , we assume that the propagation process parameters and base station parameters are all random .",
    "we present a generalized version of _ propagation ( process ) invariance _ , which shows that propagation processes only depend on one key moment of the random propagation effects and not their distribution .",
    "we list how this result has been used previously in the field of communications .",
    "building upon the propagation invariance , we then present the main _ network equivalence _",
    "result stating how a general random heterogeneous network model can be immediately replaced with a ` equivalent ' network model with the previously random values , including path - loss exponents , all set to constants .",
    "the equivalent ` less random ' model induces the same propagation process and allows for tractable models of multi - tier cellular networks .",
    "this network equivalence allows for the comparison of seemingly quite different heterogeneous models by finding their isotropic and , hence , comparable forms .",
    "furthermore , we observe for a constant path - loss exponent the isotropic representation reduces simply to a homothecy ( a modification of the constant intensity ) of the original network , which generalizes a previous result showing that the propagation processes only depend on some moment of the emitted power and propagation effects .",
    "we illustrate the network equivalence result by giving examples and demonstrating how random path - loss exponents effectively change the network density .",
    "we conclude by discussing possible applications such as deriving @xmath0-coverage probability expressions for multi - tier networks in the spirit of  @xcite or deriving more general results that allow the replacement of location - dependent networks with more tractable stationary models .",
    "gilbert and pollak  @xcite derived a classic result showing that a shot noise process , consisting of a sum of functions of poisson points and some random parameter , remains invariant for many different functions and distributions of random parameters .",
    "lowen and teich  @xcite applied this result to the sum of the power - law functions , akin to the commonly used path - loss function found here , and showed that the sum is independent of the parameter distribution and only relies upon one moment of the random parameter . in the context of sinr of cellular networks , baszczyszyn et al .",

    "@xcite used the same argument to derive the sinr - based @xmath0-coverage probability for a single - tier network by first assuming rayleigh fading , then lifting the assumption via propagation invariance .",
    "it should be stressed that this approach applies to all results based on functions of propagation processes and not just results involving sums or interference terms .",
    "a worthy pursuit would be to list all such results that hold under arbitrary propagation effects , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our second result involves the equivalence of heterogeneous networks with random parameters , including path - loss exponents . for tractability , the aforementioned multi - tier results all assumed constant path - loss exponents across all tiers .",
