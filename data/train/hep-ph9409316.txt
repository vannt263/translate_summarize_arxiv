    "[ intro ]    heavy - quark spin - flavor symmetries are very useful for understanding the properties of hadrons containing a single heavy quark in kinematic regimes where nonperturbative aspects of the strong interaction are dominant .",
    "these symmetries arise from the fact that the charm , bottom , and top quarks are much heavier than @xmath9 .",
    "the symmetry is exact in the limit of infinite quark mass , and corrections can be systematically organized into an expansion in powers of @xmath10 using heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "there has been much progress on the applications of heavy - quark symmetries and hqet to the spectroscopy , and to both exclusive and inclusive decays , of charm and bottom hadrons @xcite .",
    "it has recently been pointed out by jaffe and randall @xcite that hqet can also be applied to the fragmentation of a heavy quark into hadrons containing a single heavy quark .",
    "they showed that when the fragmentation function is expressed in terms of an appropriate scaling variable , it has a well - defined heavy - quark mass expansion .",
    "specifically , they showed that the fragmentation function @xmath11 at the heavy - quark mass scale has a systematic expansion in inverse powers of @xmath12 when expressed as a function of the scaling variable @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the mass of the heavy hadron , and @xmath5 is its longitudinal momentum fraction relative to the fragmenting heavy quark . in the case of a heavy - light meson , @xmath16 can be interpreted as the ratio of the constituent mass of the light quark to the meson mass . for the pseudoscalar meson @xmath17 and vector meson @xmath18 of the same s - wave multiplet @xmath19 ,",
    "the fragmentation functions at the scale @xmath12 have heavy - quark mass expansions of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 . by heavy - quark spin symmetry ,",
    "the leading terms differ by a spin factor of 3 , while spin splittings first appear at next - to - leading order in the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it was also realized recently that the fragmentation functions for mesons containing a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark can be computed using perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation functions for a @xmath1 to split into the s - wave @xmath24 mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3 were calculated to leading order in @xmath25 in ref .",
    "these fragmentation functions have been used to predict the production rates of the @xmath2 meson at lep and at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the general analysis of jaffe and randall must certainly apply to perturbative qcd fragmentation functions in the limit where the mass of the heavier quark is taken to infinity .",
    "it was verified explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite that the pqcd fragmentation functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 reduce to the forms ( [ dz1 ] ) and ( [ dz2 ] ) with @xmath28 in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "since the pqcd fragmentation functions are consistent with heavy - quark symmetry , they can be used as models for the fragmentation of heavy quarks into heavy - light mesons . in this paper , we show how the leading and next - to - leading terms in the @xmath29 expansions can be calculated directly from hqet .",
    "we then discuss the use of the pqcd fragmentation functions as a phenomenological model for the fragmentation of charm and bottom quarks into heavy - light mesons . as an application of this model",
    ", we consider the fraction @xmath6 of heavy - light mesons that are produced in the vector - meson state .",
    "the hqet lagrangian , including the leading and the @xmath29 terms , is given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 these coefficients are all equal to 1 at the heavy - quark mass scale @xmath32 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath33 can be omitted in calculating physical quantities , because it can be eliminated using a field redefinition involving the equation of motion @xmath34 from the leading term in the lagrangian .",
    "our method for calculating the fragmentation function involves a heavy quark which is off - shell by an amount at least of order @xmath35 . to demonstrate that the @xmath33 term can still be omitted in this case , we keep it in our calculation throughout , and",
    "show that it cancels between the vertex and propagator corrections .    in our calculation",
    ", we need the feynman rules derived from the hqet lagrangian for ( i ) the heavy - quark propagator , including @xmath29 corrections , ( ii ) the heavy - quark - gluon vertex , including @xmath29 corrections , and ( iii ) the propagator for the small component of the dirac field of the heavy quark .",
    "this last feynman rule is needed in our calculation because the fragmenting heavy - quark is off its mass shell .",
    "the feynman rule for a heavy - quark propagator is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the residual 4-momentum of the heavy quark .",
    "the @xmath38 vertex is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the residual 4-momenta of the incoming and outgoing quarks and @xmath42 is the momentum of the gluon .",
    "the feynman rule for the propagator of the small component of the dirac field of the heavy - quark is @xmath43    to calculate the fragmentation functions , we follow the method introduced in refs .",

    "the calculation can be greatly simplified by using the axial gauge with the gauge parameter @xmath60 in the frame where @xmath61 . in this gauge , we need only consider the production of the @xmath46 meson plus @xmath49 through a virtual @xmath47 of momentum @xmath50 .",

    "these contributions to @xmath83 and @xmath97 differ by a spin factor of 3 , as required by heavy - quark spin symmetry .",

    "it is tempting to use the heavy - quark limits of the pqcd fragmentation functions as phenomenological models for the fragmentation of a heavy quark @xmath47 into heavy - light mesons @xmath134 , where @xmath135 or @xmath136 and @xmath137 , or @xmath89 . to next - to - leading order in @xmath29 ,",

    "in addition to @xmath139 and @xmath16 , we must treat @xmath131 as a phenomenological parameter , since , according to ( [ c1-c3 ] ) , it depends on the low - energy scale @xmath140 where perturbation theory breaks down .",

    "thus , if the parameters are determined phenomenologically from data on charm fragmentation into @xmath129 and @xmath132 mesons , then the corresponding parameters for the @xmath142 and @xmath143 mesons can be determined by scaling .",
    "the problem with this model is that unless @xmath116 , either @xmath83 or @xmath97 becomes negative for @xmath5 near 1 .",
    "this unphysical behavior only arises in a region of @xmath5 where the @xmath29 expansion is breaking down , but it makes these fragmentation functions less attractive as a phenomenological model . if we choose @xmath116 to avoid these difficulties , we might as well avoid the @xmath29 expansion altogether and use the complete pqcd fragmentation functions as our model .",
