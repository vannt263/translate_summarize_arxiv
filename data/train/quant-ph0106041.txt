    "linear quantum optical devices have proved to be ideal system for the experimental implementation of several quantum information processing protocols like quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum dense coding  @xcite to mention some .",
    "one of the main limitation of such systems is the difficulty to implement conditional dynamics as photons interfere but hardly interact with each other .",
    "however recently a proposal to implement probabilistic quantum computation  @xcite making use of linear optical devices has been put forward . in this proposal the difficulty to achieve experimentally conditional dynamics is circumvented by making use of auxiliary photons and obtaining a probability of success asymptotically close to one . on the other hand the problem of distinguishing completely photon states secretly chosen from a given set by means of linear devices has been addressed in several recent papers .",
    "in particular the set of bell states has been considered in  @xcite while the set of `` non local without entanglement '' @xcite states has been analyzed in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze the role of auxiliary photons in the problem of identifying the elements of an arbitrary set of orthogonal n - photon states by means of linear optical devices .",
    "we will show that auxiliary photons can not increase our ability to identify which state has been chosen from a given input set .    the experimental setup we will consider is the one already discussed in  @xcite .",
    "suppose that we want to discriminate _",
    "exactly _ @xmath0-photon states over @xmath1 modes , randomly chosen from a known set of @xmath2 states . in our ideal setup",
    "the modes of the input states are mixed with an arbitrary number of auxiliary modes in a `` black box '' consisting of optical linear devices .",
    "the output modes of this box will be linked to the input ones by a unitary transformation @xmath3 .",
    "it has been shown that any such unitary transformations of modes can be obtained by means of linear optical devices  @xcite , like beam splitters and phase shifters . to ensure the largest possible generality in our measurement apparatus we will assume the possibility to perform conditional measurements . in practice",
    "this means what follows : assume that a measurement is made on one selected output mode while the others are kept in a delay loop and that , according to the outcome of the measurement , these modes are fed into a selected further black box , in a cascade setup ( see figure  [ cascade ] ) .",
    "the final assumption we will make is that our detectors have the ability to distinguish the number of incident photons .",
    "although this assumption is unrealistic we have made it in order to guarantee the largest possible generality .    a first strategy to implement a measurement could be to mix the modes by means of linear devices and than perform , with the previously described cascade setup , conditional measurement on the output modes of such device .",
    "however , following @xcite we will adopt a more general strategy .",
    "we will assume to have at our disposal a set of as many additional modes as we like , here indicated with bosonic creation operators @xmath4 , with any number of photons we like and we will assume that these auxiliary modes can be mixed with modes @xmath5 in a black box .    in this scenario we will show that the use of auxiliary photons does not help in increasing the distinguishability of the input states . in other words we will demonstrate that given any two input @xmath0-photon states , they are completely distinguishable in the presence of auxiliary photons only if they are completely distinguishable in the absence of auxiliary photons .",
    "we will show that this is a consequence of the fact that , given a measurement outcome in the selected output mode , the error probability in presence of auxiliary photons has a direct linear relation with the error probability in absence of auxiliary photons .",
    "this assures that auxiliary photons can not improve complete distinguishability .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we will describe our measurement setup and in section iii we will prove our statement . as the mathematics involved is rather tedious to follow some of the details are discussed in appendix .",
    "as described already our measuring apparatus consists of a cascade of `` black boxes '' , in which modes are linearly mixed , and partial measurements , which determine the sequence of unitary mixing .",
    "the first of such black box , denoted by @xmath6 , is made out of linear optical elements and its input and output are a set of bosonic modes .",
    "the joint input modes consist of m `` system '' modes @xmath7 and an arbitrary number of auxiliary modes @xmath8 .",
    "these input modes are unitarily mixed in the box into a set of output modes @xmath9 where the @xmath10 mode is the one on which a measurement will be performed .",
    "the measurement outcome determines the specific unitary mixing that will be performed in next step of the measurement , consisting of a second box @xmath11 .",
    "while the measurement on mode @xmath10 is performed the photons in the remaining @xmath12 modes are kept in a waiting loop .",
    "the whole measurement procedure consists of a cascade of conditional measurements as described above .",
    "the input state of the first block @xmath6 of the measuring apparatus is of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the state randomly chosen from a set of @xmath2 @xmath0-photon states of @xmath1 modes we want to identify and @xmath15 is the state of the auxiliary modes .",
    "such input state @xmath16 can be written as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a polynomial of degree @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a polynomial of arbitrary degree in the @xmath21    the corresponding output state is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are nothing but @xmath20 e @xmath25 written in terms of the creation and annihilation operators at the output of @xmath6 .",
    "we can expand @xmath26 in terms of decreasing powers of @xmath10 as follows    @xmath27    in ( [ espanpsi ] ) @xmath28 is the largest order in @xmath10 for the @xmath29 with @xmath30 and by definition is independent on index @xmath31 ( @xmath32 can be zero for some @xmath31 ) .",
    "analogously @xmath33 is defined as the order in @xmath34 of polynomial @xmath35 .",
    "we can therefore rewrite ( [ output ] ) as    @xmath36    let s suppose now that the number of photons on the selected mode @xmath37 is measured",
    ". if @xmath19 is the outcome of such measurement the ( unormalised ) conditional state of the remaining modes can be we written as    @xmath38    where @xmath39 .",
    "if the input states are to be distinguishable the conditional states @xmath40 _ must be orthogonal for each possible value of @xmath19 _ , i.e.    @xmath41    of particular interest in the following will be the case in which no photon is present in the auxiliary modes . in this case",
    "the distinguishability condition ( [ dist ] ) becomes :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the conditional output state obtained from @xmath44 in the absence of auxiliary photons when @xmath19 photons are measured in mode @xmath37 .",
    "here we have made of use of expression ( [ stcond ] ) .",
    "out of the possible outcomes of the measurement of the number @xmath19 of photons in mode @xmath37 we will concentrate on some particular outcomes , namely those for which @xmath45    the reason of this particular choice will be shortly evident .",
    "now , we define the following @xmath46-dimensional vectors :    @xmath47    whose elements are scalar products of conditional states after the measurement of @xmath48 photons in mode @xmath37 , with and without the auxiliary photons respectively . using this vectors , conditions ( [ distwithout ] )",
    "can be rephrased as :    @xmath49    while a necessary condition for distinguishability with auxiliary photon can be expressed as ( see ( [ dist ] ) ) : @xmath50    the central point of this paper is that , as we will show , vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 are linearly connected through a matrix whose determinant is not vanishing , i.e . @xmath53 the elements of this matrix only depend on the auxiliary photon states and are indedependent on the states of the system .",
    "this implies that conditions ( [ vector : cond : without ] ) and ( [ vector : cond : with ] ) are completely equivalent or , in other words , that _ distinguishability in absence of auxiliary photon is a necessary condition for distinguishability in presence of auxiliary photons . _",
    "in order to demonstrate the previous statement we define the following @xmath46-dimensional vector : @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ distwithout ] ) immediately follows that @xmath55 is linearly connected with @xmath52 .    in this section",
    "we will demonstrate the following    * theorem *    _ given the vectors @xmath51 and @xmath55 , defined in eq  ( [ vectorv ] ) and eq .  ( [ uprime ] ) respectively , it follows that : _",
    "@xmath56    where @xmath57 is a triangular matrix of this form :    @xmath58    with @xmath59    * remark *    _ by definition @xmath60 , being @xmath61 the first non vanishing term of the expansion  ( [ espanaux]).from this follows that _",

    "( [ linear ] ) .    before entering into the details of our proof",
    "we briefly introduce some notation",
    ".    from  ( [ stcond ] ) follows that the scalar product between the ( unormalised ) states @xmath63 obtained after the measurement of @xmath19 photons in mode @xmath37 is @xmath64    with @xmath65 .",

    "it is straightforward to verify by recursion that property 2 implies the following expression for the coefficients @xmath79 :    [ as ] @xmath80 where , and : @xmath81    where the eq .",
    "( [ as : c ] ) is valid for @xmath76 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the above expression gives us a recursive method for calculating all the coefficient of expression ( [ prodn1 ] ) once the auxiliary photons states are known . with the help of eqs .",

    "* @xmath84 s are real numbers .",
    "* @xmath84 s are symmetric in respect to the indices n and m.    it is now possible to cast equation ( [ prodn1 ] ) as a sum whose elements factor in a product of coefficients depending only on system states with coefficients depending only on auxiliary states .",
