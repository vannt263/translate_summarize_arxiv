    "many human cancers today are considered `` chronic diseases '' , with long - term disease trajectories and multiple co - morbidities .",
    "consequently , long - term cancer outcomes may be affected by numerous factors , ranging from obvious patient and treatment characteristics to secular and health care trends that affect treatment policy and practice .",
    "however , the long - term nature of patient and health - care related processes and changing complexity of information can make the analysis of long - term patterns in cancer survivor data sets challenging .",
    "in addition to sparsely observed failure times , these data often exhibit non - proportional effects over time , requiring flexible and computationally efficient statistical methods to characterize the evolving failure hazard .",
    "the motivating problem in this article comes from a set of prostate cancer clinical trials from the radiation therapy oncology group ( rtog ) , which are specifically designed to examine the effects of the length of androgen deprivation ( ad ) therapy on disease - free and overall survival time . as a result of the insight gained from these studies over the years , the short - term benefits of ad therapy have been well - understood to delay the time until prostate cancer recurrence and until death @xcite . in addition , longer - duration ad therapy has proven more beneficial than a shorter - duration therapy @xcite .",
    "however , given that ad treatments can have unpleasant side - effects , clinicians have been reluctant to assign androgen deprivation for longer than necessary .",
    "many questions remain regarding the relationship between the length of ad therapy and long - term outcomes , such as eventual time to recurrence @xcite .",
    "these open questions still exist in part because prostate cancer is generally a slow cancer to progress @xcite . while prostate cancer patients tend to survive longer and",
    "are thus observed over extended periods of time , treatment benefits have been difficult to precisely ascertain due to a multitude of co - morbidities and sparsity of information at long follow - up times .",
    "thus , assessing the long - term benefits of different duration of ad therapy for patients in different risk classes would be of great value to clinical practice and management of prostate cancer patients in general @xcite . gaining insight into recurrence patterns and quantifying the degree and length of long - term benefits over time",
    "would greatly improve the quality of life for men with this disease .",
    "for this reason , the focus of our paper goes beyond integrated summaries such as survival curves and cumulative incidence functions , and concentrates on estimation and inference about the time - dynamic hazard function in the presence of covariates , and the time - evolving predictive probabilities of disease recurrence .",
    "the underlying statistical approach employed in this paper is an extension of the multi - resolution hazard ( mrh ) model , a bayesian semi - parametric hazard rate estimator previously presented and used in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this flexible class of models for time - to - event data is based on the polya tree methodology , and is also similar in spirit to the adaptive piece - wise constant exponential models @xcite .",
    "the mrh parametrization is designed for multi - resolution inference capable of accommodating periods of sparse events and varying smoothness , typical in long - term studies .",
    "in addition , the mrh model accommodates both proportional and non - proportional effects of predictors over time .",
    "the current methodology employs the pruning algorithm presented in @xcite , which performs adaptive and data - driven `` pre - smoothing '' of the hazard rate , via merging of time intervals with similar hazard levels .",
    "pruning has been shown to increase computational efficiency and reduce overall uncertainty in hazard rate estimation in the presence of periods with smooth hazard rate and low event counts @xcite .",
    "all mrh models have been fitted using the ` mrh' r package @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide a short overview of the prostate cancer clinical trials data , and the statistical issues related to these studies with long - term follow - up .",
    "sections 3 and 4 present the corresponding mrh methodology and implementation .",
    "section 5 presents the analysis of biochemical failure in prostate cancer , with comparisons of the mrh approach to a set of alternative models : the cox proportional hazards model , an extended cox model that includes a time - varying treatment effect , a non - proportional hazards weibull parametric model , a semi - parametric bayesian accelerated failure time model , a dependent dirichlet process survival model , and two piece - wise exponential models .",
    "in addition we perform a sensitivity analysis to the priors in the mrh model .",
    "the article concludes with a discussion of the clinical and statistical importance and implications of our findings .",
    "typical prostate treatment involves radiation therapy combined with some form and duration of hormone treatment , which is known as androgen deprivation ( ad ) therapy .",
    "the motivation for the current analysis is the characterization of the hazard rate of time - to - biochemical failure , adjusted for the ( potentially ) time - varying effects of ad therapy and several key covariates , as described below .",
    "the outcome of interest in this analysis , `` biochemical failure '' , is defined according to the phoenix definition as a two - unit rise in prostate specific antigen ( psa ) level following a post - treatment psa nadir @xcite .",
    "prostate specific antigen is a glycoprotein produced almost solely by prostatic epithelial cells , and is a biomarker routinely measured to screen for possible presence of prostate cancer .",
    "men with prostatic diseases ( including cancer ) can have high serum psa levels due to structural changes in the prostate gland as well as to the enhanced production of psa ; therefore , elevated levels have long been used as a possible indication of the presence of prostate cancer , including residual or recurrent disease after treatment @xcite .",
    "although recent studies question psa as a screening method for initial prostate cancer diagnoses @xcite , the examination of the rise in psa levels post - cancer treatment is still considered by many to be a useful clinical tool for assessing the risk or presence of prostate cancer recurrence .",
    "the rises in psa levels can lead to what is termed  biochemical failure \" , which in itself is not currently considered a clinical endpoint .",
    "however , biochemical failure is thought to importantly portend advancing ( and possibly sub - clinical ) disease .",
    "prostate cancer mortality risk might also be affected by patterns in biochemical failures @xcite over time . however , because of its lack of direct clinical consequences , its use as a primary endpoint in clinical trials has been controversial .",
    "nonetheless , characterization of the biochemical failure hazard over time , particularly within different patient subgroups defined by disease characteristics or treatment regimens , would provide a strong foundation for determining how this endpoint may relate to the levels of risk for clinical recurrence and death . a better understanding of these recurrence patterns over time could be of great value for clinical management , design of clinical trials , and biologic insights into prostate cancer progression in different population subgroups .",
    "the data we use to analyze biochemical failure hazard come from the radiation therapy oncology group ( rtog ) , which is a national clinical cooperative group that has been funded by the national cancer institute ( nci ) since 1968 in an effort to increase survival and improve the quality of life for cancer patients .",
    "the group consists of both clinical and laboratory investigators from over 360 institutions across the united states and canada and includes in its membership nearly 90% of all nci - designated comprehensive and clinical cancer centers .",
    "the specific rtog clinical trial we examine in this paper is rtog 92 - 02 , which is part of a series of rtog clinical trials conducted from the 1980s to the present .",
    "these rich studies provide a wealth of data sources for studying the  natural history \" of prostate cancer as it is presently defined and managed clinically .",
    "rtog 92 - 02 was a multi - center study , designed with the primary objective of evaluating the effectiveness of androgen deprivation therapy on prostate cancer disease progression and survival . between 1992 and 1995 , 1,521 participants with locally advanced high risk prostate cancer were accrued in over 200 treatment centers across the country . during the trial",
    ", all patients received 4 months of androgen deprivation ( ad ) therapy including goserelin and flutamide , in addition to external beam radiation therapy .",
    "subjects were then randomized to either no further ad therapy ( the `` + 0 m ad group '' ) , or an additional 24 months of goserelin ( the `` + 24 m ad group '' ) using the treatment allocation scheme described by @xcite , and were stratified according to stage , pretreatment psa , grade , and nodal status .",
    "given rtog s long history of high quality , well - randomized clinical trials with strictly executed protocols in each institution @xcite , analyses of the pooled data ( without considering center heterogeneity ) have been dominant in previous analyses of these trials ( for example , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , and our analysis here follows suit .",
    "further protocol details and study description can also be found in @xcite and @xcite .    for each patient enrolled ,",
    "several measures of aggressiveness and severity of the original cancer were recorded at baseline : the gleason score , t - stage of the tumor , and the psa level at diagnosis . the gleason score is assigned by a pathologist after microscopic examination of a tumor biopsy . based on the degree to which the prostate cells have become altered , a gleason score ranging from 2 - 10 is assigned , with scores between 2 and 4 indicating almost normal cells that pose little danger , and scores above 8 indicating very abnormal cells and a cancer that could be aggressive @xcite .    the american joint committee on cancer ( ajcc ) staging criteria is used to assign the tumor a t - stage , which indicates the extent that the primary tumor has spread .",
    "( in this analysis , we omit the ` n ' and ` m ' components of ajcc staging , as they are only applicable to non - localized cancer cases ) . because all patients in the rtog 92 - 02 trial were selected as `` high - risk '' by pre - specified criteria @xcite , our data set only contains men with tumors of stage two ( t2 ) through four ( t4 ) .",
    "stage t2 indicates that the tumor can be felt during a physical examination , but has not spread outside the prostate , stage t3 indicates that the tumor has spread throughout the prostate ( or the  prostatic capsule \" ) , and stage t4 indicates the tumor has spread beyond the prostate @xcite .    in conjunction with the gleason score and the t - stage , psa levels",
    "at the time of diagnosis are an important component of prostate cancer staging , with very high levels frequently thought to be associated with a more severe form of prostate cancer .",
    "since the gleason score , t - stage , and psa level are all important components of the cancer severity at the time of diagnosis , they , in addition to the age at diagnosis , will be considered as predictors in the biochemical failure analysis .",
    "the final data set considered in this analysis comprises 1,421 subjects , after the removal of 100 subjects with missing gleason scores .",
    "of those 1,421 subjects , 705 men ( 49.6% ) received no additional ad therapy ( were placed in the `` + 0 m ad therapy '' group ) and 716 men ( 50.4% ) received additional 24 months of ad therapy ( the `` + 24 m ad therapy '' group ) .",
    "the sample median time to biochemical failure is 4.9 years ( sd = 3.9 , range = 0.03 - 13.65 ) .",
    "biochemical failure was observed for 50.4% of the patients before the end of the study period .",
    "the sample median age at baseline was 70 years ( sd = 6.5 , range = 43 - 88 ) .",

    ".sample characteristics of 1,421 patients in the final rtog 92 - 02 trial data set , by treatment group , with age at diagnosis in 10-year increments , gleason scores categorized by grade , and t - stage categorized into levels 2 - 4 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "this paper illustrates how different modeling and smoothing assumptions effect the estimate of the time - varying treatment effect .",
    "we present results from a suite of models ranging from parametric to non - parametric , and demonstrate that different assumptions can lead to very smooth , flat log - hazard ratio estimates ( such as those in the nph weibull model ) to estimates which vary more over time ( such as those in the mrh , pe , and the ddp survival model ) .",
    "additionally , the different models exhibited a high degree of variability in the goodness - of - fit measure and the penalized goodness of fit criteria .",
    "we have also shown how choosing different values of @xmath0 gives the mrh model the flexibility to perform similarly to other models , ranging from the piece - wise exponential to the parametric weibull model .",
    "the npmrh model allows for multiple changes in the treatment effects over time , with multiple increases and decreases over the length of a study period .",
    "other patient and disease characteristic covariate effects were similar to those previously seen in this trial @xcite and expected based on the effects of these factors in other studies .",
    "men with higher gleason scores had greater hazard of biochemical failure , although this difference was statistically significant only for those with gleason scores of 8 or more .",
    "in addition , those with more advanced tumor stage ( t - stage 3 or 4 ) or with higher psa level at diagnosis also had a higher hazard rate of biochemical failure .",
    "men who were older at diagnosis were found to have a lower hazard rate of biochemical failure , although this may be still partly confounded with the censoring patterns in older patients and warrants further exploration .    additionally , the presented analysis has allowed insight into the effects of the duration of ad therapy on biochemical failure , and in particular into how the effects of ad therapy changed throughout the course of the study .",
    "while it was already apparent that 24 months of additional ad therapy is beneficial ( relative to the 0 additional months of ad therapy ) in that it prolongs the time until biochemical failure and other failure endpoints @xcite , our investigation has revealed additional insights . during and immediately after active therapy",
    ", the peak in the hazard rate around two years is much flatter for the + 24 m treatment group .",
    "in addition , the + 24 month group continued to have a lower hazard rate throughout most of the observation period ( over 10 years ) , although smaller due to the non - proportionality of the treatment effect .",
    "thus , it does appear that the benefits of the additional months of ad therapy , while diminishing over time , are persistent , which suggests that failure in the longer ad duration group are not simply deferred but possibly avoided . on the other hand , for those patients who received short ad therapy and did not fail early or during the peak period of failures , their late term prognosis is nearly as favorable as those who underwent long duration ad .",
    "thus , until such patients can be prospectively identified , the long ad approach would seem to be preferred for all patients . to this end",
    ", we also illustrate how the bayesian approach can allow the use of posterior predictive failure probabilities , such as in figure [ fig : survcurvecomparison ] , as aids in clinical contexts .",
    "the foundation of the mrh method is a tree - like wavelet - based multi - resolution prior on the hazard function , chosen conveniently to allow scalability and consistency across different time scales ( i.e minutes , weeks , years , etc ) .",
    "it uses a piece - wise constant approximation of the hazard function over @xmath1 time intervals , parametrized by a set of hazard increments @xmath2 . here , each @xmath3 represents the aggregated hazard rate over the @xmath4 time interval , ranging from @xmath5 . in the standard survival analysis notation , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hazard rate at time @xmath8 .    to facilitate the recursive diadic partition of the multiresolution tree , we assume that @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath10 is an integer , set large enough to achieve the desired time resolution for the hazard rate .",
    "@xmath10 can also be chosen using model selection criteria or clinical input , as in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "note that the cumulative hazard , @xmath11 , is equal to the sum of all @xmath12 hazard increments @xmath13 .",
    "the model then recursively splits @xmath11 at different branches via the  split parameters \" @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath15 is recursively defined as @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 split parameters , each between 0 and 1 , guide the shape of the _ a priori _ hazard rate over time ( figure [ fig : mrhfig ] ) .",
    "the complete hazard rate prior specification is obtained via priors placed on all tree parameters : a gamma(@xmath20 ) prior is placed on the cumulative hazard @xmath11 , and beta prior on each split parameter @xmath19 , @xmath21 . for example , the priors for @xmath11 and @xmath19 in 3-level mrh model ( @xmath22 ) would be : @xmath23 under this parametrization , the prior distribution of each hazard increment is governed by these beta and gamma distributions . in particular , their prior expectations depend on the hyperparameters of the beta and gamma priors  for example , in the above 3-level model @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , these mrh hyperparameters control the correlation between the hazard increments @xmath3 , and thus directly relate to the smoothness of the multiresolution prior , as shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this parametrization also insures the self - consistency of the mrh prior at multiple resolutions @xcite .    .",
    "the first figure ( upper left ) shows the mean mrh rate at the first level ( @xmath25 ) , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 prior mean of 0.76 reflects the higher hazard during the first time interval .",
    "the second figure ( upper right ) shows the mean mrh rate at the second level ( @xmath29 ) , with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 derived analogously .",
    "the third figure ( lower left ) , shows the mean mrh rate at the third level ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the last figure ( lower right ) , shows the mean mrh rate for @xmath34 , which closely matches the true hazard rate . in all the figures ,",
    "the mean mrh rates for the previous resolutions are shown in grey , @xmath35 are shown in green , and @xmath36 in red .",
    "the advantage of the mrh model is its  self - consistency \" under aggregation @xcite , which means that the prior specification at any level @xmath37 is independent of the ultimate level @xmath10 .",
    "this property allows the hazard rate to be examined at multiple resolutions in a consistent manner.,width=480 ]      the mrh prior resolution is chosen as a compromise between the desire for detail in the hazard rate , and the amount of data . as the resolution increases ( and the number of time intervals increases ) ,",
    "observed failure counts within each bin will decrease .",
    "while useful for revealing detailed patterns , a large number of intervals ( and consequently , a large number of model parameters ) will generally require longer computing times and result in estimators with lower statistical efficiency @xcite .",
    "`` pruning '' , as used in @xcite , is a data - driven pre - processing technique , which combines consecutive @xmath38s that are statistically similar ( and happens frequently with periods of low failure counts ) .",
    "the technique increases the computational efficiency by decreasing the parameter dimension _ a priori _ , which can greatly speed up analyses of non - proportional hazards .",
    "the pruning method thus changes the overall time resolution of the mrh prior , keeping the higher resolution during the periods of high event counts , and lower resolution during periods of low event counts .",
    "the mrh pruning technique has been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "briefly , pruning starts with the full mrh tree prior , and merges adjacent bins that are constructed via the same split parameter , @xmath19 , when the hazard increments in these two bins ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are statistically similar .",
    "this is inferred by testing the hypothesis @xmath41 against the alternative @xmath42 , with a pre - set type i error @xmath43 , for each split parameter @xmath19 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "if the null hypothesis is not rejected , that split @xmath19 is set to @xmath45 and the adjacent hazard increments are considered equal and the time bins declared `` fused '' . the hypothesis testing can be applied to all @xmath10 levels of the tree or just a higher resolution subset of the tree . while the pruning is expected to reduce the amount hazard rate detail discovered by the mrh method , the posterior hazard rate estimator is shown to have lower risk compared to its equivalent from the non - pruned model @xcite .",
    "the estimation algorithm is performed two steps : the pruning step and the gibbs sampler routine .",
    "the details are listed below .",
    "the pruning step is run only once for each of the @xmath46 hazard rates at the beginning of the algorithm as a pre - processing step in order to finalize the mrh tree priors .",
