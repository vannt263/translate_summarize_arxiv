    "it is believed that the most promising candidate for the ultimate unified theory is superstring theory .",
    "the effective action stemming from superstring theory contains higher order curvature terms .",
    "indeed , in four dimensions , the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term appears as a one - loop string correction  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this fact , einstein - scalar - gauss - bonnet theory is studied and non - singular cosmological solutions are found  @xcite .",
    "the solutions have super inflation phase where the hubble parameter increases , which indicates the violation of the weak energy condition .",
    "subsequently , cosmological perturbations in this background are investigated  @xcite . in the process , the so - called gradient instability is found for the first time in @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "this is known as a useful criterion for model selections in various extension of general relativity  @xcite . by applying this criterion ,",
    "it has been shown the non - singular solutions are unstable in general because of the violation of the weak energy condition  @xcite .    recently , kanti et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the einstein - scalar - gauss - bonnet theory with a quadratic coupling function and found that the theory contains inflationary solutions where de sitter phase possesses a natural exit mechanism and are replaced by linearly expanding milne phases .",
    "remarkably , there is no inflaton potential in this model .",
    "they also claimed that only the quadratic coupling leads to these results among monomial coupling functions . in this sense , the model is simple and unique .",
    "hence , it is worth investigating the inflationary scenario , named the gauss - bonnet inflation .    in order for this gb inflation to be viable",
    ", its predictions must be compatible with current observational data  @xcite .",
    "hence , we need to calculate perturbations and compare its predictions with observations . first , we calculate tensor perturbations in the inflationary background following previous results  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we find the gradient instability in tensor perturbations in the gb inflation .",
    "hence , the model is not viable phenomenologically .",
    "we also extend this result to more general coupling functions and establish the no - go theorem for gb inflation without an inflaton potential .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the cosmological inflationary solutions obtained by kanti et al .  @xcite . in section iii , we numerically examine the dynamics of tensor perturbations and find the instability of gb inflation . in section iv , we prove a no - go theorem for gb inflation without an inflaton potential . as a byproduct , we also present the stability condition for gb inflation with an inflaton potential .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we review the main results of the papers  @xcite . in particular , we show there exists a quasi - de sitter phase in the einstein - scalar - gauss - bonnet theory with a quadratic coupling function in spite of absence of an inflaton potential .",
    "the action considered there is gb gravity with a scalar field @xmath0 which coupled non - minimally with a coupling function @xmath1 to gravity via the gb term @xmath2 @xmath3.\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the gravitational coupling constant , @xmath5 is a determinant of the metric @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the ricci scalar , and the gb term is given by @xmath8 note that there is no inflaton potential @xmath9 .",
    "the variation of this action with respect to the metric tensor and scalar field give us the field equations , @xmath10 and @xmath11+\\frac{1}{8 }   f ' r_{gb}^2 = 0 \\ , \\ ] ] where we defined @xmath12 , @xmath13 is set to unity and @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15\\alpha}+2g_{\\alpha[\\nu}r_{\\beta]\\mu}+rg_{\\mu[\\nu}g_{\\beta]\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    for a homogeneous and isotropic flat spacetime , the metric is described by a scale factor @xmath16 as @xmath17 now , the explicit form of the field equations reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hubble parameter and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to time .    to be concrete , we need to specify the function @xmath1 .",
    "kanti et al .",
    "@xcite found the quadratic coupling function @xmath20 with a coupling constant @xmath21 gives rise to the inflationary solutions . in the early time , that is , in the strong gravity regime , the gb term dominates over the ricci scalar term .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of the universe does not show any significant change as long as the scalar field takes very large values or @xmath21 takes a very large value even if we neglect the ricci term .",
    "therefore , we will neglect the ricci term for a moment . with this approximation , the unity terms inside of brackets in equation ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "thus , we obtain the equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 . from now on ,",
    "we assume @xmath24 .",
    "apparently , there exists a solution with @xmath25 . for this case ,",
    "eq.([5 ] ) can be integrated as @xmath26 from the solution ( [ 6a ] ) , we clearly see inflation can happen due to the gb term .",
    "moreover , the scalar field can be solved as @xmath27     is plotted as a function of time for various @xmath28.,width=566 ]    even for general cases , we can analytically integrate eq.([5 ] ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant of integration .",
    "as you can see , as the universe expands , the hubble parameter decreases .",
    "hence , we have to tune @xmath31 so that inflation occurs for a sufficiently long time . in this case",
    ", the scale factor can be obtained by analytically solving eq.([h_sol ] ) using the change of a variable @xmath32 .",
    "the resultant solution is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant of integration .",
    "because of the implicit solution for the scale factor @xmath35 in equation ( [ 6c ] ) , the explicit solution for scalar field can not be found explicitly as a function of time . yet",
    ", we can obtain it as a function of the scale factor , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is another constant of integration . from this equation",
    ", we can see that the scalar field initially decreases . in the regime @xmath38",
    ", however , the scalar field becomes constant .",
    "we have also numerically solved eqs.([2 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) , and ( [ 4 ] ) without any approximation .",
    "the time evolution of the scale factor in the term of the number of e - foldings , @xmath39 is plotted in fig.([fig : plotofeinstein - scalar - gauss - bonnettheory(2 ) ] ) . here",
    "you can see inflationary behavior and the subsequent decelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "notice that the initial inflationary period can be elongated by making @xmath40 ( or @xmath21 ) large .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that there exists inflation without an inflaton potential .",
    "given the inflationary background , the next step is to calculate perturbations and check if the model is compatible with observational data .",
    "unfortunately , however , we will see the instability of the gauss - bonnet inflation .    here ,",
    "we begin with tensor perturbations defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 . for the metric ( [ 6 ] )",

    "note that the system contains ghost if @xmath47 .",
    "since the existence of ghost implies that the model is pathological , we must avoid this possibility . from eq .",
    "( [ acten ] ) , we can see that the stability of the system is determined by the last term , while the second term is a friction term .",
    "the model is stable for tensor perturbation when squared the effective speed of sound is positive @xmath48 therefore , we can check the stability of tensor perturbations of the model by checking the value of @xmath49 . from the equations of motion ( [ 2 ] ) to ( [ 4 ] ) , we can get the time evolution for @xmath49 for several @xmath21 values as can be seen in fig.[fig : plotstability ] . because @xmath49 is negative during inflation",
    ", we can conclude that the system is unstable under tensor perturbations .    in order to see the instability of the system more explicitly",
    ", we numerically solved the time evolution of the tensor perturbations .",

    "therefore , the system is unstable under tensor perturbations .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that the instability of gb theory for the specific coupling function @xmath51 . in this section",

    "the field equations for this action are similar to eqs.([2])-([4 ] ) .",

    "suppose that quasi - de sitter inflation occurs for some coupling function @xmath1 .",
    "because of the quasi - de sitter inflation , the slow roll parameter satisfies the condition @xmath64",
    ". hence , we always have the inequality @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the condition ( [ main ] ) is satisfied only for the models @xmath66 .",
    "however , that implies the existence of the ghost .",
    "namely , inflationary solutions must be unstable or contain ghost . in any case , the model is not phenomenologically allowed .",
    "thus , we proved a no - go theorem for gb inflation without an inflaton potential .",
    "therefore , the cosmological model with the gb term without inflaton potential can not be a viable model .",
    "even when an inflaton potential , @xmath67 , is included , the stability condition ( [ main ] ) still remains useful .",
    "indeed , it can be used to select viable models .",
    "in fact , because of the variety of the form of potential function , it is possible to find the stable cosmological model with the gb term .",
    "we studied einstein - scalar - gauss - bonnet theory with non - minimal coupling function .",
    "in particular , we focussed on inflation without an inflaton potential . in this model , in the case of quadratic coupling , inflation occurs and possess a natural exit mechanism .",
    "the scenario is attractive because of the simple set - up .",
    "this motivated us to examine perturbative stability of the inflationary background solutions .",
    "we numerically solved the dynamics of tensor perturbations and found the gradient instability  @xcite in tensor perturbations in the inflationary model .",
    "we further extended this result and proved the no - go theorem for the gb inflation without an inflaton potential .",
    "thus , we have shown that the gb inflation without an inflaton potential is not phenomenologically viable .",
    "of course , if we incorporate an inflaton potential into the model , there are stable inflationary solutions  @xcite .",
    "we have also given the stability criterion for this class of models .",
    "for stable models , we can discuss phenomenological predictions and compare them with observational data .",
    "in fact , at high energy , it is natural to consider gauss - bonnet term as a correction  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is still intriguing to study einstein - scalar - gauss - bonnet theory in the cosmological context .",
