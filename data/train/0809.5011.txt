    "the theory of brownian motion in its formulation due to langevin @xcite assumes that particles are subject to stochastic influences and external forces , the latter making them move according to the potential @xmath0 , which models their environmental landscape .",
    "stochastic equations of motion are @xmath1 including a friction term with friction constant @xmath2 , the force of the external potential @xmath3 and the random force @xmath4 , which has infinite variance per definition .",
    "particles are considered to be without an inner structure , just driven by the external potential and the noise , without any capability of changing their dynamics by themselves .",
    "if studying the complex motion e.g.  of bacteria or even higher developed organisms , this simple assumption of particles reacting to a prescribed potential landscape can not explain the widely observed emergent phenomena arising in such systems .",
    "a number of models were proposed , including some kind of ` self driven motion ' of particles , which should account for the lack of complex behavior dynamics .",
    "apart from just postulating such additional effects , the theory of active brownian particles @xcite explains the origin of this ` self - motion ' by imposing an additional _ internal _ degree of freedom , called ` internal energy ' @xmath5 .",
    "this energy can be increased by taking up external energy ( ` food ' ) from the environment and be transformed into kinetic energy of the particle , i.e. the particle is ` active ' in the sense that it is able to convert its internal energy into energy of motion .",
    "this model has served to describe animal mobility in general @xcite and was able to make quantitative statements about emergent self - organized properties in the collective behavior of many particle systems , e.g.  swarms @xcite .    after reviewing some fundamental aspects of the original theory",
    ", we propose a canonical version of active brownian motion by allowing to convert internal energy into the full mechanical energy of the particle . in case of stationary internal energies",
    "our generalized theory defines active brownian motion as a canonical dissipative system also with interactions , which was not possible in former models .",
    "interacting active brownian particles were studied intensively @xcite , recent contributions included dissipative toda and morse ",
    "systems @xcite . in our formalism",
    ", however , we are able to study interacting active brownian motion as a _",
    "canonical _ dissipative system .",
    "the original formulations of active brownian motion rarely discuss nonequilibrium dynamics . in most applications ,",
    "only stationary solutions are present , which implies constant internal energies for all times .",
    "we will show how active brownian motion in its fully coupled form contains rich nonequilibrium structures , too .",
    "the main idea of active brownian motion is to ascribe an additional , so called ` internal ' energy @xmath5 @xcite to brownian particles .",
    "stochastic dynamics for the motion of an active particle in @xmath6 dimensions with degrees of freedom @xmath7 and associated momenta @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 read @xcite : @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "noise correlations are @xmath17 all constants @xmath18 , as well as @xmath19 are assumed to be positive . calculating the total time derivative of the hamiltonian in the deterministic case yields @xmath20 which allows us to interpret the implications of internal energy dynamics : the first term models the mechanical energy loss by friction due to the surrounding media , whereas the second term shows the possibility of an energy increase via the coupling of kinetic energy to the internal energy .",
    "if the internal energy becomes stationary after some time ( @xmath21 ) , it can be expressed as a function of the kinetic energy : @xmath22 which implies @xmath23 where @xmath24 . the equation above defines a model of brownian motion in media of nonlinear friction .",
    "active brownian particles with stationary internal energies therefore move like in a medium with nonlinear friction function @xmath25 .",
    "relaxation of the internal energy to a stationary value therefore results in changing the original friction of the medium to an effective friction .",
    "the following section will show that equilibrium internal energies will have completely different effects in the case when @xmath5 is coupled to the potential energy @xmath0 , instead of coupling it to @xmath26 , as is usually done . setting @xmath21",
    "will then result in changing the original potential to an _ _ effective one .",
    "active brownian motion in its original formulation imposes a coupling of the internal to the kinetic energy , given by equation ( [ hui ] ) , in which @xmath5 is multiplied by @xmath26 .",
    "the most natural and simplest way to extend this balance equation to the case of potential couplings would be to multiply @xmath5 with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , in equation ( [ eq : kafka ] ) , it should appear the product between the internal energy and the @xmath27-gradient of @xmath28 ( and not the @xmath29-gradient as in the original case ) .",
    "especially when considering many particle systems like swarms , exchanges between internal and potential energies seem physically intriguing : swarm particles generate their interaction potentials mutually due to exchange of internal energy ; the internal energy of one particle has effects on its interaction with all the other particles . in the present paper",
    "we study the dynamics of a single particle only , but we already introduce its generalized couplings for the internal energy .",
    "we have already given stochastic differential equations for this set - up in configuration space @xcite .",
    "stochastic dynamics in phase space equivalently read : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 with @xmath15 and @xmath33 .",
    "the system is constructed in complete analogy to the original theory of active brownian motion , but with interchanging the role of @xmath29 and @xmath27 , resp .",

    "[ sec : orig ] , which leads to @xmath34 discussions about the interpretation of such conservation laws can be found in the standard textbook @xcite .",
    "one remarkable feature is the emergence of effective potentials in the time region of stationary internal energy , i.e. @xmath21 ; hence @xmath35 and thus @xmath36 @xmath37 which are formally the well known equations for the motion of a brownian particle in media of linear friction , but with an effective hamiltonian @xmath38 its time evolution in the deterministic case is given by @xmath39 couplings of @xmath5 to the potential energy therefore manifest themselves by changing the original potential to an effective one .",
    "stationary internal energies in classical active brownian motion describe systems of a particle moving with an effective nonlinear friction @xmath25 , whereas in the case of internal energy coupled to @xmath0 , the arising effect lies in changing the original potential to an effective one @xmath40",
    ". the crucial role of this effective potential can be seen by numerical investigations of equations ( [ eq : lop])-([sop ] ) for specific forms of @xmath0 : under the influence of harmonic forces @xmath41 , the motion of one particle in two dimensions is given by @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where a noise strength factor @xmath46 was introduced via the substitution @xmath47 .",

    "figure [ fig : diffusion circle ] shows the simulated behavior of a particle subject to the equations given above .",
    "two dimensional motion of an active particle under the influence of harmonic forces in the @xmath48-plane , subject to equations ( [ eq : lop])-([sop ] ) with all parameters chosen to be equal to one except @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "initial conditions are @xmath52 . ]    out of its initial conditions , the particle drops onto a circle and then diffuses in no preferred direction , until the whole ring area is filled with trajectories .",
    "this random motion on a ring can be explained by referring to the structure of the effective potential , which for the harmonic example reads @xmath53 in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath54 .",
    "the minima of @xmath55 are found to be at all radial distances @xmath56 which is exactly the radius of the circle seen in figure [ fig : diffusion circle ] . in the case of no coupling to an internal energy ( @xmath57 ) , the particle would directly fall into the minimum of the external potential ( which is at @xmath58 ) , and no diffusion in any direction would be present .",
    "positive values of @xmath59 can be realized for critical values of the coupling parameter @xmath60 , namely if @xmath61 .",
    "active brownian particles with a coupling of @xmath5 to the potential energy feel a different landscape than the prescribed one , i.e.  an _ effective _ environment , which is then searched for minimum areas . the internal energy effect in our present example results in trapping the particle not at the origin , but on a circle of a given radius @xmath62 .",
    "this stationary state of noise - induced wandering in the valley of minima is immediately present after the internal energy has finally relaxed to its constant value @xmath63 , given by equation ( [ stationary ] ) . in the minimum region @xmath62 , so the stationary value of the internal energy can be calculated directly : @xmath64 figure [ fig : internal - energy - evolution ] shows the relaxation of @xmath5 to the stationary value @xmath63 .",
    "after initial oscillations it equilibrates to a constant value ( which is then slightly disturbed by the noise influences ) .     internal energy evolution in time corresponding to the parameter setup given in figure [ fig : diffusion circle ] .",
    "the stationary value of @xmath5 can be calculated from equation ( [ e0 ] ) : @xmath65 . ]",
    "another remarkable feature of coupling the internal energy to the potential is that equilibrium distributions can be calculated _",
    "exactly_. the standard form of stochastic differential equations ( [ loee ] ) & ( [ eloo ] ) has the following well - known stationary solution of the corresponding fokker planck equation : @xmath66 which reduces to @xmath67 for the distribution in configuration space , after performing the gaussian momentum integral .",
    "this is an exact equilibrium solution of our nonlinear stochastic process .",
    "former models of active brownian motion had to rely on specific approximation methods , when studying equilibrium solutions of the corresponding fokker planck equation @xcite .",
    "combining the so far separately imposed couplings to the kinetic , resp .  the potential energy , stochastic dynamics are in full generality : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 with @xmath15 and @xmath33 , @xmath16 .",
    "recently another generalized model for internal energy dynamics was introduced by zhang et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "whereas in their paper the coupling of internal energy to position and velocity is generated via an arbitrary function of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , our coupling mechanism is motivated from the idea of exchange between internal and the full mechanical energy .",
    "the time differential of the hamiltonian in the deterministic case reads @xmath73 if the internal energy equilibrates after some time , its stationary value would be @xmath74 so that dynamics reduce to @xmath75 @xmath76 with the two dissipation functions @xmath77 stochastic equations for active brownian motion now truly define a _ canonical _ system , in the sense that all parts of the dynamics are completely given by the hamiltonian function , which was not the case for separate couplings to @xmath26 or @xmath0 .",
    "only when we consider free particles ( @xmath78 ) , so that in equation ( [ anders ] ) @xmath79 , active brownian motion in its original sense is a canonical system . when coupling the internal energy to the hamiltonian , also the general case of active brownian particles _ with _ interactions ( i.e.  with a potential ) represents a canonical dissipative system .",
    "the method of coupling @xmath5 to the full mechanical energy leads to a novel type of canonical dissipative system , which has a more complex dissipative behavior and is more general than those ones which currently exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "in this section , we investigate equilibrium solutions of canonical active brownian motion and its possible bifurcation scenarios .",
    "bifurcation theory studies the qualitative change of solutions for a dynamical system when parameters are varied .",
    "_ static _ bifurcations are present , e.g. , when for some critical parameter values , two equilibrium points become stable while another one loses its stability .",
    "apart from dealing only with stationary solutions , _ dynamic _ bifurcations describe how equilibrium points can bifurcate into nonequilibrium orbits , e.g.  limit cycles .",
    "we will encounter both of these bifurcation scenarios in canonical active brownian motion .",
    "special attention is given to nonequilibrium solutions , i.e.  situations in which @xmath80 .",
    "bifurcations of active brownian motion for some special case of generalized internal energy dynamics were studied also in @xcite . however , no bifurcation analysis for velocity _ and _ space dependent internal energy equations were given , nor was considered the case of an external harmonic potential .",
    "we will investigate the non - equilibrium behavior of active brownian motion , when both kinetic _ and _ potential energy coupling is present .",
    "for the following explicit calculations , we assume the harmonic external potential @xmath81 .",
    "stochastic differential equations ( [ malone one])-([malone ] ) then read @xmath82 @xmath83 where we have separated the couplings of @xmath5 to the kinetic and the potential energy for later analysis of special cases .",
    "equilibria in one dimension for the deterministic case are @xmath84 @xmath85 stability conditions of these points are obtained by linearizing the system . in equations ( [ eq : one dim ] ) & ( [ eq : one dim 2 ] )",
    ", we make the shift @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , neglecting any terms of order higher than one .",
    "then dynamics are given only by the jacobian matrix , whose eigenvalues can be studied for each of the three equilibria separately . for equilibrium ( [ qpe : e1 ] ) , the eigenvalues of the jacobian are @xmath89 the real parts of all @xmath90 s are negative if @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "figure [ fig : traj1 ] shows a trajectory in phase space @xmath93 approaching equilibrium ( [ qpe : e1 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues for equilibria ( [ qpe : e2 ] ) are not accessible so easily , so we follow the routh - hurwitz theorem @xcite , which allows one to calculate stability regions by analyzing only the characteristic equation of the jacobian , without any need for solving it",
