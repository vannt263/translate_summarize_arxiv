    "the experimental realization of degenerate bose gases in tight effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) traps @xcite in the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime @xcite has rekindled interest to the tg model , which , being well known for a long time , was assumed to have a theoretical value only ( for a review see @xcite ) . in the tg state , bosons emulate the pauli exclusion principle , as a result of the hard - core repulsion , rather than as a manifestation of the quantum statistics .",
    "one of recent trends in this field is the application of mean - field - like approaches to the description of macroscopic dynamics of tg gases @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this approach is the use of a formal analogy between hydrodynamic equations for degenerate fermi gases and bose gases in the tg phase .",
    "this analogy has led to the derivation of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with the local quintic repulsive nonlinearity for the  wave function \" of the tg gas @xcite . in the framework of the quintic nlse ,",
    "the existence of dark solitons was predicted @xcite , and dynamics of dark solitons was investigated @xcite .",
    "bright solitons of the gap type in the same model equation including a periodic optical - lattice ( ol ) potential have been reported too , although in different contexts , such as a phenomenological description of degenerate fermi gases and bcs superfluids , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the quasi - mean - field approach relies on the physically plausible assumption that the spatial scale of variations of the gas density is much larger than the healing length . under this condition ,",
    "the effective nlse allows one to approximate collective oscillations of the tg gas in a harmonic trap .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated that excitation frequencies derived from the fermionic hydrodynamic equations , and from the quintic nlse agree within a few percent @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of this line of research is to consider gases with long - range dipole - dipolar ( dd ) interactions between atoms .",
    "some bosonic atoms , such as @xmath0cr , feature a significant permanent magnetic dipole moment ( @xmath1 , in the case of chromium ) .",
    "the creation of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) made of @xmath0cr , and various experiments in that quantum gas have been reported @xcite .",
    "a gas of lics molecules carrying a permanent electric dipole moment was also recently made available to experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , atoms may be polarized by an external dc electric field @xcite .",
    "the nonlocal character of the dd interactions may drastically modify properties of the quantum gas  first of all , changing the character of the collapse in it @xcite .",
    "further , stable isotropic @xcite and anisotropic @xcite",
    "2d solitons have been predicted in the 2d dipolar bec , whereas such localized states are always unstable in the same model with local interactions @xcite .",
    "recently , families of 1d matter - wave solitons in a bose - einstein condensate supported by the competition of contact and dipole - dipole interactions of opposite signs were predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and 1d discrete solitons corresponding to the limit case of the dipolar condensate trapped in a very deep ol ( i.e. , solutions to the discrete nlse with the long - range dd interactions between lattice sites ) were found too @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to mention that qualitatively similar effects may be induced by the nonlocal nonlinearity in models of optical media @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study localized structures in the model of a 1d bose gases supported by competing nonlocal attractive cubic ( dd ) and local repulsive quintic ( contact ) nonlinearities , using numerical simulations of the nlse containing this combination of the nonlinear terms . besides the cold bosons in the tg regime",
    ", this model may apply ( at least , at the phenomenological level @xcite ) to nearly-1d degenerate fermi gases with dd interactions between atoms .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model , present typical shapes of solitons expected in the tg dipolar gas , and study their stability in direct simulations . in section iii",
    "we demonstrate , via numerical experiments , dynamics predicted by the model with a _ variable _ ( time - dependent ) strength of the dd interactions , including formation of dark solitons on top of a broad bright soliton , splitting of the soliton , and expansion of the tg gas , in cases when the dd interaction is ramped up , or switched off . in section iv , we report various results of interactions and collisions between two solitons .",
    "section v concludes the paper .",
    "in accordance with what was said above , we start with the quintic nlse introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we add the nonlocal cubic term accounting for the dd interaction : @xmath2 is the total number of atoms , and @xmath3 is the atomic dipole moment , the wave function being subject to the normalization condition , @xmath4 equation ( [ quint ] ) is expected to be valid for large number of atoms @xmath5 , typically @xmath6 , when oscillations of the matter - wave density along the chain of strongly interacting bosons confined to a tight waveguide are essentially suppressed . on the other hand , the bose - fermi mapping , which underlies the solution of the tg model @xcite , may hold in the present situation provided that the dipolar attraction between atoms is weaker than the contact ( hard - core ) repulsion .",
    "these conditions may be together expressed as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the healing length , which is of order one in the present notation .",

    "( [ quint ] ) reduces to the nlse with nonlocal cubic nonlinearity , whose solutions were studied too , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the degree of non - locality is quantified by the ratio between the soliton s width and spatial extent of nonlocal response function @xmath11 . depending on this ratio , qualitatively different behaviors can be observed .",
    "namely , in the case of strong nonlocality , i.e. , when the characteristic nonlocal response length is greater than the soliton s width , a sinusoidally  breathing \" mode ( the so - called  accessible soliton \" ) was predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite . in the opposite situation ,",
    "when the width of the response function is small compared to the soliton s size , the governing equation may be approximated by a modified nlse @xcite .    as the kernel in eq .",

    "in this work , our aim was to study the existence , stability and basic dynamical properties of bright one - dimensional solitons based on the balance between the local ( hard - core ) repulsion and long - range dd ( dipole - dipole ) attraction between atoms in the model of the tg gas .",
    "it was found that , depending on the number of atoms and strength of the dd interaction , the solitons assume flat - top or compacton - like shapes . for solitons of the former type , solution of the local cubic - quintic nlse with competing nonlinearities is found to be a good approximation .",
    "numerical simulations of the underlying nonlocal equation with a variable strength of the dd interaction have revealed various dynamical regimes , including the formation of dark solitons on top of a bright one ( of the flat - top type ) , particle - like collisions between them , splitting of the flat - top solitons , and self - similar ballistic expansion of the gas after dropping the dd attraction .",
    "collisions between bright solitons of the compacton type have been investigated in different regimes .",
    "the strong dipolar attraction between the solitons explains that , in many cases , the colliding solitons merge into a breather .",
