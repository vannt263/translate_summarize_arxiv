    "two - dimensional surfaces emerge as interfaces between two different materials .",
    "biological membranes are considered as such two - dimensional interfaces separating some biological materials .",
    "the model of helfrich , kleinert , and polyakov ( hpk ) @xcite describes the mechanics of such surfaces on the basis of the two - dimensional differential geometry and the statistical mechanics @xcite .    one interesting topic is the crumpling transition , which has long been investigated theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "the surface fluctuations grow anomalously at certain finite bending rigidity in the surface models , where a surface collapsing phenomena can also be seen at the same transition point .",
    "these two phenomena have been understood as the crumpling transition .",
    "the surface fluctuation of the model is characterized by fluctuations of the bending energy @xmath1 and , consequently , we can see an anomalous peak in the corresponding specific heat @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the collapsing phenomena are characterized by a discontinuous change of the mean square size @xmath3 and , then , we can see a discontinuous ( or a continuous ) change in the roughness exponent or in the hausdorff dimension .",
    "we have not yet seen that any surface models undergo only one of the two transitions .",
    "experimentally , it was reported that a surface fluctuation transition is accompanied by a collapsing transition in certain artificial membranes @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to consider that these phenomena are two different ones .",
    "buckling of a thin elastic shell is one of the collapsing phenomena @xcite , and it is not always accompanied by the surface fluctuations . in biological membranes ,",
    "the surface fluctuation called a rippling transition @xcite is not always accompanied by the surface collapsing phenomena .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the collapsing transition occurs in a fixed connectivity surface model at finite bending rigidity @xmath4 , where no surface fluctuation transition is observed .",
    "the surface model is defined by the standard hpk hamiltonian , which is discretized on triangulated spherical surfaces with many holes .",
    "the starting surface configuration for the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations is constructed such that the ratio of the area of the holes to that of the surface including the holes is fixed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the transition point @xmath4(@xmath5 ) is relatively larger than that ( @xmath6 ) in the same model on spherical surfaces without the holes . as a consequence ,",
    "the surfaces with holes are relatively smooth at the collapsing transition point @xmath4 .",
    "then , we have @xmath0 even in the collapsed phase .    the result in this paper",
    "indicate a possible collapsing transition which is not accompanied by the surface fluctuation transition in biological or artificial membranes , although the self - avoiding property @xcite is not assumed in the model .",
    "a crumpling phenomenon can also be seen on thin elastic sheets and has been investigated by singularity analysis @xcite .",
    "however , the collapsing transition in biological membranes is not yet completely understood because of the complexity of biological membranes .",
    "in order to construct the lattice that has holes , we start with the icosahedron .",
    "firstly , we divide the edges of the icosahedron into @xmath7 pieces of the uniform length @xmath8 .",
    "then , we have a triangulated surface of size @xmath9 , which is the total number of vertices in the triangulated sphere without holes . then an edge length of the icosahedron corresponds to @xmath7 edges in the triangulated sphere .",
    "secondly , the @xmath7 edges are divided into @xmath10 groups ( @xmath11 ) , where each group has length @xmath12 in the unit of @xmath8 if @xmath10 divides @xmath7 . as a consequence",
    ", we have a sublattice of edge length @xmath13 in the triangulated sphere of size @xmath14 .",
    "we should note that this sublattice makes compartments on the lattice .",
    "finally , one part of the compartments in the sublattice is labeled as holes , and the other remaining part is labeled as the lattice points .",
    "thus , we have a triangulated lattice with many holes .",
    "the total number of holes in one face of the icosahedron is given by @xmath15 and , hence the total number of holes is @xmath16 on the lattice .",
    "because of the holes on the surface , the total number of vertices @xmath17 of the lattice with holes are reduced from @xmath14 , which is the total number of the original triangulated lattice as stated above .",
    "we note that @xmath17 includes the vertices on the boundary of holes .",
    "the size of lattice can be characterized by @xmath18 .     and ( b ) @xmath19 .",
    "the shaded triangles excluding their corners correspond to the holes .",
    "the total number of holes in the face is ( a ) @xmath20 and ( b ) @xmath21 , which are given by @xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   and ( b ) @xmath19 .",
    "the shaded triangles excluding their corners correspond to the holes .",

    "note that the faces are those of the triangulated surfaces , whose total number of vertices is given by the above described number @xmath9 .",
    "the small triangles including the shaded ones in the figures form the above - mentioned sublattice or compartments and , therefore , they are triangulated with more fine triangles . at the corners of each shaded triangle , the three fine triangles , which are not shown in the figures ,",
    "are excluded from the hole ( or equivalently included in the surface ) .     and ( b ) @xmath23 . the total number of holes is @xmath24 in ( a ) , and it is @xmath25 in ( b).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   and ( b ) @xmath23 .",

    "we note that the ratio @xmath28 of the area of holes to that of the surface including the holes is @xmath29 in the limit of @xmath30 or equivalently @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , the total number of triangles in a hole is @xmath32 and , then , the total number of triangles in the holes is @xmath33 , which is easily understood since the total number of faces in the icosahedron is @xmath34 , and the total number of holes in a face is @xmath35 as stated above . on the other hand ,",
    "the total number of triangles on the triangulated sphere is @xmath36 .",
    "then , we have @xmath37 . by using @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    ", we have @xmath40 in the limit of @xmath31 .",
