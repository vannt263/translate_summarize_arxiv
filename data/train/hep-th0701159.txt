    "there have been many attempts to study the effect of extra dimensions .",
    "initial proposals for large extra dimensions @xcite and warped extra dimensions @xcite assume that all particles in the standard model are confined on a brane with four - dimensional world volume . for extra dimensions with the size smaller than the tev scale , it is an interesting possibility that some fields are propagating in higher - dimensional bulk spacetime . in such various brane - world scenarios ,",
    "it is possible for extra dimensions to have an effect far below unification scale or the planck scale .",
    "one of the remarkable extra - dimensional effects in brane - world scenario with bulk fields is in running of coupling constants .",
    "higher - dimensional theory is non - renormalizable .",
    "however , it can be assumed that the contributions from the kaluza - klein ( kk ) states with masses larger than the scale of interest are decoupled from the theory , giving rise to an approximately renormalizable theory . in this approximation",
    "the corrections to the gauge couplings can be calculated . in case of flat extra dimensions",
    ", it has been shown that the appearance of extra dimensions accelerates the running of the gauge couplings , due to the power - law corrections @xcite .",
    "this has been studied in various models such as grand unification @xcite .",
    "possible solutions to the problem raised on non - calculable corrections from unknown ultraviolet physics have also been proposed in some scenarios @xcite .",
    "more recently , the running of gauge couplings has been studied in the universal extra dimension scenario where the extra dimension is accessed by all the standard model fields @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the size of the extra dimension is constrained in order that the gauge couplings remain perturbative up to the scale where they tend to unify .",
    "this reveals the size of extra dimension to be regarded as a significant ingredient for running of gauge couplings in brane - world scenario .    in this paper , we will examine how coupling constants in su(n ) gauge theory behave at high energy scales , depending on the sizes of extra dimensions , where we will take into account not only bulk fields but also brane fields .",
    "our approach is based on four - dimensional kk effective lagrangian similar to @xcite .",
    "the first kk excitation occurs at the scale @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the size of the extra dimension . up to this scale",
    "the gauge coupling evolution has a contribution only from zero mode . between @xmath0 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the running is still logarithmic but beta functions are modified due to the first kk excitation .",
    "whenever a kk threshold is crossed , beta functions are renewed .",
    "in such a way as to track the number of kk states , we will solve gauge couplings as functions of the energy using the background field method .",
    "while the problem of ultraviolet sensitivity is beyond the scope of this paper , our formulation will include possible localized kinetic terms .",
    "we will also examine dependence of gauge couplings on the size of extra dimension in randall - sundrum spacetime .",
    "one - loop beta function of gauge couplings can be calculated in a five - dimensional regularization scheme with holographic guide @xcite .",

    "as suggested in certain models @xcite , the size of extra dimension can be stabilized in the unit of @xmath4 . from this point of view , we will interpret @xmath4-dependent gauge couplings to be @xmath1-dependent and find an asymptotic solution for a gauge coupling in a form dependent on the size of extra dimension .",
