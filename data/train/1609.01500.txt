    "the wns are monopoles of berry curvature and are characterized by integer topological charges . because the net topological charges in the entire brillouin zone ( bz ) must be zero , the wns must appear in pairs with opposite topological charges @xcite . like the electronic weyl semimetal",
    ", the mws has topologically protected chiral surface states between each pair of wns on the sample surfaces @xcite .",
    "the equal energy contour of these surface states form arcs ( called fermi arc ) , and the number of fermi arcs between two paired wns equals to the number of topological charges carried by one of them . moreover",
    ", additional wns and topologically protected surface states can appear in lower energy magnon bands when anisotropic exchange interaction , possibly induced by either doping or strain along the [ 111 ] direction , is introduced .",
