    "<S> @xmath75 is increased and the nematic fluctuations increase in strength . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in this rpa treatment , @xmath77 has a strong dependence on the coulomb interaction @xmath78 between the cu and the o. while the strength of the nematic fluctuations primarily depend upon @xmath3 and @xmath75 , their contribution to the pairing vertex @xmath79 depends on @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath78 provides a coupling of the @xmath71 and the @xmath72 charge fluctuations to @xmath80 which as seen in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gammac ] ) contributes to @xmath81 through four @xmath0 orbital weight factors . in the absence of the @xmath78 coupling , </S>",
    "<S> a coupling of the nematic oxygen charge fluctuations to the @xmath0-wave pairing channel involves the product of four @xmath3 orbital weight factors , which , as seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b , is significantly smaller than the product of four @xmath0-orbital weight factors . </S>",
    "<S> here it is important to remember that the rpa is a weak coupling theory and in strong coupling a large @xmath82 splits the band at the fermi energy into a lower and an upper hubbard band . </S>",
    "<S> hole - doping then moves the chemical potential into the band that has predominantly @xmath3-character and in this case , @xmath78 will play a less important role in the coupling to the nematic fluctuations .     </S>",

    "<S> 4a and b. the deviation of @xmath87 from the @xmath89 form shown as the dashed curves implies the presence of additional higher order @xmath0-wave harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> as one knows , the pairing interaction associated with short range anti - ferromagnetic spin fluctuations primarily involves near neighbor cu sites and leads to the familiar @xmath90 dependence of @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as seen in the plot of @xmath66 , fig .  2a , the nematic fluctuations involve small momentum transfers leading to a longer range interaction and increasing the weight of higher harmonics in @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes particularly apparent in the structure of @xmath87 as @xmath3 approaches @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> as noted , ybco has cu - o - cu bond aligned incommensurate @xmath91 or @xmath92 nematic fluctuations . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , there will be eight regions associated with the fermi surface points connected by @xmath93 where @xmath94 will exhibit additional structure . </S>",
    "<S> again , this structure will narrow and peak as p approaches @xmath10 .    using an rpa approximation for a 3-band model of cuo@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that nematic charge fluctuations can contribute to the d - wave pairing interaction and that the strength of this pairing increases as the doping @xmath3 approaches the nematic qcp . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing interaction mediated by the nematic fluctuations is `` attractive '' for frequencies below a characteristic fluctuation scale and involves small momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> thus it predominantly scatters pairs between ( @xmath1,@xmath95 ) and ( @xmath96,@xmath97 ) states on the fermi surface where the gap has the same sign . </S>",
    "<S> because of the large on - site cu coulomb interaction , the pairing occurs in the @xmath0-wave channel . the small momentum scattering associated with the nematic pairing interaction leads to higher @xmath0-wave harmonics in the @xmath1 dependence of the gap , reflecting the longer range nature of the nematic pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the nematic fluctuations can work in tandem with the `` repulsive '' large momentum transfer spin fluctuation interaction so that both the charge and spin channels contribute to the @xmath0-wave pairing strength . in the present weak coupling theory with the bare interaction parameters that we have chosen </S>",
    "<S> , an sdw phase transition would onset at a higher temperature precluding the nematic instability . here </S>",
    "<S> we have ignored this and used normal state green s functions in calculating the nematic susceptibility and the charge vertex . </S>",
    "<S> a more complete theory would have different interaction parameters in the spin and charge channels and would require an approach capable of treating strong coupling effects . </S>"
