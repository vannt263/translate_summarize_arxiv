    "lithium ( li ) is a key element in the study of the chemical evolution of the universe because it likely has been produced in various sites and events  big bang nucleosynthesis , interactions between energetic cosmic rays and interstellar matter , evolved low - mass stars , novae , and supernova explosions .",
    "the observed li evolutionary curve has a plateau for young galactic ages ( @xmath4 2.5 gyr ) followed by a steep rise .",
    "this indicates that a relatively low - mass stellar component with long lifetimes is a major source of li in the recent universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "some low - mass evolved stars have indeed been found to have li - enriched surfaces ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there has been no observational confirmation that such stars supply li to interstellar medium .",
    "li contained in stellar surface could easily be depleted by convection , because li should be destroyed inside stars where temperature is higher than 2.5 million k.    novae , which evolve from low - mass binaries , are expected to be one of the candidates for li suppliers in the recent universe , because they experience explosive nucleosynthesis and mass - loss simultaneously .",
    "@xcite made the first theoretical study of li production in novae .",
    "they predicted that the radioactive isotope of beryllium , @xmath0be , produced via the reaction @xmath1he(@xmath2 , @xmath3)@xmath0be  during the tnr in the accumulated thin gas layer on the surface of a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the produced @xmath0be  will be blown away from the surface of a wd by the outburst wind , then decays to form @xmath0li  in the cooler interstellar environment within a short time ( a half - life of 53.22 days ) . in the 1990s , details of this process , which is called as the cameron - fowler process , were studied by theoretical analyses ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , we have reported the detection of @xmath0be  in the post - outburst uv spectra of the classical nova v339 del ( @xcite ) . because the resonance doublet lines of beii are located at @xmath53130    where the telluric absorption mainly caused by ozone severely obstructs observations from ground - based telescopes , quantitative studies of the stellar be abundances",
    "have been enabled in 1990s by the advent of 8 - 10 m class telescopes on high mountains .",
    "they are equipped with high - resolution spectrographs having high sensitivities in the near - uv region [ e.g. , @xcite ( kecki telescope ) ; @xcite ( vlt ) ] .",
    "extensive analyses of stellar be abundances were conducted for large samples of metal - poor stars ( @xcite ) and solar analogs ( @xcite ) . in the case of v339 del , we found that the absorption lines of beii were purely originating from @xmath0be  instead of the stable @xmath6be .",
    "therefore , it was the first observational confirmation of the cameron - fowler process in classical novae .",
    "the @xmath0be  was found in highly blue - shifted ( radial velocities , @xmath7@xmath5 1000 kms@xmath8 ) absorption lines , which are assumed to correspond to nova ejecta blown off from the surface of a wd by the outburst wind . through the direct comparison of absorption strengths between @xmath0beii  and caii , we estimated that the @xmath0be  abundance in the ejecta of v339 del could be higher than the pre - existing theoretical prediction ( @xcite ) . @xcite reported the presence of the lii@xmath96708 line in the blue - shifted absorption line system in the early phase ( 713 days after the outburst ) spectra of v1369 cen ( nova centauri 2013 ) .",
    "the overabundance of li in this nova amounts to the order of @xmath10 with respect to the solar photospheric composition .",
    "now it is quite interesting to know how commonly this @xmath0be  ( = @xmath0li ) production occurs among various types of classical novae and evaluate their contribution to the li evolution in the galaxy .",
    "prompted by these interests , we have performed high resolution spectroscopic observations of two galactic novae discovered in march 2015  v5668 sgr and v2944 oph , during their early decline phases .",

    "although the @xmath0beii  doublet can not be resolved , its total equivalent widths , @xmath46s , in the lvc and the hvc are measured . after subtracting the combined effects of contaminations discussed above , we tabulate the resulting @xmath46 in table[table - ew ] .",

    ", we need the following assumptions ; ( 1 ) both the @xmath0beii  and caii  lines are not saturated , ( 2 ) the covering factor of the absorbing gas cloud to the background illuminating source has no wavelength dependence .",
    "we notice that the lvc feature of @xmath0beii  at @xmath51 kms@xmath8  of v5668 sgr might be saturated .",
    "the bottom of the @xmath0beii  lines in the lvc almost reaches to that in the hvc , where its flat profile suggests that the absorption is saturated .",
    "the corresponding lvc component of the caiik line in v5668 sgr is shallow and the line appears to be unsaturated .",
    "the abundance of @xmath0be  in v5668 sgr obtained under such a condition should be taken as a lower limit .",

    "are comparable to or even higher than those of ca .",

    "they noted that the @xmath1he  destruction via @xmath1he(@xmath1he , 2@xmath75)@xmath71he  is less pronounced in co novae than in one novae .",
    "because both v5668 sgr and v2944 oph are found to be co novae ( see the next section ) , we guess that the process of @xmath1he  destruction should be ineffective and that most of @xmath1he  in the accreted gases have been converted into @xmath0be  in both novae .",
    "the detection of @xmath0be  in the post - outburst spectra of v5668 sgr and v2944 oph strongly suggests that the explosive production of @xmath0be  is a popular phenomenon among classical novae .",
    "the light curves of both novae show slower evolution than that of v339 del in which the rapid decline were observed in @xmath5 + 40 d. adopting the relation between the time - scaling factor of the light curve and the wd mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the wd masses of both novae are lower than that of v339 del .",

    "<S> we report spectroscopic observations of the resonance lines of singly ionized @xmath0be  in the blue - shifted absorption line systems found in the post - outburst spectra of two classical novae  v5668 sgr ( nova sagittarii 2015 no.2 ) and v2944 oph ( nova ophiuchi 2015 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the unstable isotope , @xmath0be , should has been created during the thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) of these novae and decays to form @xmath0li  within a short period ( a half - life of 53.22 days ) . </S>",
    "<S> confirmations of @xmath0be  are the second and the third ones following the first case found in v339 del by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the blue - shifted absorption line systems in both novae are clearly divided into two velocity components , both of which contain @xmath0be . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the absorbing gases in both velocity components consist of products of tnr . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate amounts of @xmath0be  produced during outbursts of both novae and conclude that significant @xmath0li  should have been created . </S>",
    "<S> these findings strongly suggest that the explosive production of @xmath0li   via the reaction @xmath1he(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath0be  and subsequent decay to @xmath0li  occurs frequently among classical novae and contributes to the process of the galactic li enrichment . </S>"
