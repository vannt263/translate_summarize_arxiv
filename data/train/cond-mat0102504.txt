    "in the present paper , we study the spin polarization and the magneto - luminescence of a neutral , medium - size quantum dot ( qdot ) subjected to a strong ( pulsed ) laser pumping and a strong magnetic field .",
    "there are many good reasons to study the properties of this system .    on one hand , recent magneto - tunneling experiments @xcite have stated very clearly the role of zeeman energies , lateral confinement and coulomb repulsion in the spin polarization of a qdot filled with @xmath0 electrons .",
    "at `` filling factors '' @xmath1 , ground - state rearrangements lead to significant oscillations of the conductance peak positions as a function of the magnetic field",
    ". the situation could be even more interesting for electron - hole ( e - h ) clusters , where additional e - h correlations come into play .",
    "traces of spin rearrangements shall be seen in the luminescence and other optical properties .    on the other hand ,",
    "extensive measurements of quantum well ( qwell ) luminescence exist for different e - h densities ( laser excitation power ) and polarizations @xcite .",
    "a bcs - based theory has been proposed @xcite .",
    "very high magnetic fields , up to 60 t , have been applied mainly to low - density systems , and the results have been interpreted in terms of isolated neutral and negatively charged excitons @xcite .",
    "analogous experiments in qdots are lacking , but the available experimental resources are enough to create a high population of excitons in a medium - size qdot in a strong magnetic field .",
    "6-exciton luminescence has been undoubtedly observed in single small inas quantum dots at @xmath2 @xcite . in qwells , very high e - h densities ( @xmath3 pairs/@xmath4 )",
    "have been achieved with pulsed pumping @xcite .",
    "our model quantum dot is made up from a symmetrical gaas - algaas quantum well , 8.5 nm wide in the growth direction .",
    "stress is supposed to induce a lateral confinement , which is described by a parabolic potential with @xmath5 mev .",
    "an electron - hole system is created in the dot by a strong 5 ps pulsed laser , as it is experimentally done for example in ref .. the mean lifetime of this system is around hundred of ps or even longer , i. e. a time scale much greater than the characteristic times ( @xmath6 1 ps ) to reach equilibrium @xcite .",
    "thus , at very low temperatures we end up with an `` stable '' @xmath0-pair e - h cluster in its ground state .",
    "results for spin - up and -down densities , hole and electron spin polarizations and for the position and magnitude of the coherent luminescence peak as functions of the magnetic field and of the mean number of excitons are presented below .",
    "the theoretical framework used is a bcs - like wave function , corrected against particle number non - conservation by means of a lipkin - nogami procedure @xcite .",
    "this wave function is able to reproduce the expected `` bose condensed '' state in the @xmath7 limit @xcite .",
    "a big basis of one - particle states is used , which includes up to 3 landau levels and 202 states per landau level .",
    "we consider systems with up to 40 e - h pairs .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , the model to be employed is described in details .",
    "the basics of our theoretical scheme are summarized in section iii . in section iv ,",
    "the main results are presented and discussed .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 electrons and @xmath0 holes confined in a quasi two - dimensional quantum dot , and in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field . as mentioned above , the qdot is made up from a 85  - wide symmetric qwell .",
    "a parabolic potential confines the motion of the particles in the plane perpendicular to the grow direction .",
    "the first qwell sub - band approximation is used , i. e. the confining energies along the @xmath8 direction are written as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . notice that for the @xmath11  - width gaas well , the gap to the second qwell state is @xmath12 mev , and @xmath13 mev for electrons and holes respectively , whereas the typical coulomb energy is @xmath14}$ ] mev .",
    "this model is a common theoretical framework in the study of strained or self - assembled quantum dots @xcite . by using the symmetric gauge , @xmath15 , dimensionless coordinates , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , and using landau level ( ll ) states",
    "@xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the radial , angular momentum and spin quantum numbers , respectively ) as set of one - particle states , we can write the hamiltonian in second quantization as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 are the electron and hole effective masses , @xmath23 is the dot confining frequency , and @xmath24 is the dielectric constant .",
    "@xmath25 is the gap separation between the conduction and valence bands , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the effective g - factors , @xmath28 is the bohr magneton , @xmath29 are the @xmath8-components of the ith particle spin , @xmath30 are the ll energies for electrons ( holes ) , @xmath31 is the electron ( hole ) cyclotron frequency , and @xmath32 are the electron ( hole ) destruction and creation operators .",

    ", @xmath43 changes sign at @xmath44 t. consequences of this facts are discussed below .",
    "the bcs approach has been successfully applied by paquet _ et .",
    "_ in the study of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) e - h system @xcite , and by fernndez - rossier and tejedor to the exciton gas in a qwell@xcite .",
    "we used it previously in the study of finite e - h systems at zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we employ the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) scheme to avoid particle number non - conservation in a finite system .",
    "the bcs wave function is given by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 are the respective electron ( hole ) vacuum .",
    "the subscript `` @xmath0 '' in the bcs function means that the average number of pairs is just @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath47 . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the variational parameters .",
    "they fulfill the normalization conditions @xmath50 .",
    "the hole state @xmath51 which is paired with the electron state @xmath52 is different for the two magnetic field regimes , reflecting the ground state spin structure , as it is show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for @xmath53 t ,",
    "electrons and holes with opposite spins are paired , then @xmath54 .",
    "whereas for @xmath55 t , the energy is minimized when the @xmath56 electronic state is paired with @xmath57 .    the total angular momentum ( projection onto the z axis ) , corresponding to @xmath58 is zero because the angular momentum of each pair is zero .",
    "the total electron or hole spin , however , depend on the populations of spin - up and down components .",
    "the detailed description of the ln method can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    ", we sketch the main results .",
    "the ln estimate for the ground state energy is given by :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the expectation value of the effective hamiltonian @xmath61 in @xmath58 :    @xmath62    notice that in the second term , the sum runs over hole states @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 are the one - particle energies , and @xmath65 is the expectation value of the harmonic potential .",
    "the mean value of the number of pairs is    @xmath66    the extrema conditions can be written in the standard form of gap equations    @xmath67    where the hartree - fock energies are given by    @xmath68    and we have used the usual bcs parameterization    @xmath69    the chemical potential @xmath70 was introduced to fix the particle number , and @xmath71 is determined in the ln scheme as :    @xmath72    where the expectation values @xmath73 are taken in the @xmath74 state .",
    "the resulting equations are solved iteratively up to a precision of @xmath75 in @xmath76 .",
    "calculations were performed for @xmath77 pairs and @xmath78 one - particle ll states .",
    "as shown below , the spin polarization of the electronic subsystem increases as the magnetic field is increased . at @xmath79 t",
    ", the electronic @xmath80-factor changes sign according to eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] , leading to a rearrangement of electron - hole pairing in the absolute ground state .",
    "the kind of pairing minimizing the energy is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by dashed lines . for @xmath55 t",
    ", the ground state is dark , and it is not even clear whether it can be reached by means of light excitation followed by spin relaxation processes .",
    "thus , besides the ground state , for @xmath55 t , we compute also the lowest bcs state with @xmath81 and @xmath82 excitons .",
    "below , we present results for the @xmath83 system , obtained with three lls and 202 states per level , i. e. a total of 606 one - particle states .    as mentioned above , two bcs functions may be constructed .",
    "one in which optical excitons are formed , and a second one in which dark excitons are formed .",
    "the difference @xmath84 is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of @xmath38 , showing that the dark state becomes the ground state when the value @xmath85 t is crossed and the electronic sub - bands are re - ordered .",
    "the absence of efficient spin relaxation mechanisms may , however , prevent the actual ground state to be occupied .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference @xmath84 , in the magnetic field interval shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is very close to the difference between the electronic zeeman energies",
    ". a simple qualitative picture can be offered for the understanding of this and the next figures .",
    "the properties of the system are roughly determined by the holes because of the competition among the hole zeeman energies and the total harmonic and coulomb energies .",
    "the hole occupations are thus very similar for optical and dark states .",
    "the form of e - h pairing provides the `` fine structure '' .",
    "that is , the minimization of the energy leads to a definite pairing",
    ".    scaled spin - up and -down densities , obtained from    @xmath86 ^ 2,\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . at @xmath87 t",
    ", we show the ground ( dark ) and optically - active excited - state densities , which are almost inverted in agreement with the argument given above .",
    "notice that there are only four excess spin - up electrons at @xmath88 t. these small net polarizations for high magnetic fields are related to the attractive character of the e - h interaction . unlike pure electron systems ,",
    "small - radius orbits maximize e - h attraction , and the competition between zeeman and coulomb energies starts at higher fields .",
    "the `` hole dominance picture '' leads to changes in the polarization , as @xmath38 is increased , through the reconstruction of the droplet edge , in a way very similar to electrons near filling factor one @xcite .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the difference between ground - state spin - up and -down densities for different values of @xmath38 are shown .",
    "it is evident that polarized densities differ mainly at the edge , and that changes in the polarization are more significant at the edge .",
    "the following two figures , figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , contain the main results of our paper .",
    "electron and hole spin polarizations are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "solid lines refer to the ground state , while the dashed lines for @xmath55 t refer to the optically active state .",
    "notice that even at a high field value like 45 t , the electronic polarization is only 70 % .",
    "notice also the change in sign of the ground - state electronic spin at @xmath89 .",
    "the inset shows the total ground - state spin squared , computed from    @xmath90    the total ( coherent ) magnetoluminescence intensity for both @xmath81 and @xmath82 polarizations is presented in fig .",
    "we compute it for @xmath82 polarization , for example , from the expression    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is a basis of @xmath93 particle states , @xmath94 is a composed index and , @xmath95 is the interband dipole transition operator for the @xmath82 circularly polarized light . notice that @xmath96 is the integrated luminescence , corresponding to the transition from the given initial bcs state to any final state .",
    "the convention for solid and dashed lines is the same as in fig .",
    "it shall be stressed that the degree of polarization , defined from    @xmath97    follows very well the behaviour of @xmath98 , i. e. the difference between the occupation of spin - up and -down sub - bands .",
    "this polarization is nearly 10 % at 20 t , and around 70 % at 45 t.    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show results for the position of the luminescence line and the intensities as functions of the numbers of pairs in the dot . in our computations , the energy is corrected against non - conservation of the total number of excitons , @xmath0 .",
    "conservation of the number of @xmath81 and @xmath82 excitons is not properly taken into account .",
    "thus , we can not exactly compute the position of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 lines . in place of it , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a the difference @xmath99 relative to the exciton @xmath82 line , @xmath100 .",
    "the following interesting properties can be noticed in this figure : a ) a blueshift as the number of excitons is raised @xcite .",
    "it is around 0.2 mev / exciton at @xmath101 , and 0.15 mev / exciton at @xmath102 , and b ) an apparent minimum of each curve at @xmath38 around 30 t , i. e. at @xmath103 . on the other hand",
    ", the intensity ( fig . [ fig6]b ) shows an increase with @xmath0 for both polarizations , as one would expect from coherent emission .",
    "we have computed the spin polarization and the luminescence of a quantum dot in which a mean number of electron - hole pairs , @xmath0 , have been created by a laser pulse .",
    "band mixing effects were approximately taken into account by means of well width- and magnetic field - dependent masses and @xmath80-factors .",
    "for the model under study , the electron @xmath80-factor vanishes at @xmath44 t. it means that , for magnetic field values around @xmath103 , the electron polarization , and thus the ratio of intensities given by formula ( [ eq16 ] ) , is determined as a result of the interplay among coulomb , confinement and hole zeeman energies .",
    "the net polarization is only 70 % at @xmath104 t because of the attractive electron - hole interaction .",
    "the general features found in our calculations , i. e. relatively small polarizations even at high magnetic field values , blueshift of the luminescence lines with an increase of the laser power , etc seem to be not related to the specific parametrization used for carrier masses and @xmath80-factors .",
    "the developed computational scheme may be applied to many other interesting situations , from which two of them may be distinguished .",
    "the first is the stationary regime , in which constant populations of @xmath82 and @xmath81 excitons arise as a result of appropriate pumping , recombination and spin - flip processes @xcite .",
    "the second is the study of the effects of hyperfine interactions between nuclear and electronic spins on the position of the recombination lines , known as overhauser shifts @xcite .",
