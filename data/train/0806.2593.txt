    "black holes provide one of the most active areas of gravitational research , and a prime testing ground for quantum gravity .",
    "many aspects can already be analyzed under the assumption of spherical symmetry , which is sufficient to describe non - rotating black holes . in vacuum , for instance , a reduced quantization is possible @xcite .",
    "this reduction has thus often been used in diverse approaches to quantum gravity , and also loop quantum gravity @xcite has provided its own formulation @xcite .",
    "this allows one to use the loop representation constructed in the full theory in a simpler setting in which , as one hopes , one can find and analyze physical solutions .",
    "the result is a set of many coupled partial difference equations for a wave function on midisuperspace , which reflects the discreteness of spatial geometry realized in a loop quantization . as a consequence , spacelike classical singularities as they occur e.g.  in the best - known case of the schwarzschild solution are removed because their high curvature regimes no longer present boundaries to quantum evolution @xcite .",
    "so far , these present the only inhomogeneous singularities analyzed by the methods of loop quantum gravity , and the situation appears much more non - trivial than in homogeneous models . due to this complexity , several questions remain open . in particular , inhomogeneous models allow not only spacelike singularities but also null or timelike ones , which may even be naked ; see e.g.@xcite and references therein . their fate presents additional problems of high interest which can be studied in spherical symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , even the spherically symmetric equations in loop quantum gravity are difficult to tackle , and so it becomes interesting to look at further reductions which can preserve the physical setting but provide mathematical simplifications .",
    "some of the possible effects have been introduced in a more ad - hoc manner in the models of @xcite , and were used mainly to understand implications on the horizon dynamics .",
    "a drawback of such an approach is that quantum corrections are not clearly linked to key ingredients of a loop quantization , or any quantization one could apply to the full , unrestricted theory .",
    "we thus intend to introduce new models which , starting from the spherically symmetric reduction along the general lines of @xcite , provide further simplifications .",
    "moreover , we will pay special attention to the anomaly problem which is required for full consistency .",
    "the possibility followed here is a reformulation of the spherically symmetric constrained system as it is used in the canonical definition of lemaitre  tolman  bondi ( ltb ) models @xcite . in this classical reduction ,",
    "one solves the diffeomorphism constraint and , inserting the solutions into the hamiltonian constraint , simplifies the set of equations .",
    "this eliminates some of the equations and removes several gauge issues .",
    "the remaining equations are then easier to quantize and solve .",
    "the imposed conditions make the constrained system partially second class , and thus are not straightforward to implement at the quantum level . symmetry reduction , which is also partially second class and can be done at the kinematical quantum level @xcite , provides some guidelines , but the gauge fixing conditions required for ltb models are more complicated . while these issues are discussed here",
    ", we postpone a direct implementation at the dynamical quantum level and rather perform in this article an analysis of the quantum correction terms one can expect for the classical equations .",
    "nevertheless , we will be able to highlight several important issues at the quantum level , such as the role of dynamical lattice refinements of discrete states @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will see that not all refinement schemes discussed so far in anisotropic homogeneous models can be embedded in spherically symmetric ones .",
    "but a large class still remains because only the direction dependence , not the size dependence of refinements is determined .",
    "what we provide in the main part of this paper is an analysis of consistent sets of quantum corrected equations of motion for a type of non - perturbative inhomogeneities , which has not yet been available in other models studied in the framework of loop quantum gravity .",
    "previous equations either refer to homogeneous models @xcite , where strict effective equations can be derived as analyzed in a canonical setting in @xcite , but the consistency issue trivializes , or to perturbative inhomogeneities as in @xcite . in our case , inhomogeneities can be non - perturbative but their equations are arrived at only after performing a partial gauge fixing",
    ".    we will thus be able to restrict the form of possible quantum corrections by the condition that they provide consistent deformations of the classical equations .",
    "thus , we will discuss how quantum corrections due to loop quantum gravity should occur in order to guarantee consistent ltb - like solutions .",
    "we will not be deriving strict effective equations , but we will determine consistent anomaly - free consequences of different types of quantum corrections . for several of the consistent choices we study consequences for inhomogeneous spherically symmetric systems based on analytical as well as numerical considerations .",
    "our main interest here , as often in this context , is the fate of classical singularities .",
    "compared to other models which by now have been studied extensively in loop quantum cosmology @xcite , a new feature is the possibility of non - spacelike singularities in ltb systems . interestingly , none of the corrections studied here resolve such singularities directly ( nor spacelike ones in these models ) , in contrast to what their analogs do so easily in homogeneous models .",
    "however , numerically we find indications that shell - crossing singularities generically occur in the presence of the corrections , where only shell - focusing singularities would do in classical theory .",
    "the shell - crossing singularities are expected to be weakly extendable , or to be avoidable by realistic matter .",
    "this is one example for new effects in inhomogeneous models , which not surprisingly prove themselves much more non - trivial than homogeneous ones .",
    "the line element in a general spherically symmetric spacetime with polar coordinates @xmath0 can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are functions of the time and radial coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 . alternatively",
    ", the form suitable for a canonical analysis , as done below , is @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are again free functions of the radial coordinate @xmath6 and time @xmath5 only . in a canonical quantization , the lapse function @xmath8 and the shift vector @xmath9 appear as lagrange multipliers of the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints , respectively .",
    "they are thus not dynamical , unlike the remaining functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 which have non - trivial momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 , together forming the kinematical phase space of spherically symmetric gravity . in ( [ dsss ] ) ,",
    "the shift vector has already been chosen to vanish , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are related to @xmath8 and @xmath10 in obvious ways .",
    "we start with a spherically symmetric matter source whose stress - energy tensor @xmath16 is diagonalized in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the energy density , the radial pressure and the tangential pressure , respectively .",
    "einstein s equation and the conservation law then reduce to a set of partial differential equations given by @xmath21 where we have introduced @xmath22 called the misner  sharp mass .",
    "the misner  sharp mass @xmath23 is generally defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 takes values 0 and 1 corresponding to the 2-manifold coordinatized by @xmath5 and @xmath6 . at spherical",
    "trapping horizons @xcite we have @xmath26 .",
    "( to see this , one can use the simple criterion for the spherically symmetric trapping horizon as the place where constant area radius surfaces become null @xcite .",
    "this is the boundary of the region of spherical trapped surfaces ; there may be non - spherical trapped surfaces outside that region @xcite . ) in an asymptotically flat spacetime , the asymptotic value of the misner ",
    "sharp mass at spatial infinity equals the adm mass @xmath27 .",
    "we can define a conserved current from the misner ",
    "sharp mass , which is called the kodama current and given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the antisymmetric tensor satisfying @xmath30 . by definition , the current @xmath31 satisfies the conservation law @xmath32 .",
    "the kodama current provides the energy density @xmath33 in agreement with ( [ eq : m ] ) .      in classical einstein gravity",
    ", there is an exact solution which describes a spherically symmetric collapse system sourced by inhomogeneous dust : the lemaitre - tolman - bondi solution @xcite . for dust",
    ", we have @xmath34 such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdot ] ) implies that @xmath35 is an arbitrary function of the radial coordinate only . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) , we then have @xmath36 for the dust density .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) implies that @xmath37 can be made to vanish by rescaling the time coordinate @xmath5 such that it becomes the dust proper time .",
    "( [ eq : rdot ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath38 where @xmath39 is another arbitrary function .",
    "the resulting line element can be written as @xmath40 where the only dynamical function left satisfies , from eq .",

    "we can integrate the equation of motion to @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an arbitrary function specifying initial values at @xmath47 .",
    "its freedom can be absorbed by defining the function @xmath11 in terms of the coordinate @xmath6 at @xmath47 .",
    "for instance , requiring @xmath48 and choosing the lower sign in ( [ ts ] ) for a collapsing model , we have @xmath49 and thus @xmath50 ( an example is the self - similar solution @xmath51 obtained for @xmath52 as studied in @xcite . ) of special interest in those solutions is the small-@xmath6 behavior of @xmath11 which may be regular or singular . in particular , the energy density ( [ eps ] ) can be divergent where @xmath53 , giving rise to shell - crossing singularities . while solutions are no longer valid beyond this point , shell - crossing singularities are deemed avoidable by more realistic matter models ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "moreover , solutions are extendable through shell - crossing singularities in a distributional sense @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , energy density as well as the ricci scalar can diverge when @xmath54 , giving rise to a shell - focusing or central singularity which is the main interest here .",
    "the properties of shell - focusing singularities in ltb models have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was proven that naked singularities form generically in this system @xcite .",
    "this provides a new arena for effects of quantum gravity , which we will come back to in more detail in sec .",
    "[ s : app ] .",
    "we will be using loop quantum gravity which requires hamiltonian techniques . in the canonical formulation of spherically symmetric einstein gravity , the hamiltonians of the gravitational sector , @xmath55 , and of the matter sector , @xmath56 , for the ltb system provide the expressions @xmath57 after replacing the momentum in terms of @xmath58 . the total hamiltonian constraint @xmath59",
    "then yields eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_conservation ] ) .",
    "below , we will provide a detailed canonical analysis based on ashtekar variables , which will allow us to incorporate some corrections as they are expected from loop quantum gravity .",
    "( see @xcite for a canonical analysis in adm variables , and @xcite for an analysis in arbitrary dimensions . )      for a canonical formulation only the spatial part of the metric provides the dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , the most successful canonical quantization of gravity , loop quantum gravity , is based on a densitized triad @xmath60 rather than a spatial metric @xmath61 , which are related by @xmath62 .",
    "( we use tangent space indices @xmath63 and internal gauge indices @xmath64 . ) the spatial metric for a spherically symmetric system in components of this variable is given by @xmath65 where instead of the spherically symmetric spatial metric components @xmath10 ( which equals @xmath66 ) and @xmath11 ( which equals @xmath67 ) the spherically symmetric triad components @xmath68 and @xmath69 appear .",
    "written as a densitized vector field taking values in su(2 ) with basis @xmath70 , these components define the spherically symmetric densitized triad by @xmath71 such that @xmath72 .",
    "( for more details on this decomposition see @xcite .",
    "notice that the sign of @xmath68 is not restricted to be positive , while @xmath73 is defined to be non - negative .",
    "the sign of @xmath68 thus determines the orientation of the triad since @xmath74 ; it plays an important role for fundamental singularity resolution @xcite , but not for most of the analysis done in this article . ) the remaining freedom of the three functions @xmath68 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 not contained in the components @xmath68 and @xmath73 is pure gauge since it does not affect the metric",
    ". it can be parameterized by an angle @xmath77 which is subject to u(1)-gauge transformations .",
    "the corresponding gauss constraint is @xmath78= \\int{{\\rm d}}x \\lambda(x)((e^x)'+p^{\\eta})$ ] where @xmath79 is the momentum of @xmath80 .",
    "fields canonically conjugate to the original triad components @xmath81 are ashtekar connection components of @xmath82 also here we introduce the u(1)-gauge invariant quantity @xmath83 and the gauge angle @xmath84 .",
    "only the difference @xmath85 of the angles is gauge invariant , while each of them can be changed by the same amount with a gauge transformation .",
    "however , the new parameter @xmath86 is not canonically conjugate to @xmath73 ; see @xcite for details . in terms of the u(1)-gauge invariant triad component @xmath73 , its conjugate variable is rather given by @xmath87 which happens to be proportional to an extrinsic curvature component @xcite .",
    "( the constant of proportionality is given by the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter @xmath88 @xcite . )",
    "the canonical pairs we will be dealing with are thus @xmath89 , @xmath90 for which @xmath91 and another pair @xmath92 for the gauge angle .",
    "the relation between the remaining ashtekar connection component @xmath93 and extrinsic curvature is @xmath94 where the spatial derivative @xmath95 of the angle is the ( negative ) @xmath6-component of the spin connection .",
    "its angular components are given in terms of @xmath96 which determines the relation between @xmath86 and @xmath97 as @xmath98 without reference to @xmath99 .",
    "solving the gauss constraint removes the gauge angle and its momentum , and implies that invariant objects can depend on the @xmath6-component of the ashtekar connection only through the extrinsic curvature quantity @xmath100 .",
    "we are then left with only two canonical pairs @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "a further reduction can be implemented by using the ltb form of the variables corresponding to the metric ( [ ltbmet ] ) . comparing the spatial parts of the metrics ( [ ltbmet ] ) and ( [ ltbe ] ) one obtains the ltb relation @xmath103 in particular , we have @xmath104 everywhere . for a complete reduction of canonical degrees of freedom ,",
    "this is to be accompanied by a condition between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we will determine this by consistency with the constraints , such that ( [ ephi ] ) is preserved in time .",
    "constraints in real ashtekar variables as used here have been derived in @xcite .",

    "thus , @xmath55 is left as the sole constraint to restrict initial values and generate equations of motion for ltb models .",
    "in fact , the conditions ( [ ephi ] ) and ( [ kphi ] ) can be seen to be consistent with the classical equations of motion for @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 generated by ( [ hg ] ) ( in addition to solving the diffeomorphism constraint identically ) .",
    "thus , the reduction to ltb form is dynamically consistent and provides correct space - time solutions .",
    "maintaining this consistency will be our main guideline in the analysis of quantum effects .",
    "like any quantization of an interacting system , quantum gravity implies corrections to classical equations of motion and thus forces us to re - address consistency issues of classical reductions .",
    "as we will see explicitly , for a loop quantization this provides valuable feedback on the consistency or possible anomalies of the overall framework . in ltb systems ,",
    "once a consistent reduction has been found , it can be used for applications to black hole singularity issues .",
    "we focus on loop specific issues which do not arise in wheeler  dewitt type quantizations of @xcite which have for instance been applied to hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "a loop quantization @xcite of spherically symmetric gravity is based on holonomies @xmath123 for the configuration variables instead of linear expressions in connection or extrinsic curvature components . here ,",
    "we have used edges @xmath124 and vertices @xmath125 in the radial line . the use of these variables is strongly motivated by general results of loop quantum gravity @xcite : background independence , i.e.quantization in the absence of a metric other than the physical one determined by @xmath60 , is realized in a well - defined representation of smeared basic variables for holonomies together with fluxes as 2-dimensionally integrated densitized triads . but",
    "operators for connection or extrinsic curvature components themselves do not exist .",
    "an orthonormal basis of gauge invariant states in the connection representation is given by @xcite @xmath126 with integer labels @xmath127 and positive real labels @xmath128 on edges @xmath124 and vertices @xmath125 , respectively , forming a finite graph @xmath129 in the 1-dimensional radial line .",
    "the labels determine the connection dependence by irreducible representations of the groups spanned by the holonomies .",
    "( these groups are u(1 ) for @xmath93-holonomies and the bohr compactification @xmath130 of the real line for @xmath97-holonomies ; see @xcite for details . )",
    "the densitized triad , i.e.  momenta conjugate to the connection components , will be derivative operators which are quantized in the full theory in the form of fluxes @xmath131 as integrals over surfaces @xmath132 with co - normals @xmath133 .",
    "their explicit action in spherical symmetry is @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the planck length squared and @xmath136 denote the neighboring edges to a point @xmath6 , distinguished from each other using a given orientation of the radial line .",
    "( we have @xmath137 if @xmath6 is not a vertex of the graph . )",
    "the @xmath138-operators only exist in smeared form after integrating over arbitrary radial intervals @xmath139 .",
    "all flux operators have discrete spectra : eigenstates as seen in ( [ exspec ] ) and ( [ epspec ] ) are normalizable .",
    "but only @xmath140 has a discrete set of eigenvalues , while @xmath138-eigenvalues fill the real line .",
    "( their eigenstates are elements of the non - separable hilbert space of square integrable functions on the bohr compactification of the real line . )",
    "these basic operators can be used for composite operators as well , providing well - defined but rather complicated constraint operators . instead of dealing directly with these operators",
    ", we will extract some typical effects as phenomenological corrections to the classical equations and analyze their potential implications with more ease .",
    "this has been done in quite some detail in cosmological applications @xcite , and we start the same in this paper for inhomogeneous models in the spherically symmetric context . in this way , we provide the first examples where full inhomogeneities , rather than perturbative ones as in cosmology , are studied in this way .",
    "but we emphasize that we do not derive complete effective equations as per @xcite in this paper , which is rather an exploration of possible effects .",
    "nevertheless , restrictions by consistency already provide interesting lessons .",
    "the general consistency issue is similar to that studied after partial gauge fixings in spherical symmetry in @xcite , where it was analyzed based on the general ideas of @xcite , and in @xcite .",
    "our analysis here provides complementary results in a different setting , where we make sure that potential anomalies arising from different correction terms cancel each other .",
    "moreover , the effective treatment allows us to arrive more directly at properties of physical solutions .      the ltb conditions ( [ ephi ] ) and ( [ kphi ] ) in terms of densitized triad and extrinsic curvature variables are well - suited to an implementation at the level of spin networks .",
    "they refer directly to basic expressions of the quantization ( provided that one just exponentiates the relation ( [ kphi ] ) to result in holonomies ) and can thus easily be formulated as conditions for kinematical states . in this way",
    ", the ltb reduction can be performed at the quantum level .",
    "however , consistency issues of the dynamics are not easy to deal with at the complete quantum level .",
    "we will therefore describe the kinematical constructions here , proceed to a phenomenological effective level in sec .",
    "[ s : corrltb ] and then study its consistency . by the link to the initial loop quantization , this indirect route will nevertheless provide feedback on the full theory .    from the triad relation ( [ ephi ] ) we derive a condition for fluxes simply by integrating over arbitrary radial intervals @xmath139 : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the boundary of @xmath139 at which @xmath68 is evaluated , taking into account orientation to have the correct signs .",
    "this relation can be imposed on triad eigenstates ( [ gaugeinvspinnetwork ] ) , where ( [ exspec ] ) and ( [ epspec ] ) imply @xmath143 for any vertex @xmath125 .",
    "this directly eliminates all vertex labels in favor of the edge labels which remain free , analogously to the function @xmath144 which classically determines an ltb metric completely .    on these reduced states ,",
    "it turns out , the ltb condition for holonomy operators is already implemented . upon integration and exponentiation ,",
    "we have @xmath145 expressed solely in terms of elementary holonomy operators .",
    "this condition is realized in the sense that the left and right hand sides , as multiplication operators , have the same action on solutions to the ltb condition satisfying ( [ ltbquant ] ) .",
    "in fact , the left hand side simply increases the label of the edge between @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( which we assume to be two adjacent vertices ) by one .",
    "thus , it changes both @xmath148 and @xmath149 by @xmath150 depending on their sign .",
    "the two operators on the right hand side , on the other hand , change the vertex label @xmath151 by @xmath152 and @xmath153 by @xmath154 in the right way to respect the condition ( [ ltbquant ] ) if it was realized for the original state .",
    "( if there are vertices @xmath125 between @xmath146 and @xmath147 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 change by the same value such that ( [ ltbquant ] ) remains implemented without changing @xmath128 . )    notice that , unlike conditions for a symmetry reduction , the two ltb conditions for densitized triads and extrinsic curvature have vanishing poisson brackets with each other ( but not with the constraints ) .",
    "thus , the curvature condition can indeed be implemented on the solution space of the triad condition .",
    "it does not add further conditions for states because they are written in a specific polarization .",
    "ltb states are thus simply represented by a chain of integer labels @xmath157 for @xmath158 which represents spatial discreteness ( a 1-dimensional lattice of independent sites ) as well as the discreteness of quantum geometry ( integer @xmath157 as eigenvalues of the area radius squared ) . in a connection representation , they can be written as @xmath159 where the assignment @xmath160 is a generalized ltb connection .",
    "while states can be reduced immediately to implement the ltb conditions , further conditions do result for composite operators because ( [ kphiop ] ) must be used if the action of any operator is to be written on the ltb states where ( [ ltbquant ] ) has eliminated vertex labels .",
    "this provides reductions , e.g.  of constraint operators , such that characteristic quantum gravity effects in loop operators can be carried over to constraints for an ltb model .",
    "the first effect we turn to arises from the required quantization of inverse powers of the densitized triad , such as @xmath68 in ( [ hg ] ) .",
    "there is no direct quantization of such an inverse since @xmath140 in a loop quantization ( [ exspec ] ) has a discrete spectrum containing zero , and thus lacks an inverse operator .",
    "nevertheless , one can use general techniques to arrive at a well - defined operator which reproduces @xmath161 in a classical limit .",
    "this quantization is based on the poisson relation between a holonomy and the volume , which one can identify with an expression for @xmath162 .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath163 for the combination of triad components appearing in the first term of ( [ hg ] ) , where @xmath164 is the classical expression for volume in spherically symmetric setting . in these expressions , we follow general constructions of the full theory @xcite .",
    "when quantized , the connection component is expressed through a holonomy , and the poisson bracket becomes a commutator . in order to stay as close to the full theory as possible",
    ", we use su(2)-holonomies @xmath165 which in their matrix elements provide the basic quantities ( [ hx ] ) .",

    "classically , i.e.  for @xmath179 , we have @xmath180 , and this limit is approached by @xmath99 for large @xmath68 . with the correction , the expression for the inverse power of the triad component @xmath68 is finite , just as in the isotropic case @xcite . the general behavior of the correction function is illustrated in fig .  [ ltbalpha ] below .",
    "similar constructions have been used before in spherical symmetry , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "( while finiteness of inverse triad operators is realized in isotropic and spherically symmetric models , this is not expected to be a general property @xcite . nevertheless , inverse triad operators are well - defined in general situations of loop quantum gravity @xcite . )",
    "one should note that @xmath68 refers to the total area of a whole orbit at radius @xmath6 , which can have macroscopic values . in this case , @xmath99 only slightly differs from one .",
    "however , a fully inhomogeneous quantization would refer to flux values of individual microscopic patches , where @xmath181 is a large sum of microscopic contributions @xmath182 , together giving the whole orbit area .",
    "the single fluxes @xmath182 are much smaller and closer to the planck scale , which makes @xmath99 differ from one more noticeably if these fundamental fluxes are used .",
    "this is an illustration of the fact that symmetric models often artificially suppress corrections from inverse triad operators , as first noted in @xcite .",
    "inverse triad corrections analogous to @xmath99 have thus occasionally been underestimated , especially in isotropic models of macroscopic universes with large matter content .",
    "one can model the enhancements of corrections in fully inhomogeneous states even in symmetric models by using higher su(2)-representations of holonomies in operators , not just the fundamental one as understood in ( [ inverseex ] ) .",
    "then , the expression for @xmath99 changes essentially by replacing @xmath183 in ( [ alpha ] ) by @xmath184 if @xmath185 is the spin of the representation .",
    "( see @xcite for precise formulas in those cases . ) for our qualitative analysis here we can focus on the expression ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "in fact , later applications mainly use the small-@xmath68 behavior near a center or a central singularity where corrections are strong for any @xmath185 .",
    "because classically , for @xmath186 , the function @xmath187 approaches one , the classical limit is correct if this function is inserted as a multiplier of @xmath188 in the hamiltonian constraint",
    ". we can thus write ( [ hg ] ) as @xmath189    the form of corrections is usually not fully unique due to the presence of quantization ambiguities . sometimes , however , they can be restricted more strongly by relating , whenever possible , reduced expressions to what one expects in the full theory .",
    "this provides different options for specific corrections which can be analyzed for robustness and the phenomenology they imply . in the present case",
    ", the full theory may suggest an alternative corrected hamiltonian @xmath190 here , also the second term carries a correction function , which is motivated if one takes into account that the @xmath67 in the second term of ( [ hg ] ) arises from a cancellation in @xmath191 after inserting spherically symmetric variables into the full constraint .",
    "thus , the second term could also be expected to have a correction by @xmath99 .",
    "we will analyze both cases below and describe the differences they imply .",
    "another characteristic , and in fact eponymous , feature of loop quantum gravity is that not components of the connection but rather its holonomies are represented as operators",
    ". since these are non - linear objects , additional corrections by higher order terms of the connection ( or extrinsic curvature ) will be present which again can be evaluated by including them as correction terms in phenomenological equations .",
    "this may appear as higher curvature corrections as they involve higher powers of extrinsic curvature , but we emphasize that this procedure will not give a complete picture since higher derivative terms are missing .",
    "these can be computed at an effective level @xcite , which would require much more work not pursued here .",
    "we can correct for the holonomy effects in the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hg ] ) as follows .",
    "we assume @xmath192 to be fairly constant over a given edge ( or part of an edge for graph - changing operators ) of the graph whose holonomies appear as basic loop variables , so that @xmath193 where @xmath171 is the coordinate length of the edge lying between the vertices @xmath194 and @xmath195 . rather than using a precise loop quantization of ( [ hg ] ) and computing its expectation value in terms of holonomies",
    ", we make the following replacements in the hamiltonian constraint : @xmath196 and @xmath197 . in addition to @xmath171",
    ", @xmath198 is a dimensionless parameter whose role is discussed below . with these corrections ,",
    "the constraint becomes @xmath199    while this may not be the precise result from a complete effective constraint , it captures the main effects of using holonomies as periodic , rather than linear , functions in the curvature components .",
    "moreover , this simplest choice guarantees that also here the classical limit , which involves a continuum limit @xmath200 and @xmath201 , is satisfied .",
    "note , however , that one should not take the full functional form too seriously but rather view the sine functions as a convenient place - holder for a perturbative expansion in higher powers of the @xmath202-components .",
    "since there will be other corrections as mentioned above , they could easily dominate most of the expansion terms .    although the parameters @xmath198 and @xmath203 appear in similar forms , their origins and roles are quite different .",
    "the parameter @xmath204 arises as the coordinate length of a radial edge along which we compute a holonomy .",
    "its size is determined by the embedded graph we act on , as well as the precise form of the hamiltonian constraint operator understood in the construction . while a hamiltonian operator does not depend on the embedding and thus @xmath171 , that dependence would arise in the cause of computing an effective hamiltonian as the expectation value in a state peaked on a classical geometry .",
    "specifying the classical geometry requires one to partially fix the diffeomorphism gauge ; the size of @xmath171 is then a direct measure for the discreteness of the state in this setting .",
    "also @xmath198 measures the discreteness , but it does not refer to the length of any edge . it is associated with curvature components @xmath106 along spherical symmetry orbits , and there is no room for orbital edges in this reduced model . to understand the meaning of @xmath198 , we again have to look at what it should correspond to in a full , unreduced setting as we did in sec .",

    "the length of each edge , and thus @xmath198 , would decrease with an increasing number of lattice plaquettes @xmath205 : @xmath206 . in particular , for finer lattices we have @xmath207 just as @xmath208 , approaching the continuum limit .",
    "the precise form of @xmath198 depends on the exact state which is approximated by a spherically symmetric one .",
    "in particular , the argument shows that @xmath198 , unlike @xmath171 , may be phase - space dependent if geometrical growth is accompanied by a refinement of the lattice such that @xmath209 depends on @xmath68 , e.g.  by a power - law form @xmath210 .",

    "equidistant versions of the difference equation , which would result if holonomies for a connection or extrinsic curvature component depend only on its conjugate triad component , i.e.  @xmath69 for @xmath106-holonomies , are not embeddable in a spherically symmetric model . in this way",
    ", inhomogeneous models can reduce some of the freedom involved in choosing a refinement scheme for a homogeneous model .",
    "nevertheless , at least a 1-parameter freedom of @xmath210 , or even a different functional behavior , is left .",
    "it is only the direction dependence of @xmath205 which is restricted , not the size - dependence . in particular",
    ", it is impossible to restrict the corresponding freedom in isotropic models .",
    "what we can also see is the fact that spherically symmetric refinement schemes which do not depend on any auxiliary scales can give rise to apparently scale dependent equations in a homogeneous reduction : when reduced to isotropy , a non - trivial refinement scheme can always be expressed by a function @xmath212 of the scale factor @xmath213 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath68 , @xmath213 is coordinate dependent since it rescales if spatial coordinates are multiplied by a constant .",
    "the reduction from spherical symmetry thus must automatically introduce a scaling dependent parameter @xmath214 such that @xmath212 depends only on the coordinate independent combination @xmath215 .",
    "this results in a well - defined way of non - trivial refinement schemes with all the freedom as it is realized in spherical symmetry .",
    "moreover , since the scaling dependence arises only in the reduction to homogeneity , it can not be used as a reliable criterion to rule out refinement schemes if it is applied purely in homogeneous situations .",
    "the lattice refinement behavior is to be expected in any model on general grounds @xcite ; while a direct derivation of the behavior of @xmath209 from a full hamiltonian operator is difficult , one can arrive at some properties and analyze their consequences phenomenologically .",

    "although , as mentioned , the classical ltb conditions are preserved by the equations of motion generated by the spherically symmetric hamiltonian constraint , there is no simple off - shell algebra between these functionals which one could represent on the hilbert space generated by spherically symmetric spin network states .",
    "the various versions of quantum corrected hamiltonians we have provided so far are thus not yet ltb reduced , although we have already removed the spin connection terms as they drop out in the classical ltb reduction . moreover , although we did see that the classical ltb conditions can directly be taken over to the kinematical quantum level , such a step is much more complicated when combined with the quantum constraint algebra .",
    "if overall consistency with the constraints is required , the ltb conditions themselves may well require quantum corrections , too . in this section",
    ", we will be exploring the possibility of ltb - like solutions at a phenomenological effective level , allowing for corrections to constraints as well as the classical ltb conditions .    at this stage , we still have two canonical pairs and two smeared constraints ( the diffeomorphism and corrected hamiltonian constraint ) .",
    "the corrected constraints in this form are automatically consistent ( i.e.  first class ) since the absence of the spin connection terms implies the absence of spatial derivatives in @xmath216 ; the hamiltonian constraints thus commute with themselves .",
    "even if we add the non - dynamical dust contribution @xmath217 in terms of the mass function @xmath218 , the system remains consistent .",

    "the requirement of preserved ltb conditions will , as we will see , restrict the form of quantum corrections in different terms of the constraints .      to derive equations of motion for the metric component @xmath11 left as the only degree of freedom in an ltb metric",

    "on the one hand , we have the equation of motion @xmath304 and , on the other hand , differentiating ( [ exdot ] ) with respect to time gives @xmath305 combining these two equations and writing everything in terms of @xmath11 , we have @xmath306    the evolution equation can now be used to eliminate the second time derivative of @xmath68 from @xmath307 , which together with @xmath268 and in combination with the matter part provides the hamiltonian constraint equation @xmath308 we note that in the limit @xmath309 we recover the classical equation which also justifies the choice of plus sign in ( [ sine and cos in terms of ex ] ) .    finally , we could use a hamiltonian where only @xmath105 has been replaced by periodic functions , @xmath310 in this case , however , the corrected ltb conditions will take a more complicated form because correction functions will have to depend on all the phase space variables , as one can check by making an ansatz as before .",
    "we leave this complicated case open for future work and proceed with a general discussion and applications of the consistent versions found .",
    "we have provided several cases of consistent equations of motion for the variables of a metric of ltb form , but with dynamics carrying corrections as they are expected from loop quantum gravity .",
    "while we have discussed inverse triad and one form of holonomy corrections separately , they can be seen to be combined consistently simply in a multiplicative form of the correction functions in the ltb conditions .",
    "for instance , the first version of inverse triad corrections and the holonomy correction we used can be consistently combined in this way to result in a hamiltonian constraint equation @xmath311 where @xmath312= f(r)\\left(1+\\sqrt{1- \\gamma^{2}\\delta^{2}\\dot{r}^{2}}\\right)^{2}$ ] together with the evolution equation @xmath313 with the second version of inverse triad corrections , we have @xmath314 and @xmath315    while general properties of an ltb reduction allowed us to keep the constraints consistent without severe limitations on quantum correction functions , consistency conditions did remain .",
    "the remaining constraints automatically form a first class system provided that the hamiltonian constraint is free of spatial derivatives , which is realized if spin connection terms ( or the 3-dimensional ricci curvature ) drop out as it happens under the classical ltb conditions .",
    "the consistency conditions arose at the level of formulating the ltb conditions , because the classical ones are no longer preserved under evolution corresponding to quantum corrected constraints .",
    "we thus corrected the ltb conditions , too , such that in their new form they were preserved under the quantum corrected equations of motion as they are generated by a hamiltonian whose spin connection contribution vanishes .    with these conditions we are still identically satisfying",
    "the classical diffeomorphism constraint and thus no new anomalies in the constraint algebra can arise .",
    "however , the corrected ltb conditions do not make the classical spin connection @xmath316 equal @xmath317 , which was assumed in the simplified classical hamiltonians such as ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "thus , to be fully consistent we must assume that the expressions containing the spin connection themselves carry quantum corrections and read @xmath318 for the equations in sec .",
    "[ s : corr1 ] , @xmath319 for sec .",
    "[ s : corr2 ] and @xmath320 in sec .",
    "[ s : corrhol ] .",
    "thus , for consistency additional corrections of this form must arise in the terms of the hamiltonian constraint containing the spin connection in such a way that they vanish after imposing the quantum corrected ltb conditions .    that the spin connection terms carry their own corrections",
    "is a reasonable expectation : there are inverse triad components and , in a loop quantization , the spin connection is rather indirectly expressed via @xmath321 and @xmath322 using the euclidean part @xmath323 of the hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "corrections are thus expected from the inverse triad as well as from holonomies .",
    "the specific form is difficult to determine because the full theory does not provide operators for the non - covariant spin connection components , but as demonstrated here it can be derived and justified by the production of a consistent set of equations . in fact , if such corrections occur , our equations provide a fully consistent ltb system . in this way",
    ", consistency determines what further quantum corrections must be entailed by a primary correction such as @xmath99 .",
    "since not all corrections in a hamiltonian can equally easily be computed , independent consistency considerations provide useful relations between different terms . for instance",
    ", the spin connection is more difficult to quantize than @xmath324 , and its corrections can thus more easily be found via consistency .",
    "an important physical implication is that this suggests additional effects because the space - time metric ( [ ltbmet ] ) is no longer just corrected by different solutions for @xmath325 solving the corrected constraint and evolution equations , but also by an additional pre - factor in terms of @xmath99 , @xmath250 or @xmath129 in front of @xmath326 which is no longer exactly @xmath327 .",
    "this would , for instance , affect the appearance of horizons .",
    "our focus in this paper for applications of the above equations is the fate of the classical singularity which appears at @xmath54 .",
    "there are two possibilities for how such a singularity could be avoided in effective equations .",
    "dynamically , @xmath328 may be bounded away from zero for all @xmath6 , in which case the behavior shown would be comparable to a cosmological bounce . this can sometimes occur if isotropic cosmological models exhibiting a bounce are matched to a spherically symmetric outside region in a generalized oppenheimer ",
    "snyder manner @xcite .",
    "the outright spherically symmetric situation studied here is , however , subject to different corrected equations and so one has to provide a new analysis .",
    "the second possibility is that the value @xmath54 is assumed , but that this does not result in a singular space - time just as minkowski space in polar coordinates has @xmath54 at @xmath329 .",
    "if @xmath54 occurs , one thus has to proceed with a more detailed analysis to understand the space - time neighborhood of the region where @xmath54 .",
    "compared to homogeneous equations , this problem is of a new quality .",
    "as we have seen , there is a non - trivial anomaly problem which we were able to resolve in different versions of quantum corrected ltb models .",
    "the presence of consistency conditions , which do not arise in homogeneous models because they are subject to just a single constraint , makes the form of quantum corrections more restricted .",
    "thus , several different terms in the constraints must receive quantum corrections in a way closely related to each other .",
    "still , we have explicitly shown that non - trivial quantum corrections are allowed .",
    "in addition to the anomaly issue , spatial inhomogeneity allows different types of singularities in classical general relativity .",
    "in particular , not just spacelike singularities can occur as in homogeneous models , but also null @xcite or timelike ones @xcite .",
    "this has interesting general ramifications concerning the consistency of quantum gravity in the sense of allowing stable ground states , as discussed in @xcite , and it underlines the interest in inhomogeneous models . in what follows ,",
    "we present an initial analysis based on analytical as well as numerical methods .",
    "if there is a `` bounce '' where the area radius @xmath11 attains a non - zero minimum value , we have @xmath330 which can be substituted in the above equations to check the possibility for this to happen in quantum gravity . from eq .",

    "there does not appear to be a simple conclusion about bounces as they occur , e.g. , in homogeneous models .",
    "we are looking at specific regimes and certain types of quantum corrections which , by themselves , may make a bounce difficult to occur .",
    "moreover , we have restricted the analysis to marginal models , which classically includes spatially flat friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker models as the interior region of oppenheimer  snyder collapse , but not isotropic models with positive spatial curvature .",
    "the latter ( or scalar matter with negative potential @xcite ) would be required for a bounce based on inverse triad corrections @xcite .",
    "there is thus no contradiction with known matching results based on isotropic interiors @xcite , but the fact that a bounce does not follow straightforwardly , compared to the relative ease by which this can be obtained in isotropic models , may also be taken as a warning sign concerning the robustness of homogeneous bounces .",
    "similarly , we have considered holonomy corrections only of a special form which made the analysis more manageable .",
    "holonomy corrections give rise to bounces more generally than inverse triad corrections @xcite .",
    "one could thus expect that a full treatment of holonomy corrections should give rise to general bounces also in ltb models .",
    "however , even though we did not do such an analysis , such a bounce can not be generic for the following reason : simply choosing a fine spatial graph and thus small enough @xmath171 makes the holonomy corrections studied here the relevant ones . since these corrections do not provide an automatic bounce , a bounce can not be generic in this inhomogeneous system . finally , there is a third effect due to quantum variables which provides corrections in effective equations .",
    "also this has not been included here , but it is unlikely to result in a general bounce given that it does not do so in isotropic models ( where it could even prevent a bounce which would otherwise occur based on holonomy corrections @xcite ) . we thus conclude that singularities in ltb systems do not appear to be resolved by bounces .      as the simplest case , we first consider a vacuum solution where , in the absence of dust , @xmath334 must be satisfied .",
    "if @xmath335 holds , @xmath336 , i.e.  a static configuration , is a trivial solution to any of the corrected equations ( [ consham1 ] ) , ( [ consham2 ] ) and ( [ consham3 ] ) .",
    "while this corresponds to the classical minkowski space solution , since @xmath337 can then easily be introduced as a coordinate instead of @xmath6 , there are quantum corrections for small @xmath11 : our corrected ltb metric , using @xmath338 for ( [ consham1 ] ) to be specific , reads @xmath339 which asymptotically presents minkowski space .",
    "as we will discuss in more detail below , the appearance of @xmath266 shows that quantum effects originating in the spatial discreteness of loop quantum gravity spoil some of the exact symmetries such as spatial homogeneity known to exist in classical solutions .",
    "if there is dust , it is of interest to see whether we can have a friedmann solution in this system . for this",
    "we choose @xmath6 such that it coincides with the circumferential radius at @xmath47 , and make an ansatz of the form @xmath340 .",
    "if such a solution exists , as it does in the classical case , the ltb metric reduces to a friedmann  robertson  walker one where @xmath213 is identified with the scale factor . the dust density profile then becomes @xmath341 where @xmath342 is the initial uniform density .",
    "( according to our general choice of @xmath343 , the scale factor is normalized to @xmath344 at @xmath47 in the cosmological context . ) substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ consham1 ] ) , we have @xmath345 the left - hand side depends only on @xmath5 while the right - hand side depends non - trivially on @xmath346 .",
    "hence , the corrected ltb system does not admit a solution of friedmann form .",
    "there is an additional effect which prevents friedmann solutions for the corrected equations , because our ltb form of the metric receives quantum corrections , too , as a consequence of consistency .",
    "the corrected ltb metrics have coefficient @xmath338 in the case of @xmath347 , and @xmath348 in the case of @xmath349 .",
    "this changes the metric in addition to the corrected dynamics of the metric component @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the metrics are no longer homogeneous because of the non - trivial @xmath11-dependence .",
    "if we were interested in spatial volumes of finite regions in constant @xmath5 slices , for an approximate solution of the form @xmath350 they would become @xmath351 and @xmath352 , respectively .",
    "this illustrates an interesting difference between these two cases which both come from inverse triad corrections : for @xmath353 , we have the small-@xmath6 expansion @xmath354 , while for @xmath99 it reads @xmath355 .",
    "thus , in the first case the spatial volumes vanish at @xmath356 as in the classical case , while the second case implies diverging volumes @xmath357 even of finite regions near @xmath356 .",
    "this suggests further implications of the behavior near a classical singularity , which due to the required inhomogeneity do not appear easy to discern .      as a further consequence of corrections ,",
    "we note that the mass function @xmath218 is no longer directly related to the misner  sharp mass .",
    "we need to distinguish the latter from the dust mass which can be defined as @xmath358 the asymptotic value @xmath359 corresponds to the total mass of dust .",
    "the misner ",
    "sharp mass , on the other hand , now takes the form @xmath360 whose expression changes for the corrected ltb conditions because this affects the relation between @xmath361 and @xmath10 . from the corrected mass",
    ", we can then derive an effective density @xmath362 .",
    "for instance , for the condition consistent with @xmath363 we have a misner ",
    "sharp mass @xmath364 which , upon using ( [ consham1 ] ) , leads to an effective density @xmath365    similarly , for the equations following from @xmath366 , we have @xmath367 and thus @xmath368 in particular , in this case the horizon condition @xmath369 reads @xmath370 , which by the hamiltonian constraint equation agrees with @xmath371 .",
    "thus , in terms of @xmath278 the horizon condition @xmath372 is uncorrected in this case , although @xmath11 as a function of time is corrected compared to the classical behavior .",
    "the correction terms to the effective densities may be nonzero even in vacuum regions devoid of dust .",
    "depending on the regime , they can be positive or negative according to the signs of @xmath373 , @xmath374 and their derivatives involved .",
    "the classical equation can rather easily be analyzed using self - similar solutions ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "one can first write the classical constraint equation as @xmath375 and then , for the special case of a linear mass function @xmath52 , find an explicit solution for @xmath376 of self - similar form which depends on @xmath5 only via the function @xmath377 with a constant @xmath378 .",
    "for such a self - similar solution , the structure of the singularity has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "if we use the second version of inverse triad corrections , this equation is simply changed by multiplying the mass function with @xmath379 .",
    "thus , for a linear mass function there is no longer a self - similar solution .",
    "one would have to incorporate the new factor by changing the mass function , if a self - similar solution is to be obtained .",
    "but this is not straightforward since @xmath99 depends not on @xmath6 but on the unknown function @xmath11 which is to be solved for .",
    "for the first version of inverse triad corrections the equation changes more radically . in this case",
    ", we can bring the constraint equation to the form of an integro - differential equation for @xmath11 , @xmath380f'(x ) -   \\frac{1}{r }   \\int { { \\rm d}}r ( \\alpha-1)\\left(\\frac{{{\\rm d}}r}{{{\\rm d}}t}\\right)^2\\,.\\ ] ] if @xmath381 is small , one can solve this iteratively by inserting the equation for @xmath382 in the integral : @xmath383 the difficulty in solving this is that @xmath218 depends on @xmath6 rather than @xmath11 , so we have to know @xmath337 as a solution and invert it before doing the integration . but this equation already shows qualitatively that the quantum correction makes the solution more non - local , which may prevent the existence of self - similar solutions .",
    "moreover , there will be additional time - dependent effects which do not occur classically .",
    "this is so because @xmath328 , which we need to know in order to replace @xmath6 by @xmath11 in the integrand , also depends on @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the integrals are really time dependent , which one can understand as replacing the classical @xmath218 by a new function @xmath384 appearing on the right hand side of @xmath385 .",
    "this refers only to the case where @xmath381 is small , i.e.  we have perturbative corrections to the inverse triad effects .",
    "it would not allow one to analyze the deeper quantum regime where @xmath99 differs significantly from one .",
    "for this regime we would have to use other techniques , such as the expansions of the following subsection .",
    "however , generally speaking , since the characteritic length scale @xmath386 is explicitly introduced into the corrections , we can not expect this kind of self - similar solutions , which are called complete self - similar solutions or self - similar solutions of the first kind . with the characteristic length scale",
    ", we can only expect incomplete self - similar solutions , e.g. kinematic self - similar solutions in this context ; see @xcite .      for @xmath387 , @xmath388 and the classical limit is recovered . however , for @xmath389 , the deviation from classical theory becomes of order unity . here , deep quantum effects might be revealed by a closer analysis .",
    "we point out that such a deep quantum regime is less reliable if only one type of quantum effect is considered .",
    "nevertheless , an analysis of single effects can provide various possibilities and guide further developments .",
    "moreover , the corrections studied here , based on inverse triad and holonomy corrections , can be combined without changing the conclusions .    to have a regular center in an inhomogeneous case we assume that @xmath278 and @xmath11 admit the following expansions at the center .",
    "@xmath390 where the dots denote higher order terms with respect to @xmath6 , and @xmath391 are constants but @xmath392 may be @xmath5-dependent . in this way , the classical expression for energy density gives an expansion of the form @xmath393 from @xmath218 and @xmath328 , where @xmath394 .",
    "classically , the lowest order then gives @xmath395 with solution @xmath396 where @xmath397 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "hence , for the collapsing case , @xmath398 monotonically decreases and becomes zero in a finite proper time  the central singularity develops where @xmath399 .",

    "if @xmath218 has a cubic term @xmath406 as the lowest order , we find @xmath407 .",
    "however , the additional factor of @xmath6 in the dust energy density proportional to @xmath408 then shows that we can allow a quadratic term @xmath409 in the mass function to produce the desired regular expansion for energy density , although the total effective energy density is still diverging at the center because of the `` vacuum '' contributions in ( [ epsi ] ) .    using the various series expansions in , to lowest order in @xmath6 we get @xmath410 which is solved by @xmath411^{1/2}(t_{0}-t)\\ ] ] where the plus sign corresponds to a collapsing dust cloud and where we have chosen the initial condition @xmath412 . from here",

    "note that @xmath417 is not the complete dust density profile at the initial time but a coefficient in the series expansion for the dust density ) and therefore in terms of the initial density the time for singularity formation is @xmath418 .",
    "for the quantum corrected case a similar consideration gives @xmath419 which implies that the central singularity forms at @xmath420 .",
    "for the second version of inverse triad corrections , the equation to be solved is @xmath421 from ( [ consham2 ] ) . for small @xmath11 , ( [ alpha r near x=0 ] ) implies that the lowest order term on the right hand side goes as @xmath422 if we use the same form of the expansion of @xmath218 as classically . in this case , we can show @xmath407 as in the first version .",
    "however , now our density is @xmath423 if the divergent `` vacuum '' contribution is subtracted , which means that @xmath424 should be required to have a leading term cubic in @xmath6 , such that @xmath278 itself can have lower order terms . in this case",
    ", the singularity is not prevented either .",
    "nevertheless , a finite neighborhood may look different from the classical space - time near a central singularity which , however , would require a more detailed analysis .    for our version of holonomy corrections ,",
    "the equation to be solved is ( [ consham3 ] ) . after expanding in powers of @xmath6 and equating the coefficients on the two sides we obtain ( to order @xmath425 ) @xmath426 which is the same as in the classical case and gives @xmath427 implying that the singularity occurs at time @xmath428 ( the same as in the classical case ) . at order @xmath429",
    "we have the equation for @xmath430 which also does not have any quantum corrections .",
    "effects of the @xmath431 factor occur only at order @xmath432 and higher .",
    "thus the small @xmath6 behaviour with this correction is the same as for the classical ltb model .",
    "the combinations of inverse triad and holonomy corrections in ( [ first order eq with combined effects 1 ] ) and ( [ first order eq in time for combined effect 2 ] ) lead to the same conclusions .",
    "we conclude that there is no indication that the corrections implemented here prevent the ltb singularity from forming .",
    "in particular , naked singularities as they appear in these models do not seem resolved automatically by a loop quantization .",
    "whether they are indeed naked singularities in the presence of quantum effects requires further analysis of the effective space - time : the surroundings of the singularity may be sufficiently different from the classical naked case such that the singularity becomes spacelike .",
    "however , we have shown that a situation which gives rise to a naked singularity classically also gives rise to a singularity ( of some form ) under the quantum effects considered here .",
    "an analysis whether naked singularities remain naked may be of interest in the context of cosmic censorship , which we will come back to in the numerical analysis .",
    "a correction not considered here is the effect of @xmath105-holonomies which are computationally more complicated and may be crucial in some regimes .",
    "in fact , taking the general form ( [ gensol ] ) of classical solutions indicates that @xmath433 is subdominant to @xmath434 near @xmath329 .",
    "this may present a chance for holonomy corrections to remove the singularity , after all .",
    "however , the size of holonomy corrections is also state - dependent : a small @xmath171 suppresses @xmath105-corrections even if @xmath105 is large .",
    "thus , as already noted these corrections can not result in generic avoidance of singularities .",
    "( note that also in @xcite only @xmath106-corrections were included , although the conclusion was that the schwarzschild singularity could be resolved in this way . )",
    "this clearly shows the non - trivial behavior of inhomogeneous situations compared to homogeneous ones .      although some analytical results are available , the region of intermediate values for @xmath11 not in the asymptotic regimes @xmath435 or @xmath436 is difficult to analyze .",
    "we thus complement the preceding analysis by numerical studies of inverse triad corrections .",
    "for the first version , we transform the constraint equation with @xmath437 to @xmath438 ( r^{2})'+(f-1)f ' ,   \\label{eq : k'}\\\\ \\dot{r}&=&\\pm\\sqrt{k+\\frac{f}{r}}\\ , .",

    "the constraint is always satisfied within @xmath439 accuracy .",
    "the spatial integration is done using a fourth - order scheme while the time evolution uses a second - order scheme .",
    "the second version is given by a set of equations which is first integrated by @xmath440 .",
    "the numerical implementation of this equation is easy because we no longer need spatial integration .",
    "our numerical scheme is second - order , which is sufficiently accurate and stable for the present purpose .",
    "it should be noted that there is scale invariance in both sets of equations which are invariant under scaling @xmath328 , @xmath218 and @xmath5 as @xmath441 , @xmath442 and @xmath443 , where @xmath444 is a positive constant .",
    "this scale invariance greatly simplifies the analysis . if the functional form of @xmath218 is the same up to a constant factor , the evolution is similar up to the scaling of time .",
    "we thus do not need to investigate the full parameter space . through this scaling , the classical misner - sharp mass @xmath445 scales as @xmath446 , while the corrected mass @xmath23 does not .",
    "for holonomy corrections , the scaling behavior is lost . here , a dedicated analysis of the whole parameter freedom is required to draw reliable conclusions , which we postpone to future work .",
    "the function @xmath218 corresponds to the conserved mass because it is constant for a comoving observer .",
    "then , @xmath447 is regarded as the conserved mass density . note",

    "as we have already seen , we can recover the general mass scale by rescaling @xmath218 and @xmath5 as @xmath442 and @xmath461 .",
    "in other words , the dynamics of the dust cloud follows this scaling relation .",
    "however , it should be noted that as the corrected misner - sharp mass will not scale in such a simple way , the kinematics of null geodesics on the corrected spacetime will not follow this scaling .",
    "this means that the condition for horizon formation may depend on the mass scale , i.e. @xmath444 . due to our choice for the mass parameter @xmath459 , we can see the correction effect on the null expansions very clearly .",

    "our calculation region covers both the classical and effective regimes .",

    "the dust parameters are set to @xmath473 and @xmath474 .",

    "the time step @xmath475 is chosen so that the physical quantities on each grid point will change their values within 1% at each time step .",

    "hence , we can recover the results for general radius and mass parameters from a simulation done with only one set of parameters .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in summary , the numerical results show that the loop quantum effects significantly slow down the collapse of the central region which is as large as @xmath483 , while in the outer region these effects are not important .",
    "( there are however quantitative differences between the different versions of consistent equations . in the second version",
    "the collapse of the central region is more strongly slowed down and the radius of this central `` core '' is larger than in the first version . ) as a result , the density spike develops at around the radius @xmath483 , which results in the formation of a shell - crossing singularity .",
    "another key feature is that the center is always marginally trapped due to the inverse triad correction to the metric .",
    "this suggests that the shell - focusing singularity appearing at the center might be covered by a horizon .",
    "since the collapse of an inhomogeneous dust cloud in classical general relativity generically ends in shell - focusing naked singularities , this means that although the singularity formed in the generic spherical dust collapse in the present formulation of loop quantum gravity is still locally naked , the shell - crossing singularity appears prior to the shell - focusing singularity and hence the curvature strength of locally naked singularities formed in the gravitational collapse is weakened due to the loop quantum effects . in a naive sense , this seems to favor the cosmic censorship hypothesis in effective loop quantum gravity because shell - crossing singularities are generally believed to be extendible in a distributional sense .",
    "moreover , since the shell - crossing singularity will appear near the center , it is likely to be trapped due to the inverse triad correction to the metric .",
    "we have seen that this is the case for some collapse models in the first version",
    ".    however , one should be careful with any definite conclusion because the present work can only provide insights into some of the quantum effects in gravitational collapse and spacetime singularities .",
    "( for instance , as mentioned earlier we have not included holonomy effects in the numerical analysis because that would require a more detailed analysis of the parameter space . )",
    "the slow - down of the collapse indicates that repulsive forces of quantum gravity are indeed at work , similar to those that resolve big bang singularities in homogeneous models .",
    "but in our inhomogeneous context this does not appear sufficient to provide a uniform bound on energy densities .",
    "the more complicated nature of the problem is indicated by the formation of shell - crossing singularities which may be a consequence of the still present spherical symmetry and the dust idealization used for matter .",
    "we have analyzed the existence of ltb - type models in the framework of loop quantum gravity , starting with an implementation of the corresponding class of spatial metrics at the kinematical hilbert space level .",
    "we first discussed the spherically symmetric setting and in particular noted the role of lattice refinements in sec .",
    "[ s : holref ] .",
    "the discussion turned out to be much cleaner than in purely homogeneous settings , especially regarding the scale dependence of quantum equations .",
    "as an immediate consequence , not all refinement models used so far for anisotropic homogeneous models can be embedded in spherically symmetric models . in particular ,",
    "non - trivial refinement schemes which would give rise to equidistant difference equations ( where point holonomies are of the form @xmath484 with only the variable @xmath485 conjugate to a connection component @xmath486 entering ) do not seem realizable in spherical symmetry .",
    "it is thus important to improve the analysis of non - equidistant difference equations , for instance along the lines of @xcite . despite some restrictions on the refinement scheme ,",
    "a whole class of refinements varying with the spatial size remains allowed .",
    "all these schemes have the correct scaling behavior under coordinate changes , even though further reduction to homogeneous models may suggest improper scalings for some of these models .",
    "this shows that it is only the reduction to homogeneity which may suggest improper scalings because scaling - dependent parameters arising in the reduction are overlooked .",
    "the restriction of refinement models based solely on their rescaling behavior in homogeneous models is thus too strict .",
    "we then turned to the ltb conditions and showed that the classical conditions translate easily to the kinematical quantum level , which allows further studies of quantum reduction mechanisms of loop quantum gravity along the lines of @xcite .",
    "however , the constraint algebra makes a discussion difficult at the dynamical level where the consistency issue of the operator algebra of constraints together with ltb conditions would have to be analyzed . at this stage ,",
    "further progress is possible based on an effective treatment of correction terms . while we have not derived complete effective equations which would contain all relevant correction terms at once , the inclusion of individual correction terms of certain types can already be used to see how quantum effects can be realized consistently .    indeed , we have found consistent formulations of the ltb reduction for different types of corrections : the constraint equations ( [ consham1 ] ) , ( [ consham2 ] ) and ( [ consham3 ] ) with the evolution equations ( [ evolution eq ] ) , ( [ eom2 ] ) and ( [ evolution eq for kphi correction ] ) , respectively .",
    "moreover , the effects can be combined in consistent equations summarized in sec .",
    "[ s : consdisc ] .",
    "the consistency of an anomaly - free formulation relates corrections in different terms of the hamiltonian to each other , but also to required corrections of the classical ltb conditions . here",
    ", our general understanding of an ltb - type reduction is that metric coefficients in ( [ canonmetric ] ) are related to each other by a proportionality @xmath487 .",
    "classically , the factor is one , but consistent quantum corrections require a non - trivial dependence on @xmath11 or @xmath58 which would be important in some regimes .",
    "thus , while we have the same type of reduction of degrees of freedom , explicit dynamical implications for the metric may change . in particular , the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 affects , for instance , the position and behavior of horizons in addition to what a change in the dynamical behavior of @xmath11 would imply . also the behavior near classical singularities changes due to correction factors in the metric which may even diverge right at a classical singularity .",
    "a complete space - time analysis of the resulting effective metrics remains to be done .",
    "the change in the form of the metric had unexpected implications : further reductions which are possible classically , such as friedmann  robertson  walker solutions , no longer exist , although on large scales there are approximate such solutions .",
    "this is quite unexpected and suggests that caution is necessary regarding the dynamical realization of homogeneous models .",
    "moreover , in combination with corrections to the classical equations of motion , we have seen new terms in effective densities which can become negative even where mass densities remain positive .",
    "also numerical simulations suggest that repulsive forces of quantum gravity are active on small scales .",
    "all this can affect the horizon behavior as well as singularities if negative energies and corresponding repulsive forces become strong enough .",
    "however , our analysis of central singularities , which may be spacelike or non - spacelike , did not reveal any indication that they would be prevented completely . while spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity is singularity - free at a fundamental level of difference equations @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite for gowdy models ) , the development of intuitive geometrical pictures requires non - singular equations for an effective geometry .",
    "we have not analyzed full effective equations and did not yet consider all possible correction terms ; it may be that some of the corrections which are more complicated to include can avoid singularities more generally .",
    "nevertheless , the difficulties in avoiding inhomogeneous singularities , in contrast to the fact that several spacelike singularities have been shown to be prevented based on homogeneous models of loop quantum gravity , suggest that general singularities present a qualitatively different issue compared to what has been realized so far . from our numerical simulations we might speculate a possible resolution mechanism more subtle than the analog of a cosmological bounce : strong curvature singularities seem to be replaced by weak singularities which may be extendable by distributional solutions or with more realistic matter models .",

    "<S> the conditions imposed in addition to spherical symmetry turn out to take a simple form at the kinematical level of loop quantum gravity , which allows a discussion of their implications at the quantum level . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the spherically symmetric setting of inhomogeneity illustrates several non - trivial properties of lattice refinements of discrete quantum gravity . nevertheless , the situation at the dynamical level is quite non - trivial and thus provides insights to the anomaly problem . at an effective level , </S>",
    "<S> consistent versions of the dynamics are presented which implement the conditions together with the dynamical constraints of gravity in an anomaly - free manner . </S>",
    "<S> these are then used for analytical as well as numerical investigations of the fate of classical singularities , including non - spacelike ones , as they generically develop in these models . </S>",
    "<S> none of the corrections used here resolve those singularities by regular effective geometries . however , there are numerical indications that the collapse ends in a tamer shell - crossing singularity prior to the formation of central singularities for mass functions giving a regular conserved mass density . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find quantum gravitational obstructions to the existence of exactly homogeneous solutions within this class of models . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that homogeneous models must be seen in a wider context of inhomogeneous solutions and their reduction in order to provide reliable dynamical conclusions .    </S>",
