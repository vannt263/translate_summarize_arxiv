    ", we will consider the effects of pauli s exclusion principle on high - density hydrogen plasmas .",
    "the previous studies of dense hydrogen included several hypothetical assumptions about the character of the high - density phase @xcite .",
    "while metallization of solid hydrogen near @xmath3 k has not been clearly verified so far for pressures of up to 300 gpa @xcite , metal - like features have been observed in shock - compression @xcite .",
    "metal - like conductivities have been observed around 140 gpa and 3000 k @xcite .",
    "recent experiments were able to reach that region as well and to provide detailed information on the equation of state ( eos ) and the conductivity in the mbar - region @xcite .",
    "the transition to metal - like behavior changes drastically our present understanding of the behavior of hydrogen at ultra - high pressures . in the present paper",
    ", we will show that the most important effect leading to the destruction of bound states is pauli blocking .",
    "due to the pauli exclusion principle , the free electrons in the plasma can not penetrate into the interior of atoms and molecules . at high densities",
    "this leads to an enormous pressure acting on the neutrals which will finally be ionized .",
    "the effective energy levels of hydrogen , which strongly depend on density and weakly on temperature , are introduced into the thermodynamic functions . in order to calculate the ionization / dissociation equilibrium we minimize the free energy with respect to the composition .",
    "recently , we derived an expression for the free energy of dense hydrogen @xmath4 @xcite in the framework of the chemical picture and calculated the degree of ionization @xmath5 and the degree of dissociation @xmath6 as well as the isothermal eos , the hugoniots and the isentropes .",
    "pauli blocking was taken into account by the concept of excluded volume , which is based on the idea of space occupation by atoms and molecules .",
    "we will show that a more fundamental approach based on an effective schrdinger equation @xcite , leads to important modifications of the earlier results .",
    "we focus on the interaction between atoms and free electrons and present a microscopic treatment based on the underlying pauli exclusion principle . in the following we will use rydberg units with @xmath7 , so that the binding energies of the isolated hydrogen atom are simply @xmath8 . embedding the hydrogen atom in a plasma environment , the interactions with the medium are treated by an effective wave equation @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the fourier transform of the coulomb potential . the center of mass motion has been neglected , assuming the adiabatic limit @xmath11 . in general , the plasma hamiltonian @xmath12 will depend also on @xmath13 and on the energy , if dynamical and retardation effects are taken into account . the plasma hamiltonian will shift the energy eigenvalues @xmath14 and will modify the wave functions @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , due to the plasma interaction the binding energies may merge with the continuum so that the bound states disappear , if the influence of the plasma increases with increasing density .",
    "this dissolution of bound states is called mott effect and has important consequences for the macroscopic properties of the plasma .",

    "similarly , the fock term as the second term in eq .",
    "( [ pauli ] ) can be evaluated as @xmath28 it compensates partially the pauli shift .",
    "since the temperature dependence of the fock shift is similar to that of the pauli shift we may use in first approximation the same temperature function as in ( [ paulit ] ) and the total shift is approximated by @xmath29 the shift is shown in fig .",

    "( [ mf1 ] ) the continuum part of the spectrum describing scattering states , only the fock shift contributes to the energy shift .",
    "the lowest energy in the continuum occurs at @xmath22 and is shifted by @xmath30 .",
    "however , the two - particle continuum state can only be created at the fermi momentum since all states below that are occupied .",
    "thus the continuum of scattering states begins at @xmath31 where we have in the zero temperature limit the fock shift @xmath32 shown also by the dashed line in fig .",

    "the mott condition @xmath35 with @xmath36 expresses the idea that atoms are destroyed if the mean distance of the electrons is equal or smaller than the bohr radius .",
    "there exist many alternative estimates of the binding energy shift .",
    "for example , the confined atom model @xcite assumes that the atom is embedded into a sphere with radius @xmath37 . in first approximation",
    "this theory gives the shift ( in rydberg units ) @xmath38 .",
    "correspondingly , the binding energy would disappear at @xmath39 , i.e. , already at a much smaller density ( see also fig . [ effener0 ] ) .",
    "better estimates based on numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation give a value of about @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "our estimate is in the same region .",
    "according to our estimate , the effective binding energy would disappear at @xmath40 .",
    "this seems to be too early ; the reason is that perturbation approximations tend to overestimate effects .",
    "better results may be obtained by variational approximations to the solution of the effective schrdinger equation .",
    "to apply the ritz variational approach , we have to symmetrize the hamiltonian in the effective wave equation introducing the function @xmath41^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "we will consider the zero temperature case and use the _ ansatz _ corresponding to a variable bohr radius , @xmath42 here @xmath5 is a parameter which characterizes the occupation in the momentum space . in a more refined approach",
    "we may take into account that no states below the fermi momentum are available .",
    "the shift of the binding energy as function of the density is shown in fig .",
    "[ effener0 ] . within a better approximation",
    "we take the fermi function in the zero temperature limit , @xmath43 , and evaluate the pauli blocking shift integrating over the wave function @xmath44 .",
    "we obtain @xmath45 \\psi_0 ^ 2 ( p ) \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{4 \\alpha^2}{\\pi}\\left[\\frac { ( p_f^2/\\alpha^2 -1)p_f/\\alpha }   { ( 1+p_f^2/\\alpha^2 ) ^2}+ \\arctan ( p_f/\\alpha ) \\right ] .",

    "it can be seen that the temperature dependence of the pauli blocking term becomes weak . even within the variational approach ,",
    "the densities where the energy levels disappear and consequently full ionization occurs , are evidently still too low to explain the observed effects .",
    "we include now the fock term which is of the same order as the pauli blocking term .",
    "even if the fock term is not of primary importance for the disappearance of the bound state energy , it has to be included in the total shift of bound and scattering states to be consistent ( so - called conserving approximations ) . in the zero temperature limit",
    "we get after some transformations the integral @xmath46 which reproduces in the low - density limit the value @xmath47 given above in eq .",
    "( [ fockb ] ) .",
    "we may estimate the temperature dependence as above in perturbation theory .",
    "for convenience of the numerical procedure in the later variational calculations of the free energy we constructed an interpolation formula between the boltzmann and the zero temperature limits , i.e. eqs .",
