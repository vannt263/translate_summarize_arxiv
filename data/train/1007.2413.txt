    "in recent years it has become clear that the insulating side in the vicinity of the mott metal - insulator transition may , in some frustrated lattices , provide a realization of the long sought quantum spin liquid state . these are insulators with an odd number of electrons per unit cell and that do not order magnetically or break lattice symmetries which would double the unit cell .",
    "examples are the layered quasi - two dimensional organic materials@xcite @xmath0 and @xmath1_2 $ ] , and the three dimensional ` hyperkagome ' material@xcite @xmath2 .",
    "these materials can all be driven metallic by application of moderate pressure@xcite , and hence are appropriately thought of as _ weak _ mott insulators which are not too deep into the mott side of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "indeed quantum spin liquid behavior may well be a common fate of weak mott insulators .",
    "in contrast , the quantum spin liquid state remains much more elusive in strong mott insulators with geometric frustration .",
    "a notable exception is the spin-@xmath3 kagome magnet@xcite @xmath4 .    a fundamental question about the mott transition is the fate of the fermi surface of the metal as it transitions into the mott insulator .",
    "theoretically the natural spin liquid state in the vicinity of the mott transition retains a ` ghost fermi surface ' of mobile neutral spin carrying fermionic excitations ( dubbed spinons ) even as the charge of the electron gets pinned to the lattice to form an insulator .",
    "such a state has been proposed to describe the _ intermediate _ temperature physics of many of the candidate spin liquid materials@xcite .",
    "experimentally both organic salts and @xmath2 have gapless spin excitations with a low temperature specific heat@xcite and spin susceptibility@xcite resembling that of a metal even though they are insulating for electrical transport .",
    "further recent experiments@xcite in @xmath1_2 $ ] show metallic thermal transport in this insulator , suggesting that the gapless excitations are , in fact , mobile .",
    "how can we really tell if such a ghost fermi surface of spinons survives in a weak mott insulator ?",
    "if the spinon fermi surface state survives to low-@xmath5 , motrunich@xcite has discussed the possibility of unusual quantum oscillation phenomena in a magnetic field to detect the fermi surface .",
    "however in practice it is likely that the spinon fermi surface undergoes an instability at low-@xmath5 , possibly related to spinon pairing@xcite .",
    "consequently other less direct methods to detect it at intermediate @xmath5 are called for .",
    "another idea@xcite is to look for an oscillatory coupling between two ferromagnets separated by a spin liquid material due to rkky spin correlations associated with the spinon fermi surface .",
    "however unlike the standard giant magnetoresistance effect the oscillatory coupling can not be readily detected by measuring the electrical resistance , and some further idea is required .",
    "this scheme also requires controlling the thickness of the spin liquid layer to atomic precision , and hence is challenging .",
    "in this paper we identify new and surprising aspects of such a spin liquid mott insulator that may potentially offer a simpler route to detecting the spinon fermi surface .",
    "first we show that the electrical charge density in response to an external potential has friedel oscillations at the  @xmath6 \" wavevectors that connect tangential antipodal portions of the spinon fermi surface .",
    "friedel oscillations in the charge density are a well known property of metallic systems with a sharp electron fermi surface .",
    "remarkably these oscillations survive the transition into the spin liquid mott insulating state .",
    "the spinons that form the fermi surface in this spin liquid carry spin , and hence there are @xmath6 singularities in the spin response",
    ". however spinons are electrically neutral - despite that the @xmath6 singularities also show up in the charge response .",
    "fundamentally the charge friedel oscillations stem from @xmath6 singularities in the _ spinon number density _ response .",
    "this is a spin singlet response and should be distinguished from the _ spin density _ response which is a spin triplet . in a weak mott insulator ,",
    "short wavelength fluctuations of the spinon density will couple to the electrical charge density and lead to the charge friedel oscillations .",
    "a closely related effect is the existence of a kohn anomaly at the @xmath6 wavevectors in the phonon spectrum arising from the coupling of the phonons to the spinon density .",
    "another related effect will appear in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) spectra above the threshold bias for tunneling into the mott insulator .",
    "near the threshold the tunneling spectrum will show spatial modulation near impurities with wavelength set by the @xmath6 wavevectors of the spinon fermi surface .",
    "these related effects are more directly measurable in experiments and can serve to detect the spinon fermi surface .",
    "we provide an estimate of the magnitude of the oscillation amplitude of the charge density and show that it is essentially unchanged as the material undergoes the metal - insulator transition .",
    "however it is rather weak compared to the free fermi gas so that its direct measurement may be even more challenging that in a normal metal .",
    "not surprisingly , the oscillation magnitude decreases with increasing mott gap , eventually going to zero in the extreme limit of a spin model with no charge degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast the kohn anomaly is not similarly weakened and survives even into the strong mott insulator limit .",
    "just as in a normal metal , it is therefore likely easier to detect the friedel oscillations through their effects on the phonon and stm spectra .",
    "for concreteness consider a one band hubbard model at half - filling on a non - bipartite lattice such as the triangular lattice : @xmath7 where @xmath8 destroys an electron with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the electron number at site @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath12 is an on - site repulsion .",
    "as the ratio @xmath13 decreases the system undergoes a mott transition from a fermi liquid metal to a mott insulator .",
    "we are interested in situations in which this mott insulator is a non - magnetic spin liquid with gapless spin excitations .",
    "the mott transition and the spin liquid phase are conveniently discussed using the slave rotor representation of ref . .",
    "we write @xmath14 with @xmath15 a spin-@xmath16 charge-@xmath17 boson , and @xmath18 a spin-@xmath3 charge-@xmath16 fermionic spinon .",
    "the electrical charge at a site @xmath19 is identified with the boson number and is conjugate to the boson phase @xmath20 .",
    "the physical electron operator is manifestly invariant under local opposite phase rotations of @xmath21 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "a proper reformulation of the hubbard model in terms of the @xmath21 and @xmath18 will thus include an emergent @xmath22 gauge field .",
    "an effective theory@xcite for the phases of the hubbard model is given by an imaginary time path integral with action@xmath23here @xmath24 are the temporal and spatial components of the emergent @xmath22 gauge field .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 are boson and spinon hopping amplitudes which may be estimated in a mean field approximation .",
    "@xmath26 is adjusted to ensure that @xmath27 .    in a mean field approximation , which ignores the gauge but not other interactions ,",
    "the charge sector is mapped to a boson hubbard model with hopping @xmath28 and boson repulsion @xmath29 while the spin sector is described by free fermionic spinons that form a fermi surface .",
    "when @xmath30 is large , the boson hopping @xmath28 dominates leading to a state with @xmath31 . in terms of the original electrons",
    "this is a fermi liquid phase .",
    "as @xmath30 is decreased , the bosons form a mott insulating state with a charge gap .",
    "this corresponds to a spin liquid electronic mott insulating state which retains a fermi surface of gapless neutral spin-@xmath3 spinons . beyond mean field , at low energies in the mott insulating phase the bosons may be integrated out , resulting in an effective theory of a spinon fermi surface coupled to a @xmath22 gauge field .",
    "the possibility of sharp @xmath6 singularities for spinons was addressed in an early work@xcite .",
    "very recently controlled calculations@xcite of @xmath6 singularities in both the spinon number @xmath32 and the spin @xmath33 have been performed .",
    "consider for instance the static density response function @xmath34 of the spinons at a wavevector @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath36 is any @xmath6 wavevector that connects two antipodal tangential portions of the spinon fermi surface then @xmath37 is singular for small @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the magnitudes of the components of @xmath41 that are parallel and perpendicular to @xmath36 respectively . the exponent @xmath42 and the scaling function @xmath43 depend on spatial dimensionality .",
    "for instance in two dimensions and in the absence of the gauge field the exponent @xmath44 .",
    "the presence of the gauge field modifies the exponent in a manner that is described in ref . .",
    "in three dimensions the gauge field plays a more innocuous role and the exponent is the same as in the usual three dimensional fermi liquid .",
    "thus the spinon density correlations have sharp singular structure at all such @xmath6 wavevectors of the underlying spinon fermi surface .",
    "exactly the same exponent @xmath42 and scaling function @xmath43 also describe the @xmath6 singularities in the spin density correlations due to an emergent symmetry of the spinon fermi surface state@xcite .",
    "we now show that in a _ weak _",
    "mott insulator the universal short distance @xmath6 oscillation in @xmath45 imprints itself on the correlations of the physical electrical charge @xmath19 as well .",
    "further the magnitude of the oscillations are more or less unchanged across the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the spinon number @xmath45 is a spin singlet operator that transforms under lattice and time reversal symmetries in the same way as the electrical charge @xmath46 .",
    "thus on general symmetry grounds we might expect that there is a linear coupling between @xmath47 and @xmath48 so that any structure in the @xmath47 correlator is transferred to @xmath48 . for _ long wavelength _ external perturbations that couples to the charge density ( which is the boson density ) , the boson system is gapped and the charge response is that of an incompressible insulator .",
    "however for _ short wavelength _ perturbations the boson density will have a non - zero response which , in turn , induces a response of the spinon density . if the wavevector matches a @xmath6 wavevector of the spinon fermi surface , there will be long range friedel oscillations of the fermion density that couple back to the physical charge density which will therefore show friedel oscillations .",
    "an approximate self - consistent calculation of the magnitude of this effect may be done within the slave particle mean field theory .",
    "an external potential with fourier components @xmath49 induces some change @xmath50 in the chemical potential . in general the hopping parameters",
    "@xmath51 will also change , for a rough estimate we ignore these below .",
    "the resulting change in the boson and fermion densities may be expressed in linear response theory as @xmath52 here @xmath53 are the density response function of the boson and fermion respectively .",
    "the condition @xmath54 determines @xmath50 .",
    "the charge density response function defined through @xmath55 then takes the form @xmath56 this is the well - known ioffe - larkin composition rule which we now use to evaluate the @xmath6 response . near a @xmath6 wavevector @xmath57 ,",
    "the spinon density response @xmath58 has the singularity discussed above .",
    "however as we move across the metal - insulator transition , though the small @xmath59 response of the boson change strikingly the high @xmath59 response will be only weakly modified .",
    "we write the fermion density response @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the smooth background response at @xmath6 and @xmath62 is the singular part . denoting @xmath63 , we get for the singular part of the electrical density response @xmath64 where the reduction factor @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 @xmath65 is the amount by which the friedel oscillations of the electrical charge density are reduced compared to the oscillations of the spinons . as @xmath67 is varied across the mott transition both @xmath68 and @xmath69 will be essentially unchanged so that the factor @xmath65 , and hence the magnitude of the charge friedel oscillations , is more or less the same on either side of the transition .",
    "@xmath65 may be estimated within the slave rotor mean field theory coupled with a large-@xmath70 approximation to the quantum rotor model that describes the bosons ( see appendix [ app : rotor ] ) . near the mott transition",
    ", we find @xmath71 .",
    "though the magnitude of the charge friedel oscillations is thus very small it is interesting conceptually that it is there at all . in the next section",
    "we will see how we may directly probe in experiments the @xmath6 singularities of the spinon density response .",
    "going deeper into the mott insulator decreases @xmath65 .",
    "the extreme limit of a spin model corresponds to @xmath72 for all @xmath59 and @xmath73 as expected .    actually as discussed above the detailed nature of the @xmath6 singularity for the spinons",
    "is modified and even potentially enhanced@xcite in the mott insulator as compared to the fermi liquid due to the coupling to a gapless @xmath22 gauge field .",
    "thus we reach the remarkable conclusion that not only are there charge friedel oscillations in the insulator but they may even be more slowly decaying than in the metal .",
    "the presence of the @xmath6 singularities in the charge density response relies fundamentally on the @xmath6 singularities in the spinon density response .",
    "we now argue that this latter singularity directly affects the phonon and stm spectra which could be more directly useful to detect the spinon fermi surface .    in a metal",
    "the singular @xmath6 density fluctuations imprint themselves on the phonon spectrum through the famous kohn anomaly . here",
    "we show that a similar kohn anomaly occurs in the spin liquid mott insulator . in the spin liquid , the charge of the electron gets pinned to the ions that make up the underlying lattice , while the spin continues to be mobile and forms a fermi surface .",
    "thus the oscillating entity in a phonon mode is the electrically neutral ion - boson composite ( see figs . [",
    "fig : fl],[fig : sl ] ) .",
    "however this neutral object carries gauge charge of the boson @xmath21 , and hence there will be long range interactions between different ion - boson composites . consequently to properly describe the phonon spectrum we must take into account the screening of the emergent gauge interaction by the spinon fluid .",
    "specifically there will be an emergent ` coulomb ' interaction between the ion - boson composites that will be screened by the mobile spinons .",
    "as in the usual discussions of the kohn anomaly the ability of the spinon fluid to screen the gauge interaction is sharply changed as the phonon wavevector passes through any @xmath6 wavevector . consequently there is a kohn anomaly .",
    "this argument also makes clear that the kohn anomaly will survive even deep into the mott insulator so long as the system retains the spinon fermi surface .",
    "thus it is not weakened by the suppression of electric charge fluctuations , and will be more or less unchanged from a weakly interacting metal .        in metals friedel - like oscillations",
    "have been imaged through scanning tunneling microscopy .",
    "the most common strategy is to measure the spatial modulation of the tunneling spectrum at fixed bias .",
    "this modulation comes from the standing wave pattern caused by interference between plane wave states that are mixed by defects . strictly speaking these are distinct from the friedel oscillatons but at low bias the modulation is again at the @xmath6 wavevectors of the fermi surface . in the mott insulator",
    "we are faced with the immediate problem that ( at @xmath74 ) there is a gap in the single electron spectrum .",
    "however if the bias exceeds the gap it will be possible to tunnel into the sample .",
    "we show below that the tunneling spectrum at a bias voltage close to the gap will acquire spatial modulation at the @xmath6 wavevectors of the spinon fermi surface .",
    "the tunneling spectrum near the threshold is readily calculated within the slave rotor mean field theory .",
    "the local tunneling density of states @xmath75 is then a convolution of the boson and fermion densities of states @xmath76 : @xmath77 in appendix [ app : dos ] we show that @xmath78 for @xmath79 , and increases linearly just beyond the threshold ,",
    "_ i.e _ @xmath80        .smallest wave - vectors connecting antipodal tangential portions of the fermi surface in the spin - liquid candidates [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the presence of a defect such as a step edge or an impurity , @xmath81 oscillates as a function of spatial location @xmath82 at the @xmath6 wavevectors of the spinon fermi surface for low frequency @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 will also have some @xmath82 dependence but will not oscillate at the same wavevectors . near the threshold",
    "the tunneling electron creates a boson with energy close to @xmath85 and a fermion close to zero energy .",
    "as shown in appendix [ app : dos ] the coefficient @xmath86 will show spatial modulation at the @xmath6 wavevectors .",
    "we now comment on the observability of these effects in the candidate spin materials in hand , namely the quasi - two dimensional @xmath0 and @xmath1_2 $ ] , and the three dimensional @xmath2 .",
    "in all three materials determination of the phonon spectrum ( to look for the kohn anomaly ) through neutron scattering is challenging but may possibly be done through inelastic x - ray scattering techniques . in the organic materials the spinon fermi temperature is estimated to be @xmath87 .",
    "consequently the kohn anomaly will only be visible at much lower temperature .",
    "furthermore due to the layered structure it will be independent of the component of momentum perpendicular to the layers .",
    "some representative wavevectors along high symmetry directions are given in table [ table2kf ] , and the surface of all @xmath6 wavevectors in the first brillouin zone is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2kfsurf ] assuming a perfect triangular lattice .",
    "the hyper - kagome material @xmath2 has a rather complicated band structure in its metallic state which will be inherited by the spinons in the proposed spin liquid mott insulator .",

    "stm studies of the insulating spin liquid will be useful both in determining the single particle gap and in detecting the possible spinon fermi surface . in this context",
    "we note that in @xmath0 the charge gap as measured by optical conductivity and dc transport is small ( in the 15 -100 mev range ) though it is hard to extract a precise number",
    ". this range should be readily accessible in stm experiments .",
    "finally we comment briefly on strong mott insulators with negligible virtual charge fluctuations but which nevertheless are in quantum spin liquid phases .",
    "this is the situation , for instance , in the kagome material @xmath4 .",
    "such systems are well described by simple spin - only models with dominant nearest neighbor exchange .",
    "spin liquids with spinon fermi surfaces may emerge in these spin - only models as well .",

    "what is the interpretation of the @xmath6 singularities in the spinon number @xmath47 in that case ? as this is a spin singlet this singular @xmath6 response signals slow power correlations of incommensurate valence bond solid order .",
    "such correlations have been found in a spin-1/2 system on a triangular strip @xcite .",
    "the arguments presented above show that phonons of the lattice will couple to these incommensurate valence bond fluctuations ( similarly to the familiar one dimensional gapless spin liquids ) , and there will again be a kohn anomaly in the phonon spectrum at the @xmath6 wavevectors . detecting such an anomaly will then be a non - trivial proof of the proposal that a spinon fermi surface exists in this material .",
