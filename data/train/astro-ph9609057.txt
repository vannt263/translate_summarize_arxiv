    "<S> the detection of a heii absorption trough in the spectra of three high - redshift quasars provides new constraints on the spectral shape of the uv extragalactic background . </S>",
    "<S> the relative strengths of the observed flux decrements at the rest - frame wavelengths of 1216 and 304   require a relatively soft radiation field at 4 ryd compared to 1 ryd . </S>",
    "<S> if the ionizing metagalactic flux is dominated by the integrated light from qsos , and the heii reionization of the universe was completed well before @xmath0 , then the uv / soft x - ray spectrum of individual quasars at these epochs must , once the cosmological `` filtering '' through material along the line of sight is taken into account , satisfy similar constraints on the average . </S>",
    "<S> we model the propagation of agn - like ionizing radiation through the intergalactic medium using cuba , a numerical code developed in our prior work . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in order to explain the reported heii absorption , any thermal component responsible for the `` soft x - ray excess '' observed in the spectra of agns at @xmath1 must , at @xmath0 , have a typical temperature @xmath2  ev , and a luminosity not exceeding @xmath3% of that of the `` uv bump '' . </S>"
