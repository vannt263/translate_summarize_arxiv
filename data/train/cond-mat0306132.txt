    "at a normal - superconducting interface , andreev reflection causes a conversion of the quasiparticle charge _ and _ a flipping of its spin  an electron with spin up , incoming towards the superconductor , is reflected as a hole with spin down .",
    "this leads to exciting consequences in the transport physics where the focus is put on creating , manipulating and detecting spin currents and magnetization.@xcite when the carriers are spin polarized , the transport properties are strongly sensitive to the relative orientation of the ordered moments of ferromagnetic electrodes,@xcite a feature that has received a lot of interest due to the relatively long spin dephasing times observed in metals@xcite and semiconductors.@xcite in hybrid systems containing a superconductor , various aspects of the interplay between andreev reflection and ferromagnetism have been addressed theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite    the structure of interest here is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig1](a ) : two ferromagnetic contacts are connected to a normal conductor which is in turn connected to a superconductor . of particular interest",
    "is the case of crossed andreev reflection between ferromagnetic leads with antiparallel polarization dominating over crossed normal reflection .",
    "in such a geometry , with a voltage applied to one of the leads while the other lead and the superconductor are grounded , the injected current from the biased ferromagnetic lead effectively _ drags _ along a current from the grounded lead .",
    "this effect is easy to understand since the transfer of cooper pairs into the superconductor requires a pair of electrons with opposite spin . if the injected current consists only of , say , spin - up carriers , the system supplies the spin - down carriers from the oppositely polarized ferromagnetic lead even though no voltage is applied at this contact .",
    "the physics of the andreev drag effect was already addressed by jedema and van wees _",
    "et al._@xcite for a multi - terminal metallic diffusive conductor .",
    "these authors pointed to negative four - terminal resistances as a consequence of the andreev drag effect .",
    "in contrast , much of the recent theoretical discussion has focused on a geometry where two needle - shaped ferromagnetic leads with antiparallel polarization are directly coupled to a superconductor at two spatially separated points.@xcite in this case , even in the case of @xmath0 spin polarization , the crossed andreev reflection probability is strongly suppressed in realistic geometries,@xcite making the experimental detection of the drag effect difficult .",
    "in addition , the direct connection of the ferromagnetic electrodes to the superconductor might lead to unwanted modifications of the local properties of the ferromagnet@xcite and the superconductor,@xcite suppressing the drag effect .    in this work",
    ", we overcome the above difficulties by inserting a normal multichannel@xcite mesoscopic conductor with generic elastic scattering between the ferromagnetic electrodes and the superconductor [ see the sketch of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "we include arbitrary interface conductances and spin - flip relaxation ( see below ) .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is twofold : ( i ) since the superconductor is only contacted at one point , the drag effect develops to the fullest extent possible , being of the order of the conductances of the contacts between the normal conductor and the ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes ; and ( ii ) the sources of the competing phenomena  superconductivity and ferromagnetism  are spatially separated by the normal conductor .",
    "we find that the andreev drag effect is observable when the conductance of the normal - superconducting ( ns ) interface dominates over the ferromagnetic - normal ( fn ) contact conductances .",
    "the drag effect is reinforced with increasing lead polarization and survives for a considerable amount of spin - flip scattering .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the crossed andreev reflections have a profound influence on the zero - frequency current  current cross - correlations .",
    "we observe that both the thermal noise and the shot noise power measured between the two ferromagnetic leads yield _ positive _ values .",
    "we analyze a hybrid system ( shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) consisting of a normal conductor connected to two ferromagnetic ( f1 and f2 ) and one superconducting ( s ) reservoirs . for simplicity",
    ", the direction of the magnetization of the two ferromagnets is assumed to be collinear and we consider identical fn couplings . any type of contacts , e.g. diffusive- , ballistic- or tunnel contacts , can be treated . in what follows",
    ", we deal with point contacts at the fn ( ns ) interface with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) transversal modes and mode independent transparency @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we consider the case with dimensionless conductances ( in units of @xmath5 ) much larger than unity : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the andreev reflection probability . under these conditions ,",
    "weak localization as well as coulomb blockade effects can be safely neglected .",
    "moreover , the dwell time of the normal conductor , @xmath8 , is assumed to be shorter than typical inelastic scattering times .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we consider the case when the proximity effect inside the normal conductor is suppressed ( but the andreev reflection at the ns interface is taken into account ) .",
    "a strong proximity effect would quench the drag effect as the normal conductor would behave effectively as a superconductor .",
    "@xcite this can be avoided either with a magnetic field ( e.g. , a stray field from the ferromagnets or an externally applied field ) or with a characteristic quasiparticle energy ( bias @xmath9 or temperature @xmath10 ) much larger than the inverse dwell time , @xmath11 . nevertheless , to avoid single particle transport , both @xmath12 and @xmath10 should be smaller than the gap of the superconductor .",
    "the resistance of the system is completely dominated by the resistances of the fn and ns contacts .",
    "moreover , we assume that the physical properties within the conductor are isotropic due to diffusive or chaotic scattering",
    ". we can thus consider the normal conductor to be effectively zero dimensional .",
    "this restricts our model to systems with a spin - flip length much larger than the lateral dimensions of the system , i.e. , there are no spatial variations of accumulated spins inside the dot , though no assumptions are made about the relation between the spin - flip time @xmath13 and @xmath8 .",
    "we stress that all the above constraints form a situation that is experimentally accessible with present techniques .",
    "vertical structures like metallic thin - film heterostructures , epitaxial layers of half - metallic chromium dioxide or diluted magnetic semiconductors are equally suitable for the observation of the effects discussed here .",
    "in fact , a uniform spin accumulation was very recently achieved in a normal metallic island coupled to magnetic leads.@xcite    general theoretical formulations of semiclassical spin transport , based on quasiclassical green s functions , have been developed by brataas , nazarov and bauer for normal - ferromagnetic systems@xcite and by belzig _",
    "et al . _ for normal - ferromagnetic - superconducting systems.@xcite here , we follow the approach of samuelsson and bttiker  @xcite extended to spin - dependent transport .",
    "this simple theory is equivalent to refs .   for the geometry in fig  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "it is directly formulated in terms of distribution functions and allows us to treat the current and the current correlations within a unified framework .",
    "because the proximity effect is suppressed , the electrons and holes are independent  @xcite and the system is mapped onto the equivalent circuit of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) in which the electron and hole subsystems ( with opposite spins ) are connected via andreev reflection .",
    "spin relaxation in the normal conductor gives rise to a spin - flip current between the spin subsystems with the same quasiparticle charge . as a result",
    ", we can describe the conductor with four nodes [ two nodes ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) for each quasiparticle type ( electrons and holes ) ] connected to each other and to the ferromagnetic reservoirs via spin dependent resistances .",
    "we model the spin dependent conductances of the fn contacts as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the spin polarization of the lead @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the density of states of the ferromagnetic lead close to the fermi energy ( @xmath22 ) .",
