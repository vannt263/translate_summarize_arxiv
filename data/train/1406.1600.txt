    "clusters of galaxies , the largest virialized systems in the universe , are filled with the intracluster medium ( icm ) , which consists of x - ray emitting hot plasma with a typical temperature of a few times @xmath18 k. x - ray spectroscopy of the icm enables us to determine its temperature and density .",
    "clusters are often characterized by the virial radius . within this radius the cluster mass can be determined under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ( h.e . ) of the icm , and is a useful parameter for constraining cosmology . in the framework of a hierarchical structure formation based on the cold dark matter paradigm",
    ", clusters are thought to grow into larger systems through mass accretion flows which are merged into the icm at a radius away from a few times the virial radius , along large - scale filamentary structures .",
    "the cluster outskirts around the virial radius would leave a trace of freshly shock - heated accreting matters into the hot icm . in this sense ,",
    "the outermost edge is the real front of the cluster evolution .",
    "however , because of the difficulties in observation , properties , such as temperature , density around the virial radius have not been known well yet .",
    "recent observational studies of clusters with chandra and xmm - newton , with their powerful imaging capability and large effective area , have unveiled radial profiles of temperature , entropy , gas mass , and gravitational mass up to @xmath3 within which the mean cluster mass density is 500 times the cosmic critical density and which is about a half of the virial radius @xcite .",
    "the derived temperature and entropy profiles to @xmath3 are almost consistent with theoretical expectations from the self - similar assumption .",
    "on the other hand , the gas mass fraction @xmath19 increases with radius to @xmath3 , and does not exceed the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "( , ) fig1a.eps    ( , ) fig1b.eps    because suzaku xis is characterized by a lower background level especially above 3  kev and a higher sensitivity below 1  kev @xcite , we have been able to observe the icm emission beyond @xmath3 region of clusters @xcite .",
    "the clusters observed with suzaku show a similar trend ; the temperature drops to @xmath201/3 of the peak from the center to the outskirts as expected from structure formation scenarios @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the radial entropy profile has a flatter slope compared to that of numerical simulations obtained assuming adiabatic cool gas accretion ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite report a directional dependence of the temperature and entropy in abell 1689 cluster which is considered to reflect the mass flow from the large scale structure filament .",
    "thus , observing the cluster outskirts as a whole , not only the limited direction , is important .    in further outer region , as far as the virial radius",
    ", the intergalactic matter is considered to be not yet mixed with the icm .",
    "it is the highest density component of the warm - hot inter galactic medium ( whim , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which is thought to exist along the large - scale structure as filaments",
    ". the whim would be also the most promising candidate for the `` missing baryons '' , which play key roles for investigating the inconsistency between the baryon density in the local universe and the distant universe ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "although it is difficult to detect the whim with current detectors such as ccd cameras ( e.g.  suzaku xis ) , if observed , its thermal and chemical properties would provide rich information on the structure formation and evolution of the universe .",
    "some challenging observations have given a constraint on the upper limit of the whim emission .",
    "high resolution imaging spectroscopy with chandra and xmm - newton is claimed to show evidences for the whim emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "their grating observations also make the absorption - line study and restrict the whim density significantly ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies with suzaku have shown that suzaku xis can effectively constrain the galactic emission @xcite better than previous satellites .",
    "therefore , suzaku also has a great advantage in the whim search , because a reliable estimation of the foreground galactic emission is of utmost important in constraining the whim emission .",
    "although @xcite detect no significant redshifted o lines from the outer region of abell  2218 with suzaku , they set a strict constraint on the intensity ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "the range above 7.1 kev was also ignored because the ni line ( @xmath94 kev ) in the background left a spurious feature after the nxb subtraction at large radii . in the simultaneous fits of the bi and fi data , only the normalization parameter was allowed to vary .",
    "we assumed the cxb and two galactic emissions , local hot bubble ( lhb ) and milky way halo ( mwh ) as the back- and fore- ground emissions in @xmath43 and a thermal ( icm ) model for the inner region of the virial radius as follows ( hereafter model i ) ;    * model i : apec@xmath95    although there was no flare in the solar - wind flux during our observation , because the swcx and lhb could be hardly distinguished with a limited spectral resolution of ccds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we modeled the sum of the swcx and the lhb as a single unabsorbed thermal plasma .",
