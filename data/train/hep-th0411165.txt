    ", we will explain these points in some detail .",
    "for this purpose , we start with an explanation of some relevant aspects of the tod - hitchin metrics .",
    "tod and hitchin constructed a family of asd einstein metrics ( tod - hitchin metrics ) on the bianchi ix orbifold , parameterized by an integer @xmath48 @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these solutions are written in the triaxial form and have a compactification as metrics with orbifold singularities .",
    "these may be thought of as a resolution of the curvature singularity in the asd taub - nut de - sitter metric @xmath39 .",
    "each tod - hitchin metric @xmath49 is given by a solution to the painlev vi equation ( see appendix b ) .",
    "for lower @xmath13 the metric takes the form @xcite@xcite :    * @xmath50 @xmath51 which gives the standard metric on s@xmath52 written in the triaxial form .",
    "* @xmath53 @xmath54 which gives the fubini - study metric on @xmath55 .",
    "* @xmath56   + the metric can be written as @xmath57 where the components are given for @xmath58 @xmath59 and for @xmath60 @xmath61    among the tod - hitchin metrics , those with @xmath50 and @xmath62 are exceptional , i.e. there is no singularity .",
    "the solutions with higher @xmath13 are determined by the non - trivial solutions to the painlev equation , and in the limit @xmath63 together with a suitable scaling of @xmath28 the solution approaches the atiyah - hitchin metric . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "hitchin found a systematic algebraic way of finding solutions of the painlev equation .",
    "however , it is not easy to write down these solutions explicitly . to examine such a solution",
    ", we consider the local metric near the boundary by using expansions of the solution ( [ bianchi ix ] ) to the einstein equation .    to begin with , we discuss boundary conditions .",
    "let us impose a compact condition for the bianchi ix manifold @xmath64so(3 ) , where @xmath65 is the closed interval @xmath66\\subset { { \\mathbb r}}$ ] .",
    "furthermore we require that singularities at the boundaries , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are described by bolts or nuts so that there are three types , nut  nut , bolt  nut and bolt  bolt .",
    "the tod - hitchin metric belongs to bolt  bolt type : near @xmath69 , the metric is written as @xmath70 on the other hand , near @xmath71 @xmath72 it should be noticed that at one side of the boundaries the coefficient of @xmath73 vanishes , while at the other side it is the coefficient of @xmath74 that vanishes .",
    "the constant @xmath75 in ( [ t_1 ] ) is fixed by the asd condition as @xmath76 the asymptotic forms ( [ t_1 ] ) and ( [ t_2 ] ) imply that the metric has an orbifold singularity with angle @xmath77 around @xmath78 at @xmath69 , and extends smoothly over @xmath78 at @xmath71 .",
    "the principal orbits are so(3)/(@xmath79 ) and hence the tod - hitchin metrics are defined on @xmath80 \\cup { { \\mathbb{rp}}}^2 $ ] , which is topologically equivalent to @xmath81 @xcite@xcite . the taub - nut de - sitter metric @xmath39 near the boundary @xmath42 coincides with the asymptotic form ( [ t_1 ] ) , by setting @xmath82 .",
    "however , the metric on the other boundary @xmath43 is different from ( [ t_2 ] ) , and turns out to have the curvature singularity .",
    "the higher order expansions with the initial conditions ( [ t_1 ] ) and ( [ t_2 ] ) reveal the further structure of the tod - hitchin metric .    using the einstein equation ( see appendix a ) , we find the following asymptotic behavior of the tod - hitchin metric in the form ( [ bianchi ix ] ) near the boundary :    ( 1 ) : :    near @xmath69 @xmath83    here the expansion includes one free parameter @xmath84 ,    and the remaining coefficients are determined by @xmath13 ,    @xmath84 and @xmath75 ( see ( [ m^2 ] ) ) . in this    expansion , the terms multiplied by @xmath84 represent the    deviation from the biaxial form . it should be noticed that the    deviation is `` small '' because of the presence of the suppression    factor @xmath85 .",
    "( 2 ) : :    near @xmath71 @xmath86    here the expansion includes one free parameter @xmath8 , and    the asd condition requires @xmath87 the    remaining coefficients are successively determined .",
    "the tod - hitchin metric corresponds to that with a certain value @xmath84 in ( [ near t_1 ] ) or @xmath8 in ( [ near t_2 ] ) ; the determination of these values requires the global information connecting the local solutions near the boundaries , which is lacking in our analysis ( see figure [ fig : fig.2.eps ] ) .",
    "in particular , for the exact solutions ( [ exact1])-([exact2 ] ) , the parameters @xmath88 are given by    ( a ) : :    @xmath50  :    @xmath89 ( b ) : :    @xmath53  :    @xmath90 ( c ) : :    @xmath58  :    @xmath91 ( d ) : :    @xmath60  :    @xmath92    when we consider the case with large @xmath13 , the expansion ( [ near t_1 ] ) implies that the biaxial solutions approximate well the tod - hitchin metrics near the boundary @xmath69 .",
    "we find that the asd taub - nut de - sitter solution @xmath39 exactly reproduces the expansion ( [ near t_1 ] ) with @xmath93 . in the limit @xmath94 , the equation ( [ near t_1 ] ) yields @xmath95 , which is consistent with the asymptotic behavior of the atiyah - hitchin metric",
    "indeed , the atiyah - hitchin metric behaves like the asd taub - nut metric with exponentially - small corrections @xcite .",
    "the atiyah - hitchin manifold is identified as the moduli space of the three - dimensional @xmath96 su(2 ) gauge theory@xcite@xcite .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of bosonic fields of the theory , three so(3 ) scalars @xmath97 and one scalar @xmath98 dual of photon , parameterize the atiyah - hitchin manifold .",
    "the hyperkhler structure of the atiyah - hitchin manifold ensures the @xmath96 supersymmetry . in the region of large @xmath99",
    ", the monopole correction is suppressed and the moduli is well approximated by the taub - nut geometry with a negative charge .",
    "on the other hand , near the origin , the tod - hitchin geometry provides a good approximation even if @xmath13 is small , and thus one can expect that the gauge theory near the origin of the moduli is well described by that with the tod - hitchin geometry as the moduli . in this approximation ,",
    "the metric on the moduli becomes simpler but the gauge theory fails to be supersymmetric .",
    "this is because the tod - hitchin geometry is not khler , while the atiyah - hitchin manifold is hyperkhler .",
    "as we have seen , the tod - hitchin geometry converges to the atiyah - hitchin manifold in the limit , @xmath44 together with @xmath45 .",
    "it is interesting to consider the gauge theory with the tod - hitchin geometry as the moduli and to reveal the role of the limit . in this limit ,",
    "the supersymmetry recovers and the moduli becomes non compact by sending the orbifold singularity of the tod - hitchin geometry to infinity",
    ". on the other hand , to study the region near the orbifold singularity , it will be useful to examine the theory with the taub - nut de sitter geometry as the moduli .",

    "the left - invariant one - forms @xmath109 are defined by @xmath110 and so the equation ( [ connec ] ) may be written as @xmath111 by using the adjoint representation @xmath112 . given a metric @xmath113 on so(3 ) , then the kaluza - klein metric on @xmath11 takes the form ,    @xmath114    the einstein equation can be solved by imposing the following conditions :    ( 1 ) : :    @xmath115 is an so(3 ) yang - mills instanton on    @xmath100 .",

    "putting @xmath147 we find @xmath148 for @xmath149 , and @xmath150 for @xmath151 .",
    "these expressions correspond to the asymptotic forms ( [ t_1 ] ) and ( [ t_2 ] ) of the tod - hitchin metric .",
    "an important difference is that the collapsing circle is twisted by the fiber so(3 ) , which allows us to resolve the orbifold singularity of @xmath100 as shown below .",
    "let us represent the invariant one - forms @xmath152 in terms of euler s angles : @xmath153 the following transformation @xmath154 yields @xmath155 for @xmath149 .",

    "it follows that one can adjust the ranges of the new angles as @xmath157 , @xmath158 since euler s angles have the ranges @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
