    "the basic idea of engineering dissipative environments to prepare interesting quantum states @xcite has been extended to the preparation of entangled quantum states @xcite . nowadays , a plethora of dissipative quantum state preparation schemes has emerged , where the steady state of the system shows the peculiar feature of quantum entanglement , despite or rather just because being subject to the influence of environmental decoherence . in",
    "most of them the environment is engineered by applying active driving of the systems by microwaves or lasers .",
    "such active schemes exist for many different physical systems , like ions in traps @xcite , atoms in cavities @xcite , ensembles of atoms @xcite , directly coupled solid state qubits @xcite and solid state qubits in resonators @xcite . however , there are also passive schemes @xcite , where the steady state of the system can be reached without external driving . in these schemes",
    "the interaction between the systems constituents ensures an entangled steady state .    in this manuscript",
    "we also examine a passive scheme .",
    "we are interested in how steady state entanglement can be enhanced in the simplest bipartite system .",

    "controllable two - level systems appear for example in experiments with artificial atoms in superconducting solid state systems @xcite , where parameters like the eigenfrequency can be tuned . due to this engineering of an environment",

    "we only vary coupling parameters and eigenfrequencies . in this way",
    ", we obtain a practical scheme for preparing entangled states or storing entanglement in presence of a decohering environment .",
    "an additional peculiarity is the treatment of the coupling between our dissipative ancilla @xmath0 and the systems @xmath9 and @xmath1 without any further approximations .",

    "[ result ] , we study how to find parameters of the ancilla to enhance the steady state entanglement via dissipation . in section [ dsoe ]",
    "we connect this effect to the dissipative preparation of energy eigenstates .",

    "( [ 2qneg ] ) tells us immediately , that for a maximal entanglement of @xmath44 we need a coupling strength of @xmath45 .",
    "hence the steady state entanglement in the @xmath46 system should be observable in a strong coupling regime @xcite , where the coupling strength @xmath5 is almost equal to unity .",

    "unfortunately , in this case we have no similarly simple expression for the negativity as eq .",
    "( [ 2qneg ] ) , telling us if the sign of a parameter is of importance or not .",
    "a numerical study shows that the sign of the system - ancilla coupling strength @xmath6 is of no importance , but to find local maxima in the steady state entanglement @xmath50 , it is necessary that the intra - system coupling strength @xmath5 is negative .    this enhancement effect in bipartite entanglement",
    "occurs passively by just adding the dissipative ancilla .",
    "we have no active driving elements , like an external laser pumping a specific transition , in our system .",
    "spontaneous decay is present in all three subsystems @xmath9 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 . yet , as in the case @xmath58 for an uncoupled bipartite system , the steady state @xmath60 is still entangled and this bipartite entanglement can even be enhanced . through the coupling of ancilla @xmath0 to our bipartite system @xmath46 , we obviously increase the space of possible steady states , which can be reached dynamically .",
    "moreover , we retain the full quantum character of this dynamics , as we trace out the dissipative ancilla @xmath0 without further approximations .      in order to fully bring out the importance of the ancilla @xmath0 coupled to a bath we turn the pike and",
    "fix the eigenfrequency @xmath54 and the coupling strength @xmath55 while varying @xmath8 .",

    "[ gammacn ] .     in dependence of the decoherence rate @xmath8 .",
    "the parameters @xmath54 , @xmath61 , @xmath56 and @xmath43 are kept constant . only for values of @xmath62",
    "the enhancement effect ceases to exist and the entanglement in the uncoupled system of @xmath63 ( black dashed line ) is superior . ]",
    "starting form a small @xmath8 the entanglement increases rapidly to an extremal value of @xmath64 at @xmath65 to then decrease again .",
    "however , we find the enhanced entanglement over a wide range of dissipation until we reach @xmath62 , where the enhancement ceases to exist . in this case the maximal entanglement may only be obtained by decoupling the dissipative ancilla .",
    "nevertheless , in the large regime studied here , more decoherence , as measured by @xmath8 , leads to more entanglement ( black dot in fig .",
    "[ figjneg ] , for @xmath66 ) is not fixed in the @xmath67 parameter space , if we vary the decoherence parameter @xmath8 .",
    "if one determines the optimal values @xmath4 and @xmath6 for every @xmath8 dynamically , a curve can be plotted that shows how the maximal entanglement @xmath50 depends on the decoherence parameter @xmath8 .",
    "we omit this plot here , as it is qualitatively equivalent to fig .",
    "[ gammacn ] . ] between @xmath9 and @xmath1 .    in a realistic scenario",
    ", @xmath8 is not a parameter to be engineered .",
    "in contrast to the eigenfrequencies and coupling strengths , that may be tunable , depending on the actual physical realization of the system @xcite , one can not simply change the rate of decoherence . yet , one could think of methods to increase the spontaneous decay of an artificial atom , for example by placing it in a more or less resonant cavity , that is lossy itself .",
    "so , at least in principle , it should be possible to influence @xmath8 to some degree and thereby maximize the entanglement enhancement effect observed here .",
    "on the other hand , even if the decoherence parameter @xmath8 may not be tuned , still fig .",
    "[ gammacn ] tells us that there is a broad range of possible decoherence parameters @xmath8 for which the enhancement effect should be observable .",
    "thus , arguing from a more fundamental point of view , our setup could also be used to put the decoherence model included in the calculation of this quantum effect to a test . in our model",
    "all three systems @xmath9 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are coupled to individual heat baths .",
    "their interaction in presence of environments leads to the entanglement enhancement effect .",
    "if this is only an artifact of our model , that does not appear in a real system , this model can not be used to describe intricate quantum effects of decoherence properly .",
    "to understand the observed effect of entanglement enhancement further , we study how the entangled steady state is dissipatively prepared @xcite , starting from the initial state @xmath68 where subsystem @xmath9 is in the excited state @xmath69 , while @xmath1 and the dissipative ancilla @xmath0 are in their ground states @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "actually , the steady state solution @xmath71 does not depend on the initial state and hence every choice will lead to the same result after more or less rich dynamics .",
    "here we have chosen just one generic example of an initial state to exemplify how the steady state is reached in time .",
    "in fact we will see that the dissipative dynamics selects a specific eigenstate @xmath72 of the undamped three - particle interaction , described by the solution of @xmath73 with hamiltonians given by eqs .",
    "( [ hfree ] ) and ( [ hinteraction ] ) . in order to trace this selection process",
    "in the course of time , we regard the fidelities @xmath74 of the time evolved state @xmath75 , eq .",
    "( [ louivillian ] ) , and the eigenstates @xmath72 .",
    "the natural expectation would be that a dissipative time evolution finally drives the three - particle system into its ground state @xmath76 .",
    "this is what we basically observe in fig .",
    "[ es1a ] for the parameter set @xmath77 representing the parameter regime also depicted in fig . [ figjpos ] of the previous section .",
    "starting from the initial state , eq .",
    "( [ inist ] ) , we first observe a transient dynamics , which afterwards merges into the steady state solution .",
    "the special fact to be observed in fig .",
    "[ es1a ] is the mixture in the steady state , as depicted in the inset .",
    "we see that besides the expected major contribution of the corresponding ground state @xmath76 , we still have a small fraction of higher lying eigenstates .",
    "hence we can approximate the steady state density operator by @xmath78 which carries the negativity @xmath79 for the @xmath46 system in state @xmath80 $ ] and hence nicely approximates the typical negativities shown in fig .",
    "[ figjpos ] .    if we now choose the parameter set @xmath81 for which we observed the maximal enhancement effect in the previous section , we recognize a very similar transient dynamics in fig .",
    "[ es1b ] , leading to a strong contribution of the ground state @xmath76 .",
    "however , the selection of the higher energy eigenstates changes : @xmath82 is suppressed at the expense of @xmath76 , but the state @xmath83 survives , so that we arrive at the approximate density operator @xmath84 which indeed leads to the enhanced negativity @xmath85 , seen in fig .",
    "[ gammacn ] . obviously , the change in composition of energy eigenstates in the steady state , explains why entanglement is enhanced by dissipatively coupling an ancilla to systems @xmath9 and @xmath1 with a suitable choice of parameters .",
    "however , the enhancement is still rather small since the ground state @xmath76 dominates this composition .",
    "the question then is whether we can even select an eigenstate , like the surviving state @xmath83 , with a much higher degree of @xmath46 entanglement by choosing the right set of parameters .",
    "thus we can try to look at the problem from a fully engineering perspective in the next section .      in principle ,",
    "all eigenfrequencies and coupling strengths , and with limitations also the decoherence parameters , are adjustable . in other words , the steady state of the full liouvillian , eq .",
    "( [ louivillian ] ) , is a function of the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath8 .",
    "as explained in section [ startingp ] , with regard to experiment , we fix the reasonable choice @xmath43 .",
    "next we constrain the remaining parameters by @xmath87 these constraints are justified , as we consider similar two - level systems with comparable eigenfrequencies and decoherence parameters . also , to stay in a physically reasonable parameter regime , the interaction strengths are bounded .    numerically solving this constrained optimization problem , i.e. finding the steady state solution of eq .",
    "( [ louivillian ] ) with maximal bipartite entanglement @xmath50 between systems @xmath9 and @xmath1 , yields a maximum of @xmath88 for the optimal parameter set @xmath89 the maximal entanglement @xmath90 is quite an improvement over the maximal entanglement of @xmath63 in the uncoupled case . at the same time it is again crucial that the ancilla is dissipative , see fig .",
    "[ 04gammacn ] .",
    "the maximum at @xmath91 is surrounded by broad sides , where the entanglement is still enhanced .",
    "for very small and large values of the decoherence parameter @xmath8 , the entanglement drops below @xmath63 .",

    "as already mentioned in the previous section , this improvement in entanglement can be explained in more detail , if we once again look at the dynamical selection of eigenstates for @xmath95 . in fig .",

    "in this manuscript we have studied how to enhance the steady state entanglement between two two - level systems , by coupling them to a dissipative ancilla .",
    "this ancilla has also been chosen to be a two - level system , subject to the same spontaneous decay noise like the other systems .",
    "we have found an enhancement effect in entanglement , depending on the coupling strength , eigenfrequency and decoherence parameter of the ancilla . as we have no active driving elements present",
    ", the enhancement occurs passively .",
    "also , the interaction with the dissipative ancilla has been treated without any approximations , i.e. the result contains the full quantum dynamics of the interaction between system and ancilla .",
    "we have shown that the enhancement effect is intimately connected to the composition of the steady state , that we expressed in terms of eigenstates of the undamped three - particle system .",
    "coupling a dissipative ancilla has allowed us to alter this composition significantly , enabling the enhancement of entanglement .",
    "the optimal parameters , determined at last , show that a remarkably large enhancement is possible .",
    "the associated mixed steady state represents the optimized result of a dissipative state preparation , with respect to the restriction of fixed coupling and lindblad operators .",
    "since we have started from an experimentally motivated model , a realization of a related setup might be within reach , establishing the possibility to exploit the observed enhancement effect to engineer entangled states .",
    "moreover , an experimental approach will shed additional light on our theoretical concepts for the description of decoherence .",
    "the more or less phenomenological modeling of spontaneous decay as primary source of decoherence is crucial for the appearance of the enhancement effect . in an experiment",
    ", this model would be put to a sensitive test . beyond that , extensions of the decoherence model , for example regarding finite temperature heat baths or adding additional dephasing noise , are possibilities of further studies .",
    "in addition , due to the model s simplicity and the symmetries involved , at least in some regimes an analytical treatment might be within reach .",
    "this could for example be used to study , if there is an even more fundamental mechanism behind the selection of eigenstates explaining the enhancement effect .",
