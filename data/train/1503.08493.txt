    "let us denote the eigenvalues of @xmath3 by @xmath5 where eigenvalues are written with multiplicities .",
    "let us fix @xmath1 and consider eigenvalues as functionals on the space of all riemannian metrics .",
    "these functionals possess the following rescaling property , @xmath6 thus , in order to get scale - invariant functionals on the space of riemannian metrics one has to normalize eigenvalues . the most natural way to do it is to multiply by the area , so we consider the following functionals @xmath7 in the present paper we are concerned only with the @xmath8 .",
    "in further exposition we use the notation @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a manifold with boundary . in this case , the neumann boundary conditions on @xmath11 are implied and everything stated above remains true .",

    "however , their argument contained a miscalculation , yielding the existence of a map of even degree from a non - orientable surface @xmath1 to a projective space , which contradicted hurwitz identities ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in case the genus of @xmath1 was even .",
    "in the present paper we modify their ideas and obtain an improved upper bound .",

    ". thus inequality  ( [ yy ] ) guarantees that this value is finite for orientable surfaces while theorem  [ maintheorem ] asserts the same for non - orientable surfaces .",
    "it is known that for a sphere supremum is equal to @xmath20 and is achieved on a round metric , see  @xcite .",
    "recently , the value of this quantity has been found for a projective plane ( see  @xcite ) , a torus ( see  @xcite ) and a klein bottle ( see  @xcite ) . up to a computer calculation",
    "the result is known for an orientable surface of genus @xmath17 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "let us also mention a series of works on extremal metrics for functionals @xmath21 on torus and klein bottle  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ confvol ]",
    "we give a defnition of conformal volume and outline some of its properties . in section  [ prelim ]",
    "we explain the main idea of the proof of theorem  [ maintheorem ] .",
    "section  [ algem ] contains some facts about the geometry of real curves that are necessary for the proof .",
    "finally in sections  [ final ] and  [ hyperelliptic ] we prove theorems  [ maintheorem ] and  [ gamma2 ] .",
    "in the paper  @xcite the authors introduced the concept of conformal volume @xmath22 for any riemannian surface @xmath23 , possibly with boundary .",
    "it is defined by the following min - max formula @xmath24 where @xmath25 ranges over all possible conformal mappings @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a group of conformal diffeomorphisms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a volume element associated to the metric ( possibly degenerate ) @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the canonical metric on the sphere .",
    "the next theorem is a compilation of results from  @xcite that allow us to immediately present a proof of inequality  ( [ yy ] ) given in  @xcite .",

    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 for any choice of metrics @xmath2 and @xmath41 .",
    "let us remind the reader that if @xmath42 is not empty then @xmath43 denotes the first non - trivial neumann eigenvalue of laplacian on @xmath1 .    using this theorem it is easy to prove inequlaity  ( [ yy ] ) .",
    "indeed it is a known fact ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) that for any orientable riemannian surface of genus @xmath0 there is a conformal map to the sphere of degree at most @xmath44 $ ]",
    ". then combination of items @xmath17 and @xmath45 from the theorem completes the proof .    it is natural to try to do the same for a non - orientable surface , where one replaces the sphere @xmath46 with the projective space @xmath47 .",
    "this is an approach proposed in  @xcite .",
    "however as we discussed in the introduction the argument presented there contains an error .",
    "moreover , we were not able to find in the literature an answer to the question whether there exists a conformal map @xmath48 for a given non - orientable surface @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that it is more convenient to use a disk instead of @xmath49 in the aforementioned argument .",
    "the reasoning for that comes from a theory of real curves and will be explained below in section  [ algem ] .",
    "let @xmath50 be a double cover of @xmath1 , where @xmath51 is an orientable surface of genus @xmath0 .",
    "we endow @xmath51 with the metric @xmath52 and the corresponding conformal structure .",
    "then @xmath53 can be seen as a factorization of @xmath51 by a free isometric involution @xmath54 that acts by exchanging the sheets of the cover @xmath53 .",
    "[ prelim ]    since @xmath55 is an isometry , one has @xmath56 and therefore there is a common basis of eigenfunction for these operators .",

    "let us denote by @xmath57 the first even non - trivial eigenvalue of @xmath3 on @xmath51 .",
    "then one observes that @xmath58 .",
    "assume @xmath59 is a conformally branched covering of degree @xmath33 .",
    "yang and yau in their paper introduced a procedure of pushing forward a metric @xmath2 on @xmath51 to a metric @xmath60 on @xmath46 with isolated conical singularities at branch points of @xmath61 .",
    "[ push ] let @xmath61 be a conformally branched covering @xmath59",
    ". then preimage of a suitable neighbourhood @xmath62 of a non - branching point @xmath63 is a collection of @xmath33 disks @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the restriction @xmath66 to each disk is a diffeomorphism .",
    "the push - forward metric @xmath60 on @xmath62 is defined as a sum @xmath67 .    in their paper yang and yau",
    "proved the following theorem for the metric @xmath60 .",
    "for any function @xmath68 one has the following @xmath69 and @xmath70    yang and yau used this theorem to prove an upper bound for @xmath71 . here",
    "we adapt their approach to prove an upper bound for @xmath57 .",
    "suppose that there is a conformal involution @xmath72 of a sphere such that @xmath61 satisfies the following relation @xmath73    the transformation @xmath72 is an isometry of @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath64 and @xmath75 be as in definition  [ push ] , i.e. @xmath76 . applying @xmath55 to this equality and using relation  ( [ tau ] ) we obtain @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be restrictions of @xmath61 on @xmath79 . then @xmath80 summing these relations over @xmath81 we obtain @xmath82 .",
    "thus we can consider the first @xmath72-even eigenfunction @xmath25 corresponding to @xmath83 .",
    "the function @xmath84 is obviously @xmath55-even and by  ( [ yy1 ] ) the mean of @xmath84 over @xmath51 is @xmath85 .",
    "therefore we can use @xmath84 as a test function in the variational characterization of @xmath86 .",
    "application of  ( [ yy2 ] ) yields @xmath87 as a result , we get an inequality @xmath88 . moreover using equality  ( [ yy1 ] ) for @xmath89",
    "we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "finally , we have @xmath91    to derive theorem  [ maintheorem ] from inequality  ( [ bound ] ) we need to find upper bounds for @xmath33 ( it is done in the following section ) and for @xmath92 ( see section  [ final ] ) .",
    "in this section we explain some terminology from algebraic geometry .",
    "[ algem ]    in algebraic geometry @xmath93 is called a real curve .",
    "the term `` curve '' is used due to the fact that @xmath1 has a structure of 1-dimensional complex manifold .",
    "the reason behind `` real '' is that such a curve can always be embedded in the projective space @xmath94 such that @xmath55 becomes conjugation of the coordinates @xmath95 .",
    "thus the image of the embedding is a zero locus of polynomials with real coefficients .",
    "the fact that @xmath55 has no fixed points corresponds to the statement `` @xmath51 has no real points '' meaning that aforementioned embedding does not intersect the real locus @xmath96 .",
    "then relation  ( [ tau ] ) becomes a definition of a map between real curves @xmath97 .",
    "any conformal automorphism of @xmath46 inversing the orientation is conjugate to either @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "thus without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 be a minimal degree of the map @xmath103 .",
    "then @xmath102 coincides with the so called real gonality of @xmath104 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "let us also denote by @xmath105 a minimal degree of the map @xmath106 .",
    "we deduce theorem  [ maintheorem ] from the following proposition .",
    "[ prop ] let @xmath15 be a non - orientable riemannian surface and @xmath93 is the corresponding double cover",
    ". then one has the inequality @xmath107    we prove this proposition in the following section .    then proposition  [ prop ] together with the following lemma yields theorem  [ maintheorem ] .",
    "if @xmath51 is a real curve of genus @xmath0 then either @xmath108 $ ] or @xmath109 $ ] [ lemma ]    by a well - known theorem , for any riemann surface @xmath110 of genus @xmath0 there exists a holomorphic map @xmath111 of degree @xmath112 $ ] , where @xmath113 is a riemann sphere .",
    "in other words there exists meromorphic function @xmath61 on @xmath110 such that generic point @xmath114 has exactly @xmath33 preimages .    consider a new function @xmath115 .",
    "note that @xmath116 . therefore if @xmath117 then @xmath118 .",
    "moreover @xmath119 since @xmath61 is not identically zero .",

    ". therefore the function @xmath61 satisfies relation  ( [ tau ] ) for @xmath122 .",

    "m. coppens communicated to us that if @xmath135 , then @xmath136 . according to him that can be proved in the same way as theorem  @xmath17 in paper  @xcite . given that statement the inequality in theorem  [ maintheorem ] becomes @xmath137,\\ ] ] in case @xmath135 for some @xmath138 .",
    "let @xmath139 be a map of real curves of degree @xmath140 , i.e. a meromorphic function of degree @xmath140 on @xmath51 that satisfies relation  ( [ tau ] ) for @xmath141 .",
    "[ final ] the fixed point set of @xmath142 is an equator in @xmath46 , therefore @xmath83 can be identified with the first eigenvalue @xmath143 of a hemisphere @xmath144 with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "items 3 and 4 of theorem  [ thconf ] imply that @xmath145 .",
    "since the area of the hemisphere is half the volume of the sphere one has the inequality @xmath146 combining that with inequality  ( [ bound ] ) one obtains @xmath147    let @xmath148 be a map of real curves of degree @xmath149 , i.e. a meromorphic function of degree @xmath149 on @xmath51 that satisfies relation  ( [ tau ] ) for @xmath150 . in this case",
    "@xmath72 is antipodal involution and @xmath83 can be identified with the first eigenvalue of @xmath151 with the induced metric .",
    "theorem  [ thconf ] yields the inequality @xmath152 for any metric @xmath2 .",
    "proceeding as in the previous case we obtain the inequality @xmath153",
    "in case @xmath154 is a hyperelliptic surface ( e.g. @xmath51 is of genus @xmath17 ) it is possible to improve the statement of lemma  [ lemma ] .",
