    "thus , the orthogonality relation @xmath224 and the normalization condition @xmath225 can not be distinguished .",
    "this makes possible the exchange of the two wave functions .",
    "the exchange of the wave functions continues analytically into the function space of discrete states as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : tra3 ] , [ fig : avoi1 ] and [ fig : avoi2 ] .",
    "when the resonance states avoid crossing at @xmath173 , the components of the wave functions do not increase up to infinity .",
    "their increase is reduced due to interferences ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avoi2 ] ) .",
    "the differences @xmath195 jump from 1 to 0 at @xmath173 ( and from about 0 to almost 1 for values of @xmath226 distant from @xmath173 ) when @xmath227 changes its sign ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avoi1 ] ) .",
    "this jump is related to the exchange of the wave functions .",
    "the value @xmath228 at @xmath173 remains unaltered when @xmath229 , i.e. also for discrete states .",
    "therefore , the results shown in fig . [ fig : tra1 ] top and middle correspond to situations being fundamentally and topologically different from one another .",
    "the bi - orthogonality ( [ eq : biorth ] ) of the wave functions is characteristic of the avoided crossing of resonance states .",
    "it increases limitless at the double pole of the @xmath0 matrix and vanishes in the case of an avoided crossing of discrete states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avoi3 ] ) . it does not enter any physically relevant values since it does not enter the @xmath0 matrix , eq .",
    "( [ eq : smatres ] ) .",
    "the wave functions of the resonance states appear in the @xmath0 matrix in accordance with the orthogonality relations ( [ eq : orth ] ) which are fulfilled in the whole function space without any exceptions .",
    "another result of the present study is the influence of the branch points in the complex plane onto the purity of the wave functions @xmath230 . at @xmath173 , the wave functions are not only exchanged but become mixed .",
    "the mixing occurs not only at the critical point @xmath173 but in a certain region around @xmath173 when the crossing is avoided .",
    "this fact is important at high level density where , as a rule , an avoided crossing with another level appears before @xmath231 is reached . as a result , all the wave functions of closely - lying states contain components of all basic states .",
    "that means , they are strongly mixed at high level density ( for illustration see fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] ) .",
    "the strong mixing of the wave functions of a quantum system at high level density means that the information on the individual properties of the discrete states described by the @xmath123 is lost .",
    "while the exchange of the wave functions itself is of no interest for a statistical consideration of the states , the accompanying mixing of the wave functions @xmath160 is decisive for the statistics . at high level density , the number of branch points is relatively large ( although of measure zero ) .",
    "therefore , the ( discrete as well as resonance ) states of quantum systems at high level density do not contain any information on the basic states with wave functions @xmath123 .",
    "it follows further that the statistical properties of quantum systems at high level density are different from those at low level density .",
    "states at the border of the spectrum are almost not influenced by branch points in the complex plane since there are almost no states which could cross or avoid crossing with others states .",
    "the properties of these states are expected therefore to show more individual features than those at high level density . in other words , the information on the individual properties of the states with wave functions @xmath123 at the border of the spectrum is kept to a great deal in contrast to that on the states in the center of the spectrum .",
    "thus , there is an influence of the continuum onto the properties of a ( closed ) quantum system with discrete states due to the analyticity of the wave functions .",
    "the branch points in the complex plane are _ hidden crossings _ , indeed .",
    "they play an important role not only in atoms , as supposed in @xcite , but determine the properties of all ( closed and open ) quantum systems at high level density .",
    "their relation to berry phases has been studied experimentally as well as theoretically @xcite .",
    "+ summarizing the results obtained for quantum systems at high level density with avoided level crossings and double poles of the @xmath0 matrix , it can be stated the following :    1 .",
    "the poles of the @xmath0 matrix correspond to the eigenvalues of a non - hermitian effective hamilton operator also in the case that the resonance states overlap , 2 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamilton operator are bi - orthogonal in the whole function space without any exceptions , 3 .",
    "avoided level crossings in the complex plane as well as in the function space of discrete states can be traced back to the existence of branch points in the complex plane , 4 .   under certain conditions , a branch point in",
    "the complex plane appears as a double pole of the @xmath0 matrix , 5 .",
    "branch points in the complex plane cause an exchange of the wave functions _ and _ create a mixing of the states of a quantum system at high level density even if the system is closed and the states are discrete .",
    "all the results obtained show the strong influence of the branch points in the complex plane on the dynamics of many - level quantum systems .",
    "they cause an avoided overlapping of resonance states which is accompanied by an exchange of the wave functions .",
    "a special case is the avoided level crossing of discrete states known for a long time .",
    "the avoided level crossings cause a mixing of the eigenfunctions of @xmath108 which is the larger the higher the level density is .",
    "the states at the border of the spectrum of a many - particle system are therefore less influenced by avoided level crossings than those in the centre ."
