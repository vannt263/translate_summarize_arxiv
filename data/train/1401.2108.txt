    "the symmetry of a material plays a fundamental role in determining its physical properties .",

    "superconductivity is one of the best examples of a symmetry breaking phenomenon . in conventional superconductors gauge symmetry",
    "is broken , while in unconventional superconductors other symmetries may also be broken .",
    "there has recently been a great deal of interest in non - centrosymmetric superconductors ( ncs ) due to the complex nature of their superconducting properties  @xcite .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry in these materials induces an anti - symmetric spin - orbit coupling ( soc )  @xcite which can lift the degeneracy of the conduction band electrons and may cause the superconducting pair wavefunction to contain mixed singlet - triplet spin states .",
    "this mixed pairing can lead non - centrosymmetric superconductors to display significantly different properties from conventional superconducting systems e.g. nodes in the superconducting gap and upper critical fields exceeding the pauli limiting field  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some of these systems display time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) breaking .",
    "one of the most direct ways of confirming the presence of an unconventional superconducting state is muon spectroscopy  @xcite . in a muon spectroscopy experiment ,",
    "100% spin - polarized positive muons are implanted one at a time into a sample . after coming to rest the muon spin precesses in the local magnetic environment . the muons decay with a half - life of @xmath5s , emitting a positron preferentially in the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay .",
    "the number of positrons are recorded as a function of time in forward , @xmath6 , and backward , @xmath7 , detectors .",
    "the time evolution of the muon polarization can be obtained by examining the normalized difference of these two functions via the asymmetry function @xmath8 .",
    "this technique can accurately determine the magnetic penetration depth and hence the temperature dependence of the superfluid density , yielding information on the symmetry of the superconducting gap .",
    "muon spectroscopy can also be used to unambiguously establish the onset of time - reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors .",
    "the magnetic moments associated with the cooper pairs are non - zero in such superconductors and a local alignment of these moments produces spontaneous , but extremely small , internal magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "muon spin relaxation / rotation ( @xmath1sr ) is especially sensitive to small changes in internal fields and can easily measure fields of @xmath9 t which correspond to moments that are just a few hundredths of a @xmath10 .",
    "time - reversal symmetry breaking is rare and has only been observed directly in a few unconventional superconductors , e.g. sr@xmath11ruo@xmath12  @xcite , upt@xmath13 and ( u , th)be@xmath14  @xcite , ( pr , la)(os , ru)@xmath12sb@xmath15  @xcite , prpt@xmath12ge@xmath15  @xcite , and laniga@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of singlet - triplet pairing in non - centrosymmetric superconductors makes them prime candidates to exhibit trs breaking . to date , however , the only ncs reported to show trs breaking is lanic@xmath11  @xcite . in this material",

    "however , no spontaneous fields were observed in the superconducting state of any of these materials indicating that the breaking of trs is either absent or undetectable in these materials .",
    "the failure to detect trs breaking in a number of ncs containing heavy transition metals in which soc is normally expected to be strong and in which mixed spin - singlet spin - triplet pairing may be allowed , raises the possibility that trs breaking may be absent in this particular class of superconductors . in order to address this question",

    "the signal decays with time because of the inhomogeneous field distribution of the flux - line lattice .",
    "the tf spectra were fitted using a sinusoidal oscillating function with a gaussian relaxation , and an oscillatory background term arising from the muons implanted directly into the silver sample holder that do not depolarize .",
    "@xmath36 exhibits no field dependence between 40 and 60 mt , as expected for a material with a @xmath53 of 12.2  t. figure  [ tfdata]b shows the @xmath54 dependence of the muon depolarization rate which can be directly related to the superfluid density  @xcite . from this , the nature of the superconducting gap can be determined .",
    "the data can be well modeled by a single isotropic @xmath3-wave gap of @xmath55  mev .",
    "this gives a gap of @xmath56 , which is higher than the 3.53 expected for bcs superconductors .",

    "give a time independent background .",
    "there is no indication of a precessional signal over the entire temperature range studied , ruling out the possibility of a large internal field and hence long - range magnetic order in re@xmath0zr . in the absence of atomic moments ,",
    "the only possibility is that the muon spin relaxation is due to static , randomly oriented local fields associated with the nuclear moments at the muon site .",
    "this depolarization can be described by the kubo - toyabe function @xmath61 and our spectra for re@xmath0zr are well described by the function @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the initial asymmetry , @xmath64 is the background , and @xmath60 is the electronic relaxation rate .    the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath60 , and @xmath64 are found to be temperature independent .",

    "[ lfresults ] ) .",
    "such behavior is unusual . to date",
    ", such a change in @xmath59 has only been observed in superconducting pros@xmath12sb@xmath15 and prpt@xmath12ge@xmath15  @xcite , and more recently in laniga@xmath11  @xcite , none of which are ncs .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath59 agrees with a bcs order parameter .",
    "this increase in @xmath59 can be explained in terms of a signature of a coherent internal field with a very low frequency as discussed by aoki  _ et al_.  @xcite for pros@xmath12sb@xmath15 .",
    "they suggest that the field distribution is gaussian in nature compared to sr@xmath11ruo@xmath12 , where @xmath60 exhibits a spontaneous increase below @xmath4 due to a lorentzian - type field distribution . in order to rule out the possibility that the increased relaxation in the superconducting state is due to extrinsic effects such as impurities , measurements were performed in weak longitudinal fields ( fig .",
    "[ lfdata ] ) . a longitudinal magnetic field of just 10  mt removes any relaxation due to the spontaneous fields and is sufficient to fully decouple the muons from this relaxation channel .",
    "this in turn shows that the associated magnetic fields are in fact static or quasi - static on the time scale of the muon precession .",
    "these observations confirm time - reversal symmetry breaking in re@xmath0zr in the superconducting state .",

    ", soc induces a triplet component , @xmath69 , that can be as small as @xmath7025% or as large as @xmath70167% of the total gap energy for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the pairing mechanism in this family is believed to be conventional for all values of @xmath73 and pairing is thus thought to preserve all the lattice symmetries including trs .",
    "in contrast , the breaking of time - reversal symmetry necessitates a superconducting instability in a higher - dimensional irreducible representation of the crystal s point group .",
    "such a state breaks additional lattice symmetries in addition to trs .",
    "this rules out any conventional pairing mechanism , as it would necessarily lead to an order parameter in the most symmetric irreducible representation of the crystal point group , @xmath74 .",
    "the results presented here make re@xmath34zr only the second ncs where broken trs has been observed directly .",
    "moreover the other known example , lanic@xmath18  @xcite , has a crystal point group , @xmath75 , whose irreducible representations are all one - dimensional .",
    "it has thus been argued that for lanic@xmath18 the orbital and spin degrees of freedom must be approximately decoupled at the instability , so that pairing takes place in an almost purely triplet channel , rather than a mixed singlet - triplet one  @xcite .",
