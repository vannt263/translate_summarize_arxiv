    "significant advances have been made in nitride based lasers , record - high temperature operation quantum dot lasers , and the field of nanolasers with ultralow volume and threshold is coming to technological maturity  @xcite .",
    "of special importance for next generation applications such as laser radars , is the design of photonically integrated semiconductor laser arrays that consist of a very large number of properly coupled photonic emitters  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that phase locking of an array of diode lasers is a highly effective method in beam shaping because it increases the output power and reduces the overall needed lasing threshold .",
    "recent work on phase - locked laser arrays through global antenna mutual coupling has employed custom made nano - lasers  @xcite .",
    "moreover , reconfigurable semiconductor laser networks based on diffractive coupling using talbot geometry have been studied on commercially available vertical cavity diode lasers  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we are interested in the collective behavior of a large array of semiconductor lasers with nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "the crucial parameters for the observed dynamics are the coupling strength and the relative optical frequency detuning between the lasers , which introduces realistic inhomogeneities into the system .",
    "our focus , in particular , is to identify the parameter regions where chimera states emerge and subsequently characterize these states using suitable classification measures  @xcite .",
    "chimera states were first reported for identical and symmetrically coupled phase oscillators in  @xcite . for over a decade now , a number of works has been dedicated to this phenomenon of coexisting synchronous and asynchronous oscillatory behavior ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "the latest developments in this field involve their study in physical , higher - dimensional systems beyond phase oscillators , their experimental verification  @xcite , their robustness against system inhomogeneities  @xcite , their existence in stochastic systems  @xcite , and their manipulation through control techniques  @xcite .",
    "coupled lasers have been extensively studied in terms of nonlinear dynamics @xcite and  @xcite ( with references therein ) and synchronization phenomena  @xcite , but works on chimera states in laser networks have appeared only recently . in  @xcite chimera states",
    "were reported both theoretically and experimentally in a virtual space - time representation of a single laser system subject to long delayed feedback .",
    "furthermore , so - called `` small chimeras '' were numerically observed in a network of four globally delay - coupled lasers in  @xcite , for both small and large delays .",
    "such chimeras exist for very small network sizes and do not require nonlocal coupling in order to emerge .",
    "in our study we use neither nonlocal , nor global coupling but simple nearest - neighbor interactions which is physically plausible for lasers , e.  g. , grown on a single chip .",
    "this coupling realization is less expensive computationally .",
    "moreover , it revises the general belief that nonlocal coupling is essential for the existence of chimeras  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the crucial parameter for the collective behavior in our system is the frequency detuning between the coupled lasers .",
    "the effect of detuning has been examined before in  @xcite but with respect to in- and anti - phase synchronization .",

    "one case is full synchronization , where @xmath50 holds for all lasers @xmath51 ( see fig.[fig_4](a ) , bottom ) .",
    "the behavior is therefore similar to that of the uncoupled system since the whole array ends up in the steady state ( each laser is lasing with constant intensity equal to @xmath52 ) . in a partially synchronized state",
    "the amplitudes are different in one or more lasers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_4](b ) , bottom ) and in the unsynchronized state there is no fixed amplitude relation between the oscillators ( see fig .",

    "recently , kemeth _",

    "for measuring spatial coherence , in particular , they introduced a quantity called _ local curvature _ which may be calculated at each time instance .",
    "this is done by applying the discrete laplacian @xmath53 on the spatial data of the amplitude of the electric field : @xmath54 in the synchronization regime the local curvature is close to zero while in the asynchronous regime it is finite and fluctuating .",
    "therefore , if @xmath55 is the normalized probability density function of @xmath56 , @xmath57 measures the relative size of spatially coherent regions in each temporal realization . for a fully synchronized system @xmath58 , while for a totally incoherent system it holds that @xmath59 .",

    "complementary to the local curvature we also calculate the spatial extent occupied by the coherent lasers which is given by the following integral : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a threshold value distinguishing between coherence and incoherence which is related to the maximum curvature and is system - dependent",
    ". we will apply these measures in order to classify the observed patterns and we will discuss their dependence on the coupling strength @xmath49 and the detuning parameter @xmath43 .    figure  [ fig_5 ] shows the spatio - temporal evolution of the local curvature corresponding to the states of fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] . in the fully synchronized case",
    "the local curvature is equal to zero ( fig.[fig_5](a ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](b ) we have the case of an amplitude - chimera state .",
    "we see that this is not a stationary pattern since the local curvature oscillates in time .",
    "the fully incoherent states is shown in fig.[fig_5](c ) , where the local curvature attains higher values .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] , the time evolution @xmath65 for all three cases of fig.[fig_5 ] is plotted .",
    "we see that for the case of fig.[fig_5](b ) @xmath66 oscillates in an irregular manner , and therefore the corresponding amplitude chimera states are _ turbulent _ according to the classification of  @xcite .",
    "the other two curves ( a ) and ( c ) refer to full synchronization and full incoherence , respectively .",
    "apart from the detuning , the coupling strength has also an effect on the synchronization patterns observed in our system . in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] the temporal mean of @xmath65 ( averaged over @xmath67 ) is plotted in the ( @xmath68 ) parameter space .",
    "the initial conditions of the phases are randomly distributed between @xmath69 and @xmath41 , while for the electric field amplitudes and the population inversions they are chosen identical for all lasers : @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",

    "it is clear , that the parameter space is separated in two main domains , one of @xmath72 values close to unity which corresponds to full coherence and contains point ( a ) , and one of @xmath72 values tending to zero which corresponds to full incoherence and contains point ( c ) . on the boundary between these two areas , lies a small region where the amplitude chimeras arise .",
    "note that , due to multistability , the mapping of the dynamical patterns may slightly change with different choice of initial conditions .",
    "the qualitative result , however , will be the same .",
    "for example , in fig.[fig_8 ] ( a ) , we plot @xmath72 for a system with all initial phases randomly distributed but fixed , except those of laser 50 and 150 , which we vary from @xmath60 to @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , the exact values of @xmath72 change but remain within the range allowing for chimera states .    finally , the question of system size is addressed . in our simulations",
    "we observe that the behavior of the system does not change significantly when increasing @xmath0 from @xmath36 to @xmath74 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig_8 ] ( b ) .",
    "after @xmath75 the temporal mean @xmath76 remains constant in time .",

    "in conclusion , we have found amplitude chimera states in a large one - dimensional network of semiconductor lasers by properly modifying the optical frequency detuning .",
    "local coupling is sufficient to generate these states . by using suitable classification measures",
    "we have quantified the observed dynamics . due to the system",
    "s multistability , even a slight change in the initial conditions may produce different values for these measures .",
    "however , the range of the obtained values ensures the existence of chimeras , the nature of which is turbulent .",
    "the system size also has an effect on the calculated values , which saturate for arrays with more that 200 emitters .",
    "a systematic study in the optical frequency detuning and coupling strength parameter space , shows that the region of chimera states lies between full synchronization and desynchronization . for future studies it would be worthwhile to explore the effects introduced by noise as well as the laser pump power which is the most conveniently accessible control parameter in chip scale diode systems .",
