    "<S> we comment on the presence of power - like divergences in kaluza - klein theories with supersymmetry breaking a l scherk - schwarz . by introducing a susy preserving regulator , </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the context of a recently model proposed by barbieri , hall and nomura , the 1-loop higgs mass induced by yukawa interactions is finite and unambiguously defined . </S>",
    "<S> the same result applies to similar models .    </S>",
    "<S> ,    recently there has been a growing interest in extensions of the standard model with extra compact dimensions of tev size in which matter and gauge fields propagate in the bulk @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one key ingredient of these models is the breaking of supersymmetry by a mechanism a l scherk - schwarz @xcite where boundary conditions are responsible for the mismatch between bosonic and fermionic sectors in the low energy spectrum . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> the susy breaking is soft and the radiative corrections to scalar masses are expected to be free from power - like divergences .    in @xcite barbieri , hall and nomura </S>",
    "<S> constructed a realistic model based on a supersymmetric 5d extension of the sm in which the fifth dimension is compactified to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main features is that the higgs mass turns out to be finite and negative at one loop , triggering radiatively ewsb . </S>",
    "<S> notice that even if for any fixed energy the particle spectrum is different for bosons and fermions , the dynamics is still supersymmetric determining the cancellation of power - like divergences . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in order to perform a sensible computation , one has to sum over the entire kk tower @xcite .    in @xcite doubts </S>",
    "<S> has been raised on this picture suggesting that the radiative corrections are finite because of a subtle fine - tuning hidden in the kaluza - klein regularization . </S>",
    "<S> the argument in @xcite makes use of a sharp cutoff both in the kk sum and in the momentum integral and this causes a hard breaking of the supersymmetry .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the result in @xcite by using a pauli - villars ( pv ) regulator which manifestly preserves supersymmetry , showing that there is no uv ambiguity in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also repeated the computation in dimensional regularization which is simpler to implement , obtaining the same result . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our conclusions can be extended to similar models in which supersymmetry is broken a l scherk - schwarz .    </S>",
    "<S> we recall that in @xcite all the standard model fields live in 5d , in particular the matter fields @xmath2 are described by a five dimensional hypermultiplet consisting of two 4d chiral superfields @xmath3 with @xmath4 . as a consequence of the orbifold projections , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 bulk susy reduces at the two fixed points @xmath6 and @xmath7 to two different @xmath8 4d supersymmetries , @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant interaction for the one loop correction to the higgs mass is the top yukawa coupling , localized on the brane sitting in the orbifold fixed point @xmath6 ( identified with @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pv regulator is introduced at the lagrangian level by adding an higher derivative term in the kinetic part @xcite . a term like @xmath12 , or @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the 4d box and @xmath15 , is sufficient to regulate our integrals and preserves n=2 supersymmetry in the bulk .    </S>",
    "<S> the cancellation of divergences between the bosonic and fermionic contribution is most easily exhibited using @xmath13 ; we will show explicitly how the two different choices lead to the same conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we write the pv regularized action in terms of 4d chiral superfields as @xmath16 \\begin{split } s_{kin } = & \\sum_i \\int d^5x \\ , \\big \\ { \\int d^2 \\theta d^2 \\bar{\\theta }   \\ ;     \\bar{\\phi}_i \\left[1 + \\lambda^{-4 } \\box^2 \\right ] \\phi_i    + { \\bar{\\phi}}_i^c \\left[1 + \\lambda^{-4 } \\box^2 \\right ] \\phi_i^c \\\\   & + \\int d^2 \\theta \\ ; \\phi_i^c \\,{\\partial}_5 \\,\\left[1+\\lambda^{-4 }     \\box^2   \\right ]   \\phi_i \\big \\ }   \\end{split } \\label{kin } \\\\ s_{int } = & \\int d^5x \\ </S>",
    "<S> , \\frac{1}{2 } \\left[\\delta(y ) + \\delta(y - \\pi r ) \\right ]      \\int d^2 \\theta \\ ; \\big ( \\lambda_u   \\ , q u h + \\text{h.c . }   </S>",
    "<S> \\big ) \\label{act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this expression it is manifest that the action ( [ stot ] ) is invariant under the 4d @xmath8 supersymmetry still operating at @xmath6 . in terms of the components fields , after a kk decomposition , the yukawa interaction ( [ act ] ) reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote the @xmath19-th mode component fields of @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the zero mode higgs field , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in the presence of the regulator the auxiliary fields @xmath27 propagate and they can not be eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant feynman diagrams contributing to the higgs mass @xmath28 are shown in figure 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the result is @xmath29 ^ 2 } \\times \\\\   & \\quad \\big\\ { \\big [ \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\frac{1}{(x^2+(2k)^2 ) } \\big]^2 -     \\big [ \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\frac{1}{(x^2+(2k+1)^2 ) } \\big]^2 \\big\\ } \\ ; , \\end{split }   \\label{mass}\\ ] ]    we stress that our regulator makes the standing alone contribution from the bosonic ( fermionic ) sector in ( [ mass ] ) convergent for any finite @xmath30 as one can easily verify by simple power counting . because of this , it is clear that exchanging the series with the integral is a legitimate operation , leading in both cases to a convergent result for the single contribution . </S>",
    "<S> resumming the series first is simpler and gives @xmath31 ^ 2 } \\ ,    \\big\\ { \\coth^2\\left[\\frac{\\pi x}{2}\\right ]   - \\tanh^2\\left[\\frac{\\pi x}{2}\\right ] \\big\\ } \\ ; , \\ ] ] the bosonic and fermionic parts both contain a term @xmath32 which exactly cancels in the difference , leaving a finite result . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , locality forces the counterterm to be localized on the boundary and , by simple power counting , it must be proportional to @xmath32 , having the 5d higgs field dimension [ mass]@xmath35 and the yukawa @xmath36 dimension [ mass]@xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the effective field theory restricts the possible forms of the divergences , leaving only the @xmath32 term . summing up the fermionic and bosonic contributions in ( [ both ] ) we obtain @xmath38 which coincides with the result in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> choosing from the beginning the 5d box , instead of the 4d one for the pv regulator in ( [ kin ] ) , leads to the same conclusion , but in this case expressions are more involved . resumming the series first , one obtains @xmath39 \\quad , \\label{ris}\\ ] ] where @xmath40}{x } - \\pi \\ , \\text{re }   \\ ,     \\frac{\\coth\\left[\\pi \\sqrt{x^2+i(\\lambda r)^2}\\right]}{\\sqrt{x^2+i(\\lambda r)^2 } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] again , the single term in ( [ ris ] ) is convergent , but it is more difficult to extract the leading @xmath30 dependence . in the limit in which @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the same result as in ( [ res ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the same computation can be performed using a suitable adapted version of dimensional regularization ( see appendix d of @xcite ) . even if dimensional regularization is not sensitive to power - like divergences , it is useful to check that it reproduces the pv result . after extending the integral and the series to generic dimensions @xmath42 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 , introducing two schwinger parameters @xmath44 , the higgs mass can be written as @xmath45 \\ ; ; \\end{split } \\label{theta}\\ ] ] where the theta functions @xmath46 are defined as @xmath47 from the asymptotic expansion for @xmath46 when @xmath48 it is clear that the integral in ( [ theta ] ) is convergent when @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; we checked numerically that for @xmath51 , @xmath52 the result for @xmath1 coincides with ( [ res ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss the interpretation of our result . </S>",
    "<S> although the model under examination does not possess , after the orbifold projection , any global supersymmetry , it is nevertheless invariant under a local supersymmetry , which , from the 4d point of view , is different at different points along the compactified direction . to obtain meaningful results from a loop calculation , it is therefore necessary to respect such a symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the natural and simplest way to take into account the corresponding constraints is to introduce a ( local ) supersymmetric regulator . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that any sensible regularization must render finite both the sum and the integral and moreover there is no reason to distinguish between them , being on the same footing from a 5d point of a view . </S>",
    "<S> it is here that our interpretation diverges from ref @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> local supersymmetry would not be respected if the sum over the kk modes were cut at a finite value , much in the same way a sharp cut - off would break gauge invariance in qed . </S>",
    "<S> hence the appearance , in such a case , of a power divergence in an operator not consistent with the symmetry itself ; for instance , a local mass counterterm localized in the orbifolds fixed points does not respect the residual @xmath8 supersymmetries @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to stress that uv divergences in field theory , being local , are controlled by local symmetries rather than global ones . to further clarify this point , that has nothing to do with susy but is much more general , consider a scalar field theory in 5d with the fifth dimension compactified to a circle @xmath53 . of course </S>",
    "<S> the global @xmath54 invariance is broken to @xmath55 by the compactification , nevertheless the classical action is invariant under the diffeomorphisms of @xmath56 and only general covariant counterterms like @xmath57 are allowed . for instance a term like @xmath58 which is invariant under @xmath55 is forbidden . in the case of an orbifold compactification the situation is similar with a slight complication due to the presence of boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in this discussion gravity is _ not _ dynamical but simply an external background . </S>",
    "<S> when susy is present , diffeomorphisms are promoted to super diffeomorphisms and the same result applies . </S>",
    "<S> of course if one uses a sharp cut - off this picture is lost . summarizing , </S>",
    "<S> provided that the relevant symmetries are preserved , differently from what claimed in @xcite , we have shown that the higgs mass term induced by localized yukawa couplings on the orbifold fixed points is finite and unambiguously defined .    during the completion of this work </S>",
    "<S> another paper appeared @xcite on the same subject , reaching the same conclusions by means of a thick brane . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> , we notice that our method seems more general , because it is more in the spirit of effective field theory , in which brane thickness can not be resolved , and suitable for a systematic treatment of divergences as in conventional field theory .    * note added * + after this work was completed a new paper appeared @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out that in the specific model considered by barbieri , hall and nomura ( bhn ) there is a uv sensitivity in the higgs mass stemming from a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term which arises at 1-loop . </S>",
    "<S> the fi term signals the presence of a gauge anomaly which could render the bhn model inconsistent . </S>",
    "<S> however , our explicit computation of the 1-loop higgs mass correction involves only the yukawa sector and therefore it is not altered . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we stress that our discussion on the structure of counterterms which result from the choice of a regulator consistent with the underlying symmetries has a general validity , provided that anomalies are absent . </S>"
