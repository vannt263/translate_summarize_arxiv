    "gravitation is a macroscopic phenomenon , governing the behavior of matter at scales from a few cm . up to the largest scales of cosmology , @xmath0 cm . on the other hand quantum phenomena",
    "are associated generally with microscopic distances , on the order of atomic scales , @xmath1 cm . or smaller .",
    "the physical and mathematical frameworks used to describe physics at these disparate scales are quite different as well , and at first sight appear even to be irreconcilable . in general relativity gravitation",
    "is founded on the equivalence principle , which finds its mathematical expression in differential equations which transform covariantly under a local change of frame at every spacetime point . in classical physics",
    "this idealization of spacetime as a local differentiable structure is quite natural . yet because of quantum fluctuations it is very likely that the classical description of spacetime as a smooth pseudo - riemannian manifold fails at very short distance scales , of the order of the planck length , @xmath2 cm .",
    "perhaps less widely appreciated is that quantum theory also raises questions about the purely local , classical description of the gravitational interactions of matter , even at macroscopic distances .",
    "this is because of the peculiarly quantum phenomena of phase coherence and entanglement , which may be present on any scale , given the right conditions .",
    "indeed macroscopic quantum states are encountered in virtually all branches of physics on a very wide variety of scales .",
    "some of the better known examples occur in non - relativistic many - body and condensed matter systems , such as bose - einstein condensation , superfluidity , and superconductivity .",
    "these quantum coherence effects due to the wave - like properties of matter have their close analogs in relativistic field theories as well , in spontaneous symmetry breaking by the higgs mechanism in electroweak theory , and chiral quark pair condensation in low energy qcd . in each of these cases the ground state or",
    " vacuum \" is a macroscopic quantum state , described at very long wavelengths by a non - vanishing quasi - classical order parameter , in a low energy effective field theory .",
    "the strictly classical theory of general relativity would seem to preclude any incorporation of macroscopic coherence and entanglement effects of quantum matter , on any scale .",
    "taking account of the quantum wave - like properties of matter , and its propensity to form phase correlated states over macroscopic distance scales at low enough temperatures and/or high enough densities requires at the least a semi - classical treatment of the effective stress - energy tensor source for einstein s equations . the corresponding one - loop effective action for gravity",
    "can be determined by the methods of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "our principal purpose in this paper is to demonstrate that non - local macroscopic coherence effects are contained in the low energy eft of gravity , provided that einstein s classical theory is _ supplemented _ by the contributions of the one - loop quantum trace anomaly of massless fields .",
    "the low energy eft of gravity is determined by the same general principles as in other contexts @xcite , namely by an expansion in powers of derivatives of local terms consistent with symmetry .",
    "short distance effects are parameterized by the coefficients of local operators in the effective action , with higher order terms suppressed by inverse powers of an ultraviolet cutoff scale @xmath3 .",
    "the effective theory need not be renormalizable , as indeed einstein s theory is not , but is expected nonetheless to be quite insensitive to the details of the underlying microscopic degrees of freedom , because of decoupling @xcite .",
    "it is the decoupling of short distance degrees of freedom from the macroscopic physics that makes eft techniques so widely applicable , and which we assume applies also to gravity .    as a covariant metric theory with a symmetry dictated by the equivalence principle , namely invariance under general coordinate transformations ,",
    "general relativity may be regarded as just such a local eft , truncated at second order in derivatives of the metric field @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "when quantum matter is considered , the stress tensor becomes an operator whose expectation value acts as a source for the einstein equations in the semi - classical limit .",
    "fourth order terms in derivatives of the metric are necessary to absorb divergences in the expectation value of the stress tensor in curved spacetime , but the effects of such higher derivative _ local _ terms in the gravitational effective action are suppressed at distance scales @xmath5 in the low energy eft limit . hence surveying only local curvature terms , it is often tacitly assumed that einstein s theory contains all the low energy macroscopic degrees of freedom of gravity , and that general relativity can not be modified at macroscopic distance scales , much greater than @xmath6 , without violating general coordinate invariance and/or eft principles .",
    "however , this presumption should be re - examined in the presence of quantum anomalies .",
    "when a classical symmetry is broken by a quantum anomaly , the naive decoupling of short and long distance physics assumed by an expansion in local operators with ascending inverse powers of @xmath3 fails . in this situation even the low energy symmetries of the effective theory",
    "are changed by the presence of the anomaly , and some remnant of the ultraviolet physics survives in the low energy description .",
    "an anomaly can have significant effects in the low energy eft because it is not suppressed by any large energy cutoff scale , surviving even in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "any explicit breaking of the symmetry in the classical lagrangian serves only to mask the effects of the anomaly , but in the right circumstances the effects of the non - local anomaly may still dominate the local terms .",
    "a well known example is the chiral anomaly in qcd with massless quarks , whose effects are unsuppressed by any inverse power of the eft ultraviolet cutoff scale @xmath8 .",
    "although the quark masses are non - zero , and chiral symmetry is only approximate in nature , the chiral anomaly gives the dominant contribution to the low energy decay amplitude of @xmath9 in the standard model @xcite , a contribution that is missed entirely by a local eft expansion in pion fields .",
    "instead the existence of the chiral anomaly requires the explicit addition to the local effective action of a _ non - local _ term in four physical dimensions to account for its effects @xcite .",
    "although when an anomaly is present , naive decoupling between the short and long distance degrees of freedom fails , it does so in a well - defined way , with a coefficient that depends only on the quantum numbers of the underlying microscopic theory .",
    "in fact , since the chiral anomaly depends on the color charge assignments of the short distance quark degrees of freedom , the measured low energy decay width of @xmath9 affords a clean , non - trivial test of the underlying microscopic quantum theory of qcd with three colors of fractionally charged quarks @xcite .",
    "the bridge between short and long distance physics which anomalies provide is the basis for the anomaly matching conditions @xcite .    in curved space",
    "an anomaly closely related to the chiral anomaly also appears in massless quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "this conformal or trace anomaly provides us with additional infrared relevant terms that do not decouple in the limit @xmath10 , and which should be added to the einstein - hilbert action of classical relativity , to complete the eft of low energy gravity .    that the trace anomaly terms are necessary for the low energy completion of the eft of gravity may be seen from the classification of possible terms in the gravitational effective action according to their behavior under global weyl rescalings @xcite .",
    "the terms in the classical einstein - hilbert action scale with positive powers ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) under rescaling of distance , and are clearly relevant operators of the low energy description .",
    "the non - local anomalous terms scale logarithmically ( @xmath13 ) with distance under weyl rescalings , and therefore should be considered _",
    "marginally relevant_. unlike local higher derivative terms in the effective action , which are either neutral or scale with negative powers of @xmath14 under global weyl rescalings of the metric , the anomalous terms can not be discarded in the low energy , large distance limit .",
    "the addition of the anomaly term(s ) to the low energy effective action of gravity amounts to a non - trivial infrared modification of general relativity , fully consistent with both quantum theory and the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "the anomalous terms in the effective action lead to corresponding additional terms in the stress tensor and equations of motion of the low energy eft of gravity .",
    "these terms are most conveniently expressed in terms of two auxiliary scalar fields which permit the non - local effective action of the trace anomaly and its variations to be cast into local form .",
    "the additional scalar degrees of freedom in these terms take account of macroscopic effects of quantum matter in gravitational fields , which are not contained in the purely classical , local metric description of einstein s theory .    in this paper",
    "we give explicit formulae for the stress tensor due to the trace anomaly of massless fields to be added to the classical einstein equations in the low energy eft limit , and expose its macroscopic effects in a number of familiar geometries .",
    "the most interesting effects are associated with geometries that have horizons , boundaries , or non - trivial global topologies .",
    "for example , the two new auxiliary fields in the effective action generically diverge as the apparent horizon of rindler , schwarzschild , and de sitter spacetimes is approached .",
    "this behavior of the scalar auxiliary fields gives a coordinate invariant semi - classical order parameter description of possible divergences of stress tensors of quantum field theories on spacetime horizons , enabling an understanding of such divergences in terms of the global properties of the geometry .",
    "the casimir energy density between two conducting plates is an example of a bounded space without horizons or curvature which also admits a simple description in terms of the scalar auxiliary fields .",
    "the various examples taken together suggest that the degrees of freedom contained in the scalar potentials induced by the trace anomaly should be regarded as semi - classical macroscopic order parameter fields ( condensates ) , whose non - vanishing values are connected with non - trivial boundary conditions , horizons , or the topology of spacetime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the auxiliary field form of the effective action of the trace anomaly in two dimensions , recovering results for the stress tensor of conformal fields in the two dimensional rindler wedge , schwarzschild and de sitter metrics . in section iii",
    "we discuss the general form of the effective action in four dimensions , and give the additional terms in the stress tensor in terms of the auxiliary fields , as well as the conserved noether current associated with it . in section iv we consider the effects of these additional terms and the new local scalar degrees of freedom of low energy gravity they represent in flat , rindler and the conformally flat de sitter spacetime . in section",
    "v we discuss the approximate conformal symmetry which pertains in the vicinity of any static , spherically symmetric killing horizon and give the explicit form of the auxiliary fields in the schwarzschild case .",
    "we characterize the possible singularities of the stress tensor on the schwarzschild horizon , and find approximate stress tensors for the hartle - hawking , boulware , and unruh states , comparing our results with numerical results for @xmath15 of massless fields of various spins .",
    "we conclude in section vi with a summary of our results and their implications for quantum effects in gravity . the appendix contains the explicit formulae for the components of the stress - energy in static spherically symmetric spacetimes , upon which the schwarzschild and de sitter results are based .",
    "the effective action for the trace anomaly in any even dimension is non - local when expressed in terms only of the metric @xmath16 .",
    "it can be made local by the introduction of scalar auxiliary field(s ) . to illustrate this procedure and introduce the general framework which we will use extensively in four dimensions , we consider first the somewhat simpler case of two physical dimensions . in @xmath17",
    "the trace anomaly takes the simple form @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of massless fields , either scalar ( @xmath20 ) or fermionic ( @xmath21 ) . the fact that the anomalous trace is independent of the quantum state of the matter field(s ) , and dependent only on the geometry through the local ricci scalar @xmath22 suggests that it should be regarded as a geometric effect .",
    "however , no local coordinate invariant action exists whose metric variation leads to ( [ trtwo ] ) .    a non - local action corresponding to ( [ trtwo ] ) can be found by introducing the conformal parameterization of the metric , @xmath23 and noticing that the scalar curvature densities of the two metrics @xmath16 and @xmath24 are related by @xmath25 a linear relation in @xmath26 in two ( and only two ) dimensions . multiplying ( [ trtwo ] ) by @xmath27 , using ( [ rrbar ] ) and noting that @xmath28 defines the conformal variation , @xmath29 of an effective action @xmath30",

    "it is the freedom to specify boundary conditions for the classical auxiliary field @xmath48 , or equivalently add homogeneous solutions to the non - local green s function @xmath46 which implies the possibility of global macroscopic effects of the anomaly .",

    "for that reason we do not need an additional integration constant for either of the fourth order differential equations ( [ auxeom ] ) .    with the general spherically symmetric solution for @xmath449 and @xmath452",
    ", we can proceed to compute the stress - energy tensor in a stationary , spherically symmetric quantum state .",
    "for example the boulware state may be characterized as that state which approaches the flat space vacuum as rapidly as possible as @xmath161 @xcite . in the flat space limit",
    "this means that the allowed @xmath453 and @xmath397 behavior in the auxiliary fields ( @xmath397 and constant behavior in their first derivatives ) must be set to zero .",
    "inspection of the asymptotic form ( [ schlimb ] ) shows that this is achieved by requiring    @xmath454    if we set @xmath413 as well , in order to have a static anasatz for the boulware state , then the remaining two constants @xmath400 and @xmath404 are free parameters of the auxiliary fields , and lead to a stress - energy which generically has the divergent behaviors , @xmath455 on the horizon .",

    "the linear time dependence ( [ tsch ] ) is consistent with the singular behaviors ( [ sings ] ) of the stress - energy on the horizon .",
    "since the stress - energy in the boulware state diverges as @xmath456 in any case , we can match this leading divergence in the anomalous stress tensor by adjusting @xmath400 and @xmath404 appropriately .",
    "one then has a one parameter fit to the numerical data of @xcite .",

    "for comparison purposes , we have plotted also the analytic approximation of page , brown , and ottewill @xcite ( dashed curves in figs . 1 ) .",
    "we observe that the two parameter fit with the anomalous stress tensor in terms of the auxiliary @xmath48 and @xmath278 fields is more accurate than the approximation of refs .",
    "@xcite for the boulware state . in the latter case",
    "the stress - tensor is approximated by making a special conformal transformation @xmath459 to the optical metric , obtained from the schwarzschild line element ( [ sfour ] ) by dividing by @xmath460 .",
    "this procedure was also motivated by the form of the trace anomaly , in that for ultrastatic metrics with the timelike killing field @xmath211 , the optical metric conformally related it has vanishing trace anomaly @xcite . however , unlike the general form of the anomalous stress tensor in ( [ tanom ] ) , which involves solving linear equations for two independent auxiliary fields , the approximation of refs . @xcite is applicable only to special cases , such as schwarzschild geometry which are both ultrastatic and ricci flat , and admit a particular conformal transformation to the static optical metric . in contrast",
    "the approach based on the auxiliary field anomalous effective action does not require any special properties of the background spacetime , and because of the near horizon conformal symmetry gives the general form of the divergences of the stress - energy on horizon .",
    "an important practical difference between these approximations and that considered here is that they yield simple algebraic approximations to the stress - energy , whereas ( [ tanom ] ) generally contains logarithmic terms as well .",
    "evidently the general form of the effective stress - energy tensor due to the anomaly in terms of two auxiliary fields and the freedom to add homogeneous solutions to the linear eqs .",
    "( [ auxeom ] ) allows for a better approximation to the exact stress tensor in the boulware state than that of refs.@xcite near the schwarzschild horizon .",
    "the stress - energy diverges on the horizon in an entire family of states for generic values of the eight auxiliary field parameters @xmath461 , in addition to the boulware state . hence in the general allowed parameter space of spherically",
    "symmetric macroscopic states , horizon divergences of the stress - energy are quite generic , and not resticted to the boulware state . on the other hand , the condition ( [ fint ] ) that the stress - energy om the horizon be finite gives four conditions on these eight parameters , in order to cancel the four possible divergences listed in ( [ sings ] ) . referring to the explicit form of the stress - energy components in static spherically symmetric spacetimes given in the appendix",
    ", these four conditions can be satisfied in several different ways . the simplest possibility with the minimal number of conditions on the auxiliary field parameters is via    @xmath462    [ fincond ]    -1 cm it is noteworthy that this cancellation requires a non - zero topological charge @xmath463 , much as in the two dimensional schwarzschild case , and again unlike the fulling - rindler case in either two or four dimensions .",
    "the @xmath463 condition may be understood from the fact that it cancels the logarithmic divergence of @xmath464 in the second form of ( [ phips ] ) , leaving however a logarithmic singularity and non - trivial topological charge at both the origin and infinity .    also noteworthy",
    "is that the the auxiliary field configurations which lead to diverging stress tensors on the horizon have _ finite action _ ( [ allanom ] ) .",
    "this is clear from the fact that @xmath465 hence both @xmath466 and @xmath467 are proportional to @xmath468 , which is integrable with respect to the measure @xmath469 as @xmath430 , and the integrals in ( [ sef ] ) converge at the horizon for the general solution ( [ tsch ] ) of the auxiliary field equations .",
    "this is not the case at infinity , unless the four constants @xmath470 and @xmath447 are all required to vanish . from ( [ phips ] ) in this case",
    "the auxiliary fields fall off at large distances @xmath471 similarly to the scalar potential of newtonian gravity , or brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "because of the very different way they couple to spacetime curvature , the auxiliary fields of @xmath67 give only a very weak long - range interaction between massive bodies , that falls off very rapidly with distance ( at least as fast as @xmath472 ) .",
    "thus from consideration of the general form of the anomalous action and auxiliary fields in the vicinity of the schwarzschild horizon and their falloff at infinity , we find no _ a priori _ justification for excluding generic states with stress - energy tensors that grow without bound as the horizon is approached . in such states",
    "the backreaction of the stress - energy on the geometry will be substantial in this region and lead to qualitatively new macroscopic effects on the horizon scale .    if instead of requiring rapid falloff at infinity we require regularity of the stress - energy on the horizon ,",
    "_ i.e. _ conditions ( [ fincond ] ) , which is a four parameter restriction of the eight parameters in the auxiliary fields of the form ( [ phips ] ) and ( [ tsch ] ) .",
    "these are the conditions appropriate to the hartle - hawking - israel and unruh states @xcite . because of the linear time dependence ( [ tsch ] ) we also obtain a no - zero flux @xmath473 in general . for the hartle - hawking state",
    "the vanishing of this flux gives a fifth condition , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath474 on the parameters of the auxiliary fields . of the remaining three parameters",

    "alternately , the conformal transformation ( [ consch ] ) could be used to fix the leading order behavior of the auxiliary field @xmath48 near the horizon , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath476 . then ( [ flux ] ) fixes @xmath409 which with @xmath477 becomes redundant with the first of the conditions ( [ fincond ] ) . hence only @xmath434 and @xmath478",

    "@xcite in an accurate analytic polynomial fit to their data provided by the same authors .",
    "we note that the energy density in the hartle - hawking state computed from the general form of the anomaly is not in especially good agreement with the direct numerical calculations from the underlying quantum field theory .",
    "this is in accordance with the general discussion of the exact and low energy effective actions of the previous section . in states which have no divergences on the horizon",
    "there is no particular reason to neglect the weyl invariant terms @xmath274 in the exact effective action , and the stress - energy tensor it produces would be expected to be comparable in magnitude to that from @xmath67 , and both contributions are negligibly small on macroscopic scales .",
    "however in states such as the previous boulware example , the diverging behavior of the stress tensor near the horizon is captured accurately by the terms in ( [ tanom ] ) arising from the anomaly , which have the same generically diverging behaviors as the quantum field theory expectation value @xmath15 . even in states for which the expectation value remains regular on the horizon , the auxiliary field anomalous stress - energy",
    "can be matched accurately to the finite value of @xmath15 on the horizon with suitable choice of integration constants in ( [ phips ] ) .",
    "for comparison plotted also in figs .",
    "2a and 2b is the analytic approximation to @xmath475 of frolov and zelnikov ( fz ) @xcite .",
    "this latter approximation gives an improvement over that of @xcite since it permits adjustment of the value of the stress - energy on the horizon to the numerical data , rather than fixing it to an incorrect value .",
    "once that is done , the fz approximation automatically gives the correct asymptotic value of the stress - energy in the hartle - hawking state at infinity , but contains no additional free parameters .",
    "for the spin @xmath479 case the fz approximation is a significant improvement of that of pbo which disagrees with the numerics even in the sign of @xmath475 on the horizon . although it is a noticeably better fit to the numerical data than ( [ tanom ] ) , the fz approximation , like that of pbo , relies on the existence of a timelike killing field and both are therefore highly specialized to certain spacetime backgrounds such as the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "in contrast the stress - energy tensor ( [ tanom ] ) arising from @xmath67 in the low energy eft does not require the existence of a timelike killing field , and can be computed in principle for arbitrary spacetimes .",
    "for the time asymmetric unruh state the zero flux condition ( [ flux ] ) is replaced by the properly normalized finite flux condition , @xmath482 where the luminosity , @xmath14 is given by @xmath483 in terms of the auxiliary field parameters .",
    "otherwise one can proceed as in the previous hawking - hartle state by fixing two of the three remaining auxiliary field parameters by the values of @xmath475 on the future horizon and at infinity which are known numerically for the scalar and electromagnetic fields in the unruh state from the work of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this leaves again one parameter free to fit .",
    "the results of that fit for the conformally coupled scalar and electromagnetic fields in the unruh state are shown in figs .",

    "the dashed curves are accurate polynomial fits of @xcite and @xcite to the numerical data of @xcite and @xcite for the spin @xmath480 and @xmath481 fields respectively .",
    "there is at present no numerical calculation of the stress - energy tensor of the massless dirac field in the unruh state with which to compare .",
    "the foregoing analysis of the anomalous action and stress tensor in the schwarzschild background may be extended to other spacetimes with metrics of the form ( [ sfour ] ) .",
    "the electrically charged reisner - nordstrom black hole for which @xmath484 is an example in which eqs .",
    "( [ fexp])-([rovf ] ) may also be applied .",
    "the extreme reisner - nordstrom geometry in which @xmath485 is particularly interesting . in that case",
    "the two zeroes of @xmath414 at @xmath486 coincide and @xmath487 vanishes quadratically .",
    "the possible singularities of the stress - energy on the extreme reissner - nordstrom horizon are correspondingly more severe , behaving like @xmath488 .",
    "nevertheless a power series expansion near @xmath489 shows that it is possible to obtain a regular stress - energy on the horizon with ( [ tanom ] ) even in the extreme reisner - nordstrom case with appropriate choice of auxiliary field integration constants , in agreement with the direct numerical results of @xcite .",
    "thus the anomaly induced effective action can reproduce the correct behaviors of the quantum stress tensor also in this case , in contrast to the approximation of @xcite which predicts a divergent stress - energy on the horizon of an extreme reisner - nordstrom black hole as the only possibility , as it is not possible to solve the auxiliary field equations analytically in the black hole geometries when @xmath490 , and a numerical solution is required , we postpone a full discussion of these results to a future publication @xcite .",
    "finally , this study the anomalous effective action , auxiliary fields , and stress - energy could be extended to rotating kerr black hole geometries .",
    "the previous analytical approximations of @xcite do not apply to this case .",
    "however there is no problem of principle in computing the stress tensor ( [ tanom ] ) in stationary spacetimes possessing only axial symmetry . because of the lower symmetry",
    ", solutions of the auxiliary field equations ( [ auxeom ] ) which are functions of both @xmath397 and @xmath126 can be sought .",

    "is expected as that found in the schwarzschild case , which clearly merits a separate investigation .",

    "we have extended the eft framework from the weak field expansion around flat space considered in @xcite to arbitrary curved spacetimes , provided only that the curvature invariants are small compared to the planck scale .",
    "the eft expansion in inverse powers of the high energy cutoff scale of order @xmath223 requires a systematic classification of relevant and irrelevant operators in the general coordinate invariant effective action . according to this classification , based on the behavior under global weyl rescalings @xcite ,",
    "the classical einstein - hilbert action should be supplemented with certain well - defined non - local terms associated with the trace anomaly of massless fields .",
    "these additional terms are non - local in terms of the metric , _ cf . _",
    "( [ nonl ] ) but nevertheless because they scale logarithmically with distance are relevant in the infrared .",
    "the anomalous terms are unsuppressed by any inverse power of the ultraviolet cutoff scale @xmath223 , and do not decouple for @xmath270 .",
    "hence they are required in the wilson effective action ( [ seff ] ) for gravitational physics at macroscopic distances @xmath5 .",
    "this constitutes an non - trivial infrared modification of einstein s theory which is completely consistent with the equivalence principle .",
    "the local form of the anomaly introduces two scalar auxiliary fields , @xmath48 and @xmath278 , into the eft for low energy gravity , one for each of the non - trivial co - cycles of the weyl group .",
    "these scalar fields satisfy the fourth order massless wave equations ( [ auxeom ] ) , and are only very weakly coupled to ordinary matter and radiation . in the flat space limit",
    "they decouple entirely .",
    "the auxiliary fields are new local scalar degrees of freedom of the gravitational field , not contained in classical general relativity .",
    "the anomalous terms in the effective action also generate two new conserved tensors ( [ eab ] ) and ( [ fab ] ) , local in the auxiliary fields , which contribute to the stress - energy tensor of low energy gravity ( [ tanom ] ) , as a source for einstein s equations in vacuo .",
    "since they arise from the long range effects of the fluctuations of massless fields , and require boundary conditions for their complete specification , these additional terms carry information about the global macroscopic effects of quantum matter . in the approximation where the auxiliary scalar fields are treated as classical potentials",
    ", they may be viewed as macroscopic order parameter fields of low energy gravity .",
    "because of the conformal properties of spacetime horizons , the anomalous terms in the effective action and stress - energy become important in their vicinity , characterizing the allowed behaviors of the stress tensor there .",
    "near an horizon the most important terms in the effective action ( [ seff ] ) are those which scale positively in the _ ultraviolet _ short distance limit under conformal rescalings , while nevertheless keeping local curvature invariants fixed and small compared to the planck scale . only the @xmath67 term in ( [ seff ] ) has this property , scaling logarithmically in both the ultraviolet and infrared limits . because the anomalous terms depend non - locally on the geometry through the two auxiliary scalar fields @xmath48 and @xmath278 , they can be significant near horizons even for very much sub - planckian local curvatures , where the eft description should continue to apply . indeed",
    "although local curvature invariants remain small on horizons , the auxiliary scalar fields depend in general on coordinate invariant global quantities such as @xmath210 which diverge on the horizon when the spacetime possesses a timelike killing field @xmath211 which becomes null there . whether or not this divergence actually occurs in the stress - energy of a given state is a matter of boundary conditions fixed globally over the entire spacetime .",
    "the existence of a topological current and associated noether charge are characteristic of these global effects of the quantum state .",
    "the generic singular behavior of the stress - energy on horizons is thereby characterized in terms of spacetime invariant scalar order parameters in the low energy eft , which is completely consistent with general coordinate invariance .    in the ( semi-)classical eft framework where both the metric and auxiliary scalars are treated as classical fields , eqs .",
    "( [ auxeom ] ) may be solved classically and provide a new method to calculate the approximate quantum stress tensor of conformal matter by classical means , bypassing the standard but cumbersome procedure of field quantization and renormalization of the quantum stress tensor .",
    "when states for which the stress - energy does not diverge on the horizon are considered , approximations such as those in @xcite , developed specifically for static backgrounds with a timelike killing field yield a more accurate approximation to the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "we conclude that in states with a finite stress - energy on the horizon the low energy wilson effective action ( [ seff ] ) is not a particularly good approximation to the exact quantum effective action ( [ sexact ] ) , as indeed there is no reason why it should be in such states where quantum effects are negligibly small in any case .    on the other hand when the scalar potentials diverge on the horizon , the associated terms in the stress - energy yield a good approximation to the vacuum expectation value of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "compared to previous analytic approximations ( [ tanom ] ) with ( [ auxeom ] ) has the considerable advantage of being completely general , and giving all possible allowed singular behaviors of the stress tensor on horizons . in this case the auxiliary scalar potentials may be viewed as horizon order parameters .",
    "even when the stress - energies diverge , they are characterized by auxiliary fields with finite action , suggesting that such states should not be excluded _ a priori _ from physical consideration .",
    "we conclude that the effective action and stress - energy of the anomaly provides a consistent infrared modification of general relativity that incorporates long - range macroscopic quantum coherence and entanglement effects in a natural way .",
    "this low energy modification is actually required on general eft grounds .",
    "the auxiliary fields of the anomalous action and stress - energy may be viewed as macroscopic condensates .",
    "the study of their effective stress - energy tensor in several special fixed spacetime backgrounds presented here clearly only begins a systematic treatment of their many possible other effects .",
    "in addition to extension to other backgrounds , particularly those with horizons , and a study of the scalar gravitational waves and long range effects these scalar potentials may generate , a rich variety of new solutions are to be expected when the @xmath495 of eqs .",
    "( [ tanom ] ) is used as fully dynamical sources for einstein s equations . whether these effects can be used to test the theory against astrophysical observations is a most important issue for further investigation . in the case of divergent behavior of the stress - energy near the classical horizon a significant deviation of the geometry from the vacuum solutions of the purely classical einstein equations",
