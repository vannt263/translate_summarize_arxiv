    "the standard model ( sm ) is very succesful , but is not yet a complete theory .",
    "there are several fundamental questions , which require physics beyond the sm for a solution . among them",
    "are e.g. the hierarchy problem , the origin of the charge quantisation and the dark matter composition .",
    "although the new physics is expected typically at high energies , some models predict phenomena at low energies that might be observed in rare decays of the positronium , e.g. into a photon and an axion , a new particle introduced for the solution of the strong cp problem , for a review see@xcite .",
    "positronium , the positron - electron bound state , is the lightest known atom , which is bound and self - annihilates through the same , electromagnetic interaction . at the current level of experimental and theoretical precision",
    "this is the only interaction present in this system , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this feature has made positronium an ideal system for testing the accuracy of the qed calculations for bound states , in particular for the triplet ( @xmath1 ) state of @xmath2 , orthopositronium ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "due to the odd - parity under c - transformation @xmath3 decays predominantly into three photons .",
    "as compared to the singlet ( @xmath4 ) state ( parapositronium ) , the long lifetime of @xmath3 decay , ( due to the phase - space and additional @xmath5 suppression factors ) gives an enhancement factor @xmath6 , in the sensitivity to an admixture of new interactions , which are not accommodated in the sm .",
    "this paper is focused on the search for @xmath7 decay , i.e. a process which is not accompanied by energy deposition in a detector . within the sm orthopositronium",
    "can decay invisibly into a neutrino - antineutrino pair .",
    "the @xmath8 decay occurs through @xmath9 exchange in the @xmath10channel and @xmath11 annihilation via @xmath12 .",
    "the decay width is @xcite @xmath13 for other neutrino flavours only the @xmath12-diagram contributes .",
    "for @xmath14 the decay width is @xcite @xmath15 thus , in the sm the @xmath16 decay rate is very small and evidence for invisible decays would unambiguously signal the presence of new physics . it may be worthwhile to remember that the process with analogous experimental signature , @xmath17 decay plays a fundamental role in the determination of the number of lepton families .",
    "the new models that are relevant to the @xmath18 decay mode predict the existence either of i ) extra - dimensions @xcite , or ii ) fractionally charged particles@xcite , or iii ) a new light vector gauge boson@xcite , or iv ) dark matter of the mirror matter type@xcite . to test these models ,",
    "the required sensitivity in the branching ratio @xmath19 has to be at least as low as @xmath0 .",
    "note however that the search for the mirror matter requires in addition the experiment to be performed in vacuum ( for more details see @xcite ) . such an experiment is discussed and proposed in @xcite .    the first experiment to search for invisible decay channels of o  ps",
    "was performed a long time ago @xcite .",
    "the best present limit for the branching ratio , set in 1992 by mitsui et al.@xcite is @xmath20    the paper is organized as follows . in the next sections",
    "the physics of items i)iii ) is briefly discussed .",
    "the experiment , its setup components and the expected sensitivity are discussed in sections 2 , 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "section 5 contains concluding remarks .",
    "models with infinite additional dimensions of the randall - sundrum type ( brane - world models ) with a big compactification radius @xcite@xmath21@xcite could provide the natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "recently dubovskj , rubakov and tinyakov @xcite pointed out that in r  s brane world models with localized bosons , massive gauge bosons localized to the plank brane are always unstable .",
    "the reason is that bulk modes can have arbitrarily small masses .",
    "any massive mode localized to the brane is then kinematically allowed to decay into these modes .",
    "+ in a recent paper @xcite this mechanism was applied to calculate the decay of o  ps into invisible bulk modes and obtained @xmath22 for a solution of the gauge hierarchy problem the parameter @xmath23 is expected to be @xmath24 .",
    "indirect measurements at lep of the @xmath25 decay width constrain the parameter to @xmath26 . using",
    "this bound one can find @xmath27    the direct lep measurements of @xmath25 results in a less stringent limit @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 these estimates show that the region of @xmath29 for the branching ratio is of great interest for the observation of extra  dimensions .      in 1986",
    "holdom @xcite showed that grand unified models can be constructed in a natural way , adding a second , unobserved , photon to the interaction lagrangian . in this type of model particles with an electric charge very small",
    "compared to the electron , are predicted .",
    "if such milli - charged particles exist with a small mass , the @xmath3 could decay apparently invisibly , since the particles would most likely penetrate any type of calorimeter without interaction .",
    "the corresponding decay width is @xcite    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the electric charge of the @xmath32-particle @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 for spin @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 for a spin - less @xmath32-particle .",
    "for spin @xmath36 millicharged @xmath32-particles and @xmath39 one can find from the experimental bound ( 3 ) that @xmath40 @xcite.a search for millicharged particles through the @xmath41 decay with the sensitivity of @xmath42 would touch the parameter space which is not excluded by results of the recent direct experiment at slac @xcite .      a light vector @xmath32-boson with the interaction lagrangian @xmath43    will also lead to invisible decays of @xmath3.-boson related to the muon @xmath44 and so - called nutev anomalies see , respectively @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "] supposing that the @xmath32-boson interacts with other particles ( fermions ) or ( as a consequence of the higgs mechanism ) with itself and a scalar the contribution of the @xmath32-boson to the electron anomalous magnetic moment is given by the well known formula @xmath45 for @xmath39 from the bound arising from the determination of the fine structure constant with the quantum hall effect ( qhe)@xcite , one can find that @xmath46 .",
    "for the case of the heavy @xmath32-boson ( @xmath47 ) the bound on the anomalous electron magnetic moment leads to the bound @xmath48 for the reaction @xmath49 ( here @xmath50 is a virtual @xmath32-boson and @xmath51 is a fermion ( sterile neutrino ) or a scalar particle ) one finds that @xmath52 where @xmath53 has been defined before and @xmath54 .",
    "from the bound of the qhe we find for @xmath39 that @xmath55 to have an experimentally interesting branching ratio of the order @xmath56 , setting @xmath57 we must have @xmath58 .    in the opposite limit @xmath47 the corresponding bound reads @xmath59 for an @xmath32-boson mass close to the orthopositronium mass , we have the enhancement factor @xmath60 in formula ( 11 ) for the branching ratio , and hence , the coupling constant @xmath61 could be smaller .",
    "in this section the design of the experiment to search for @xmath41 with a sensitivity better than @xmath0 is presented .",
    "the main components of the detector ( shown in figs",
    ". 1 , 2 ) are : the positron source ( @xmath62na ) , the positron tagging system , composed of a scintillating fiber viewed by two photomultipliers ( pm ) , the positronium formation @xmath63 target and a hermetic @xmath64detector .",
    "the coincidence of the pm signals ( see fig.[front ] ) from the positrons crossing the fiber , opens the gate for the data acquisition ( daq ) . in the off  line analysis the 1.27 mev photon , which is emitted from the source simultaneously with the positron ,",
    "is required to be in the trigger bgo counter ( shown in fig.[side ] ) resulting in a high confidence level of positron appearence in the positronium formation region .",
    "a positron , which enters the @xmath63 target may capture an electron creating positronium .",
    "the calorimeter detects , either the direct @xmath65 annihilation in flight or the 2(3 ) photons from the para ( ortho)positronium decays in the target .",
    "the occurrence of the @xmath41 decay would appear as an excess of events with zero  energy deposition in the calorimeter above those expected from the monte carlo prediction ( see section 4 ) or from the direct background measurement .",
    "this measurement presents a new feature of this type of experiment .",
    "the idea is to obtain a pure o ",
    "ps decay energy spectrum by comparing two different spectra from the same target filled either with @xmath66 ( low o ps quenching ) or with air , where the presence of paramagnetic @xmath67 will quench the fraction of o  ps in the target from 10@xmath68 down to 3@xmath68 , due to the spin exchange mechanism@xcite : @xmath69 thus the subtraction of these properly normalized spectra will result in a pure o  ps annihilation energy spectrum in the @xmath64detector .",
    "in addition , compared to the previous experiments@xcite , the region around the target has been designed with as little dead material as possible in order to reduce the photon absorption .",
    "the confidence level for tagging the positron appearance in the target and the efficiency of annihilation photon detection have been improved .",
    "[ front ]    [ side ]      the radioactive isotope @xmath62na , which has a half  life of 2.6 years , was chosen as a source of positrons . the positron emission from the source",
    "is accompanied by the prompt emission of a 1.27 mev photon ( @xmath70 3 ps delay ) ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "this signature provides an inefficiency for positron tagging less than @xmath71 .",
    "the source activity was selected based on a compromise between required trigger rate and a decrease in the signal efficiency due to the overlap of events close in time ( pile up effect ) .",
    "the optimal source activity has been determinated to be about 50 kbq , for which , according to the simulation , the signal efficiency drops down to @xmath72 ( the signal of @xmath41 is defined as an event depositing less than 50 kev in the @xmath64detector ) . in @xmath73 of the cases",
    "the 1.27 mev photon from the source is emitted due to the electron capture ( ec ) , without positron emission .",
    "as discussed in the next section , this process introduces background related to the source container material , which was eliminated by depositing the radioactive isotope directly on the scintillating fiber .",
    "a comparison between @xmath62na and other @xmath74 radioactive isotopes with a sufficiently long lifetime has been made to combine the required confidence level for positron tagging with the minimal amount of dead target material and a high stopping efficiency of positrons in the target .",
    "taking all these considerations into account , we conclude that the @xmath62na is the best compromise for our measurements .",
    "[ 22na ]      the tagging system for the experiment was designed in order to have a confidence level for the positron appearance better than @xmath75 .",
    "it is composed of a thin scintillating fiber viewed by two pm s .",
    "it provides a relatively high efficiency and a small amount of dead material .      for a good positron tagging efficiency ,",
    "the attenuation length and the light yield of the fiber are crucial parameters . after testing the response of different scintillating fibers ,",
    "the bicron bfc 12 with a diameter of 0.5 mm has been selected .",
    "they have been prefered over the 1 mm fibers used in the experiment@xcite because they have less material and the possibility to have a more hermetic calorimeter , due to the smaller gaps between the crystals , through which the fiber has to penetrate to transport the signal outside the calorimeter volume .",
    "similar to experiment@xcite the fiber is squeezed in the middle to get a thickness of about 100 @xmath76 m .",
    "the @xmath62na source is deposited in the middle of the squeezed region .",
    "the measured efficiency for positron detection is slightly less than 50@xmath68 .",
    "the pm s xp 2020 have been chosen for their low noise and for their spectral sensitivity , that fits the emission spectrum of the fiber .",
    "the use of two pm signals in coincidence decreases the probability of accidental coincidences with the 1.27 mev photon to a level of @xmath77 ( see section 3 ) . in the future we plan to test hamamatsu h3165 - 11 pm s with base r647 , because of their high efficiency for single photon counting .",
    "a @xmath63 aerogel hemisphere with a radius of 5 mm and a density of 0.1 @xmath78 , where positronium can be formed with about 5@xmath68 probability ( as measured directly from the lifetime spectrum ) , is used as a target .",
    "the aerogel is a porous material , where the o  ps migrating in the intergranular space can decay almost freely .",
    "the dimension has been optimised to minimize the dead material , while keeping , enough material to stop positrons efficiently .",
    "the simulation shows that the probability that more than 900 kev photons energy is absorbed in it , for the given dimension , is less than @xmath79 . before its installation",
    "the aerogel is evacuated in a vacuum chamber ( 10@xmath80 torr ) and backed out for 2 hours to remove the water from the pores . then the target is filled either with high purity nitrogen or with air .",
    "the optimal choice of the @xmath64detector ( ecal ) can be made by the following considerations .",
    "the total ecal mass w is given roughly by @xmath81    where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are respectively mass density and the radius of the ecal detector .",
    "we chose @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the attenuation length of 511 kev @xmath64 s .",
    "the relevant parameters for different types of materials used in ecal s are listed below in table 1 .",
    ".comparison between different types of ecal [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as mentioned before , the trigger is given by the coincidence between the signals from the two pm of the fiber .",
    "off  line , the 1.27 mev photon is selected in the trigger counter inside the energy window 11701470 kev ( see fig . 5 ) . in order to reduce the accidental background ( see previous section ) the time between the coincidence and the 1.27 mev @xmath64 is required to be inside the time window as shown in fig .",
    "a cut on the energy of the pm is applied to reduce the accidental noise .",
    "the distance between the source and the trigger bgo has been choosen to be 2 cm as a compromise between the trigger rate and the background from the compton ec photon .",
    "the expected trigger rate for a source intensity of 50 kbq is @xmath86 and knowing the fraction of o  ps in the spectra , which is about @xmath87 @xmath88 using poisson statistics and assuming no background event observed , one can calculate the sensitivity of the experiment@xcite after 60 days of running : @xmath89    [ cuts ]",
    "with the presented type of calorimeter a background free limit for the @xmath19 of @xmath90 is reacheable in about two months of data taking .",
    "although not all the possible background sources have been identified yet , the dominant background seems to be associated with the ec photon that scatters in the fiber back to the trigger bgo counter .",
    "the accompanying compton electron can deposit @xmath70 50100 kev in the fiber , which is sufficient to trigger the coincidence of the pm s . since the energy deposition in the trigger counter is almost equal to the total initial energy of the 1.27 mev photon",
    ", it is quite difficult to reject this type of events with the given resolution of the crystal .",
    "one possible way to discriminate these @xmath91 pairs is to use a thin plastic scintillator in front of the trigger bgo , with a faster timing response than the one of the bgo s .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "this experiment was mainly possible due to the availability of the crystals , which were lent to us by psi , villigen .",
    "we are in debt to jacques wolf of the cern radioactivity department for the source deposition on the fiber .",
