    "the revolutionary impact of `` big data '' in biology has been tremendous , transforming it into data - rich field .",
    "the majority of the new data , including data sets of protein structures , dna sequences , and gene expressions are complex , calling for the development of new analytical tools and algorithms to translate the data into valuable insights .",
    "the first challenge then lies in the efficient representation of biological data objects .",
    "graphs have shown promising potential in representing data objects including dna @xcite and small molecules @xcite due to their high abstractional capacity @xcite .",
    "the problem of biological data analysis is then reduced to graph analysis .",
    "the goal is to search , visualize , and infer new correlations among objects to produce healthier foods , prevent diseases , and discover individually customized drugs .",
    "therefore , meaningful metrics are required to determine similarity and dissimilarity among graphs .",
    "graph similarity methods are developed primarily based on the property of isomorphism in the graph theory literature @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath1 is called isomorphic to a graph @xmath2 if there is a bijection between the vertex sets @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that there exists a mapping between the adjacent pairs of vertices of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is an ",
    "edge - preserving \" bijection , consistent with the general notion of  structure - preserving \" .",
    "the main drawback of isomorphism in comparing real objects is its restrictive binary nature  it does not consider partial similarities among graphs .",
    "two graphs are evaluated as being either exactly similar up to label permutation or not similar at all .",
    "therefore , practical variations of isomorphism have been developed , including edit distance and maximum common subgraph ( mcs ) @xcite .",
    "the latter has a structure - preserving feature similar to isomorphism .",
    "the mcs of two graphs @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the largest subgraph of @xmath5 that is isomorphic to a subgraph of @xmath6 .    in real - world applications , particularly in biology , graphs of objects",
    "carry different types of information whose level of importance may also differ . to account for real - world properties , the mcs problem has been generalized to the labelled maximum weighted common subgraph ( lmwcs ) problem , where vertices and/or edges are associated with multiple labels , storing various information . for example , in a molecular similarity application , a molecular graph is built where vertices and edges usually represent atoms and atomic bonds , respectively .",
    "the vertices may have labels for atomic numbers and formal charges , and the labels of the edges may indicate the bond types .",
    "it has been shown that the mcs and lmwcs problems are equivalent to another well - known problem  the maximum independent set ( mis ) of a third graph , which can be induced from the graphs being compared @xcite .",
    "the vertices and edges of the third graph , respectively , represent possible mappings and the conflicts between them .",
    "the goal of the mis problem is to find the largest set of vertices such that there is no edge between all selected pairs , forming the largest conflict - free mapping .    representing the mcs problem as the mis problem makes it easier to further relax the definition of similarity where the data is noisy or distorted .",
    "in such contexts , the definition of similarity based on exact subgraph matching might be prohibitive , excluding useful information .",
    "for example , in three - dimensional graph representation of molecules , the position of each atom is obtained relative to the other atoms by solving an optimization problem heuristically .",
    "therefore , the graph representation is partially accurate .",
    "a more flexible similarity measure can compensate for the effect of noise in the data , considering as similar substructures with conflicts up to a certain tolerable threshold . even if there is no perturbation in the data , relaxing the definition of similarity can be beneficial .",
    "for example , to compare a newly sequenced genome with a reference genome , relaxing the definition of similarity allows the regular variations that occur within populations to be accommodated .",
    "there are different relaxations of the exact subgraph matching requirement in the literature @xcite .",
    "one of the relaxations is known as the maximum co-@xmath0-plex problem , where the goal is to find the largest set of vertices in the graph such that each vertex has at most @xmath7 edges connecting it to the other vertices .",
    "it is clear that the maximum co-@xmath8-plex problem is the mis problem @xcite .",
    "the majority of the similarity methods discussed above , including the mis and maximum co-@xmath0-plex problems , are in general np - hard , having exponentially increasing computational complexity due to the combinatorial nature of graphs @xcite .",

    ", there have been efforts to find heuristics with lower complexity , develop approximation methods , restrict graph structures , or use parallel implementation strategies to solve graph similarity problems @xcite .",
    "these methods , though designed to have polynomially bounded complexity , fail to find the optimal solutions .",
    "it is , furthermore , challenging to evaluate their performance , gaining insights on how much we lose by not using the exact algorithms in the worst case .",
    "recent advances in the ability to utilize quantum mechanical effects in computation have sparked interest in the research community that quantum computing could provide a speed - up in solving classical np - hard optimization problems @xcite .",
    "quantum annealing is one approach to harnessing quantum effects in searching the energy landscapes of optimization problems .",

    "this device finds the minimum value ( i.e. , ground state ) for a special class of objective functions ( i.e. , ising objective functions ) .",
    "the class of objective functions native to the hardware can be translated to quadratic functions of binary variables , and since the hardware can not encode constraints , the device is a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization ( qubo ) problem solver . as a result",

    "the mis problem has been formulated as a qubo problem @xcite ; however , to our knowledge there is no qubo problem formulation that considers the relaxation of the exact subgraph matching . in this section ,",
    "we first review the existing formulation of the mis problem .",

    "finally , we explain how to quantify the similarity between the labelled graphs given the solution to the qubo problem formulation .",
    "as discussed , there is a mapping between the mis and lmwcs problems . here ,",
    "we review the qubo problem formulation for the latter problem and then show how it can be converted into a qubo problem for the mis problem .",
    "let us consider two arbitrary graphs @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to formulate the lmwcs problem as a qubo problem , one binary variable @xmath11 , defined below , is assigned to each possible pair @xmath12 .",
    "the weight of each pair is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "a @xmath14 configuration of binary variables @xmath11 depicts a common subgraph between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "for example , in a biology application , only the vertices with the same atomic number might be paired together .",
    "let us further define two sets to impose , respectively , the bijection and user - defined constraints on the mapping : @xmath17    the qubo problem formulation of the lmwcs problem is equivalent to the following formulation for all @xmath18 @xcite : @xmath19    the first expression in the above formulation maximizes the weights of the selected pairs of vertices and the second expression penalizes the infeasible assignments due either to the bijection requirement @xmath20 or the user - defined requirements @xmath21 .",
    "an example of the latter requirements is when the user is interested in finding the maximum common clique between two graphs .",
    "the set @xmath21 then includes @xmath22 if @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the degree of freedom represented as set @xmath21 allows the enforcement of customized structure restrictions on the resulting mcs . to convert formulation to an mis formulation , we introduce a third graph called a conflict graph .",
    "formally , let @xmath25 be the conflict graph of graphs @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the vertices of the conflict graph are 2-tuples of the labelled graph vertices .",
    "all possible 2-tuples are not necessarily the vertices of the conflict graph ",
    "some pairs might be excluded by the user based on predetermined criteria .",
    "the edges of the conflict graph represent both the bijection and the user - defined requirements , defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "that is , there is an edge between two vertices @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the conflict graph if and only if the tuple of the corresponding pairings @xmath30 exists in @xmath31 .",
    "the edges are called _ conflicts _ because they identify the pairs that can not be present in the common subgraph simultaneously . therefore , it is straightforward to see that the mis of the conflict graph @xmath32 corresponds to the mcs of graphs @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the qubo problem formulation for the mis problem of the conflict graph is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a binary variable that is equal to 1 if the vertex @xmath35 is included in the independent set and 0 otherwise , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "it can be demonstrated that both qubo problem formulations and are equivalent by a simple notation transformation .",
    "a co-@xmath0-plex of a graph @xmath39 is a subgraph of @xmath39 in which each vertex has a degree of at most @xmath7 .",

    "each vertex in the conflict graph can have up to @xmath7 edges .",
    "therefore , we only penalize in situations where a subset of the vertices induces a subgraph in which there is one vertex with degree greater than @xmath7 . in other words , we penalize all subsets of vertices whose induced subgraph forms a star graph of size @xmath0 .    further , let us define the binary parameter @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the vertices of the conflict graph @xmath32 .",
    "the qubo problem formulation of the maximum co-@xmath0-plex is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a binary variable equal to 1 if the vertex @xmath47 is included in the mis or 0 otherwise , and @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is a tunable parameter that should be determined by the user .",
    "the above formulation allows both bijection and user - defined conflicts to be present in the mis .",
    "however , the formulation can be modified as below to exclude any bijection conflicts in the independent set of the conflict graph for @xmath49 : @xmath50    as mentioned in section [ subsec : lwmcs_formulation ] , the set @xmath20 includes pairs of vertex sets @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( alternatively , the vertices of the conflict graph ) that can not be simultaneously present in the common subgraph ( alternatively , the independent set of the conflict graph ) .",
    "therefore , the second expression in formulation penalizes the conflict edges due to the bijection requirement .",
    "note that the definition of @xmath51 also slightly differs in this case : it equals 1 if vertices @xmath44 induce a star graph of @xmath52 whose edges are only the elements of set @xmath21 , that is , the user - defined constraints",

    "an example of a multiple graph similarity problem in molecular biology is the comparison of an unknown molecule with several sets of molecules to find the set that is the most similar .",
    "other examples are human face recognition , where the goal is to find an image in a database that best matches several images of the same person taken from different angles @xcite , and graph prototype construction in clustering and classification contexts , in order to best represent all elements of a set of labelled graphs @xcite .",
    "let us formally assume that there are @xmath53 labelled graphs @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , to compare .",
    "an obvious strategy is to find the maximum weighted common subgraph of graph pair @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 and then infer the global maximum weighted common subgraph . following this strategy",

    "the vertex set of the conflict graph of @xmath53 graphs , @xmath60 , is a subset of the product of @xmath61 .",

    "our metric is the convex combination of two existing similarity measures  bunk and shearer , and asymmetric @xcite providing the user with more flexibility ( see section [ sec : exp_result ] for more details ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we utilize our qubo - based graph similarity measure in the context of molecular similarity .",

    "determining similarity between compounds is practical due to the _ similar property principle _ @xcite , which states that structurally similar molecules are expected to display similar properties .",
    "therefore , various aims in biological research can be accomplished by determining structural similarity between molecules .",
    "similarity , however , is a complicated concept to evaluate since it is not a measurable property of the molecules themselves .",
    "indeed , it may have different interpretations depending on external criteria .",
    "this ambiguity increases the difficulty of developing an accurate computational method for determining molecular similarity .    to build a measure of molecular similarity",
    ", three basic components are required : a molecular representation that not only encodes relevant molecular features but also contains their associated weights , a method that compares molecular representations , and a function that evaluates their similarity .",
    "many similarity measures have been proposed in the literature which can be categorized into two classes .",
    "the first class of measures uses the intuitive representation of the molecular atom - bond structure as a graph .",
    "comparison of molecules based on graph representations is often accomplished using graph similarity techniques . as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] , the computational cost of graph similarity techniques has resulted in the development of algorithms for specific graph structures .",
    "these approaches present limitations on the types of objects that can be used for comparison .",
    "however , the qubo - based measure presented in this paper is applicable to any arbitrary graph .",
    "the second class of measures uses a vector - based representation called fingerprint , a conventional concept in chemical informatics and related fields .",
    "fingerprints are binary vectors that indicate the presence or absence of certain features of a molecule",
    ". each bit can be either 1 or 0 , representing whether or not the molecule contains an associated feature .",
    "molecules modelled as fingerprints are compared using vector - based comparison measures such as tanimoto , cosine , dice , and euclidean distance @xcite .",
    "although fingerprints are easy to use and their pairwise comparisons are computationally efficient , they have certain drawbacks .",
    "for instance , fingerprints can not be used to assess for certain whether a particular pattern is present or not in a molecular graph @xcite . when a bit in the fingerprint is set to @xmath8 for some pattern ,",
    "it means that the pattern is present in the molecule only with some probability .",
    "furthermore , fingerprint - based approaches do not usually consider underlying information about the molecular topology .    in the next section ,",

    ", a molecular graph - based representation can be categorized into two classes based on the structural dimensionality of the molecule , that is , two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) . in the former representation , each vertex is associated with one atom and there is an edge between two vertices indicating their chemical bond .",
    "the latter representation includes 3d structural information .",
    "for example , in the 3d molecular graph introduced by raymond and willett @xcite , there is an edge between each pair of vertices indicating the geometrical distance between the two corresponding atoms .",
    "since a graph is an abstract mathematical object , vertices and edges do not need to correlate with atoms and bonds directly .",
    "hence , vertices could represent a group of atoms , given some meaningful criteria .",
    "accordingly , a reduced representation of the chemical structures reduces the size of the graphs being compared and thus increases the effectiveness of the algorithms to solve the mis ( or its relaxation ) problem . in this paper , we build a labelled reduced graph representation of a molecule .",

    "the first step is to construct the atom - bond graph .",
