    "when modeling physical systems , the carrier space ( space of states or space of events ) is usually equipped with some background mathematical structure ( for instance , vector space structure and euclidean metric in elementary mechanics , hilbert space structure and commutation relations for quantum mechanics , and so on ) . with the advent of general relativity and the ambition to have a theory of the universe as a whole it is necessary to minimize the use of mathematical structures as given a priori .",
    "actually the einstein general approach to physics has this goal :    _ one of the imperfections of the original relativistic theory of gravitation was that as a field theory it was not complete : it introduced the independent postulate that the law of motion of a particle is given by an equation of geodesic .",
    "a complete theory knows only fields and not the concepts of particle and motion . for",
    "these must not exist independently of the field , but are to be treated as part of it _ @xcite .    in a footnote of the same paper , einstein and rosen wrote , on the stress - energy tensor representing the source in the einstein equations :    _ it was clear from the very beginning that this was only a provisory complexion of the theory in the sense of a phenomenological interpretation . _    in any case ,",
    "no matter what the motivation may be , it seems desirable to revisit elementary mechanics starting with few assumptions and adding new ones when they are required to resolve ambiguities , if any . in this note",
    "we would like to consider the minimal assumptions which may give rise to special relativity and galilean relativity and make clear which assumptions will discriminate between them and what are the compatibilities with the space structure .",
    "it should be remembered that the problem of deriving special relativity without supposing _ a priori _ the constancy of the light speed has been discussed by many authors ( some of them are quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to better compare different relativity theories",
    ", we shall start with a four - dimensional smooth manifold m as a carrier space for the description of the evolution of point particles ( _ i.e. _ , we start with the space of events ) . by using a coordinate system",
    "say @xmath0 , we consider the equations of motion in the form @xmath1 as a simplifying assumption we require our carrier space to be diffeomorphic to @xmath2 .",
    "we are now in a position to define a _",
    "free system _ on our space .",
    "the motion is said to be a free motion if there is a ( global ) coordinate system @xmath3 , such that the equations of motion acquire the form @xmath4 the parameter @xmath5 is attached to the particular dynamical system we start with and has nothing to do with space - time variables .",
    "any such coordinate system @xmath6 will define an affine structure on the carrier space inducing the one from @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that the notion of straight line , or , more generally , of affine space on the space of events is _ frame dependent_. in addition , in each frame we must select , first of all , a coordinate , say @xmath7 , to be associated with a notion of _",
    "evolution_.    any solution @xmath8 of our free equation which represents the _ world - line _ of an existing object for the given frame must be such that @xmath9 along the _ world - line _ ( in what follows we shall use @xmath10 ) .",
    "after the choice of a single _ world - line _ has been made , the translation group can be used to move it and thereby to construct a congruence of _ world - lines _ which can be thought of as solutions of a vector field @xmath11 on the carrier space . because the translation group is a symmetry group for ( 2 ) ,",
    "these _ world - lines _ are all solutions of ( 2 ) .",
    "we now introduce a closed 1-form @xmath12 , invariant under the translation group , such that @xmath13 .",
    "this 1-form @xmath12 defines a family of 3-planes for @xmath2 ( a foliation ) , transversal to the congruence defined by @xmath11 .",
    "as the _ world - lines _ associated with @xmath11 are solutions of ( 2 ) , se say that @xmath14 is an inertial frame . for any such frame",
    ", we can define _ time - like _ vectors as those @xmath15 which satisfy @xmath16",
    ". they will be future pointing if @xmath17 .",
    "we can say that a point @xmath18 is in the past of @xmath19 if @xmath18 can be connected to @xmath20 by a curve whose tangent vectors are future oriented .",
    "similarly we can define a point in the future of @xmath20 .",
    "these comments are meant to stress that @xmath12 and @xmath11 allow us to define most of the standard non metric structures on space - time ( if we had given a metric structure it would have been possible to define @xmath12 from @xmath11 and the metric ) .",
    "any _ time - like world - line _ , equipped with a map associating in a monotonic way a real number to each event on the _ world - line ( clock ) _ will be called an _ observer_. in our approach a clock can be associate to each _ time - like world - line _ by considering the pull - back of @xmath12 to it .    specifically , this can be done by defining @xmath21 by setting @xmath22 . the induced map @xmath23 is clearly monotonic because of @xmath13 .",
    "the pair @xmath14 defines a family of observers with temporal evolution along @xmath11 and _ rest frames _ associated with @xmath24 .",
    "two inertial systems @xmath25 and @xmath26 are compatible if @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "two compatible systems will perceive the _ world - lines _ of each other as representing some physical entities ; for this reason the requirement @xmath29 will be called the _ mutual objective existence _ condition .",
    "we shall make the choice @xmath30",
    ".    for any pair of inertial frames , say @xmath31 , @xmath32 , we can define relative clocks by setting @xmath33 given by @xmath34 here @xmath35 is determined by the intersection point of the two observers in @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "if the two observers belong to the same inertial frame , @xmath35 is determined by their intersection with any common rest frame .",
    "this view point makes clear that the notion of inertial system is related to the dynamical evolution of some chosen _ comparison system _ via the selection of a congruence of solutions .",
    "it should be stressed that with the assumption that our carrier space is diffeomorphic with @xmath2 , all _ free systems _ are diffeomorphic to each other . by using the linear structure induced by an inertial reference frame , we find that the inhomogeneous general linear group @xmath36 acts transitively on the set of solutions of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "now we shall look for relativity transformations , _",
    "i.e. _ transformations connecting pairs of inertial systems , say @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and require that they form a subgroup of @xmath36 .",
    "by selecting one fiducial inertial system @xmath39 we parametrize all others connected to it by the elements of the relativity group we are searching for .",
    "the restrictions on the accepted relativity transformations means that a _ particle _ at rest in one inertial frame can not be perceived by another one as a particle _ existing _ all over a real line only at a given instant of time , and .    from the point of view of the transformation group ( _ i.e. _ transformations connecting physically equivalent systems )",
    "we have to exclude the possibility of exchanging _ time- _ and _ space- _ axes .",
    "for instance , we should exclude from admissible _ relativity transformations _ those closing on a subgroup of @xmath36 which contains rotations in the _ time - space _ planes .",
    "we shall now describe how to construct these _ relativity ( sub)-groups_. the main idea of our procedure consists of looking for the transformation groups which transform an inertial system into another one compatible with the _ mutual objective existence _ condition .",
    "this is translated in the requirement that a _ transformed @xmath12 _ , say @xmath40 should not contain @xmath11 in the kernel , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    before carrying on this program we shall consider some preliminary aspects ( sections 2 - 4 ) .",
    "given a second order differential equation on space - time , say @xmath43 we ask under which conditions we can find a new coordinate system in which the equation becomes @xmath4 clearly , by performing a change of coordinates @xmath44 , we find :    @xmath45 _ i.e. _    @xmath46    if we compute the curvature associated with this connection , we find    @xmath47 as a matter of fact this condition turns out to be also sufficient to go from ( 3 ) to ( 4 ) .    as in general",
    "we are not requiring the force @xmath48 in ( 11 ) to be quadratic in the velocities , this sufficiency condition should be stated in the framework of generalized connections associated with any second order vector field @xcite @xcite :    @xmath49=0.\\ ] ]    in the particular case our starting system is in the form of a spray    @xmath50 we have    @xmath51 thus , relation ( 5 ) is necessary and sufficient condition for a second order differential equation to represent a free system on @xmath2 .    in coming section",
    "we shall describe a constructive procedure to find these special reference frames .",
    "starting with a second order equation on @xmath52 , say    @xmath53 we can define a _ natural coordinate system _ for any neighbourhood @xmath54 in the following way .",
    "we consider a fiducial point @xmath55 and the tangent space @xmath56 .",
    "with any vector @xmath57 we associate a point in @xmath52 by looking for the ( unique ) solution of ( 1 ) originating at @xmath55 with initial velocity @xmath58 .",
    "the flow @xmath59 , associated with ( 1 ) , defines a map by restriction    @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the point in @xmath62 reached after a _ time _ @xmath5 via the solution of ( 1 ) with initial conditions @xmath63 .",
    "in particular the application @xmath64 may be considered as a generalization to a generic second order equation of the standard exponential map for geodesic equations .    for simplicity , we assume that ( 1 ) defines a complete vector field on @xmath65 . in this hypothesis the particular map we have constructed",
    "is defined for any @xmath57 injectively ( we recall that @xmath52 is diffeomorphic to @xmath2 by assumption and our considerations apply to a neighbourhood @xmath62 of @xmath55 ) . in particular we may define an addition rule on @xmath62 by setting @xmath66 .",
    "the vector space structure induced on @xmath62 for each , complete , second order vector field on @xmath52 , depends on @xmath55 . when these vector space structures on @xmath62 are linearly related , _",
    "i.e. _ transition functions are linear maps , our starting equation ( 1 ) reduces to a _ free particle _ equation . when moving from a point @xmath55 to a point @xmath67 we go from the vector space structure associated with @xmath56 to the one associated to @xmath68 , this can be done _ transporting _ one vector space onto the other along the _ solution curve _",
    "connecting @xmath67 to @xmath55 .    depending on @xmath55 and @xmath67",
    "this connection map may fail to be _ linear _ up to some order depending on the _ extension _ of the neighbourhood , the set of points we may reach from @xmath69 by using _",
    "solution curves _ while keeping the _ linearity _ violated to no more than some preassigned power @xmath70 in the parameters will be a @xmath70-order local inertial frame .",
    "when equation ( 5 ) is satisfied , this procedure defines a global linear inertial frame .",
    "we start with an inertial frame , _",
    "i.e. _ a reference inertial frame described by @xmath14 , giving rise to a global coordinate system @xmath71 . we notice that a particular form for @xmath12 would be @xmath72 .",
    "it is worth stressing that a different choice of the congruence ( _ i.e. _ a different choice of @xmath11 ) in general may give rise to a different class of inertial systems .",
    "having found one coordinate system in which the equation of motions have the form ( 2 ) , how many of them exist ?",
    "it is clear we have to look for all coordinate systems @xmath73 such that    @xmath74    as    @xmath75 by using    @xmath76 we find    @xmath77 _ i.e. _ , @xmath78 must be linear in @xmath79 ( it can be however any function of constants of the motion for system ( 2 ) ) .",
    "we consider therefore    @xmath80    in terms of the initial conditions , we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 stays for @xmath83 .    _",
    "_    as constants of the motion , say , for our comparison dynamics satisfy @xmath84 , it is clear that @xmath78 can be any function of them in addition to the explicit dependence on ( @xmath85 ) . here",
    ", we only consider the dependence on constants of the motion ( @xmath86 ) and do not consider a possible dependence on other constants of motion .",
    "this is a simplifying assumption useful for computations because @xmath87 parametrize the position - velocity phase space .",
    "because our approach to inertial frames is a dynamical one , there is no reason to restrict our transformations to be _ point transformations _",
    "( _ i.e. _ to tangent bundle automorphisms , to use the language from differential geometry ) . therefore , _ new _ velocities need not be linear functions of the _ old _ velocities .",
    "the congruence of curves corresponding to    @xmath88 will be given by    @xmath89 where ( @xmath90 ) can be any smooth function of @xmath91 .",
    "at this point we look for linear transformations on a given pair @xmath14 with the requirement that any transformed one still satisfies @xmath92 , @xmath93 , _ i.e. _ our transformations generate new inertial frames satisfying the _ mutual objective existence_. from here we shall be able to construct the relativity groups which are compatible with our requirement .    as usual",
    ", we can dispose of the translation part and concentrate our analysis on the linear homogeneous part .    by using a passive point of view",
    ", we can consider our transformations from @xmath2 to @xmath2 , preserving the origin .",
    "we shall therefore consider linear transformations @xmath94 , with the additional requirement @xmath95 , to implement @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "here we think of the choice @xmath96 .",
    "we have a preliminary lemma :    _ any invertible linear transformation , _",
    "@xmath97 , _ which , along with its inverse , preserves the time - like character can be decomposed into the product of a linear transformation in the _ @xmath98_-plane and two space - like transformations_.    we denote by @xmath99 our generic transformation and apply it to a standard vector :    @xmath100 where @xmath101 by assumption .",
    "now , by using a space - transformation @xmath102 , we can transform @xmath103 therefore @xmath104 by using a linear transformation @xmath105 in the @xmath98-plane , acting as the identity in the remaining components and preserving the _ time - like _ character , we find    @xmath106    by using the arbitrariness of the starting time - like vector , we find that @xmath107 is a space - transformation and we get the decomposition    @xmath108    this decomposition lemma allows us to deal first with transformations in the @xmath98 plane to find out which ones are compatible with the requirement on the _ objective existence _ condition and then to compose them .",
    "this analysis will be done in the following sections .",
    "having reduced our problem to a two - dimensional one , it is easy to visualize the situation .",
    "a vector @xmath11 is given and we should consider all those linear transformations in @xmath109 which never take a vector transversal to @xmath11 ( defined by @xmath24 ) into one parallel to @xmath11 . if we think of a one - parameter group of transformations connecting two allowed frames , for any infinitesimal generator @xmath110 , there will never be a value of the parameter @xmath111 for which @xmath112 is parallel to @xmath11 .    at this point",
    "it is convenient to decompose any element of @xmath113 into the product of an element in @xmath114 and a dilation . because dilations are in the center of @xmath113 they can be dealt with separately .",
    "thus , we may restrict our analysis to @xmath114 .",
    "for this analysis it is very convenient to notice that @xmath114 is the same as @xmath115,_i.e . _ the group of canonical transformations in a two - dimensional phase - space . from this point of view",
    ", a matrix @xmath110 is associated with some hamiltonian function whose level sets contain the orbits of the one - parameter group associated with @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that the family of inertial frames we obtain from a given one with the action of the one - parameter group @xmath116 , is associated with a quadratic form , the hamiltonian function _ generating _ @xmath110 , up to a numerical factor .",
    "thus we are led to analyse quadratic forms on @xmath109 in connection with the _ placement _ of @xmath117 in space - time , keeping in mind that their level sets contain the orbits of the _ relativity transformation group _ we are searching for .",
    "the infinitesimal transformation @xmath110 associated with a transformation matrix @xmath118 which tends to the unit of the group when its parameters tend to zero , has the form    @xmath119 the evolution of the vector @xmath120 is described by @xmath121 where @xmath122 if @xmath110 does not admit real eigenvalues , it will define a rotation - like transformation ( _ i.e. _ level sets of @xmath123 are ellipses ) and will violate the _ mutual objective existence _ ( in what follows _ m.o.e .",
    "_ ) condition .",
    "we assume therefore that @xmath110 has real eigenvalues .",
    "we get : @xmath124 eigen - directions are defined by @xmath125 and , in terms of them , we may write @xmath126 the solution of eq . ( 7 ) corresponding to the initial conditions @xmath127",
    "is given by @xmath128    moreover , the ratio @xmath129 , when @xmath130 , tends to @xmath131 , independently of the value of the initial conditions . as a consequence , these quantities are characteristic invariants of the transformation .",
    "the quantities @xmath132 are also invariant .",
    "finally , with the substitution @xmath133 , the transformation matrix in ( 9 ) takes the form @xmath134 here @xmath135 plays the role of parameter of the transformation ; no ambiguity arises if we continue to indicate it with @xmath136 .",
    "the level set corresponding to @xmath137 determines the asymptotes of the branches of the hyperbolas defined by @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the asymptotes coincide with the _ eigen - directions _ of @xmath99 .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath99 , associated to @xmath123 , will define an acceptable relativity transformation only if @xmath24 intersects the branches corresponding to @xmath140 and @xmath11 the branches corresponding to @xmath141 ( or viceversa , and then we redefine the group parameter so that @xmath24 always intersects the negative branch ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath99 ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) can not transform a vector whose second component is zero in a vector whose first component is zero .    a priori , for a given pair @xmath14 , we shall find several quadratic functions @xmath123 satisfying previous requirements , therefore we may think that a combination of them would be also acceptable .",

    "the physical interpretation of these transformations and the related problems , like the clock synchronization one , have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "some further intermediate situations are possible .",
    "they correspond to the use of galilei - type trasnformations in some _ one time - ome space _ planes and lorentz type in the remaining ones .",
    "these situatiomns are obtained when some of the coefficients of the rprevious quadratic form are being set equal to zero , say @xmath187 and @xmath188 being different from zero , or @xmath189 , @xmath188 being different from zero .",
    "we have found that the notion of _ mutual objective existence _ along with the identity of relative clocks is enough to select only the galilei and lorentz transformations in one space and one time setting .",
    "these transformations preserve a quadratic form which is degenerate in the galileian case and not degenerate in the lorentz case .    when going to @xmath190 , we find that the _ mutual objective existence _ condition determines a minkowski - type metric in the case of the lorentz group , while the galilei - type group does not impose restrictions on the space structure .",
    "some intermediate situations are also possible .",
    "it is possible to have lorentz - type behaviour in some directions and galilei - type behaviour in the complementary directions .",
    "these mixed situations can not be ruled out only on the basis of the _ mutual objective existence _ condition and some additional physical insight is needed .",
