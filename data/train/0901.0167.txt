    "the radio - loudness phenomenon , i.e. the dominance of radio over optical emission , is still poorly understood .",
    "basically , it is known that a small percentage of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) displays this type of activity , which is commmonly ascribed to the presence of a relativistic jet ( urry & padovani 1995 ) , but the physics necessary to explain the generation , collimation , and evolution of the jet is yet to be known ( e.g. blandford 2001 ) . among the possible ways to investigate this problem , one is to study the population of radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nlsy1 ) . indeed ,",
    "nlsy1  as a peculiar subclass of seyferts  are generally radio - quiet , but a small percentage ( @xmath2% , komossa et al .",
    "2006 ) of this population is radio - loud , _",
    "i.e. _ , with the ratio @xmath3 between the @xmath0  ghz and b filter ( @xmath4 ) flux densities greater than @xmath5 , according to the definition by kellermann et al .",
    "therefore , it is worth investigating this type of sources to understand the origin of the radio loudness and , if due to a relativistic jet , how this is possible in a population of active nuclei that are mostly radio quiet .",
    "after a few isolated cases of radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. padovani et al .",
    "2002 ) and early surveys ( e.g. zhou & wang 2002 , komossa et al .",
    "2006 , whalen et al .",
    "2006 ) , the advent of the _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) made it possible to perform large scale surveys ( zhou et al .",
    "2006 , yuan et al .",
    "particularly , komossa et al . ( 2006 ) , with a sample including also sources with weak radio loudness ( @xmath6 ) , found that most of radio loud nlsy1 are resembling to ghz - peaked / compact steep spectrum sources ( gps / css ) , which in turn are believed to be the young stage of quasars ( e.g. guainazzi et al .",
    "2006 , stawarz et al .",
    "yuan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) analyzed a sample of strong radio loud objects ( @xmath7 ) and suggested similarities with high - energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbl ) .",
    "specifically , yuan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) claim to have found examples of `` high - frequency peaked flat spectrum radio quasars '' ( hfsrq , see padovani 2007 ) , which are quasars with synchrotron peak in the x - rays .",
    "this type of source is not foreseen by the classical `` blazar sequence '' ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 , ghisellini et al . 1998 ) and therefore the discovery of such types of sources can represent a failure in the `` sequence '' . although some examples have been suggested ( see padovani 2007 for a review ) , no conclusive evidence has been presented .",
    "in addition , ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2008 ) recently suggested that such type sources can exist and can be in agreement with the sequence by assuming that the jet is dissipating most of its energy beyond the broad - line region .",
    "therefore , since the study of radio - loud nlsy1 could have impact on the understanding of radio - loudness and the blazar sequence , we engaged in a study of a sample of these sources , by taking advantage of the power of _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift _ in giving simultaneous optical / uv / x - rays data .",

    "[ fig:3c273 ] shows the x - ray flux density at @xmath10  kev versus @xmath33 for 3c  @xmath34 , a source thought to contain both a seyfert - like nucleus and a relativistic jet ( grandi & palumbo 2004 ) . in this case",
    ", the x - ray spectrum displays a steepening with increasing flux , although the photon index is generally harder than that typical of a nlsy1 .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the x - ray spectrum alone is not sufficient to distinguish between a blazar - like or seyfert - like behaviour .",
    "it is necessary to analyze also the radiation at optical / uv wavelengths . in blazars ,",
    "the emission at these frequencies is dominated by the jet and is therefore correlated with x - rays . in seyferts ,",
    "the optical / uv radiation is dominated by the accretion disk and the host galaxy , while the x - ray continuum is generated by a thermally comptonized corona .",
    "therefore , different pattern of variability and correlations are expected ( e.g. nandra & papadakis 2001 ) .    among the sources analyzed in the present work ,",
    "1h  @xmath12 is the most interesting case : it shows some correlation with optical and uv fluxes at the highest x - ray fluxes , where the x - ray spectra can be well fitted with a broken power - law model extending to hard x - rays ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1629 ] , _ right column _",
    "; in these cases , indicated with a filled circle , the figure displays only the soft photon index ) .",
    "indeed , this source has been already detected by _ integral _ ( bird et al .",
    "2007 , krivonos et al .",
    "2007 , malizia et al . 2007 ) , but it was indicated as a normal seyfert active nucleus and none underlined the peculiar properties of this source .",
    "we reanalyzed with ` osa 7.0 ` all the publicly available _",
    "integral_/ibis data , for a total exposure of @xmath37  ks ( performed in @xmath38 , revolution @xmath39 ) , and we detected the source at @xmath40  mcrab flux level in the @xmath41  kev energy band ( @xmath42 significance ) , but there was no detection in the @xmath43  kev band , with an upper limit of @xmath44  mcrab .",

    "therefore , 1h  @xmath12 shows a strong flux and spectral variability : low flux and soft spectrum during the _ integral _ observation and high flux and hard spectrum during the _ swift _ pointings .    , with a possible model ( continuous lines ) including disk ( dotted line ) and jet emission ( dashed lines ) .",
    "green and red colors indicate two different states of the source . ]",
    "the presence of such a hard x - ray component , together with an increase of optical / uv fluxes , can be likely attributed to a jet .",
    "1h  @xmath12 appears to be like a x - ray selected flat - spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq , see maraschi et al .",
    "2008 ) , where , during quiescence , the x - ray emission is dominated by a corona and the jet contribution is negligible , while the contrary occurs during outbursts .",
    "the jet radiation overwhelming the corona is indicated by the emergence of the hard power - law component .",
    "it is not possible to make a firm statement , given the low statistics , but surely this behaviour is very uncharacteristic for a narrow - line seyfert 1 .",
    "also rx  j@xmath25 shows a hard x - ray spectrum ( @xmath50 ) in one pointing , while the remaining pointings display the typical properties of a radio - quiet narrow - line seyfert 1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mkn766 ] , _ left column _ ) .",
    "the case of pks  @xmath29 has been extensively studied by gallo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who also noted a blazar - like behavior of the source , possibly with an additional seyfert component .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well fitted with a broken power - law model with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53  kev .",
    "we note that the soft component ( @xmath54  kev ) is strongly variable ( @xmath55% ) , while the hard one ( @xmath56  kev ) is consistent with a constant ( @xmath57% , @xmath58 upper limit ) .",
    "this suggests a different origin of the two components and a behavior similar to low - frequency peaked bl lacs ( lbl , cf , _",
    "e.g. _ , foschini et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "a similar case is sdss  j@xmath27 .",
    "there are two _ swift _ observations with significant changes in the x - ray spectrum . on june @xmath59 , @xmath60 data , the best fit is obtained using a broken power - law model ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63  kev ) , while @xmath64 days later the x - ray spectrum is best fitted with a single power - law model ( @xmath65 ) . the x - ray and uv fluxes increase from the first observation to the second one .",
    "we decided to try a fit of the sed built with these two _ swift _ observations ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sdss ] ) and we adopted a modified synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model by maraschi & tavecchio ( 2003 ) to which we refer the reader for more details . in the present model , the optical / uv / x - ray emission is generated by a disk plus a jet .",
    "the distribution of electrons is shaped with a broken power - law with index @xmath66 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 and index @xmath69 from the break up to @xmath70 .",
    "the parameters resulting from the fit on the two data sets of sdss  j@xmath27 are basically the same , except for the @xmath70 , which changes from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and @xmath69 , which decreases from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "the x - ray emission of the low state ( the broken power - law model indicated above ) is modeled with a synchrotron plus inverse - compton components : the former takes into account the soft x - ray emission up to @xmath75  kev , while the latter can explain the hard x - ray radiation above that energy . in the active state ,",
    "the peak of the synchrotron emission moves to higher frequencies and the x - ray energy band is dominated by this process , the behaviour expected from a hbl .",
    "another possibility is that the jet is dissipating its energy beyond the narrow - line region in nlsy1 , like in the case of rgb  j@xmath11 ( see below ) .",
    "obviously , the final word on this modeling can be written if and when _ fermi _ will detect it : according to our estimates , the source could be already detected after a few months of exposure .    in the case of rgb  j@xmath11",
    "there are some hints of correlation of the highest x - ray fluxes with high uv flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1629 ] , _ left column _ ) . for the modeling , it was assumed that the dissipation of the jet occurs outside the broad - line region and therefore the non - thermal emission can be modeled with a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model .",
    "see maraschi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for more details .",
    "the analysis of the optical - to - x - ray data presented here suggests that in the class of radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies there are some sources with interesting behavior , in some way similar to blazars .",
    "there is no `` unified way '' for radio - loud nlsy1 to be similar to blazars : basically , in most of the analyzed cases , the x - ray spectrum , generally soft , shows a break with the emergence of a hard component . in one case , the x - ray spectrum can be fitted with a single power - law model with a very hard photon index .",
    "therefore , it appears that there is a seyfert component ( represented by a disk plus a x - ray corona ) , but sometimes the x - ray spectrum shows an evident change of the shape , together with correlated changes in optical and ultraviolet fluxes , suggesting the strengthening of a jet emission .",
    "this occurred at least twice for 1h  @xmath12 and at least once for rx  j@xmath25 , pks  @xmath29 .",
    "the observed changes in spectral shapes and fluxes can be interpreted in the framework of the aborted jets ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2004 ) , but considering that sometimes the jet is launched successfully and then the source becomes radio loud .",
    "another possibility is that the jet dissipates most of its energy beyond the narrow - line region , like the blue quasars of ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2008 ) .",
    "the cases of rgb  j@xmath11 and sdss  j@xmath27 can be explained by this theory .",
    "the flat radio spectra reported by other authors ( zhou et al .",
    "2002 , komossa et al .",
