    "advances in fabrication techniques since the isolation of monolayer graphene@xcite have allowed the realization of a variety of graphene - based applications@xcite . in terms of electronic applications , graphene s high carrier mobility@xcite has enabled its application as an electrical conducting channel@xcite , however , the lack of strong conductance modulation@xcite due to klein tunneling@xcite has limited its utilization for other graphene - based electronic devices .",
    "the modulation of charge carriers in graphene is still a significant issue of ongoing research for graphene nanoelectronics@xcite .",
    "a conductance modulation in graphene can be introduced by utilizing various mechanisms that open an electronic band gap , such as the interaction with susbtrates@xcite , elastic strain@xcite , or finite - size effects in graphene nanoribbons@xcite . aside from the band gap opening ,",
    "however , these methods also introduce unavoidable disorders , such as charge impurities or structural imperfections by substrates@xcite and strong backscattering by rough edges of graphene nanoribbons@xcite , that deteriorate the transport properties of graphene .",
    "an alternative mechanism for band - gap opening , that in principle does not produce any disorder effects in graphene , is the use of inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "particularly , since inhomogeneous magnetic fields can tune the dirac fermion transport in graphene mimicking a typical potential barrier for dirac fermions@xcite , one can produce magnetic confinement effects for graphene carriers@xcite .",
    "these effects have motivated research on various structures , e.g. , magnetically defined quantum dots@xcite , dirac fermion waveguides@xcite , and superlattices@xcite .    besides nanoelectronics , another important aspect of graphene applications is gas sensing@xcite .",
    "the operation principle of a graphene gas sensor relies on measuring the modulated transport properties of graphene that are induced by the adhesion of gas molecules on the graphene surface .",
    "in particular , conductance changes arise from the injection of charged carriers into graphene from adhered gas molecules such as o@xmath0 , no@xmath0 or nh@xmath1 , which play roles of electron donors or acceptors@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that highly sensitive graphene - based gas sensing capable of detecting individual molecule adhesion@xcite is possible , but a large array of sensors might still be required in order to enlarge the exposed area of graphene and thus increase the chances for molecule adhesion at shot - time exposures and minute concentrations .",
    "alternatively , here we explore ways of increasing the minimum exposed area required for single molecule detection without making arrays , which is significant for minimizing device sizes and detection speeds .        here , we theoretically study an alternative possibility for achieving highly sensitive gas sensing , which is to utilize the adsorbate - induced electrochemical doping effects in order to modulate the tunneling resonances ( tr ) and transport band gaps ( tbg ) emerging in magnetic barrier arrays in graphene .",
    "we show that in such graphene sensors the presence of adsorbates introduces strong changes into graphene s electrical conductance .",
    "we take into account two structures for the conductance modulation , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fg : model ] .",
    "first , we consider a periodic array of magnetic barriers in which the inter - barrier regions are exposed to electrochemical adsorbates . in the second case",
    ", we consider a periodic magnetic barrier array with a structural defect , where electrochemical doping is induced only in the defect region .",
    "we investigate the ballistic conductance and its modulation by doping effects for both structures , in different temperature ranges .",
    "specifically , in the zero - temperature limit , the presence of a structural defect leads to sharp resonance peaks in the conductance spectra , that can be sensitively modulated by local doping in the defect region . in finite - temperature cases ,",
    "on the other hand , the overall sensitivity is reduced because of thermal smoothing , but still remains significant within the transport band gaps when a periodic magnetic barrier array with electrochemical doping in - between the barriers is considered . by the same token ,",
    "however , the strong temperature dependence which is regarded as a weak point in terms of gas sensing , can be used for temperature sensing . the highest sensing ability",
    "is expected at lower temperatures , and yields a promising sensing platform for applications in a low - temperature environment .",

    "[ sec : formalism ] , we present the model hamiltonian employed to represent multiple magnetic barriers , and we explain the transfer matrix formalism which is valid in the ballistic regime at finite temperatures . in sec .",
    "[ sec : defect - effects ] , we discuss the features of the defect - induced tunneling resonances in the transmission spectra .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : cond - mod ] we show the calculated results for the sensing effect by local doping in the zero - temperature limit , and in sec .  [",
    "sec : cond - mod10k ] we discuss the large conductance modulation beyond the zero - temperature limit and its temperature dependence .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] contains the conclusions and a summary of our results .",
    "we consider a graphene sheet with a periodic array of magnetic barriers .",
    "magnetic barriers have been experimentally realized by ferromagnetic stripes on top of a graphene sheet@xcite .",

    ", the magnetic barrier width should not exceed a few tens nm .",
    "additionally , the total lateral size of a multiple magnetic barrier array should not be over a few microns so we could still be in ballistic transport regime even at room - temperatures@xcite .    in order to obtain the transmission and reflection probabilities through a single magnetic barrier",

    "we note that in this study we do not need to take into account the zeeman energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gyromagnetic factor for dirac fermions in graphene and @xmath32 is the bohr magneton , because the anti - symmetric magnetic field profiles of each single magnetic barrier yield no spin - dependent transport phenomena@xcite .",

    "we note here that since we are interested in ballistic transport of dirac fermions through the structures , no disorder effects that could lead to energy dissipation by inelastic scattering were included in the our formalism .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath37 is obtained from the transfer matrix by @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath37 is not only a function of the energy but also of the incident angle of the incoming dirac fermions . in the ballistic regime and at finite temperature",

    "is simplified to : @xmath45 next , we consider a monolayer graphene sheet in the presence of a series of magnetic barriers .",

    "note that we set an alternating configuration of the magnetic barriers , i.e. , alternating signs of the vector potentials .",
    "the transfer matrix formalism for multiple magnetic barriers can be extended from the case of the single magnetic barrier : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of magnetic barriers in use , and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the position of @xmath51-th magnetic barrier and @xmath52 is for upward or downward magnetic barriers . in the following sections we assume 20 magnetic barriers periodically arranged with @xmath53  nm , @xmath54  nm , @xmath55  mev and @xmath56  nm .",
    "in this section , we discuss defect - induced resonances and local - doping effects in the transmission probability of dirac fermions through multiple magnetic barriers .",
    "the existence of defect - induced resonances is best demonstrated by comparing the transmission spectra through a periodic array of magnetic barriers without and with a structural defect , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : model](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , and plotted for normal incidence in fig .",
    "[ fg : trans_defect ] .",
    "it is shown that the periodic arrangement of magnetic barriers leads to the existence of transport gaps ( tg ) in specific energy ranges , indicated by shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fg : trans_defect ] .",
    "the emergence of tgs comes from the combination of strong back scattering by the magnetic potentials and quantum interference effects in the periodic structure , similarly to the kronig - penny model .",
    "( the existence of the tg is best understood by the band structure of the infinite magnetic barrier array , shown in appendix  [ app : band_structure ] . ) at energies below the magnetic barrier height ( @xmath57  mev ) , only resonant tunnelings through the multiple magnetic barrier are allowed , with the number of resonances being equal to the number of magnetic barriers .",
    "let us call these resonances for under - barrier tunneling ` bound - state tunneling resonances ' ( btrs ) .",
    "for the defected magnetic barrier array , on the other hand , sharp transmission peaks emerge in the tgs .",

    "we next consider the effect of doping induced by adsorbates on the graphene sheet . in the periodic array case",
    "we assume that all the inter - barrier regions are exposed to adsorbates , while in the defected array case we assume local doping applied to the defect region only , as respectively illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fg : doping_trans ] . in the case of inter - barrier doping of a periodic array without structural defects ,",
    "the transmission spectra are entirely shifted by the doping potential .",
    "this shift is enough to produce strong qualitative changes in the transmission spectra above the barrier height , e.g. at the specific energy @xmath59  mev , where the tg disappears and the transmission of dirac fermions is almost unaffected by doping .",
    "local doping in the defect region , on the other hand , does not lead to a global shift of the transmission spectra , but produces a clear shift of the dtrs : the transmission peaks are shifted , and new ones periodically appear as the local doping potential increases .",

    "the conductance is dominated by under - barrier tunneling through the barriers , resulting into a complete tg within which the conductance values almost vanish .",

    "for plane - wave solutions , the propagating behavior of dirac fermions can be governed by an optical analogy .",

    "now , we can study transmission of dirac fermions through a potential barrier by using the interface and the propagation matrix : @xmath128 the matrix @xmath129 corresponds to the transfer matrix that describes the relation between incoming and outgoing waves .",
