    "in 1978 fisher and de gennes @xcite predicted that the confinement of critical fluctuations of the order parameter in a binary liquid mixture near its critical demixing point @xmath0 gives rise to long - ranged forces between immersed plates or particles .",
    "in particular , they pointed out that these long - ranged forces would eventually lead to the flocculation of colloidal particles which are dissolved in a near - critical binary liquid mixture @xcite .",
    "a few years later , such a solvent - mediated flocculation was observed experimentally for silica spheres immersed in the binary liquid mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine @xcite .",
    "however , the precise interpretation of these experiments is still under debate ; although fluctuation - induced forces as predicted by fisher and de gennes certainly play a major role , additional mechanisms , such as screening effects in the case of charged colloidal particles @xcite , may also contribute @xcite . in the meantime",
    "additional experimental evidence for this kind of flocculation phenomena has emerged for other binary mixtures acting as solvents @xcite .    from a colloid physics perspective",
    "effective , solvent - mediated interactions between dissolved colloidal particles are of basic importance @xcite . the richness of the physical properties of these systems is mainly based on the possibility to tune these effective interactions over wide ranges of strength and form of the interaction potential . traditionally , this tuning is accomplished by changing the chemical composition of the solvent by adding salt , polymers , or other components @xcite . compared with such modifications , changes of the temperature or pressure",
    "typically result only in minor changes of the effective interactions . on the other hand , however , effective interactions generated by bringing solvents close to a phase transition of their own are extremely sensitive to such changes . in this broader context ,",
    "flocculation of colloidal particles induced by critical fluctuations near a _ second - order _ phase transition of the solvent as predicted by fisher and de gennes @xcite provided the first instance in which effective interactions are tuned by changing the physical conditions rather than the chemical composition of the solvent .",
    "later on , this idea has been extended to _ first - order _ transitions of the solvent , for which wetting transitions can occur which give rise to wetting films of the preferred phase coating the colloidal particles @xcite . in the meantime the study of effective interactions between dissolved particles generated by changing the physical conditions of the solvent , and the resulting phase behavior of the colloidal suspension , has emerged as one of the main fields of research in colloid physics @xcite .    the physical origin of the force predicted by fisher and de gennes is analogous to the casimir force between conducting plates , which arises due to the confinement of quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "( related phenomena occur in string theory @xcite , liquid crystals ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and microemulsions @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the present so - called `` critical casimir effect '' , in liquid crystals the director - fluctuation induced forces are notoriously difficult to separate from the background of dispersion forces due to the absence of a singular temperature dependence @xcite . ) in recent years this `` critical casimir effect '' has attracted increasing theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite interest . in this case",
    "the fluctuations are provided by the critical order parameter fluctuations of a bona fide second - order phase transition in the corresponding bulk sample . for he@xmath3 wetting films close to the superfluid phase transition the theoretical predictions @xcite for critical casimir forces between parallel surfaces exhibiting dirichlet boundary conditions",
    "have been confirmed quantitatively @xcite .",
    "these quantum fluids offer the opportunity to study critical casimir forces in the absence of surface fields , i.e. , the purely fluctuation induced forces .    in a classical binary liquid mixture near its critical demixing point ,",
    "the order parameter is a suitable concentration difference between the two species forming the liquid . in this case",
    "the inevitable preference of confining boundaries for one of the two species results in the presence of effective surface fields leading to nonvanishing order parameter profiles even at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "( this is the case discussed by fisher and de gennes @xcite . )",
    "these so - called `` critical adsorption '' profiles become particularly long - ranged due to the correlation effects induced by the critical fluctuations of the order parameter of the solvent . in the case of a planar wall , critical adsorption has been studied in much detail @xcite .",
    "asymptotically close to the critical point @xmath0 it is characterized by a surface field which is infinitely large so that the order parameter profile actually diverges upon approaching the wall up to atomic distances . later on , critical adsorption on curved surfaces of _ single _ spherical and rodlike colloidal particles has been studied , where it turns out , in particular , that critical adsorption on a microscopically thin `` needle '' represents a distinct universality class of its own @xcite .",
    "critical adsorption on the rough interface between the critical fluid and its noncritical vapor occurring at the critical end point of the binary liquid mixture has been addressed as well @xcite ; likewise the effect of quenched surface modulations and roughness @xcite .",
    "the interference of critical adsorption on _ neighboring spheres _ gives rise to the critical casimir forces which have been argued to contribute to the occurrence of flocculation near @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , a quantitative understanding of these phenomena requires the knowledge of the critical adsorption profiles near the colloidal particles and the resulting effective free energy of interaction in the whole vicinity of the critical point , i.e. , as function of both the reduced temperature @xmath1 and the bulk field @xmath2 conjugate to the order parameter .",
    "so far , this ambitious goal has not yet been accomplished . instead",
    ", the introduction of the additional complication of a surface curvature has limited the knowledge of the corresponding critical adsorption so far to the case of spheres for the particular thermodynamic state @xmath5 of the solvent @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "at least the temperature dependence of the critical casimir force between a sphere and a planar container wall has been discussed .",

    "@xcite also the force @xmath7 between a pair of spheres of radius @xmath8 at distance @xmath9 between their centers ( see fig.[fig_geo ] ) has been briefly analyzed .",
    "close to the critical demixing point , this force separates into a regular background contribution and a singular contribution @xmath10 of universal character , which is _ attractive _ if the same of the two coexisting bulk phases is enriched near both spheres .",
    "the results for @xmath10 can be cast into the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the _ true _ correlation length governing the exponential decay of the order parameter correlation function in the bulk for @xmath13 at @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the correlation length governing the exponential decay of the order parameter correlation function for @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
