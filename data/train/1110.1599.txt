    "the extremes of stationary processes , especially of gaussian processes , have attracted significant interest for a long time .",
    "many results are described in the books @xcite and @xcite , with shorter versions in @xcite and @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", these results can be categorized as follows : the exact distributions of the suprema have been calculated for several particular processes ; bounds on the supremum distribution have been obtained for a large number of processes ; the asymptotic behavior of the level crossing probability has been studied for a larger number of processes . almost without exception ,",
    "however , these results deal with the value of the supremum , while very little is known about the random location of the supremum .",
    "the present work arises from an obvious attempt to understand the effect of stationarity of the process on the distribution of the location of the supremum . therefore in this paper , we look at stationary stochastic processes in continuous , one - dimensional time and we will consider the location of its global supremum over a compact interval .",
    "it turns out that answering even this , apparently simple question leads to unexpected insights .",
    "we now discuss our setup more formally .",
    "let @xmath0 be a stationary process .",
    "if the sample paths of the process are upper semi - continuous , then the process is bounded from above on any compact interval @xmath1 $ ] , and its supremum over that interval is attained .",
    "we are interested in the location of that supremum within the interval @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "it is , of course , entirely possible that the supremum of the process in the interval @xmath1 $ ] is not unique ( i.e. , that it is achieved at more than one point ) . in that case",
    "one could be more specific and take , for example , the left - most point in which the largest value over the interval is achieved , as the location of the supremum .",
    "in this paper we will sometimes deal with the situation in which , on an event of probability 1 , the supremum is achieved at a single point . in either case",
    "it is easy to check that the location of the supremum is a well defined random variable .",
    "will the stationarity of the process guarantee a uniform distribution of the location of the supremum over the interval ?",
    "the answer is negative .",
    "the examples in section 9.4 of @xcite show that even in the case of gaussian processes with a uniquely attained supremum ( thus eliminating a possible bias resulting from taking the leftmost supremum location ) , the supremum can still be located , with a positive probability , at one of the endpoints of the interval and , furthermore , the remaining mass in the interior of the interval does not have to be uniformly distributed there .",
    "it is , of course , the endpoints of the interval that are responsible for the lack of uniformity . in a sense ,",
    "the points near the ends of the interval have `` fewer local competitors '' for being the supremum than the points further from the endpoints do .",
    "but exactly how far from having the uniform distribution can the location of the supremum be ?",
    "in this paper we give a very detailed answer to this question by showing that this distribution is absolutely continuous in the interior of the interval and describing very specific conditions its density must satisfy .",
    "this is done in section  [ secassumptions ] .",
    "our results turn out to be quite complete .",
    "in fact , we show in a companion paper , @xcite , that for a very broad class of stationary processes with a uniquely achieved supremum , our description actually gives all possible distributions of its location . in the present paper",
    "we start with treating a general upper semi - continuous stationary process and ( with one exception ) allowing the process to have multiple supremum locations within an interval .",
    "we proceed with establishing extra conditions the density has to satisfy if the process satisfies certain assumptions . in section  [ secupperbounds ]",
    "we provide the sharpest possible universal upper bounds on the density , both in the general case and in the case of time - reversible stationary processes.=1",

    "even though many of our results do not require it , the most complete description of the distribution of the location of the supremum that we have requires the following , additional , assumption .",
    "[ assl ] @xmath22    it is easy to check that the limit in assumption  [ assl ] exists .",

    "assumption  [ assl ] rules out existence of `` too frequent '' local extrema of the sample paths . for sample continuous processes",
    "this also rules out rapid oscillation of the sample paths possessed , for instance , by the gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck process of example  [ exo - u ] below .",
    "in fact , we will presently see that , at least for sample continuous processes , under assumption  [ assl ] the process has , with probability 1 , sample paths of locally bounded variation .",

    "then , for any @xmath16 , on an event of probability 1 the process has finitely many local maxima and minima in the interval @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , if the process is sample continuous , then its sample paths are , on event of probability 1 , of locally bounded variation .    for notational simplicity",
    "we take @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    "let @xmath28 clearly , the sequence @xmath29 is nondecreasing , and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total number of local maxima of @xmath23 in the interval @xmath32 . by the monotone convergence theorem , @xmath33 therefore , @xmath34 a.s . since between any two distinct local minima",

    "finite as well . since a sample",

    "we start with a result showing existence of a density in the interior of the interval @xmath1 $ ] of the leftmost location of the supremum in that interval for any upper semi - continuous stationary process , as well as conditions this density has to satisfy .",
    "only one of the statements of the theorem requires assumption  [ assu ] , in which case the statement applies to the unique location of the supremum .",
