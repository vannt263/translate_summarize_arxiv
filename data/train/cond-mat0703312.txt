    "many chemical reactions in a condensed phase can be modeled as an escape of a brownian particle from a potential well .",
    "the conventional means for describing this kind of problems are the fokker - planck equations ( fpes ) , or master equations , or the ( generalized ) langevin equations for the reaction coordinate and the conjugated momentum of the particle in the external potential .",
    "since the seminal work of kramers , his approach has further been refined , and the influences of different dissipation ( collision ) mechanisms , @xcite non - poissonian collision statistics , @xcite non - markovian effects , @xcite and position - dependent friction @xcite on the reaction rates have been investigated ( see also reviews @xcite ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the effects due to the velocity dependence of friction .",
    "@xcite our motivation is as follows .",
    "there have been collected evidences in the literature that relaxations of linear and angular velocities and kinetic energies in liquids under ( highly ) non - equilibrium conditions are reproduced neither by conventional fpes with constant frictions nor by master equations with constant collision frequencies , @xcite so that one has to take into account ( linear and/or angular ) velocity dependence of friction .",
    "@xcite indeed , if we consider relaxation under equilibrium conditions , then all the relevant energies are of the order of @xmath12 ( @xmath2 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath3 being the temperature of the bath ) . putting aside non - markovian effects , we can then always introduce a certain effective velocity - independent friction .",
    "this means that the effects due to the velocity dependence of friction are normally small and can safely be neglected . if we consider relaxation under non - equilibrium conditions , when initial energies of the particles are much higher than the typical bath energies @xmath13 , then the velocity dependence of friction can not be ignored , in general .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that similar effects may become relevant in the evaluation of the activated escape rates for underdamped or moderately damped brownian particles .",
    "if an underdamped particle is trapped in a deep potential well ( @xmath14 , see fig .",
    "1 ) then friction is the rate determining parameter : fluctuations must supply the particle with the energy @xmath15 in order to surmount the barrier .",
    "thus , we have to adequately describe the brownian particle relaxation not only within the thermal energy interval @xmath13 but also for much higher energies @xmath16 .",
    "in such a case the constant friction approximation might be an oversimplification , so that the velocity dependence of friction may become crucial .",
    "on the contrary , the effect of the velocity - dependent friction on the the overdamped brownian particle is expected to be minor , since dissipation manifests itself through the diffusion coefficient which equals to the integral relaxation time of the _ equilibrium _ velocity correlation function , which is determined by the typical energies @xmath13 .",
    "the present paper is aimed at proving and elucidating the above qualitative expectations .",
    "all the models studied so far within the framework of the theory of activated rate processes treat dissipation either via the fpe with velocity - independent friction or or via master equations with velocity - independent collision frequency .",
    "@xcite in order to take into account velocity - sensitive dissipation , we must start either from the fpe with velocity - dependent friction @xcite or from master equations with velocity - dependent collision rates .",
    "@xcite to avoid introducing phenomenological dissipation models , we use the rayleigh model of the nonlinear brownian motion , which describes a one - dimensional ( 1d ) relaxation of a heavy particle of mass @xmath4 in the bath of light particles of mass @xmath5 . within this model , collisional relaxation of the heavy particle",
    "is described by the master equation with the velocity - dependent collision frequency .",
    "@xcite the model possesses a small parameter @xmath7 .",
    "then , according to van kampen @xcite , we can run a systematic expansion of this master equation , which allows us to construct the dissipation operator to any desirable order in @xmath17 .",
    "up to the terms of the order of @xmath6 , our starting equation reads @xcite    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the probability density function in the position ( @xmath20 )  velocity ( @xmath21 ) phase space , @xmath22 is an external potential which is schematically depicted in fig . 1 , @xmath23 is the friction , @xmath24 is the number of the bath particles per unit length , @xmath25 the dissipation operator in eq .",
    "( [ fpe0 ] ) consists of two parts .",
    "@xmath26 is the standard fokker - planck operator , while the next - order correction to it is explicitly written as @xmath27    after doing some algebra , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fpe0 ] ) in the following compact form :    @xmath28    here @xmath29 is the core of the dissipation operator , and@xmath30 is the equilibrium boltzmann distribution , and @xmath31 the standard kramers fpe is recovered in the limit @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "( [ fpe ] ) can be solved numerically for any values of parameters ( [ p ] ) . to get a better understanding of the effect of velocity - dependent friction on the escape rates , we analyze the problem analytically .    applying the projector operator technique ,",
    "we can reduce 2d eq .",
    "( [ fpe ] ) to the corresponding 1d equations in the limit of the high ( @xmath34 ) and weak ( @xmath35 ) friction , @xmath36 being a characteristic well frequency . in the former case , the brownian particle s velocity is a fast variable .",
    "we can thus introduce the projection operators @xmath37 and arrive at the smoluchowski diffusion equation for the position - dependent probability density:@xmath38 here the diffusion coefficient , @xmath39 , equals to the integral relaxation time of the equilibrium velocity correlation function in the overdamped limit , @xmath40 . within the present model",
    "this correlation function has been evaluated by hynes , @xcite so that @xmath41 and the kramers rate ( in the limit of low temperature and/or high barrier height , @xmath42 ) reads @xmath43 the frequencies @xmath44 and @xmath45 determine the shape of the potential linearized in the vicinity of the bottom of the well and at the barrier,@xmath46 respectively , see fig .",
    "as expected , the velocity - dependent friction increases the diffusion coefficient , @xcite but the effect is of the order of @xmath10 and is therefore small .",
    "the underdamped limit ( @xmath35 ) is much more interesting .",
    "we can either switch to the action ( @xmath47 )  angle ( @xmath48 ) variables and introduce the projectors @xmath49 or change to the energy variable , @xmath50 . in any case",
    ", we can start from eq .",
    "( [ fpe ] ) and arrive at the energy fpe    @xmath51    the core of the energy fpe operator ( [ fpe ] ) is explicitly written as @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 the equilibrium distribution reads @xmath56 and we have introduced the quantities @xmath57 ( integration is presumed over all @xmath20 for which @xmath58 ) .",
    "the standard kramers energy - diffusion fpe @xcite is recovered in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "( [ fpee ] ) can be used to run perturbative series in @xmath10 to calculate the mean first passage time , @xmath59 , the inverse of which yields the relaxation rate , @xmath60 ( see appendix ) . if we again assume that @xmath42 , we get then @xmath61+o(\\lambda^{4}).\\label{ksmall}\\ ] ] this is the main result of the present paper .",
    "if we neglect the @xmath62 correction , then we recover the kramers expression for the rate in the underdamped limit @xcite @xmath63 on the other hand , the expression in the square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ ksmall ] ) can easily be evaluated . for the harmonic oscillator ( [ ho ] ) , for example , it equals @xmath64 . for the morse oscillator it yields @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the actual small parameter of the problem in the underdamped limit is @xmath66 rather than @xmath10 . since eq .",
    "( [ ksmall ] ) has been derived in the limit @xmath42 , the product @xmath66 can be @xmath67 or higher even for @xmath68 . in this case , evidently , the perturbative expansion of the dissipative operator in @xmath10 may break down , and the description within the rayleigh master equation @xcite might be necessary .",
    "we did not consider the influence of non - markovian effects on the escape rates .",
    "these effects normally reduce molecular friction and therefore decrease the escape rates in the underdamped limit .",
    "their influence is just the opposite to that of the velocity - dependent friction .",
    "however , as has been pointed out in , @xcite the non - markovian effects are of minor importance in the case of a deep well , @xmath42 .",
    "it is in this latter case we predict the velocity dependence of friction can give rise to a dramatic increase of the escape rate , @xmath69 , despite its influence on the velocity relaxation under equilibrium conditions is small , @xmath70 .",
    "the main result of our paper can be formulated as follows : the effects due to the velocity - dependent friction @xcite may be of considerable importance in determining the rate of escape of an under- and moderately damped brownian particle from a deep potential well .",
    "similar effects due to the ( possible ) energy dependence of vibrational relaxation rates might also be significant in describing unimolecular reactions under non - equilibrium conditions , like those investigated in .",
    "@xcite    this work was partially supported by the american chemical society petroleum research fund ( 44481-g6 ) .",
    "the first passage time in the underdamped limit , @xmath59 , can be evaluated through the equation @xcite      obeying the boundary conditions @xmath72 , @xmath73 . the adjoined energy fpe operator , @xmath74 , is explicitly defined via eqs .",
    "( [ de])-([ab ] ) .",
    "@xcite in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ fpee1 ] ) perturbatively , note that @xmath75 possesses contributions both @xmath67 and @xmath62 , while @xmath76 and @xmath77 are both @xmath62 .",
    "thus we get @xmath78 @xmath79 we further assume that the temperature is low , @xmath42 . then , taking into account the explicit form of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we see that the leading contributions stemming from @xmath80 , which are of the order of @xmath81 , cancel each other . thus , @xmath80 yields contributions @xmath82 , which can be neglected as compared with those @xmath83 and @xmath69",
    "then , omitting @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ tau1 ] ) and evaluating integrals to the leading order , we arrive at the expression@xmath84 finally , retaining only the leading contribution @xmath69 into @xmath85 ( [ de0 ] ) and inverting eq .",
    "( [ tau2 ] ) one gets eq . ( [ ksmall ] ) .",
