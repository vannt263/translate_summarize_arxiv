    "we call @xmath28 the _ truncated knot complement_. the idea is to construct a metrically complete convex hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold @xmath29 with the following properties : ( 1 ) @xmath29 has non - empty boundary ; ( 2 ) there is a local isometry @xmath30 from @xmath29 into the knot complement @xmath4 , and thus an injective homomorphism @xmath31 of @xmath32 into @xmath33 ( by lemma [ inj ] ) ; ( 3 ) @xmath29 has a single cusp , @xmath34 , such that + ( i ) the fundamental group of @xmath34 is a free abelian group of rank two , which injects into the fundamental group of @xmath29 under the inclusion map , + ( ii ) the image of @xmath35 under the map @xmath31 is a finite index subgroup of @xmath36 , and + ( iii ) every dehn filling of @xmath29 along the cusp @xmath34 results a compact @xmath1-manifold which is @xmath37-irreducible .",
    "restricting @xmath30 to any boundary component of @xmath29 gives a closed surface in @xmath4 , and the above properties imply that the surface is quasi - fuchsian .",

    "to construct such a manifold @xmath29 , we start with a pair of ( non - compact ) embedded , quasi - fuchsian surfaces @xmath38 , @xmath39 , in @xmath4 such that @xmath40 , @xmath39 , are properly embedded essential surfaces with different boundary slopes on @xmath41 .",
    "the existence of such a pair of surfaces follows from work of culler and shalen @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 be the number of components of @xmath43 and let @xmath44 be the geometric intersection number between a component of @xmath45 and a component of @xmath46 .",
    "the fundamental group of @xmath38 can be naturally identified with a fixed quasi - fuchsian subgroup @xmath47 of @xmath48 .",
    "the limit set @xmath49 of @xmath47 is a jordan circle in @xmath18 .",

    "then each of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a convex @xmath1-submanifold of @xmath10 invariant under the action of @xmath47 .",

    "then @xmath55 is a metrically complete convex hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold with a local isometry @xmath56 into @xmath4 .",

    "we have the corresponding truncated @xmath57-bundle @xmath59 .",
    "the `` cusp region '' of @xmath55 has a standard shape if the geometric cusp @xmath27 of @xmath4 is chosen small enough .",
    "in particular , the parabolic boundary @xmath60 , is a set of @xmath42 standard euclidean annuli .    to illustrate how @xmath29 is constructed ,",
    "let us make some simplifying assumptions .",
    "suppose that each @xmath38 is totally geodesic , that @xmath61 is an @xmath62-neighborhood of @xmath63 , embedded in @xmath4 , and that @xmath64 has a large collar neighborhood in both @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "in this case , we construct @xmath29 as an embedded sub - manifold of @xmath4 .",

    "the boundary of this submanifold is convex , except along the `` corners '' ( @xmath68 ) , and along the truncated cusp .",
    "since we have assumed that the components of @xmath64 are well spread out , there is enough room to smooth out the corners , as illustrated in figure [ intro ] ( which shows the part of the smoothing near @xmath69 ) .",
    "we thus obtain a truncated sub - manifold , @xmath70 , whose frontier is convex .",
    "the complement of @xmath71 in @xmath41 consists of a finite number of disks , and the convex hull of each disk is a compact subset of the cusp @xmath27 .",
    "we scoop out each of these convex sets from @xmath27 to form a new cusp @xmath34 .",
    "the manifold @xmath29 is the union of @xmath72 and @xmath34 .    in general , we can not hope for the manifolds @xmath61 to be embedded in @xmath28 , and so we must construct @xmath29 in a more abstract way .",
    "we wish to identify @xmath73 and @xmath74 along certain isometric embedded submanifolds @xmath75 , which correspond to  intersection \" components of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we then wish to smooth out the corners to form a hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath72 which is local convex everywhere except on its `` parabolic boundary '' @xmath76 .",
    "then we wish to attach a cusp @xmath34 along @xmath76 to form the required manifold @xmath29 .",
    "the gluing and smoothing operations are well - known in the totally geodesic case , but to make them work for quasi - fuchsian surfaces is more difficult .",
    "furthermore , the gluing can only be performed on manifolds with sufficient  room \" .",
    "thus it may be necessary to replace the given manifolds @xmath61 with suitable finite covers @xmath77 .",
    "we construct such covers by proving that free groups satisfy a strengthened form of the lerf property .    in section [ property ] , we collect some general facts about hyperbolic geometry .",
    "of particular importance is a general fact about convex hulls in hyperbolic space ( lemma [ convh ] ) , which is essential for our gluing constructions . in section [ cqf ] ,",
    "we give some general facts about cusped , quasi - fuchsian surfaces , and their convex cores .    in section [ kiyi ]",
    ", we construct the `` gluing manifolds '' @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in the case where each @xmath61 is embedded in @xmath28",
    ", then @xmath80 is just the intersection @xmath81 . in general , the fundamental group of each component of @xmath82 is identified with the intersection of some conjugate of @xmath83 and some conjugate of @xmath84 , and there is an immersion @xmath85 .",
    "the gluing must occur along _ embedded _ sub - manifolds of @xmath61 , and so we must lift @xmath86 to an embedding . for this purpose , it will be useful to isometrically embed @xmath82 into a _",
    "connected _ hyperbolic manifold @xmath87 , whose boundary is convex , outside of a compact set of parabolic regions , and which has a local isometry map ( still denoted @xmath86 ) into @xmath61 .",
    "the construction of @xmath87 is contained in section [ ji ] .",
    "we also wish to control how the parabolic boundary of @xmath87 is located in @xmath88 under the local isometry @xmath89 , and for this purpose we embed @xmath87 isometrically into a certain compact , convex hyperbolic manifold @xmath90 .",
    "we also extend @xmath86 to a local isometry @xmath91 .",
    "the construction of @xmath90 is contained in section [ cni ] .",
    "free groups are lerf , and so , using standard arguments , it is possible to find a finite cover @xmath92 of @xmath55 such that the map @xmath93 lifts to an embedding .",
    "however , for our construction , we require the corresponding truncated cover @xmath94 to have the same number of parabolic boundary components as that of @xmath61 . thus we must show that free groups satisfy a strengthened version of the lerf property .",
    "this is done in section [ csfg ] .",
    "the proof of this stronger lerf property requires much more work than the classical lerf property , and may be of independent group theoretic interest .",
    "the proof applies stallings graph - folding techniques .",
    "finally we need to impose one more technical condition on the covers @xmath92 .",
    "we require that , after the gluing , @xmath95 is isometric to an embedded grid in a certain finite cover @xmath96 of the euclidean torus @xmath97 .",
    "the exterior of the grid should be a set of euclidean parallelograms with long sides .",
    "this requires a further strengthening of the lerf property for free groups , which is carried out in section [ wraps ] .    with this property achieved",
    ", we can cap off @xmath72 with a hollowed solid cusp @xmath34 along @xmath98 to get a metrically complete convex hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold @xmath29 , with non - empty boundary , with a single cusp , and with a local isometry into @xmath4 .",
    "thus @xmath29 already has the required properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) given above . to show @xmath29 has the property ( 3 ) ,",
    "we show that any dehn filling @xmath99 of @xmath29 with slope @xmath100 can be decomposed , in a specified way , into handlebody and @xmath57-bundle pieces .",
    "we call such manifold a @xmath101-manifold . in section [ hsmf ]",
    "we show that if an @xmath101-manifold satisfies certain conditions then its boundary is incompressible .",
    "our last step is to show that the @xmath101-manifold structure of @xmath99 satisfies these conditions for incompressibility .",
    "the final assembly of @xmath29 , and the proof that @xmath29 has all the required properties , are given in section [ pf ] .",
    "we remark that baker and cooper have recently obtained results on gluing convex hyperbolic manifolds ( @xcite ) , which overlap with some of our gluing results , for example in section 4 .",
    "in this paper , all manifolds shall be assumed orientable by default .",
    "any @xmath102-codimension submanifold of an oriented manifold is given the induced orientation in the obvious way .",

    "also @xmath1679 has two components , and so in particular its parabolic boundary has two components on the boundary of the cusp @xmath1680 .",
    "now we just need to show that every dehn filling of @xmath1678 gives a manifold whose boundary is incompressible .",
    "let @xmath1681 be any dehn filling of @xmath1678 along the cusp @xmath1682 with slope @xmath100 .",
    "we give @xmath1683 the obvious @xmath101-manifold structure .",
    "obviously the surface cross interval part of the @xmath101-manifold has no simply connected components ( since taking the double cover does not change this property ) .",
    "the rest of proof is exactly as that of proposition [ last ] since the parabolic boundary of @xmath1684 has at least two components now for each of @xmath39 .",
