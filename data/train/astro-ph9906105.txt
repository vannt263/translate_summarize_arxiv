    "nonuniform plasma outflows seem to be ubiquitous in astrophysics on galactic and extragalactic scales .",
    "the closest example is the solar wind itself which shows strong heliolatitudinal velocity gradients as recently observed by _",
    "ulysses _ ( lima & tsinganos 1996 , mccomas et al .",
    "1998 ) . further away",
    "collimated outflows are observed in association with several galactic objects , such as young and evolved stars , planetary nebulae , x - ray binaries and collapsed objects ( for reviews see ray 1996 , kafatos 1996 , mirabel & rodriguez 1996 , brinkmann & mller 1998 , livio 1998 ) .",
    "finally , on extragalactic scales jets are observed to originate in many active galactic nuclei and quasars ( biretta 1996 , ferrari et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "yet , despite their abundance the basic questions on the formation , acceleration and propagation of nonuniform winds and jets have not been fully answered .",
    "nevertheless , observations seem to indicate that the basic ingredients for producing astrophysical outflows are some sort of heating to launch thermally the wind at the axis plus a rotating central gravitating object and/or an accretion disk threaded with magnetic fields to accelerate magnetocentrifugally and collimate the outflow .",
    "several mechanisms have been investigated for accelerating and collimating astrophysical outflows in galactic and extragalactic scales .",
    "magnetic rotator forces seem to play a rather dominant and crucial role ( lynden - bell 1996 ) but they are probably not the only relevant mechanism .    _ first _ , thermally driven models are based on the _ de laval nozzle _ analogy of the solar wind ( parker 1963 , liffman & siora 1997 ) .",
    "this requires the presence of a hot corona around the central body of the yso or the agn .",
    "x - ray emission detected in several of these objects may imply that thermal effects contribute to the general acceleration mechanism at the base of the flow but they are probably not the only ingredient .",
    "furthermore , if the wind is associated to a very bright object , the flow can be effectively accelerated by the photon flux ( radiatively driven winds , cassinelli 1979 ) .",
    "parallely note also that collimation of bipolar outflows from ysos and planetary nebulae by external thermal pressure gradients have been extensively studied in the frame of the generalized wind blown bubble scenario ( gwbb , frank 1998 ) .",
    "it has demonstrated successfully that magnetic processes may not be the only way to achieve collimated outflows .",
    "_ second _ , magnetic pressure driven models are based on the _ uncoiling spring _ analogy and have been examined by draine ( 1983 ) , uchida & shibata ( 1985 ) and contopoulos ( 1995 ) .",
    "there , it is assumed that a toroidal magnetic field @xmath0 is created and highly amplified by the winding - up of its field lines by a radially collapsing and non - keplerian rotating disk .",
    "plasma is then accelerated from the disk in the poloidal direction by the action of the resulting torsional alfvn waves .",
    "_ third _ , magnetocentrifugally driven outflow models are based on the classical _ bead on a rotating rigid wire _ analogy . there , the magnetized cold fluid is flung out ( even to relativistic velocities ) from the surface of the keplerian accretion disk , provided that the poloidal field lines are inclined enough with respect to the disk axis ( blandford & payne 1982 , pelletier & pudritz 1992 , contopoulos & lovelace 1994 , cao 1997 ) .",
    "this approach is suitable to model winds from accretion disks , but is not valid around the symmetry axis .",
    "moreover it has been pointed out recently ( ogilvie & livio 1998 ) that , even if the lines are sufficiently inclined , a potential barrier still exists that can be overcome only by the presence of an extra source of energy ( e.g. a hot corona ) .    in all the above treatments the effects of the _ combination _ of gas pressure magnetic fields in accelerating , collimating and confining jets",
    "have not been discussed adequately , despite the fact that the role of the gas pressure has been recognized for a long time , i.e. , that jets are not moving in a vacuum ( molecular clouds around yso s , or host galaxies in agn ) and hence they must have some interaction with the external medium ( ferrari et al .",
    "1996 ; frank 1998 ) .",
    "this approach may also highlight the transition from fully thermally driven to fully magnetocentrifugally driven collimated winds .      as with any fully mhd",
    "approach and despite of the simplifications of steadiness and axisymmetric geometry , several approximations are still unavoidable in order to obtain exact solutions useful for an understanding of the mhd mechanism for the initial acceleration and final collimation .",
    "thus , one simple analytical way out is the use of self - similarity .",
    "this hypothesis allows an analysis in a 2-d geometry of the mhd equations which reduce then to a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the basis of the self - similarity treatment is the assumption of a scaling law of one of the variables as function of one of the coordinates . the choice of the scaling variable depends on the specific astrophysical problem .",
    "several models self - similar in the _ radial _ direction have been investigated to analyze the structure of winds from accretion disks ( blandford & payne 1982 , contopoulos & lovelace 1994 , li et al .",
    "1992 , li 1995 , 1996 , ferreira 1997 , ostriker 1997 ) . in these models",
    "the driving force and the collimation derive from a combination of the magnetic and centrifugal forces .",
    "moreover , as disc - winds are associated with jets , these studies usually do not consider under which parametric conditions full collimation is obtained .",
    "exceptions are given in pelletier & pudritz ( 1992 ) and contopoulos & lovelace ( 1994 ) where the collimation efficiency is linked to a current flowing in agreement with the heyvaerts & norman ( 1989 ) general analysis .",
    "however , the absence of an exact crossing of all the existing critical points in the solutions presented in these papers prevents from considering their conclusions as definitive .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that within the frame of self - similar disc - wind assumptions , it is possible to cross all critical points thus getting meaningful solutions ( tsinganos et al .",
    "1996 , vlahakis 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the role of the inhomogeneity in the pressure distribution has not been taken into account until recently in these models ( ferreira 1997 ) and a full parametric study of this extra variable is yet to be performed .      in a series of studies , solutions of the mhd equations that are self - similar in the _ meridional _ direction have been also analyzed ( tsinganos & trussoni 1990 , 1991 , tsinganos & sauty 1992a , b , papers i and ii of this series , trussoni & tsinganos 1993 , sauty & tsinganos 1994 , paper iii of this series , trussoni et al . 1997 , henceforth tts97 ) .",
    "such a treatment allows to study the physical properties of the outflow close to its rotational axis . as in this region",
    "the contribution to acceleration of the magnetocentrifugal forces is small , the effect of a thermal driving force is essential .",
    "this implies also that the structure of the gas pressure in the flow is essential .",
    "two main classes of such self similar solutions have been investigated depending on whether the components of the pressure gradient along the radial and meridional directions are related or not . in the second case",
    "the shape of the streamlines and fieldlines is prescribed ` a priori ' , and the main features of the dynamical variables are self - consistently deduced from the integration . in particular , it has been shown that acceptable solutions for magnetized flows with asymptotic superalfvnic velocity exist only when rotation is included ( tsinganos & trussoni 1991 , trussoni & tsinganos 1993 , tts97 ) . as a consequence of this study",
    "it seems that even pressure confined jets from slow magnetic rotators need magnetic fields and rotation .    in the other case , in which the two components of the gas pressure are related ,",
    "the structure of the streamlines is deduced as a self - consistent solution of the mhd equations .",
    "it has been shown ( papers i and ii ) that hydrodynamical and nonrotating magnetized winds are always radially expanding from the source . on the other hand , rotating magnetized flows with a spherically symmetric structure for the pressure gradient can have final superalfvnic velocities with either radial or collimated asymptotically streamlines , depending on the values of the parameters ( paper iii ) .",
    "this allows to deduce a criterium to select conically expanding winds from cylindrically collimated jets ( sauty et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we extend here the analysis of paper iii to the more general case of solutions for rotating magnetized winds with a _ nonspherically _ symmetric gas pressure . in the present paper we concentrate on the asymptotic analysis and its link to the initial boundary conditions",
    ": this allows us to derive a general criterion for the collimation of winds into jets .",
    "the analysis of the properties of the complete numerical solutions deserves a separate study which is postponed to a following paper .    in sec .",
    "2 we summarize the properties of the meridional self - similar mhd equations while in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the energetic structure of the outflow . in particular we show that an energy integral exists that links the asymptotic regime to the boundary conditions at the base , allowing to formulate a general criterion for the collimation of the wind .",
    "the different physical conditions for asymptotic confinement ( magnetic or thermal ) are discussed in detail in sec . 4 , and in sec .",
    "5 we show that oscillating configurations can be present in cylindrically collimated jets . in sec .",
    "6 the equilibrium asymptotic properties of non collimated flows are outlined , while in sec .",
    "7 we summarize the results and shortly discuss the astrophysical implications of our analysis .",
    "the global dynamical properties of cosmic winds and jets are usually analyzed by assuming that they represent outflows of a fully ionized plasma with a bulk speed @xmath1 and carrying a magnetic field @xmath2 in the gravitational field of a central body of mass @xmath3 .",
    "the familiar mhd equations are employed for a physical description of these phenomena . in particular , under steady and axisymmetric conditions ( @xmath4 ) , the mhd equations are known to admit certain free integrals , i.e. , functions which remain constant on the magnetic surfaces generated by the revolution around the magnetic / flow symmetry axis of the system of a poloidal magnetic line @xmath5 = constant ( tsinganos 1982 ) .",
    "specifically , on the surface of such a flux tube @xmath6 = const .",
    ", the following physical quantities remain invariant throughout the extent of these surfaces from the base to infinity :    * @xmath7(a ) , the ratio of the magnetic and mass fluxes , * @xmath8 , the _ total _ specific angular momentum carried by the flow _ and _ the magnetic field , * @xmath9 , the corotation frequency or angular velocity of each streamline at the base of the flow .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that the poloidal ( @xmath10 ) and azimuthal ( toroidal , @xmath11 ) components of the magnetic field and the velocity can be expressed in terms of these free integrals and the poloidal alfvn mach number , using spherical ( @xmath12 ) or cylindrical ( @xmath13 ) coordinates ( for details see paper iii ) . in particular , the poloidal alfvn mach number ( or alfvn number ) @xmath14 is , @xmath15 on the other hand , the two integrals @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not independent _ if _ the flow is transalfvnic . in such a case , at the cylindrical distance @xmath16 of the alfvn point ( @xmath17 ) from the field / flow axis of a flux tube labeled by @xmath6",
    "they are related as @xmath18 .",
    "a fourth constant of the motion expresses the conservation of energy along streamlines .",
    "thus , by projecting the momentum equation along a streamline , taking into account the first law of thermodynamics for energy conservation , we obtain the generalized classical bernoulli integral ( paper iii ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 is the enthalpy of the perfect monoatomic gas ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is the net local volumetric heating / cooling rate , and @xmath24 the gravitational constant .",
    "thus , at a given radial distance @xmath25 along the streamline labeled by @xmath6 , the conserved energy @xmath26 represents the sum of the kinetic , gravitational , poynting and ideal thermal energy flux densities per unit of mass flux density , minus the extra heat received by the flow between the anchored footpoint at a basal radial distance @xmath27 and the point @xmath25 under consideration , @xmath28 .",
    "the model analysed in this paper belongs to the wide class of meridionally self - similar mhd equilibria ( see also trussoni et al .",
    "1996 ; tsinganos et al . 1996 ; tts97 ; vlahakis & tsinganos 1998 , henceforth vt98 ) . in the following we",
    "briefly summarize the main steps for the construction of such a model ( see appendix a for more technical details ) .    for convenience ,",
    "first of all the variables are normalized to their respective values at the alfvn surface along the axis of rotation , @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , we define the dimensionless radial distance @xmath30 and the alfvn speed @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the poloidal magnetic field , poloidal velocity and density along the polar axis at the characteristic radius @xmath35 . for the magnetic flux function @xmath6",
    "we define its dimensionless form by @xmath36 note that along the polar axis @xmath37 . to obtain the final expressions for the physical variables",
    ", we make the following crucial assumptions :    * _ first _ , we assume that the alfvn surface is _ spherical _ , @xmath38 . then , according to eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) , the density can be expressed as the product of a function of @xmath39 [ i.e. @xmath40 and a function of @xmath41 [ i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , we taylor expand the function @xmath43 to the first order in @xmath41 such that the variation of the density on a spherical surface of given radius @xmath39 is proportional to the magnetic flux @xmath41 . * _ second _ , we assume that the magnetic flux function @xmath41 is expressed as the product of a function of @xmath39 and a function of @xmath44 . furthermore ,",
    "for the function of @xmath44 we take a dipolar dependence with the colatitude @xmath44 .",
    "this immediately implies that the alfvn cross sectional area @xmath45 of a flux surface is proportional to the corresponding magnetic flux @xmath41 .",
    "also , the ratio @xmath46 of the cross sectional area of the flux tube to the alfvn cross sectional area of the same flux tube depends solely on the radial distance @xmath39 . * _ third _ , we assume that the total axial current @xmath47 enclosed by a flux tube @xmath41 = const . is proportional to the corresponding magnetic flux .",
    "this assumption fixes the angular momentum integral @xmath48 ( paper iii ) .",
    "note that at once the integral of the corotation frequency @xmath49 follows from its relation with @xmath48 at the alfvn distance , @xmath50 .",
    "note also that the integrals @xmath48 and @xmath49 are chosen such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 contain only first order @xmath41-terms , in analogy with the previous assumptions . *",
    "_ fourth _ , we assume that the @xmath41-dependence of the gas pressure is similar to that of the density distribution .",
    "this means that the pressure is ultimately a function of the density along a given magnetic surface , a situation analogous to the often used polytropic assumption .",
    "however , this implicit relationship between pressure and density is much more general than the somehow artificial polytropic assumption .",
    "contrary to the polytropic relation , its exact form is not imposed _ a priori _ but",
    "is determined by the full solution .",
    "altogether , the four main assumptions of this meridionally self - similar model can be summarized as follows , @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 the introduced parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 measure the variation with the colatitude of the density , pressure and rotation , respectively .",
    "a fourth parameter @xmath60 enters from the momentum equation as the ratio , at the alfvn distance along the polar axis , of the escape speed to the flow speed there , @xmath61      an important physical quantity in magnetized outflows is the so called _ magnetic rotator energy _",
    "( michel 1969 , belcher & mcgregor 1976 ) , @xmath62 the basal poynting energy @xmath63 , defined as the ratio of the poynting flux density @xmath64 per unit of mass flux density @xmath65 , is roughly equal to the magnetic rotator energy @xmath66 at the base the radius of the jet is much smaller than the alfvn radius ( @xmath67 and the alfvn number there is also negligibly small ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath69    let @xmath70 be the sum of the kinetic , gravitational and thermal energies per unit mass at the base of the outflow .",
    "then the total available energy for the outflow at the base is @xmath71 .",
    "accordingly , we have an outflow from a _ fast magnetic rotator _ ( fmr ) when @xmath72 and an outflow from a _ slow magnetic rotator _ ( smr ) in the opposite case of @xmath73 .      in order to solve the resulting mhd equations ,",
    "it is useful to introduce an extra function @xmath74 ( papers ii and iii ) , @xmath75 evidently , while @xmath76 defined in eq .",
    "( 2.3b ) measures the dimensionless cylindrical radius of a flux tube at the distance @xmath39 , @xmath74 is simply giving the expansion factor of the streamlines . the limiting case @xmath77 corresponds to conical expansion and radial fieldlines , while for @xmath78 we have cylindrical expansion parallel to the axis ( collimation ) . in between these two regimes the flow is paraboloidal .    the above assumptions , eqs . ( 2.3 ) , immediately give the components of the velocity and magnetic fields ( eqs .",
    "a.3 in appendix a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum conservation law in combination with the above assumptions gives four _ ordinary _ differential equations for the four variables @xmath79 , @xmath74 , @xmath80 and @xmath76 ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "the complete solution of these equations , from the base of the outflow to infinity , with the required crossing of all appropriate critical points , is indeed an interesting undertaking and worth of a separate paper . here instead , we shall concentrate on some novel results obtained solely by solving the equations asymptotically far from the alfvn surface ( @xmath81 ) _ and _ taking into account the boundary conditions on the source .",
    "a nonadiabatic flow of a monoatomic gas with ratio of specific heats @xmath82 is always heated at a net volumetric rate @xmath23 @xmath83 with expressions ( 2.3a ) and ( 2.3d ) for the gas density and pressure , it follows immediately that this heating can be written as ( see sec . 5 in paper iii for details of the derivation ) ,",

    "\\eqno(\\hbox{3.3b})\\ ] ] it is worth to digress for a moment and try to get some insight into the physical meaning of these two conserved components of the specific energy , @xmath87 and @xmath97 .      in the first expression ,",
    "( 3.3a ) , the polar energy flux @xmath98 is composed of four terms which are successively the poloidal ( i.e. radial here ) kinetic and gravitational energies , the enthalpy and the heating along the polar axis .",
    "the polar specific energy @xmath87 can be evaluated at both the base of the wind @xmath99 and far from it as @xmath100 , @xmath101 @xmath102 at the base , wherein the kinetic energy of the outflow is negligible , eq .",
    "( 3.4a ) shows that the polar energy has basically two terms : the gravitational energy and the initial input of thermal energy in the form of enthalpy . on the other hand , at infinity , eq .",
    "( 3.4b ) , the conserved polar specific energy is composed of the final kinetic energy along the polar axis and the terminal enthalpy minus the additional extra heating which the flow has received during its propagation from @xmath99 to infinity .    note that if the wind is cylindrically collimated , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 have finite values . in all other cases , @xmath103 and @xmath104 may be unbounded , although their ratio , which is the polar speed in units of the alfvn speed , should remain finite , @xmath106 moreover the terminal pressure @xmath105 vanishes unless the integral of the heating diverges , a rather unphysical situation corresponding to an infinite input of heat .",
    "the conservation of the polar energy simply expresses the fact that the flow along the polar axis is _ thermally driven_. furthermore , from eqs .",
    "( 3.4a , b ) it becomes evident how the conversion of the heat content of the plasma into kinetic and gravitational energy maintains the outflow , @xmath107 @xmath108 in other words , the decrease of the enthalpy at infinity together with the external heat input integrated along the polar streamline , _ on one hand _",
    "lifts the gas out of the gravitational potential well and _ on the other _ , gives to it a finite terminal speed .",
    "of course , this is nothing more than the classical picture of the parker thermally driven wind .",
    "the second conserved component @xmath88 of the specific energy gives the excess or deficit of the volumetric total energy @xmath109 at a nonpolar streamline as compared to the corresponding energy at the polar axis and the same spherical distance , normalized to the volumetric energy of the magnetic rotator .",
    "thus , @xmath88 has five contributions which correspond to the five different terms appearing successively in the rhs of eq .",
    "each one represents the variation  in units of the volumetric energy of the magnetic rotator  between any streamline and the polar axis of ( i ) the poloidal kinetic energy , ( ii ) the volumetric gravitational energy , ( iii ) the azimuthal kinetic energy ( which is zero along the polar axis ) , ( iv ) the poynting flux ( which is also zero along the polar axis ) and ( v ) the thermal content ( enthalpy plus heating ; see appendix b for details ) .    in a more compact way we may write @xmath110 as follows",
    ", @xmath111 evidently , @xmath112 represents the variation across the flow of the total volumetric energy in units of the volumetric energy of the magnetic rotator .",

    "furthermore , @xmath115 can be expressed ( see appendix b for more comments ) in terms of the conditions at the source boundary @xmath99 where the cylindrical radius is @xmath116 , the escape speed @xmath117 , the polar density @xmath118 and the density at any other streamline @xmath119 :    @xmath120   \\over \\delta(\\rho e_{\\rm { mr}})_o } \\ , , \\eqno ( \\hbox{3.7a})\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the variation of the energy of the magnetic rotator , @xmath122 is the variation of the poynting energy , @xmath123 is the variation of the rotational energy at the base , @xmath124 is the variation of the volumetric gravitational energy at the base and @xmath125 is the variation of the volumetric thermal flux at the base , respectively , @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 \\ , , \\eqno ( \\hbox{3.7d})\\ ] ] @xmath129 \\ , , \\eqno ( \\hbox{3.7e})\\ ] ] @xmath130 in this notation , @xmath131 always denotes a variation across the fieldlines at a given radial distance @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath132 for every function @xmath133 .    in eq .",

    "we get that the wavelength is just proportional to the square of the alfvn number , @xmath327 note also that , if the wavelength of the oscillations can be related to the observed morphology of the jets , we may have here an indirect estimate of the magnitude of the poloidal alfvn number .    for overpressured jets ( @xmath164 )",
    ", the behaviour of @xmath317 is similarly following the increase of the alfvn number as the pressure becomes more important , but as it enters the domain of pressure supported jets after the maximum velocity , the oscillations disappear .",
    "in fact in this last case we can see that the pressure gradient supporting the jet can not restore equilibrium against the confining magnetic pinch .",
    "this could imply that the solutions of this class are unstable .",
    "we must notice finally that oscillations in collimated winds are quite a general result , not restricted to our class of meridional self - similar solutions .",

    "this is also in agreement with the fact that the fraction of the heating term converted to kinetic energy and @xmath339 can not diverge ( see sec .",
    "further insight in the general behaviour of the asymptotics can be gained by considering the dominant terms in the transverse momentum equation which gives a relation for the pressure ( see eq .",

    "a _ second _ conclusion is that , _ independently of the value of @xmath139 , underpressured flows ( @xmath189 ) must be cylindrically collimated _ , as found in sec .",
    "this can be explained taking into account that , when the streamlines try to expand , then pinching by both magnetic forces and pressure gradient will dominate over all other forces ( eq .",
    "6.4 ) . to maintain the forces equilibrium a strong bending of the lines towards the axis",
    "is required , @xmath341 , such that the system must relax towards a collimated configuration .",
    "then only overpressured outflows ( @xmath164 ) may be non collimated .",
    "assuming @xmath342 , we discuss separately the case of paraboloidal ( @xmath343 ) and radial asymptotics ( @xmath344 ) .      independently on the value of @xmath332 ,",
    "( 6.3 ) further simplifies as follows @xmath345 which implies that _ paraboloidal shapes can exist only for @xmath162_. in other words , only overpressured outflows from an efficient magnetic rotator may eventually achieve a paraboloidal shape .",
    "this can be physically understood because such a structure implies some collimation that can be achieved only through magnetic forces in the present case .",
    "we remark that in the case @xmath346 eq .",
    "( 6.5 ) can be fulfilled only for diverging asymptotic velocity ( paper iii ) . however , as we have seen before , such a case would require an infinite heating rate , so that such kind of solutions should be considered as unphysical .      if @xmath347 , eq .",
    "( 6.5 ) and the previous remarks still hold . for @xmath348 , eq . ( 6.3 ) becomes @xmath349 and radial asymptotics can exist _ a priori _ for both negative and positive values of @xmath139 .",
    "this simple analysis shows that overpressured flows ( @xmath164 ) can attain only radial streamlines if they are imr ( @xmath163 ) , while they can have cylindrical , paraboloidal or radial asymptotics if they are associated with an emr ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "we point out finally a common feature for winds with parabolic or radial asymptotics . from eq .",
    "( 6.4 ) we see that temperature goes to a constant value along each fieldline @xmath350 i.e. all uncollimated solutions are isothermal asymptotically .",
    "this is consistent with the results of tsinganos & trussoni ( 1991 ) , who analyzed solutions with prescribed radial streamlines [ @xmath77 ] .",
    "more in general , we can expect that in non collimated outflows some heating is always necessary in the asymptotic regions .",
    "conversely in a cylindrical jet , where the pressure and density are constant , the temperature is also constant but the heating rate in the flow vanishes ( eq . 3.1b , c ) .",
    "we have presented here the asymptotic properties of superalfvnic outflows which are self - similar in the meridional direction .",
    "the terminal alfvn number , @xmath103 , the dimensionless asymptotic radius of the jet , @xmath104 and velocity , @xmath208 depend only on three parameters ( see eqs . 4.4 ) . besides the terminal pressure @xmath105 ,",
    "the two other crucial parameters are :    @xmath352 , connecting the radial and longitudinal components of the gradient of the gas pressure .",
    "thus , the outflow can be either overpressured ( @xmath146 ) , or underpressured ( @xmath238 ) with respect to the rotational axis .",
    "@xmath352 , which measures the magnetic contribution to the collimation of the outflow .",
    "thus , we may divide the sources of outflows into two broad classes : _ efficient magnetic rotators _ ( emr ) corresponding to positive values of @xmath139 and a strong magnetic contribution to collimation , and _ inefficient magnetic rotators _ ( imr ) which have negative @xmath139 and can collimate outflows only with the help of the gas pressure . is very small .",
    "however in such jets the gas pressure plays a crucial role in the achievement of the final collimation through strong pinching gradients in the intermediate region between the base and infinity . ]    the absolute criterion for cylindrical collimation is given by the sign of a combination of the two parameters @xmath206 and @xmath209 .",
    "this new parameter    @xmath352 is related to the variation across the streamlines of the various energy contributions which govern the flow dynamics ( magnetocentrifugal , thermal , etc ) .",
    "thus , a positive value of @xmath174 provides cylindrical asymptotics while negative values are required for having uncollimated flows .    despite this simple criterion",
    ", the asymptotic behaviour of the outflow still depends on the value of each parameter taken separately as shown in fig .",
    "9 [ see also figs .",
    "( 13 ) ] .    @xmath352 . for @xmath353",
    "the wind always obtains cylindrical asymptotics .",
    "the jet is supported by the centrifugal force , while collimation can be provided either by the magnetic pinching or the gas pressure , depending on @xmath139 and the value of the asymptotic gas pressure @xmath268 .",
    "we repeat however that for imr the state of asymptotic magnetic confinement can be achieved only through the strong pressure gradients occurring between the base of the flow and infinity .",
    "if @xmath268 does not vanish , the jet radius has a maximum when moving from the magnetic to the thermal regime ( by reducing @xmath354 ) .",
    "when @xmath342 the jet can be confined by the magnetic pinch only , and is supported either by the centrifugal force or by the thermal pressure gradient . if @xmath268 does not vanish , the jet terminal velocity has a maximum when moving from the centrifugal to the thermal regime .",
    "moreover , in overpressured outflows , cylindrical configurations are attained only for values of @xmath355 higher than some threshold depending on the pressure parameters , @xmath268 and @xmath58 . below this positive threshold value",
    "the outflow reaches conical or paraboloidal asymptotics if @xmath162 ( emr ) or only purely conical asymptotics if @xmath163 ( imr ) .",
    "cylindrical collimation seems to be quite a natural end state for superalfvnic outflows with non vanishing asymptotic pressure , as also found by other studies based on the radial self - similar approach ( li 1995 , 1996 , ferreira 1997 , ostriker 1997 ) , or on the full asymptotic treatment of the mhd equations ( heyvaerts & norman 1989 ) .",
    "however in the present case the collimation can be provided not only by the magnetic pinch , but also by the thermal pressure gradient .",
    "this is consistent with our self - similar scenario , suitable to model winds close to their rotational axis , where the thermal effects are essential to drive the outflow .",
    "we also point out that our results are consistent with those of tts97 , where again different collimation regimes can be found .",
    "finally , we remark that cylindrically collimated streamlines most of times undergo oscillations with different wavelengths .      as in paper iii and tts97",
    ", the present results could be particularly suitable to model the physical properties of collimated outflows associated with young stellar objects ( yso ) .",
    "however , since here we have analyzed only the asymptotic properties of winds , we will shortly discuss only a simple possible scenario based on the physical difference between emr and imr .",
    "let us consider a rapidly rotating magnetized protostar at the beginning of its evolution .",
    "in such conditions this object could be considered as an emr , with a well collimated , magnetically confined jet . at the same time the pressure inhomogeneity @xmath356 and the asymptotic pressure may take rather high values due to the inhomogeneous and anisotropic environment in which the jet is found . in the early phases of stellar evolution",
    "the outflow extracts quite efficiently angular momentum from the protostar , reducing its spinning rate . from the point of view of our model",
    "this means that the system moves from the state of an emr to that of an imr as it lowers the value of @xmath139 .",
    "of course the details of the evolution may be more complicated due to the feeding of the wind by the surrounding accretion disk .",
    "nevertheless the net end result should be a decrease of the spinning rate and subsequently of the efficiency of the magnetic rotator ( bouvier et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "if the jet is initially underpressured , for example being embedded in a dense molecular cloud , as it approaches the regime of the imr a gradual widening of its radius is expected .",
    "this widening may reach a maximum value , wherein the magnetic and thermal contributions to the confinement are comparable . at this stage it is reasonable to expect a decrease of the asymptotic pressure because of this widening . at the same time",
    ", we may have a more homogeneous flow , i.e. , effectively a decrease of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , in the subsequent evolution of the central young star , we expect that the jet continues increasing its radius .",
    "according to this scenario , we can imagine an evolutionary track of the outflow along the maxima from figs .",
    "1d to fig . 1b , wherein there is an equal contribution by the thermal and magnetic forces confining the plasma . in this sequence , the terminal velocity always increases , figs .",
    "3d to 3b , as @xmath58 and the asymptotic pressure @xmath105 get lower and lower values . finally , the outflow becomes a loosely collimated wind .    in the above scenario ,",
    "it is essential to have a decrease of @xmath58 and @xmath105 during the evolution . because , otherwise , we see that an imr ( @xmath163 ) together with a strongly underpressured plasma ( high @xmath357 ) have the result to over collimate the wind with an asymptotic radius comparable to its alfvn radius",
    ". this result would be somehow in contradiction with the observed radii of outflows from ysos which are expected to be much larger than the alfvn radius .",
    "instead , we propose that both thermal and magnetic confinement decrease simultaneously during the evolution of the central source .",
    "however , jets from planetary nebulae ( pn ) may present a totally different situation where the primary source of confinement is a strong pressure gradient , @xmath358 , associated with a source which is a very inefficient magnetic rotator , although with a non zero magnetic field .",
    "the terminal radii of jets from pn are indeed observed to be rather small after some huge initial widening ( frank 1998 ) .",
    "we also note that our analysis favours a hydrodynamical origin of jets from pn similarly to the gwbb model ( cf .",
    "mellema & frank 1997 , frank 1998 ) and contrarily to a pure magnetic origin of the refocusing of the wind .",
    "the analysis of overpressured jets is more complex at first glance as different regimes are possible for the same @xmath139 .",
    "let us first consider that the jet is initially quite narrow , centrifugally supported and originates from an emr ; i.e. , it is on the lower branches of the thin grey lines ( @xmath164 ) of figs .",
    "13 . as in the previous case",
    ", the rotation slows down ( @xmath139 decreases ) , the outflow rapidly opens and the velocity rises .",
    "however , below a threshold value of @xmath354 the flow becomes uncollimated ( see fig .",
    "if , conversely , at the beginning the jet is pressure supported ( i.e. , on the upper branches of the dotted lines in figs .",
    "1b  d , 2b  d ) , the behaviour is quite ambiguous : a reduction or an increase of the jet radius and velocity critically depends on the initial conditions ( @xmath356 , asymptotic pressure , jet radius ) when the star starts slowing down its rotational rate .",
    "then it is difficult to model the possible evolution of a pressure supported jet .",
    "but , as we said previously , the absence of oscillations in this region may indicate that such equilibria are in fact unstable and never attained practically .",
    "it is evident from the above that the possible outflow evolution is critically related to its physical conditions , namely if it is underpressured or overpressured .",
    "in which of these regimes the outflow can be found depends on the detailed history of the wind .",
    "we remind that the thermodynamic conditions across the jet in its asymptotic regime depend also on the assumed structure of density ( @xmath57 ) and the intensity of the gravitational field ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these two parameters do not enter in the present analysis , but are essential for the thermal acceleration of the wind ( see paper iii and tts97 ) .",
    "therefore the next step in the present analysis is to make a careful parametric study of the numerical solutions , solving the set of eqs .",
    "this is also demanded in order to make a detailed comparison with observational data and implies that we construct solutions that connect the base of the flow with the superalfvnic region fulfilling the regularity conditions at the critical points ( sauty et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". in particular , it will be crucial to see whether or not all the asymptotic regimes presented here can be attained .",
    "the present results have been obtained in the framework of a self - similar treatment of the axisymmetric mhd equations .",
    "this implies some ` a priori ' constraints on the structure of the solutions , that we summarize in the following .    the surfaces with the same alfvnic number are spherical [ @xmath359 , with the velocity vanishing on the equatorial plane .",
    "furthermore the @xmath360 and @xmath361 components of the gradient of the gas pressure are linearly related .",
    "these assumptions are not too constraining if we consider our model as suitable to describe the physical properties of the flow around the rotational axis .",
    "we remind also that our results are consistent with those found in tts97 , where the two components of @xmath362 were unrelated in a wind with prescribed cylindrical asymptotics",
    ".    such limits of the present treatment could anyway be overcome by a different scaling of the physical variables with the colatitude .",
    "it has been shown in vt98 that the assumptions of eqs .",
    "( 2.3 ) are just a particular case of a more general class of solutions , with no vanishing velocity on the equator and with a more complex expression for the pressure ( another particular case is the one studied in lima et al . 1996 ; see also vlahakis 1998 ) . in such a case",
    "the set of the mhd equations lead to a closed system whose treatment does not require any further ` a priori ' assumption as the relation between the components of the pressure gradient ( as in paper iii and in the present study ) or the prescription of the streamline shape ( as in tt97 ) .    finally , we point out once more that , contrary to the radial self - similar studies , the role of the thermal structure of the flow , which is related to the details of processes of input / output of heating in the gas , is essential in our model and not only in accelerating the flow but also in constructing its global shape .",

    "<S> an axisymmetric mhd model is examined analytically to illustrate some key aspects of the physics of hot and magnetized outflows which originate in the near environment of a central gravitating body . by analyzing the asymptotical behaviour of the outflows it is found that they attain a variety of shapes such as conical , paraboloidal or cylindrical . </S>",
    "<S> however , non cylindrical asymptotics can be achieved only when the magnetic pinching is negligible and the outflow is overpressured on its symmetry axis . in cylindrical jet - type asymptotics , the outflowing plasma reaches an equilibrium wherein it is confined by magnetic forces or gas pressure gradients , while it is supported by centrifugal forces or gas pressure gradients . </S>",
    "<S> in which of the two regimes ( with thermal or magnetic confinement ) a jet can be found depends on the efficiency of the central magnetic rotator . the radius and terminal speed of the jet </S>",
    "<S> are analytically given in terms of the variation across the poloidal streamlines of the total energy . </S>",
    "<S> large radius of the jet and efficient acceleration are best obtained when the external confinement is provided with comparable contributions by magnetic pinching and thermal pressure . in most cases , </S>",
    "<S> collimated streamlines undergo oscillations with various wavelengths , as also found by other analytical models . </S>",
    "<S> scenarios for the evolution of outflows into winds and jets in the different confinement regimes are shortly outlined .    </S>",
