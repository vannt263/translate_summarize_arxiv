    "to which extent a single neuron can influence brain circuits / networks dynamics ?",
    "why only a few neurons display such a strong power ?",
    "these open questions are inspired by recent experimental observations in developing and adult neuronal circuits , as well as by classical debates within the framework of the single neuron doctrine . in this work",
    "we identify and present a mechanism which can explain in neuronal circuits , at some early stage of their development , how and why only a few specific neurons can exhibit such power . for this purpose , we consider a standard neuronal network model whose population activity is characterized by bursting behavior .",
    "the introduction of a distribution of correlated neuronal excitabilities and degrees , inspired by the simultaneous presence of younger and older neurons in the network , leads to the emergence of functional hub neurons .",
    "these critical cells , whenever perturbed , are capable of suppressing network synchronization .",
    "notably , we show that their strong influence on the population dynamics is not related to their structural properties , but to their operational and structural integration into a clique .",
    "these results highlight how network-wide effects can be induced by single neurons without any need for a specific topological architecture .",
    "there is increasing experimental evidence that single neuron firing can impact brain circuits dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a single pyramidal cell can trigger whisker deflection @xcite , drive sensory perception @xcite and modify brain states @xcite .",
    "similarly , a single gabaergic hub cell can affect collective activity within the developing hippocampal circuitries @xcite .",
    "in vivo cortical studies have shown that a single extra action potential ( ap ) can generate a few dozens extra spikes in its postsynaptic targets  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a burst of aps , evoked in a pyramidal cell , can propagate through the network activating locally a high fraction of somatostatine gabaergic cells ( a subset of inhibitory neurons ) and a few excitatory cells  @xcite .",
    "the capability of single neurons to evoke sparse  @xcite and network - wide neuronal events @xcite in brain circuits can be interpreted within the framework of the single neuron doctrine , firstly postulated on sensorial perception by barlow in 1972  @xcite . according to this doctrine , the spiking of a single neuron in a network has a high functional relevance being able to code very specifically for high level features of abstraction such as concepts .",
    "face selective cells  @xcite are a typical example of sparse object representation in the brain and of putative  grandmother  cells  @xcite . the sensitivity of neuronal networks to small perturbations , such as those introduced by the firing of a single cell , can also find an explanation within the self - organized criticality ( soc ) framework  @xcite . in the last decade",
    ", soc has widely been proposed as the mechanism underlying power law distributions , with characteristic exponents , featuring the size and duration of population events .",
    "these distributions have been measured in - vivo and in - vitro experiments on neuronal networks from invertebrates , rodents , monkeys and humans  @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis underlying the soc interpretation is that neuronal networks self - organize into a critical state where responses , over temporal and spatial scales of any size ( the so - called `` avalanches '' ) , can be triggered by small perturbations . despite the theoretical frameworks above introduced ,",
    "one of the main open question is how and why only specific neurons can affect the global network dynamics as observed in  @xcite .",
    "two main approaches can be foreseen : a `` structural - functional '' approach  @xcite , where the specific topology of the network and the connectivity pattern of the cells are responsible for the relevance of the single neuron or a `` dynamical '' approach , where the single neuron becomes relevant due to the nonlinear evolution of neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity in the network  @xcite .",
    "a recent computational study on the synchronization properties of a specific neural circuit  @xcite , has pointed out that the level of burst synchrony is a function of both the network topology and the intrinsic dynamics of peculiar neurons , which have a central location in the network graph .",
    "this led the authors to conclude that in realistic neuronal systems the choice of a specific topology is not sufficient to induce an unequivocal dynamical behavior in network activity . to further deepen the comprehension of the interplay among cell excitability and synaptic connectivity in promoting network burst synchrony , in this paper we study the effect of single neurons perturbations on the collective dynamics of a network of leaky - integrate - and - fire neurons with short - term synaptic - plasticity  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of these network models for neuroscience have been demonstrated in many contexts ranging from the modelization of working memory  @xcite to the possibility to perform computation by ensemble synchronization  @xcite .",
    "although these models have extensively been studied for their capability to generate spontaneous population bursting , little is known about the influence of single cell perturbations on their global dynamics  @xcite .    in order to analyze the population dynamics in a neural circuit at the initial stage of its development , when both mature and young cells are simultaneously present , we consider a random diluted network presenting developmentally inspired correlations between neuronal excitability and connectivity .",
    "the presence of these correlations can render the network sensitive to single neuron perturbation of a few peculiar neurons .",
    "the coherent activity of the network can be even arrested by removing or stimulating any of these neurons , which are functional hubs arranged in a _",
    "clique _ regulating the neuronal bursting .",
    "we show that the level of available synaptic resources influences the reciprocal firing times of the synaptically connected neurons of the clique .",
    "however , the fundamental mechanism responsible for the burst triggering relies on an unsupervised process leading to a precise firing sequence between the neurons which are not structurally connected .",
    "furthermore , frequency locking of the same neurons led , counter - intuitively , to anti - resonances  @xcite , inducing reduced bursting activity or even complete silence in the circuit .",
    "notably , although obtained in a developmentally regulated framework , these results can also be extended to a more general context where the effective connectivity and excitability of the neurons are dynamically regulated by the different states of brain processing .",
    "in this paper we intend to mimic an immature neuronal network _ frozen _ at a certain stage of its initial development , similar to the one examined in the experimental work on developmental hippocampal circuits  @xcite which inspired this work . at early postnatal stages ,",
    "the main features characterizing such networks are the excitatory action of gabaergic transmission ( which is instead the most common inhibitory source in mature circuits ) and the presence of synchronized network events , as largely documented in central and peripheral nervous circuits @xcite . according to that ,",
    "we consider a network model composed of only excitatory neurons and displaying bursting activity .    in particular , we considered a directed random network made of @xmath0 leaky - integrate - and - fire ( lif ) neurons  @xcite interacting via excitatory synapses and regulated by short - term - synaptic - plasticity ( see methods for more details ) , similarly to the model introduced by tsodyks - uziel - markram ( tum ) @xcite .",
    "as previously shown in @xcite , these networks exhibit a dynamical behavior characterized by an alternance of short periods of quasi - synchronous firing ( _ population bursts _ , pbs ) and long time intervals of asynchronous firing .",
    "notably , the presence of short - term - synaptic - plasticity is the crucial ingredient to observe pbs , even without an inhibitory population  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the tum model with excitatory synapses can be considered as a minimal model to mimic the experimentally described stereotypical / characteristic condition of developing neuronal networks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in developing networks , both mature and young neurons are present at the same time , and this feature is reflected in the variability of the structural connectivities and of the intrinsic excitabilities .",
    "experimental observations indicate that younger cells have a more pronounced excitability  @xcite , while mature cells exhibit a higher number of synaptic inputs  @xcite . thus suggesting that the number of afferent and efferent synaptic connections  @xcite as well as their level of hyperpolarization  @xcite are positively correlated with the maturation stage of the cells .",
    "the gradient of excitability - with younger neurons more excitable than older ones - could be explained by a gradient in the excitatory action of gabaergic transmission , i.e. older neurons receive a less depolarizing action by gabaergic input  @xcite .    the presence at the same time of younger and older neurons can be modeled by considering correlations among the in - degree and out - degree of each cell as well as among their intrinsic excitability and connectivity . in particular , in the attempt to find the network organization which is more sensitive to single neuron perturbations",
    ", we compare the dynamics of networks where none , one or more of the following correlations have been embedded ( for more details see methods and supplementary information ) :    * setup t1 : positive correlation between the in - degree and out - degree of each neuron ; * setup t2 : negative correlation between the intrinsic neuronal excitability and the total connectivity ( in - degree plus out - degree ) ; * setup t3 : positive correlation between the intrinsic neuronal excitability and the total connectivity ( in - degree plus out - degree ) .    correlated networks with all possible combinations of the setups",
    "t1-t3 have been examined . however , the paper is mainly devoted to the comparison of the properties of the network with correlations of type t1 and t2 ( as displayed in fig .",
    "s1 ) with the completely uncorrelated one , which is a directed erds - rnyi graph ( see figs .",
    "s3a , s3b ) .",
    "in order to test the possible influence of hub neurons on the network dynamics , also few structural hubs have been added to the network whenever correlations of type t1 were embedded ( see methods and fig .",
    "s1 for more details ) .",
    "it is important to stress that correlations of type t1 and t2 have a justification on the fact that we consider networks at their developmental stage , as explained above .",
    "furthermore , the correlation of type t2 can also represent a homeostatic regulation of the neuronal firing to cope with different levels of synaptic inputs  @xcite .    for clarity reasons , the paper will mainly deal with a specific realization of a network , made of @xmath1 neurons and embedding correlations of type t1 and t2 .",
    "however , we have verified the validity of our findings in other five realizations of the network with correlations t1 and t2 : four for @xmath1 ( examined in text s2 ) and one corresponding to @xmath2 ( discussed in details in text s3 ) .      in the developing hippocampus it has been shown how the stimulation of specific single neurons can drastically reduce the frequency of the pbs @xcite .",
    "these neurons have been identified as _ hub cells _ for their high degree of functional , effective , and structural connectivity  @xcite .",
    "stimulation consisted of phasic or tonic current injection capable of inducing sustained high firing regime of the stimulated neuron over a period of a few minutes .",
    "based on this experimental observations , we tested the impact of prolonged _ single neuron stimulation _",
    "( sns ) on the occurrence of pbs on our network model .",
    "sns was obtained by adding abruptly a dc current term to the considered neuron . for illustrative purpose ,",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi ] a - b the stimulation protocol for a specific neuron capable of suppressing the occurrence of pbs for all the duration of the sns ( in this case limited to @xmath3 s ) . during the current stimulation",
    "the neuron fired with a frequency of @xmath4 hz well above the average ( @xmath5 hz ) and the maximal ( @xmath6 hz ) firing rate of the neurons in the network under control conditions ( see the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi ] c ) .",
    "the stimulation process was completely reversible and after the end of the sns both the firing rate of the cell and the pbs frequency returned to the pre - stimulation control level . in order to evaluate the impact of single neuron perturbation on the collective dynamics",
    ", we considered the variation of pb frequency relative to control conditions ( i.e. in absence of any stimulation ) . in figs .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi ] c , d the impact of a single neuron stimulation on the pbs frequency is reported for a classical erds - rnyi network ( no correlations ) and a network with embedded correlations t1 plus t2 .",
    "please notice that the neurons in figs .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi]c - d are ordered according to their average firing rate @xmath7 under control conditions , which covered the interval @xmath8 $ ] hz .",
    "the comparison of panels c and d in fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi ] clearly shows that the correlated network is much more sensitive to single neuron stimulation .",
    "in fact , the sns was able , for three neurons , to suppress the occurrence of pbs during their stimulation , while for approximately another half dozen of neurons the pbs were halved with respect to control conditions .",
    "the three most critical neurons @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 were characterized , before stimulation , by firing frequencies larger than @xmath12 hz , and they lay among the top @xmath13% fastest spiking neurons . on the contrary , in a network where no correlations were present , the sns had only extremely marginal influence on the population activity ( see fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi]d ) , although the firing rate distributions in the correlated and uncorrelated network were extremely similar ( under control conditions ) as shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi ] c and d.    in @xcite it was shown that the elimination of a pool of neurons from an uncorrelated network encompassing short - term synaptic plasticity caused a strong reduction of the population bursts . in this work we repeated such numerical experiment with single cell resolution ,",
    "i.e. we considered the influence of _ single neuron deletion _ , snd , on the neuronal response of the network ( results reported in fig .",
    "[ tumexperiment ] ) . for the network with correlations @xmath14 plus @xmath15 , in four cases the snd led to the complete disappearance of pbs within the examined time interval , while for five other neurons their individual removal led to a decrease of the order of @xmath16 in the frequency of occurrence of the pbs ( fig .",
    "[ tumexperiment ] a ) .",
    "three among these four critical neurons ( namely , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) were also responsible for silencing the network during the sns experiment performed with a stimulation current @xmath17 mv , as shown in fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi]c and fig . [ tumexperiment ] a. the same sns experiment on the fourth critical neuron , labeled @xmath18 , reduced the pb frequency of about 40% with respect to control conditions ( fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi]c ) .",
    "however , as we will show in the following , a sns experiment performed on @xmath18 with a different injected current can also lead to a complete silence in the network .",
    "notably , in analogy with the sns , also this additional critical neuron @xmath19 impacting the pb occurrence under snd lays among the top 33% fastest spiking neurons .",
    "differently from sns , the removal of neurons with lower frequencies had almost no impact on the network dynamics .",
    "for uncorrelated networks the effect of snd was almost negligible , inducing a maximal variation in the bursting activity of the order of 10 - 15 % with respect to the activity under control conditions ( see fig .",
    "s3c ) .",
    "we have also analyzed the response to sns and snd experiments in networks embedding all the possible combinations of the correlations setups t1-t3 .",
    "in particular , we considered networks with positive correlation between structural in - degree ( @xmath20 ) and out - degree ( @xmath21 ) ( setup t1 shown in figs .",
    "s4a , s4b ) , with negative correlation between excitability @xmath22 and total connectivity @xmath23 ( setup t2 shown in figs .",
    "s5a , s5b ) , with only positive correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath24 ( setup t3 shown in figs .",
    "s6a , s6b ) and finally combining positive correlations between @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath24 ( setups t1 plus t3 shown in figs .",
    "s7a , s7b ) .",
    "as we are looking for strong impacts on the network dynamics , we identified the network as `` sensitive '' to snd ( or sns ) whenever the pbs frequency was altered more than 90% with respect to the corresponding pb activity in control conditions .",
    "therefore , we considered as significative only the modifications of the activity which were well beyond the statistical fluctuations in the population bursting , shown by the shaded gray area in panels c and d in figs .",
    "s4 , s5 , s6 , and s7 .    in all the examined cases , despite the fact that the firing frequencies distributions were quite similar to the ones measured in the correlated network embedding setups t1 and t2 , we did not observe significant modifications of the bursting activity by performing sns and snd experiments on any neuron of the network ( see panels c and d in figs .",
    "s4,s5,s6,s7 ) .",
    "the situation where sns and snd had a larger effect on the network activity was for the correlations of type t2 . in that specific case we observed that snd on 2 neurons ( lying among the top 33% fastest spiking neurons , namely @xmath25 hz ) halved the bursting frequency of the network , and sns on one of these 2 neurons had a similar effect . in all the other cases the pb activity was never perturbed more than 20 - 30 % . only the simultaneous presence of type t1 and type t2 correlations noticeably enhanced the sensitivity to sns and snd , leading to the possibility to silence the network .      in order to gain some insight into the mechanisms underlying the reported response of the network , with correlations of type @xmath14 plus @xmath15 , to sns and snd experiments",
    ", we analyzed the structural and functional connectivity of the network in relation to the intrinsic excitability of the neurons .",
    "functional connectivity ( fc ) analysis  @xcite was aimed at revealing time - lagged firing correlations between neuronal pairs , similarly to what described in  @xcite for the developing hippocampus . in particular , for every possible pairs of neurons @xmath26 we cross - correlated their spike time series , with the exclusion of the spikes occurring within bursts , for which only the timestamp of the first spike was kept ( see methods ) .",
    "a functional connection directed from @xmath27 to @xmath28 was established whenever the activation of @xmath27 reliably preceded the activation of @xmath28 and viceversa ( see methods ) .",
    "for each cell @xmath27 , we calculated the functional out - degree ( in - degree ) @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , i.e. the number of cells which were reliably activated after ( before ) its firing .",
    "as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ tumexperiment]b , the four critical neurons , @xmath18@xmath11 , identified during the sns and snd experiments , have very high functional out - degree , namely @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , three of them ( @xmath18 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are ranked among the first four neurons with the highest functional out - degree .",
    "therefore the critical neurons are reliably preceding the activation of most of the other neurons in the network .",
    "in addition , neurons @xmath18 and @xmath10 were supra - threshold ( @xmath32 , see methods ) and therefore firing tonically even if isolated from the network , while neuron @xmath9 was at threshold and @xmath11 below it ( as shown in the central panel of fig .  [ tumexperiment]b ) .",
    "in contrast to their high functional out - degree , critical neurons were characterized by a low structural degree @xmath23 ( total number of afferent and efferent connections ) , namely @xmath33 with respect to an average value @xmath34 , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ tumexperiment]b .",
    "this result was a direct consequence of the anti - correlation imposed between total degree and excitability and this represented a crucial aspect for the emergence of the critical neurons .    in fig .",
    "[ tumexperiment ] c we report the results of sns ( snd ) experiments as a function of @xmath35 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the stimulated ( removed ) neurons . the experiments on the neurons with high @xmath24 ( the structural hubs , shown in fig .",
    "s1 a and s1 b ) influenced marginally the network bursting , apart for the single neuron stimulation of the two principal hubs which led to a moderate increase of the activity ( see the bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ tumexperiment ] c ) .",
    "however snd on the same neurons had no significant effect .",
    "on the other hand , neurons with high functional out - degree @xmath35 ( functional hubs ) were quite relevant to sustain the collective dynamics .",
    "the removal of neurons with low @xmath35 ( including the structural hubs ) seemed almost not affecting the bursting properties of the network .",
    "altogether , apart the stressed differences , the sns and snd experiments appeared to give quite similar results .",
    "the generality of these findings have been tested by performing sns / snd experiments on other five different realizations of the network with embedded correlations of type t1 and t2 , in all cases a small subset of neurons resulted to be critical in the sense discussed above ( for more details see text s2 and s3 ) .      in order to further clarify the impact of varying the intrinsic excitability of single neurons on the network bursting activity",
    ", we have performed extensive analysis of the network response under sns experiments for a wide range of stimulation currents , namely @xmath36 $ ] mv . in panels a and b of fig .",
    "[ impatto_di_a_suicritici ] it is summarized the impact on the bursting activity of the sns for networks with type t1 and t2 correlations and without any correlations .",
    "sns had really a minimal effect on the uncorrelated network : in this case the number of emitted pbs varied only up to a 20 % with respect to control conditions . on the contrary , for the correlated network , sns was able to silence the network over a wide range of currents when @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 were stimulated . for the other neurons , sns with high stimulation currents could also have the effect of promoting an increase of pbs up to 130 - 140 % with respect to control conditions .",
    "in particular , an increase in the pb activity has been observed consistently for two structural hubs , whenever they are brought above the firing threshold , as shown in fig .",
    "s1 c , and for other two neurons directly connected to these hubs .",
    "this behaviour is expected for an excitatory network without correlations , where the neurons with higher out - degree have usually the highest impact on the network  @xcite .",
    "however , the removal of each of these four neurons from the network did not influence the pb activity , furthermore they were passively recruited during bursting events.these results had an explanation in the fact that in control conditions the structural hubs were well below threshold , due to the anti - correlation between total degree and excitability , while by increasing the stimulation on these hubs we violated such constraint .    as shown in panels",
    "d , e , f of fig .  [ impatto_di_a_suicritici ] , for neurons @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the bursting activity survived only in narrow stimulation windows located around , or just above the firing threshold value .",
    "a current variation @xmath37 mv was , for these three neurons , sufficient to silence the network .",
    "the stimulation of the neuron @xmath18 , the one critical for snd but not for sns ( when @xmath38 mv ) , revealed the existence of very narrow _ anti - resonance _ windows ( i.e. minima in the number of emitted pbs ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ impatto_di_a_suicritici ] c. for very specific intrinsic excitability this neuron could effectively silence the network , but for generic excitation its influence on pbs activity was limited .",
    "the anti - resonances occurred ( for @xmath39 mv ) at almost regular intervals : initially of width @xmath40 mv and , at larger intrinsic excitability , of width @xmath41 mv .",
    "this point will be further discussed and clarified in sect .",
    "_ time orchestration_.      the results reported above suggest that the four critical neurons @xmath18,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 , identified in the network with correlations t1 plus t2 should have a key role in the onset of the collective bursting .",
    "therefore , we focused our analysis on the pb build up , i.e. we examined the events occurring in a time window of @xmath42 ms preceding the peak of synchronous activation ( for more details see methods ) .",
    "in particular , we quantified how many times each single neuron participated in the build up of a pb .",
    "as we have verified , for the correlated network all the bursts were preceded by the firing of the four critical neurons , while in absence of correlations there was no neuron capable of reliably preceding every burst activation .",
    "the cross correlations between the timing of the first spike emitted by each critical neuron during the pb build up ( see methods ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ clique ] a ( blue histograms ) .",
    "this analysis revealed a precise temporal sequence in the neuronal activation , respectively @xmath43 , as shown also for a few representative bursts in fig .",
    "[ burst_synapse ] a , b ( therefore the labeling assigned to these neurons ) .",
    "interestingly , the same neurons did not show this precise temporal activation out of the pbs , as revealed by the red histograms in fig .",
    "[ clique ] a ( see also methods ) .",
    "furthermore , the time sequence of the firing events of the critical neurons during the build up of the pb was quite well determined : @xmath18 anticipated the firing of @xmath9 of @xmath44 ms , @xmath9 anticipated @xmath10 of @xmath45 ms and @xmath10 anticipated @xmath11 of @xmath46 ms . during the inter - burst periods we observed clear time lagged correlations only for the pair @xmath47 , presenting a direct synaptic connection , and in a weaker manner also for the pair @xmath48 . on the basis of the reported data , we can safely affirm that the critical neurons form a _ functional clique _",
    "responsible for the onset of the pbs .",
    "as clarified in @xcite , the bursting activity was due to the short - term - synaptic depression .",
    "in particular pb emission could be related to the evolution of the fraction of synaptic resources in the recovered state , characterized by the variable @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , averaged over the afferent ( efferent ) synapses of each neuron @xmath27 ( see methods ) .",
    "the authors in @xcite have shown that the fraction of synaptic resources , averaged over all the excitatory synapses , had a deep minimum in correspondence of the burst event and then slowly recovered its stationary value over a time scale dictated by the average recovery time @xmath51 .",
    "this means that the average effective strength of the excitatory connections ( measured by @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) was strongly depressed after a burst , and this inhibited the prosecution of the bursting activity , which could restart only when the strengths of the synapses would return to their stationary values .    in this section , we want to address the question whether the variation of the effective strength of the synapses could be also responsible for the silencing of the network ( with correlations of type t1 plus t2 ) during sns experiments .",
    "so far we have clarified that the removal of any of the four neurons in the functional clique blocked the bursting activity , however it is not clear why a small stimulation of @xmath52 was capable also of blocking the pbs . as reported in fig .",
    "[ effective_synapse ] a , b the stimulation of neuron @xmath11 with a large current @xmath53 mv ( as in the experiment reported in fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi ] a , b ) reduced noticeably @xmath54 , due to the high firing activity of the stimulated neuron .",
    "analogous results have been found for all the other three critical neurons . for neurons",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 this stimulation blocked the bursting activity of the network , thus inducing an almost complete recovery of the available resources of the afferent synapses , measured by @xmath55 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ esempioesperimentobonifazi ] a for @xmath11 ) .",
    "these results could suggest that sns and snd experiments are indeed equivalent , since if the efferent synapses are extremely depressed , this could correspond somehow to remove the neuron from the network .",
    "however , sns of neuron @xmath18 did not lead generically to the suppression of the bursting activity even if its efferent synapses were similarly depressed ( as shown in fig .  [ impatto_di_a_suicritici ] c ) .",
    "furthermore , the synaptic depression could not explain the anti - resonances in the bursting activity observed for sns of @xmath18 and @xmath10 with different @xmath56 . since the time averaged synaptic strength , @xmath57 , exhibited only a smooth decrease as a function of @xmath56 for all the four critical neurons ( as well as for any generic neuron in the network ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ effective_synapse ] c.      as already mentioned , the roles of the four neurons in the functional clique of the network with type t1 and t2 correlations were quite well established , and just a precise firing time sequence could induce the population avalanche . to better understand the role of each critical neuron , it is necessary to point out that , under control conditions , the neurons @xmath18 and @xmath10 could fire even if isolated ( since @xmath58 mv and @xmath59 mv were larger than @xmath60 ) , @xmath9 was at threshold ( @xmath61 mv ) and @xmath11 was the only neuron below threshold ( @xmath62 mv ) .",
    "this clearly explains , given the existing synaptic connection from @xmath18 to @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ clique ] b ) , the reason why @xmath18 entrained @xmath9 , both during the burst build up as well as during the inter - burst periods ( see fig .  [ clique ] ) .",
    "furthermore , from the results of the sns experiments performed on @xmath9 and @xmath11 ( panels d and f in fig .",
    "[ impatto_di_a_suicritici ] ) one can observe that the network activity arrested whenever @xmath63 mv for both these neurons ( for comparison , note that the range of @xmath56 reported in panel c is different from panel d , e and f ) .",
    "therefore , whenever these two neurons fired faster than the clique leader @xmath18 , the burst activity , which should be triggered by a well determined sequence of events , would be terminated .",
    "thus we can conclude that @xmath9 and @xmath11 could only be the followers of the dynamics dictated by the two supra - threshold neurons , and in particular by the leader @xmath18 .    as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ pbrec ] a , exactly before a burst event ( i.e. in the pb build up phase ) neuron @xmath9 fired with a precise time lag after neuron @xmath18 ( blue dashed line in the figure ) . however , the time lag @xmath64 between the firing of @xmath18 and @xmath9 needed some time after each bursting event to adjust to its pre - burst value .",
    "this could be interpreted also as an effective refractory period needed to the pair @xmath18-@xmath9 to recover the proper entrainment favorable to the burst discharge . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pbrec ] a , the time evolution of the variable @xmath65 , which measured the effective strength of the synapse connecting @xmath18 to @xmath9 , is directly connected to the duration of the time interval @xmath64 ( or analogously to the effective refractory time of the entrainment @xmath18-@xmath9 ) . after a burst , @xmath65 was noticeably depressed ( reaching almost zero ) and it slowly recovered its asymptotic value over a time scale dictated by @xmath66 .",
    "indeed @xmath65 was strongly oscillating due to the firings of @xmath18 , however the recovery of the pre - burst condition can be assessed by considering its extreme values ( minima and maxima ) both slowly increasing after the burst .",
    "the recover of the effective synaptic strength was associated to the adjustment of @xmath64 to the value taken during the build up of a pb . from fig .",
    "[ pbrec ] a , it is also evident that the fulfillment of this condition was not sufficient to induce another pb , since the pb could occur even a long time after the favorable pre - burst value was reached by @xmath64 .",
    "similar behaviors had been observed also for the synapse connecting @xmath10 to @xmath11 , although the firing of neuron @xmath10 alone was not sufficient to bring @xmath11 above threshold and therefore to initiate the pb .",
    "indeed , the activation of @xmath11 , whose firing was fundamental to trigger the avalanche , was more complex . from a structural point of view , the neuron @xmath11 received inputs directly from @xmath9 and @xmath10 , while there were no synaptic connections between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ clique ] b ) .",
    "the entrained firing of the pair @xmath67 followed by the firing of @xmath10 , within a precise time window , was required to induce @xmath11 to emit a spike and therefore a pb .",

    "[ pbrec ] c , where @xmath9 fired essentially always at the same time after @xmath18 , but instead the time delay @xmath68 in the firing of @xmath10 was extremely variable ranging from an almost coincidence with @xmath18 to a delay of 100 ms .",
    "the pb could occur only when @xmath10 fired in a precise time window following the activation of @xmath18 . once noticed that the most part of the pb failures are due to @xmath10 and in a first attempt to understand the emergence of bursts in the network",
    ", we can focus only on the firing times of neuron @xmath18 and @xmath10 .    to get a deeper insight on this issue ,",
    "let us consider the anti - resonances ( corresponding to minima in the pb activity ) observed during the sns experiments performed on @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ impatto_di_a_suicritici ] c ) .",
    "to interpret such minima we examined the firing periods @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the neuron @xmath18 and @xmath10 once isolated from the network .",
    "for the lif model  @xcite these are simply given by @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 $ ] , where @xmath73 is the stimulation current acting on @xmath18 and @xmath74 the intrinsic excitability of @xmath10 .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab1 ] the pb minima were associated to rational ratios of these periods .",
    "this amounts to exact frequency locking of the firing of the two neurons  @xcite , whenever this occurs the bursting activity is depressed or even suppressed .",
    "this because the build up of a burst relies on a precise temporal mismatch between the firing of neuron @xmath18 and @xmath10 , which , in the case of exact locking , can be achieved quite rarely or even never .",
    "therefore , given the absence of any structural connection among these two neurons , the clique functionality relied on unsupervised coordinated firing of @xmath18 and @xmath10 .    in order to confirm this hypothesis",
    ", we developed a simple model to reproduce the results of the sns experiment on @xmath18 . in particular , we assumed that @xmath18 and @xmath10 could be considered as two independently spiking neurons with their own firing periods determined by the stimulation current @xmath75 for @xmath18 and by the intrinsic excitability for @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we assumed that a pb is emitted with a certain probability ( related to the synaptic depression induced by the stimulation ) whenever @xmath18 and @xmath10 fired in the correct order and with a prescribed time delay ( for more details see methods ) .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ modello_periodi ] and in the table [ tab1 ] , the agreement is quite surprising due to the limited ingredients employed in the model .",
    "furthermore , the fact that more than the 60% of the `` anti - resonances '' as well as the level of the pb activity were reproduced was a clear indication that the simple ingredients at the basis of the model represented the main mechanisms behind the pb build up process in this network .",
    "these mechanisms could be summarized as follows : the functional clique can be assumed to be composed of two structurally connected pairs @xmath67 and @xmath76 , where @xmath18 and @xmath10 fired tonically and independently one from the other .",
    "any spike emission of @xmath18 induced a firing of @xmath9 , however to recruit @xmath11 and therefore to initiate the pb , also @xmath10 should deliver a spike , with the right time delay after @xmath9 . therefore , if @xmath18 and @xmath10 fired with periods which were rational multiples one of the other it was unlikely to build up the pb . since the synchronism among the two neurons did not allow @xmath9 to participate to the build up of the pb .",

    "[ pbrec ] b and c.",
    "the aim of the present work was to identify neuronal network arrangements sensitive to single neuron perturbations , such as those induced by single neuron stimulation or deletion ( or forced silencing ) .",
    "we choose as a benchmark model a random network of excitatory lif neurons , connected via depressive synapses regulated by the tum mechanism @xcite .",
    "such networks displayed spontaneous bursting activity also in absence of inhibition , as extensively described in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the choice of random topology was aimed at revealing the role of developmentally regulated neuronal excitability and connectivity gradients @xcite , rather than specific topological configurations , in rendering network organization sensitive to single neuron perturbations .",
    "the introduction of a positive correlation between in- and out - degree ( t1 ) and a negative correlation between intrinsic neuronal excitability and total degree ( t2 ) , besides being justified from a developmental point of view , favors also the stabilization of the network activity .",
    "this because , as pointed out in @xcite , in an excitatory network the sensitivity to fluctuations is mainly due to cells with a high out - degree . therefore , to avoid that their activation during spontaneous activity can cause network destabilization , a possible strategy is to impose an anti - correlation between their level of excitability and their degree , as done in the present work , or between in- and out - degree as shown in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when correlations t1 and t2 were embedded in the network , single neuron deletion / stimulation of a few peculiar neurons strongly impacted the frequency of occurrence of population bursts .",
    "most critical neurons , i.e. those capable of silencing the network when deleted or stimulated , shared common features : they constantly / reliably participated in the pb build up ( i.e. they were functional hubs ) and they had a quite low structural degree .",
    "these functional hubs formed a clique , where their precise ordered temporal activation was necessary for the burst generation . in the specific case here described ,",
    "the clique was composed by two synaptically connected pairs , each composed of one neuron above and one below threshold .",
    "the burst could be triggered only when the first three neurons operated at precise time lags and the last neuron of the clique ( which is just below threshold ) was led to fire .",
    "each population burst caused the depletion of the synaptic resources , therefore another pb could occur only when the synaptic resources would be recovered , thus inducing an effective refractory time between two successive pbs . however , this is only a necessary , but not sufficient condition for pb triggering .",
    "the key element responsible for generating pbs was the unsupervised occurrence of a precise sequence of firing times of the two supra - threshold critical neurons , i.e. not mediated by any structural synaptic connection .",
    "on the other hand , the mode locking of the firing frequencies of these two neurons was instead responsible for _ anti - resonances _ associated to a drastic reduction of the pbs . for random networks ,",
    "i.e. with no correlations , or embedding just one of the correlations of type t1 , t2 , t3 or the combination of type t1 and t3 , we did not find any evidence of functional cliques and the mechanisms of network synchronization were much more robust and immune from single neuron perturbations ( see supplementary information ) .    the activity of random uncorrelated networks has been previously examined in  @xcite , in particular the authors have shown that the elimination of a pool of neurons ( namely , @xmath77 neurons , corresponding to the @xmath78 % of the excitatory population ) led to the interruption of the bursting activity .",
    "the pbs were suppressed whenever the removed pool was composed by neurons with an intermediate firing rate @xmath79 hz ) .",
    "these neurons were responsible for triggering the avalanches in the network , due to their effectively strong excitatory synapses and to their proximity to the firing threshold . from these findings",
    ", it is clear that in an uncorrelated network the pbs emerge due to a cooperative effect involving a large portion of neurons . on the contrary",
    ", the introduction of correlations of type t1 and t2 induces single neuron sensitivity as discussed in this paper .",
    "furthermore , our results show that the integration into a clique is the key element that can enable single neurons to impact the population dynamics , without any further topological requirements for the network architecture .",
    "the functional hubs forming and operating within the clique , are actively involved in generating network synchronizations and , as a consequence , capable to impact the network dynamics when stimulated .",
    "therefore , without necessarily being structural or effective hubs , i.e. capable to cause a direct influence on the activity of many other nodes @xcite , they operate as _ operational hubs _ accordingly to the definition recently introduced in  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the hub cells in the developing hippocampus whose stimulation was capable to drastically reduce the frequency of spontaneous network synchronization  @xcite , the critical neurons presented in this paper have a very high functional connectivity and several of them are close to the firing threshold .    at variance with hippocampal hubs , critical neurons",
    "do not have a high structural degree .",
    "this is a consequence of the correlation imposed on the network where the excitability of the neurons is anti - correlated to the total structural degree of the cells .",
    "indeed , in the correlated network studied in this work , the orchestration of the neuronal activity relies on the coordinated firing of a few critical `` young '' neurons ( i.e. with a low structural degree ) mediated by their inter - connections .",
    "however , in real biological developing networks , it is possible that a further developmental connectivity regulation is fulfilled , with the chance of finding synaptic connections in a pair of young cells much lower compared to a pair composed of a young and a mature cells",
    ". this would be also in line to the _ rich gets richer _ rule which can generate scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "in such case , the orchestration between unconnected young neurons would require the presence of a structural connector or hub , i.e. a more developed neuron , capable to receive and promptly activate in the presence of a few synchronized inputs .",
    "therefore , our study supports the hypothesis that , in developmentally constrained networks , pbs are triggered by a precise time activation of a few around threshold oscillators .",
    "this is indeed the case of neurons @xmath9 and @xmath11 , which are fundamental for the ignition of the neuronal avalanche , but they need to be activated by a precise firing sequence involving @xmath18 and @xmath10 .",
    "this evidence is even more striking in the example discussed in text s3 for @xmath2 neurons , where the functional clique is composed of a small group of neurons all just below threshold , apart the leader who activates the neurons in cascade leading to the burst .",
    "we have verified that the main ingredients required to observe strong sensitivity to single neuron stimulation and deletion are , besides the presence of the correlations of type t1 and t2 , a small number of neurons supra - threshold as well as a strongly diluted network .",
    "this can find an explanation in the fact that by increasing the degree of the neurons as well as the number of neurons supra - threshold the network dynamics becomes more cooperative .",
    "furthermore , the synaptic time scales seem not to be crucial for the emergence of single neuron sensitivity ( for more details see the subsection dependence on the model parameters in methods ) .",
    "although presented within a developmental framework , our results can also have elements of interest in the wider context of brain processing .",
    "in fact , in this work we show that the introduction of an excitability gradient in the network can lead to the emergence of functional cliques capable to shape the neuronal population activity . indeed",
    ", different brain states could dynamically modulate the level of excitability or the gain function of the neurons within a circuit ( as clearly discussed in @xcite ) and in this way instantaneously induce the emergence of functional cliques .",
    "furthermore , functional chains of neural activation have been reported also in the different framework of feed - forward networks  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "in ref.@xcite the authors found that structural hubs ( i.e. highly connected neurons ) have a peculiar role in promoting the signal transmission across sequences of non - hub sub - networks .",
    "the previously discussed anti - resonance effect leading to the silence of the bursting activity resembles recent results reported in literature  @xcite , where the authors have shown that abnormally synchronous neuronal populations can be desynchronized by administrating stimulations at resonant frequencies to an ensemble of spiking neurons . in that context",
    ", the desynchronization of the neuronal activity can be achieved by delivering a periodic stimulation at few sites , with a period which was an integer multiple of the fundamental period of the synchronized system .",
    "this is in striking contrast with what usually observed for a resonant forcing of a population of coupled oscillators  @xcite . our results , revealing population desynchronization associated to anti - resonances at the level of single neuron frequencies , are even more intriguing . on one side",
    "these findings suggest the possibility of extremely non - invasive procedures to treat pathological neuronal synchronization , which is associated to several neurological disorders @xcite . on the other side",
    "they reveal the potentiality of a brain circuit able to adapt to external stimuli on the basis of unsupervised mechanisms , which can switch the network activity from coherent to incoherent .",
    "the numerical results here presented predict a primary role for supra - threshold and near - threshold cells capable to impact network synchronizations when organized into functional clique . probing the existence of such cliques",
    ", whose emergence could be also dynamically regulated by varying the gradient of excitability in the circuits  @xcite , is experimentally challenging , but surely feasible in _ in - vitro _ biological preparations .",
    "cultured networks allow for an easier access and probing of the circuits  @xcite , while representing a general model of unsupervised ( or self - organized ) spontaneous network synchronization in circuits under development , analogously to what observed in central and peripheral brain circuits  @xcite . in these circuits",
    "high functionally connected neurons ( mostly activated at the build up of bursting ) and highly active ( i.e. supra - threshold ) neurons could be identified by using both multi - electrode recordings and/or calcium imaging  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by manipulating the frequency of firing of such cells through multi - site optical or electrical stimulation  @xcite it is possible both to disrupt the sequential activation necessary for triggering network synchronizations ( as displayed in figs .",

    "we still observed that the network can be silenced by single neuron stimulation / removal .",
    "furthermore , the dependence on the system size seemed not be crucial , since as described in text s3 by doubling the system size a functional clique can still be identified .",

    "in all the performed experiments the parameter values are taken from random distributions with the same averages and standard deviations as reported in methods .",
    "furthermore , the networks have been realized with the same average in - degree and the same constraints described in methods . in five of the examined cases we found a response to sns / snd experiments qualitatively similar to the one examined in the paper . in particular , we have identified a number of critical neurons ranging from 6 to 3 in each realization with associated intrinsic excitability in the range @xmath203 $ ] mv , i.e. slightly below or above the firing threshold . in most of the cases the critical clique contained two neurons supra - threshold , as in the example discussed in the paper .",
    "furthermore , in four cases the stimulation / deletion of the critical neurons lead to the total suppression of the bursting activity ( within the considered time interval ) , while in one case we observed very strong reductions of the population bursts ( up to 65% of the activity recorded in control conditions ) .      in order to test if the size had any influence in the observed phenomena , we considered a directed random graph with @xmath204 neurons and an average in - degree @xmath112 and with the embedded correlations of type t1 and t2 .",
    "the network activity was still characterized by bursts of duration @xmath137 ms and with interburst intervals @xmath136 ms , thus suggesting that the doubling of the size had not altered the main dynamical features of the network .",
    "we performed snd and sns experiments also in the present case .",
    "snd experiments revealed that the removal of 3 critical neurons can lead to the complete silence of the network , these neurons are identified in fig .",
    "s2 by the labels @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 . as shown in fig .",
    "s2 b , the sns experiments , performed with stimulation current @xmath182 mv , confirmed the capability of neurons @xmath184 and @xmath185 to silence the network , while sns on neuron @xmath183 reduced the pbs of @xmath205 .",
    "the most critical neurons were all unable to fire if isolated from the network , i.e. they were all below threshold , apart neuron @xmath183 , which had @xmath206 mv .",
    "an extensive investigation of the critical neurons subjected to stimulations with currents in the range @xmath186 $ ] mv revealed that pbs can be observed only if the neurons @xmath184 and @xmath185 had excitabilities within a narrow range ( of amplitude @xmath40 mv ) centered around the threshold value . while , the stimulation of neuron @xmath183 revealed an absolute minimum in the pb activity ( an _ anti - resonance _ ) at @xmath207 mv and a relative minimum at @xmath208 mv ( see fig .",
    "we performed also an extensive analysis of the response under sns experiments for all the neurons of the network . as it is summarized in fig .",
    "s2 e , we found only sporadic significant reduction in the number of pbs occurring in extremely narrow current intervals .",
    "therefore also for @xmath2 we observed that snd or sns were capable to silence the network and that this occurred only for a quite limited number of neurons , which had low @xmath23 and reasonably high @xmath22 .",
    "the detailed investigation of the burst events revealed that each pb was always preceeded by the firing of the 3 critical neurons in the following order : @xmath209 pb , as it is shown in fig .",
    "s2 fg . the neuron @xmath183 , which was the only one supra - threshold , fired first followed by the others ( sub - threshold ) and this triggered the onset of the pb .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "s2 d , whenever @xmath184 and @xmath210 were stimulated with currents @xmath211 mv the bursting activity stopped .",
    "this behaviour is analogous to what reported for the smaller network , indicating that neuron @xmath210 is the leader and the other ones are simply followers in the construction of the pb , they can not fire more rapidly then neuron @xmath210 or the pbs ceased .",
    "an analysis of the structural connectivity revealed that neuron @xmath183 projected an efferent synapse on @xmath184 , which projected on @xmath185 .",
    "we can safely affirm , also in this case , that neurons @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 form a functional clique , whose sequential activation is essential for the population burst onset ."
