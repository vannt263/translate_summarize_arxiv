    "the high mobility 2d electron system ( 2des ) exhibits zero - resistance states at the minima of giant magnetoresistance oscillations induced by microwave and terahertz excitation at low magnetic fields and low temperatures.@xcite these radiation - induced zero resistance states differ from the well - known quantized hall effect zero - resistance states by the necessity of photo - excitation for the observability of the effect and the absence of concurrent plateaus in the hall effect . the huge photo - induced modulation of the dark magnetoresistance in this special photo - response of the 2des yields potential applications in microwave and terahertz wave sensing.@xcite    the amplitude of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations ( rimos ) depends on factors such as radiation frequency@xcite ; temperature@xcite , radiation power@xcite , linear polarization direction@xcite , angle between magnetic field and sample normal@xcite and current through sample@xcite .",
    "all these factors have been examined both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "however , there are still open questions , two of which are the microwave power dependence and microwave polarization dependence of rimos . for the power dependence",
    ", there has been a debate whether the amplitude of rimos increases linearly with the microwave power as indicated by the inelastic model@xcite . here",
    ", some experimental work@xcite and the radiation driven electron orbital model@xcite have suggested that the rimos amplitude actually increases sublinearly in the microwave power .",
    "so far as the role of microwave polarization in rimos is concerned , the inelastic model@xcite and experiment@xcite indicated that rimos are independent of the polarization angle of linearly polarized microwave , while another set of experiments@xcite and theory , i.e , the displacement model@xcite and the radiation driven electron orbital model@xcite , suggested that the rimo amplitude depends on the polarization angle of linearly polarized microwave . indeed ,",
    "@xcite has demonstrated a sinusoidal relation , i.e. , @xmath3 , between rimo amplitude @xmath0 and linear polarization angle @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the results indicated that , at high radiation intensities , there was a systematic deviation in the polarization angle dependence from this cosine - square rule.@xcite this result , see fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , indicated rimos polarization angle dependence is affected by the radiation intensity .",
    "the motivation for the present study has , therefore , been to understand the role of the microwave power / intensity in the linear - polarization - angle dependence of rimos .",
    "experiments were carried out on hall bars fabricated from high mobility gaas / algaas heterojunctions .",
    "a long cylindrical waveguide sample holder with sample mounted at the end was inserted into a variable temperature insert ( vti ) , inside the bore of a superconducting solenoid .",
    "a temperature of 1.5k was realized by pumping on the liquid helium within the vti insert .",
    "the specimens reached the high mobility condition after brief illumination with a red light - emitting - diode at low temperature .",
    "a commercially available microwave synthesizer was used to provide microwave illumination via a launcher at the top of sample holder .",
    "the linearly polarization angle is defined as the angle between the long axis of the hall bar and the microwave antenna in the microwave launcher .",
    "this angle was changed by rotating the microwave launcher outside the cryostat , see fig .",

    ", the peaks and valleys are denoted by `` p '' and `` v '' .",
    "thus , for instance , p1 and v1 indicate the first prominent peak and valley , respectively , from the high magnetic field direction .",

    "figure 3 shows the contour plots of p1@xmath10 , v1@xmath10 and p2@xmath10 on left column .",

    "although @xmath0 vs @xmath1 curves for different polarization angles separate once microwave power start to increase from zero , they could still be normalized to the same curve with dividing abscissa by a scaling factor @xmath19@xcite .",
    "such scaling factors are different for different polarization angles .",
    "the reciprocal scaling factor is also a cosine square function of linear polarization angle , and it follows @xmath20@xcite . in the right column of fig .",
    "3 , the ordinate - scales constitute a normalized scale , which means the microwave power scale is divided by the scaling factors that belong to each polarization angle .",
    "although experiments were carried out with @xmath21 mw , after normalization , for some polarization angles , the normalized power would cover a smaller range because the scaling factor @xmath19 can exceed unity .",
    "since , here all the power scales are normalized with respect to the one for @xmath22 , @xmath23 spans full range at @xmath17 and @xmath24 .",
    "the normalization has the effect of compressing data in the ordinate direction away from @xmath25 and @xmath26 . as a result",
    ", white spaces appear in the color plots of the right column . in fig .",

    "interestingly , the profile or envelope of @xmath23 vs @xmath2 in the contour plots of fig .",
    "3(g ) to ( i ) are sinusoidal and the peaks appear at @xmath17 and @xmath24 , which suggests that the profile curve can be described by @xmath27 .    the left column of fig .",

    "4 show a deviation from simple sinusoidal behavior with increasing @xmath1 as reported in @xcite . here , for p1@xmath10 and p2@xmath10 the valleys become sharper as microwave power increases from 0.1 mw to 4 mw and for v1@xmath10 the peaks become sharper as the power increases .",
    "simultaneously , with increasing @xmath1 , the peaks of p1@xmath10 and p2@xmath10 become more broadened , and at 4 mw , the peak of p2@xmath10 shows signs of forming a broad plateau - like structure .",
    "the valleys of v1@xmath10 also become more broadened with increasing @xmath1 . in comparing the deviation from sinusoidal behavior for p1@xmath10 and p2@xmath10",
    ", the change in the @xmath0 vs @xmath2 line shape is more obvious for p2@xmath28 than p1@xmath10 , which suggests the @xmath0 vs @xmath2 line shape evolution with microwave power becomes more pronounced at lower magnetic fields .",
    "so far as the phase is concerned , in the left column contour plots , , vertical dashed lines point out phase angle , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath0 vs. @xmath1 at this phase angle are plotted in the right panel of fig .",

    "4 , at @xmath22 , @xmath0 either increases ( for p1@xmath10 and p2@xmath10 ) or decreases ( for v1@xmath10 ) as the microwave power increases , but the rate of change of @xmath0 with @xmath1 are different , see also the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 plots in the right column of fig .",
    "it appears that the different non - linearity at different polarization angles is the main cause for the distortion of @xmath0 vs @xmath2 curves from simple sinusoidal form at high microwave powers .",
    "we have examined the line shape evolution , or more specifically , the line shape distortion , of @xmath0 vs @xmath2 observed with increasing @xmath1 , especially at high microwave powers .",
    "the exhibited results indicate : i ) microwave power and linear polarization angle both influence the oscillatory @xmath0 in the high mobility 2des in the regime of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "ii ) at the peaks or valleys of the rimos , @xmath0 is not a linear function of microwave power .",
    "iii ) @xmath0 vs @xmath1 curves at different polarization angles exhibit different non - linearity .",
    "however , they can be normalized to the same curve using an empirical power scaling factor @xmath19 .",
    "this also suggests , see fig .",
    "3 ( g ) to ( i ) , that the amplitude of rimos may be sensitive to an effective microwave power , which is a cosine square function of polarization angle .",
    "iv ) the difference in the non - linearity of @xmath0 s power dependence at different polarization angles is the factor that makes @xmath0 vs @xmath2 deviate from cosine square function at high microwave powers .    regarding the microwave power dependence and linear polarization dependence of rimos , previous studies@xcite",
    "have also drawn the conclusion that at the magnetic fields corresponding to the extrema of rimos , the @xmath0 varies nonlinearly with @xmath1 and the extremal @xmath0 follows @xmath30 at low @xmath1 . regarding the polarization dependent distortion from cosine square function at high microwave power range",
    ", one must consider power and polarization angle together . among the available theoretical models ,",
    "few have considered both power dependence and polarization dependent at once .",
    "one model that considers them both is the radiation driven electron orbital model@xcite , which describes a periodic back - and - forth radiation - driven motion of the electron orbits and the conductivity modulation resulting from the average scattering jump .",
    "simulations based on this model indicate a non - linear power dependence of rimos@xcite , i.e. , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the amplitude of rimos , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants and @xmath1 is microwave power .",
    "moreover , the polarization dependence simulation@xcite appear to suggest a distorted cosine square function .",
    "it seems plausible that if microwave power and polarization angle are considered together , this theory might model the power and polarization dependence of microwave - induced oscillatory magnetoresistance .",
    "the displacement model@xcite , which describes microwave photo - excited electrons scattered by impurities , and gives rise to an additional current density due to radiation , also considered the polarization dependence as sinusoidal@xcite .",
    "however , this simulation has not yet included the power dependence .",
    "also , the microwave intensities used in this simulation are quite different from the experimental intensities .",
    "another displacement model simulation@xcite has also studied the microwave power dependence of rimos .",
    "they stated that photo - conductivity @xmath35 , at extrema of rimos , is a non - linear function of microwave power in the electron transition between adjacent landau levels .",
    "this non - linearity is apparent especially at high microwave power range .",
    "however , this displacement model simulation indicated neither the polarization dependence nor its distortion due to high power .",
    "one might expect , however , to see the polarization dependent curve distortion at relative high microwave power in simulations utilizing the displacement model .",
    "most other theoretical models have not predicted polarization dependence of rimos , not to mention the @xmath0 vs @xmath36 line shape distortion due to high microwave power .",
    "in conclusion , we have examined the evolution of the lineshape of @xmath0 vs @xmath2 in rimos with @xmath1 using color contour plots of @xmath0 as a function of both microwave power @xmath1 and linear polarization angle @xmath2 .",
    "the different non - linearity of @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 traces at different polarization angles is found to be the main factor that influences line shape distortion of the sinusoidal @xmath0 vs. @xmath2 relation .",
    "as well , this work support the non - linear power dependent and generally sinusoidal polarization dependence of rimos at low @xmath1 .",
