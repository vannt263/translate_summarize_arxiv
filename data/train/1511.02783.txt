    "recently , multiferroic behavior and static magnetoelectric effects have been observed in many members of the melilite family , e.g. , ca@xmath0cosi@xmath0o@xmath1 , sr@xmath0cosi@xmath0o@xmath1 , ba@xmath0mnge@xmath0o@xmath1and ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1[see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "the dynamical magnetoelectric effect , also observed in these compounds , drastically changes the optical properties of multiferroics compared with conventional materials .",
    "for instance , a recent work of  @xcite discovered quadrochroism at the magnetoelectric spin excitations of multiferroic ca@xmath0cosi@xmath0o@xmath1 , sr@xmath0cosi@xmath0o@xmath1and ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 .    due to the lack of complete structural phase diagrams in the case of melilites , the high symmetry melilite phase is often used as a basis for theoretical calculations and experimental investigations [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "however , the melilite family shows a variety of structural phase transitions , including incommensurate phases , depending on temperature and chemical composition .",
    "the knowledge about the precise crystal structure is a very important input to understand magnetoelectric phenomena in multiferroics .",
    "for instance , in the work of  @xcite the main features of the magnetoelectric behaviour in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1were predicted by symmetry considerations without referring to any specific microscopic mechanism .",
    "thus , the exact structural model is often an essential starting point for further theoretical and experimental research .",
    "the results of our previous synchrotron x - ray diffraction study on ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1below room temperature  ( ) are in favour of a symmetry lowering from the high - temperature tetragonal structure with space - group ( sg ) @xmath2to the orthorhombic sg @xmath3 .",
    "the assumption of the symmetry reduction was based on both the presence of reflections forbidden in @xmath2  ( ) and the found magnetic space group ( msg ) @xmath4  ( ) . the msg was then independently confirmed  ( ) by polarised neutron diffraction , namely the spherical neutron polarimetry technique . in contrast ,",
    "the origin of the observed superstructure reflections in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1was never cross - checked by other methods .",
    "an observation of the weak , but well noticeable intensities at the positions of forbidden reflections in reciprocal space for other melilite compounds , such as ca@xmath0cosi@xmath0o@xmath1and ba@xmath0mnge@xmath0o@xmath1motivated us to re - investigate this effect more precisely .    in order to differentiate between real symmetry lowering and multiple diffraction ( the renninger effect ) , neutron diffraction with both short ( hot neutrons ) and long ( cold neutrons ) wavelengths",
    "was applied .",
    "multiple diffraction patterns ( the so - called @xmath5 scans ) were simulated before the experiment in order to select the most appropriate wavelength and positions in reciprocal space .",
    "it was found , that the scattered intensity detected at the positions of forbidden reflections are entirely due to multiple diffraction .",
    "thus , the crystal structure of ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1at room temperature ( rt ) can be perfectly described by the tetragonal sg @xmath2 .",
    "we present here the results of the model selection based on the multiple diffraction patterns as well as the complete structure refinement of ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1at rt using neutron diffraction .",
    "single crystals of ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1were grown by the floating - zone technique and were well characterised in previous studies [ see   and references therein ] .",
    "the sample used for the neutron diffraction experiment has a cylindrical shape of approximately 5 mm in height and about the same diameter .",
    "single - crystal neutron diffraction studies with both short and long wavelengths were performed on the two diffractometers heidi  ( ) and mira  ( ) at the frmii reactor , heinz - maier - leibnitz zentrum ( mlz ) , germany . on heidi",
    ", the wavelength @xmath6  was obtained from a ge(422 ) monochromator with an er - filter used to suppress the @xmath7 contamination .",
    "a @xmath8he point detector , optimised for neutrons with short wavelength , was used for the measurements of both @xmath5 scans and a full data collection at room temperature .",
    "on mira , the wavelength @xmath9  was obtained from a hopg monochromator with be - filter to suppress the @xmath7 contamination .",
    "both point and position sensitive detectors were used for the measurements of @xmath5 scans at room temperature .    on both instruments ,",
    "an eulerian cradle was used and the sample was oriented in a way to have the forbidden reflections of the ( @xmath1000 ) type in the scattering plane when the @xmath11 angle in the conventional 4-cycle geometry was approx .",
    "this geometry allows an easy rotation around @xmath5 by 360@xmath12as it almost coincides with the conventional @xmath13 rotation .",
    "as the first step of the measurements , the orientation matrix was refined .",
    "secondly , the conventional @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 values for any of the requested @xmath5 angles were calculated by the dif4n   program .",
    "then , an @xmath15 scan was performed for each @xmath5 value and the integrated intensity of the scan was assigned to that @xmath5 point . as a result ,",
    "the integrated intensity versus @xmath5 curve was obtained and further compared with the calculations of possible multiple diffraction .",
    "the integrated intensities of the reflections collected with point detector were obtained using the davinci program  ( ) . the multiple diffraction patterns were simulated using the umweg program  ( ) . the structural parameters of ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1were refined from the full data collection using the jana2006 program  ( ) .",

    ": sndexperiment]single - crystal neutron diffraction experimental and refinement details .",
