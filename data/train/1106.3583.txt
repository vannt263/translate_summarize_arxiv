    "the cdf collaboration has recently announced the observation of an excess of events containing a lepton ( electron or muon ) , missing transverse energy , and two jets  @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as the production of a new state with a mass of @xmath3150 - 160 gev which decays to quarks or gluons , along with a standard model @xmath4 decaying to an electron or muon along with a neutrino .",
    "this excess of events , which was observed in 7.3 fb@xmath5 of cdf data , has been reported to be statistically significant at a level of 4.1@xmath6 .",
    "although the d0 collaboration does not find evidence of such a sizable excess in their analysis of 4.3 fb@xmath5 of data  @xcite , a signal roughly half as large as reported by cdf might be consistent with both experimental results .",
    "although several explanations have been proposed for the cdf excess  @xcite , perhaps the simplest is the introduction of a new gauge boson  @xcite . in order to evade constraints from lep ii and the tevatron ,",
    "however , such a state must have couplings to leptons ( or more specifically , to electrons and muons ) which are suppressed by at least a factor of 4 - 5 relative to those to quarks  @xcite .",
    "a gauge boson with these characteristics is commonly known as a leptophobic @xmath1 .",
    "new @xmath7 gauge groups and the @xmath1 bosons which accompany them are found in many phenomenologically viable and well motivated extensions of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "such extensions introduce anomalies , however , whose cancellation requires the addition of new fermions . the sole exception to",
    "this rule is a @xmath1 which couples to baryon minus lepton number .",
    "thus any anomaly - free , flavor universal model that contains a leptophobic @xmath1 must invariably contain new fermions .",
    "additional @xmath7 gauge groups are a feature common to many grand unified theories ( guts ) , including those based on the groups @xmath8 and @xmath0 ( the @xmath9 group is of the same rank as the standard model , and thus does not contain any additional @xmath7 s ) .",
    "the @xmath1 which arises in @xmath8 models , however , is not leptophobic .",
    "as the @xmath0 group is rank 6 ( two higher than the gauge group of the standard model ) , guts based on this group can include two additional @xmath7 s , leading to a variety of possible charge assignments and interactions  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , and as @xmath0 is well motivated within the context of @xmath10 string theory  @xcite , we will focus on supersymmetric guts built upon this gauge group .",
    "models are of course possible . however , for this initial study , we choose this more constrained scenario . ] for a review of @xmath0 models or of guts in general , see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xmath0 can be broken such that @xmath11 , of which the @xmath9 contains the gauge group of the standard model .",
    "the charges of any @xmath12 and the corresponding @xmath1 boson that appears as part of the low - energy theory can be written as a linear combination of the charges of the two additional @xmath7 s in @xmath0 : @xmath13 although for no choice of @xmath14 is @xmath15 completely leptophobic , for the well motivated value of @xmath16 ( known as the @xmath17-model of @xmath0  @xcite , such that @xmath18 ) , kinetic mixing can lead to a @xmath1 with highly suppressed couplings to leptons  @xcite . in particular , although the @xmath19 and @xmath20 gauge groups undergo no kinetic mixing at the @xmath0 breaking scale , if the effective particle content at some lower energy scale does not contain full representations of @xmath0 , kinetic mixing will be generated by renormalization group ( rg ) evolution  @xcite .",
    "the full higgs sector is expected to be split in mass , as some of the scalar fields will have gut - scale vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "thus , during the rg running down to the weak scale , the particle content is such that a non - zero mixing parameter will evolve .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     after accounting for the effects of kinetic mixing , the effective charges of the fermions to the @xmath1 are given by @xmath21 , where the values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are given in table i for all of the fermions in the fundamental 27-dimensional representation of @xmath0 .",
    "for the choice of @xmath25 , the @xmath1 is completely leptophobic ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the size of @xmath27 is highly dependent on the composition and mass scale of the higgs sector ; while the minimal fields required to give masses to the matter * 27*s are not sufficient to generate @xmath28 , we would not expect these to be the only fields of relevance all the way up to the unification scale . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , a reasonable higgs sector was described which naturally leads to @xmath29 . for purposes of explaining the cdf @xmath30dijets",
    "excess , we do not necessarily require complete leptophobia , and values in the range of @xmath31 are acceptable .",
    ", one may also consider models in which baryon number and lepton number are gauged  @xcite . alternatively",
    ", a @xmath1 could acquire couplings to standard model quarks through higher dimensional effective operators  @xcite . ] throughout the remainder of this paper , we carry out our calculations using the choice of @xmath25 .    with mixing between @xmath32 and @xmath17",
    ", the photon , @xmath33 and @xmath1 will be linear combinations of the neutral gauge bosons of the @xmath19 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 gauge groups .",
    "this induces corrections to the electroweak precision observables , which place limits on leptophobic @xmath0 models from lep and other precision measurements .",
    "although constrained , some regions of mixing parameter space remain allowed for a leptophobic @xmath1 of mass @xmath3150 gev  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we look to the matter content of @xmath0 guts for a viable candidate for the dark matter of our universe . in @xmath0 ,",
    "the fermions of the standard model come as part of three copies ( one per generation ) of the 27-dimensional fundamental representation .",
    "each * 27 * of @xmath0 decomposes into a * 16 * , * 10 * and * 1 * of @xmath8 . the fermions of the standard model , along with a singlet @xmath36 , fill the * 16 * , and are further decomposed into a * 10 * ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) , and * 1 * ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath9 . in this context",
    ", @xmath36 may be viewed as a right handed neutrino .",
    "in addition , the * 27 * contains `` exotic '' fermions occupying the * 10 * and * 1 * of @xmath0 .",
    "the 10 dimensional representation decomposes into a * 5 * ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) of @xmath9 . the state @xmath48 is a singlet under both @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus the exotics of the * 27 * consist of a vector - like , color singlet , weak isodoublet with electric charges of @xmath49 ( @xmath46 , @xmath43 ) , a vector - like color triplet , weak isosinglet with @xmath50 ( @xmath44 , @xmath47 ) , and two neutral singlets ( @xmath36 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "see table  i for a decomposition of the * 27 * along with their gauge charges .",
    "the matter fields in the * 27 * get mass terms through interactions with higgs fields appearing in additional representations of @xmath0 . in the breaking scheme of the @xmath0 @xmath17-model ,",
    "at least four higgs fields are required  @xcite .",
    "two of these are @xmath35 isodoublets , corresponding to the up- and down - type higgses of the mssm , with hypercharges of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . additionally , these two fields must have @xmath24 ( @xmath53 ) charges of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the remaining two higgs fields serve to give masses to the exotics in the * 27 * s ; these scalars must be isosinglets with @xmath56 and have @xmath17 charges @xmath57 and @xmath58 , giving @xmath53 charges of + 1 and + 2 .",
    "it is the vevs of these higgs that can serve to break @xmath53 and give mass to the leptophobic @xmath1 . from the mass of the @xmath1",
    ", we expect the new higgs vevs to be on the order of the weak scale .    among these exotics ,",
    "both @xmath36 and @xmath48 are not colored , are electrically neutral , and thus are potentially viable candidates for dark matter .",
    "furthermore , they each carry large charges of the leptophobic gauge group ( @xmath59 ) , potentially providing an important role for the @xmath1 in cosmology as well as in collider physics .",
    "charges as normalized in table  i , absorbing the factor of @xmath60 into the definition of the gauge coupling constant . ] we take our dark matter candidate to be the scalar superpartner of the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath36 , which will be stable by the virtue of @xmath61-parity ( this dark matter candidate has previously been considered in ref .",
    "we could also consider the superpartner of the @xmath48 , which is identical for the purposes of direct detection , but is disfavored by relic abundance considerations as described in sec .",
    "[ ann ] . to retain a degree of agnosticism toward this choice ( or a linear combination of these choices ) , we will refer to the scalar dark matter particle simply as @xmath62 .",

    "favors a value of roughly @xmath68  @xcite . to bring this into better compatibility with the null results of d0  @xcite , however , we will adopt a somewhat smaller value of @xmath69 .    through @xmath1 exchange ,",
    "the dark matter can scatter elastically with nuclei  @xcite .",

    ", we arrive at @xmath73 to compare with the results of direct detection experiments , we calculate the spin - independent elastic scattering cross section of our dark matter candidate with neutrons ( not to be confused with nucleons , as is often presented ) : @xmath74    in fig .",
    "[ direct ] , we compare this result to the cross section and mass required to explain the signals reported by the cogent  @xcite and dama / libra  @xcite collaborations ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for dark matter with a mass of approximately 6 - 8 gev ( and for a velocity distribution described by @xmath75 km / s and @xmath76 km / s ) ,",
    "the signals reported by these two experiments can be accommodated by the @xmath0 gut model discussed here .",
    "we also show for comparison the constraints as presented by the cdms  @xcite ( dashed ) and xenon100  @xcite ( dotted ) collaborations .",
    "although the results from cdms appear to be in some degree of tension with a dark matter interpretation of cogent and dama / libra , it is not necessarily implausible that systematic uncertainties could open a region of compatibility  @xcite .",
    "the constraints placed on light dark matter particles by xenon100 ( and other liquid xenon detectors ) depend critically on the scintillation efficiency of liquid xenon at the lowest measured energies , and may well be less stringent than have been reported  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we turn our attention to the annihilation of the dark matter candidate appearing in the @xmath17-model of @xmath0 .",
    "first , we consider annihilations through the @xmath77-channel exchange of the @xmath1 , which leads to a cross section given by : @xmath78,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the relative velocity between two dark matter particles and the sum is performed over all favors of left and right - handed quarks lighter than @xmath80 .",
    "note that the annihilation cross section is velocity suppressed ( i.e. ,  @xmath81 ) . to determine the thermal relic abundance of dark matter",
    ", we consider the thermally weighted cross section at the temperature of freeze - out : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ratio of @xmath80 to the freeze - out temperature .",
    "the dark matter s annihilation cross section is related to its thermal relic abundance according to @xmath84 annihilations of dark matter through the @xmath1 thus provide only a small fraction ( @xmath35% ) of the cross section required to yield our universe s observed dark matter density .",
    "therefore processes other than @xmath1 exchange must contribute to the dark matter s annihilation in the early universe .",
    "the most general renormalizable superpotential describing the interactions within the * 27 * that is consistent with the symmetries of the standard model is given by : @xmath85 depending on the lepton and baryon number assignments of the exotic particle content of the * 27 * , some of these terms will need to be suppressed in order to maintain approximate low - scale lepton and baryon number conservation .    among these 11 terms",
    ", there are no interactions which directly connect the @xmath48 ( or its superpartner ) to the fields of the standard model .",
    "for this reason , we will focus our attention on the case in which the dark matter is the superpartner of @xmath36 .",
    "the interactions described by the terms @xmath86 and @xmath87 allow the dark matter to annihilate into down - type quarks through the @xmath88-channel exchange of a @xmath44 or to leptons through the @xmath88-channel exchange of a @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "as null results from the lhc force states with qcd color such as @xmath44 to be quite heavy ( above several hundred gev ) , we focus on the case of annihilation to charged and neutral leptons through a @xmath89 or @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "assuming for simplicity that @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 have similar values for each generation ( in each * 27 * ) , the dark matter s annihilation cross section to charged leptons and neutrinos is approximately given by  @xcite : @xmath94 , \\label{tch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term proceeds to @xmath95 while the terms in the sum proceeds to a mixture of charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "in the low - velocity limit , the annihilation cross section to @xmath95 given by : @xmath96 thus for the purposes of indirect detection , the dark matter will annihilate primarily to @xmath95 , possibly with an order @xmath310% contribution to @xmath97-quarks through @xmath88-channel @xmath44 exchange .",
    "we note that in order for this annihilation process to proceed , either ( but not both of ) @xmath36 or @xmath43 must carry lepton number .    after thermally averaging at the temperature of freeze - out , the @xmath98 terms of the cross section given in eq .",
    "[ tch ] becomes : @xmath99 combining this with the results from eqs .  7 and  11 , we find a total value which is very similar to that required to thermally generate the observed density of dark matter .",
    "the leptophilic annihilations of the dark matter is of particular interest within the context of gamma ray observations of the galactic center . in fig .",
    "[ indirect ] , we compare the spectrum of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations in the galactic center predicted in our model to the excess emission observed by the fermi gamma ray space telescope  @xcite ( assuming an extrapolation of the spectrum from the milky way s supermassive black hole ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . clearly , very good agreement is found .",
    "dark matter in the mass range described here and which annihilates primarily to charged leptons has also been previously shown to be able to produce the observed synchrotron emission known as the wmap haze  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "lastly we note the constraints from searches for gev - scale neutrinos from the sun as conducted by super - kamiokande  @xcite are safely evaded in this model by virtue of the dark matter s suppressed couplings to protons .",
    "in summary , motivated by the @xmath2+dijets excess recently reported by the cdf collboration , we have considered grand unified models based on the @xmath0 group . such models ( in particular , the so - called @xmath17-model of @xmath0 ) , can contain a leptophobic @xmath1 boson capable of producing the observed excess . within the fundamental representation of @xmath0 is an attractive dark matter candidate in the form of a right - handed sneutrino . from the sizable couplings of this dark matter candidate to the @xmath1 , a large elastic scattering cross section with neutrons is predicted , consistent with the direct detection signals reported by the cogent and dama / libra collaborations .",
    "furthermore , to avoid being overproduced in the early universe , the dark matter must annihilate to leptons through the exchange of other particles contained within the fundamental representation of @xmath0 , leading to a gamma ray spectrum and flux consistent with that observed from the galactic center by the fermi gamma ray space telescope .",
