    "toomre s ( 1964 ) stability criterion , @xmath2 , is one of the pillars of disc galaxy dynamics ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "it is used in a wide variety of contexts ; in star formation for example , where the gravitational instability of the interstellar gas plays a critical role ( e.g. , quirk 1972 ; kennicutt 1989 ; martin & kennicutt 2001 ; schaye 2004 , 2008 ; burkert 2009 ; elmegreen 2009 ) .",
    "so why introduce a new stability criterion ?",
    "because behind toomre s criterion there is one fundamental assumption : the medium is approximately in equilibrium , with well - defined surface density @xmath3 and velocity dispersion @xmath4 .",
    "but this is far from being true in the clumpy and turbulent interstellar gas , where such quantities depend strongly on @xmath5 , the size of the region over which they are measured .",
    "in fact , a fundamental aspect of interstellar turbulence is the existence of density- and velocity - size scaling laws : @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 )",
    ". in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , the scaling exponents are @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( e.g. , larson 1981 ; solomon et al.1987 ; bolatto et al .  2008 ;",
    "heyer et al .",
    "2009 ; hughes et al .  2010 ) . in the hi component , density and",
    "velocity fluctuations seem to have a kolmogorov spectrum _ up to galactic scales _ : @xmath10 for @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for @xmath13 ( e.g. , lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ; elmegreen et al .",

    "; dutta et al.2009a , b ) .",
    "note , however , that the uncertainties are large , especially in the hi case .",
    "further evidence for ism turbulence is provided by the ` big power law in the sky ' , i.e.  the fact that electron density fluctuations show a kolmogorov spectrum over a wide range of scales : from @xmath14 km up to 10 pc ( armstrong et al .",
    "1995 ; see chepurnov & lazarian 2010 for the most recent determination of the upper scale ) .",
    "clumpy and turbulent gas is also observed in high - redshift star - forming galaxies , where it dominates the morphology and dynamics of the disc ( e.g. , wadadekar et al .",

    "coming surveys will tell us how @xmath3 and @xmath4 scale with @xmath5 at high @xmath0 , and thus how turbulence develops in disc galaxies .",
    "this is one of the hot topics in modern astrophysics ( e.g. , krumholz & burkert 2010 ) , and several state - of - the - art simulations have already been designed for such a purpose ( e.g. , wada et al .",
    "2002 ; kim & ostriker 2007 ; levine et al .",

    "b ; bournaud & elmegreen 2009 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ; tasker & tan 2009 ) . in order to interpret such data correctly",
    ", one must understand in detail how turbulence affects the ( in)stability of the disc .",
    "_ these facts all together motivate a thorough investigation of the problem .",
    "_    elmegreen ( 1996 ) assumed larson - type scaling relations , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and investigated the case @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "he found that the disc is always stable at large scales and unstable at small scales . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this was the only theoretical work devoted to the gravitational instability of clumpy / turbulent discs before ours .",
    "in contrast , several investigations focused on the effects of turbulence on jeans instability ( e.g. , bonazzola et al .",
    "1987 ; just et al .  1994 ; vzquez - semadeni & gazol 1995 ) .",
    "the goal of our paper is to explore the gravitational instability of clumpy / turbulent discs , spanning the whole range of values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 . among other diagnostics , we provide two useful tools for observers and simulators :    1 .   _",
    "the stability map of turbulence . _ using @xmath17 and @xmath18 as coordinates , we illustrate the natural variety of stability regimes possessed by such discs , and populate this diagram with observations , simulations and models of interstellar turbulence ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "2 .   _ a toomre - like stability criterion .",
    "_ we show that in our map there is a densely populated domain where the stability criterion is of the form @xmath1 , and determine the stability threshold @xmath19 as a function of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and of the scale at which @xmath20 is measured [ eq .  ( 17 ) and fig .  2 ] .",
    "if our criterion is fulfilled , then the disc is stable at all scales ( the case investigated by elmegreen 1996 lies in another stability regime ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 , we determine a dispersion relation that takes fully into account the scaling laws of interstellar turbulence as well as the thickness of the gas layer .",
    "we then surf through the various stability regimes .",
    "our toomre - like stability criterion is given in sect .",
    "2.7 , together with other important diagnostics : the most unstable scale and its growth rate . in sect .  3",
    ", we discuss the stability map of turbulence .",
    "we then make specific predictions about strongly and weakly supersonic turbulence . in sect .  4",
    ", we explore the densely populated toomre - like domain and illustrate the stability diagnostics in a number of cases , taking into account the saturation of density and velocity at large scales . in sect .  5 , we draw the conclusions .",
    "consider a gas disc of scale height @xmath21 , and perturb it with axisymmetric waves of frequency @xmath22 and wavenumber @xmath23 .",
    "the response of the disc is described by the dispersion relation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath3 is the surface density at equilibrium , and @xmath4 is the sound speed ( romeo 1990 , 1992 , 1994 ; see also vandervoort 1970 ) .",
    "so the three terms on the right side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) represent the contributions of rotation , self - gravity and pressure . for @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) reduces to the usual dispersion relation for an infinitesimally thin gas disc ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 2008 ) . for @xmath27 ,",
    "one recovers the case of jeans instability with rotation , since @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , scales comparable to @xmath21 mark the transition from 2d to 3d stability .",
    "note that we can encapsulate the effect of thickness in a single quantity and rewrite eq .",
    "( 1 ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective surface density . @xmath31 and @xmath4 are two important quantities , which we discuss in detail below .    _ the effective surface density . _ what is the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 ? since @xmath30 and @xmath33 , we find that @xmath34 if @xmath35 , and @xmath36 otherwise .",
    "this means that the observational counterpart of @xmath31 is the mass column density measured over a region of size @xmath37 . in the cold ism , which is highly supersonic and hence strongly compressible ,",
    "the amplitude of density fluctuations is typically much larger than the mean density .",
    "density fluctuations have a power - law energy spectrum , @xmath38 , which means @xmath39 ( see , e.g. , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "a power - law spectrum is then imprinted on @xmath31 : @xmath40 using the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 that we have found above , we can relate @xmath17 to @xmath41 : @xmath42 for @xmath35 , while @xmath43 for @xmath44 . in the warm ism , which is transonic or subsonic and",
    "hence weakly compressible , the density contrast is typically small so @xmath31 is dominated by the mean density , as in the limiting case of a non - turbulent disc : @xmath45 for small @xmath23 , while @xmath46 for large @xmath23 .",
    "hereafter we will omit the subscript ` eff ' , unless otherwise stated .    _ the sound speed . _",
    "the observational counterpart of @xmath4 is the 1d velocity dispersion measured over a region of size @xmath37 : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the thermal and turbulent 1d velocity dispersions .",
    "velocity fluctuations have a power - law energy spectrum , @xmath50 , which means @xmath51 ( see , e.g. , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "both thermal and turbulent motions tend to support the gas against gravitational instability .",
    "however , as pointed out by the referee , turbulent support results in relations that are true only in a statistical sense , with individual clouds collapsing even when the statistical criterion for stability is well satisfied . in the cold ism , @xmath4 has a power - law dependence on @xmath23 since it is dominated by @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the velocity spectral index . in the warm ism , @xmath56 deviates significantly from a power law since @xmath48 is no longer negligible .",
    "hereafter we will only consider the _ cold _ ism ( @xmath57 and cold hi ) , since in such a case we can explicitely take into account the power - law scaling of interstellar turbulence via eqs ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "we will regard the quantity @xmath58 introduced in those equations as the fiducial scale at which the mass column density and the 1d velocity dispersion are observed .",
    "this is also the scale at which @xmath20 and other stability quantities are measured .",
    "substituting eqs ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) into eq.(2 ) , we obtain the final dispersion relation : @xmath59    our phenomenological approach differs significantly from the traditional way to include turbulent effects in the dispersion relation , which is to identify @xmath4 with the typical 1d velocity dispersion observed at galactic scales .",
    "bonazzola et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , just et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , vzquez - semadeni & gazol ( 1995 ) and elmegreen ( 1996 ) adopted an approach similar to ours for investigating the gravitational instability of clumpy / turbulent media .",
    "( 5 ) is the starting - point of our stability analysis . as in the usual case , stability at all scales",
    "requires that @xmath60 for all @xmath23 .",
    ", where @xmath61 is the radial coordinate ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "this local condition is more restrictive than the natural requirement @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the size of the gas disc .",
    "since the condition above can not be rigorously included in the stability analysis , the usual procedure is to consider all @xmath23 and to check a posteriori whether @xmath64 or not . ] whether this requirement can be satisfied or not depends on the self - gravity and pressure terms , which now scale as @xmath65 and @xmath66 : @xmath67 @xmath68 in the following , we explore all the various cases .      here",
    "the self - gravity term is independent of @xmath23 ( @xmath70 ) , like the rotation term : @xmath71 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 increases with @xmath23 and tends to @xmath74 as @xmath75 .",
    "hence the sign of @xmath74 determines whether the disc is stable at all scales or not .",
    "stability requires that @xmath76 . for @xmath77",
    ", @xmath73 decreases with @xmath23 and tends to @xmath74 as @xmath78 .",
    "so , again , stability requires that @xmath76 .",
    "the stability criterion is then : @xmath79 eq .",
    "( 9 ) resembles toomre s stability criterion for cold discs , @xmath80 , but there is one important difference : eq .",
    "( 9 ) is a condition that must be fulfilled by @xmath81 to ensure stability for all @xmath23 , whereas the cold toomre criterion ensures stability for small @xmath23 .      here",
    "the pressure term has the same @xmath23-dependence as the self - gravity term ( @xmath83 ) : @xmath84 if @xmath85 , then @xmath73 converges to @xmath86 as @xmath75 and the sign of @xmath87 is equal to the sign of @xmath74 ( for @xmath88 , @xmath73 diverges as @xmath78 ) .",
    "hence stability requires that @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath89 , then @xmath73 converges to @xmath86 as @xmath78 and the sign of @xmath87 is opposite to the sign of @xmath74 ( for @xmath88 , @xmath73 diverges as @xmath75 ) .",
    "so , again , stability requires that @xmath76 .",
    "the stability criterion is then : @xmath90 the resemblance between eq .  (",
    "11 ) and the 2d jeans criterion , @xmath91 , is superficial .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( 11 ) ensures that the disc is stable at all , rather than small , scales .",
    "an analogous fact was noted in the context of our first stability criterion [ eq .  ( 9 ) ] .",
    "although this case seems the intersection of case 2.2 and case 2.3 , the stability criterion is not @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , this case is singular .",
    "the self - gravity and pressure terms are independent of @xmath23 ( @xmath94 ) , like the rotation term , so @xmath95 is constant : @xmath96 as @xmath74 is quadratic in @xmath81 , the inequality @xmath76 can be easily solved and the resulting stability criterion is : @xmath97 here @xmath98 and @xmath99 are related to the toomre wavenumber @xmath100 ( and to the jeans wavenumber @xmath101 ) : @xmath102 and @xmath20 is the toomre parameter : @xmath103 the @xmath104 case of eq .",
    "( 13 ) resembles the corresponding toomre stability condition , but see the remarks following eqs ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2 case is identical to toomre s criterion .      now @xmath106 and @xmath107 . hence the self - gravity term gets dominant for large @xmath23 and makes @xmath73 negative . for small @xmath23",
    ", @xmath73 is positive since it is dominated by the pressure term ( @xmath108 ) and/or the rotation term ( @xmath109 ) . as the zero(s ) of @xmath95",
    "can only be determined numerically , case by case , we do not give a stability criterion but note that the disc is _ unstable at small scales _",
    ", like a cold non - turbulent disc .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . so @xmath73 is dominated by the self - gravity term and is negative for small @xmath23 , while it is dominated by the pressure / rotation term and is positive for large @xmath23 .",
    "thus the disc is _ unstable at large scales _",
    ", like a non - rotating non - turbulent sheet .      when @xmath114 , the response of the disc is driven by pressure at small scales and by rotation at large scales , while self - gravity acts more strongly at intermediate scales .",
    "therefore this is a toomre - like case : @xmath95 has a minimum , which determines whether the disc is stable or not .",
    "more precisely , the minimum of @xmath95 provides three useful pieces of information : the stability threshold , the most unstable scale and its growth rate .",
    "such quantities are introduced below , while illustrative cases are discussed in sect .",
    "the stability threshold _",
    "@xmath19 is the value of @xmath20 above which the disc is stable at all scales : @xmath115 @xmath19 can be determined by imposing that the minimum of @xmath95 vanishes .",

    "_ the most unstable scale _ , @xmath120 , is given by the formula : @xmath121 where @xmath122 measures the stability level of the disc ( like @xmath20 in toomre s case ) , and @xmath123 is the value of @xmath124 at the stability threshold ( @xmath125 ) : @xmath126^{1/a}\\,.\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( 18 ) reduces to @xmath127 in toomre s case .    _ the growth rate of the most unstable scale _ , @xmath128 ,",
    "is given by the formula : @xmath129 which vanishes at the stability threshold .",
    "( 20 ) reduces to @xmath130 in toomre s case .",
    "even @xmath132 is a toomre - like case .",
    "in fact , although the scales at which pressure and rotation dominate are reversed , self - gravity still controls intermediate scales and @xmath95 has a minimum , which determines whether the disc is stable or not .",
    "this means that , even now , the stability criterion is : @xmath115 the stability threshold @xmath19 , the most unstable scale and its growth rate , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , are given by the same formulae as in eqs ( 17)(20 ) .",
    "the results of sect .",
    "2 are summarized in fig .  1 .",
    "the @xmath135 plane is divided into four regions , where stability  la toomre alternates with instability at small or large scales .",
    "the two shaded lines that separate those regions , and the point at which those lines intersect , represent transitions between different stability phases .",
    "thus the corresponding stability criteria are hybrid ( see sects 2.22.4 ) .",
    "the points @xmath136 and @xmath137 represent the limiting case of a non - turbulent disc and the case investigated by elmegreen ( 1996 ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this was the only theoretical work devoted to the gravitational instability of clumpy / turbulent discs before ours .",
    "1 also illustrates the most interesting stability regimes populated by models , simulations and observations of astrophysical turbulence .",
    "such points are discussed throughout the rest of this section .",
    "specific predictions about strongly and weakly supersonic turbulence are then made in sect .",
    "the mass - size scaling relation , @xmath138 , tells us the natural bounds of @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , @xmath139 is the fractal dimension of the mass distribution , which ranges from 0 to 3 , so we have @xmath140 .",
    "note that the upper bound corresponds to the case in which the destabilizing effect of self - gravity is scale - independent , i.e.  to the vertical shaded line introduced above .",
    "does even the other shaded line have a twofold meaning ?",
    "yes , and an important one !",
    "if the stabilizing effect of pressure has the same scale - dependence as the effect of self - gravity , @xmath141 , then @xmath142 , which is the virial scaling relation .",
    "gmcs are then expected to clump along that line , i.e.  to populate the transition regime between stability  la toomre and instability at small scales .",
    "for example , the well - known scaling laws @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( larson 1981 ; solomon et al .",
    "1987 ) correspond to the point @xmath145 .",
    "both galactic and extragalactic gmcs show non - negligible dispersion around that point , especially along the virial line , as can be inferred from bolatto et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and heyer et al.(2009 ) .",
    "the case of perturbed galactic environments seems different .",
    "rosolowsky & blitz ( 2005 ) investigated the physical properties of gmcs in m64 ( ngc 4826 ) , an interacting molecule - rich galaxy , and found @xmath146 and @xmath147 , which means @xmath148 .",
    "if such scaling relations apply to individual gmcs , as was originally suggested , then each cloud is far from being in simple virial equilibrium .",
    "besides , since @xmath135 is below the virial line and on the right of the @xmath149 line , the @xmath57 disc is unstable at large scales ( in the sense specified in sect .",
    "2.6 ) and the fractal dimension is formally higher than three .",
    "alternatively , one may argue that those scaling relations arise from the superposition of more gmcs , each one characterized by the standard scaling laws , but with proportionality factors varying significantly over the disc ( rosolowsky , private communication ) .",
    "now what about hi ?",
    "a turbulence model that is becoming more and more popular is the one introduced by fleck ( 1996 ) , which predicts @xmath150 . to understand the meaning of this scaling relation ,",
    "compare it with kolmogorov s law @xmath151 .",
    "fleck s relation tells us that in a turbulent medium with both velocity and density fluctuations the quantity @xmath152 plays a role similar to @xmath4 in incompressible turbulence .",
    "fleck ( 1996 ) assumed that @xmath153 , which means @xmath154 ( see sect .",
    "so his prediction corresponds to the line @xmath155 , which crosses several stability regimes .",
    "the limiting case of kolmogorov turbulence , @xmath156 , lies in the transition regime between stability  la toomre and instability at large scales .",
    "both high - resolution simulations of supersonic turbulence and hi observations populate the toomre - like domain .",
    "such simulations cluster along the fleck line , near @xmath157 , the case of burgers turbulence ( kowal & lazarian 2007 ; kritsuk et al .  2007 ; schmidt et al .",
    "2008 ; price & federrath 2010 ; see also fleck 1996 and references therein ) . in weakly",

    "the cases of kolmogorov and burgers turbulence correspond to @xmath156 and @xmath165 , while the virialization point is @xmath166 .",
    "the kitsionas line crosses the same stability regimes as the fleck line , but lies farther away from hi and gmc observations .",

    "this simulation is sub - alfvnic , like the first one above . ] in spite of the large uncertainties , it is clear that these points are on the left of @xmath194 and , on average , closer to @xmath195 . _",
    "thus _ strongly supersonic 3d turbulence drives the disc well inside the toomre - like domain , near the burgers point .",
    "let us now illustrate the stability characteristics of clumpy / turbulent discs in a number of cases , those marked with hollow circles in the toomre - like domain of our map ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) . the points @xmath196 , @xmath195 and @xmath197 are typical values of @xmath135 inferred from hi observations , high- and low - resolution simulations of supersonic turbulence .",
    "the points @xmath198 and @xmath199 are the contributions of density and velocity fluctuations to the observed @xmath158 . for each case",
    ", we proceed in two ways .",
    "first , we assume that the density- and velocity - size scaling relations are perfect power laws , as given by eqs ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , so that @xmath58 is the fiducial scale at which density and velocity are observed .",
    "we then evaluate the stability characteristics analytically using eqs ( 17)(20 ) .",
    "second , we consider more realistic scaling relations , which take into account the saturation of density and velocity at large scales : @xmath200 @xmath201 where @xmath202 is now the typical saturation scale .",
    "we then evaluate the stability characteristics numerically using the dispersion relation , eq.(2 ) , which we rewrite as : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the toomre parameter and @xmath205 is the toomre scale .",
    "2 shows the stability threshold @xmath19 , i.e.  the value of @xmath20 above which the disc is stable at all scales .",
    "the first curious result is that such a diagnostic is highly degenerate .",
    "for example , look at the cases @xmath158 and @xmath157 , which represent hi observations and high - resolution simulations of supersonic turbulence .",
    "they have @xmath206 ! why do such cases degenerate into toomre s case ?",
    "why does nt turbulence show up ? eq .",
    "( 17 ) gives us the answer : because the effects of density and velocity fluctuations cancel out when @xmath207 , i.e.along the line @xmath208 ( see the map ) .",
    "the cases @xmath209 and @xmath210 allow us to disentangle such effects .",
    "density fluctuations that saturate at a typical scale @xmath202 tend to stabilize the disc by decreasing the stability threshold : @xmath211 if @xmath212 , and @xmath213 otherwise . to understand this result , remember that such fluctuations reduce the self - gravity term in the dispersion relation by a factor @xmath214 [ see eqs ( 22 ) and ( 24 ) ] , and that self - gravity is destabilizing .",
    "velocity fluctuations have an antagonistic effect .",
    "they reduce pressure by a factor @xmath215 [ see eqs ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) ] , and tend to destabilize the disc by increasing the stability threshold : @xmath216 if @xmath212 , and @xmath213 otherwise .",
    "when density / velocity fluctuations do not saturate , their effect becomes destabilizing / stabilizing if the fiducial scale is small .",
    "3 shows the most unstable scale , @xmath133 , for two values of @xmath122 .",
    "remember that this quantity measures the stability level of the disc , like @xmath20 in toomre s case .",
    "so @xmath125 ( top panel ) means that the disc is marginally unstable , while @xmath217 ( bottom panel ) means that the disc is moderately unstable .",
    "in contrast to @xmath19 , @xmath133 is not degenerate .",
    "turbulence now has a significant effect in the case of hi observations , since the contributions of density and velocity fluctuations are no longer antagonistic .",
    "for @xmath218 , @xmath133 is about 30 to 50 per cent smaller than in toomre s case , depending on the value of @xmath122 . the impact of turbulence is stronger in the case of high - resolution simulations : the most unstable scale is typically half an order of magnitude below the expected value .",
    "turbulent effects become less important at low resolution .",
    "the growth rate of the most unstable scale , @xmath134 , is independent of @xmath202 and vanishes for @xmath125 [ see eq.(20 ) ] . for @xmath219 ,",
    "the effects of density and velocity fluctuations cancel out when @xmath220 , i.e.  @xmath208 .",
    "this degeneracy condition is the same as that found for @xmath19 , and has the same consequences .",
    "* observations and simulations of the interstellar medium are revealing its turbulent nature with higher and higher fidelity .",
    "such information must then be taken into account when analysing the stability of galactic discs .",
    "our contribution is a natural extension to toomre s work , which will prove useful for both low- and high - redshift analyses .",
    "* turbulence has a deep impact on the gravitational instability of the disc .",
    "it excites a rich variety of stability regimes , several of which have no classical counterpart .",
    "we illustrate this result in the form of a map , which relates our stability scenario to the phenomenology of interstellar turbulence : gmc / hi observations , simulations and models .",
    "* gmc turbulence drives the disc to a regime of transition between instability at small scales and stability  la toomre .",
    "toomre s criterion works instead typically well when applied to discs of cold hi , since the effects of density and velocity fluctuations tend to cancel out .",
    "even so , hi turbulence produces a clear signature in disc morphology .",
    "it reduces the characteristic scale of instability by 3050 per cent or more , depending on the value of @xmath20 and on the shape of the energy spectrum .",
    "the transition from hi to gmc turbulence occurs when @xmath221 and @xmath222 ( for more information see sect .",
    "* coming astronomical facilities such as alma will be able to resolve the scaling properties of galactic turbulence up to very high redshifts .",
    "using our map , such data will show up as _ evolutionary tracks _ , which will reveal the interplay between gravitational instability and turbulence during the galaxy life . in turn",
    ", this will be useful for constraining the sources of galactic turbulence and for understanding the evolution of cosmic star formation .",
