    "in string theory , there exist non - geometric backgrounds , called _ @xmath5-folds _ @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-folds are backgrounds in which the background fields on any two coordinate patches are related by transition functions which generally belong to the @xmath5-duality group . in other words , they are characterized by the property that as we go around a non - trivial cycle in the backgrounds , the background fields come back to themselves only up to the @xmath5-duality transformations . since the @xmath5-duality group is the symmetry of string theory , the @xmath5-folds naturally appear as the backgrounds of string theory .",
    "the @xmath5-duality group contains the @xmath1-duality group and the @xmath6-duality group as its subgroups , and @xmath1-folds and @xmath6-folds are defined in a similar manner .    in spite of the unusual properties ,",
    "there are many @xmath5-fold backgrounds in type ii string theory .",
    "the simplest example is the @xmath7-brane background .",
    "the circular integral of the ramond - ramond ( rr ) flux @xmath8 over a circle @xmath6 enclosing the @xmath7-brane is given by @xmath9 , so the value of @xmath10 is shifted by @xmath11 as we go around the @xmath7-brane . in other words , the @xmath7-brane background has the non - trivial monodromy @xmath12 , which is nothing but an element of @xmath6-duality group @xmath13 . in this sense ,",
    "the @xmath7-brane background is an @xmath6-fold .",
    "one might not be surprised at the @xmath7-brane example since the transformation connecting @xmath10 and @xmath14 is merely a gauge transformation .",
    "things get more interesting when we consider the case of @xmath1-folds .",
    "a simple example of @xmath1-folds @xcite can be constructed as follows ( although it is not a solution of supergravity ) .",
    "consider a flat 3-torus @xmath15 with constant @xmath16-form @xmath17-flux on it .",
    "we regard the 3-torus as a @xmath18-fibration ( spanned by coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) over a base @xmath21 with coordinate @xmath22 and periodicity @xmath23 ( see figure [ fig : t3 ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath20 is fibered on the base @xmath21 parameterized by @xmath22 . after taking @xmath1-dualities along @xmath19- and @xmath20-directions ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) ,",
    "the torus becomes non - trivially fibered on the @xmath21 , whose transition function is given by @xmath1-duality.,width=453 ]    in this background , if we parameterize the flux as @xmath26 with @xmath27 an arbitrary constant , the @xmath28-form @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 in a specific gauge .",
    "then , as we go along the base circle , @xmath31 , the @xmath29 field shifts by @xmath32 .",
    "this shift is again purely a gauge transformation .",
    "the shift becomes non - trivial if we perform the @xmath1-duality transformations along @xmath19- and @xmath20-directions . after the @xmath1-duality transformations the resulting geometry takes the following form :",
    "@xmath33 we can easily check that some components of the riemann curvature tensor are aperiodic and do not come back to their original values as we go along the base circle @xmath31 ( e.g. , the ricci scalar @xmath34 is aperiodic ) .",
    "this aperiodicity arises from the fact that the @xmath1-duality transformations mix the @xmath35-field ( which is aperiodic in the original frame ) and the metric together .    in type ii string theory compactified on a 7-torus",
    ", we can obtain many kinds of @xmath5-folds by taking dualities as shown in the left side of figure [ fig : web ] .",
    "note that all of these @xmath5-folds correspond to codimension-2 branes .",
    "-duality to each other , and those connected with a red line are related by an @xmath6-duality to each other .",
    "backgrounds of the branes in the left of the dashed vertical line are @xmath5-folds.,width=604 ]    here , the notation such as @xmath36 or @xmath37 indicates that the mass of the brane depends linearly , quadratically and cubically on the lengths of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the compactified longitudinal directions , respectively , and that the mass is proportional to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the string coupling constant .",
    "we note that there are , in general , several directions along which we can perform a @xmath1-duality transformation .",
    "for example , for a @xmath43 , taking @xmath44 leads to a @xmath45 , taking @xmath46 to an @xmath47 , and taking @xmath48 to a @xmath43 . here",
    ", the notation of @xmath45 indicates that the mass dependence of the @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 , and that of @xmath43 ( @xmath51 can also be denoted by @xmath52 ) indicates that the mass is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) are radii of the 7-torus .",
    "branes whose masses have such unusual dependence on the compactification radii and the string coupling constant are sometimes called _ exotic branes _ @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath49-background is known to be a @xmath1-fold @xcite , whose explicit form will be displayed later in eq .  .",
    "moreover , at least in supergravity theory , we can construct additional @xmath5-folds , which would correspond to the bound states of several 7-branes .",
    "the reason for considering these bound states is that we generally can not put only a single kind of 7-branes in order for the resulting background to be well - defined @xcite .",
    "we must put branes with other charges ( monodromies ) which are not related each other via @xmath5-duality .",
    "for example , a @xmath7-brane generally must accompany branes such as an _",
    "@xcite , whose monodromy is the @xmath6-duality transformation , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is axion - dilaton field .",
    "likewise , the @xmath0-brane must accompany other kinds of branes , one of which we here call a _",
    "@xmath58-brane _ , whose monodromy is given by @xmath59 .",
    "we will see the detail in section [ sec:522 ] .    given the above non - geometric backgrounds , it is then a natural step to study what happens when we put a probe on such backgrounds .",
    "when we drag the probe with charge @xmath60 around a brane with monodromy @xmath61 , the probe charge is affected by the monodromy of the brane on the way around it . after coming full circle around the brane , the probe charge eventually becomes @xmath62 one of our motivations in this paper is to investigate how the probe charge , @xmath63 , would vary in the course of traveling along non - trivial cycles .",
    "the codimension-2 objects with non - trivial monodromies appear not only in string theory but also in ordinary field theories as vortices .",
    "it was argued long time ago that certain gauge theories admit the existence of a vortex solution , called an _",
    "alice string _",
    "it has the property that a particle with charge of unbroken gauge symmetry changes the sign of its charge when it goes around the alice string ; @xmath64 .",
    "such an exotic property of the alice string has been applied into various fields in physics such as the cosmology based on grand unified theories @xcite , nematic liquid crystals and superfluid in condensed matter physics @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we put a fundamental string as a probe in some @xmath5-folds such as @xmath49 , and examine how the string behaves in such non - geometric backgrounds . in section [ sec:522 ] , we construct a @xmath5-fold background , which contains @xmath49 , by @xmath1-dualizing the 7-brane solution constructed in @xcite .",
    "we compare our construction of the @xmath49 background with that already known in @xcite .",
    "our construction gives some physical understanding , which was not made clear in @xcite .",
    "we also study the monodromies of the background .",
    "next , we construct fundamental string solutions rotating around @xmath49 in section [ string_solutions ] ( and that around @xmath58-brane in appendix [ sec : t34_string_solution ] ) , and study how the momentum and winding charges of the string , @xmath65 , transform under the action of the monodromy matrix of @xmath49 . in section [ sec : dft ] , we review the double field theory @xcite and the definition of the _ generalized lie derivative_. although the @xmath49 is not axisymmetric due to the action of the monodromy matrix , it is shown to be axisymmetric if we regard the background as a",
    "_ doubled geometry_. indeed , we find a _",
    "generalized killing field _ generating the axial rotation , along which the generalized metric is invariant . for the string solution given in section [ string_solutions ] ,",
    "the charge @xmath65 changes by @xmath66 with @xmath67 a constant matrix , after the string comes full circle . however , if we move to a coordinate system where the generalized isometry is manifest , then the charge density vector , which we denote by @xmath68 , is constant under the time evolution , that is , @xmath69 .",
    "conclusion and discussions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we first review the construction of the @xmath49 solution from the smeared kaluza - klein monopole ( kkm ) background by taking @xmath1-duality in a direction transverse to the ( smeared ) kkm @xcite .",

    "the periodicity of the 6-torus , over which the kkms are wrapped , is given by @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",

    "the integral is logarithmically divergent , and so we have introduced an ir cutoff @xmath83 for the integration . by introducing a `` renormalization '' scale @xmath84",
    ", we separate the divergence in @xmath17 as follows : is not unique , but this is not important for the discussion . ]",
    "@xmath85 where @xmath86 is the divergent term in the limit of @xmath87 .",
    "then , @xmath88 in is given by , for example , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the polar angle in @xmath91 .",
    "the aperiodicity about @xmath90 can be absorbed by a mere diffeomorphism @xmath92 .",
    "we obtain the @xmath0 solution by taking @xmath1-duality of the smeared kkm along @xmath78 .",
    "the result is given as follows @xcite : @xmath93 here , @xmath90-dependence appears in the metric on the internal 2-torus spanned by @xmath78 and @xmath94 , and these components are aperiodic under @xmath95 .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce the _ generalized metric _ in the @xmath78-@xmath94 space by the following @xmath96 matrix : @xmath97 where we defined @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    ". we can easily check that the generalized metric of the @xmath0 at each @xmath90 is related to its value at @xmath102 by an @xmath103 transformation as follows : @xmath104 we see that the monodromy matrix of @xmath0 , @xmath67 , takes the form neither of diffeomorphisms , @xmath105 with @xmath106 , nor of the gauge transformations of @xmath29 , @xmath107 with @xmath108 an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "it is a more general type of transformation which non - trivially mixes the metric tensor and the kalb - ramond field .",
    "an unsatisfactory point about the above @xmath0 solution obtained from the smeared kkm via @xmath1-duality is that the solution is not globally defined and is valid only for @xmath109 with @xmath110 . outside the domain ,",
    "@xmath17 given in eq",
    ".   becomes negative , which is obviously not allowed .",
    "in particular , the curvature scalar @xmath111 diverges at @xmath112 and @xmath113 , though in the intermediate region it will be sufficiently small to neglect any higher curvature corrections .",
    "the appearance of the cutoff , @xmath113 , originates from introducing the `` renormalization '' parameter @xmath84 , whose physical meaning is not clear , in the smearing procedure",
    ". we will clarify below that the cutoff parameter is to be interpreted as the distance of the @xmath0 from the other neighboring 7-branes .      the @xmath49 solution given in eq .",

    ". the finite - energy @xmath7-brane solution must contain several supersymmetric 7-branes ( which have their own monodromies ) other than a @xmath7-brane .",

    "<S> we perform a generalized coordinate transformation into a system where the generalized isometry is manifest , and show that the winding and momentum charges of the string solution is explicitly conserved in that system .    </S>",
