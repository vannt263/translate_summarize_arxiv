    "binary interactions play an important role in evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) models , and their inclusion can affect the overall shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of population .",
    "in particular , the sed in the ultraviolet passbands is bluer by 2 - 3 magnitude at @xmath0 1gyr if binary interactions are included .",
    "the bluer sed in the ultraviolet passbands is caused by those binary interactions which can create some important classes of objects , such as hot subdwarf b stars ( sdbs ) for a population older than @xmath21gyr ( han , podsiadlowski & lynas - gray 2007 , hereafter hpl07 ) and blue stragglers at 0.5@xmath21.5gyr .",
