    "amphiphilic molecules have many degrees of freedom in the structures they adopt .",
    "however , when the temperature and concentration of an aqueous solution of the amphiphilic molecules are fixed , the molecules are restricted to a certain molecular shape and aggregate to form a variety of mesoscopic structures , for example , micellar , lamellar and hexagonal phases .    in previous papers@xcite , we have investigated the amphiphilic molecule hexaethylene glycol dodecyl ether ( c@xmath9e@xmath10 ) , a popular surfactant in water that forms a variety of self - assembled structures .",
    "the phase structure of c@xmath9e@xmath10 was investigated by mitchell@xcite in 1983 . in our work ,",
    "we clarified@xcite the dependence of the phase structure on hydrophilicity by varying the interaction potential ( @xmath0 ) between the hydrophilic molecules and water in a dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulation using the jury model@xcite .    in the present paper , to determine the relative dominance of different microscopic interaction potentials in determining the mesoscopic phase structure , we investigated the dependence of the phase structure on the interaction potential between adjacent hydrophilic groups @xmath11 the details of the dpd simulation algorithm and models can not be included due to lack of space but are the same as reported previously@xcite with the exception of the interaction potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the differences with the previous simulation are described in section 2 .",
    "we used the same dpd model and algorithm@xcite as described previously@xcite , with a modification of the conservative force @xmath12 between particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 , given in the present paper by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is a position vector for particle @xmath13 .",

    "( [ eq.fc ] ) denote the coupling constants between particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath18 are given by table [ aij ] .",
    "to demonstrate the dependence of the mesoscopic phase structure on the interaction potential between adjacent hydrophilic groups , we varied the a - a interaction potential coefficient such that @xmath2 and @xmath19    the aggregation structure for each value of @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ st1 ] . to quantitatively classify the phase structure",
    ", we also plot the radial distribution function of the solute particles for each @xmath1 in fig .",
    "the figures show that hexagonal phases ( @xmath20 ) and micellar ( @xmath7 ) phases are formed depending on the coefficient @xmath1 of the a - a interaction potential .",
    "the distance @xmath21 between a hydrophilic group in an a - b dimer and another group in the nearest a - b dimer ( fig .",

    "[ gr](b ) .",
    "we plotted the dependence of the distance @xmath21 and the length @xmath24 on the interaction potential @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ ratio](a ) .",
    "figure [ ratio](a ) indicates that the dependence of the length @xmath25 on @xmath1 is weaker than that for @xmath21 .",
    "we also plotted the dependence of @xmath26 on the interaction potential @xmath1 in fig .",

    "the hexagonal and micellar phases correspond to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the packing parameter @xmath29 is considered to be proportional to @xmath26 . from fig .",
    "[ ratio](b ) , @xmath30 decreases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "therefore , it is found that a - b dimers form cylinders for small @xmath1 values , and that ab dimers modify their shape from cylinders to cones by increasing the distance between the neighboring head groups as @xmath1 increases .",
    "lastly , we compare the present results with our previous work@xcite , which investigated the dependence of the phase structure on @xmath0 . in that previous work , we showed that the a - b dimer modifies its shape with changing hydrophilicity @xmath0 .",
    "it is intuitively expected that the shape of the a - b dimer would depend more strongly on the parameter @xmath31 than the parameter @xmath0 , because @xmath1 affects the distance between the hydrophilic groups more directly than @xmath0 . however , contrary to our expectation , the present simulation results show that the dependence of the a - b dimer s shape on @xmath1 is weaker than that on @xmath0 . based on this result , we conclude that the solvent water @xmath8 plays an important role in determining the phase structure of the a - b dimers in aggregation .",
