    "the horn focuses positively charged particles into a 50 meter decay region .",
    "any charged particles that do not decay in the 50 meters are stopped by an absorber located at the downstream end of the decay region .",
    "the neutrinos produced in the particle decays then travel through approximately 500 meters of dirt before reaching the detector .",
    "the beam at the detector , assuming no oscillations , is very pure  approximately 99.5% muon neutrinos with a mean energy of approximately 700 mev @xcite .",
