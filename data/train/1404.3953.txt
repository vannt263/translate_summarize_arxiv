    "then we ask for the optimal protocol @xmath6 that drives the system from @xmath7 to @xmath8 such that the least amount of work is dissipated during finite time @xmath9 . in previous works",
    "this question has been addressed within two independent approaches : if full information about the microscopic properties of the system is available the dynamics can be described by a langevin equation @xcite , whereas phenomenological treatments rely on methods of linear response theory @xcite .",
    "generally , solutions obtained within the microscopic treatment are exact and valid for any kind of driving , fast and slow , strong and weak , whereas phenomenological treatments have been restricted to weak , slow driving .",
    "nevertheless , linear response results have been more promising as only very few examples can be treated analytically in the microscopic description . in addition",

    "the only processes that are fully describable by means of classical thermodynamics are quasistatic processes @xcite .",
    "such processes , however , are only of limited relevance for practical purposes as they are infinitely slow .",
    "moreover , they only describe situations , in which the state of a thermodynamic system evolves as a succession of _ equilibrium _ states .",
    "all real physical processes operate in finite time and are described by a temporal succession of _ equilibrium _ and _ nonequilibrium _ states .",
    "almost 20 years ago jarzynski achieved a major breakthrough by relating real , finite - time processes with their quasistatic counterpart .",
    "in particular he showed @xcite that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the work performed in a single realization of a nonequilibrium process , @xmath13 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath0 the free energy difference .",
    "the bar denotes here an average over an ensemble of realizations weighted by the probability distribution @xmath14 .",
    "in essence , the jarzynski equality allows to determine the work performed during a quasistatic process , the free energy difference , from an average over an ensemble of finite - time realizations of the same process .",
    "the jarzynski equality was verified in a conceptually simple biomolecule experiment @xcite .",
    "the ends of an rna molecule are attached to microscopic beads , which allow to pull the molecule apart . due to the internal structure of rna one observes folding and unfolding behavior . to study eq .",
    "the following experiment is performed : the rna molecule is brought into contact with the beads , and let to relax into its equilibrium state .",
    "then , the molecule is pulled apart , while the applied force and the length of the molecule are recorded .",
    "the thermodynamic work @xmath12 can be determined by basically evaluating force @xmath15 displacement. the left side of eq .",
    "is then simply obtained by running the same experiment many times .",
    "for the right side , however , one has to identify the quasistatic process . to this end",
    ", it is useful to notice that every reversible process coincides with a quasistatic process @xcite . in the rna pulling experiment @xcite a reversible process is identified if the force - displacement graph recorded during the unfolding process coincides with the graph recorded during the re - folding process .",
    "nonequilibrium , irreversible processes show a significant hysteresis in the unfolding - folding graph @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these experiments were run in finite - time , and even during the apparently reversible process small amounts of work dissipated into the environment . in the following ,",
    "our aim is to quantify these irreversible contributions . to this end",
    ", we will introduce and analyze the notion of a _ slowly varying process _",

    "note that generally @xmath20 describes the total system , which consists of system of interest and thermal reservoir .",
    "however , for the present analysis we only need that for all @xmath5 there is a well - defined equilibrium state , where @xmath13 is the ( inverse ) temperature of the heat bath .",
    "by @xmath5 we denote an external control parameter , as for instance volume , pressure , magnetic field , etc .",
    "work is performed by the system under study if @xmath5 is changed according to an externally predefined protocol , @xmath21 .",
    "it will prove convenient to write , @xmath22 where @xmath23 obeys @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is varied from @xmath26 to @xmath27 during time @xmath9 .",
    "for infinitely slow variation , i.e. , in the limit @xmath28 the work performed by the system is given by the free energy difference , @xmath29 where we additionally have , @xmath30 .",
    "the maximum work theorem , or more fundamentally the jarzynski equality now predicts that for all finite values of @xmath9 we have @xmath31 which means that for all realistic processes irreversible work @xmath10 is dissipated into the environment .",

    "the probability for a single realization is given by , @xmath33\\right)}{\\right\\rangle}$ ] , where @xmath34 is a trajectory in phase space @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath35 can be obtained from an average over all possible paths , i.e. , by a path integral average @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the average thermodynamic work @xmath36 can also be written as @xcite @xmath37 in the latter equation we introduced the notation @xmath38 to denote the nonequilibrium average , i.e. , the average over all paths of the observable @xmath39 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "is true for any kind of driving , slow and fast , weak and strong . for the latter analysis we call @xmath40 the generalized force .",
    "note , that this definition of a _",
    "generalized _ force is actually minus the _ mechanical _ force given by @xmath41 .",
    "this choice of sign is motivated by thermodynamic considerations .",

    "is equal to the variation of the internal energy of the total system composed of system of interest plus heat bath , i.e. , using hamilton s equations , eq .",
    "reads @xcite @xmath42 therefore , when @xmath43",
    "the external agent has performed work and hence @xmath44 , which agrees with the sign convention we adopt in the expression ( [ q05 ] ) for the second law .     in eq .  .",
    "[ fig0 ] ]    in the remainder of this section we want to find an approximation of @xmath10 for processes that are close to the corresponding quasistatic process .",
    "thus , mathematically we will have to find approximations , which express the state of the system being close to the equilibrium state corresponding to the instantaneous value of @xmath21 .    to this end",
    ", imagine that we can separate the process of length @xmath9 into @xmath45 time steps of length @xmath46 . during each of these time",
    "steps the time evolution of the protocol , described by @xmath47 , is then only allowed to change by @xmath48 for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 has to be small enough to employ methods of linear response theory for each interval . in complete analogy to the total process , @xmath51 interpolates between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and therefore fulfills the boundary conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "without loss of generality let us consider the first time interval , @xmath56 . in this case we can expand the hamiltonian for times @xmath57 in orders of @xmath58 and we have , @xmath59 in the latter equation we suppressed the explicit dependence of the hamilton on @xmath19 for the sake of simplicity of notation .",
    "we further had to implicitly assume that @xmath60 is a regular enough function in @xmath21 , so that the latter expansion is mathematically well - behaved .",
    "it has been recently shown that dissipation originates in the lag of the dynamical state behind its corresponding equilibrium state @xcite . in this context",
    "lag refers to the notion that nonequilibrium states generically relax into equilibrium states , if the driving is turned off .",
    "thus , nonequilibrium states can be understood to lag in relaxation behind equilibrium states . if the hamiltonian is modulated only weakly the real nonequilibrium state lags only slightly behind the instantaneous equilibrium state , and we can express the nonequilibrium average of eq .   by means of linear response theory @xcite , @xmath61 the angular brackets ,",
    "@xmath62 denote an average of an observable @xmath63 over the equilibrium state for the @xmath64th time step , @xmath65 equation   has a clear physical interpretation : the second term describes the _ instantaneous _ response , which is due to the observable @xmath40 being a function of the external control@xcite .",

    "so far we have only assumed that @xmath58 is small enough , so that the linear expansion of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "is a good approximation . to simplify the treatment",
    "let us further assume that @xmath74 can be approximated by a linear function in @xmath75 , which is justified for sufficiently small @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we have with @xmath77 @xmath78 furthermore , we assume that the relaxation function decays on time scales much shorter than @xmath76 .",
    "this is nothing else but an expression of the process under consideration remaining close to the quasistatic process at all times .",
    "a similar assumption is commonly employed in thermodynamics @xcite , for any systems which is only weakly perturbed .",
    "hence , we can write , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the _ correlation time _ , whose detailed discussion we postpone to sec .",
    "[ sec : corr ] . essentially , @xmath81 determines the time scale over which the response vanishes , i.e. , the system relaxes back to equilibrium .",
    "substituting eq .   with the expression   into the integral for the work   we obtain that during the first time step the work @xmath82 is performed ( where the integral in eq .   was calculated assuming @xmath76 very small ) .",
    "note that for the latter equation we approximated @xmath74 as a linear function , cf .",
    "eq .  .",
    "the task is now to identify reversible and irreversible contributions .",
    "it is easy to see that the first two terms can have either sign . in particular , reversing the arrow of time also changes the sign of the first two terms , but their absolute value remains invariant .",
    "one easily convinces oneself , that the first two terms also coincide with the free energy difference for the first time step .",
    "therefore , we identify the first two terms in eq .   as reversible contribution .",
    "the third term , on the other hand is always non - negative , and thus the irreversible work reads @xmath83 the latter result readily generalizes to the @xmath64th time step , and the general expression reads , @xmath84 it is worth emphasizing that the equilibrium state is updated for each time step , and that therefore the equilibrium averages in eq .",
    "are taken with respect to the _ instantaneous _ equilibrium distributions . in another words , we start each time step with an equilibrium probability distribution corresponding to a value @xmath85 . this can be understood as a consequence of the time - scale separation introduced in eq .  .",

    "it will prove convenient to re - write the total irreversible work in analogy to the work per time step as a functional of @xmath23 and we have @xmath93\\,\\mathcal{x}[g(s)]\\,,\\ ] ] which coincides with expressions derived in previous works @xcite .",
    "since the functional in the previous expression _ does not _",
    "depend on the switching time @xmath9 , the optimal protocols will be independent of @xmath9 , as well .",
    "moreover , sivak and crooks @xcite obtained an analogous expression with the friction tensor being here given by @xmath94\\mathcal{x}[g(s)]$ ] .",
    "as in their case , the optimal protocols obtained from are such that the power spent in the process is constant ( see appendix [ ap3 ] ) .",

    "generally , it is rather straight forward to determine analytical expressions for @xmath97 , whereas treating the correlation time is more involved . in particular",

    "therefore , we expect @xmath102 to be very small as the actual process deviates only slightly from the quasistatic one .",
    "it seems then natural to have the ratio @xmath103 as a measure of deviations from the quasistatic limit .",
    "we investigate in the following how this limit is achieved within our approach . intuitively",
    "the notion of a quasistatic process implies that the time derivative of the driving function has to be very small .",
    "equation indicates that if @xmath104 is negligible , i.e. , if the process is quasistatic , the work performed by the generalized force is simply the free energy difference .",
    "hence we have to demand not only @xmath105 but also @xmath104 to be small in order to stay close to the quasistatic limit after each time step .",
    "the question is how small @xmath104 has to be in order to fulfill these conditions .",

    "although the authors explicitly mention the range of validity of their approximations in ref.@xcite , they did not combine them to quantify how fast the system can be driven keeping eq .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that a similar separation of time scales was discussed earlier in the context of finite - time thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "analogously , a _ generalized thermodynamic length _ can be defined , which allows to measure the range of validity of the linear approximation more rigorously @xcite .",
    "linear response theory provides a phenomenological description surpassing the potentially involved determination of nonequilibrium states . instead",
    ", the thermodynamic properties of a system are described by the dynamical properties of correlation functions .",
    "for all systems , that are sufficiently coupled to a thermal environment , it is plausible to assume that correlations decay rapidly .",
    "this assumption expresses our expectation that thermodynamic observables evolve independently after short transients .",
    "more mathematically this assumption is supported by considering markovian dynamics , for which it can be shown rigorously that all correlation functions decay exponentially @xcite .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that the microscopic properties of the hamiltonian @xmath20 enter the correlation time via the equilibrium averages .    in the upper discussion we restricted ourselves to the simplest case , namely to an ansatz of only two free parameters",
    "this ansatz approximates the dynamics of the response function sufficiently well for short enough times . by sufficiently well we mean that eq",
    ".   fulfills eqs .",
    "up to second order . in appendix  [ ap2 ]",
    "we discuss various other anstze that include higher order corrections .",
    "as linear response theory is a phenomenological description , it allows for a certain freedom of choice. the exponential ansatz is motivated by the study of markovian processes .",
    "the ansatz in eq .",
    "is slightly more general as it , in addition , takes into account a transient short time behavior .",
    "its monotonic decay may correspond to a situation where the system is in a critical or overdamped regime ( see appendix  [ ap0 ] ) .",
    "if we wanted to describe underdamped motion , we would have to include an oscillatory component , see also appendix  [ ap2 ] . in general , the choice of the phenomenological expression for @xmath122 is motivated by the available information about the relaxation dynamics of the system of interest . on the other hand ,",

    "before we move on illustrating our findings with the help of analytically solvable examples , let us briefly comment on the significance of the nature of the thermal environment .",
    "generally , the total hamiltonian can be separated into system of interest and rest of the universe @xmath157 , where the control @xmath5 acts only on the system .",
    "it has been discussed at length in the literature that then the equilibrium averages of an arbitrary observable , @xmath158 , only depend on the system of interest , and the bath degrees of freedom are irrelevant in this respect @xcite .",
    "however , we will show in appendix [ ap1 ] that the nature of heat bath does manifest itself in the expression for @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the nature of the bath enters the analysis as higher order corrections .",
    "the remainder of this paper is dedicated to the explicit discussion of analytically solvable examples .",
    "we will start with harmonic potentials , before we generalize the analysis to anharmonic cases . throughout this section ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the ansatz .",
    "however , as we show in appendix  [ ap2 ] , non - exponential behavior as described by bessel and gaussian functions can also lead to the same dependence of the correlation time @xmath156 on @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the only reason to focus on is its simplicity compared to other expressions ( see appendix  [ ap0 ] for its physical motivation ) .      in this case",

    "<S> we investigate how to minimize the work dissipated during nonequilibrium processes . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we employ methods from linear response theory to describe slowly varying processes , i.e. , processes operating within the linear regime around quasistatic driving . as a main result </S>",
    "<S> we find that the irreversible work can be written as a functional that depends only on the correlation time and the fluctuations of the generalized force conjugated to the driving parameter . to deepen the physical insight of our approach we discuss various self - consistent expressions for the response function , and derive the correlation time in closed form . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our findings are illustrated with several analytically solvable examples . </S>"
