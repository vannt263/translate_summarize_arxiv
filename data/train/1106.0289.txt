    "different ways to measure quantum correlations have been widely studied in the last years @xcite . among these quantum correlations ,",
    "quantum discord @xcite has played an important role .",
    "based on the difference of two distinct definitions of the mutual information , ollivier and zurek developed a new measure of quantum correlations .",
    "this new feature of correlations was explored in its various aspects @xcite , intriguing the community by its peculiar properties - for instance , asymmetry and sudden changes @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that the entanglement of formation ( eof ) and quantum discord ( qd ) obey a very special monogamic relation @xcite .",
    "this important result gives rise to new operational aspects for quantum discord , such as the net amount of entanglement processed in a quantum computer @xcite , as the difference between the entanglement cost and entanglement distillation @xcite , and as the amount of entanglement consumed in the state merging protocol @xcite .",
    "differently from classical systems , a fraction of the quantum mutual information can not be accessed locally .",
    "based on this idea , other interesting operational interpretation of qd emerges - as a measure of the mutual information fraction that is not accessible locally or , shortly , the locally inaccessible information ( lii ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explore the properties of the lii to derive fundamental relations - we show that eof between any two subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 can always be written exclusively as a function of the lii .",
    "moreover it is possible to write the eof between two subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 as average lii of the pair minus the balance of lii of the pair with a purifying environment @xmath1 , giving to eof a new operational meaning .",
    "we derive several relations between eof and symmetrized and antisymmetrized versions of the lii that essentially quantify the average of the lii and the directional balance of lii , when measurements are made at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this allows for example to understand the difference between eof and qd for a bipartite system and elucidates important aspects of the entanglement sudden death .",
    "furthermore , we relate the qd with the conditional entropy in a simple manner for an arbitrary bipartite system .",
    "such a relation gives a new way to understand the negative signal of the conditional entropy .",
    "in classical information theory , the mutual information ( mi ) measures the amount of correlation between two stochastic variables , as measured by the shannon entropy .",
    "the same concept when extended to quantum systems , in terms of the von neumann entropy , allows the interpretation of the mi as the quantity of information shared by two quantum systems .",
    "it is generally accepted as the measure of the total amount of correlations ( quantum and classical ) of a quantum state . for a bipartite state @xmath4 ,",
    "the quantum mi @xmath5 accepts the extension of the standard form of the classical mutual information as @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the von neumann entropy .",
    "however the very definition of the mi , @xmath11 in terms of the conditional entropy @xmath12 shows that there may be a problem with this simple extension above .",
    "in fact this second definition of the quantum mi is measurement - dependent and so , dependent on which system the measurement is performed .",
    "thus from the start it seems that @xmath13 is not necessarily symmetric , i.e. , generally @xmath14 . moreover local measurement over a subsystem depends on the basis of the meter , and even with a good basis choice , generally the total mutual information can not be accessed .",
    "therefore a fraction of this mutual information is non - local , the so - called local inaccessible information .    given this peculiarity of a quantum system , henderson and vedral @xcite and , independently , ollivier and zurek @xcite defined a quantity that measures the maximum amount of locally accessible information @xcite , @xmath15,\\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the conditional entropy after a measurement in @xmath3 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the reduced state of @xmath2 after obtaining the outcome @xmath19 in @xmath3 and @xmath20 is a complete set of positive operator valued measurement that results in the outcome @xmath19 with probability @xmath21 . in this case , since a measurement might give different results depending on the basis choice , a maximization is required .",
    "thus @xmath22 is the locally accessible mutual information and gives the maximum amount of @xmath0 mutual information that one can extract by measuring at @xmath3 only @xcite .",
    "an illustration of that is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig001 ] ) , where the arrows represent the maximization involved in the calculation of the locally accessible mutual information .",
    "note that a fraction of the mi is not locally accessible because it can be divided in two terms : one given by the @xmath22 and another given by the lii .",
    "the lii is then given by the mi minus @xmath22 , which is exactly the definition of the qd , @xmath23 in other words , the qd above gives the amount of information that is not accessible locally by measurements on @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath24 , in fact , measures the difference between the conditional entropy given by the second term of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath25 , under optimal measurements @xcite on @xmath3 and the conditional entropy @xmath26 prior measurement , @xmath27 if @xmath28 all the available information about @xmath4 was acquired locally .",
    "so the qd has a strikingly simple meaning as a measure of how much a bipartite system state is affected by local measurements .",
    "in fact , the qd , @xmath29 , vanishes if and only if the density matrix of the composed system @xmath4 remains unaffected by a measurement in @xmath3 . in this case , all the mi between the pair is locally accessible . based on this fact",
    ", we can rephrase the definition of @xmath24 as _ the fraction of the @xmath0 mutual information locally inaccessible by @xmath3_.    while in @xmath24 the measurements over the basis that minimizes the inaccessible information are made over b ( meaning that it is the mutual information of @xmath0 that is inaccessible by @xmath3 , which is being minimized ) , in @xmath30 those measurements are made over @xmath2 ( meaning that the mutual information of @xmath0 is inaccessible by @xmath2 ) . indeed , there are states such that @xmath31 though @xmath32 and vice versa . by using the asymmetry of @xmath24 and @xmath30 , we can define two important quantities : the first one is the _ average _ of the lii when measurements are made on @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath33 and the second one is the _ balance _ of lii when measurements are made on @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath34 the _ average _ lii ( eq . ( [ polp ] ) ) is a symmetric function since @xmath35 and quantifies how much a system state is disturbed by _ any _ local measurement . on the other hand , the lii _ balance _",
    "@xcite is asymmetric and gives the difference in the efficiency that each subsystem has to determine the mutual information by local measurements , which in sense quantifies the asymmetry of a given bipartite state under local measurements .",
    "suppose , for example , that @xmath36 . in this case , a well chosen measurement in @xmath2 is more efficient for inferring mutual information of @xmath0 than a well chosen measurement in @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 has less lii than @xmath3 and this imbalance increases as @xmath37 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath38 , then measurements in @xmath2 are less efficient for inferring the state of @xmath3 than vice versa . as seen below , these quantities are very useful to uniquely relate eof to lii .",
    "to present the relation between eof and the lii , we begin by considering a pure joint state @xmath39 . in this case , qd is symmetric ( @xmath40 ) and is equal to eof .",
    "thus we can write @xmath41 where @xmath42 is given by eq .",
    "( [ polp ] ) , and so for an arbitrary pure bipartite state the eof is simply the average lii .",
    "now we extend our consideration for an arbitrary mixed state @xmath4 shared by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in such a case , a new subsystem @xmath1 that purifies the pair @xmath2 and @xmath3 must be considered . in this new situation ,",
    "an informational cost must be paid to include an additional subsystem - the exceeded knowledge that the environment @xmath1 has over the pair needs to be considered .",
    "as seen bellow , the eof for the resulting mixed state @xmath4 can not be simply written as in eqs .",
    "( [ pure ] ) . instead",
    ", it is given by the average lii of the pair ( @xmath43 ) minus the lii balance of each of the subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath1 . to prove this relationship ,",
    "let us suppose a pure state described by @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "we begin with a conservation relation for the distributed eof and qd derived earlier @xcite , @xmath46 rearranging eqs.([law1]-[law3 ] ) and writing them out in function of the average lii , given by eq .",
    "( [ polp ] ) , and the lii balance ( eq . ( [ polm ] ) ) , we can rewrite @xmath47 as @xmath48 we can see that when compared to the pure state version from eq .",
    "( [ pure ] ) the eof in eq .",
    "( [ eab2 ] ) decreases if the local measurements at the ancilla @xmath1 has less access to the mutual information with @xmath2 and @xmath3 than the subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 together .",
    "so the eof is not only given by the shared non - local information as in eq .",
    "( [ pure ] ) , but as well by the balance of the bipartite system @xmath0 lii with the ancilla @xmath1 .",
    "this relation allows an alternative interpretation of the he eof , which is independent on the number of system copies @xcite - _ the eof @xmath47 , for an arbitrarily mixed quantum state @xmath4 is the average lii of @xmath43 minus the lii balance between each subsystem @xmath2 and @xmath3 with a purifying ancilla @xmath1_. in simple words , the eof of the pair @xmath49 is their average lii minus the loss ( or gain ) of lii due to correlation with @xmath1 .    , @xmath3 and @xmath1 . ]",
    "we shall return to discuss the implications of eq .",
    "( [ eab2 ] ) soon , but first we must define another way to interpret how the lii is distributed in the system .",
    "since the quantum discord and consequently the lii functions essentially quantify the difference between the conditional entropy after and previous optimized measurements , it is useful to quantify the lii amount involved when measurements are made in a sequential closed form , _ e.g. _ @xmath50 . in that sequence",
    "the lii in the pure tripartite system @xmath51 , is computed by adding the pairwise qd contributions when measurements are performed on @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 to infer the mutual information of the pair @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , respectively , @xmath55 the resulting amount represents , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ flow ] ) , a clockwise , @xmath56 , flow of pairwise lii @xcite , and it represents how much the joint @xmath51 system state is affected by the sequential optimized measurements on @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 .",
    "reversely , the computation of the pairwise qds for the sequence of measurements @xmath57 represents a counterclockwise ( see fig .",
    "( [ flow ] ) ) , @xmath58 , pairwise flow of lii , @xmath59    through eq .",
    "( [ eab2 ] ) , we can extend eqs .",
    "( [ law1]-[law3 ] ) to see that , for an arbitrary pure tripartite quantum system , the sum of all bipartite eof is equal to the sum of all average lii , @xmath60 or @xmath61 so the sum of all possible eof between pairs @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 is the sum of the clockwise and counterclockwise flow of lii .",
    "but the difference between ( [ clock ] ) and ( [ countclock ] ) lii flows gives @xmath62 interestingly , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) is equal to the sum @xmath63 , which vanishes for all pure @xmath51 joint state @xcite .",
    "so , for pure states , @xmath64 and eq .",
    "( [ sum2 ] ) results in @xmath65 therefore , _ for a given tripartite pure state @xmath66 the sum of the pairwise eof between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 is simply given by the lii flow in a closed cycle .",
    "_ the implication of @xmath67 in terms of the lii balance is that @xmath68 i.e. , all the cyclic sum of the lii balance ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) vanish .",
    "this is simply a feature of the purity of the system - since the system is closed there is no lii missing , and so the balance is null . in other terms",
    ", the amount of information contained in the cyclic sum of the conditional entropies balance is not disturbed by local measurements . as discussed bellow this result is the basis to obtain the most fundamental expressions relating the entanglement of formation and discord .",
    "furthermore , it gives a very simple relation between the conditional entropy and qd .",
    "an intriguing aspect is the difference between entanglement and quantum correlation .",
    "once qd can be different from zero for separable states , it is usually assumed that it could include extra quantum correlations when compared to entanglement .",
    "for example , for a typically separable state of the form@xmath71 while @xmath72 , the qd vanishes if , and only if , the set of states @xmath73 is a set of orthogonal projectors ( with the measurements in b ) . on the other hand , for mixed entangled states , there are some situations where the qd is smaller than the eof .",
    "thus , a fundamental question emerges : what in fact measures the difference between them ? by using eq .",
    "( [ eab2 ] ) , we can write it as the difference between the eof and the qd as : @xmath74 and so exclusively in terms of the lii balance .",
    "notice that @xmath75 can be either larger or smaller than zero , once it depends on the efficiency of determining the locally mutual information by performing measurements on each subsystem .",
    "it is natural that depending on the quantum state @xmath66 , the efficiency that measurements performed in @xmath1 in order to determine the mutual information of the pairs @xmath54 and @xmath76 is different from the efficiency of measurements performed in @xmath3 to determine the mutual information of @xmath76 and @xmath0 ( as well as from the one where measurements on @xmath2 in order to determine the mutual information of @xmath0 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , the difference between the eof and the qd gives the balance of such an efficiency .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that due to eq .",
    "( [ law1 ] ) if @xmath77 is positive then certainly @xmath78 is negative and vice - versa .     ( blue arrows ) and concentrating in @xmath1 ( red arrows ) .",
    "the net result of these two flows is the difference between the eof and the qd for @xmath0 when measurements are made on @xmath3 . ]",
    "( [ dif ] ) tells that the eof and the qd differ by the amount of the lii balance in the system , but yet does not offer a clear meaning to it .",
    "this issue can be however clarified by the flow of lii as follows .",
    "as depicted in fig .",
    "( [ flow2 ] ) , all pairwise lii contributions in eq .",
    "( [ dif ] ) can be split in two forms .",
    "the first one is the sum of the qd with a initial measurement on @xmath1 and , subsequently , on @xmath2 concentrating on @xmath3 , @xmath79 , and with a measurements on @xmath1 concentrating in @xmath3 directly , @xmath80 .",
    "similarly to what we have developed previously we can define a lii flow from @xmath1 to @xmath3 as @xmath81 the second one accounts for the inverse flow of lii , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sum of the qds with a initial measurements on @xmath3 and , subsequently , on @xmath2 concentrating on @xmath1 , @xmath82 , and with a measurement on @xmath3 concentrating on @xmath1 directly , @xmath83 . similarly to eq .",
    "( [ liifrome ] ) , we define the flow from @xmath3 to @xmath1 as @xmath84 note that the definitions in eq .",
    "( [ liifrome ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ liifromb ] ) are asymmetric and so quite distinct from the cyclic lii flux given in eq .",
    "( [ clock ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ countclock ] ) . with",
    "that it is possible to write eq .",
    "( [ dif ] ) as @xmath85 _",
    "i.e. _ , _ the difference on the entanglement of formation and the qd for the pair @xmath2 and @xmath3 when measurements are made in @xmath3 , is the difference between the flow of lii from and to the purifying ancilla @xmath1 .",
    "this difference is the net , or residual , lii shared with @xmath1 . _",
    "similarly , we can write @xmath86 where the order of @xmath2 and @xmath3 has been changed to explicitly differ it from eq .",
    "( [ dif3 ] ) due to the distinct sequence of measurements , as depicted in fig .",
    "( [ flow3 ] ) . combining these last two equations , it is easy to rewrite a symmetrized form for them , which turns out to be an equivalent version of eq .",
    "( [ eab2 ] ) as @xmath87 where@xmath88 and @xmath89 the form of eq .",
    "( [ eab3 ] ) is appropriate since it is a symmetric accounting for the difference between the eof and the average lii for the pair @xmath0 .",
    "entanglement , as measured by the eof , is a typical correlation of quantum nature as well as the average lii , .i .e , the average amount of mutual information locally inaccessible by measurements on @xmath2 and @xmath3 . now the difference between these quantities for the pair @xmath0 is equal to the net flow of lii between in and out of the ancilla @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath90 accounts for how much the state @xmath4 is disturbed by measurements on the purifying ancilla @xmath1 and , similarly , @xmath91 accounts for how much the state @xmath92 is disturbed by local measurements on @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the net lii flux @xmath93 computes the asymmetry in this process .",
    "in fact , the asymmetry captures the notion that some extra local inaccessible information of the pair @xmath0 is being shared with @xmath1 , being the reason for the difference between @xmath47 and @xmath42 .",
    "indeed @xmath94 when the system is symmetric so that @xmath95 and @xmath96 . but",
    "the net flow of lii in and out the ancilla @xmath1 can vanish as well when @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "in such a case , even though @xmath99 , the eof @xmath47 is equal to the average lii of the pair @xmath0 .",
    "so , whenever the net flow of lii in and out the ancilla @xmath1 is null , even though there might be some lii for the subsystem @xmath0 missing for being shared with @xmath1 , it is compensated and so @xmath42 computes all the lii which is useful for nonlocal tasks as entanglement of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be .",
    "( blue arrows ) and concentrating in @xmath1 ( red arrows ) .",
    "the net result of these two flows is the difference between the eof and the qd for @xmath0 when measurements are made on @xmath2 . ]",
    "by using the relations here presented , we can investigate another important aspect of the distribution of the entanglement and the quantum discord in a multipartite system .",
    "we consider a four qubit system where two initially pure entangled qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 interact individually with their own reservoir @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "we suppose an amplitude damping channel at temperature @xmath102 k and we write a map to each qubit as @xmath103 where @xmath104 and identically for @xmath3 interacting with @xmath101 .",
    "we choose as the initial condition @xmath105 , which is an example where the phenomenon known as entanglement sudden death @xcite occurs . as one can observe by eq .",
    "( [ eab2 ] ) , the entanglement between @xmath0 suddenly vanishes when the average lii between @xmath0 is equal to the balance of the lii between the environment and each subsystem ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "actually , as soon as measurements over the environment allows more inference about the mutual information with the pair @xmath43 , their entanglement decreases . as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , when the entanglement between @xmath2 and @xmath3 vanishes ( entanglement sudden death ) , the excess of the knowledge that the environment @xmath1 has about the subsystem @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as measured by @xmath106 becomes equal to the average lii in a finite time .    to obtain the results plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , we analytically solve the dynamics of @xmath47 and the qd between each subsystem @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the whole environment @xmath107 . in this case",
    ", we use our relations to analytically calculate the qd for a system of dimension @xmath108 .",
    "for example , to calculate the qd between @xmath2 and the whole environment @xmath109 we have that @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the conditional entropy and both , @xmath47 and @xmath111 , can be calculated analytically by means of the density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "these results extend further the investigation from ref .  @xcite as it provides a way to calculate the qd and the eof for different partitions ( e. g. @xmath112 ) and for higher dimensional systems .",
    "indeed , the monogamic relation can be used to calculate the qd and the eof between two subsystems with dimension @xmath113 and rank 2 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is true because the extra system that purify a rank 2 density matrix is always a qubit - for example , given a qubit @xmath2 and an environment @xmath1 with dimension @xmath114 , a rank 2 density matrix @xmath115 can be purified in a density matrix @xmath66 where the dimension of the subsystem @xmath3 is always two .",
    "noting that @xmath0 is thus a system composed by two qubits , we have @xcite @xmath116 and @xmath117 eq .",
    "( [ monog ] ) shows that the eof between a qubit and a qudit for any rank 2 density matrix can be calculated numerically by means of the qd of the two qubits @xmath0 .",
    "more importantly , eq .",
    "( [ monog2 ] ) , shows that the qd between a qubit and a qudit for any rank 2 density matrix can be calculated analytically by means of the eof of the two qubits system @xmath0 .    , while the blue curve ( dotted ) shows the average lii @xmath42 .",
    "the cyan curve ( traced ) represents the sum of the balance lii between the environment and the pair @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath118 the average becomes equal to the sum of the balance and the entanglement sudden death occurs . ]",
    "based upon the previous results , we are able to obtain additional fundamental expressions relating the entanglement of formation and quantum discord as well as the conditional entropy . first of all , we combine eq .",
    "( [ eab2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqzero ] ) to show that @xmath119 these equations are the simplest expressions relating eof exclusively to qd .",
    "they show that the difference between the entanglement and the quantum discord is proportional ( twice ) to the lii balance of one of the subsystem with the environment . in eq .",
    "( [ minimal ] ) , we see that for an arbitrarily mixed system @xmath0 , when the subsystem @xmath3 is measured in order to know about the mutual information of the pair @xmath0 , some additional information is acquired about the pair @xmath76 , and so it needs to be taken in account ( @xmath120 needs to be summed ) .",
    "we also can derive explicitly an important result discussed in the previous section but in a simpler form : _ if the systems @xmath3 and @xmath1 are symmetric , we have that @xmath121 _ , which is a direct consequence of the fact that for this case @xmath122 .",
    "then , the quantum discord @xmath24 is equal to the entanglement of formation @xmath47 not only when the system @xmath0 is pure but also when the systems @xmath1 and @xmath3 are symmetric .",
    "the same is valid for eq .",
    "( [ minimal2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath24 is equal to @xmath47 not only when the system @xmath0 is pure but also when the systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 are symmetric . of course , if we have full symmetry between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 then @xmath94 .    by using the results above , we are able to find a very useful relation between the quantum discord and the conditional entropy .",
    "the conditional entropy is an important quantity in information theory that is intimately related to the entanglement distillation and irreversibility .",
    "in addition , it is fundamental in the state merging protocol @xcite . in this protocol ,",
    "given two parties @xmath2 and @xmath3 with a shared state @xmath123 , the conditional entropy measures the amount of quantum communication that is needed to transfer the part @xmath2 to the part @xmath3 such that part @xmath3 ends with the state @xmath123 , keeping possible correlations of @xmath123 with any external system .",
    "interestingly , the conditional entropy can be negative and this means that @xmath3 can obtain the full state @xmath0 using only classical communication .",
    "additionally @xmath2 and @xmath3 will be able to transfer quantum information in the future at no further cost @xcite .",
    "first of all , let us pay attention to the case of pure states . for a pure state",
    ", we can write the conditional entropy as @xmath124 as exposed above , @xmath30 measures the amount of mutual information of @xmath0 inaccessible by measurements on @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , @xmath2 can not transfer this information to the subsystem @xmath3 and consequently it is preserved for a future communication . in this sense",
    ", what could we say about mixed states ?",
    "to calculate the conditional entropy for mixed states , in terms of the lii , we use the relation @xcite @xmath125 and eq .",
    "( [ minimal ] ) . based on this equation , it is simple to show that @xmath126 it is clear now , observing equation eq .",
    "( [ entropia ] ) , what in fact happens for mixed states .",
    "as one can see , there is an amount of lii that @xmath2 shares with @xmath1 once it can not be sent to @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , since this information mutually belongs to @xmath2 and @xmath1 , it can not be used jointly with @xmath3 for further tasks .",
    "in fact , it has to be subtracted from @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , by using eq .",
    "[ entropia ] , it is easy to analyze the negativity of the conditional entropy , which depends on the balance of lii .",
    "the sign of the conditional entropy has an important meaning in important tasks like quantum state merging and entanglement distillation .",
    "again , as for the eof relations , more important than the amount of lii it is the balance of lii between the subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the purifying ancilla ( environment ) . by using the balance of lii , we are able to identify the signal of the conditional entropy . for instance",
    ", if the subsystem @xmath2 shares the same amount of lii ( independently of the amount ) with @xmath3 and @xmath1 , the conditional entropy is null , @xmath127 .",
    "if @xmath2 lii with @xmath3 is larger that the lii with @xmath1 , the conditional entropy is negative .",
    "obviously , @xmath111 is positive when @xmath2 lii with @xmath1 is larger than the lii with @xmath3 .",
    "to conclude , we presented alternative forms to interpret the entanglement of formation in terms of the locally inaccessible information functions .",
    "our relations based on average lii and lii balance demonstrate that the eof can be understood for a general quantum system exclusively as a function of the lii being shared .",
    "the concept behind lii flow when sequential measurements are made is an interesting one to understand the meaning of the correlation distribution when measurements are performed . in that sense",
    "not only the way a quantum system is affected by local measurements can be quantified but also the symmetry of such a system , under local measurements .",
    "an example of the usefulness of these new relations was given in the investigation of the yet not well understood entanglement sudden death phenomenon .",
    "also a deep discussion on the distinction between entanglement of formation and quantum discord in terms of residual flow of lii in and out a purifying ancilla is made possible .",
    "the relation of the qd to the conditional entropy is quite important for the understanding when the negative signal of the conditional entropy occurs .",
    "that is ruled by the qd balance between the environment and the system as well .",
    "we believe the discussion presented here may contribute further for the understanding of distribution of entanglement and quantum correlation in general for multipartite systems .",
