    "<S> this study presents the first direct and quantitative measurements of the nuclear momentum distribution anisotropy and the quantum kinetic energy tensor in stable and metastable ( supercooled ) water near its triple point using deep inelastic neutron scattering ( dins ) . from the experimental spectra accurate lineshapes of the hydrogen momentum distributions </S>",
    "<S> are derived using an anisotropic gaussian and a model independent framework . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results , benchmarked with those obtained for the solid phase , provide the state of the art directional values of the hydrogen mean kinetic energy in metastable water . </S>",
    "<S> the determinations of the direction kinetic energies in the supercooled phase , benchmarked with ice at the same temperature , provide accurate and quantitative measurements of these dynamical observables in metastable and stable phases , i.e. key insight in the physical mechanisms of the hydrogen quantum state in both disordered and polycrystalline systems . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable findings of this study establish novel insight to further expand the capacity and accuracy of dins investigations of the nuclear quantum effects in water and represent reference experimental values for theoretical investigations .    </S>",
    "<S> * toc graphic : * +   + _ keywords : _ deep inelastic neutron scattering ; ab initio path integral molecular dynamics ; particle momentum distribution + a large number of experimental and theoretical dynamical studies of liquid water near the triple point are available in literature@xcite nevertheless an full and accurate characterization of hydrogen dynamics is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is of vital importance for clarifying thermodynamic properties and the key to expand our understanding of some of the mysterious characteristics of water , supercooled water ( sw ) and glassy water , the latter being its viscous counterparts , known as amorphous ice@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear quantum effects ( nqes ) play an important role in water , ice and hydrogen - bonded systems and directly influence their microscopic structure and dynamical properties . in most of these cases , the hydrogen atoms are localized in potential well with pronounced zero point motion . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium hydrogen dynamics is reflected in the quantum momentum distribution , @xmath0 , a quantity which provides complementary information to what is garnered from diffraction techniques . due to nqes @xmath1(@xmath2 ) markedly differs from the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution , and is determined almost entirely by the quantum mechanics of the vibrational ground state properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this makes @xmath1(@xmath2 ) a highly sensitive probe of the local environment , fingerprinting any changes occurring both in the structure of the hydrogen - bonded network as well as in the local symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath1(@xmath2 ) together with the mean kinetic energy , @xmath3 , provide unique key insights into the hydrogen local environment to rationalize the puzzling feature of liquid water near the triple point . </S>",
    "<S> dins is the unique experimental technique that directly access the @xmath0@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic principles of data interpretation of the dins technique are based on the validity of the impulse approximation ( ia)@xcite which is exact in the limit of infinite momentum transfer , @xmath4@xcite . within the ia , </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic neutron scattering cross - section directly probes the @xmath1(@xmath2 ) of each nucleus in the target system@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many dins experiments have uncovered the hydrogen @xmath1(@xmath2 ) in a large variety of water systems showing how its line shape fingerprints the change in the hydrogen network . </S>",
    "<S> recent examples are dins in water and ice reflecting the breaking and distortion of the hydrogen bonds that occurs upon melting @xcite or the competition between intra and inter molecular nqes unraveled by measuring the anisotropy of the quantum kinetic energy tensor of d and o in d@xmath5o@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) studies of ice , water , sw and amorphous ices ( low density , high density and very high density ) measurements show that , in an harmonic framework , almost identical value of @xmath6 , the oh stretching component of the @xmath3 , are obtained : 98 mev , 100 mev , 100 mev and 99 - 101 mev , respectively@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is an indication that the nqes on the oh stretching frequency , @xmath7 , is weakly dependent in the temperature range explored . </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary dins measurements go beyond the harmonic framework and provide full directional components of the mean kinetic energy tensor@xcite .    from the theoretical point of view empirical flexible and polarizable models@xcite are not able to fully capture the small difference between the @xmath0 distributions of water near its triple point one observes in dins and ins experiment . </S>",
    "<S> first principles molecular dynamics such as open path integral car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( picpmd ) , unlike less transferable models , is a promising path for the exploration of these detailed features in @xmath1(@xmath2 ) and @xmath3@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular in a dins experiment on ice the quantum @xmath3 has been measured on ice at 271 k , and the observable has been used as a quantitative benchmark for electronic density functionals employed using a picpmd in the description of hydrogen bonded systems in _ ab initio _ numerical simulations@xcite . beyond ice , path </S>",
    "<S> integral simulation studies are employed to study diluted water phase such as supercritical water@xcite . in these cases experimental and theoretical predictions of @xmath3 are in satisfactory quantitative agreement . on the other hand discrepancies still exists between experiments and theory for liquid water at room temperatures and below . </S>",
    "<S> particularly significant is the excess of @xmath3 across the density maximum at 277 k and across the supercooled phase at 272 k observed in dins experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar excess of @xmath3 is also found in supercooled heavy water@xcite and highly pressurized sw@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of these experiments is still matter of debate . indeed in the case of sw at t=271 </S>",
    "<S> k an excess of @xmath3 , about 58@xmath8 ( 8 kj / mol ) higher with respect to the room - temperature result@xcite , seems to be incompatible with the experimental molecular structure of water . </S>",
    "<S> yet the proposed explanations are not supported by any computer simulation calculation or theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> very recent path integral molecular dynamics provide accurate results for nuclear momentum distribution and @xcite of water near the triple point . </S>",
    "<S> thus accurate dins experimental determination are advisable in order to allow an quantitative cross comparison between dins experimental and simulation determinations of the @xmath1(@xmath2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we present a dins study of water near the triple point to determine accurate measurements of hydrogen @xmath1(@xmath2 ) and hydrogen directional mean kinetic energy components , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the single particle dynamics in sw and ice at t=271 k and water at 300 k , is investigated employing new experimental and cooling set up . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement on ice is specifically recorded at the same temperature used in ref.@xcite in order to allow a quantitative benchmark with measurement on sw . </S>",
    "<S> the dins measurements are carried out on the vesuvio beamline at the isis pulsed neutron and muon source ( rutherford appleton laboratory , chilton , didcot , uk)@xcite . in the dins experiment </S>",
    "<S> we obtain , from each _ l - th _ detector , a neutron compton profile ( ncp ) for the hydrogen nuclei , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> these functions represent the hydrogen longitudinal momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> full details on dins formalism , detailed description of operation of vesuvio instrument , sample preparation and experimental set up , procedure of cooling and phase monitoring , measurements and data analysis are reported in the supporting information . </S>",

    "<S> a simultaneous fit of the individual @xmath18 spectra is accomplished using two parametric models for the @xmath0 : ( a ) a model - independent lineshape , hereafter named model 1 ( m1 ) and ( b ) a three dimensional anisotropic gaussian lineshape derived from a quasi harmonic model , hereafter named model 2 ( m2 ) . the latter is recently employed to reveal the local environment of hydrogen in polycrystalline ice @xcite , amorphous ice@xcite and heavy water @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the present value of @xmath26156 mev at 271 k in sw represents the most reliable experimental value obtained so far , since it is established through a benchmark measurement on ice at t=271 k , which is correlated with previous dins result on ice at the same temperature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 value in sw is found approximately 10 mev higher with respect to @xmath3 value for water at room temperature , corresponding to less than 7@xmath8 increase . </S>",
    "<S> results from sw and ice at @xmath12 = 271 k both show @xmath1(@xmath2 ) functions with an anisotropic gaussian lineshapes and directional anisotropic components of the @xmath9 tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 value in sw can be regarded as an upper limit , which can help to identify those theories that best describe and explain the behaviour of water and hydrogen bonded systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the present dins study provides a reference set of values of increased accuracy with respect to earlier measurements , yielding new and key insights in the three dimensional potential energy surface experienced by hydrogen in water near the triple point . </S>",
    "<S> dins confirms to be a a unique and sophisticated technique for the investigation the nqes in water . </S>",
    "<S> it is highly desirable to continue to expand the dins accuracy in order to further refine the cross comparison with the parallel increasing accuracy of path integral molecular dynamics . </S>"
