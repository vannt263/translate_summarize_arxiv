    "[ intro ]    many attempts have been done to find a wide but not too inclusive class of functions that can be defined `` special '' , where `` special '' means something more that `` useful ''  @xcite .",
    "the actual main line of work for a possible unified theory of special functions is the askey scheme that is based on the analytical theory of linear differential equations @xcite .",
    "however , a possible alternative point of view was established by employing considerations that belong to a field of mathematics seemingly quite far from them : the theory of representations of lie groups .",
    "this way was introduced by wigner  @xcite and talman  @xcite and later developed mainly by miller  @xcite and vilenkin and klimyk  @xcite . in this line ,",
    "previous papers by us shown a direct connection between some special functions and well defined lie groups .",
    "the starting point of our work has been the paradigmatic example of hermite functions that are a basis on the hilbert space of the square integrable functions defined on the configuration space @xmath14 . as it is well known in the algebraic discussion of the harmonic oscillator , besides the configuration basis , @xmath15 , a discrete basis , @xmath16  related to the weyl - heisenberg group @xmath17  can be introduced such that hermite functions are the transition matrices from one basis to the other .",
    "this scheme has been generalized to all the orthogonal polynomials we have , up to now , considered : legendre and laguerre polynomials  @xcite , associated legendre polynomials and spherical harmonics  @xcite .",
    "we discuss here the lie group properties of jacobi polynomials and wigner @xmath2-matrices .",
    "starting from the seminal work by truesdell  @xcite , where a sub - class of special functions is defined by means of a set of formal properties , we proposed a possible definition of a fundamental sub - class of special functions , called  algebraic special functions \" ( asf ) .",
    "these asf look to be strictly related to the hypergeometric functions but are constructed from the following algebraic assumptions :    1 .",
    "a set of differential recurrence relations exists on these asf that can be associated to a set of ladder operators that span a lie algebra .",
    "2 .   these asf support an irreducible representation of this algebra .",
    "3 .   a hilbert space can be constructed on these asf where the ladder operators have the hermiticity properties appropriate for constructing a unitary irreducible representation ( uir ) of the associated lie group .",
    "second order differential equation that define the asf can be reconstructed from all diagonal elements of the universal enveloping algebra ( uea ) and , in particular , from the second order casimirs of all subalgebras and of the whole algebra .    from these assumptions ,",
    "we have that :    * applying the exponential map to asf different sets of functions can be constructed . if the transformation is unitary another algebraically equivalent basis of the hilbert space is obtained . when the transformations are not unitary , as in the case of coherent states , sets with different properties are found ( like overcomplete sets ) .",
    "* the asf are also a basis of an appropriate set of @xmath9functions and of an appropriate hilbert space functions .",
    "this , combined with the above properties , implies that the vector space of the operators operating on @xmath9 ( or hilbert ) space functions is homomorphic to the uea built on the algebra .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that hermite , laguerre and legendre polynomials are asf such that the hermite functions support a uir of the weyl - heisenberg group @xmath17 with casimir @xmath18 , while laguerre functions and legendre polynomials are both bases for the uir of @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "since hermite functions are a basis of square - integrable functions defined on the real line , as well as laguerre functions on the semi - line and legendre polynomials on the finite interval  @xcite , all operators acting on such @xmath9functions can be written inside the universal enveloping algebra ( uea ) of @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "all these properties have been shown to not be restricted to the above mentioned 1-rank algebras ( and groups ) .",
    "indeed in @xcite associated legendre polynomials and spherical harmonics are shown to share the same properties with underlying lie group @xmath23 that is of rank 2 like two , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are the label parameters of these functions .    here",
    "we present a further confirmation of this scheme in terms of the jacobi polynomials and wigner @xmath2-matrices showing that they satisfy the required conditions to be considered asf and share the same properties .",
    "indeed they can be associated to well defined `` algebraic jacobi functions '' ( ajf ) that support a uir of @xmath0 i.e. , a lie group of rank 3 like three are the parameters , @xmath26 , of the jacobi polynomials @xmath1 and three @xmath27 are also the ones of @xmath28 matrices .    from an applied point of view for both , ajf and wigner @xmath2matrices ,",
    "the relevant group chains are @xmath29 to consider together integer and half - integer spin @xmath8 and @xmath30 to describe them separately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ algebraicjacobifunctions ] is devoted to present the main properties of the ajf relevant for our discussion and their relations with the wigner @xmath2-matrices . in section",
    "[ sua(2)otimessub(2 ) ] we study the symmetries of the ajf that keep invariant the principal parameter @xmath8 and change @xmath31 and/or @xmath32 .",
    "we prove that these ladder operators determine a @xmath33 algebra , that allows us to build up a family of uir of the group @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 . in section  [ su11groups ]",
    "we construct , by means of four new sets of ladder operators that change the three parameters @xmath36 and @xmath32 in @xmath37 , each of them generating a @xmath22 algebra to which infinitely many uir s of @xmath5  supported by the ajf  are associated . in sect .",
    "[ su22section ] we show that the ladder operators , obtained in previous sections , span a @xmath4 lie algebra and the ajf and wigner @xmath2-matrices generate a uir of @xmath0 characterized by the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir @xmath38 .",
    "next section shows the ajf and wigner @xmath2matrices with labels all integers and half - integers can be classified in different and disconnected uir representations of @xmath5 or @xmath23 . in section  [ operatorsl2 ] the homomorphism between the space of the operators on the @xmath9 space and the uea of @xmath4",
    "is discussed .",
    "finally some conclusions and comments are included .",
    "a previous unpublished version of this work containing part of the results here presented can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ algebraicjacobifunctions ]    we consider the jacobi polynomials , @xmath1 , of degree @xmath39 as defined in terms of the hypergeometric functions @xmath40 @xcite by [ j ] j_n^(,)(x)=_2f_1 , where @xmath41 is the pochhammer symbol , or equivalently by @xcite [ jj ] j_n^(,)(x)=()^n_2f_1 . from an explicit polynomial expression",
    "can be obtained @xcite [ jjj ] j_n^(,)(x)= _ s=0^n (    c n+ + s    ) (    c n+ + n - s    ) ( ) ^s()^n - s . where we have considered a generalized binomial coefficient @xmath42 being @xmath43 an arbitrary number and @xmath44 a positive integer .",
    "however to obtain objects related to an algebraic structure like in @xcite , we define -alternatively to @xmath45- three other ( discrete ) variables and include an @xmath46-depending factor .",
    "we first substitute @xmath47 with @xmath48 @xmath49 hence @xmath50 then , in a second and final step , we include a @xmath46-depending factor related with the integration measure of the jacobi polynomials .",
    "so , the fundamental objects of this paper , we call `` algebraic jacobi functions '' ( ajf ) , have the final form [ ajf ] j_j^m , q(x):= ( ) ^ ( ) ^ j_j - m^(m+q , m - q)(x ) ,    where in order to obtain a group representation , as we will prove later , we have to impose the following restrictions for @xmath27 [ conditions ] j|m| , j|q| , 2j , j - m , j - q hence , @xmath27 are all together integers or half - integers ( see fig .",

    "it is worthy noticing that the ajfs , with the substitution @xmath67 , are essentially the elements of the wigner @xmath2 rotation matrices  @xcite @xmath68 that verify the conditions .",

    "the algebra is now the construction of the rising / lowering differential operators that change the labels @xmath27 of the ajf by 1 or 1/2 .",
