    "the measurement of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is important for vhe gamma - ray astronomy as well as for astronomers modeling star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "second only in intensity to the cosmic microwave background , the optical and infrared ( ir ) ebl contains the imprint of galaxy evolution since the big bang .",

    "the optical to far - infrared ebl is difficult to measure because it is dwarfed by the much brighter foregrounds caused by night - sky glow , diffuse dust in the galaxy , and the zodiacal light caused by interplanetary dust @xcite .",
    "for example , emission by the zodiacal dusk peaks in the 25 @xmath2 m  region , orders of magnitude above the low ebl density in this waveband . in the case of ground- or rocket - based observations ,",
    "instrumental emission also plays a significant role .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that the only characteristic upon which a detection of the ebl can be based is that it has to be distributed isotropically .",
    "these difficulties have precluded ground- and rocket - based measurements from detecting the ebl at all @xcite .",
    "the measured flux of vhe gamma rays is attenuated by pair production with optical / ir photons .",
    "on extragalactic distances , most of this absorption occurs by the ebl @xcite ; interactions with stellar and galactic material and optical / ir photons are negligible @xcite .",
    "thus , if one somehow knows the initial gamma - ray flux , vhe astronomy is in a unique position to place limits on the density of the intervening optical / ir component of the ebl .",

    "[ fig : ebl_ir ] . the possible detections at 60 @xmath2 m  and 100 @xmath2 m   @xcite are viewed as too high and are controversial , requiring revised galaxy evolution models with larger dust content @xcite .",

    "the isotropic optical and near - ir emission detected with the japanese irts satellite is considerably higher than integrated light from galaxies and theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "lower limits on the ebl density are placed by adding the flux per unit area received from all galaxies down to a given flux limit .",
    "as galaxies are only one source contributing to the ebl , these galaxy counts represent a lower limit on the total ebl @xcite . in the mid - ir region , where the foreground is particularly bright , @xcite were able to place a lower limit on the 15 @xmath2 m  ebl density .",
    "upper limits can be placed on the ebl from direct measurements with minimal background subtraction @xcite .",
    "also , upper limits can be derived from fluctuations in the measured light distribution , see @xcite .",
    "bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects are one type of active galactic nuclei that have a jet of high energy particles aligned with our line of sight .",
    "the nonthermal emission from the jet is highly variable and the mechanism for production of the vhe gamma - ray peak is under debate . in all models",
    "the intrinsic vhe spectrum of the source is smooth and concave downwards ; no physical mechanism has been proposed that would produce an exponential rise with energy or emission - like line features . the vhe spectrum measured on earth",
    "is modified by interactions of gamma rays with the ebl .",
    "for example , a 1 tev gamma ray reaches the threshold for electron - positron pair production if it collides with a 1 ev optical photon .",
    "if a pair is created , this gamma ray is lost and causes an attenuation of the measured spectrum at that energy .",
    "thus , the ebl density could be inferred from the measured spectrum if the intrinsic spectrum of the blazar were known .",
    "in addition , because of the coarse energy resolution of this method , a measurement of the ebl spectrum is only possible if the shape of the ebl spectrum is known in advance .",
    "three methods have been used so far to derive ebl limits :    1 .   using multiwavelength observations ,",
    "the intrinsic vhe blazar spectrum is predicted through interpolation or fitting of an emission model .",

    "the intrinsic source spectrum is reconstructed .",
    "ebl models are ruled out , or limits are placed on the density , if they give rise to an unphysical source spectrum : such as that it must not rise exponentially and that it should be consistent with the x - ray synchrotron peak @xcite .",
    "the method described in this paper differs from the above in that : ( 1 ) the intrinsic source spectrum of all detected vhe blazars is assumed to be identical to each other .",
    "a conservative upper limit to the intrinsic spectrum is interpolated from the observed correlation between the spectral index of the source during a flare state and its redshift .",
    "( 2 ) upper limits to the ebl intensity are calculated only at single energy points where the vhe spectrum has been measured , avoiding the need to specify the ebl spectral shape .",

    "it is possible that the reason for this similarity lies in the fact that only the brightest vhe blazars are seen by the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes at this time and that there is actually a continuous population of blazar spectra @xcite .",

    "( 2 ) the density of ebl photon with a single wavelength was found that reproduces the measured optical depth at a given gamma - ray energy .",
    "the ebl wavelength was fixed so that the pair production is most efficient , requiring the smallest density of ebl photons . ( 3 ) the derived monochromatic ebl density represents an upper limit to the true ebl density . the true ebl spectrum is extended and absorption of a gamma ray is produced by ebl photons over a range of wavelengths , thereby requiring a lower density than a monoenergetic ebl to produce the same optical depth .",
    "the optical depths measured from the six blazars fall in line with predictions from a range of ebl models .",

    "[ fig : ebl_models ] to represent an average of the allowed ebl scenarios , and the limits derived from the model and the measurements are in agreement .",
    "the constraining power of the upper limits depends on the ebl spectrum : if the spectrum is steeply falling with wavelength , the upper limits are more conservative at shorter wavelength than if the ebl spectrum is flat .",
    "the unambiguous and statistically correct determination of 98% ci upper limits from combining the results of the six blazars is difficult because an average intrinsic blazar spectrum was used , derived from the observed spectral steepening with redshift .",
    "the upper limits derived here should be considered as a whole and not from one blazar alone .",
    "the derived upper limits question one particular set of ebl measurements @xcite that are very high in the near infrared waveband and which galaxy formation models are typically not able to reproduce either .    in principle",
    ", one could extend the method described here to derive more constraining upper limits on the ebl density by reiterating a process of calculating upper limits and then using the upper - limit spectrum as an input to a second iteration of calculating upper limits .",
    "to do better and measure the ebl density , requires accurate knowledge of the intrinsic and the absorbed source spectra over at least two decades of energy .",
    "reduced error bars on the measured spectrum will be achieved with the new generation of telescopes coming online now .",
    "however , the mechanism for production of vhe gamma rays , and hence the intrinsic source spectrum , is still under considerable debate .",
    "unless a theoretical model is accepted or a `` standard candle '' at cosmological distances is identified with a well understood gamma - ray spectrum , the spectra from all these sources will only provide upper limits on the ebl flux . only through further observation at all wavelengths",
    "will the gamma - ray production mechanism be understood .",
    "the glast satellite , to be launched in 2006 , will cover the energy range from 0.1 - 100 gev .",
    "together with the low threshold of about 100 gev for the new arrays of imaging cherenkov telescope such as hess , veritas , and cangaroo , simultaneous flux measurements can be performed over almost six decades in energy .",
