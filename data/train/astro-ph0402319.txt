    "this problem may be exacerbated if the imf is top - heavy or the metallicity low , since the ionizing photon production rate will be higher making any emission line yet more prominent ( c.f .",
    "malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .    an alternative explanation for the absence of lyman @xmath14 emission may be incomplete reionization at @xmath57 .",
    "neutral hydrogen can scatter lyman  @xmath14 photons after they have escaped the ism of the emitting galaxy ( e.g. , miralda - escude & rees 1998 ) .",
    "if the source were embedded in a neutral zone , even a strong lyman  @xmath14 emission line emitted from the galaxy could be quenched .",
    "however , in such cases , simulations suggest that emission can still be observed even from sources embedded in fully neutral zones , depending on details of the many relevant parameters of the source ( haiman 2002 , santos 2003 ) .",
    "since the universe is only  750 myr old at @xmath75 , the total stellar mass is unlikely to exceed @xmath76  m@xmath72 .",
    "halos of mass @xmath77m@xmath72 at @xmath57 are quite consistent with conventional structure formation models ( barkana & loeb 2002 ) and sufficient to supply baryons to sustain the observed star formation rate .",
    "the instantaneous baryonic accretion rate for such a halo at @xmath75 is , on average , 4.4  m@xmath72yr@xmath10 ( e.g. lacey & cole 1993 ) , so even if an earlier starburst consumed most of the baryons , they can be rapidly replenished .",
    "although we have no constraints on the actual star - formation history , these arguments emphasize that we are not necessarily viewing the system at a special time in its evolution .",
    "the strong magnification ( @xmath78 ) of the two brighter images gives us our first glimpse into the morphological structure of a very distant source on sub - kpc scales .",
    "both images @xmath25 and @xmath26 have a bright core , a second fainter knot , and extended emission of lower surface brightness ( figure  1 ) .",
    "there is no noticeable color gradient .",
    "our mass model for abell 2218 implies magnifications of @xmath79 along the major axis of images @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath80 along the minor axis .",
    "the @xmath81 width of the f850lp psf translates into a physical resolution of @xmath39470  pc along the minor axis and @xmath3950  pc along the major axis .",
    "we thus infer that the source ( observed with 3.6@xmath82 ) has a maximum physical size of 1.2  kpc by @xmath74500  pc .",
    "the maximal associated area of 0.6  kpc@xmath83 indicates a star - formation surface density in excess of 4.3  m@xmath72yr@xmath10kpc@xmath84 . the bright knot is only 100  pc across implying a star - formation surface density in the range @xmath3950 - 250  m@xmath72yr@xmath10kpc@xmath84 depending on the exact geometry , comparable to the most intense starburst activity observed locally ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "if this source is typical of those which reionized the universe in a narrow time interval of @xmath85=1 around @xmath57 , we can estimate the expected surface density from the arguments presented by stiavelli et al ( 2003 ) . depending on the source temperature , lyman continuum escape fraction and clumpiness of the igm",
    ", we would deduce surface densities @xmath860.3 - 5 arcmin@xmath84 are necessary . in as much as it is possible to estimate the actual surface density from one source and the limited area examined by looking through only one cluster lens to find it , we find a number density of @xmath87 arcmin@xmath84 .    in conclusion",
    ", we present evidence that we have found a highly magnified source which lies beyond @xmath88 , possibly at @xmath57 .",
    "even in advance of the infrared capabilities of _ jwst _ , further observation of this source will be important in determining a more secure redshift , and improving the constraints on the slope of the uv continuum .",
    "further spectroscopy in the 9200-1@xmath40 m region would be valuable to probe any lyman  @xmath14 emission at @xmath56.8 ( figure 4 ) and to confirm ( or otherwise ) the significance of the weak continuum drop seen in the nirspec data at 9800  .",
    "the location of the gunn - peterson trough might also be verified more precisely via narrow band imaging through gaps in oh forest and with a deep acs grism spectroscopy .    notwithstanding",
    "the need for further work and regardless of its precise redshift in the constrained window 6.6@xmath457.1 , our source appears to be a star - forming galaxy with intriguing spectral properties , possibly representative of a new population responsible for ending cosmic reionization .",
    "while our discovery highlights many of the challenges facing searches for those @xmath186.5 galaxies responsible for reionization , it also demonstrates the ability of strong lensing by clusters of galaxies to locate and reveal the detailed properties of high redshift sources . the lensed galaxy presented in this paper ,",
    "if observed unlensed at @xmath89 would lie at the detection limit of the upcoming udf observation and no spectroscopic follow - up would have been possible .",
