    "the static properties of baryons constitute an important test for theoretical descriptions in the non - perturbative domain of qcd . in particular , different predictions for the magnetic moments of baryons were made in quark - models , chiral quark soliton models , and lattice qcd calculations ( see e.g. ref .",
