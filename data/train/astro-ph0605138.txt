    "corotation resonances play an essential role in the gravitational interaction between a planet and the disc in which it forms . the perturbing potential associated with a planet ( or other satellite ) orbiting in a disc can be decomposed into a series of fourier components with different azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath0 and angular frequencies @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a fluid element in the disc at radius @xmath2 , where the angular velocity is @xmath3 , experiences a perturbing force with doppler - shifted frequency @xmath4 .",
    "resonant responses to horizontal forcing occur at radial locations where @xmath5 ( the corotation resonance ) and @xmath6 ( lindblad resonances ) , where @xmath7 is the epicyclic frequency in the disc . under certain assumptions , including a linear approximation , simple formulae can be obtained for the localized resonant torques exerted at these locations ( * ? ? ? * hereafter gt79 ) .",
    "the associated exchanges of angular momentum and energy cause the orbital parameters of the planet , in particular its semimajor axis and eccentricity , to evolve , and also play a role in shaping the mass distribution in the disc .",
    "these processes are of fundamental importance in determining the properties of planetary systems .    in a linear analysis the torque exerted at a corotation resonance",
    "is found to be proportional to the local radial gradient of vortensity ( i.e.  vertical vorticity divided by surface density ) . however , the perturbed flow in the corotation region has islands of libration within which fluid is trapped and corotates , on average , with the potential .",
    "the mixing within these islands tends to erase the gradient of vortensity and reduce the corotation torque to zero @xcite . the resonance is then said to be completely saturated .",
    "since viscous diffusion tends to reestablish the vortensity gradient , the level of saturation achieved in a steady state depends on the strength of the forcing and the viscosity .",
    "this behaviour is in contrast to that of lindblad resonances , where the torque is insensitive to nonlinearity @xcite and can be reduced significantly only by removing mass from the resonant region .    in the case of a planet with a circular orbit , the angular pattern speed @xmath8 of each non - axisymmetric potential component is equal to the angular velocity of the planet , and the corotation resonances are all _ coorbital _ , occurring at ( very nearly ) the same radial location as the planet s orbit .",
    "the coorbital corotation resonance is difficult to treat analytically because of the simultaneous presence of resonant components of all azimuthal wavenumbers and the high degree of nonlinearity .",
    "it is also in this region that three - dimensional effects are most important .",
    "the presence of a gap or partial clearing around the planet s orbit , together with shocks and accretion streams , complicates the problem further .",
    "an important study by @xcite presented an asymptotic reduction of the coorbital region , allowing for a modest degree of nonlinearity , to a more tractable problem requiring the numerical solution of a partial differential equation . the time - evolution of the solution shows the formation of transient vortices followed by a mixing of vortensity across the corotation region , resulting in a saturation of the corotation torque .",
    "some recent direct numerical simulations of the interaction between a mobile planet and a disc have drawn attention to the importance of the coorbital region .",
    "@xcite found that very fast migration of a saturn - mass protoplanet could occur in a disc somewhat more massive than the minimum - mass solar nebula .",
    "they presented a simplified analytical model allowing them to estimate the torque exerted by gas that crosses the planet s orbit as the planet migrates radially through the disc .",
    "since this torque is proportional to the migration rate , it modifies ( and typically reduces ) the effective inertial mass of the planet , allowing it to migrate faster in response to non - coorbital torques .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested that , if the effective inertial mass became negative and a time delay also occurred in its determination , the radial motion could be unstable and give rise to very fast ( and generally inward ) ` runaway ' migration .",
    "@xcite presented a preliminary model for the torque due to the asymmetry in the librating region owing to planet migration , based on the behaviour of particle orbits .",
    "these effects have been described as ` type - iii ' migration to differentiate this regime from the previously identified regimes of migration of embedded planets ( type i ) and gap - opening planets ( type ii ) @xcite .",
    "recently the numerical results of @xcite have been challenged by @xcite , who found that the effect is strongly or completely suppressed when the region close to the planet is better resolved .",
    "the reality of runaway migration is therefore in some doubt .    in the case of a planet with an eccentric orbit ,",
    "potential components are present at first order in the eccentricity that have angular pattern speeds different from the mean motion of the planet .",
    "the principal effect of the associated corotation and lindblad torques is to cause the eccentricity to evolve .",
    "provided that a deep gap is cleared around the planet , so that the coorbital eccentric lindblad resonances are ineffective , there is a fine balance between the growth of eccentricity through eccentric lindblad resonances and its decay through eccentric corotation resonances , which are non - coorbital @xcite , if many such resonances are able to compete with each other .",
    "even a partial saturation of the corotation torques therefore promotes the growth of the planet s eccentricity . it should be noted , however , that whether the eccentricity grows or decays depends on a number of additional factors .",
    "@xcite discussed some of the relevant issues but further work is required to treat the development of eccentricity in the disc and the conservative secular exchange of eccentricity between the planet and the disc .",
    "we recently analysed the saturation of the non - coorbital corotation resonance in a gaseous disc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) . unlike the calculations of @xcite and @xcite , which",
    ", owing to the extreme complexity of the coorbital region , necessarily have the nature of a toy model , our calculation is based on an asymptotically exact reduction of the problem making minimal assumptions .",
    "we showed that the steady corotation torque for any non - coorbital resonance is reduced below the value specified by gt79 by a factor @xmath9 depending on a single dimensionless parameter @xmath10 , which measures the strength of the forcing relative to the effects of viscosity in the disc .",
    "we computed the function @xmath9 numerically and derived analytical approximations for small and large @xmath10 .",
    "our result was used by @xcite in their theory of the growth of the eccentricity of a protoplanet through a finite - amplitude instability , and our findings have recently been corroborated by @xcite using localized numerical simulations .",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to extend the analysis of paper  i to include the effect of planetary migration .",
    "we also examine the time - dependent approach to a steady state and emphasize the interpretation of the solutions in real space rather than fourier space .",
    "finally , we attempt to relate our findings in a preliminary way to the coorbital region and the issue of runaway migration .",
    "in paper  i we carried out a systematic asymptotic analysis of the corotation region of a three - dimensional , barotropic , viscous , non - self - gravitating disc subject to a uniformly rotating external potential perturbation . to calculate the steady torque exerted on the disc",
    ", we sought a solution that is steady in the corotating frame of reference .",
    "we made use of the small parameter @xmath11 , which is a characteristic value of the angular semithickness @xmath12 of the disc . in units",
    "such that the corotation radius and the corresponding angular velocity are of order unity , we adopted natural scalings such that the width and height of the corotation region are @xmath13 .",
    "we introduced scaled radial and vertical coordinates , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , to resolve the inner structure of this region .",
    "it is a simple matter to restore time - dependence to the original problem .",
    "the characteristic time - scale for establishing the steady solution is @xmath16 , this being typical of both the libration time - scale and the viscous diffusion time - scale across the corotation region under our scaling assumptions .",
    "we therefore allow the solution to depend on a ` slow ' time variable @xmath17 , and the effect is to replace each instance of the operator @xmath18 as in equation ( 17 ) of paper  i , with @xmath19    a further adaptation allows for a ` very slow ' time - dependence of the external potential .",
    "this is natural if we consider a fourier component of the tidal potential of a planet that migrates through the disc on a time - scale that is long compared to the orbital time - scale and also compared to the characteristic time - scales of libration and viscous diffusion across the corotation region . in this case both the radial structure and the angular pattern speed of the potential evolve very slowly in time .",
    "we allow for this formally by introducing a very slow time variable @xmath20 and writing the potential perturbation in the midplane @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 being the usual azimuthal angle in an inertial frame of reference .",
    "the pattern speed of the potential is then @xmath25 , a very slowly varying angular frequency of order unity , and the corotation radius is @xmath26 , defined by the condition @xmath27 .",
    "we transform from spatial coordinates @xmath28 to @xmath29 , with @xmath30 using the chain rule we find @xmath31    we proceed to solve the fluid dynamical equations as in paper  i by expanding the solution in powers of @xmath11 . whereas previously we looked for a strictly steady solution in the corotating frame , now the solution depends on the slow and very slow time variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the time - derivative associated with the dependence on @xmath33 is small , @xmath34 , and does not affect the equations to the order that we considered . on the other hand , there is a new ` advective ' time - derivative @xmath35 at @xmath13 that does affect the analysis , along with the derivative with respect to @xmath32 .",

    "the time - dependence of the coefficients is neglected , on the basis that the time - scale for establishing the solution is short ( measured by @xmath32 ) compared to that on which the coefficients vary significantly ( measured by @xmath33 ) .    as in paper",
    "i , we consider a single potential component of the form @xmath51 and the solution for @xmath52 may be assumed to have the same periodicity in @xmath50 .",
    "the total tidal torque exerted in the corotation region can be written as @xmath53 the boundary condition as @xmath54 is that @xmath55 .",

    "it should be noted that the quantity @xmath84 does not contain any contribution from the drift ; it is a galilean - invariant quantity and is most easily evaluated in the non - moving frame .",
    "evidently , equation ( [ dq ] ) derives from a version of potential vorticity conservation .",
    "three - dimensional effects are absent for the flows under consideration , which are quasi - two - dimensional because the motion is predominantly horizontal and maintains a quasi - hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction .",
    "only when @xmath76 do the viscous terms have a simple closed form in terms of @xmath74 .",
    "it is of interest to plot the streamlines of the velocity field ( [ u ] ) , which are contour lines of the streamfunction @xmath85 these are not the exact streamlines of the fluid but represent the dominant motion @xmath86 in the comoving frame . in the rescaled variables of section  [ sec : dimensionless ] , the streamfunction is proportional to @xmath87 and the shape of the streamlines depends only on the dimensionless parameter @xmath88 introduced previously , which measures the drift speed relative to the characteristic libration speed .",

    ", the streamlines circulate both interior and exterior to the resonant radius , but form symmetric librating islands centred on the resonance .",
    "the drift breaks the symmetry of the flow with respect to the @xmath47-axis .",
    "if the drift is not too fast ( @xmath97 ) the librating islands remain but they become asymmetrical and are diminished in size ; this opening allows gas to flow through from the outer disc to the inner disc ( if @xmath99 ) .",
    "a fast drift ( @xmath98 ) destroys the librating islands and allows a free streaming across the corotation region . for a given strength of potential",
    "there is therefore a critical migration rate that changes the topology of the flow and inhibits the libration normally associated with the corotation resonance .",
    "now equation ( [ q ] ) can be interpreted as an advection  diffusion equation with a steady source term .",
    "the quantity @xmath83 that is being advected and diffused is ( minus ) the fractional vortensity perturbation , and the source term derives from the velocity perturbation @xmath49 induced by the forcing . in the presence of viscosity a steady solution will be approached in which the advective and diffusive terms balance the source term , i.e. @xmath100 in appendix  [ sec : ade ] we analyse the solution of an equation of this type in the limit of small viscosity .",
    "the conclusion is that the perturbation builds up on the closed streamlines of the librating region to a value , proportional to @xmath101 , at which it is equilibrated by outward diffusion to the region of open streamlines .",
    "we apply equation  ( [ dqpm1 ] ) of appendix  [ sec : ade ] by setting the source term equal to @xmath102 and noting that the first contribution integrates to zero .",
    "also @xmath103 is replaced by the constant value @xmath104 because the radial derivatives are asymptotically dominant .",
    "therefore @xmath105 in the librating region in a steady state , where @xmath106 is the streamfunction of the separatrix . in the region of open streamlines outside ,",
    "@xmath107 where the integral is taken along the streamline from far upstream , and @xmath108 is the travel time along the streamline .      the corotation torque ( [ tc ] ) can also be expressed in terms of @xmath83 , noting that the last term in equation ( [ q ] ) integrates to zero : @xmath109 in the low - viscosity limit , the torque in a steady state is then ( again using the results of appendix  [ sec : ade ] ) @xmath110 ^ 2\\,{\\rm d}\\chi , \\label{tc_est}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first integral is over the librating region and the second is over the region of open streamlines .    the separatrix bounding the librating region is the streamline passing through the saddle point at @xmath94 , @xmath111 .",

    "after some rearrangement , and remembering that there are @xmath0 copies of the librating region , we find the ratio of the torque to the gt79 value in the low - viscosity limit to be @xmath118 ^ 3\\,{\\rm d}\\theta}&\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\quad+\\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\int\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\sin\\theta\\,{\\rm d}\\tilde\\lambda\\right]^2\\,{\\rm d}\\tilde\\chi , \\label{tc_limit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second integral is over a single copy of the streaming region , and the dimensionless streamfunction and travel time are defined by @xmath119      the physical meaning of this analysis is that , if the disc has a large - scale vortensity gradient , fluid that is trapped in the corotation resonance and forced to drift with it attempts to preserve its original vortensity .",
    "a steady state is achieved when the vortensity anomaly is equilibrated by viscous diffusion to the fluid outside the librating region .",
    "if the viscosity is small , the torque comes mainly from the librating region ( the first term in equation  [ tc_est ] or equation  [ tc_limit ] ) but there is a further contribution , differing from the gt79 torque only by a factor of order unity , from the fluid that streams through the resonance ( the second term in the same equations ) .",
    "the first integral in equation  ( [ tc_limit ] ) is a dimensionless quantity of order unity that decreases monotonically from @xmath120 to  @xmath121 as @xmath122 increases from  @xmath121 to  @xmath91 and the librating region shrinks ( cf .",
    "[ f : stream ] ) .",
    "therefore the first contribution to @xmath65 scales as @xmath123 for small @xmath93 . in dimensional terms",
    "this contribution to the torque scales as @xmath124 a simple order - of - magnitude argument for this result can be given as follows . in the absence of turbulent diffusion ,",
    "the vortensity in the librating region remains constant as the planet migrates .",
    "however , diffusion limits the contrast in @xmath74 between the librating region and the background to @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the viscous time - scale across the libration region of radial width @xmath127 for which @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "then the torque in equation  ( [ torque_scaling ] ) can be understood as @xmath129 .",
    "this is only a fraction of order @xmath130 of the rate of change of orbital angular momentum of the trapped region .",
    "the reason that only a fraction is required is that the region occupied by the moving trapped fluid is replenished by fluid of the ambient vortensity .. the torque required to move a small vortex patch of mass @xmath0 and strength @xmath131 and mass @xmath0 radially at speed @xmath132 is @xmath133 .",
    "this is a fraction @xmath134 of the torque required to move radially a particle of mass @xmath0 in a circular keplerian orbit of angular velocity @xmath135 . ]",
    "the angular momentum taken up by the vortensity anomaly is somewhat analogous to the kinetic energy developed by the entropy anomaly in stellar convection .",
    "both situations involve the interchange of perturbed and ambient material .",
    "an equation that is analogous to equation  ( [ torque_scaling ] ) holds in the case of convection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case",
    ", the kinetic energy is proportional to the unperturbed entropy gradient ( analogue of the vortensity gradient ) , gravity ( analogue of the angular momentum gradient ) and the square of the mixing length ( analogue of the drift speed ) .",
    "evidently this analysis may break down if the viscosity is too small , for then the anomaly @xmath136 will not be small and further nonlinearity may intervene .",
    "in addition , if the viscosity if very small , this steady state may take so long to be achieved that the torque needs to be considered in a time - dependent sense .",
    "however , a possible way to rationalize the large value of @xmath65 obtained in the low - viscosity limit is as follows .",
    "suppose that the resonance drifts outwards in a disc in which @xmath45 is a decreasing function of @xmath2 . by the time a steady state",
    "is reached , the ambient surface density , and therefore @xmath137 , may be very small",
    ". however , the torque may be significant because it derives from the trapped fluid . in this case",
    "@xmath65 will be very large , although it will not be described accurately by the approximations we have adopted .",
    "the second torque integral in equation  ( [ tc_limit ] ) , which derives from the open streamlines , is also a dimensionless quantity of order unity . in the limit of fast streaming ( @xmath138 )",
    "the dimensionless streamfunction and travel time may be approximated as @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the second integral in equation  ( [ tc_limit ] ) then reduces to a standard fresnel integral with the result that @xmath141 . the unsaturated gt79 torque is therefore recovered in the limit of fast migration .",

    "this enhanced torque derives from the librating region where a viscously equilibrated vortensity anomaly is established .",

    "good agreement is found between the results obtained with independent numerical methods .",
    "as discussed in paper  i and by @xcite , the modification of the corotation torque has consequences for the eccentricity evolution of young planets orbiting in a protoplanetary disc .",
    "we consider the first - order eccentric corotation resonances associated with a planet of mass ratio @xmath179 executing an orbit of eccentricity @xmath180 and semimajor axis @xmath181 within a keplerian disc .",
    "inner and outer resonances occur at radii @xmath182 and the associated torques lead to eccentricity damping .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless parameters @xmath10 and @xmath93 for a migrating planet are @xmath183 @xmath184 where the notation is as in paper  i ( @xmath185 being a correction factor that tends to unity for large @xmath0 ) . furthermore @xmath186^{1/3}\\left(\\frac{{\\rm d}r_{\\rm c}/{\\rm d}t}{u_\\nu}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath187 is the characteristic magnitude of the radial velocity in a keplerian accretion disc .    in type - ii migration the factor",
    "@xmath188 is close to unity while the factor in square brackets is very small .",
    "either @xmath93 or @xmath10 must be small , so the large enhancement of the torque seen in fig .",
    "[ f : varyv ] does not occur .",
    "it is possible to have @xmath98 if @xmath180 is sufficiently small .",
    "this situation occurs because the librating region is narrow and the libration speed small , so the dimensionless drift speed is large .",
    "but then @xmath150 , since the dimensionless diffusion time - scale is short , and so @xmath189 whether the planet is migrating or not .",
    "therefore planetary migration in the type - ii regime is unimportant for eccentricity evolution , at least as far as the eccentric corotation resonances are concerned .    in type - i migration",
    "the factor @xmath188 can be much larger than unity and @xmath151 need not be small . because of the dependence of @xmath93 on @xmath0 it is likely that the large enhancement of the torque is restricted to a few values of @xmath0 at most .",
    "the issue is less important here because in the type - i regime the eccentricity damping is dominated by coorbital lindblad resonances .",
    "we now consider the possible application of these results to the more difficult problem of the coorbital region for the case of a planet of mass @xmath190 in a circular orbit of radius @xmath191 undergoing radial migration .",
    "the perturbing potential in this case , including the indirect term , is @xmath192 and the corotation radius is @xmath193 , where @xmath179 is the mass ratio . for @xmath194 , and in the coorbital region where @xmath39 satisfies @xmath195 ,",
    "the perturbing potential can be adequately approximated as @xmath196 where @xmath197 .",
    "the @xmath47-dependence in this expression is needed , of course , to localize the singularity of the potential at the location of the planet . in the case of the non - coorbital corotation resonance it was possible to treat the perturbing potential as being independent of @xmath47 .",
    "we construct an approximation to the flow in the coorbital region by taking the leading - order radial and azimuthal velocity perturbations to be @xmath198 these expressions derive from the linearized fluid dynamical equations in the corotation region , when terms proportional to @xmath47 and those associated with pressure and viscosity are neglected . the expression for @xmath49",
    "is identical to equation ( [ up ] ) , but the equivalent for @xmath199 is also needed for consistency near the planet . thus the leading - order velocity field in the comoving frame is @xmath200-\\frac{{\\rm d}r_{\\rm c}}{{\\rm d}t}\\right\\}\\,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$e$}}_r}&\\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\left[\\frac{1}{2}q\\omega x\\left(s^2+\\frac{x^2}{r^2}\\right)^{-3/2}-\\frac{3}{2}\\omega x\\right]\\,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$e$}}_\\varphi , \\label{u_coorb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath135 are evaluated at @xmath48 , and we have specialized to the case of a keplerian disc . fig .",
    "[ f : coorbital3 ] shows some streamlines , based on this velocity field , for an inwardly migrating planet . there is a trapped region on the leading side of the planet , and there are open streamlines that pass the planet on its trailing side",
    "this behaviour is a consequence of the higher ( lower ) magnitude of radial velocity that results on the trailing ( leading ) side of the planet when the inward migration velocity is combined with the velocity @xmath201 .",
    "a similar asymmetric behaviour was found by @xcite .    in the absence of migration ,",
    "the stagnation points can be identified as the standard lagrange points : @xmath202 as the migration rate is increased from zero , a bifurcation occurs at @xmath203 , at which what were l3 and l4 ( or l5 , depending on the sign of @xmath204 ) merge and disappear .",
    "this behaviour can be seen in figs  [ f : coorbital1 ] and  [ f : coorbital2 ] , where the separatrices are plotted",
    ". however , a librating region continues to exist for any migration rate .",
    "this is an important difference with the case of the non - coorbital corotation resonance .",
    "if the coorbital torque depends on the migration rate @xmath205 , then @xmath206 satisfies a nonlinear equation of the form @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the angular momentum of the planet in a circular orbit , and @xmath209 is the ` lindblad ' torque that comes from the non - coorbital region of the disc and does not depend ( or not sensitively , at least ) on @xmath205 .",
    "if the migration is slow enough that the coorbital region is in a quasi - steady state , then @xmath210 can be replaced with its steady value @xmath211 .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that @xmath210 is directly proportional to @xmath206 , but evaluated at a retarded time owing to the effects of libration .",
    "our analysis suggests that the dependence on @xmath206 is nonlinear in general , although in the coorbital case it may not resemble fig .",
    "[ f : varyv ] in detail because of the persistence of the librating region as @xmath206 is increased .",
    "equation ( [ adot ] ) may then have any number of solutions representing quasi - steady migration , and these solutions may be stable or unstable .",
    "suppose that the planet migrates quasi - steadily according to one of the solutions of equation ( [ adot ] ) but is then perturbed slightly , for example by applying and removing an extraneous torque .",
    "the corotation torque will take some time to adjust to the these changes .",
    "if it relaxes monotonically towards the steady value @xmath212 , then it can be shown that the migration is stable if @xmath213 and unstable in the opposite case .",
    "[ formally this can be shown by combining equation ( [ adot ] ) with a relaxation equation such as @xmath214 . ]",
    "if the quasi - steady solutions of equation ( [ adot ] ) are viewed as the points of intersection of the graph @xmath211 with a straight line of gradient @xmath215 , then the solutions alternate in stability as the curve cuts the line alternately from below and from above .",
    "while in the analysis of @xcite there is only one solution and it is either stable or unstable , here the possibility exists , in principle , of the planet finding an alternative migration rate that is stable .",
    "we have investigated the effects of the radial migration of a planet through a disc on the corotation resonance and the associated torque .",
    "our analysis deals mainly with non - coorbital corotation resonances , which are critical to eccentricity evolution @xcite .",
    "it was carried out using semi - analytical methods that account for the effects of gas pressure , turbulent viscosity and nonlinear saturation , as well the migration of the planet .",
    "our approach does not account for the possible effects of shocks that cause changes in vortensity , which can be studied instead through nonlinear simulations .    in the absence of radial motion ,",
    "the corotational flow pattern consists of islands of closed streamlines , surrounded by a modified keplerian flow that circulates around the star .",
    "the radial motion of the planet causes the resonance to drift through the disc and modifies the streamlines in the comoving frame , separating the closed regions and allowing radial flow through the coorbital region ( see fig .",
    "[ f : stream ] ) . at faster migration rates",
    "the closed regions are destroyed .",
    "the characteristic radial velocity for this transition is the radial width of the libration region divided by the libration time - scale .",
    "we find that the ratio of the resonant torque in a steady state to the value given by gt79 depends essentially on two dimensionless parameters .",
    "one of these ( @xmath10 ) is proportional to the ratio of the characteristic time - scale of viscous diffusion across the librating region of the resonance to the characteristic time - scale of libration ( raised to the power @xmath149 ) ; in the absence of migration , this parameter alone determines the degree of saturation of the resonance .",
    "the second parameter ( @xmath93 ) is proportional to the ratio of the drift speed of the resonance to the characteristic radial velocity in the librating region ; this determines the shape of the streamlines .",
    "when the drift speed is comparable to the libration speed and the viscosity is small , the torque achieved in a steady state can be much larger than the unsaturated value in the absence of migration , but is still proportional to the large - scale vortensity gradient in the disc .",
    "the resulting corotation torque is a nonlinear function of drift speed , which peaks at the characteristic velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ f : varyv ] ) .",
    "the radial motion of a planet generally enhances the corotation torque by an amount that varies inversely with the turbulent viscosity , in the limit of small viscosity .",
    "this torque does not change sign under reversal of the direction of radial motion .",
    "the corotation torque is proportional to the vortensity gradient , and the dependence on viscosity can be understood in terms of the vortensity redistribution in the corotation region .",
    "the trapped material attempts to preserve its original vortensity as it migrates radially into locations of different vortensity .",
    "as the contrast in vortensity between the trapped regions and surrounding background increases , the torque increases as well , but is limited by viscous diffusion between the two regions .",
    "if the viscosity is very small this steady state may take so long to be achieved that the torque needs to be considered in a time - dependent sense . a generally smaller contribution to",
    "the torque arises from material that passes across the coorbital region , between the islands of closed streamlines .",
    "we suggest that the physics of the non - coorbital resonance can provide insight into the more complicated situation for the coorbital region .",
    "there are similarities between the flow patterns in the two cases ( figs  [ f : stream ] and  [ f : coorbital3 ] ) . in each case , there are regions of closed streamlines that move with the planet , as well as open streamlines that pass through the corotation region .",
    "we expect that the torque that results from the closed streamlines in the coorbital case also involves the contrast between the background vortensity and the advected vortensity .",
    "the torque from the closed streamlines would then be again inversely proportional to viscosity , in the small viscosity limit , provided that a large vortensity anomaly is able to accumulate .",
    "there are certainly differences between the two cases . in the coorbital region , many different azimuthal components of the potential participate and there is a singularity present due to the presence of the planet .",
    "because of the singularity , there is always a region of trapped streamlines on one side of the planet for any migration rate and this region will contribute to the coorbital torque .",
    "the analogy between the non - coorbital and coorbital cases also suggests that there may be , in some circumstances , several possible migration rates in a given system because the corotation torque is a nonlinear function of the migration rate .",
    "which one is achieved depends on the initial conditions and on considerations of stability , as discussed in section  [ s : stability ] .",
    "it is possible that fast migration does occur under some appropriate conditions .",
    "@xcite emphasized the importance of a mass deficit in a partially cleared gap .",
    "our analysis does not involve a gap , but considers the role of advected vortensity .",
    "the mass deficit would certainly contribute to the advected vortensity contrast with the background , but may not be necessary .",
    "more accurate modelling of the coorbital region is required to determine its contribution to the migration rate .",
