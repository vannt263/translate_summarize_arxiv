    "a system of two coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations represents the basic model of propagation of weakly dispersive waves having vectorial nature , i.e. , characterized by two components , below designated by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this model is relevant for almost all applications of the nonlinear physics .",
    "when the system is supplied by balanced gain and losses , as well as by the linear coupling , characterized respectively by positive coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 , it reads @xmath7 where all the nonlinear coefficients , i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real .",
    "model ( [ manakov ] ) describes wave guiding in structures obeying parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry  @xcite . here",
    "the parity symmetry is defined by the mapping @xmath11 .",
    "time reversal operator @xmath12 is defined by the map @xmath13 this means that if @xmath14 , then the nonlinearity is also @xmath0 symmetric , i.e. , for any solution @xmath15 defined in the symmetric interval @xmath16 $ ] , there also exists another solution @xmath17 hereafter an overbar stands for the complex conjugation . notice that the nonlinear coupling coefficients @xmath10 in ( [ manakov ] ) are considered to be equal in the both equations to ensure that the system is hamiltonian in the absence of gain and loss with @xmath18 .    coupled nls equations ( [ manakov ] ) with @xmath0-symmetric nonlinearity @xmath14 and with @xmath19 , introduced independently in  @xcite for the constant gain - and - loss coefficient and in  @xcite for gain and losses localized along the waveguide , can be viewed as an extension of the nonlinear dimer model  @xcite . in the subsequent works  @xcite more general nonlinearities , including ones with @xmath20 , were thoroughly studied .",
    "it was found that the model supports bright solitons  @xcite , dark solitons  @xcite , peregrin solitons and rogue waves  @xcite , and breathers  @xcite .",
    "for all refereed cases it is important that the nonlinearity obeys @xmath0 symmetry ( for the relevance of @xmath0 symmetry of the nonlinearity , see  @xcite ) .    system ( [ manakov ] ) is integrable if @xmath21 and @xmath22 , representing the well - known manakov model  @xcite ( see also @xcite for review of these integrable systems ) .",
    "it turns out , that this particular type of ( all equal ) nonlinearities is peculiar also for the @xmath0-symmetric model which accounts for gain and losses , as well as for the linear coupling .",
    "more generally , the role of the type of nonlinearity ( i.e. , non @xmath0-symmetric , @xmath0-symmetric , and manakov type ) can be crucial for the long time behavior of the solution . indication on such possibility stems form the recent results on the stability of trajectories of the nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric dimer .",
    "namely , the nonlinear dimer @xmath23 has trajectories escaping to infinity ( as @xmath24 )  @xcite , while the @xmath25-symmetric manakov dimer , i.e. , the system @xmath26 has all trajectories bounded  @xcite , provided that @xmath27 .",
    "note that the later constraint is related to linear stability of the zero equilibrium in systems ( [ manakov ] ) , ( [ dimer ] ) , and ( [ dimerm ] ) .",
    "in the theory of @xmath0-symmetric systems , it is referred to as a condition of unbroken @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we address the existence and boundedness of solutions to the cauchy problem for the generalized manakov system ( [ manakov ] ) with different types of nonlinear coefficients . for the situations where analytical results are not available",
    ", we perform numerical simulations .",
    "we also extend the global existence results to the case of two spatial dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "main results in one dimension are presented in section 2 .",
    "they consist of two theorems , the first one about global well - posedness of the general model ( [ manakov ] ) and the second one is about bounds on the @xmath2-norm of the solution in the @xmath0-symmetric manakov case .",
    "the two theorems are then proved in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "section 5 reports numerical results illustrating that the @xmath1 norm is also bounded in the @xmath0-symmetric manakov case , but it may grow to infinity in the @xmath0-symmetric non - manakov case .",
    "finally , extensions of these results to the @xmath0-symmetric manakov system in two spatial dimensions are considered in the concluding section 6 .",
    "because system ( [ manakov ] ) is semi - linear , it can be rewritten in an integral form by using duhamel s principle . applying the well - known method based on the contraction mapping principle",
    "( see @xcite for details ) , one can immediately establish existence and uniqueness of local solutions of the cauchy problem for system ( [ manakov ] ) in sobolev spaces @xmath28 for any @xmath29 . in what follows ,",
    "we are interested in the behavior of solutions in the energy space @xmath30 , which corresponds to @xmath31 and appears to be most relevant for physical applications .",
    "our first result establishes existence of global solutions in the energy space for arbitrary choice of coefficients in the generalized manakov system ( [ manakov ] ) .    for any @xmath32",
    ", there exists a unique global solution @xmath33 of the generalized manakov system ( [ manakov ] ) such that @xmath34 .",
    "[ theorem-1 ]    we remark , that explicit examples of global solutions , including bright solitons , can be readily obtained in the case @xmath35 and @xmath27 , since the substitution  @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 , reduces system ( [ manakov ] ) to the integrable nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath39    the @xmath1-norm of a global solution to the generalized manakov system ( [ manakov ] ) remains finite but may grow as @xmath24 .",
    "this growth happens typically in the systems with gains and losses , at least for sufficiently large initial data , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is then quite surprising that the manakov system ( [ manakov ] ) with @xmath40 has bounded solutions in the @xmath2-norm if @xmath27 ( i.e. under the condition of the unbroken @xmath0 symmetry ) .",
    "the next theorem formulates the corresponding result .",
    "assume @xmath22 and @xmath27 .",

    "the result of theorem [ theorem-1 ] is novel and the proof is based on deriving an apriori energy estimates for the @xmath1-norm of the local solutions and applying gronwall s inequality .",
    "also note that the results of theorems [ theorem-1 ] and [ theorem-2 ] do not clarify if the @xmath1-norm of the solution is also globally bounded in the case @xmath22 and @xmath46 .",
    "numerical simulations reported below in sec .  [ sec : num ] support the conjecture that the @xmath1-norm does remain bounded in the dynamics of the @xmath0-symmetric manakov system but may grow to infinity in the @xmath0-symmetric non - manakov case .",

    ", we take the limits for the sequences and obtain the following balance equation for the local solutions in @xmath30 : @xmath63 we shall now control the homogeneous @xmath30 norm of the solution by using the integral quantity @xmath64 note that @xmath65 is a part of @xmath61 but it does not satisfy a nice balance equation , for which the nonlinear terms cancel out . in other words , the energy balance equation for @xmath65 can not be estimated in terms of @xmath65 only .",
    "for this purpose , we use @xmath61 and , therefore , we shall first establish a correspondence between @xmath65 and @xmath61 .",
    "let us recall the gagliardo  nirenberg inequality @xcite .",

    ", we conclude the proof of theorem [ theorem-1 ] on the existence of the unique global solution of the generalized manakov system ( [ manakov ] ) in @xmath30 .      for the global solution of theorem [ theorem-1 ] , we can introduce the integral stokes variables @xmath83 let us consider the case @xmath22 .",
    "we compute temporal derivatives of the integral stokes variables and obtain @xmath84 where @xmath85 is defined by ( [ power ] ) and satisfies the balance equation ( [ eq : ds0 ] ) .",
    "note that all nonlinear terms cancel out in the system of evolution equations ( [ stokes - system ] ) for the integral stokes variables .",
