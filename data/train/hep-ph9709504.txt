    "first of all , i would like to apologize for not covering a number of items , often very interesting , which were discussed during this conference .",
    "i certainly do not feel competent to address most of the theoretical issues , so this talk will be entirely devoted to experimental results . furthermore , a number of reviews on specific subjects were presented , which it makes no sense to try to summarize : high energy cosmic neutrinos , rare kaon decays , polarized structure functions .",
    "there will be ample opportunities in forthcoming rencontres de moriond to come back to future projects such as b - factories , lhc , long baseline neutrino experiments , ams , or to ongoing experiments which are a bit too young this year to deliver results , such as ktev , na48 or the neutron electric dipole moment measurement at the ill .",
    "these topics will therefore not be covered either .",
    "even with these restrictions , it will be impossible to do justice to the vast amount of material which has been presented in the past week , and i can only reiterate my apologies to those who may feel that their contribution is not adequately referred to in the following .",
    "this presentation will be divided in three ( unequal ) chapters : tests and measurements within the standard model , searches and hints beyond the standard model , and finally neutrino oscillations .",
    "most of the results presented at this conference were stamped as preliminary ; therefore the original contributions should be checked in addition to this summary before quoting any results . for the written version of this talk , the figures have not been incorporated since they can be found easily in these proceedings , with the exception of those belonging to contributions not available to the author at the time of writing .",

    "@xcite    there are two very different methods to measure the w mass in  collisions at lep  2 .",
    "the one relies on the behaviour of the w pair production cross section near threshold .",
    "the other explicitly reconstructs the mass of the final state w bosons from their decay products .",
    "luminosities of about 10  were collected in 1996 by each of the lep experiments both at 161 and 172  gev .",
    "the measurement at threshold was performed at a centre - of - mass energy of 161.33  gev which maximizes the sensitivity of the cross section to the value of the w mass .",
    "( a single measurement at this optimal energy has been shown to be more efficient than a more detailed scan of the threshold region . ) depending whether both , one or none of the produced ws decay leptonically , the final state arising from w pair production consists in _",
    "i ) _ an acoplanar pair of leptons , _ ii ) _ an isolated lepton , missing energy and two hadronic jets , or _",
    "iii ) _ four jets . the first two topologies , which account for 11% and 44% of the final states , respectively , are rather easy to select since they do not suffer from any significant standard model background . the four - jet topology ,",
    "on the other hand , is more difficult to disentangle from the large qcd background , and multivariate analyses are therefore used to retain sensitivity . from the cross section measurement of @xmath18  pb ,",
    "averaged over the four lep experiments , a w mass value of @xmath19  is inferred .",
    "the cross section measurement was repeated at 172  gev and the result is well compatible with the standard model expectation ( fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "while the sensitivity to the w mass is reduced , the larger statistics allow a direct measurement of the w hadronic branching ratio @xmath20 , obtained from the comparison of the cross sections in the various topologies .",
    "this measurement does not compete yet with the indirect determination performed at the tevatron using the ratio of the production cross sections for @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( @xmath21 , as reported in @xcite , hence @xmath22 ) .",
    "it relies however on fewer theoretical inputs .",
    "the direct reconstruction of the w mass has been performed at 172 gev where the statistics is largest .",
    "typically , in the lepton plus two - jet topology where a neutrino escapes detection , a 2c - fit is performed , imposing equality of the two w masses ; in the four - jet topology , a 5c - fit is performed in a similar fashion , or a 4c - fit supplemented by a rescaling of the two dijet energies to the beam energy .",
    "there are a number of subtleties such as the choice of jet pairing in the four - jet topology , the type of functions fitted to the resulting mass distributions , the bias corrections .",
    "clear mass peaks are observed ( fig .  3 of @xcite ) , and an average w mass of @xmath23  is determined .",
    "this measurement is still limited by statistical errors , but theoretical issues such as the effect of colour reconnection in the four - jet topology and technical challenges such as the precise beam energy calibration will become relevant very soon .",

    "@xcite    the search for an anomalous @xmath27 coupling has been pursued at colliders since many years in final states involving a w boson and a high @xmath28 photon .",

    "recent d0 results are shown in fig .  2 of @xcite .",

    "last year , the measurement of @xmath43 , together with @xmath44 , had been said to exclude the standard model at more than 99% cl .",
    "such a statement simply ignored that systematic errors are often of a highly non - gaussian nature , and indeed a lot of effort went , in the past year , into the understanding and the control of these systematic errors .",
    "the most precise measurements of @xmath43 rely on the technique of hemisphere tagging , in which the lifetime and the mass play the major roles . at sld , the small beam spot characteristic of linear colliders and the availability of a vertex detector located at only 3  cm of the beam axis and with three - dimensional readout allow b purities of 98% to be achieved with an efficiency of 35% , after a simple mass cut as shown in fig",
