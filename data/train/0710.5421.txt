    "the `` second solar spectrum '' is a term adopted by stenflo and keller ( 1997 ) to refer to the remarkable observational discovery that the whole solar spectrum is linearly polarized , when observations are made close to the solar limb using novel spectro - polarimeters that allow the detection of very low amplitude polarization signals ( @xmath1 in the degree of linear polarization ) .",
    "this term is certainly adequate because , as pointed out by these authors , the linearly polarized solar spectrum has a structural richness that often exceeds that of the ordinary intensity spectrum .",
    "it is indeed as if the sun has presented us with an entirely new spectrum to explore .",
    "in fact , the second solar spectrum contains a wealth of `` inexplicable '' spectral features which are the signature of physical processes that are presently challenging physicists working in the field .",
    "this paper deals with the modelling issue of the second solar spectrum .",
    "this modelling requires the solution of a formidable numerical problem that is considered as one of the most challenging tasks of solar and stellar polarimetry .",
    "it consists in calculating , for _ multilevel _ atomic models , the excitation and ionization states of chemical species of given abundance that are _ consistent _ with the polarization properties of the radiation field produced by such species in any medium of given temperature , density , macroscopic velocity and magnetic field vector .",
    "once this self - consistent atomic excitation is known along the line of sight , it is straightforward to solve the transfer equations for the stokes parameters in order to calculate the emergent polarization profiles that are to be compared with spectro - polarimetric observations .",
    "it is indeed a very complex problem because , in the polarization transfer case , one has to take into account that each level of total angular momentum value x has associated with it ( 2x+1 ) sublevels , with @xmath2 if fine structure due to the spin - orbit ls coupling is assumed , or with @xmath3 if hyperfine structure due to the nuclear angular momentum @xmath4 is taken into account .",
    "the populations of these sublevels are sensitive to the polarization and anisotropy state of the radiation field at each point within the medium .",
    "moreover , quantum interferences ( or coherences ) among the sublevels themselves may also appear , coherences that depend on the energy separation between the levels and on their splitting .",
    "these coherences must also be properly quantified to fully specify the excitation state .",
    "an additional complication stems from the fact that , in the polarized case , instead of the standard radiative transfer ( rt ) equation for the specific intensity , one has to solve , in general , a vectorial transfer equation for the four stokes parameters .",
    "obviously , accounting for this complexity requires working within the framework of a robust theory for the generation and transfer of polarized radiation .",
    "i believe that the most rigorous ( and suitable ) theoretical framework to work with is that developed by landi deglinnocenti ( 1983 ) , which is based on the irreducible tensor components ( @xmath5 ) of the atomic density matrix ( see also bommier and sahal - brchot , 1978 ) .",
    "according to this formalism , to each level of angular momentum value x , there correspond @xmath6 density - matrix elements .",
    "these @xmath5-elements contain information about the populations of the atomic sublevels and about the coherences among them .",
    "for instance , for a level with total angular momentum j=1 we have that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( with @xmath11=1 , 0 and -1 ) are the populations of the three magnetic sublevels .",
    "thus , @xmath12 gives the total population of the level , while @xmath13 ( the _ orientation _ coefficient ) and @xmath14 ( the _ alignment _ coefficient ) inform us about the _ population differences _ among the sublevels .",
    "finally , @xmath5-terms with @xmath15 account for the coherences between zeeman sublevels whose magnetic quantum numbers differ by @xmath16 .    one of the reasons that explain why the density matrix formalism is so suitable for dealing with the generation and transfer of polarized radiation is that , through an emission process , polarization in spectral lines can originate locally either by the splitting of the atomic levels ( splitting that can in turn be due either to the zeeman or the stark effect ) or by the presence of _ population differences _ and/or _ coherences _ among the sublevels .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 elements whose self - consistent values are sought at each spatial grid - point , indeed provide the most suitable way of quantifying , at the atomic level , the information that we need to be able to calculate all the `` sources '' and `` sinks '' of polarization within the medium under consideration .",
    "the main criticism of this qed theory is that it is based on the approximation of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) , i.e. on an assumption that is not adequate for modelling the polarization of several diagnostically important spectral lines .",
    "fortunately , some very recent work has successfully started to incorporate the effects of partial redistribution ( prd ) into the framework of the density matrix formalism ( see landi deglinnocenti _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; bommier , 1997 a , b ) .",
    "these recent efforts to generalize the density matrix theory to prd are truly important and should be continued because the crd theory can not be applied when coherences between non - degenerate levels are present unless the spectrum of the radiation is flat across a frequency interval @xmath17 centred on the line frequency and larger than the frequency separation between the two levels connected by the coherence ( see landi deglinnocenti _ et al .",
    ".    the problem of finding the self - consistent values of the irreducible tensor components of the atomic density matrix has been called `` the non - lte problem of the @xmath0 kind '' ( see landi deglinnocenti , 1987 ) .",
    "it requires solving jointly the statistical equilibrium ( se ) equations for the density matrix elements associated with each level of the assumed atomic model and the stokes - vector transfer equations for all the radiative transitions involved .",
    "this terminology also seems appropriate because , as i shall try to argue below , a better understanding of many of the `` inexplicable '' spectral features of the second solar spectrum can only be achieved by carefully formulating and solving _ multilevel _ non - lte problems of the @xmath0 kind , taking fully into account the possibility of _ atomic polarization _ at _ all _ the levels of the chosen multilevel atomic model and including the depolarizing role of elastic collisions and magnetic fields .",
    "the word `` inexplicable '' in the preceding paragraphs refers to the impossibility of explaining some of the spectral features of the second solar spectrum by means of theories based on the approximation of neglecting atomic polarization in the _ lower _ level of the line transition under consideration , i.e. theories based on the assumption that there are no significant differences in the populations of the lower - level sublevels or coherences among them .",
    "one example of a mysterious feature of the second solar spectrum that has triggered some recent theoretical work ( see trujillo bueno and landi deglinnocenti , 1997 ; landi deglinnocenti , 1998 ) is the linear polarization pattern observed around the na i @xmath18 and @xmath19 lines .",
    "in fact , in a recent letter in _ nature _ that demonstrates the robustness of the density matrix polarization transfer theory including partial frequency redistribution effects , landi deglinnocenti ( 1998 ) concluded that the observed na @xmath18 and @xmath19 linear polarization pattern can be explained by assuming the presence of an amount of _",
    "ground_-level atomic polarization as important as ( and indeed slightly larger than ! ) that of the upper level .",
    "however , because very small _ non - vertical _ magnetic fields ( and/or elastic collisions ) destroy the ground - level atomic polarization of na , landi deglinnocenti ( 1998 ) was forced to rule out in the solar chromosphere both elastic collisions and the existence of turbulent magnetic fields and of horizontal , canopy - like fields stronger than @xmath20 gauss .",
    "this has led to an exciting apparent paradox in solar physics because there are observational evidence for both turbulent fields of the order of 10 gauss and canopy - like horizontal fields ( see jones , 1984 ; solanki and steiner , 1990 ; faurobert - scholl , 1992 ; bianda _ et .",
    "al _ , 1998 ; stenflo _ et .",
    "al _ , 1998 ) .",
    "the argument in favour of the simplifying approximation of neglecting lower - level polarization is that the lower level of a line transition is generally long - lived , and that it must thus have plenty of time to be depolarized by elastic collisions and/or weak magnetic fields ( stenflo , 1994 ; 1997 ) .",
    "however , this is expected to be the case concerning only the _ ground _ and _ metastable _ levels of atomic systems .",
    "it is indeed a major simplifying approximation because it implies that the scattered radiation can be expressed linearly in terms of the incident radiation if stimulated emission processes are also neglected ( see landi deglinnocenti , 1984 ) .",
    "in other words , the approximation of neglecting lower - level atomic polarization allows the study of scattering line polarization problems in terms of phase matrices that are decoupled from the se equations .",
    "however , as we shall show below , the consideration of lower - level atomic polarization leads to a coupled system of _ non - linear _ equations , even for the simplest case of a two - level model atom .",
    "my motivation for writing this paper is two - fold .",
    "firstly , i would like to provide more arguments concerning the idea ( already put forward in the paper by trujillo bueno and landi deglinnocenti , 1997 ) that lower - level atomic polarization is an essential physical ingredient for understanding the second solar spectrum .",
    "secondly , i aim to demonstrate that , contrary to some general beliefs , the density - matrix polarization transfer theory does have a suitable form for practical applications .",
    "to these ends , i will consider here three types of line transitions in the solar atmosphere : ( @xmath21 ) lines with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 ) lines with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and ( @xmath27 ) lines with @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "section 2 summarizes the predictions of the standard theory , which neglects lower - level atomic polarization .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to outlining the formulation of the scattering line polarization problem taking into account atomic polarization in both the upper and the lower levels of such line transitions . here",
    "i will show the self - consistent solution for the density matrix elements and the corresponding emergent fractional linear polarization that results from this more correct treatment .",
    "section 4 discusses model calculations including the depolarizing role of elastic collisions .",
    "as we shall see , my two - level atom scattering line polarization calculations suggest that , if we aim at understanding the second solar spectrum , we need to consider scattering processes in _",
    "multilevel _ atomic models , taking fully into account the transfer of atomic polarization among all the atomic levels involved .",
    "section 5 argues that , in principle , the above - mentioned `` na solar paradox '' might admit a _",
    "multilevel _ solution .",
    "however , section 6 shows that the observed fractional linear polarization in the mg @xmath24-lines can only be explained by invoking the presence of atomic polarization in the lower _ metastable _ levels of the mg @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines , thus establishing a new paradox : the `` mg solar paradox '' .",
    "finally , section 7 gives some concluding remarks after pointing out that there is no multilevel solution to this `` mg solar paradox '' .",
    "the appendix is dedicated to a brief description of some iterative methods for the solution of non - lte problems of the @xmath0 kind , which i consider as `` the road to be taken '' for the development of a general multilevel scattering line polarization code .",
    "this and the following section deal with the scattering line polarization problem assuming a one - dimensional ( 1d ) , plane - parallel , non - magnetic , static solar atmospheric model and a two - level model atom neglecting stimulated emission processes .",
    "the only difference is that the results presented in this section are obtained with the standard theory , which neglects _ atomic polarization _ in the lower level , while those shown in the next section are the result of the application of the full theory that takes into account atomic polarization at both levels .",
    "a detailed formulation of the _ standard _ resonance line polarization problem , together with some numerical results obtained applying novel iterative schemes , can be found in the paper by trujillo bueno and manso sainz ( 1999 ) . in that paper",
    "it is clarified that in order to specify the excitation state of two - level atoms without ground - level atomic polarization it is enough to consider two density - matrix elements at each spatial grid - point : @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see also landi deglinnocenti _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1990 ) . the first one , i.e. @xmath32 , measures the overall population of the _ upper _ level , while @xmath31 is the so - called _ alignment _ coefficient , which quantifies the degree of imbalance in the populations of the _ upper_-level sublevels .    in the stellar atmospheric environment",
    "the main physical mechanism that leads to population differences among the sublevels of the atomic levels is the anisotropic illumination of the atoms .",
    "this is easy to understand by considering the academic case of a unidirectional unpolarized light beam that illuminates a gas of two - level atoms with @xmath33 and @xmath23 and that is propagating along the direction chosen as the quantization axis .",
    "since these atoms must absorb @xmath34 units of angular momentum from the light beam , only the transitions corresponding to @xmath35 are effective , so that no transitions occur to the @xmath36 sublevel of the upper level .",
    "thus , in the absence of any relaxation mechanisms , the upper - level sublevels with @xmath37 and @xmath38 would be more populated than the @xmath36 sublevel and the alignment coefficient @xmath39 would have a _ positive _ value . clearly , the amount of this atomic alignment in a stellar atmospheric environment is significantly smaller than in such an academic case due to the relaxation mechanisms present in a stellar atmosphere ( e.g. depolarizing collisions and magnetic fields ) and to the much weaker degree of the radiation field s anisotropy .    as mentioned above , in order to calculate the fractional linear polarization emerging from a given solar atmospheric model we have first to find the _ self - consistent _ values of @xmath32 and @xmath40 by solving the se and the rt equations ( see trujillo bueno and manso sainz , 1999 ) .",
    "figure 1@xmath21 shows the variation with the line integrated optical depth of the self - consistent values of @xmath41 for the three types of line transitions mentioned in the introduction , calculated for the case of _ zero _ depolarizing rate due to elastic collisions .",
    "[ fig1 ]    as seen in fig .",
    "1@xmath21 , the largest values for the upper - level alignment are obtained for line transitions with @xmath33 and @xmath23 , i.e. for triplet lines .",
    "alignment values @xmath42 are found in the surface layers , while @xmath40 becomes negligible for optical depths @xmath43 , because in these high - opacity regions the radiation field approaches isotropy .",
    "the alignment of the upper level is found to be zero for lines with @xmath44 and @xmath26 , as expected from the fact that levels with j=0 have no sublevel structure . for lines with @xmath45 we have @xmath46 , i.e. alignment absolute values that are _ smaller _ than for the case of triplet lines .",
    "figure 1@xmath24 shows the corresponding emergent fractional linear polarization ( q / i ) for simulated observations at @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the stellar surface . in order to understand these results we point out that , for this _ standard _ resonance line polarization case where population differences among the lower - level sublevels are neglected , one has the following rt equations ( see , e.g. , trujillo bueno and manso sainz , 1999 ) :    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the geometrical distance along the ray and where the _ line _ contributions to the i and q components of the emission vector are :    @xmath52,\\ ] ]    @xmath53    with @xmath54 the total number of atoms per unit volume , @xmath55 the line frequency , @xmath56 the einstein spontaneous emission coefficient , @xmath57 the normalized line profile ( where @xmath58 is the frequency measured from the line centre in units of the doppler width ) , and @xmath59 is equal to the @xmath60 coefficient introduced by landi deglinnocenti ( 1984 ) , whose values for transitions @xmath61 are ( see table 1 in landi deglinnocenti , 1984 ) :    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    the above transfer equations show that , for this standard resonance line polarization case , the absorption matrix is _ diagonal _",
    ", i.e. @xmath65 , where the line contribution to the i - component of the absorption matrix is given by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the einstein coefficient for the absorption process and @xmath68 is simply proportional to the total population of the _ lower _ level .    therefore , from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , one sees that the emissivity in q at each point within the atmosphere is directly proportional to the alignment coefficient of the _ upper _ level , weighted by a number ( @xmath59 ) that depends on the total angular momentum of the lower and upper levels .",
    "the conclusion is that the standard theory predicts the largest fractional linear polarization for triplet lines ( @xmath69 at the line centre at @xmath70 ) , _ zero _ linear polarization for lines with @xmath44 and @xmath26 , while for lines with @xmath45 we have q / i@xmath71 at @xmath70 .",
    "consider again the above - mentioned academic case of an unpolarized light beam incident on a gas of two - level atoms , but now with @xmath44 and @xmath26 . in this case",
    "no transitions can occur out of the @xmath36 sublevel of the _ lower _ level , since only transitions corresponding to @xmath72 are effective . on the other hand , the spontaneous de - excitation from the upper level populates with equal probability the three sublevels ( @xmath73 ) of the _ lower _ level . in the absence of any relaxation mechanisms ,",
    "the final result of this optical - pumping cycle is that all atoms will eventually be pumped into the @xmath36 sublevel of the _ lower _ level , and the medium will become transparent .    in the quantum optics literature",
    "this is known as _ depopulation pumping _",
    "( happer , 1972 ; see also landolfi and landi deglinnocenti , 1986 ) .",
    "as we have seen , depopulation pumping occurs when certain lower - level sublevels absorb light more strongly than others . as a result",
    ", an excess population tends to build up in the weakly absorbing sublevels . in the above two - level atom example depopulation",
    "pumping leads to a _ negative _ lower - level alignment coefficient @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the total population of the lower level .",
    "the physical mechanism that is responsible of these population differences between the _",
    "lower_-level subleves is again the _ anisotropic _ illumination of the atoms .",
    "thus , if the anisotropy of the solar radiation field is capable of inducing significant population differences among the upper - level sublevels , why should it not be capable of producing similar _ lower_-level alignment coefficient values ?",
    "in fact , it does , as demonstrated by trujillo bueno and landi deglinnocenti ( 1997 ) , who formulated this scattering line polarization problem and solved the ensuing non - local and non - linear set of equations .",
    "for instance , for a line transition with @xmath44 and @xmath26 in a two - level model atom the rate equation that governs the temporal evolution of @xmath76 is    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the upward inelastic collisional rate and @xmath79 the lower - level depolarizing rate due to elastic collisions . in this equation @xmath80",
    "is given by a frequency and angular average of the stokes - i parameter weighted by the line absorption profile , while @xmath81 is given by a frequency and angular integral of the stokes i and q parameters , additionally weighted by some angle - dependent factors .",
    "these quantities ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) are two of the spherical tensor components of the radiation field ( see landi deglinnocenti , 1983 ) and they quantify , respectively , the average intensity of the radiation field and mainly the degree of its anisotropy .    all the rates in eq . ( 6 ) are _ relaxation _ rates .",
    "we point out that the most important radiative rates here are the first and the third , which are due , respectively , to the _ anisotropic _ ( @xmath82 ) and to the _ isotropic _ ( @xmath83 ) components of the radiation field tensor , acting on the unpolarized and polarized components of the lower - level density matrix , respectively . neglecting in eq .",
    "( 6 ) the collisional rates and taking into account the weakly anisotropic nature of the solar radiation field ( i.e. that @xmath84 ) one finds that @xmath85 .",
    "figure 2@xmath21 shows the self - consistent solution for @xmath86 , for the zero depolarizing rate case , but taking into account inelastic collisions .",
    "the question now is whether the presence of population differences in the lower level can by itself lead to local sources of linear polarization .",
    "the answer is affirmative . to understand this we have to write down the transfer equations for the stokes i and q parameters that result from the application of the density - matrix theory taking into account the possibility of atomic polarization in both levels ( trujillo bueno and landi deglinnocenti , 1997 ) :    @xmath87    @xmath88    where the _ line _ contribution to @xmath89 and the full q - component of the absorption matrix ( which is _ not _ diagonal now ! )",
    "are given by    @xmath90,\\ ] ]    @xmath91    where @xmath92 should not be confused with the @xmath59-symbol of eqs .",

    "thus , for @xmath99 transitions the term @xmath101 in eq .",

    "( 10 ) shows that the existence of differences in the populations of the magnetic sublevels of the _ lower _ level leads to non - zero values of @xmath102 , i.e. it introduces _ dichroism _ in the stellar atmosphere and a coupling of the intensity of the radiation beam with the stokes q - parameter that is due to the absorption process .",
    "note that the larger the absolute value of the alignment coefficient @xmath76 , the larger the expected q / i signal ( trujillo bueno and landi deglinnocenti , 1997 ) .",

    "the prediction of the correct two - level atom theory for line transitions with @xmath44 and @xmath26 is that the emergent fractional linear polarization is _ as important as that corresponding to triplet lines_.    [ fig1 ]    finally , we ask how important can be the fractional linear polarization in lines with @xmath45 when atomic alignment is taken into account in both the upper and the lower levels . for two - level atoms with",
    "these angular momentum values four quantities are needed to fully specify their excitation state : @xmath32 , @xmath40 , @xmath68 and @xmath76 .",
    "these quantities at all the spatial grid - points are the _ unknowns _ whose self - consistent values are sought . to this end",

    "a detailed presentation of these _ non - linear _ equations will be published elsewhere . for our purposes here we simply write down the rate equation that governs the temporal evolution of @xmath40 :    @xmath103    in this equation the first and last terms are _ relaxation _ rates , while the remaining ones are _ transfer _ rates",
    ". we point out that , besides the usual rate @xmath104 , which results from the _ anisotropic _ component ( @xmath82 ) of the radiation field , we now have three _ extra _ rates that are due to _ transfer of atomic polarization from the lower level to the upper level_. the most important of these three rates is the transfer rate due to the _ isotropic _ component ( @xmath105 ) of the radiation field , i.e. @xmath106 . the rate @xmath107 is to be interpreted as transfer of atomic alignment from the lower to the upper level by _ inelastic _ collisions , where @xmath108 is the @xmath109 multipole component of the inelastic collisional rate .",
    "these three _ extra _ rates ( but mainly @xmath110 ! ) produce an additional contribution to the atomic alignment of the upper level which , in turn , implies an _ extra _ contribution to the linear polarization emitted by the atoms at each spatial point .",
    "it is also important to point out that there is a further mechanism that contributes to the emergent linear polarization , and that it also arises from the presence of atomic alignment in the lower level .",

    "theory should show up very different degrees of linear polarization ) turn out to lead to similar amounts of linear polarization when the effect of lower - level atomic alignment is taken into account .",
    "elastic collisions have a depolarizing role , i.e. they reduce the alignment of the atomic levels . the rate of level depolarization is expected to be comparable with the ordinary collisional broadening rate .",
    "figure 4 shows a rough estimate of the variation with height in the val - c solar atmospheric model ( vernazza , avrett and loeser , 1981 ) of the depolarizing rates corresponding to the lower and upper levels of the mg i @xmath29 line , whose einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission is @xmath115 . the approximate formulae for the calculation of depolarizing rates used here are similar to those presented by lamb and ter haar ( 1971 ) , which only take into account elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms and are based on the short range of the van der waals interaction .",
    "for reference purposes the dotted line gives the height variation of the temperature in the val - c solar model atmosphere .",
    "as seen in the figure the rough estimates of the depolarizing rates for the chromospheric mg @xmath29 line vary between @xmath116 in the solar photosphere and @xmath117 in the upper chromosphere , with a value of about @xmath118 at a height of 500 km .",

    "as expected , increasing @xmath123-values produce correspondingly decreasing emergent fractional linear polarization signals .",

    "in other words , for @xmath124 the alignment of the ground level has been already destroyed , while the amount of upper - level alignment is still important and very similar to that predicted by the standard theory .",

    "the explanation of the linear polarization pattern around the na @xmath18 and @xmath19 lines proposed by landi deglinnocenti ( 1998 ) implies the _ absence _ of depolarizing effects due to magnetic fields and/or to elastic collisions . as pointed out by landi deglinnocenti ( 1998 ) this apparently leads to a paradox because , on the one hand , his two - level atom modelling , characterized by an amount of _",

    "in fact , it is known that the two - level atom approximation does not apply to minority species like na i , because the difference in coupling to the continuum reservoir between the two levels affects the populations strongly ( bruls , rutten and shchukina , 1992 ) . the two - level atom rate eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 11 ) can also be invoked to point out that the amount of atomic alignment of the upper level of a line transition in a _ multilevel _ atomic model is expected to be _ different _ from that predicted by a two - level atom approach . on the one hand ,",
    "_ extra _ contributions to @xmath40 ( with @xmath127 the upper level of the line transition being considered ) can come from the transfer of atomic alignment from lower levels `` @xmath11 '' with excitation energy @xmath128 , including also the contribution due to the @xmath109 multipole component of the upward inelastic collisional rate ( @xmath129 ) . on the other hand , @xmath40 can be modified via the radiative rates that are due to _ absorption _ to higher levels `` @xmath130 '' with @xmath131 and also because , in a multilevel model atom , we can have transfer of alignment from higher levels `` @xmath130 '' to the level `` @xmath127 '' , including also contributions that can arise via the @xmath109 multipole component of the downward inelastic collisional rate ( @xmath132 ) .    for the na @xmath18 and @xmath19 lines",
    "their lower level @xmath133 is the ground level and in the multilevel scenario being suggested here there is no atomic polarization in this _ ground _ level because it is completely destroyed by both magnetic fields and elastic collisions .",
    "the extra contributions to the alignment of the hyperfine components of the upper levels @xmath134 and @xmath135 of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 lines , which is needed to explain the observations , can then only come from the transfer of alignment from higher levels and _ from the relaxation rates due to absorption processes from these two upper levels to higher ones_. by having a detailed look at multilevel atomic models for na it is easy to see that there are radiative transitions from the levels @xmath134 and @xmath135 to higher levels in the grotrian diagram that are probably influenced by optical pumping processes . in doing this complicated modelling for the na atom",
    "it will be also of interest to take into account the transfer of atomic alignment , among the hyperfine components of the two levels @xmath134 and @xmath135 , due to the multipole components of inelastic collisional rates .",
    "since the lifetime of non - ground atomic levels is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the ground - level lifetime , one finds that neither low - gauss magnetic fields nor elastic collisions with rates not larger than @xmath122 can destroy the atomic polarization of such excited levels .",
    "note that in this multilevel scenario there is no contribution to the emitted linear polarization due to dichroism ( i.e. to the term @xmath111 of eq .",
    "8) , simply because we are saying that the na _",
    "ground_-level atomic polarization is practically destroyed by depolarizing mechanisms .",
    "speculations apart , what it is really important to emphasize is that a better understanding of the observed linear polarization pattern around the na d lines ( and of the second solar spectrum in general ! ) can only be achieved after carefully formulating and solving _ multilevel _ non - lte problems of the @xmath0 kind , taking fully into account the possibility of _ atomic polarization _ at _ all _ the atomic levels and considering the depolarizing role of elastic collisions and magnetic fields . to this end , it is imperative to develop a general multilevel scattering line polarization code .",
    "for this , we had first to develop some suitable iterative methods for the solution of non - lte problems of the @xmath0 kind that are briefly described in the appendix .",
    "in an observational search for lower - level atomic polarization the first choice of lines to look at are those suggested in the paper of trujillo bueno and landi deglinnocenti ( 1997 ) , i.e. lines with @xmath44 and @xmath26 and ideally corresponding to atoms devoid of hyperfine structure .",
    "these are `` null '' lines because the standard theory predicts zero linear polarization for them and the only mechanism capable of producing non - zero line polarization values is the possible presence of lower - level atomic polarization .",
    "a useful list with this type of line transition can easily be obtained by selecting only the unblended lines from a long list of spectral lines with @xmath44 and @xmath26 that can be automatically found by computer search in the whole spectrum .",
    "jorge snchez almeida and i followed this strategy and , in september 1997 , we made an observing run using semel s technique ( semel , 1994 ; see also bianda _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1998 ) with the gregory - coud telescope operated by gttingen university at the spanish observatorio del teide ( tenerife , spain ) .",
    "unfortunately , we could not reach any definitive conclusion because , due to non - linearities in the ccd camera used , we failed to reach the good polarimetric sensitivity that should be achievable with semel s technique .",
    "a similar observational programe is being pursued independently by other colleagues using the polarimeter zimpol attached to the mcmath solar telescope at kitt peak observatory ( stenflo 1998 ; private communication ) .",
    "this is an instrumental set - up that can reach very high polarimetric sensitivity and it is likely that their search will soon lead to some useful results .",
    "perhaps a good idea for exploring whether lower - level atomic polarization is at work in the solar _ photosphere _ is that of performing spectropolarimetric observations in two lines of the same multiplet , having very similar line formation properties , but one having @xmath44 and @xmath26 ( i.e. a `` null '' line ) and the other being a triplet line ( i.e. with @xmath33 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "an example can be found in the si i 5701.11 and the si i 5665.55 lines , respectively .",
    "it is also of interest to mention that , in our list , there is no `` null '' line whose lower level is the ground level .",
    "the lower level is always an excited level whose lifetime is not much larger than the lifetime of the upper level .",
    "although the observation of linear polarization in such lines would be an irrefutable proof of the existence of lower - level atomic polarization , the detection of hanle depolarization in the same lines would imply the existence of magnetic fields of the order of a few gauss .",
    "the situation is different from the case analyzed by landi deglinnocenti ( 1998 ) because , for the sodium d lines , the lower level is the ground level and a magnetic field of the order of few mgauss is sufficient to destroy its atomic polarization .",
    "one can also try to obtain some observational hints about the importance of lower - level atomic polarization for understanding the second solar spectrum by using different line transitions .",
    "for instance , in this paper we have also paid some attention to lines with @xmath45 .",
    "a very interesting line with these total angular momentum values is the mg i @xmath29 line at 5172.68  , which belongs to the multiplet @xmath136 . in this same multiplet",
    "we find the mg i @xmath28 line at 5183.60 @xmath137 ( which is a @xmath138 transition ) and the mg i @xmath139 line at 5167.32 @xmath137 ( which is a @xmath140 transition ) .",
    "we point out that @xmath141 of mg has zero nuclear spin .",
    "these three lines share the same upper level ( @xmath142 ) that has @xmath23 .",
    "assume that , at each point in the solar atmosphere , we know the exact value of the fractional alignment coefficient ( @xmath143 ) of this upper level .",
    "if one now calculates at the line centre the emergent fractional linear polarization",
    "( q / i ) assuming that there is no atomic polarization in their corresponding lower levels one finds values proportional to @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 for the mg @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath139 lines , respectively , and where the minus sign indicates that the electric vector is parallel to the nearest solar limb , while the plus sign refers to the perpendicular direction .",
    "however , this prediction of the standard polarization transfer theory is not correct because old polarimetric observations ( stenflo _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1983 ) and",
    "recent zimpol observations of the second solar spectrum ( stenflo , 1998 ; private communication ) show that the emergent fractional linear polarization in the mg @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath139 lines are _ similar_. it is informative to mention that all the workshop participants could see the q / i plot of the @xmath140 mg i @xmath139 line stamped on our workshop identification cards .",
    "what emergent q / i signal would we find if in the _ lower _ levels of the mg @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines ( which have @xmath147 and @xmath44 , respectively ) we had an amount of atomic alignment _",
    "larger _ than the one of the upper level ?",
    "as discussed above , the presence of atomic alignment in the lower level of a line transition leads to an extra contribution to the linear polarization originating at each atmospheric point that comes from the term @xmath111 of eq .",
    "( 8) , with @xmath148 ( see eq .",
    "this contribution adds to the usual one ( @xmath149 ) that is proportional to @xmath150 ( see eq .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the following expression holds at @xmath151 for the purpose of estimating the _ emergent _ fractional linear polarization :    @xmath152    where @xmath153 and @xmath143 . using this expression and eqs . ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 10 ) we find that , close to the limb , the _ emergent _ fractional linear polarization at the line centre is approximately given by    @xmath154    where the second contribution is that due to _",
    "dichroism_. taking into account , from table i of landi deglinnocenti ( 1984 ) , that @xmath155 for the @xmath156 @xmath29 line and that @xmath157 and @xmath158 for the @xmath159 @xmath28 line , and assuming that @xmath160 for the mg @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines , one arrives at the conclusion that the presence of a sizable amount of lower - level atomic alignment would imply that the emergent fractional linear polarization in the mg @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath139 lines would be _ similar _ , as the above - mentioned observations show .    finally , it is necessary to note that the lower levels of the mg @xmath24 lines are metastable .",
    "the @xmath161 level is indeed connected to the ground level @xmath162 by a forbidden transition at 4571  , but its lifetime for spontaneous de - excitations is of the order of @xmath163 , whereas the lifetime of the other two levels ( @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) is even larger .",
    "thus , if levels @xmath165 and @xmath161 ( the lower levels of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines , respectively ) turn out to have an amount of atomic polarization that is _ larger _ ( in absolute value ) than that of the upper level , we would end up with a conclusion similar to that found by landi deglinnocenti ( 1998 ) using the na d lines argument ,",
    "i.e. that magnetic fields stronger than about a few mgauss , either in the form of _ volume - filling _ turbulent fields or in the form of canopy - like , horizontal fields , can not exist in the solar chromosphere .",
    "although the line formation regions of the mg @xmath24 lines are much _ higher _ than those of the mg 4571 @xmath137 line , i think that careful spectropolarimetric limb observations in the mg 4571 @xmath140 line should be carried out urgently .",
    "this may tell us whether the _ lower _ level of the mg @xmath29 line is polarized at the atmospheric heights of formation of the mg 4571 @xmath137 line ( @xmath166 km ) .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that this line is formed much closer to lte than other lines of similar strength because it is an optically forbidden intercombination line . in any case",
    ", a new paradox seems to exist : the `` mg solar paradox '' .",
    "there is a crucial difference between the na and mg `` solar paradoxes '' . for na",
    "there was still the chance that the multilevel scenario outlined above might help to solve it . however , there is no similar multilevel solution for the `` mg solar paradox '' , which leads to the conclusion that there must indeed exist _",
    "ground_-level and _ metastable_-level atomic polarization in the solar chromosphere .",
    "the three mg @xmath24 lines share the same upper level and what can not be understood by means of the standard transfer theory ( which neglects lower - level polarization ) is that the observed linear polarization in these three mg @xmath24 lines turns out to be similar .",
    "thus , even if one chooses multilevel atomic models for mg to calculate the self - consistent values of the density - matrix elements , and then solves the stokes transfer equations to get the emergent fractional linear polarization , but neglecting the dichroism contribution that comes from the atomic alignment of the lower _ metastable _ levels , one would find again that the ensuing prediction is wrong .",
    "the only way i see for increasing the emitted polarization in the mg @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines , so as to bring it to the same level of that corresponding to the mg @xmath139 line ( that has @xmath33 ) , is via the _ dichroism _ contribution ( i.e. the term @xmath111 of eq",
    ". 8) . as discussed in section 3",
    ", this _ dichroism _ can only arise if the magnetic sublevels of the @xmath147 and @xmath44 _ metastable _ lower - levels of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines are _ unequally populated_. the same explanation can be given for other groups of lines belonging to other atoms , and arising from a similar multiplet ( @xmath167 ) , with the ensuing appearance of extra `` paradoxes '' for other chemical elements .",
    "as we have seen , the anisotropic illumination of the atoms in a stellar atmosphere can lead to large population imbalances among the lower - level sublevels of many spectral lines .",
    "the modelling of the second solar spectrum requires the reliable calculation of the atomic polarization of the lower and upper levels corresponding to the line transitions of interest . to this end",
    ", it is crucial to be able to consider _ multilevel _ atomic models .",
    "this goal can presently be achieved by formulating the problems of interest within the framework of the density matrix polarization transfer theory ( see landi deglinnocenti , 1983 ) and by numerically solving the ensuing non - linear and non - local equations with the iterative methods presented in the appendix .",
    "only when we know the _ self - consistent _ values of the alignment coefficients of the na and mg atomic levels in several solar atmospheric models shall we be able to figure out a possible solution to such `` solar paradoxes '' .",
    "obviously , we are facing a complex problem here , from the observational , theoretical and modelling viewpoints .",
    "but it is a highly interesting one , not only because of the fascinating physics that it involves , but mainly because in trying to clarify it we may learn something new about the sun .        in general ,",
    "both for two - level and multilevel atomic models , with or without hyperfine structure included , but taking fully into account _",
    "atomic polarization _ in _ all _ the atomic levels , the above - mentioned _ non - linear _ and _ non - local _ system of equations can be symbolically represented as      with @xmath169 a known vector and @xmath170 the _ unknown _ vector formed by the density matrix elements at _ all _ the spatial grid - points , and where @xmath171 is an operator which depends on collisional rates ( both inelastic and elastic ) and on radiation field tensors that are given by weighted frequency and angular averages of the stokes parameters . in these se equations",
    "one finds _",
    "non - linear _ terms of the form @xmath172 ( see eqs . 6 and 11 ) .",
    "they are non - linear because the radiation field tensors @xmath173 depend implicitly on the density matrix elements @xmath174 via the rt equations .",
    "this non - linearity means that the operator @xmath171 depends implicitly on the unknown @xmath170 .",
    "the solution of non - linear problems necessarily requires the application of iterative methods . here",
    ", at each iterative step , one has to manage to set up and solve a suitable linear system of equations whose solution leads to approximate corrections to the unknowns ( see socas navarro and trujillo bueno , 1997 ) . to this end , it is very important that the approximations one introduces for achieving linearity at each iterative step adequately treat the _ coupling _ between transitions and the _ non - locality _ of the problem .",
    "it is also very important to point out that iterative schemes that require the construction and inversion of large matrices are useless .",
    "thus , my first step towards the modelling of the second solar spectrum has been the development of two effective iterative methods that are indeed capable of solving non - linear polarization transfer multilevel problems of the @xmath0 kind without having to build and invert large matrices at each iterative step .",
    "i have called these methods the @xmath175 and @xmath176 iterative schemes .",
    "@xmath175 , besides the name of the famous spanish painter , is an acronym for density - matrix ali method ( which is based on jacobi iteration ) , while @xmath176 , besides the name of the fine french painter , refers here to my density - matrix gauss - seidel iterative scheme .    as pointed out above the non - linear terms appearing in the se equations",
    "are of the form @xmath172 .",
    "a detailed presentation of these iterative methods will be published elsewhere . here",
    "i simply give a `` numerical recipe '' for implementing the dali and degas methods .",
    "it consists in making the following changes for achieving linearity in the se equations at each iterative step :                where @xmath180 ( `` @xmath11 '' being the spatial grid - point under consideration ) is the _ diagonal _ element of a @xmath181 operator that arises in the definition of @xmath182 , and where `` @xmath183 '' is meant to take the value of the previous iterative step , while `` @xmath184 '' simply indicates the density - matrix elements that are to be obtained at the current iterative step by simply solving the resulting linear system of equations . in the dali method",
    "we take @xmath185 , while for degas @xmath186 , with these two quantities ( and also @xmath180 ) calculated , at each iterative step , as explained by trujillo bueno and fabiani bendicho ( 1995 ) ( see also trujillo bueno and manso sainz , 1999 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows an example of the convergence rate of the dali method for a calculation initialized using the lte density - matrix @xmath187-values . with the degas multilevel iterative scheme the number of iterations ( and the computing time ) required to achieve convergence",
    "is substantially smaller .",
    "for the solution of scattering line polarization problems using realistic multilevel atoms it is better to initialize the calculation using the @xmath188 self - consistent values corresponding to the _ unpolarized _ case .",
    "since these @xmath188-values can be directly obtained from the atomic level populations such an initialization can be found easily by using any of the fast rt multilevel codes that are now available ( see , e.g. , socas navarro and trujillo bueno , 1997 ; fabiani bendicho and trujillo bueno , 1999 ) . with this initialization given , it is possible to obtain the self - consistent solution of multilevel scattering line polarization problems formulated with the density matrix theory applying _ one _ of the three following methods : @xmath181iteration , dali iteration or degas iteration , with increasing improvements in the resulting convergence rate .",
