    "the radiative transition @xmath14 is one of the most important processes for the study of flavour physics . as a flavour - changing neutral current interaction",
    "it is a genuine quantum effect within the standard model ( sm ) and has a high sensitivity to new dynamics at short - distance scales . the cleanest way to probe",
    "@xmath14 is the measurement of the inclusive decay @xmath15 , where the impact of strong interactions is well under control ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . for exclusive channels such as @xmath16 , which depend on hadronic quantities describing the hadronization of the final state quarks into a single @xmath17 ,",
    "a theoretical treatment is more difficult . at present , the decay @xmath15 already yields strong tests of the sm and valuable constraints on its possible extensions .",
    "in contrast , not much is currently known experimentally about @xmath18 transitions , the cabibbo - suppressed counterparts of @xmath14 .",
    "they depend on the less well determined weak mixing parameter @xmath19 , rather than @xmath20 , and could be differently affected by new physics . for these reasons",
    "a measurement of @xmath18 will be very important .",
    "however , the inclusive measurement of @xmath21 , theoretically prefered , appears almost impossible because of the dominating background from @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , exclusive channels such as @xmath4 and @xmath2 become the only way to access @xmath18 transitions in the foreseeable future .    the cp - averaged branching ratios of exclusive radiative channels are measured to be @xcite @xmath22 and bounded with 90% confidence level by babar as @xcite @xmath23 the corresponding results from belle read @xcite @xmath24    even though a theoretical treatment of the exclusive decays @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath16 is more challenging than of the inclusive modes , there are circumstances that help us to make this task tractable and that will eventually yield useful phenomenological results .",
    "first , recent studies of exclusive hadronic modes in the heavy - quark limit have led to a better understanding of the strong dynamics of these decays @xcite by establishing factorization formulas in qcd . for the decays",
    "@xmath11 @xcite this approach resulted in particular in a calculation of light - quark loop amplitudes that before constituted an uncontrollable source of uncertainty .",
    "in addition it became possible to extend the computation of @xmath11 amplitudes systematically to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd @xcite , improving on previous analyses @xcite .",
    "second , the impact of hadronic form factors , which dominates theoretical uncertainties , can be reduced by taking the ratio @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio of the corresponding form factors is equal to unity in the limit of @xmath26-flavour symmetry and the hadronic uncertainty is reduced to the effect of @xmath26 breaking , which still needs to be estimated .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the @xmath4 and @xmath0 branching fractions is , at leading order in @xmath27 , directly proportional to the side @xmath5 in the standard unitarity triangle ( ut ) , where @xmath28 here @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are wolfenstein parameters . having the complete nlo result for the decay",
    "amplitudes in @xmath11 at hand , we can calculate @xmath27 corrections to their relation with @xmath32 and evaluate the implications in the ( @xmath33 plane @xcite .    another possibility to reduce hadronic uncertainties",
    "consists in taking the ratio of @xmath3 and @xmath4 branching fractions . using relations between the @xmath34 form factors in the large energy linit",
    ", it can be shown that this ratio is free of long - distance qcd effects in a certain region of @xmath3 phase space .",
    "the form factors cancel in this situation , up to calculable @xmath35 corrections , which leads to a model - independent relationship of @xmath3 and @xmath4 observables to the ckm quantity @xmath36    it is the purpose of this paper to investigate how @xmath11 decays can be used to constrain the parameters of the unitarity triangle .",
    "such constraints simultaneously provide a test for new physics .",
    "the various sources of uncertainty will be discussed in detail in order to quantify the potential of these important decays . in section 2",
    "we recall the analysis of @xmath11 decays at next - to - leading order within the framework of factorization in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "the extraction of ckm parameters based on the ratios @xmath25 is the subject of section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss how theoretically clean information on ckm quantities can be obtained from combining a measurement of @xmath37 with a dalitz - plot analysis of @xmath3 decays .",
    "section 5 contains an update on observables of isospin breaking in @xmath11 and section 6 is devoted to a discussion of the decay mode @xmath2 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "let us briefly summarize the basic formulas relevant for the analysis of @xmath11 at next - to - leading order in qcd .",
    "for more details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the effective weak hamiltonian for @xmath14 transitions is @xmath38 where @xmath39 the relevant operators are the current - current operators @xmath40 , the qcd - penguin operators @xmath41 , and the electro- and chromomagnetic penguin operators @xmath42 .",
    "the most important contributions come from @xmath40 and @xmath42 , which read @xmath43 @xmath44 the impact of penguin operators @xmath45 is very small for most applications , but will be included in the numerical results presented below .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath18 is obtained from ( [ heff])([q7def ] ) by the replacement @xmath46 .    to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements of these operators we employ the heavy - quark limit @xmath47 to get the factorization formula @xcite @xmath48 \\!\\cdot\\epsilon\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the photon polarization 4-vector .",
    "here @xmath50 is a @xmath51 transition form factor , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are leading - twist light - cone distribution amplitudes of the @xmath54 meson and the vector meson @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "these quantities are universal , nonperturbative objects .",
    "they describe the long - distance dynamics of the matrix elements , which is factorized from the perturbative , short - distance interactions expressed in the hard - scattering kernels @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the qcd factorization formula ( [ fform ] ) holds up to corrections of relative order @xmath58 .    to leading order in qcd and leading power in the heavy - quark limit",
    ", @xmath59 gives the only contribution to the @xmath11 amplitude .",
    "its matrix element is simply expressed in terms of the standard form factor , @xmath60 is a purely kinematical function , and the spectator term @xmath61 is absent . at @xmath35 the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 start contributing and the factorization formula becomes nontrivial .    the relevant diagrams for the nlo hard - vertex corrections @xmath64 have been computed in @xcite to get the virtual corrections to the matrix elements for the inclusive @xmath14 mode at next - to - leading order .",
    "for the exclusive modes the same corrections enter the perturbative type i hard - scattering kernels .",
    "the non - vanishing contributions to @xmath57 , where the spectator participates in the hard scattering , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qit2 ] .",
    "we can express both the type i and type ii contributions to the matrix elements @xmath65 in terms of the matrix element @xmath66 , an explicit factor of @xmath67 , and hard - scattering functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are given in @xcite .",
    "weak annihilation contributions are suppressed by one power of @xmath70 but nevertheless calculable in qcd factorization , because in the heavy - quark limit the colour - transparency argument applies to the emitted , highly energetic vector meson . despite their suppression in @xmath70 , they can be enhanced by large wilson coefficients @xmath71 and thus still give important corrections .",
    "this situation is relevant for @xmath4 .",
    "weak annihilation is sensitive to the charge of the decaying @xmath54 meson and thus leads to isospin - breaking differences between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding mechanism is ckm suppressed in the case of @xmath16 , where penguin operators give the dominant effect for isospin breaking .",
    "the total @xmath74 amplitude then can be written as @xmath75\\langle v\\gamma|q_7|\\bar b\\rangle\\ ] ] where the factorization coefficients @xmath76 consist of the wilson coefficient @xmath77 , the contributions from the type - i and type - ii hard - scattering , and annihilation corrections .",
    "one finds a sizeable enhancement of the leading order value , dominated by the @xmath78-type correction .",
    "the net enhancement of @xmath79 at nlo leads to a corresponding enhancement of the branching ratios , for fixed value of the form factor .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkrhomu ] ,    where we show the residual scale dependence for @xmath80 and @xmath81 at leading and next - to - leading order .",
    "as shown already in @xcite , our central values for the @xmath0 branching ratios are higher than the experimental measurements ( [ b0 kg ] ) , ( [ bpkg ] ) .",
    "the dominant theoretical uncertainty comes from the @xmath11 form factors .",
    "we used the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) results @xmath82 and @xmath83 from @xcite .",
    "a recent preliminary lattice qcd determination , @xmath84 @xcite , would give a better agreement with the experimental central values .",
    "further studies of heavy - to - light form factors will also benefit from developments based on factorization and soft - collinear effective theory ( for recent discussions see @xcite ) .",
    "using the experimental results for the exclusive @xmath85 and inclusive @xmath86 branching ratios together with their theory predictions , we could extract a value of the @xmath87 form factor that is essentially independent of ckm factors and potential new physics effects .",
