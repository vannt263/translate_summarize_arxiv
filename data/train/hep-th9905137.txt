    "d - branes @xcite are likely to play an important role in describing nature . in particular , the standard model gauge and matter fields may live inside of @xmath2 spatial dimensional @xmath3-branes , while gravity lives in a larger ( 10 or 11 ) dimensional bulk of the space - time .",
    "this `` brane world '' picture _ a priori _ appears to be a viable scenario , and , based on considerations of gauge and gravitational coupling unification , dilaton stabilization and weakness of the standard model gauge couplings , in @xcite it was actually argued to be a likely description of nature . in particular , these phenomenological constraints seem to be embeddable in the brane world scenario ( with the standard model fields living on branes with @xmath4 ) , which therefore might provide a coherent picture for describing our universe @xcite .",
    "this is largely due to a much higher degree of flexibility of the brane world scenario compared with , say , the old perturbative heterotic framework .    as an example consider the gauge and gravitational couplings which in string theory are expected to unify ( up to an order one factor due to various thresholds @xcite ) at the string scale @xmath5 . in the brane world scenario",
    "_ a priori _ the string scale can be anywhere between the electroweak scale @xmath6 and the planck scale @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the newton s constant ) . if we assume that the bulk is ten dimensional , then the four dimensional gauge and gravitational couplings scale as ) theory . ]",
    "@xmath9 respectively @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the string coupling , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the compactification volumes inside and transverse to the @xmath3-branes , respectively . for @xmath4",
    "there are two _ a priori _ independent volume factors , and , for the fixed gauge coupling @xmath14 ( at the unification , that is , string scale ) and four dimensional planck scale @xmath15 , the string scale is not determined .",
    "this observation was used in @xcite to argue that the gauge and gravitational coupling unification problem can be ameliorated in this context by lowering the string scale @xmath16 down to the gut scale @xmath17 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was noticed that @xmath16 can be further lowered all the way down to tev .",
    "in fact , in the brane world picture _ a priori _ the string scale can be as low as desired as long as it does not directly contradict current experimental data .",
    "in @xcite it was proposed that @xmath16 as well as can not be too much lower than the fundamental planck scale or else the string coupling @xmath11 as well as all the gauge couplings would come out too small contradicting the experimental data . ]",
    "the fundamental ( 10 or 11 dimensional ) planck scale can be around tev .",
    "the observed weakness of the four dimensional gravitational coupling then requires the presence of at least two large ( @xmath18 ) compact directions ( which are transverse to the branes on which the standard model fields are localized ) .",
    "a general discussion of possible brane world embeddings of such a scenario was given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite various non - trivial phenomenological issues were discussed in the context of the tev - scale brane world scenario , and it was argued that this possibility does not appear to be automatically ruled out .    however , in such a scenario , as well as in any scenario where @xmath19 , the gauge coupling unification at @xmath16 would have to arise in a way drastically different from the usual mssm unification which occurs with a remarkable precision @xcite .",
    "it is then desirable to have a mechanism in the tev - scale brane world scenario for lowering the unification scale .",
    "moreover , it would also be necessary to find a concrete extension of the mssm ( where this new mechanism is realized ) such that the unification prediction is just as precise as in the mssm ( at least at one loop ) .",
    "in fact , one could also require that such an extension _ explain _ why couplings unify in the mssm at all , that is , why the unification in the mssm is _ not _ just an `` accident '' assuming that the tev - scale brane world scenario has the pretense of replacing the old framework .    in the brane world picture",
    "there appears to exist a mechanism @xcite for lowering the unification scale .",
    "thus , let the `` size '' @xmath20 of the compact dimensions inside of the @xmath3-brane ( where @xmath21 ) be somewhat large compared with @xmath22 .",
    "then the evolution of the gauge couplings above the kaluza - klein ( kk ) threshold @xmath23 is no longer logarithmic but power - like @xcite .",
    "this observation was used in @xcite to argue that the gauge coupling unification might occur at a scale ( which in the brane world context would be identified with the string scale ) much lower than @xmath24 .    in @xcite a tev - scale supersymmetric standard model ( tssm )",
    "was proposed .",
    "the gauge coupling unification in the tssm indeed occurs via such a higher dimensional mechanism .",
    "moreover , the unification in the tssm is as precise ( at one loop ) as in the mssm , and occurs in the tev range .",
    "in fact , as was argued in @xcite , the gauge coupling unification constraints seem to imply that @xmath16 can not really be lower than @xmath25 . ] .",
    "the tssm also explains why the unification in the mssm is not an accident - if the tssm is indeed ( a part of ) the correct description of nature above the electroweak scale , then the gauge coupling unification in the mssm is explained by the current lack of data which leads to the standard `` desert '' assumption . moreover , as was pointed out in @xcite , after a rather systematic search the tssm is the only ( simple ) solution for the constraints guaranteeing that the gauge couplings unify as precisely ( at one loop ) as in the mssm .    an important question that arises in the context of unification via kk thresholds as well as its concrete realization via",
    "the tssm is the issue of higher loop corrections .",
    "the point here is that even though the unified gauge coupling typically is small , the loop expansion parameter is still of order 1 for it is amplified by a large number of heavy kk modes running in the loops @xcite . in the most general case it is therefore far from being obvious that the higher loop corrections are subleading .",
    "in fact , if one considers a generic kk compactification of a higher dimensional theory _ without _ supersymmetry , the higher loop corrections are as large as the one - loop threshold contribution , and therefore the very idea of gauge coupling unification via kaluza - klein thresholds in this context has no predictive power",
    ".    however , as was pointed out in @xcite , in the context of @xmath0 supersymmetric kk compactifications the situation is drastically different . in this paper",
    "we elaborate the discussions in @xcite as well as @xcite on the issue of higher loop corrections .",
    "in particular , we show that the higher loop corrections are subleading compared with the leading one - loop threshold contribution . here",
    "we give two different ways of arriving at this result .",
    "the first argument is purely field theoretic and is along the lines of that given in @xcite , albeit the argument we give in this paper is somewhat simpler .",
    "the key observation underlying this argument is that the heavy kk modes ( in certain orbifold compactifications we consider in this paper ) have extended , namely , @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "this statement does not only concern the heavy kk spectrum , but also the _ interactions _ involving only heavy kk modes - the three- and four - point couplings of heavy kk states are @xmath1 supersymmetric .",
    "this then implies that the leading ( in powers of the relevant number of the kk modes ) contribution at a given higher loop order vanishes due to certain @xmath1 supersymmetric cancellations ( recall that the gauge coupling is not renormalized beyond two loops in @xmath1 supersymmetric theories ) .",
    "the second argument we give in this paper is string theoretic and utilizes the power of string perturbation techniques .",
    "in fact , the string theoretic discussion we give in this paper allows one to arrive at a clear geometric interpretation of the above mentioned cancellations at higher loops via the d - brane picture as well as string world - sheet expansion in terms of riemann surfaces of various topologies . in this sense , this argument is very much in the spirit of ( but not exactly the same as ) that employed in @xcite to prove finiteness of certain large @xmath26 gauge theories .    to illustrate the formal arguments mentioned above , we explicitly compute various two - loop corrections to the gauge couplings within the above framework .",
    "in fact , the cancellations of heavy kk contributions can be seen explicitly in these two - loop computations .",
    "we also discuss the general setup for performing higher loop computations in the kk theories of this type .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the setup for discussing higher loop corrections to the gauge coupling unification via kaluza - klein thresholds .",
    "in particular , we discuss certain orbifold compactifications of higher dimensional theories in this context . in section",
    "iii we discuss one - loop unification via kaluza - klein thresholds .",
    "in particular , we give the general expression for the one - loop kk thresholds in the context of the orbifold theories discussed in section ii . in section",
    "iv we give the field and string theoretic arguments which show that the underlying @xmath1 supersymmetry ( at the heavy kk levels ) indeed implies cancellation of the leading higher loop contributions .",
    "we also discuss the general setup for computing the subleading higher loop corrections . in section",
    "v we give explicit two loop computations in the above context . in section",
    "vi we remark on various important issues in the context of unification via kaluza - klein thresholds .",
    "in this section we describe the setup for discussing higher loop corrections to the gauge coupling unification via kaluza - klein thresholds .",
    "in particular , we will discuss certain orbifold compactifications of higher dimensional theories in this context .",
    "for definiteness , we will focus on compactifications of six dimensional gauge theories .",
    "generalization to other cases is completely straightforward .",
    "thus , consider a six dimensional gauge theory living in the world - volume of some set of coincident d5-branes .",
    "let the space transverse to the d5-branes be a k3 surface .",
    "then we have @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory living in the world volume of the d5-branes . in the following discussion , for the most part , the directions transverse to the branes are not important",
    ". however , we will still keep track of them to have a clear geometric interpretation of the four dimensional gauge theory .",
    "next , compactify two of the directions inside of the d5-branes on a two - torus @xmath27 .",
    "the low energy effective field theory is then given by the corresponding four dimensional @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theory . here by low energies we mean energies below the compactification scale .",
    "thus , let @xmath28 , where both circles have the same radius @xmath20 . then the compactification scale is given by the mass scale of the first kaluza - klein threshold @xmath23 .",
    "below this scale we have an effective four dimensional gauge theory .",
    "we would now like to obtain an @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory from this setup . to do this , we will mod out the above theory by a discrete orbifold group @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath29 must act on both @xmath27 and k3 such that @xmath30 is a calabi - yau three - fold with @xmath31 holonomy .",
    "note that the action of @xmath29 on @xmath27 must be crystallographic ( or else it is not a symmetry of the theory ) .",
    "this restricts the allowed choices of @xmath29 to abelian cyclic groups @xmath32 . in the following",
    "we will generally refer to @xmath29 as @xmath33 with the understanding that @xmath34 is restricted to the above values .    to discuss the spectrum of the above orbifold model ,",
    "let us introduce some notations .",
    "first , let @xmath35 be the gauge group of the original six dimensional gauge theory .",
    "note that @xmath35 can be a product group .",
    "let the matter content of the six dimensional theory be given by hypermultiplets in various representations of @xmath35 .",
    "we will collectively denote these matter hypermultiplets by @xmath36 .",
    "each hypermultiplet can be written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes a chiral multiplet ( in the four dimensional sense ) with left chirality , whereas @xmath39 denotes the corresponding anti - chiral multiplet with right chirality .",
    "similarly , let @xmath40 be the gauge vector supermultiplet ( of the four dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory ) transforming in the adjoint of @xmath35 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the corresponding @xmath0 gauge vector supermultiplet ( which contains a weyl fermion with left chirality ) , whereas @xmath43 denotes the complement of @xmath42 in @xmath40 , that is , the @xmath0 anti - chiral supermultiplet ( which contains a weyl fermion with right chirality ) transforming in the adjoint of @xmath35 .    next ,",
    "let us discuss the action of the orbifold group @xmath44 on various degrees of freedom .",
    "first , we will assume that the action of @xmath29 on the gauge quantum numbers is trivial ( that is we choose the corresponding gauge bundle to be trivial ) .",
    "thus , orbifolding does _ not _ break the original gauge group @xmath35 .",
    "now , let us discuss the breaking of the @xmath1 supersymmetry to @xmath0 by the orbifold group @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the generator of @xmath29 .",
    "then the action of @xmath45 on the r - parity quantum numbers of states in @xmath40 and @xmath46 is the following : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "geometrically this can be understood from the fact that ( up to an obvious choice of convention ) @xmath45 acts on the complex coordinate @xmath52 on @xmath27 as @xmath53 , while its action on the holomorphic two - form @xmath54 on k3 is given by @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 are the complex coordinates on k3 .",
    "note that the holomorphic three - form @xmath57 is invariant under the action of @xmath29 , which is nothing but the condition that the quotient @xmath30 is a calabi - yau three - fold .    finally , we turn to the action of @xmath29 on the kaluza - klein modes corresponding to the compactification on @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath58 , @xmath59 , be the inverse metric the inverse metric reads : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the radii of the two circles . ] on @xmath27 .",
    "then the masses of the kk modes are given by : @xmath65 here @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are the integer kk momenta corresponding to the @xmath68-cycle respectively @xmath69-cycle on @xmath27 .",
    "the action of the generator @xmath45 of @xmath29 on the kk momenta is given by the corresponding @xmath70 rotation : @xmath71 .",
    "here @xmath72 is the corresponding rotation matrix : @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath74 is an identity matrix .",
    "the zero kk modes with @xmath75 are invariant under the action of @xmath45 . at heavy kk levels with @xmath76",
    "we can form linear combinations such that the action of @xmath45 is diagonal .",
    "these are given by ( @xmath77 ) : @xmath78 note that @xmath79 .",
    "now we are ready to determine the spectrum of the orbifold theory .",
    "we must project onto the states invariant under the action of @xmath29 , that is , onto the @xmath45-invariant states .",
    "these are given by ( @xmath76 ) @xmath80 here , to avoid overcounting , independent choices of @xmath81 are restricted to the appropriate conjugacy classes each containing @xmath34 elements such that they are all related by the corresponding @xmath72 rotations .",
    "note that the massless modes are @xmath0 supersymmetric .",
    "however , the massive kk modes form @xmath1 supermultiplets . thus , for each choice of @xmath81 ( in the corresponding conjugacy class ) , @xmath82 forms a ( short ) massive @xmath1 supersymmetric vector multiplet .",
    "similarly , @xmath83 forms a massive @xmath84 hypermultiplet .",
    "in fact , this statement is not just about the massive kk spectrum , but also holds for massive kk _",
    "interactions _ as well .",
    "more concretely , it is not difficult to see that in the orbifold theory the three- and four - point couplings involving only heavy kk modes are @xmath1 supersymmetric with strengths rescaled by @xmath85 respectively @xmath86 compared with the corresponding couplings in the parent @xmath1 theory . as we will see in the next section",
    ", this fact has important implications for higher loop corrections to the gauge coupling renormalization .",
    "in particular , it implies that the higher loop diagrams with only heavy kk modes running in the loops vanish due to @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "thus , for a higher loop correction to be non - vanishing , it is required that it involves at least one massless line inside of the loops .",
    "as we have already mentioned , massless states do _ not _ have @xmath1 supersymmetry but are only @xmath0 supersymmetric so that the corresponding higher loop contributions are ( generically ) non - vanishing .",
    "nonetheless , as we point out in the next section , such higher loop diagrams are subleading compared with the one - loop gauge coupling renormalization due to the kk thresholds .",
    "this is the key reason why the gauge coupling unification via kk thresholds is meaningful in the present setup .",
    "before we end this section , we would like to point out that we can introduce additional massless matter fields in the above picture such that they do not have heavy kk counterparts .",
    "we will collectively denote these fields by @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the @xmath87 fields can be localized at the fixed points of the orbifold .",
    "that is , they are truly @xmath88 dimensional in contrast , say , to the fields @xmath40 and @xmath36 which can be viewed as propagating in @xmath89 dimensions ( two of which are compact ) .",
    "the fields @xmath87 then only have @xmath0 supersymmetry , and their couplings to other fields including heavy kk modes are also @xmath0 supersymmetric .",
    "one of the reasons for introducing such localized matter fields is that their presence is typically desirable in concrete phenomenological model building .",
    "in this section we discuss one - loop threshold corrections to gauge coupling renormalization due to the heavy kk modes .",
    "in particular , we give the general expression for the kk thresholds in the context of the orbifold theories discussed in the previous section .",
    "we then apply these results to one - loop gauge coupling unification via kaluza - klein thresholds .    to begin with , let us clarify what we mean by gauge coupling unification .",
    "suppose @xmath35 is a product gauge group : @xmath90 , where @xmath91 are simple subgroups ( which can be abelian or non - abelian ) .",
    "at the tree level the gauge couplings @xmath92 for all subgroups are assumed to be the same : @xmath93 . in string theory this is the case if the entire gauge group comes from the same set of coincident branes .",
    "in fact , the tree - level `` unified '' gauge coupling @xmath14 is given by ( here we are using the conventions of @xcite ) : @xmath94 here @xmath11 is the ( ten dimensional ) string coupling , and @xmath95 measures the size of the @xmath96 compact spatial directions inside of the d@xmath3-branes : @xmath97 where @xmath12 is the actual volume of these @xmath96 compact directions , and @xmath5 is the string scale .",
    "note that here @xmath20 is understood only as an `` effective size '' of compactification , and in general it need not coincide with the actual linear dimension(s ) of the compactification space .",
    "the above tree - level relations are subject to radiative corrections . here",
    "we focus on one - loop corrections to the gauge couplings @xmath92 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in gauge couplings at low energies @xmath98 .",
    "these gauge couplings @xmath99 depend upon the energy scale @xmath100 . more concretely , the energy scale dependent",
    "one - loop corrections to the gauge couplings come from the corresponding infra - red ( ir ) divergences due to the massless modes propagating in the loop",
    ". then @xmath100 plays the role of the ir cut - off .",
    "this gives precisely the familiar field theoretic logarithmic evolution of gauge couplings .",
    "there are also energy scale _ independent _ corrections due to various",
    "_ thresholds _ corresponding to massive modes ( with masses @xmath101 ) propagating in the loop .",
    "these thresholds come from the heavy kk modes as well as string states such as string oscillator modes . at one loop",
    "we have : @xmath102 where the one - loop @xmath103-function coefficients @xmath104 correspond to the massless @xmath0 supersymmetric modes : @xmath105 ( see section ii for notations ) . here",
    "we have chosen the ultra - violet ( uv ) cut - off to be the string scale @xmath16 .",
    "this is equivalent to identifying the gauge coupling unification scale with the string scale .",
    "in particular , if we start from the low energy gauge couplings , we can run them up to the string scale by `` integrating in '' the heavy kk modes as we go to higher and higher energies .",
    "then , with the above convention , the gauge couplings unify at the string scale @xmath16 subject to the appropriate choice of the subtraction scheme . in the above approach ,",
    "as we will see in a moment , the choice of the subtraction scheme affects the threshold corrections @xmath106 .    in the following we are interested in the regime where @xmath107 . in this case the threshold corrections due to the kk modes are large and dominate the string thresholds which generically are of order 1 ( or smaller ) @xcite .",
    "we will therefore focus on the kk thresholds .    as we will see in a moment",
    ", the kk threshold computation in the @xmath0 supersymmetric orbifold theory reduces to that in the parent @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "let us therefore first consider the @xmath1 gauge theory with the superfields @xmath40 and @xmath36 which arises upon compactifying the corresponding six dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory ( living in the world - volume of d5-branes ) on @xmath27 . in the following , for the sake of notational convenience , we will be a bit more general and treat it as a compactification of a @xmath108 dimensional theory ( living in the world - volume of d@xmath3-branes ) on a @xmath109-torus @xmath110 .",
    "note that @xmath3 here can take values @xmath111 , and in the former case we have a compactification of a five dimensional gauge theory on a circle ( here the corresponding orbifold group can only be @xmath112 ) . in these notations",
    "the kk spectrum of the @xmath1 theory consists of states with masses @xmath113 ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) with quantum numbers @xmath40 and @xmath36 .",
    "all of the states including the massless ones are @xmath1 supersymmetric , and only contribute to the renormalization of the low energy gauge couplings at one loop - perturbatively there are no corrections to the gauge couplings beyond one loop , which is due to @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "moreover , in the d - brane context _ no other _ states contribute to the gauge coupling renormalization .",
    "this follows from the fact that in perturbative open string theory only bps states can renormalize gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "in six dimensional @xmath0 open string theories the only bps states are the massless modes , while all the other states are non - bps as they come in six dimensional @xmath1 ( that is , four dimensional @xmath116 ) supermultiplets .",
    "the latter , however , do not renormalize gauge couplings ( in the four dimensional gauge theory arising upon compactification on @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore , we are left only with the kk threshold contributions , which we are going to discuss next .",
    "the computation of the gauge coupling renormalization in this @xmath1 gauge theory can be performed entirely within the field theory approach . in particular",
    ", we will treat this theory as a gauge theory with a uv cut - off @xmath117 containing massless modes plus massive kk states .",
    "the role of the cut - off @xmath117 is to restrict the heavy kk modes to a finite subset which essentially amounts to discarding those with masses larger than @xmath117 .",
    "more precisely , one can employ the standard coleman - weinberg prescription which gives the following simple result @xcite : @xmath118 here @xmath100 and @xmath117 are the ir respectively uv cut - offs , and we have parametrized the subtraction scheme dependence by @xmath119 . the one - loop @xmath103-function coefficients @xmath120 are those of the @xmath1 theory : @xmath121 ( see section ii for notations ) .",
    "next , we will identify @xmath117 with the string scale @xmath16 , and the gauge couplings @xmath122 with the `` unified '' gauge coupling @xmath14 .",
    "note that this is the only place where string theory becomes relevant - as we will discuss in the next section , for the above prescription to be meaningful , we must assume that above the cut - off the theory is finite , which is precisely what we expect above the string scale where string theory description takes over . with these identifications ,",
    "we will obtain the expected logarithmic evolution of the low energy ( @xmath98 ) gauge couplings @xmath99 .",
    "this logarithmic contribution comes from the massless modes with @xmath123 : @xmath124 the ir _ finite _ threshold corrections @xmath125 are due to the massive kk modes with @xmath126 .",
    "the leading contribution ( in the regime @xmath107 ) to @xmath125 can be readily evaluated using the poisson resummation , and the result is given by @xcite : @xmath127 here for the sake of simplicity in the case of @xmath27 we assume that the metric @xmath128 on @xmath27 satisfies @xmath129 ( that is , the complex structure on @xmath27 is `` of order 1 '' ) .",
    "note that the subtraction scheme dependent parameter @xmath119 can not be determined within these considerations alone . ] .",
    "however , in a given theory @xmath119 affects the unification scale @xmath16 ( for given values of the low energy gauge couplings ) , and it could , therefore , be determined by fixing @xmath16 via some other low energy quantity ( such as the newton s constant @xmath8 ) .",
    "now we are ready to determine the threshold corrections @xmath106 in the @xmath0 orbifold theory .",
    "in fact , we simply have @xmath130 this follows from the fact that the number of the massive kk modes in the @xmath0 theory is @xmath34 times smaller than in the parent @xmath1 theory , which is due to the @xmath33 orbifold projection .",
    "note that , as we have already mentioned , in ( [ thres ] ) we are ignoring other @xmath131 threshold corrections , namely , those due to heavy string modes .",
    "in the previous section we discussed one - loop renormalization of gauge couplings due to kk thresholds . in this section",
    "we address the issue of higher loop corrections .",
    "in particular , _ a priori _ it might seem that higher loops would destroy the one - loop prediction for the low energy gauge couplings obtained from the assumption that they unify at the string scale , or , equivalently , one - loop unification of gauge couplings via kaluza - klein thresholds .",
    "if so , then the entire framework would have no predictive power .",
    "there are various ways of thinking about higher loop effects , some of them being more precise than others .",
    "thus , one might naively argue that the theories discussed in section ii are higher dimensional and therefore non - renormalizable .",
    "this would imply that one has no control over higher loop corrections .",
    "fortunately , however , this naive argument is too naive .",
    "the key observation here is that the regimes we are dealing with are such that the theories under consideration never become higher dimensional . to make this statement more precise ,",
    "let us recall the tree - level relation between the four dimensional gauge coupling @xmath14 , the string coupling @xmath11 , the string scale @xmath16 ( which is nothing but the uv cut - off in this context ) , and the compactification `` size '' @xmath20 : @xmath132 note that we are working in the regime where the lowest kk threshold is below the string scale .",
    "in fact , it is much below the string scale : @xmath133 .",
    "if we take @xmath20 to be smaller than @xmath22 , then the description in terms of d@xmath3-branes becomes inadequate - we have to `` t - dualize '' into a more adequate description in terms of lower dimensional branes .",
    "thus , if all @xmath96 extra spatial dimensions become smaller than @xmath22 , the adequate description is in terms of d3-branes . now",
    ", if we take @xmath20 to be large compared with @xmath22 , naively this might seem to be sufficient to go into the decompactification regime where the theory essentially becomes @xmath108 dimensional .",
    "however , we wish to keep the four dimensional gauge coupling @xmath14 fixed , so for fixed @xmath11 we would have to decrease @xmath16 while increasing @xmath20 such that @xmath134 is fixed .",
    "this implies that in the decompactification limit @xmath135 the uv cut - off @xmath136 of the theory goes to zero .",
    "that is , the theory never becomes a higher dimensional theory ( which would be non - renormalizable ) with a finite cut - off .",
    "another way of phrasing this statement is that we are dealing with four dimensional gauge theories with a large but _ finite _ number @xmath26 of heavy kk modes .",
    "this number @xmath26 is determined by the cut - off _ vs. _ the first kk threshold ratio .",
    "that is , we can define @xmath26 to be given by @xmath137 . note that here we are implicitly making the assumption that above the uv cut - off scale @xmath16 the theory is actually finite or else truncation of the kk modes to a finite subset could not be justified .",
    "this assumption , however , holds in the string theory context , so as long as we bear in mind that these theories are meaningful only if we embed them in a larger theory such as string theory , the above naive arguments about these theories being higher dimensional and non - renormalizable do not hold .",
    "_ a priori _ there is , however , a more serious worry which can be made precise .",
    "thus , consider a generic kk compactification ( which , in particular , need not be supersymmetric ) .",
    "naively it might seem that as long as the `` unified '' gauge coupling @xmath14 is small the higher loop corrections are negligible .",
    "this is , however , not the case - the true loop expansion parameter is _ not",
    "_ @xmath138 ( which would be the case if the effective field theory description in terms of just the light modes were adequate all the way up to the string scale ) .",
    "rather , the correct expansion parameter is related to the string coupling @xmath11 .",
    "this is due to the fact that although each kk mode ( including the light modes ) couples with the strength of order @xmath14 , there are many , namely , @xmath26 kk modes propagating inside of the loops .",
    "the true loop expansion parameter is therefore , while in the open string sector it is @xmath139 . here",
    "@xmath140 is the number of d@xmath3-branes . in the gauge theory discussion",
    "it arises through the corresponding @xmath103-function coefficients .",
    "in fact , the statement that @xmath141 is the loop expansion parameter in the open string sector is essentially precise .",
    "a more precise statement is that the @xmath142-th loop is weighted by @xmath143 just as is the case in the gauge theory language . ]",
    "@xmath144 this is analogous to considering the effective t hooft s coupling in large @xmath26 gauge theories @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , in concrete phenomenological applications the effective coupling @xmath145 can be of order 1 .",
    "if so , then generically one would expect that higher loop threshold corrections are just as large as one - loop thresholds , that is , that this framework lacks any predictive power .",
    "however , in @xcite it was pointed out that supersymmetry saves the day .",
    "that is , in the case of non - supersymmetric theories the above argument indeed shows that one has no control over higher loop effects . in the supersymmetric case , however , there are subtle cancellations at higher loops such that one loop thresholds are always dominant . here",
    "we would like to reiterate the field theoretic argument of @xcite , and give another way of arriving at the same result using the power of string perturbation techniques . in the next section",
    "we will give explicit two - loop computations which illustrate the general arguments presented in the remainder of this section .",
    "in this subsection we first review ( a simplified version of ) the argument of @xcite which shows that higher loop corrections to the gauge coupling unification via kk thresholds are indeed subleading compared with the leading one - loop contribution . in the following for the sake of simplicity we will omit the subscript @xmath68 labelling the corresponding gauge subgroups @xmath91 . on general grounds we expect that the renormalized gauge coupling at scales @xmath146 is given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the ( @xmath100-independent )",
    "contribution due to heavy kk thresholds , whereas @xmath149 corresponds to the gauge coupling running .",
    "here we are interested in estimating the sizes of both @xmath149 and @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath142-loop order contribution @xmath150 to @xmath151 can be schematically written as @xmath152 where @xmath153 counts the number of the loop propagators corresponding to heavy kk modes with _ independent _ kk momentum summations .",
    "( note that the kk momentum must be conserved inside of the loop diagram as the two external gauge boson lines carry zero kk momentum . )",
    "the enhancement factor @xmath154 arises due to @xmath26 heavy kk states propagating in each of the @xmath153 internal lines .",
    "the coefficients @xmath155 generically depend on the energy scale @xmath100 via the appropriate ir cut - off .",
    "note that for @xmath156 the coefficients @xmath157 ( or smaller ) for energy scales not too much smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "( thus , here and in the following we will treat logarithms of the type @xmath158 as being of order 1 . )    for @xmath159 , naively one might expect a large ( that is , of order @xmath160 ) contribution to @xmath151 coming from the term @xmath161 in ( [ l - loop ] ) .",
    "( note that this term is @xmath100-independent .",
    "more precisely , it is finite in the limit @xmath162 .",
    "this is because all of the internal propagators in this case correspond to heavy kk states . )",
    "however , for @xmath163 this contribution actually vanishes due to @xmath1 supersymmetry of heavy kk modes .",
    "indeed , as we have already pointed out in section ii , the spectrum of heavy kk modes is @xmath1 supersymmetric .",
    "moreover , their interactions ( that is , those involving only heavy kk modes but no massless states ) are also @xmath1 supersymmetric .",
    "this then implies that all diagrams with two external gauge bosons involving only heavy kk modes inside of the loops vanish for gauge couplings are not renormalized beyond one loop in @xmath1 theories .",
    "thus , non - vanishing contributions can only come from diagrams involving at least one massless internal propagator ( with massless modes corresponding to @xmath164 ) .",
    "these diagrams , however , are suppressed by additional powers of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath165 where the estimates here should be understood symbolically ( that is , we are suppressing the @xmath100 dependence in the corresponding contributions ) .",
    "this implies that higher loop contributions to the gauge coupling renormalization are subleading compared with the one - loop contribution , although they are of order 1 so we have to worry about the perturbative `` convergence '' issues .",
    "however , as was argued in @xcite using properties of the holomorphic gauge coupling in @xmath0 supersymmetric theories , we expect the perturbation series to converge for @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is a model dependent convergence radius ( which , in particular , depends on the superpotential ) .",
    "the resummed higher loop corrections are then still expected to be of order 1 and therefore subleading compared with the one - loop contribution @xcite .    in the cases where @xmath145 is somewhat smaller than 1 the perturbation theory can be trusted . in particular , in various phenomenologically applications one might wish to compute higher loop corrections to the gauge coupling unification . in section v we will setup the general framework for computing two - loop corrections and present various explicit calculations at the two - loop order . here",
    ", however , we would like to point out a set of simple rules which seem to be useful in computing higher loop corrections in @xmath0 orbifold theories using the corresponding computations in the parent @xmath1 theories .",
    "it is convenient to normalize gauge couplings so that they are the same in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 theories . at the same time",
    "we will take the @xmath110 in the case of the @xmath1 theory to be the same as that appearing in the orbifold @xmath168 in the @xmath0 theory .",
    "then we have @xmath169 , where @xmath12 is the volume of @xmath110 . to have the low energy gauge couplings the same in the two theories , we then must take @xmath170 , where @xmath171 and @xmath11 are the string couplings in the @xmath1 respectively @xmath0 theories .",
    "having fixed the relative normalization for the gauge couplings in the two theories , let us now discuss three- and four - point couplings involving various states . as we have already pointed out in section ii , the three - point couplings involving only heavy kk states are @xmath172 times weaker in the @xmath0 theory compared with those in the parent @xmath1 theory .",
    "( it then follows that the corresponding factor for the four - point couplings involving only heavy kk states is @xmath86 . ) as to the three - point couplings involving some massless states with @xmath173 quantum numbers , they are not affected by the orbifold projection . that is , if there is at least one massless state in a three - point coupling , then this coupling is the same as in the parent @xmath1 theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the four - point couplings involving one massless state are reduced by @xmath85 , while the four - point couplings involving two massless states are unaffected . using these rules",
    "we can obtain some useful information about the relation between various diagrams in the two theories .",
    "thus , consider an @xmath142-loop diagram with @xmath174 internal propagators corresponding to heavy kk modes with independent kk momentum summations .",
    "for definiteness let us focus on diagrams involving only three - point functions .",
    "( the discussion straightforwardly generalizes to diagrams involving four - point functions as well . )",
    "it is not difficult to see that the value of this diagram in the orbifold theory is reduced by the factor @xmath175 compared with the same diagram in the parent @xmath1 theory .",
    "this suppression factor arises as follows .",
    "note that the heavy kk propagators contribute the suppression factor @xmath176 compared with the corresponding diagram in the parent @xmath1 theory for the number of the heavy kk modes in the orbifold theory is @xmath34 times smaller than in the @xmath1 theory . on the other hand , there are @xmath177 three - point functions involving only heavy kk modes , and each of these three - point functions contributes the suppression factor of @xmath85 .",
    "putting all of this together , we obtain the above total suppression factor of @xmath175 .",
    "note that internal lines corresponding to massless states are not modified compared with the parent @xmath1 theory except for the fact that some of the original @xmath1 massless states are absent in the @xmath0 theory due to the orbifold projection .",
    "this implies that to compute a given diagram with , say , @xmath174 , we can take the corresponding diagram in the @xmath1 theory , discard the terms involving massless states projected out by the orbifold action , and divide the resulting expression by @xmath178 .",
    "this will give us the answer for the corresponding @xmath0 computation .",
    "in the case of diagrams involving only massless internal propagators ( that is , for @xmath179 ) , there is no suppression factor ( unlike in the @xmath174 case ) , and to obtain the answer starting from the corresponding @xmath1 computation , we only need to discard terms involving states projected out by the orbifold action .",
    "the above observations are very useful for simplifying higher loop computations in the orbifold theory once the corresponding computations have been done in the parent @xmath1 theory .",
    "this will become clear in the next section where we present some explicit two - loop computations .",
    "we will see that these simplifications are quite substantial since certain diagrams ( or , more precisely , combinations thereof ) vanish _ even _ if they contain massless internal propagators . on the other hand ,",
    "the diagrams involving `` twisted '' states can not be obtained by a simple orbifold reduction of the @xmath1 theory , therefore they must be computed on a model - to - model basis .      in this subsection",
    "we give a simple string theory argument which allows one to arrive at the above result by utilizing the power of string perturbation techniques .",
    "let us start from the parent @xmath1 supersymmetric theory . in string theory language",
    "the perturbative expansion is in terms of riemann surfaces with various topologies . for the sake of simplicity",
    "let us focus on oriented riemann surfaces with @xmath69 boundaries and @xmath45 handles .",
    "in particular , for the sake of simplicity we will ignore diagrams with cross - caps which are straightforward to incorporate in the following discussion ( see the next subsection for some relevant comments ) .",
    "each boundary corresponds to d - branes , whereas handles correspond to closed string loops . note that each diagram is weighted by @xmath180 , where @xmath11 is the string coupling .",
    "let us first consider the one - loop open string diagram with two boundaries and no handles .",
    "this is the annulus amplitude . in the open string loop channel it is weighted by @xmath181 .",
    "the enhancement by a factor of @xmath26 is due to heavy kk modes propagating in the loop .",
    "alternatively , we can view this diagram in the closed string tree channel where a closed string is exchanged between two d - branes whose boundary states we will denote by @xmath182 . note that in the closed string tree channel there is no enhancement due to exchange of some large number of states - all such states are at least as heavy as @xmath183 ( the winding modes are even heavier with masses @xmath184 ) .",
    "this implies that the enhancement of the annulus amplitude by a factor of @xmath26 in the closed string tree channel is due to the normalization of d - brane boundary states : @xmath185 here the boundary state @xmath186 is normalized so that @xmath187 .",
    "note that this normalization factor can be derived directly by computing the annulus amplitude in the open string loop channel , and then performing the open - closed duality transformation ( that is , the transformation @xmath188 , with @xmath189 the proper time on the annulus ) . indeed ,",
    "in the open string loop channel we have the kk momentum sum which in the closed string tree channel produces the volume factor @xmath12 upon the appropriate poisson resummation ( recall that @xmath190 ) .",
    "let us now consider a diagram with @xmath69 boundaries and no handles .",
    "note that this diagram corresponds to @xmath191 loops in the open string channel . in the closed string tree channel",
    "it can be viewed as @xmath69 d - branes connected by a closed string tree with @xmath192 three - point vertices corresponding to closed string interactions .",
    "each of these vertices is weighted by the factor @xmath193 , where @xmath12 is the volume of the @xmath96 compact directions inside of d@xmath3-branes .",
    "here we are ignoring the volume of transverse directions ( that is , of k3 , or , more precisely , of k3@xmath194 , which we assume to be of order 1 in the string units ) .",
    "thus , such a diagram is weighted by @xmath195 here on the l.h.s .",
    "the first factor @xmath196 corresponds to @xmath69 d - branes ( or , more precisely , their boundary states @xmath182 scaling as @xmath197 ) , whereas the second factor @xmath198 comes from the closed string interaction vertices . on the r.h.s .",
    "we have taken into account that @xmath199 , and @xmath191 .",
    "thus , this contribution corresponds to the term @xmath161 in the expression ( [ l - loop ] ) applied to the @xmath1 theory",
    ".    diagrams with handles correspond to subleading terms with @xmath200 in the language of ( [ l - loop ] ) .",
    "indeed , each handle is accompanied by two three - point interaction vertices leading to the suppression by @xmath201 .",
    "that is , diagrams with @xmath69 boundaries and @xmath45 handles are weighted by @xmath202 where we have taken into account that @xmath203 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath204 in the language of ( [ l - loop ] ) .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath155 in the @xmath1 gauge theory vanish for @xmath205 .",
    "that is , the only non - vanishing diagram in this case is that with @xmath206 .",
    "next , let us consider the orbifold theory with @xmath0 supersymmetry . here",
    "we have @xmath34 different types of d - branes whose corresponding boundary states we will denote by @xmath207 , @xmath208 . the _ untwisted _ boundary states @xmath209 are coherent states made of ( left - right symmetric ) untwisted sector closed string states .",
    "they are related to the boundary states in the parent @xmath1 theory via @xmath210 this can be , for instance , seen by noting that the annulus amplitude in the orbifold theory is obtained from that in the parent theory by inserting the projection operator ( here @xmath45 is the generator of @xmath33 ) @xmath211 into the trace over the hilbert space of open string states ( in the loop channel ) .",
    "the contribution with @xmath212 then corresponds to the closed string exchange between the untwisted boundary states in the closed string tree channel .",
    "this is , however , the same as in the parent theory up to the overall factor of @xmath86 .",
    "as to the contributions corresponding to @xmath213 , these in the closed string tree channel map to closed string exchanges between the corresponding _ twisted _ boundary states @xmath207 , @xmath213 .",
    "the latter are coherent states made of twisted sector closed string states localized at the _ fixed points _ of the orbifold .",
    "note that unlike the untwisted boundary states , the twisted boundary states are normalized so that there is no @xmath214 enhancement factor .",
    "that is , @xmath215 while for the twisted boundary states ( @xmath213 ) we have @xmath216 this can be seen as follows .",
    "first , since the closed string states making up the twisted boundary states are localized at fixed points , these boundary states can not possibly know about the volume of the compact space - they are fixed by the local properties of the orbifold in the vicinity of the fixed points . in particular ,",
    "even if we take the volume of the orbifold to infinity ( that is , if we take @xmath217 ) , the twisted boundary states remain the same .",
    "equivalently , we can arrive at the same conclusion by noticing that in the open string loop channel a non - trivial twist @xmath218 leaves only the origin of the kk momentum lattice invariant .",
    "this implies that the corresponding character does _ not _ contain a sum over the kk momentum states",
    ". in particular , the open - closed duality transformation ( which amounts to taking @xmath219 , where @xmath189 is the proper time on the annulus ) does _ not _ produce any volume factors ( upon the corresponding poisson resummation ) .",
    "note that the untwisted characters do contain the kk momentum sum in the open string loop channel , so in the closed string tree channel we get the volume factor @xmath12 ( which eventually gives rise to the @xmath214 normalization of the untwisted boundary states ) .",
    "to summarize , we have untwisted boundary states with the enhanced normalization factor , and also the twisted boundary states without such an enhancement factor .",
    "the former are the same as in the @xmath1 theory ( up to the overall factor of @xmath85 ) .",
    "the latter are those that carry the information about supersymmetry breaking .",
    "now we are ready to discuss higher loop corrections in the @xmath0 theory .",
    "let us start with diagrams without handles .",
    "out of @xmath69 boundaries we can have @xmath220 untwisted boundaries plus @xmath221 twisted boundaries .",
    "note that if @xmath222 , then for @xmath223 ( that is , at two or higher loops ) the corresponding contribution to the gauge coupling renormalization vanishes .",
    "indeed , the corresponding diagram is the same as in the parent @xmath1 supersymmetric theory up to an overall factor given by the appropriate power of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , non - vanishing diagrams for @xmath223 are those with at least one twisted boundary state .",
    "note that the closed string states propagating along the @xmath221 closed string tubes connecting these boundary states to the interior of the closed string tree are the corresponding twisted closed string states .",
    "three - point couplings between twisted closed string states are weighted by @xmath11 with no additional volume suppression factors .",
    "three - point couplings of two ( @xmath218 and @xmath224 ) twisted sector states with untwisted sector states are weighted by @xmath225 ( just as in the case of three untwisted sector states ) .",
    "it is then not difficult to see that the diagrams involving twisted boundary states can at most be weighted by @xmath226 .",
    "for instance , a diagram with @xmath227 with _ all _ ( including those in the interior of the diagram ) closed string tubes corresponding to twisted sector states would have such a weight .",
    "other diagrams either have the same weight or are more suppressed ( by additional factors of @xmath228 ) . here",
    "one must take into account that the `` total twist '' associated with a given diagram must be trivial , that is , if @xmath229 , @xmath230 , label twists corresponding to the boundary states , we must have @xmath231 thus , the diagrams that `` know '' about reduction of supersymmetry from @xmath1 to @xmath0 are all subleading ( as they are weighted by @xmath232 ) compared with the leading one - loop diagram ( with @xmath233 ) weighted by @xmath156 .",
    "the reader can easily verify that adding handles does not change this conclusion .",
    "thus , we have arrived at the result that the one - loop gauge coupling renormalization is dominant ( @xmath234 ) compared with the higher loop corrections ( which are at best of order 1 ) .    here",
    "we would like to point out that the above argument is very much in the spirit of ( but not exactly the same as ) that employed in @xcite to prove finiteness of certain large @xmath26 gauge theories .",
    "before we end this section , we would like to make a few clarifying remarks .",
    "first , the string theory argument we gave in the previous subsection makes use of the by now well appreciated fact that string perturbation theory is a very efficient way of organizing various gauge theory diagrams .",
    "so string theory in this argument is only a tool - at the end of the day we must take a limit @xmath235 ( more precisely , @xmath236 ) , and the heavy string modes do not play any role except for providing a proper uv cut - off for the resulting gauge theory computation .",
    "next , in the argument of the previous subsection we only considered riemann surfaces with boundaries and handles but no cross - caps .",
    "cross - caps are boundary states corresponding to the orientifold planes . in the context of _",
    "perturbative _ compactifications of open plus closed string theories the latter are required to cancel various tadpoles .",
    "tadpole cancellation implies uv finiteness of the theory which , in the field theory language , would result in cancellation of all power - like threshold corrections to the gauge couplings .",
    "this is due to a cancellation between the annulus ( a cylinder with two boundaries ) and the mbius strip ( a cylinder with one boundary and one cross - cap ) amplitudes @xcite . in the closed string tree - channel",
    "this corresponds to cancellation of the tadpoles due to massless states corresponding to the zero winding modes that couple to d - branes wrapped on a torus .",
    "thus , as was already pointed out in @xcite , unification via kaluza - klein thresholds should be considered in the context of _ non - perturbative _ orientifolds where perturbative tadpoles do _ not _ cancel .",
    "the finiteness of the theory is then due additional _ non - perturbative _ states ( which can arise at both massless as well as massive levels ) which provide an effective cut - off in the theory just as in perturbative heterotic compactifications where the modular integration is restricted to the fundamental domain which excludes extreme uv momenta ( that is , those above a certain energy scale @xmath183 ) . in fact , ( some ) non - perturbative orientifolds , examples of which have been recently discussed in @xcite , can be viewed as hybrid compactifications sharing the features of both perturbative heterotic and orientifold compactifications albeit such compactifications are non - perturbative from both heterotic and orientifold viewpoints . as to the gauge theory computation , in this context",
    "it must be regularized by introducing a uv cut - off which we identify with the string scale . such regulator ( which does not arise in perturbative orientifolds @xcite )",
    "is expected to arise in _ non - perturbative _ orientifolds once we take into account non - perturbative ( from the orientifold viewpoint ) string states which do not have a perturbative description in terms of , say , open strings ending on d - branes .",
    "these states are expected from type i - heterotic duality - thus , already in ten dimensions there are infinitely many bps states ( charged under @xmath237 ) on the heterotic side which can not be seen perturbatively on the type i side .",
    "thus , in the above setup , that is , in the context of non - perturbative orientifolds , gauge coupling renormalization can be computed in the gauge theory context assuming the appropriate cut - off at the string scale @xmath16 ( more precisely , at some scale of order @xmath16 - we have to deal with the subtraction scheme ambiguities ) .",
    "the reason why this uv cut - off scale should be around @xmath16 is clear - quantum gravity becomes important at energies of order of the ( fundamental ) planck scale @xmath238 , which is of order of the string scale for @xmath239 .",
    "in this section we present a computation of two - loop corrections to @xmath240 gauge couplings , for the d5-brane orbifold models described in section ii .",
    "this abelian two - loop case is completely sufficient to illustrate some general features of higher loop corrections .    we will use the standard background field method and evaluate the corresponding photon vacuum polarization diagrams . our starting point",
    "are the diagrams of @xmath0 supersymmetric qed in @xmath241 dimensions .",
    "the diagrams describing the compactified @xmath1 parent theory contain internal propagators with momenta of the form @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the kk component , a two - dimensional lattice vector .",
    "the @xmath244 momentum loop integrals are uv divergent and require a cut - off",
    ". we will apply dimensional regularization and continue the divergent integrals to @xmath245 dimensions .",
    "the uv divergences appear then as @xmath246 poles ; these are subtracted in the renormalization procedure , leaving a finite result which depends on the dimensional regularization scale @xmath117 .",
    "the scale @xmath117 is a uv cut - off which ( in an appropriate subtraction scheme ) can be identified with the string scale @xcite .",
    "however , we are not interested here in the details of uv pole subtractions , therefore we consider `` bare '' diagrams without the uv counterterms .    the @xmath1 supersymmetric two - loop vacuum polarization diagrams ( note that here @xmath247 ) @xmath248 fall into 3 classes , @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 , involving respectively : + @xmath252 hypermultiplet fermion loops ; + @xmath252 hypermultiplet scalar loops ; + @xmath252 susy yukawa couplings of gauginos to hypermultiplets .",
    "+ these diagrams are depicted in fig.1 .",
    "note that all traces of gamma matrices and contractions of lorentz indices are performed in @xmath241 dimensions , ensuring the right counting of fermionic degrees of freedom as well as incorporating the yukawa couplings of four - dimensional scalar photons to hypermultiplet fermions on the same footing as other gauge couplings . as a result of a straightforward computation",
    "we obtain the corresponding contributions to @xmath253 as the integrals over 3 feynman parameters , @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 : @xmath257^{-\\varepsilon/2}\\over [ { ( { \\bf m}+{\\bf n}x)^2\\over x(1-x)}(1-z)+{\\bf n}^2+q^2r^2zy(1-zy)]^{\\varepsilon}}~,\\label{scalar}\\\\ y_2 & = & -s_2~,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath258 .",

    "furthermore the electron mass is not renormalized at one loop .",
    "the sum of all three contributions , @xmath260 in this way , we find a complete cancellation of two - loop corrections to the gauge coupling .",
    "of course , the cancellation of @xmath246 poles is a consequence of the known result , @xmath261 in @xmath1 susy gauge theories .",
    "our two - loop computation provides further evidence for the _ complete _ cancellation of higher loop corrections to gauge couplings .",

    "the subleading contribution , @xmath263 , arises from the diagrams involving one massless propagator while the @xmath179 contribution is due to purely massless diagrams .",

    "we therefore conclude that after orbifolding the diagram @xmath264 reduces to @xmath274 here the factor of @xmath86 arises due to the fact that in the @xmath0 theory we must restrict the summation over the kk modes with kk momenta in the corresponding conjugacy classes ( see section ii ) .",
    "discussed in the previous section , specified to the case of @xmath263 . ] on the other hand , the @xmath0 diagram @xmath275 still vanishes due to ( [ vanish ] ) .",
    "thus , we have shown that the two - loop diagrams with only one massless internal line involving the states with the @xmath38 quantum numbers indeed add up to zero .",
    "the above discussion implies that non - vanishing diagrams with only one massless internal line must be such that the corresponding massless states carry the @xmath42 quantum numbers . in the following",
    ", we will evaluate these diagrams ; they involve one massless internal line with the @xmath42 quantum numbers plus heavy kk lines with @xmath276 quantum numbers . the computation can actually be simplified by relating the corresponding diagrams in the @xmath0 theory to their @xmath1 counterparts .",
    "let us therefore consider these @xmath1 diagrams which we will refer to as @xmath277 . in the @xmath0 language",
    "this @xmath1 diagram can be written as : @xmath278 note that by the @xmath268 symmetry we have @xmath279 , and @xmath280 .",
    "on the other hand , the above @xmath1 diagram vanishes : @xmath281 .",
    "this implies that @xmath282    let us now extract the corresponding @xmath0 diagrams , which we will refer to as @xmath283 , surviving the orbifold projection . since @xmath284 is projected out by the @xmath33 orbifold , we have @xmath285 thus , we see that non - vanishing diagrams of this type are the same as those in @xmath0 supersymmetric qed ( with massive charged superfields ) .",
    "note that the corresponding diagram with all massless internal lines is given by @xmath286 also , in practice , we found it most convenient to start from the original @xmath1 diagrams and subtract the contributions involving @xmath284 component of the vector multiplet , _",
    "i.e. _ , the scalar photon and one of the two photinos .",
    "thus , in particular , we eliminated the contributions of scalar photons in @xmath250 and @xmath249 by subtracting the corresponding polarization components of the @xmath241 gauge boson , and adjusted the overall factor in @xmath251 to eliminate the redundant photino propagator .",
    "first , we write down the final result for purely massless diagrams , with all internal lines corresponding to @xmath287 : @xmath288~,\\ ] ] where @xmath289 is the euler s constant .",
    "it is easy to check that the coefficient of the @xmath246 pole does correctly reproduce the two - loop coefficient of @xmath0 supersymmetric qed .",
    "the diagrams involving only one massless propagator are given by more complicated expressions involving feynman parameter integrals such as in ( [ scalar ] ) .",
    "however in the most interesting `` low energy , large radius '' limit , @xmath290 , these integrals simplify and the result can be written as a momentum - independent correction : @xmath291+\\delta^{\\bf m}~.\\label{pip}\\ ] ] in the above expression we have isolated the contribution @xmath292~,\\ ] ] which arises from the diagrams involving self - energy corrections to internal lines , and contains the uv divergence associated with the mass renormalization at the one - loop level . the finite part of @xmath293 should be combined with the one - loop threshold correction .",
    "it renormalizes the mass scale of the kk excitations , _",
    "i.e. _ , the compactification radius @xmath20 , or , equivalently , the number @xmath26 of the kk excitations below the uv cut - off scale . on the other hand , the first term in ( [ pip ] ) represents a genuine two - loop threshold correction proportional to the two - loop @xmath103-function of @xmath0 supersymmetric theory describing @xmath1 kk excitations coupled to the @xmath0 massless gauge sector .",
    "note that in the above two - loop expression for the heavy kk threshold contributions to the gauge coupling renormalization the summation over the kk momenta @xmath81 is cut - off from above by @xmath258 .",
    "after the summation the leading two - loop threshold is of order @xmath294 , which is subleading compared with the leading one - loop threshold correction @xmath234 .",
    "in this section we would like to discuss various issues which , we believe , have important implications in phenomenological applications of gauge coupling unification via kaluza - klein thresholds .",
    "some of these points have been previously stressed in @xcite , while some others are new and concern various developments subsequent to @xcite .",
    "one of the key points we would like to emphasize is that supersymmetry is crucial for the arguments of section iv to go through . in particular , without supersymmetry ,",
    "namely , without @xmath1 supersymmetry at the heavy kk levels , the cancellations leading to the fact that higher loop corrections to the gauge couplings are suppressed compared with the leading one - loop threshold contribution would not be possible .",
    "that is , in the context of kk compactifications of higher dimensional theories without supersymmetry the very idea of gauge coupling unification via kaluza - klein thresholds would have no predictive power - higher loop corrections in such a setup would be as large as one - loop thresholds , hence no control over the former .    even in the supersymmetric case",
    "the fact that higher loop corrections are subleading compared with the one - loop thresholds is only specific to gauge coupling renormalization .",
    "thus , the same does _ not _ hold for higher point couplings .",
    "in particular , the yukawa couplings receive large higher loop corrections , and therefore one no longer has predictions for yukawa coupling unification such as the @xmath295 unification .",
    "since supersymmetry at the heavy kk levels is so crucial , one has to worry about the effects of supersymmetry breaking which must eventually take place .",
    "thus , the supersymmetry breaking scale ( by which we mean the typical scale of soft scalar masses ) must be low enough compared with the kk threshold scale @xmath23 or else the corrections due to supersymmetry breaking at the heavy kk levels would be too large and spoil the above mentioned cancellations due to @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "this implies that the the string scale @xmath296 can not really be brought down to a few tev in this context .",
    "( in the particular model of @xcite the relation between the string scale @xmath16 and the kk threshold @xmath23 is fixed by the unification constraint to be @xmath297 in the case of d4-branes , and @xmath298 in the case of d5-branes . ) in fact , these considerations suggest that the string scale can not be lower than @xmath25 .    to implement gauge coupling unification via kaluza - klein thresholds in the phenomenological context a concrete model is required .",
    "such a model , which in @xcite was called tssm ( tev - scale supersymmetric standard model ) , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was stressed in @xcite that this model was the only solution to the unification constraints found in @xcite .",
    "here we would like to discuss some issues concerning this point .",
    "first , in the mssm the gauge coupling running is given by : @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the unified gauge coupling , @xmath301 @xcite is the unification scale , and @xmath302 , @xmath303 , are the @xmath304 @xmath103-function coefficients ( @xmath305 , @xmath306 , @xmath307 , where we have used the standard normalization @xmath308 ) . in order for the ( one - loop ) unification via the kk thresholds to be just as precise as in the mssm",
    ", it is required that the @xmath1 @xmath103-function coefficients @xmath120 at the massive kk levels ( see section iii ) satisfy the following relation : @xmath309 this condition is satisfied in the tssm .",
    "in fact , in the tssm we have @xmath310 .",
    "as was explained in @xcite , the tssm was the only solution found there for the unification constraint ( [ nu ] ) .",
    "here we point out that the key assumption here is that all three gauge subgroups of @xmath304 come from the _ same _ set of coincident branes . in this case in the string theory context we expect all three gauge couplings to be the same at the string scale ( which is identified with the unification scale ) .",
    "recently , in @xcite a set of models different from the tssm was discussed . according to @xcite , in these models the ( one - loop ) gauge coupling unification is as precise as in the mssm ( and , therefore , tssm ) . here",
    ", however , we would like to point out that there is _ no _ unifications in the models of @xcite .",
    "the point here is that in @xcite additional `` solutions '' to the unification constraints were found by relaxing the requirement that all the gauge subgroups come from the same set of coincident branes .",
    "for instance , _",
    "a priori _ one could imagine that @xmath311 subgroups are localized on the same set of coincident d@xmath3-branes ( with @xmath111 ) , while @xmath312 is localized on a fixed point of the orbifold ( such localization , for instance , could be achieved by having other branes stuck at the orbifold fixed points in the corresponding compact directions ) . however , in such cases the gauge couplings of @xmath311 on the one hand , and @xmath312 on the other hand generically are _ not _ expected to be the same at the string scale . in certain cases equality of these gauge couplings can be achieved by some fine tuning , but there is _ no _ unification prediction here . in this sense",
    "such a scenario is no different from that proposed in @xcite where various subgroups of the standard model gauge group come from different sets of branes ( and then unification requires fine tuning of the corresponding compactification volumes ) .",
    "thus , the tssm of @xcite ( along with its straightforward variations ) is indeed the only known solution that satisfied the unification constraints .",
    "here another remark is in order .",
    "note that the consistent orbifold reduction of a higher dimensional gauge theory requires that the heavy kk spectrum is @xmath1 supersymmetric .",
    "moreover , suppose we have chiral multiplets @xmath38 at the massless level .",
    "then at the massive level we must have the corresponding hypermultiplet ( we have been referring to these hypermultiplets as @xmath36 ) for _ each _ massless chiral multiplet ( with certain degeneracy depending on the order @xmath34 of the orbifold group @xmath33 and the choice of @xmath110 ) .",
    "this requirement , which is necessary for the consistency ( in particular , unitarity ) of the theory at the heavy kk levels is _ not _ met by the models of @xcite .",
    "thus , these models are not completely consistent .",
    "similarly , albeit the unification is not a property in models of @xcite , some care is needed when considering such constructions . in particular ,",
    "if , say , @xmath312 is localized on a fixed point of the orbifold , so must be _ all _ the matter fields charged under @xmath312 ( which is _ not _ the case in some of the models of @xcite ) - this is the consequence of the corresponding flux conservation requirement .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the `` uv sensitivity '' issue in the context of gauge coupling unification via kaluza - klein thresholds .",
    "thus , naively it might seem that a small shift in the low energy gauge couplings would spoil the unification prediction ( whose sensitivity to such shifts is power - like ) , and therefore the gauge coupling unification is too `` uv sensitive '' to be predictive .",
    "however , such a viewpoint might be a bit misleading .",
    "thus , consider the tssm .",
    "if the unification occurs in the mssm , then it also occurs in the tssm , and just as precisely ( at one loop ) as in the mssm .",
    "higher loop corrections , as we have shown in this paper , are small .",
    "this implies that such a unification scenario is predictive in the context of a concrete model , namely , the tssm .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the tssm _ explains _",
    "@xcite why the usual logarithmic unification in the mssm is not an accident ( assuming that the tssm is the correct description of physics above the electroweak scale ) , but is rather related to the lack of experimental data which prompts one to assume the standard `` desert scenario '' and extrapolate the gauge couplings all the way to the gut scale @xmath313 .",
