    "indeed , ideal insulating behavior requires that all half - filling states carry no charge current .",
    "however , we note that out of the three types of charge @xmath0-spin - triplet elementary excitations of @xmath0-spin projections @xmath189 , the states with projection @xmath190 are indeed half - filling states .",
    "our results show that such charge @xmath0-spin - triplet states carry finite charge current both in the strong and weak coupling limits . according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , this implies a finite value for the charge stiffness @xmath191 at finite temperatures @xmath1 .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with the studies of ref .",
    "@xcite , which lead to a finite value for @xmath192 at half filling and @xmath1 .",
    "however , such studies did not take into account the @xmath193 and @xmath194 states which carry the charge current at half filling and lead to @xmath195 for @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , both the studies of the present paper and the related studies of ref .",
    "@xcite provide strong evidence that the @xmath196 and @xmath197 states considered in ref .",
    "@xcite do not carry charge current and do not contribute to @xmath192 .",
    "the model studied here is integrable and according to the general arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite should display ideal insulating behavior at half filling .",
    "that issue is clarified elsewhere by study of the microscopic mechanism which is behind the half - filling properties concerning transport of charge @xcite .",
    "finally , our results reveal the occurrence of charge - spin separation at finite energies , since some of the elementary excitations studied here have an energy gap relative to the initial ground state .",
    "such a finite - energy charge - spin separation deserves further studies .",
    "we note that the photoemission studies of ref . @xcite",
    "have detected a spin - charge separation in quasi-1d compounds for the whole energy bandwidth .",
