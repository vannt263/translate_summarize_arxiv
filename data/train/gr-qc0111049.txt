    "the black and wormholes @xcite of asymptotically ads 3d gravity are of great interest , not only because this is a large , non - trivial , yet explicitly constructible class of spacetimes .",
    "these spacetimes can also be expected to play a fundamental role in the would be theory of quantum 3d gravity , as some of its building blocks . in this paper",
    "we study an analytic continuation procedure that gives an explicit construction of a euclidean asymptotically ads manifold corresponding to a black or wormhole .",
    "such a procedure was initially described in @xcite for the case of non - rotating spacetimes . in the present paper",
    "we generalize it to the rotating case .",
    "there are several motivations for the analytic continuation construction .",
    "the most obvious one is the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "one obtains the thermodynamic partition function of a black hole as the path integral over the euclidean metrics .",
    "as we shall see , the analytic continuation also helps to classify the black and wormhole spacetimes .",
    "finally , there are also reasons to expect that an analytic continuation procedure will play an important role in a construction of the lorentzian quantum theory .    before we describe the main idea of our procedure ,",
    "let us remind the reader some basic facts about black holes and wormholes in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "these spacetimes generalize the btz bh @xcite .",
    "it is easiest to describe the non - rotating case . then there is a plane of time symmetry , which we shall call the @xmath0 surface .",
    "the geometry of a spacetime is most conveniently described by looking at this surface .",
    "thus , a non - rotating btz bh has two asymptotic regions and its @xmath0 plane has the geometry of an infinite throat connecting the two regions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bh](a ) .",
    "more interesting spacetimes can be constructed , see @xcite .",
    "for example , as the @xmath0 surface geometry one can have a single asymptotic region glued to a torus , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bh](b ) . or , instead , one can have three asymptotic regions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bh](c ) .",
    "the geometries described are just simplest examples .",
    "more generally one can have any number of asymptotic regions connected by a system of throats , with possibly handles hidden behind the horizons .",
    "the corresponding spacetimes are constructed from ads@xmath1 by identifying points with respect to the action of some discrete group of isometries , see more on this below .",
    "in @xcite we have proposed that there is a natural way to analytically continue the described spacetimes to the euclidean signature , at least in the non - rotating case .",
    "the idea in @xcite was as follows .",
    "the group @xmath2 used to obtain a wormhole is a subgroup of a certain diagonal @xmath3 .",
    "but such @xmath2 can also be thought of as a subgroup of @xmath4 , which is the isometry group of the euclidean ads .",
    "thus , one can use _ the same _ identifications , but now thought of as transformations of the euclidean ads , to obtain a constant negative curvature 3d manifold .",
    "the corresponding euclidean manifolds turned out to be handlebodies . for examples , both the single asymptotic region wormhole fig .",
    "[ fig : bh](b ) and the three asymptotic regions black hole fig .",
    "[ fig : bh](c ) correspond in the euclidean signature to solid 2-handled spheres .    before we explain how this procedure can be generalized to the case of rotating spacetimes ,",
    "let us make few comments .",
    "first , we have to emphasize that the construction proposed in this paper is not the standard analytic continuation procedure in which one continues an appropriate time coordinate .",
    "our construction only works in the case of 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "it is in this case that there are no local degrees of freedom , and all spacetimes are locally indistinguishable from the maximally symmetric one , and thus obtainable from it by discrete identifications .",
    "this raises a possibility of `` analytically continuing '' the discrete groups one uses , not the time coordinate .",
    "second , let us compare our prescription to the more standard continuation of the time coordinate .",
    "when one has a global time kvf in a spacetime , as is the case for the btz bh , the result of our procedure coincides with what one gets by continuing the time coordinate . in the case of a spacetime with several asymptotic regions no global time",
    "kvf is present , see @xcite for a discussion of this .",
    "however , each asymptotic region is identical to the asymptotic region of btz bh of some mass and angular momentum .",
    "thus , one could attempt to analytically continue the metric in each asymptotic region separately .",
    "as is usual with the analytic continuation of bh spacetimes , the region behind the horizons `` disappears '' , and the resulting euclidean space is a number of disconnected copies of the euclidean btz bh , that is solid tori . in contrast",
    ", what one gets as a result of our procedure is a connected space , whose boundary is some connected riemann surface . which of these two analytic continuations is the `` correct '' one depends on how one wants to use the resulting euclidean spaces .",
    "we make more comments on this in the sequel .",
    "for now we note that from the point of view of holography it is natural to have the boundary of the euclidean space a connected surface .",
    "indeed , one expects to have non - zero correlations between the asymptotic regions of a spacetime , so that a thermal state comes from tracing a pure state over the degrees of freedom of all asymptotic regions but one . in the framework of holography",
    "such correlations are naturally incorporated via the field theory living on a connected boundary of the euclidean space . for us",
    "this serves as a strong motivation to prefer the procedure of continuing the discrete groups to the procedure of analytically continuing each of the asymptotic regions separately .",
    "let us now describe the main idea of our procedure .",
    "the idea is to `` analytically continue '' the discrete group @xmath5 to a subgroup @xmath6 .",
    "then a spacetime that is obtained from the lorentzian ads@xmath1 by identifying points with respect to the action of @xmath2 corresponds to a 3d hyperbolic space @xmath7 . to see why such an analytic continuation is possible , and , in fact , natural ,",
    "let us recall that the lie algebra of @xmath4 can be split into the selfdual and anti - selfdual commuting parts .",
    "then any @xmath4 transformation can be represented as a composition of two transformations .",
    "in fact , this is the usual construction of the vector representation of the lorentz group out of the fundamental and anti - fundamental one .",
    "one constructs a @xmath8 matrix @xmath9 that realizes the fundamental representation .",
    "the matrix @xmath9 is exactly the `` selfdual part '' of a lorentz transformation .",
    "the vector representation is then @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a unitary @xmath8 matrix constructed out of the coordinates of @xmath12 , see more on this in the appendix .",
    "any @xmath4 transformation can be represented this way .",
    "this means that the isometry group in the euclidean case can be given the same product structure as in the lorentzian signature .",
    "one can thus analytically continue each of @xmath13 s of the lorentzian group of isometries into a selfdual ( anti - selfdual ) part of @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure can actually be carried out for simple spacetimes , like that of btz black hole , see the main text . however , for more complicated black holes the procedure becomes ineffective in that it is rather hard to see what the final euclidean space is . in the present paper we also develop a more effective description using quasi - conformal mappings and quasi - fuchsian groups .",
    "the main idea is that the group @xmath14 can be obtained as a certain deformation of the fuchsian group @xmath2 of the non - rotating spacetime .",
    "namely , we construct @xmath14 as the so - called fenchel - nielsen deformation @xcite of the non - rotating group @xmath2 .",
    "we show that , at least infinitesimally , the angular velocity is related to the fenchel - nielsen twist .",
    "however , to explain this result we will need to introduce a large amount of background material , which we do in the main text .",
    "in this paper we do not consider an important problem of analytically continuing the green s functions .",
    "this problem has to be faced if one wants to do quantum field theory in black hole spacetimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we remind the reader how the non - rotating spacetimes are constructed , and explain how they can be analytically continued to the euclidean signature .",
    "section [ sec : rot - lor ] gives some necessary background on the rotating spacetimes .",
    "finally , the analytic continuation for the rotating case is described in section [ sec : rot - eucl ] .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "we start by reviewing how non - rotating black and wormholes are constructed @xcite and how they can be analytically continued to the euclidean signature @xcite .",
    "most of this section is a review of the material contained in the above references .",
    "the only new part is contained at the end : we explain why the geometry of the boundary of the euclidean space is that of the schottky double of the time symmetry plane geometry .",
    "let us start by reminding the reader some very basic facts about the lorentzian ads@xmath1 , out of which more complicated spaces will be obtained by identifications of points .",
    "the spacetime is best viewed as the interior of an infinite cylinder .",
    "the cylinder itself is the conformal boundary @xmath15 of the spacetime .",
    "it is timelike , unlike the null conformal boundary of an asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "all light rays propagating inside ads start and end on @xmath15 . in this picture",
    "the constant time slices are copies of the poincare ( unit ) disc .",
    "the unit disc is isometric to the upper half plane @xmath16 ; we shall use both models .",
    "the isometry group of the lorentzian signature ads@xmath1 is @xmath17 .",
    "the spacetimes itself can be viewed as the @xmath13 group manifold , and the isometry group action is just the left and right multiplication .",
    "more details on ads@xmath1 are given in the appendix .",
    "let us now turn to the black hole spacetimes . the description of the non - rotating black holes is greatly facilitated by the fact that there is a surface @xmath0 of time symmetry .",
    "this surface is preserved by the discrete group @xmath2 one uses to identify points .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is actually a subgroup of the group @xmath18 that fixes the @xmath0 plane .",
    "this `` diagonal '' @xmath13 consists of transformations of the form @xmath19 , where we imply the model of ads@xmath1 as the @xmath13 group manifold , see the appendix .",
    "note that this is not the usual diagonal @xmath13 consisting of transformations @xmath20 , which fixes the origin of ads@xmath1 .",
    "transformations fixing the @xmath0 plane act on it by isometries .",
    "thus , the geometry of the surface @xmath0 is that of the quotient of the unit disc by the action of @xmath21 .",
    "such 2d geometries were an object of an active study by mathematicians for the last hundred years .",
    "once the geometry of the @xmath0 plane is understood one just `` evolves '' the identifications in time to obtain a spacetime , see @xcite .",
    "let us see how this works on examples .",
    "consider first the case of the non - rotating btz bh . in this case",
    "the discrete group is generated by a single hyperbolic element .",
    "its action on the @xmath0 plane can be understood by finding the so - called fundamental region .",
    "the fundamental region @xmath22 of the unit disc @xmath16 for group @xmath2 is such that any point on @xmath16 can be obtained as an image of a point in @xmath22 under a transformation from @xmath2 , and such that no two points of @xmath22 ( except on its boundary ) are related . in the case of @xmath2 generated by a single element @xmath23",
    "the fundamental region is that between two geodesics on @xmath24 mapped into one another by the generator @xmath23 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : btz](a ) .",
    "it is clear that the quotient space has the topology of the @xmath25 wormhole with two asymptotic regions , each having the topology of @xmath26 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : btz](b ) .",
    "the btz angular coordinate runs from one geodesics to the other .",
    "the distance between the two geodesics measured along their common normal is precisely the horizon circumference .",
    "one can obtain the spacetime geometry of this black hole by `` evolving '' in time the @xmath0 slice geometry . in this evolution ,",
    "the two geodesics on the initial slice evolve into geodesic surfaces in the spacetime , which are then to be identified .",
    "the region between them , after identifications , is the btz black hole spacetime , see fig .",
    "[ fig : btz - st ] . because timelike geodesics in ads are `` attracted '' to each other",
    ", the two geodesic surfaces will finally cross .",
    "this is where the spacetime `` ends '' .",
    "note , however , that the time it takes for them to meet each other is finite only in the global ads time coordinate . in btz time",
    "coordinate the corresponding `` singularities '' are at past and future infinity .",
    "the asymptotic infinity of the btz black hole consists of two regions on the ads boundary cylinder .",
    "these are the regions between the timelike geodesics on the boundary ; the geodesics are identified .",
    "one can now construct the past of the asymptotic region to convince oneself that there is a region in this spacetime that is causally disconnected from the infinity , see fig .",
    "[ fig : btz - st ] .",
    "this region is the black ( white ) hole , and its boundary is the event horizon .",

    "@xmath78 is the btz bh angular momentum .",
    "the above example shows that , at least in the btz case , the angular velocity can be expressed directly in terms of the euclidean generator @xmath107 .",

    "so far we have only seen how the procedure ( [ map ] ) works for a group @xmath14 generated by a single generator , which is the btz case . in the general case one",

    "we have seen that non - rotating spacetimes give , in the euclidean signature , the groups @xmath14 that consists of only real elements .",

    "this correspondence only holds for a cyclic group @xmath2 , that is for the btz case .",
    "however , certain other relation is still valid even in the general case .",
    "recall that the angular velocity @xmath46 was expressed ( [ omega ] ) as the ratio of the imaginary and real parts of the muliplier of the transformation @xmath107 generating the asymptotic region .",
    "the above discussion suggests that we have to identify @xmath107 with the deformation of @xmath207 due to a twist .",

    "setting @xmath227 we see that , for an infinitesimal twist , @xmath228 of @xmath211 can be expressed through the real part of the period . recalling ( [ omega ] ) we get : @xmath229 in case when @xmath2 is cyclic @xmath230 , the period can be easily computed .",
    "one gets @xmath231 .",
    "this means that for a cyclic group , like the one of the btz bh , the angular velocity is simply the fenchel - nielsen twist @xmath232 . for",
    "a general group the period does not seem to be computable in any explicit way , and the relation between the angular velocity and the twist parameter becomes more complicated ( [ omega - twist ] ) .",
    "it still , however , admits a simple interpretation .",
    "indeed , since @xmath233 is the schwarzian derivative of the twist map @xmath226 , it can be interpreted as the ( holomorphic part of the ) stress - energy tensor of a cft .",
    "then ( [ omega - twist ] ) is just the higher genus version of the standard cft formula : @xmath234 here @xmath235 is the conformal dimension , which is related to the angular momentum as @xmath236 , and the angular momentum is @xmath237 .",
    "our expression for the angular velocity ( [ omega - twist ] ) is consistent with this cft interpretation .    with the result ( [ omega - twist ] )",
    "at hand we are finally ready to formulate the prescription for the analytic continuation .",

    "the quasi - conformal map is the one that corresponds to the fenchel - nielsen deformation . under the quasi - conformal map",

    "the surface @xmath30 is of the same genus as in the non - rotting case .",
    "its moduli space is in one - to - one correspondence with the parameter space of our spacetime . in particular ,",
    "the horizon size is given by the length of a particular geodesic on @xmath30 , and the horizon angular velocity is given by the period ( [ omega - twist ] ) of a certain quadratic differential ( poincare series ) along the geodesic .",
    "the expression ( [ omega - twist ] ) is valid for infinitesimal twists . for a finite twist one",
    "has to use the expression ( [ omega ] ) . finally , let us note that @xmath30 can be thought of as the schottky double of @xmath29 even in the rotating case . in this case the anti - holomorphic map @xmath248 is given by the inversion in the jordan curve",
    "thus , our analytic continuation procedure is that of continuing the discrete groups .",
    "one has to start from a non - rotating bh , with its discrete group being a subgroup of @xmath13 and the analytic continuation being trivial .",
    "one should then turn on the rotation , which deforms the discrete group @xmath2 into a subgroup @xmath247 of @xmath4 .",
    "the angular velocity of an asymptotic region is given by a certain period , see ( [ omega - twist ] ) .",
    "we established this identification for infinitesimal twists .",
    "for a finite deformation the angular velocity of an asymptotic region is given by ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "for a cyclic group @xmath2 the angular velocity is essentially the twist @xmath232 .",
    "it could be that this also holds for a general group , which would be the case if @xmath249 for a general @xmath2 .",
    "we were not able to establish or disprove this .",
    "if this is not true , the best one has for a finite twist would be the formula ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "our construction solves the problem of classification of rotating wormhole spacetimes .",
    "indeed , similarly to the non - rotating case , in which bh s are classified by their @xmath0 plane geometry , the rotating spacetimes are classified by the conformal geometry of the boundary of the corresponding euclidean spaces .",
    "moduli of this eucildean boundary are in correspondence with the bh parameters . in particular ,",
    "the horizon angular velocities are given by ( [ omega ] ) , where @xmath107 are group generators that project to the horizon geodesics .",
    "let us conclude with a few comments as to the thermodynamics of black and wormhole spacetimes . given a spacetime",
    "one can construct the corresponding euclidean manifold using our analytic continuation procedure .",
    "the manifold @xmath240 is a handlebody .",
    "one can then evaluate the partition function , which is the value of the euclidean einstein - hilbert action on @xmath240 .",
    "this problem was studied in @xcite .",
    "the calculation involves a particular regularization procedure .",
    "ofter this is done , the value of the partition function is show to be given by the liouville action evaluated on the canonical ( poincare ) liouville field , see @xcite .",
    "thus , the partition function @xmath250 is a particular function of the moduli of the euclidean boundary @xmath30 . as was shown in @xcite , @xmath250 is the kahler potential for the weyl - peterson symplectic structure on the teichmuller space @xmath182",
    ". then one can take the length @xmath203 and the angular momentum @xmath46 ( [ omega ] ) of the geodesics corresponding to asymptotic regions as part of the moduli .",
    "one can then form out of @xmath251 the intensive thermodynamic quantities : the inverse temperature @xmath217 and the parameter @xmath252 conjugate to the angular momentum @xmath78 .",
    "then the derivative of @xmath253 with respect to @xmath217 and @xmath252 should give the mass @xmath240 and the angular momentum @xmath78 correspondingly .",
    "this is a non - trivial differential equation on @xmath250 , and thus on the liouville action .",
    "then , performing the legendre transform to the variables @xmath254 for every asymptotic region , one should find that the result of the transform ( entropy ) is given by the sum of length @xmath203 of all boundary geodesics of @xmath29 .",
    "this is another very non - trivial equation @xmath250 has to satisfy .",
    "thus , the black hole interpretation of riemann surfaces leads us to conjecture some rather non - trivial identities for the kahler potential @xmath255 on the teichmuller space @xmath182 .",
