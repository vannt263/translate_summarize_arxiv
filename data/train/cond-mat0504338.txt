    "it catches the main features of the random growth and is quite simple in definition . but",
    "this model however is still not solved analytically more than twenty years after its introduction  @xcite .",
    "direct simulations of the original model and calculations using the conformal - mapping technique  @xcite are the two main methods for investigating dla structures .",
    "it is commonly believed that dla clusters are random fractals  @xcite , and the accepted estimate for the fractal dimension is @xmath0 .",
    "the analytic result  @xcite predicts @xmath1 in agreement with the numerical estimates .",
    "the surface of a dla cluster demonstrates the multifractal properties obtained in simulations  @xcite and supported analytically  @xcite .",
    "several groups claim dla clusters have multiscaling properties  @xcite : that the penetration depth @xmath2 is scaled differently from the deposition radius @xmath3 and that a whole set of scaling exponents exists within the framework of multiscaling .",
    "recently , these claims were doubted in papers by somfai , ball , bowler , and sander  @xcite .    the off - lattice killing - free algorithm , our implementation of the dla algorithm , allows generating a large number of huge clusters and calculating the fractal dimensions of the quantities mentioned above .",
    "our numerical results do not support the arguments presented in  @xcite but favor the early results  @xcite .",
    "the multiscaling that was `` suspected '' in those papers was attributed in  @xcite to the strong lattice - size effects they advocated , with the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath4 .",
    "we do not find any evidence for that in our data .",
    "instead , we prefer to attribute the spreading of the fractal dimension values as estimated from the different quantities to the weak - self - averaging of the fractal dimension .",
    "its relative fluctuation decays with the number of particles approximately as @xmath5 with @xmath6 for the large cluster sizes , i.e , with the exponent about three times smaller than would be expected for the usual averaging of the quantity .",
    "thus one can expect large fluctuations of the fractal dimension as estimated from the different quantities , with different methods , and from different cluster sizes .",
    "the alternative and more naive view is to say that the last exponent is also evidence for the multiscaling properties of dla cluster .",
    "our algorithm is off - lattice with memory organization similar to one used in the ball and brady algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the main differences are : ( i ) we use only two layers in the memory hierarchy , which seems optimal for reducing memory usage , keeping the overall efficiency of simulations high ; ( ii ) we use bit - mapping for the second layer of memory to reduce the total memory used by the simulation program ; ( iii ) we use large walk steps . the new feature is the recursive algorithm for the free zone tracking .",
    "the essential feature of our algorithm is that we modified the rule for the particles that go far from the cluster .",
    "we never kill any particle at the outer circle but return them to the birth circle  @xcite with an evaluated probability .",
    "this procedure eliminates the effect of the potential distortion ( and thus of the cluster harmonic measure ) , keeping our algorithm in the same universality class .    in this paper",
    "we present all details of our algorithm .",
    "we believe that some details may be important both for understanding the results and for comparing the results properly .",
    "we briefly discuss the essentials of our implementation of the off - lattice killing - free algorithm in section  [ sec - alg ] , accompanied with some technical details on the derivation of the return - on - birth - circle probability given in appendix  [ sec - prob ] and details on the memory model in appendix  [ sec - mem ] .",

    "( 6 ) the cluster memory is updated .",
    "steps from ( 2 ) through ( 6 ) are repeated @xmath10 times .",
    "the difference from the traditional dla algorithm is in step 4 .",
    "we remind the reader that in the original algorithm , a particle is killed when it crosses @xmath11 and the new one starts a walk from a random position on the circle @xmath7 , i.e , at the position @xmath12 .",
    "clearly , the rule being perfect in the limit @xmath13 will influence the growth stability when @xmath11 is finite .",
    "instead , if particle crosses @xmath11 to a position with @xmath14 , we use the probability  @xcite as determined by expression  ( [ prob - norm ] ) in appendix a with @xmath15 to obtain new particle position .",

    "we divide the whole ensemble with 100 clusters into five independent groups .",
    "averaging over each group gives five different curves for @xmath41 , which exhibit strong fluctuations .",

    ". this quantity averaged over the ensemble of @xmath47 clusters is plotted in figure  [ fig - d - harm ] as a function of the system size @xmath48 .",
    "it exhibits some `` oscillation '' around the value 1.708 , which is very close to the accepted dla fractal dimension .",

    "it was long discussed that dla clusters are not simple fractals  @xcite and , for example , that the fractal dimension depends continuously on the normalized distance from the cluster origin  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in  @xcite that the density of particles at a distance @xmath28 from the origin obeys the equation @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , with a nontrivial ( non constant ) multiscaling exponent @xmath56 ( lines with open symbols in figure  [ d_x ] ) .",
    "quite recently , somfai et al .",
    "@xcite claimed that the multiscaling picture is wrong and is misled by finite - size transients .",
    "they argued for a strong dependence of the radius estimators ( @xmath60 , etc .",
    ", see table  [ tab - cor ] ) on the system size expr .",
    "( [ correction ] ) , where the leading subdominant exponent is estimated as @xmath61 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the fractal dimension @xmath56 can be found using the probability @xmath62 for the n - th particle to be deposited within a shell of width @xmath63 at a distance @xmath28 from the seed .",
    "the simplest and most obvious form of the probability is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is gaussian .",
    "practically , the gaussian distribution can be obtained by averaging over a large number of clusters . for the single - cluster realization",
    "this function has some particular form reflecting the details of the cluster growth as shown in figure  [ probab ] , in which each local maximum is associated with an actively growing branch .    in  @xcite somfai",
    "et al . computed @xmath56 from the gaussian probability @xmath62 , and @xmath56 with corrections to scaling coincides well with the numerical results of amitrano et al .",
    "somfai et all state that @xmath56 tends to a constant value as @xmath66 . in other words ,",
    "somfai et al .",
    "advocate that multiscaling is transient and is an artifact of the finite size of the dla clusters .",
    "in contrast , our numerical results demonstrate that ( 1 )  there is no evidence for the finite - size corrections with the exponent @xmath67 , ( 2 )  @xmath56 seems not tend to a constant , and ( 3 )  it is not correct to use the gaussian probability @xmath62 to compute @xmath56 for the dla model .",
    "gaussian distribution does not reflect details of the dla cluster because it is the outcome of the the averaging over a large number of clusters .",
    "after such averaging all details of the random nature of the growth of a particular cluster are washed out , and the gaussian distribution is just the result of the central limit theorem .",
    "there are some indications by hastings  @xcite , who computed dla fractal dimension from field theory , that the gaussian distribution by itself is insufficient for describing dla clusters , and some noise must be added to obtain a model corresponding to the dla model . to some extent , the local maxima in figure  [ probab ]",
    "are due to that noise , in contrast to the distribution averaged over the cluster ensemble , which is smooth .",
    "accordingly , @xmath56 calculated from the averaged distribution would be constant in the limit of large @xmath10 .",
    "we can therefore say that multiscaling comes from the fluctuations ( natural noise ) of the dla cluster growth process .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath56 for different cluster sizes are shown in figure  [ d_x ] together with the results from  @xcite .",
    "there is a notable maximum in @xmath56 at around @xmath68 , and its size does not change significantly with the number of particles in a cluster .",
    "we note that the position of the maximum can be found from the ratio of @xmath69 to @xmath20 . in our simulations , it equals @xmath70 , which coincides well with the data in figure  [ d_x ] .    ; solid squares , @xmath71 ; stars , @xmath72 ; solid circles , limit of our data for @xmath73 ; open symbols are from  @xcite ; open squares , @xmath74 square lattice ; open circles , @xmath75 off - lattice . ]",
    "the maximum seems to occur because growth is mostly completed in the region @xmath76 , and the fractal dimension @xmath56 decrease to the left of @xmath77 in the actively growing region @xmath56 because of the lack of particles there . for small @xmath78 , i.e. , for @xmath79",
    ", no new particles are being added , and @xmath56 is the same for different cluster sizes .",
    "we note that the prediction of somfai et al . for @xmath56 with a system size @xmath71 is quite smaller than the one computed by us and presented in figure  [ d_x ] .",
    "we also estimate limit of the three curves plotted in fig .",
    "[ d_x ] , taking limit of @xmath80 at the fixed value of @xmath78 , and plot result with the solid circles in fig .",
    "thus , our data does not demonstrate tendency of @xmath56 to a constant value , and rather support our observation that the dynamic growth of the cluster is dominated by the active zone , and maximum in @xmath56 reflects this nature of dla . at the same time we have to note that accuracy of the data presented here is not enough for the final decision , and future investigation with the higher accuracy have to be still done .",
    "we have implemented modifications to the dla algorithm that help us to grow large dla clusters and test some recent claims about its properties . in our experiments , aggregates do not exhibit corrections to scaling laws .",
    "nevertheless , the results show multiscaling properties .",
    "this means that there should be another way for such a clusters to appear .",
    "we tried to analyze the processes responsible for multiscaling .",

    "the same expression was obtained earlier   in refs .",
    "we found our result is still worth publishing , since we derive it from a different point of view .",
    "for a particle to stick at the distance @xmath28 , computed for a single dla cluster . ]",
    "we consider a particle at some position @xmath81 outside circle of radius @xmath7 , @xmath82 .",
    "the particle moves randomly , and its size and step is much smaller than @xmath28 and @xmath7 . the question is what is the probability for a particle to intersect the circle @xmath7 at the angle @xmath9 . clearly , for the particles walking from infinity , i.e. , @xmath83 , that distribution is uniform in @xmath84 $ ] :    @xmath85    the conformal map @xmath86 maps infinity to @xmath87 and the unit circle to the circle of radius @xmath7 .",
    "transformation  ( [ map ] ) changes probability  ( [ prob - uni ] ) to the modulus of derivative of the conformal map ,    @xmath88    substituting @xmath89 in ( [ map - der ] ) , we obtain the resulting probability @xmath90 as a function of the ratio @xmath91 . this is a probability for the particle beginning its walk at the point @xmath87 outside @xmath7 to intersect circle @xmath92 at the angle @xmath9 ( see figure  [ fig - prob ] ) .     of the walk intersection of the circle @xmath7 with the initial position of the particle at @xmath87 . ]",
    "the constant in  ( [ prob - non ] ) is associated with the probability for the particle to move to infinity .",
    "it can be identified using the analogy between the dla model and laplacian growth as was pointed in  @xcite for the dielectric breakdown model , which is a generalization of the dla model .",
    "the probability that the particle sticks somewhere to the cluster is proportional to the electrical field at that point .",
    "we consider three circles of radii @xmath93 , @xmath19 , and @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "the external circles @xmath93 and @xmath94 are set under the potential @xmath96 , and particles stick one of them .",
    "the circle @xmath19 ( place of a birth for particles ) is set with @xmath97 .",
    "the solution of the laplace equation @xmath98 with the above boundary conditions gives the distribution of the potential and thus of the electrical field @xmath99 .",
    "the probability for the particle to stick on the circle @xmath93 would be @xmath100 and similarly for @xmath101 .",
    "the ratio of these probabilities is : @xmath102 the probability @xmath101 vanishes as @xmath103 : @xmath104 .",
    "this means that all particles starting on the birth radius should irreversibly collide with a cluster and the constant in  ( [ prob - non ] ) is easily found by normalizing the probability , @xmath105 .",
    "the final expression for the probability @xmath106 provides correct values for both the limits @xmath107 and @xmath108 . the same expression for probability",
    "was described in  @xcite , but it was obtained other way .",
    "transformation @xmath109 maps uniformly distributed in interval @xmath110 $ ] random number @xmath111 to random number with distribution  ( [ prob - norm ] ) .",
    "step 3 of the algorithm described in section  [ sec - alg ] essentially contains two routines .",
    "we must choose , first , the direction of the random walk and , second , the walk length .",
    "the direction of the walk is chosen uniformly in @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "because the motion is uniform in direction , we can increase the step , but only if particle is far away from the cluster ( in our simulations we choose that distance such that particle is more than five units away from the cluster , otherwise , its step is one unit of length ) .",
    "the length for the big step is chosen with the condition that the walk should not intersect any particles of the cluster .",
    "therefore , the distance to the cluster @xmath113 is evaluated , and the step length is taken as that distance .",
    "the reason for implementing variable step length is as follows .",
    "most of the time the particle is moving far away from the cluster , and choosing a step length of the order of the particle distance from the cluster accelerates simulations .",
    "to realize all the proposed improvements efficiently we must organize memory in a special manner .",
    "when the particle moves , we must know whether it collides with a cluster , and to check this , we must iterate over all particles .",
    "such an approach is rather unreasonable and we must therefore restrict the number of particles to test .",
    "this is easily done by dividing the space into square cells , each about twenty units of length .",
    "each cell saves information about particles that stuck in the region covered by it .",
    "we therefore need only check cells that are in the region of one step .",
    "this model also improves the process of seeking the size of free space for the big step . to find the distance from current position to the cluster precisely is a difficult task , but it suffices in most cases to know it with an accuracy estimated from below , the size of one cell .",
    "figure  [ field ] shows how this is done .",
    "cells are plotted in the picture as squares with bold lines .",
    "they are marked with numbers showing their distance from the particle location .",
    "for simplicity , cells with the same number are thought to be at the same distance from the particle .",
    "occupied cells are shaded . in this example",
    "the particle is allowed to jump with the step length @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the cell size , and @xmath22 the particle radius .",
    "the distance @xmath115 is the radius of the inscribed circle with a center somewhere in cell @xmath116 ( in the worst case , the center lies on the border of cell @xmath116 ) .",
    "this length should be reduced because cells save only particle centers and there could be a projection of a particle into another cell with a size of @xmath22 . to simplify the algorithm we seek the step length only using the free / occupied cells picture .",
    "the first step is to check whether there are other particles in the cell we are now in , then we should check cells marked with 1 , then marked with 2 ( not shown in picture ) , and so on until we find an occupied cell .    during dla growth ,",
    "the intervals between branches increase notably , and the time to traverse all cells while seeking an occupied one also increases . to reduce the influence of such a process",
    ", ball and brady  @xcite developed a hierarchical memory model , where one cell is divided into smaller subcells and so on .",
    "this approach seems rather memory consumptive : in growing a large cluster , it would become a bottleneck of an algorithm .",
    "the desired effect can be achieved in another way .",
    "because the cell size is much more bigger than the particle size , the distribution of free cells changes slowly , and process of seeking the maximum free space could be started not from the particle position but from the free line achieved in the previous search from this origin . to implement this",
    "we must save the value of free space around each cell .",
    "if this information is unknown , i.e. , it is the first time to seek the maximum step length from the current cell , we should traverse all cells from the beginning ; otherwise we start from the line previously saved and move to the center .",
    "the cell size is chosen as follows .",
    "it should not be very small : a small size results in high memory consumption and a rapid change of the distribution of free cells .",
    "on the other hand , its size restricts the precision of the length we find for the big step , i.e. , there is a region of cell size near the cluster where particles can move only with a small steps . to avoid this last constraint",
    ", we use second - layer information .",
    "like ball and brady , we divide the cells into smaller ones . to minimize memory consumption , we realize them as an 32 bit integer , where each bit shows whether the corresponding subcell is occupied .",
    "each big cell can therefore be divided into not more than 25 subcells .",
    "as mentioned above , the second - layer information is only used when the particle moves near the cluster , where the accuracy given by the first layer is insufficient .",
    "figure  [ field ] shows large cells ( bold borders ) and small cells . using the first layer we can find that only the space inside the dashed circle is free .",
    "the second layer gives a more precise result : the particle can jump up to the bold circle ."
