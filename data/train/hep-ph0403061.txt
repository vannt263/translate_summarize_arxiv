    "structure functions play a central role in the perturbative qcd",
    ". experimental measurements of the spin dependent and unpolarized structure functions of the nucleon allow verification of sum rules and determination of free parameters of the input parton distributions . from the other side ,",
    "theoretical analysis within perturbative methods investigates the available experimentally region of the variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the interesting very small @xmath4 region ( still unmeasurable ) as well . in this low @xmath4 region qcd",
    "predicts a strong growth of structure functions with decreasing @xmath4 - the longitudinal momentum fraction of a hadron carried by a parton .",
    "small @xmath4 behaviour of the singlet unpolarized structure functions , driven by gluons , is governed by bfkl @xcite or ccfm @xcite , @xcite equations which generate the steep @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) shape of @xmath8 @xcite . for the nonsinglet",
    "unpolarized @xmath0 the driving term at small @xmath4 is a nonperturbative contribution of the @xmath9 regge pole @xmath10 @xcite which dominates even over the @xmath11 effects .",
    "these double logarithmic terms control however the small @xmath4 behaviour of both nonsinglet and singlet spin dependent structure function @xmath12 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "knowledge about structure functions at very low @xmath4 is very important .",
    "the sum rules , which can be verified by experiments , concern moments of structure functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 and hence require knowledge of @xmath15 and @xmath16 over the entire region of @xmath17 .",
    "the lowest limit of @xmath4 in present experiments is about @xmath18 so in theoretical analysis one should extrapolate results to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "more important is however the extrapolation to @xmath21 , where structure functions grow strongly than the extrapolation to @xmath20 , where structure functions are equal to 0 .",
    "the limit @xmath21 which implies that the invariant energy @xmath22 of the inelastic lepton - hadron scattering becomes infinite ( @xmath23 ) will never be attained experimentally .",
    "so we will really never know `` what it happens '' with structure functions at @xmath21 .",
    "this situation is however not quite hopeless .",
    "one can combine the qcd perturbative analysis in the very interesting small @xmath4 region with experimental data without uncertainty from the region where @xmath21 .",
    "it could be achieved through dealing with truncated moments of the structure functions , where one takes an integral over @xmath24 instead over the whole region @xmath25 . in usually used method of solving evolution equations in qcd",
    "one takes mellin ( full ) transforms of these equations what gives possibility of analytical solutions .",
    "then after inverse mellin transform ( performed numerically ) one can obtain suitable solutions of original equations in @xmath4 space . in this way",
    "e.g. in a case of dglap approximation , the differentio - integral equations for parton distributions @xmath26 after mellin transform change into simple differential and diagonalized ones in moment space @xmath27 .",
    "the only problem is knowledge of input parametrizations for the whole region @xmath25 what is necessary in the determination of moments of distribution functions .",
    "using truncated moments approach one can avoid uncertainty from the unmeasurable @xmath21 region and also obtain important theoretical results incorporating perturbative qcd effects at small @xmath4 , which could be verified experimentally .",
    "truncated moments of parton distributions in solving dglap equations have been presented in @xcite .",
    "authors have shown that the evolution equations for truncated moments though not diagonal can be solved with good precision .",
    "this is because each @xmath27-th truncated moment couples only with @xmath28 -th ( @xmath29 ) truncated moments . in our paper",
    "we adopt the truncated moments method to double logarithmic @xmath2 resummation . however a technique we use in this approach is quite different because suitable integral equations which correspond to @xmath2 terms are of course different from the dglap ones . as a result",
    "we obtain the equations for truncated moments of the unintegrated structure function @xmath3 , where each @xmath27-th moment ( @xmath30 ) couples only with itself and with @xmath31-th moment . for fixed coupling constant @xmath32 the result for @xmath27-th truncated moment can be found analytically .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to start the truncated moments method in the case of perturbative qcd formalism , describing double logarithmic @xmath2 terms in the nonsinglet structure functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the next section we recall the approach which resums the double logarithmic terms .",
    "the integral equation for the nonsinglet unintegrated quark distributions @xmath3 is presented . in point 3 the equation for truncated moments of @xmath3 within @xmath2 approach is derived .",
    "this equation is solved analytically for fixed @xmath32 .",
    "agreement for the limit case @xmath35 ( full moments ) of our results is shown .",
    "results for truncated moments of @xmath33 and @xmath34 for simple regge - type input parametrizations and different @xmath36 are presented in section 4 .",
    "we calculate also the contribution to the bjorken sum rule coming from the region of very small @xmath4 .",
    "finally in section 5 we summarize our results and discuss further possible improvement of our treatment .",
    "it has been noticed @xcite , @xcite that the nonsinglet structure functions of the nucleon in the small @xmath4 region are governed by double logarithmic terms i.e. powers of @xmath11 at each order of the perturbative expansion .",
    "this contribution to the @xmath2 resummation comes from the ladder diagram with quark and gluon exchanges along the chain - cf .",

    "terms in the nonsinglet spin structure functions.,width=264 ]    in contrast to the singlet spin dependent structure function , for the nonsinglet one the `` bremsstrahlung '' nonladder corrections vanish for the unpolarized structure function and are negligible for the spin dependent one @xcite , @xcite . in this way",
    "we do not need to take into account the nonladder diagrams in the case of nonsinglet ( both polarized and unpolarized ) structure functions .",
    "the regge theory @xcite , which concerns the regge limit : @xmath21 predicts singular behaviour of nonsinglet , unpolarized distributions and nonsingular ( flat ) shape of nonsinglet polarized ones : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes nonsinglet unpolarized and @xmath40 nonsinglet polarized quark distributions .",
    "the nonsinglet part of the unpolarized structure function has the form : @xmath41 where @xmath42\\ ] ] the spin dependent structure function is : @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath27 in above formulae denote proton and neutron respectively , @xmath46 is a charge of the @xmath47-flavour quark .",
    "hence finally we get : @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 are respectively spin and nonspin valence quark distributions in the proton . in the double logarithmic approximation",
    "the unintegrated nonsinglet quark distribution function @xmath54 satisfies the following integral equation @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a nonperturbative contribution which has a form : @xmath58 for nonspin distributions or @xmath59 for spin dependent distributions .",
    "the driving terms of these nonperturbative contributions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are shown in ( [ r2.1 ] ) and ( [ r2.2 ] ) .",
    "the unintegrated distribution @xmath54 is related to the quark distributions @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) via : @xmath60 in the unpolarized case and @xmath61 in the polarized one . using a method of the mellin moment functions one can obtain from ( [ r2.9 ] ) the following equation : @xmath62\\ ] ] where the full mellin moment of a function @xmath63 is defined as : @xmath64 and in our case : @xmath65 as it was shown in @xcite , equation ( [ r2.15 ] ) for fixed coupling @xmath66 can be solved analytically . because we would like later to compare full - moments approach with the truncated moments one , let us recall the way to obtain the analytical solution of ( [ r2.15 ] ) . a short explanation of this is given in appendix a.",
    "thus we get the solution of ( [ r2.15 ] ) in the form : @xmath67 where @xmath68\\ ] ] and @xmath69 the inhomogeneous term @xmath70 in ( [ r2.15 ] ) and ( [ r2.18 ] ) according to ( [ r2.16 ] ) , ( [ r2.11])-([r2.12 ] ) and ( [ r2.1])-([r2.2 ] ) behaves as : @xmath71 for unpolarized structure functions and @xmath72 for the spin dependent ones",
    ". the anomalous dimension of the moment of the nonsinglet structure function @xmath73 from ( [ r2.19 ] ) has a ( square root ) branch point singularity at @xmath74 .",
    "this gives the following behaviour of the nonsinglet structure functions at small @xmath4 : @xmath75 and hence also @xmath76 this low @xmath4 shape @xmath77 , where @xmath78 given in ( [ r2.20 ] ) is equal to 0.39 for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , remains nonleading in the case of the nonsinglet unpolarized structure function in comparison to the contribution of the nonperturbative @xmath9 regge pole ( [ r2.1 ] ) . in this way",
    "qcd perturbative singularity at small @xmath4 generated by the double logarithmic @xmath2 resummation for nonsinglet unpolarized quark distributions is hidden behind the leading regge contribution : @xmath81 quite different situation occurs for the nonsinglet spin dependent functions , where the double logarithmic contribution becomes important : @xmath82 this takes place because the nonperturbative regge part for spin dependent quark distributions involves a very low intercept @xmath83 .",
    "small @xmath4 behaviour @xmath84 of the nonsinglet structure functions originating from double logarithmic @xmath2 resummation is a very interesting feature . particularly for the polarized structure functions , where the double logarithmic analysis enable estimation of parton parametrizations at low @xmath4 . in the next section",
    "we introduce the truncated moments method and combine it with the @xmath2 approach . this technique will give a novel advantage in the qcd perturbative analysis : enable to avoid dealing with the unmeasurable @xmath21 region .",
    "the truncated @xmath27-th moment of the unintegrated nonsinglet function @xmath54 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ r3.9])-([r3.11 ] ) . in figs.2 - 3",
    "we plot the moments of @xmath54 for different @xmath27 as a function of @xmath36 at @xmath106 .",
    "one can see that the ratio @xmath107 defined as @xmath108 becomes very large ( @xmath109 ) at @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "this could be an advice that the truncated moments method is useful in the region @xmath112 because at lower @xmath4 the results for the full and the truncated moments are practically the same ( at least for the regge input ) . from the other",
    "side double logarithmic @xmath2 terms from our approach become important in the small @xmath4 region @xmath113 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so taking into account both above facts one should choose the limit point @xmath36 in the truncated moments of @xmath114 , @xmath34 or @xmath33 as @xmath115     as a function of @xmath36 for different @xmath27 at @xmath106 in @xmath2 approach.,width=264 ]    , similarly as in fig.2 but in a linear scale.,width=264 ]    truncated moments of the nonsinglet quark distributions are related to the moments of @xmath114 via : @xmath116 for the spin dependent structure function and via : @xmath117 for the unpolarized case .",
    "this together with ( [ r3.9])-([r3.11 ] ) gives the following formulae : @xmath118 \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath119 \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 in table i we collect results for different @xmath27-th moments of @xmath121 and @xmath122 functions obtained from ( [ r4.5])-([r4.6 ] ) .",

    "the small @xmath4 behaviour of structure functions is driven by the double logarithmic @xmath2 terms .",
    "this @xmath2 approximation is however inaccurate in describing the @xmath5 evolution for large values of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore double logarithmic @xmath2 approach should be completed by lo dglap @xmath5 evolution . dealing with truncated moments of @xmath114 within unified",
    "@xmath137lo resummation one encounters difficulties because suitable evolution equations are of course more complicated than in the pure double logarithmic approach here presented . probably the only successful method to solve the evolution equations for truncated moments in @xmath137lo treatment",
    "is the numerical calculus .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in the forthcoming paper .",
    "now we are able to employ the truncated moment method in calculation of the contribution to moment integrals coming from the region of very small @xmath4 . using the definition of the truncated moment ( [ r3.1 ] ) we can in a very easy way find the double truncated moments of @xmath114 , @xmath34 or @xmath33 : @xmath138 etc . in this way for the partial bjorken sum rule , according to ( [ r4.5 ] ) , we have : @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are both very small : @xmath142 we have thus estimated a contribution : @xmath143 and found that @xmath144 , @xmath145 what is equal to around @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively of the value of the full sum ( [ r4.13 ] ) . in our above estimation we have assumed the simple regge input parametrization of @xmath148 ( [ r4.11 ] ) .",

    "analytical results at fixed @xmath32 for truncated moments of @xmath33 and @xmath34 have been presented .",
    "we have received the clear , new solutions and what is important , in the limit @xmath35 our calculations confirm the well known analytical result for full moments of @xmath3 .",
    "the resummation of @xmath2 terms at small @xmath4 goes beyond the standard lo ( and even nlo ) qcd evolution of spin dependent parton densities . in the case of unpolarized structure functions ,",
    "the regge behaviour , originating from the nonperturbative contribution is the leading one at small @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the double logarithmic approximation is very important particularly for the polarized structure function @xmath15 , which at low @xmath4 is dominated just by @xmath2 terms . in our paper",
    "we have obtained analytical solutions for truncated mellin moments of @xmath34 ( and @xmath33 too ) . dealing with truncated moments at @xmath36",
    ": @xmath149 one can avoid uncertainty from the unmeasurable very small @xmath21 region . in this way the theoretical predictions of qcd analysis for structure functions at small @xmath4 can be compared with experimental data without necessity to extrapolate results into nonavailable @xmath150 range . in our analysis for nonsinglet structure functions @xmath34 and @xmath33 we have found their truncated at @xmath36 moments , what could be helpful in the estimation of bjorken ( @xmath34 ) and gottfried ( @xmath33 ) sum rules .",
    "we have estimated the contribution to the bjorken sum rule from the very small @xmath4 region ( @xmath151 ) and found it to be around @xmath146 of the value of the sum .",
    "evolution equations , we have derived for truncated mellin moments of @xmath3 generate correctly the leading small @xmath4 behaviour but do not describe @xmath5 evolution at large values of @xmath4 . in the integrals for moments of structure functions one need to have values of @xmath15 or @xmath16 from the entire range of @xmath4 : @xmath24 so for large @xmath4 one should include in the formalism lo altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution .",
    "the aim of our paper was to focus attention on the truncated moments technique within @xmath2 approach itself .",
    "we found an analytical solution for the truncated moments of structure functions within @xmath2 approximation .",
    "this is an important stage before further investigations .",
    "the next step in the improvement of our analysis will be including lo dglap evolution into equations generating double logarithmic terms @xmath2 for truncated moments of the nonsinglet structure functions .",
    "this should give a proper determination of truncated and thus experimentally verifiable sum rules .",
