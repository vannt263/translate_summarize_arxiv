    "= 7.0 cm    this question naturally rises in a variety of fields .",

    "perhaps , one of the simplest examples is provided by the underlying stochastic process @xmath3 being an ordinary brownian motion @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean @xmath10 , and a delta correlator @xmath11 . in this case , the probabiliy density @xmath0 is independent of @xmath12 and is well known  @xcite @xmath13 this curve is _ symmetric _ around the mid - point @xmath14 , has a ` @xmath15 shape ' with minimum at @xmath14 , and diverges at the two end points @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the cumulative distribution @xmath18 $ ] is known as one of levy s celebrated ` arcsine laws '  @xcite .    for a brownian bridge , i.e. , a brownian motion constrained to return to @xmath19 at @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath20",
    ", the corresponding pdf is known to be uniform : @xmath21 for @xmath22  @xcite .    motivated principally by the applications in the queueing theory and finance ,",
    "the pdf @xmath0 has been computed explicitly for a variety of other ` constrained ' brownian motions by using suitably adapted path integral methods .",

    "@xcite , the authors computed @xmath0 also for bessel processes and for continuous - time random walks .",
    "curiously , the pdf @xmath0 also appeared recently as an important input in the calculation of the area enclosed by the convex hull of a planar brownian motion of duration @xmath6  @xcite , which displays an interesting application in ecology .",
    "in addition , we have recently shown that @xmath0 also appears in the computation of the disorder - averaged equilibrium distribution of a particle moving in a random self - affine potential  @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath0 mentioned above have been obtained for brownian motion and its variants , which are all markov processes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to go beyond markov processes and present an exact result of @xmath0 for a non - markov process .",
    "the non - markov process that we study here is the well - known random acceleration process , which evolves via @xmath23 @xmath9 being a gaussian white noise with @xmath24 , as before , and @xmath25 . for simplicity",

    "the process starts at @xmath4 with @xmath27 , and evolves until the time @xmath6 .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 and @xmath29 the final position and velocity of the process , respectively ( see fig .",
    "the random acceleration process in the single variable @xmath3 is non - markovian , whereas the position - velocity process @xmath30 is markovian and does not depend on the past history .    the random acceleration process ,",
    "being among the simplest non - markovian processes , has been intensely studied both in physics and mathematics literature . in physics , for instance , it appears in the continuum description of the equilibrium boltzmann weight of a semiflexible polymer chain with non - zero bending energy  @xcite .",
    "it also describes the steady state profile of a @xmath31-dimensional gaussian interface  @xcite with dynamical exponent @xmath32 , the continuum version of the golubovic - bruinsma - das sarma - tamborenea model  @xcite .",
    "this process also appears in the description of the statistical properties of the burgers equation with brownian initial velocity  @xcite .",
    "the first - passage and a variety of other related properties of the random acceleration model are highly nontrivial and have been studied extensively over the last few decades  @xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to being relevant in many applications , the random acceleration model represents a simple , yet nontrivial , non - markov process where one can try to compute observables of physical interest .",
    "recent studies have concerned the distribution of extreme observables associated with this process , notably the global maximum @xmath5 itself over the interval @xmath2 $ ]  @xcite . in this paper , we focus instead on the time @xmath1 at which the global maximum @xmath5 occurs in @xmath2 $ ] . actually , we show in this paper that @xmath0 can be computed explicitly .",

    "it is also useful to consider the cumulative distribution @xmath42 , which reads @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the incomplete beta function  @xcite . a plot of @xmath45 is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where it is also compared to direct numerical solutions , to an excellent agreement .",
    "when @xmath46 is arbitrary , the process can be interpreted as the integral of a free brownian motion . in this case , we obtain the following exact result for the normalized pdf @xmath47 where the constant @xmath48 has the exact value @xmath49 the density is thus _ asymmetric _ around the mid - point @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) , and the maximum may either occur at some time _ strictly",

    ". 2 . in other words , roughly @xmath54 of all trajectories , starting at @xmath4 and @xmath55 , achieve their maximum only at the end of the interval @xmath2 $ ] .",

    "a plot of @xmath45 is provided in fig . 5 , where it is also compared to direct simulation results : we find an excellent agreement between analytical and numerical results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we outline the main ideas used for the exact derivation of @xmath0 via path decomposition techniques . in subsection 2.3",
    ", we also compare our analytical predictions with the results obtained via monte carlo simulations .",
    "a concluding section 3 presents a summary and raises some open questions .",
    "the details of the calculations are left to four appendices , as they involve rather cumbersome multiple integrations of airy functions .",
    "the basic ingredient in our computation is the propagator @xmath61 , i.e. , the probability that the process @xmath3 , starting at @xmath62 with velocity @xmath63 , reaches the point @xmath64 with velocity @xmath65 at time @xmath7 , without ever crossing the origin @xmath66 during this time .",
    "the laplace transform of the propagator has been explicitly computed by burkhardt and is recalled in  [ a : propagator ] .",
    "we show that the location of the maximum can be expressed in terms of the propagator @xmath67 .",
    "then , we make use of the known results about @xmath67 in laplace space to derive a closed form expression for @xmath0 .",
    "the velocity @xmath68 of a random acceleration process is a brownian motion , thus @xmath68 is continuous everywhere , which implies that @xmath3 is continuous and differentiable everywhere .",
    "an important consequence is that the global maximum @xmath5 can lie either inside the interval @xmath69 , with a velocity @xmath70 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , or at the boundary @xmath17 , with a velocity @xmath71 ( fig .",
