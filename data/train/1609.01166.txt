    "one of the beautiful and astonishing properties of the theory of toric varieties is the powerful dictionary translating algebraic geometry properties into combinatorial properties in terms of lattices , cones and polytopes , and vice versa .",
    "it is hence tempting to extend this powerful machinery to a larger class of varieties by studying flat toric degenerations of a given variety .",
    "several recent developments have enhanced the interest in flat toric degenerations .",
    "one feature has been the evolution of the theory of newton - okounkov bodies @xcite and its applications in algebraic and in symplectic geometry , see , for example @xcite .",
    "the theory of newton - okounkov bodies attaches a monoid @xmath1 and a convex body @xmath2 to a polarized ( smooth ) complex projective variety @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 is finitely generated , then anderson @xcite , harada and kaveh @xcite show that there exists an integrable system @xmath5 on @xmath6 such that the associated momentum map @xmath7 has @xmath2 as image , and there exists a flat degeneration of @xmath6 into a projective toric variety @xmath8 for a complex torus @xmath9 having @xmath2 as associated momentum polytope .",
    "in addition , the integrable system generates a torus action on the inverse image under @xmath10 of the interior of the moment polytope , inducing a @xmath11-equivariant symplectomorphism between this open subset of @xmath6 and an open subset of @xmath8 .",
    "a second feature is the program of gross , hacking , keel and kontsevich @xcite concerning ( partially compactified ) cluster varieties ( like flag varieties , double bruhat cells etc . ) . for a given cluster variety @xmath12 ,",
    "let @xmath13 be its mirror dual and denote by @xmath14 its tropicalization .",
    "for every seed one gets an identification of @xmath14 with a lattice in some @xmath15 .",
    "this allows them to generalize basic polyhedral constructions from toric geometry in a straight - forward way . in this",
    "setting , a polytope @xmath16 ( in the generalized sense ) corresponds to a compactification @xmath17 of @xmath12 . for any seed @xmath18 one",
    "gets an identification of the polytope @xmath16 with a polytope @xmath19 and a flat degeneration of the compactification @xmath17 to an ordinary polarized projective toric variety with @xmath20 as associated polytope . in the program proposed by gross , hacking ,",
    "keel and kontsevich , there are still many open questions left . for example , in the case of flag varieties it is not clear yet whether the assumptions necessary for the program to work are fulfilled .",
    "only recently magee @xcite announced a proof of several conjectures on the cluster structure of @xmath21 .",
    "gross , hacking , keel and kontsevich conjecture @xcite that their approach specializes to a uniform construction of many degenerations of representation theoretic objects to toric varieties .",
    "the results of rietsch and williams @xcite suggest that for flag varieties the two features : newton - okounkov theory and the cluster approach , are connected .    to determine explicitly the newton - okounkov body is in general a very difficult task .",
    "but to use the body to get , for example , estimates for the gromov width , the seshadri constant , for symplectic packings @xcite , to determine potential functions @xcite etc .",
    ", often a precise knowledge of the body is necessary . from this point of view",
    "the flag variety case can be seen as a perfect toy model for the theory . since it is endowed with a wealth of additional structure ( combinatorics of root systems and weyl groups , representation theory , enveloping algebra , etc . )",
    ", these extra features make it often possible to give an alternative construction of the monoid @xmath1 and to give a precise description of the convex body @xmath2 . for this reason we will stick in this overview to the case of flag varieties and make sometimes remarks about spherical varieties . for other connections of newton - okounkov bodies to representation theory",
    "see also the work of h. seppnen , for example in @xcite",
    ".    we will not be able to discuss all degenerations of flag varieties which can be found in the literature but just present a selection .",
    "for example , we will not be able to discuss the grbner degenerations of gramann varieties arising from tropical geometry .",
    "more details on this can be found in @xcite ; a relation to the approach by rietsch and williams in @xcite mentioned above can be found in @xcite .",
    "we explain now in more detail the content of the various sections .    in section  [ sec : grassmannian ] we will give a short introduction into the theory of hodge algebras , also called algebras with straightening laws .",
    "one of the first flat degenerations of a gramann variety into a union of toric varieties has been constructed by hodge @xcite .",
    "the ideas of hodge have been largely generalized by de concini , eisenbud and procesi in the framework of hodge algebras @xcite .    in section",
    "[ section : chiviri ] we consider an extended version of hodge algebras . for generalized flag varieties , results similar to those of de concini , eisenbud and procesi have been obtained by chiriv @xcite via upgrading the hodge algebra to the lakshmibai - seshadri ( ls ) algebra .    in section  [ gnachu ]",
    "we discuss the flat toric degenerations of flag varieties associated to string parametrizations .",
    "a flat toric degeneration of the flag variety with an irreducible special fiber has been given by gonciulea and lakshmibai @xcite in the case @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a borel subgroup , using standard monomial theory .",
    "this has been interpreted geometrically by kogan and miller @xcite using geometric invariant theory . a uniform construction for arbitrary reductive algebraic groups @xmath24 has been given by caldero @xcite .",
    "let @xmath24 be a reductive algebraic group @xmath24 and fix a maximal unipotent subgroup @xmath25 .",
    "for every choice of a reduced decomposition @xmath26 of the longest word @xmath27 in the weyl group of @xmath24 , caldero constructs a flat toric degeneration of the affine variety @xmath28 .",
    "the construction relies on the associated string parametrization and the multiplicative properties of the dual canonical bases .",
    "these results have been generalized to spherical varieties by alexeev and brion @xcite , see also the articles by kaveh and kiritchenko @xcite for another approach via the framework of newton - okounkov bodies @xcite .    in section  [ section : birational ]",
    "we describe a new approach to determine newton - okounkov bodies for flag varieties @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the idea is to replace @xmath29 by a birationally equivalent product of root subgroups .",
    "the latter leads then naturally to a coordinate system for the function field of @xmath29 and an associated lowest term valuation .",
    "so each such product decomposition gives rise to a valuation monoid @xmath30 .",
    "the ( up to birational equivalence ) decomposition of @xmath29 as a product of root subgroups induces also a filtration of the enveloping algebra @xmath31 and of the finite dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath24 .",
    "this can be used to attach a second monoid @xmath32 to the decomposition , the monoid of essential monomials .",
    "it turns out that @xmath33 , thus giving a representation theoretic interpretation of the valuation monoid .",
    "once one knows that the monoid @xmath34 is finitely generated , the methods used by alexeev and brion @xcite apply also to this much more general situation . in particular , we can use the theory to describe degenerations of @xmath24-varieties and not only of flag varieties .",
    "the background of the filtration construction is a conjecture of vinberg , which leads to a new class of toric degenerations with irreducible special fibers , see @xcite for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , see also @xcite for @xmath24 of type @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this construction uses monomial bases obtained through a refinement of the pbw - filtration of the corresponding universal enveloping algebra @xcite .    in section  [ examplesectionasm ]",
    "we discuss several examples .",
    "in particular , we show that the combination of the approach via newton - okounkov bodies and the approach via filtrations provides a general framework to study toric degenerations of generalized flag varieties and spherical varieties : we recover the degenerations of flag varieties associated to string parametrizations ( section [ sec : string ] ) as well as the toric degenerations induced by a pbw - filtration ( section  [ goodordering ] ) , and provide new examples arising from lusztig parametrizations ( section  [ lusztig ] ) of the canonical basis .",

    "smallrank ] we discuss some small rank examples .    in section  [ cluster ]",
    "we give a very rough sketch on relations between the theory of cluster varieties and toric degenerations @xcite .",

    "we conjecture that the essential monoid is always finitely generated , independently of the choice of the birational sequence and the choice of the ordering .    for applications it might be useful to have available all possible choices of birational sequences and weighted orders .",

    "instead of studying toric degenerations , one may also look at intermediate steps , as , for example , the pbw - degenerate flag variety in @xcite .",
    "a related class of degenerations are the linear degenerations of flag varieties studied in @xcite , which are degenerations of the flag variety as a quiver gramannian . in connection with the cluster variety approach it is natural to ask whether it is possible to identify these degenerations as a fiber of the flat morphism constructed by gross , hacking , keel and kontsevich ( see and theorem  [ ghkkfibration ] ) .",
