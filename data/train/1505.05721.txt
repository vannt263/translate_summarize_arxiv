    "the reason to exclude the longest - wavelength irac bands in this step is that , for low-@xmath24 sources , dust emission ( including that from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) can significantly contribute to the photometry beyond @xmath71 , so the sed fitting with pure stellar templates may not be adequate . as a priori we did not know the redshifts of our sources",

    "( 2011 ) : for sources detected in the @xmath73 band ( with @xmath74 significance ) , the maximum accepted redshift was @xmath75 . for sources significantly detected in @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ,",
    "the maximum imposed redshifts were 4.6 , 5.6 , and 6.4 , respectively .",
    "we note that , in practice , these maximum redshift constraints had to be applied for a small amount of sources ( @xmath79 of the sample ) , as our code directly produced best - fit redshifts consistent with the short - wavelength photometric detections in the vast majority of cases .    for all the @xmath80 galaxy candidates obtained in the sed modelling run ( a total of 252 sources )",
    ", we performed a second sed modelling considering the 30 photometric bands ( i.e. , with the full irac photometry ) .",

    "we analysed the sed fitting results for these sources considering the results of the 30-band sed modelling , and also the full @xmath62 map in all cases , in order to investigate degeneracies in @xmath86 space .    to accept a @xmath80 galaxy candidate",
    ", we imposed the criterion that the best - fit solution should be @xmath80 both in the 28- and the 30-band sed fitting , when both were available . for the @xmath87 candidates , we also requested two additional conditions , namely : i )",
    "no secondary @xmath62 local minimum should exist at @xmath88 within @xmath89 of the best - fit solution at @xmath90 ( i.e. , reduced @xmath62 ( secondary @xmath69 ) - @xmath62 ( primary @xmath69 ) @xmath91 ) ; ii ) the median of the marginalized @xmath92 versus @xmath24 distribution should also be at @xmath87 .",
    "the latter is especially helpful in cases of broad @xmath92 distributions , where no secondary @xmath62 local minimum is identified within @xmath89 , but @xmath92 significantly extends to lower @xmath24 .",
    "these are conservative criteria that ensure that we keep only reliable high-@xmath24 sources in our sample .",
    "overall , we found that 188 out of 252 @xmath80 candidates satisfy all these criteria .",
    "for the remaining candidates , we replaced the best - fitting solutions by the 30-band best solutions , when available , the secondary lower @xmath69 within @xmath93 confidence , or the lower median @xmath69 values , with corresponding best - fit parameters .    in the analysis of the @xmath80 galaxy candidates with full irac photometry",
    ", we searched for galaxies with a plausible ir power - law sed component , following the power - law subtraction methodology explained in caputi  ( 2013 ) .",
    "such power - law sed component is a clear indication of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at such high @xmath24 , but only the warmest sources at @xmath58 can be identified using data up to @xmath94 ( the maximum contribution of the agn - associated ir power law occurs at rest wavelengths @xmath95 , and thus this maximum is shifted beyond observed @xmath96 at @xmath80 ; see discussion in caputi  2013 , 2014 ) .",
    "nevertheless , our aim here is not to make a complete agn census among our galaxies , but rather to identify cases where the @xmath69 and stellar masses could be affected by a non - stellar component in the sed .",

    "only three display a mid - ir excess that suggests an agn presence ( and one of these has a revised redshift @xmath97 ) .",

    "our values at @xmath121 have been obtained by integrating the schechter function after correction for eddington bias , with the parameter values given in table  [ tab - schech35 ] , so they can be considered total values , and we also show the values obtained by integrating the gsmf only above the stellar - mass completeness limits . at @xmath285 , instead , we do not probe a wide enough stellar mass range to attempt a good schechter function determination , so we only sum up the individual contributions of our galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - gsmfz57 ] ) .",
    "therefore , at these high redshifts , our sample provides only a lower limit of the cosmic stellar mass density .",
    "as the stellar mass regime that we probe at @xmath285 is complementary to that probed by candels , we can can estimate the _ total _ stellar mass density estimates at these redshifts by summing up the contributions obtained here and the average of the candels determinations @xcite . in this case",
    ", we only considered the galaxies in our sample above our stellar - mas completeness limit ( imposed by the irac completeness ) and the candels results at lower stellar masses .",
    "the resulting total stellar mass density estimate is indicated with a large open circle in figure  [ fig - stmdvsz ] .",

    "( 2011 ) and santini et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , even within the errors .",
    "these two studies have been based on very small areas of the sky , so cosmic variance is the most likely reason for this discrepancy . on the other hand , at @xmath298 ,",
    "our new stellar mass density determination is significantly above the value obtained by caputi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . in this case",
    ", this is mainly due to the incompleteness in the near - ir identification of high-@xmath24 irac sources ( caputi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) used the uds data release 5 ) .",

    "in this paper we have studied a sample of 574 _ spitzer _ irac bright ( @xmath1<23 $ ] ) , near - ir faint ( @xmath2 ) galaxies over @xmath1190.8  deg@xmath289 of the ultravista ultra - deep cosmos field .",
    "this is the first time that the study of such galaxies can be conducted over a large area of the sky , and it is becoming possible thanks to the unique combination of area and depth that is being achieved by the ultravista survey .",
    "our galaxy sample constitutes a small ( @xmath300 ) fraction of the overall @xmath1<23 $ ] galaxy population .",

    ". however , the difference appears to be less dramatic than previously found , after correcting for the effect of eddington bias .",
    "our results indicate that some very massive galaxies are present since the universe was only a billion years old . in the @xmath303 of elapsed time between redshifts @xmath276 and 3.5 ,",
    "the gsmf highest - mass end had a non - negligible evolution .",
    "quantitatively , the number density of @xmath304 galaxies rose by a factor of about four between these redshifts .",
    "the number density at @xmath277 increased by another factor of ten later by @xmath305 , in the two billion years encompassing the star formation activity peak of the universe @xcite .",
    "finally , that number density increased by another factor of about four until reaching the present value .",
    "so , in conclusion , the most massive galaxies were formed quite effectively after the first billion years : almost as effectively as during the peak activity epoch , and much more effectively than over the past ten billion years of cosmic time .",
    "the presence of very massive ( @xmath10 $ \\sim$}}~}2 \\times 10^{11 } \\ , \\rm m_\\odot$ ] ) galaxies in our sample at @xmath271 , and virtual absence at @xmath306 , provide a strong constraint on the evolution of the gsmf highest - mass end , which suggests that the appearance of such massive galaxies took place in the few hundred million years of elapsed time between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this kind of constraint can not be obtained from small area surveys like candels @xcite , even when the datasets are deeper .",
    "hence , we conclude that _ wide - area galaxy surveys are necessary to sample this very massive galaxy population at high @xmath24_. the combination of area and depth of ultravista is currently unique for this purpose .",
    "the only alternative to this conclusion is that , among the @xmath1<23 $ ] galaxies that remain unidentified and/or those which have no redshift determination in our current sample , there is a population of very massive galaxies at @xmath222 that are significantly dust obscured .",
    "one possible candidate for such galaxies was discussed by caputi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in one of the candels fields , but the level of dust obscuration ( @xmath307  mag ) is atypical , given our current knowledge of galaxies in the early universe ( but see oesch et al .",
    "further studies in other fields , as well as future follow up with _ jwst _ and alma , are necessary to confirm whether such sources exist at @xmath222 .    in any case , a substantial fraction of the still unidentified irac @xmath1<23 $ ] sources are more likely dust - obscured massive galaxies ( @xmath10 $ \\sim$}}~}5 \\times 10^{10 } \\ , \\rm m_\\odot$ ] ) at @xmath308 .",
    "this is suggested by the colour - colour diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - colz ] and our gsmf determinations . further analysis of this problem after the ultravista completion , which will achieve near - ir photometry @xmath309 mag deeper than the current dr2 release , will help us elucidate whether we are still missing a significant amount of massive galaxies at high @xmath24 .",
