    "abundance ratios of the three stable isotopes of oxygen ( , , ) in meteorites and planetary samples are used to infer the existence of reservoirs and processes in the early solar system .",
    "each of these isotopes was produced in a different mass - distribution of stars , and the isotopic composition of the solar system is the cumulative result of @xmath09 billion years ( gyr ) of previous galactic stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    ", a primary isotope , is principally formed during he - burning in massive stars , and added to the ism by core - collapse supernovae ( type ii sne ) .  and  are secondary isotopes : the first is produced by reaction of light nuclei during the cno cycle ; the second by nitrogen reactions during he burning . both of the heavier isotopes are ejected by type ii sne .  is also produced by the intermediate - mass progenitors of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . the yield scales with the abundance of  @xcite .",
    "thus , in a plot of /  vs. / , galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) is expected to proceed along a slope - one line @xcite .",
    "comparisons of the sun with gas and other objects in the milky way should reveal such a trend , with younger objects being relatively  poor .",
    "observations to date do not fulfil this expectation . measurements of primordial solar system materials , including the solar wind returned by _ genesis _",
    "spacecraft @xcite , fall along a slope - one line that has a high /  ( but not high ) compared to the much younger ism and newly - formed stars @xcite .",
    "one proposed explanation is that the solar system formed from molecular gas polluted by -rich gas from massive stars @xcite .",
    "slrs such as 26 , 41 and 60 in the early solar system are interpreted as evidence that contamination did occur @xcite .",
    "however , the oxygen isotopic composition of the solar system falls along the same trend inferred for the initial compositions of agb stars that formed before the sun and produced the presolar oxide grains in primitive meteorites @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to explain the oxygen isotopic composition of the solar system , ( 1 ) the delivery of sn ejecta must have occurred before cessation of star formation in the cloud , ( 2 ) it must have been efficient enough to produce the observed offset , ( 3 ) it must be quantitatively consistent with the abundance of slrs , and ( 4 ) it must be compatible with the observed slope - one dispersion of primitive solar system materials and the solar wind in a three - isotope plot (  vs. ) , if this dispersion is primary ( see below ) .",
    "we argue that the sn pollution hypothesis fails all four tests .",
    "first , stellar nucleosynthesis calculations show that _ only _ b - star progenitors ( 8 - 15  ) have sn ejecta with /  ratios substantially higher than the current ism @xcite and are plausible sources of pollution . however , these stars have main - sequence lifetimes @xmath115  myr , longer than the typical duration of star formation in clouds @xcite , and thus low - mass stars forming from the same cloud are unlikely to be polluted .",
    "the probability of an unaffiliated b star polluting a given cloud during its lifetime is approximately @xmath2 , where @xmath3  myr@xmath4 is the type ii sn rate in the milky way @xcite ( mostly from b star progenitors ) , @xmath5 myr is the mean cloud lifetime @xcite , and @xmath6 is the volume filling factor of a 10  pc cloud in the galactic disk .",
    "the probability is @xmath00.2% , comparable to that of an encounter with an agb star @xcite .",
    "second , mixing between hot , tenuous sn ejecta and cooler , denser molecular gas is inefficient .",
    "a 3-dimensional simulation produced mixing of 50 ppm @xcite , only 2.5% of what is required .",
    "refractory grains of al@xmath7o@xmath8 can carry 26 into a cloud @xcite , but can accommodate only 0.9% of all oxygen @xcite .",
    "sn are predicted to be copious sources of dust , but no more than @xmath9-@xmath10  has been detected per event @xcite .",
    "the scarcity of -rich presolar grains of plausible sn origin @xcite also supports inefficient sn dust production and transfer to star - forming regions .",
    "third , slrs such as 26 , 41 , and 60 , with half - lifes of 0.72 , 0.1  myr , and 2.6  myr @xcite , respectively , accompanied sn ejecta and wolf - rayet winds from massive stars , and slr abundances and any oxygen isotopic shift should be related @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that introduction of exogenous slrs would likely have occurred during the giant molecular cloud phase @xcite .",
    "26 was homogeneously distributed in the protosolar nebula with the ratio 26/@xmath11al @xmath12 @xcite",
    ". the allowed fraction of sn ejecta depends on the interval of free decay of 26 between injection and the formation of refractory calcium - aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais , taken to represent time zero ) .",
    "the abundance of 41 constrains the interval of free decay to @xmath00.3  myr , and monte carlo calculations show that the solar system most likely formed from a cloud polluted to 0.3% by a generation of stars that formed 4.5 myr earlier @xcite . only progenitors more massive than 50  could pollute , but such stars are depleted in both  and  with respect to the solar system .",
    "limongi & chieffi ( 2003 ) predict that the ejecta from a 35  progenitor contains 5 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14  of , , and , respectively .",
    "[ see woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for similar figures .",

    "the high - temperature components ( chondrules and cais ) of unaltered chondritic meteorites plot along a slope - one line in a three - isotope oxygen diagram @xcite .",
    "the dispersion is usually explained by models in which ( 1 ) the initial oxygen isotopic compositions of both solids and gas were identical and equal to the solar wind value returned by _ genesis _ ; and ( 2 ) the slope - one line is a consequence of mixing with an -poor reservoir generated in the protoplanetary disk by `` self - shielding '' of co isotopomers from ultraviolet dissociation , e.g. lyons & young ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , these assumptions have been challenged by krot et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who concluded that ( 1 ) primordial ( thermally unprocessed ) solids in the solar system were already -depleted relative to solar nebula gas ; and ( 2 ) co self - shielding had only a small effect on the isotopic chemistry of dust in the solar system . in this scenario ,",
    "the slope - one line was produced by mixing of _ relict _ , isotopically distinct reservoirs , i.e. gas and dust of different ages @xcite .",
    "any contamination by -rich ejecta would have to be contrived such that the final slope - one line was preserved .",
    "the isotopic composition of the solar system can be explained in terms of gce that has deviated from the canonical slope - one line at least since the sun formed 4.6 gyr ago .",
    "a flat age - metallicity relation @xcite and the deficit of metal - poor stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite indicate that the metallicity of star - forming gas has evolved little over the past @xmath010  gyr , presumably because of the infall of metal - poor gas and the sequestration of metals in low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "this means that the recent evolution of the /  and /  ratios in the milky way depended not on , but on the relative contributions by stars of different masses to each isotope , and the time - variation caused by the strong dependence of main sequence lifetime on stellar mass .",
    "the ism is neither a closed system nor chemically and isotopically homogeneous .",
    "gas and dust move through different phases ( molecular clouds , neutral ism , hii regions ) , and stars with different masses add or remove isotopes at different times depending on their main sequence life .",
    "a gce model should include : ( 1 ) infall of metal - poor , -rich gas ; ( 2 ) massive progenitors of sn ( and wolf - rayet stars ) which begin ejecting mass 1 - 3  myr after the formation of their progenitors @xcite and can pollute their natal molecular cloud @xcite ; ( 3 ) stars with initial masses of 1.5 - 8  which move onto the red giant and asymptotic branches @xmath170  myr after their formation , long after dispersal of the molecular cloud , eject mass into low - density ism phases , and preferentially enrich them in  with respect to star - forming regions ; and ( 4 ) stars with @xmath151  which remain on the main sequence for @xmath112  gyr and are a sink for all isotopes .",
    "the sequestration of relatively -rich gas from star - forming regions will leave the ism enriched in .",
    "we propose that the cumulative effect is gce with a stagnant /  ratio but a decreasing /  ratio , and that the difference between the sun ( and all stars of its age ) and gas in the present milky way is a result of this gradual change .",
    "we calculated the evolution of the oxygen isotopic composition in the vicinity of the sun s formation and present location using a two - box model of gce .",
    "one box represents the low - density phases of the ism ( hereafter referred to as the ism ) , which receives metal - poor infalling gas , gas ejected from star - forming regions , winds from agb stars , and some sn ejecta .",
    "the second box represents star - forming regions ( molecular clouds ) .",
    "it receives gas from the ism , returning ( most of ) it after disruption of the clouds , and the difference is incorporated into stars .",
    "three types of stars are considered : low - mass stars ( @xmath16 ) which only sequester mass ; intermediate - mass progenitors of agb stars , and high - mass ( @xmath17  ) sn progenitors .",
    "sne eject mass into either molecular clouds or the ism , depending on their main - sequence life relative to the cloud lifetime ( 10  myr ) ; agb stars pollute only the ism .",
    "the mass flux from the ism into molecular clouds is calculated using a fixed ism residence time of 280  myr , a value calculated from a total gas surface density of 14  pc@xmath18 in the present solar neighborhood @xcite , a star formation efficiency of 10% @xcite , and a local star - formation rate of @xmath19  pc@xmath18  myr@xmath4 .",
    "this last value is based on a sn rate of 0.04  yr@xmath4 @xcite and the abundance of 26 in the milky way @xcite .",
    "this residence time is consistent with previous estimates @xcite and the interstellar residence times of presolar grains @xcite .",
    "the return flow of gas through hii regions and the disruption of molecular clouds by sn assumes a cloud residence time of 10  myr @xcite .",
    "we relate star - formation rate to total gas density by a schmidt - kennicut law with an index of 1.45 @xcite . we adopt a power - law stellar initial mass function with index of 2.35 for @xmath20  and take the fraction of stellar mass in lower - mass stars to be 0.42 .",
    "the present gas infall rate is poorly constrained by direct observations , but rates have been inferred from the distribution of stellar metallicities .",
    "we assume a constant rate based on a recent analysis of g- and k - star metallicities @xcite .",
    "moreover , the adopted relationship between star - formation and gas surface density , and the current _ total _ mass density in the solar neighborhood [ @xmath050  pc@xmath18 @xcite ] restrict the range of possible infall rates in our model . a rate of @xmath21  pc@xmath18  myr@xmath4 successfully reproduces the present surface densities of gas , stars , and stellar remnants [ 14 , 35 , and 3  pc@xmath18 , respectively @xcite ] .",
    "the infalling gas is assumed to contain 10% solar  and no   or .",
    "nucleosynthetic yields are taken from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for sn and from boothroyd & sackmann ( 1999 ) for agb stars .",
    "we do not consider stars more massive than 40 , for which detailed yields have yet to be published .",
    "these stars are thought to contribute negligible  or .",
    "dependence on metallicity is determined by linear interpolations between solar and single sub - solar values .",
    "the  yield from massive stars might have to be adjusted significantly downwards because of revised values for the proton capture reaction rates ( p,@xmath22)@xmath23n and ( p,@xmath22)@xmath24f @xcite . removing the contribution from massive stars to",
    "altogether results in a model /  ratio in star - forming regions 4.6 gyr ago that is within 15% of the solar value . with unadjusted  yields ,",
    "the model predicts an /  ratio that is within 7% of the solar value .",
    "we are unable to simultaneously reproduce the surface densities of stars and gas , _ and _ the absolute oxygen abundance of star - forming clouds 4.6 gyr ago ( i.e. the solar abundance ) .",
    "one solution , besides tuning yields , is start the assembly of the disk at the sun s location only 10  gyr ago , i.e. 3.5  gyr after the formation of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "another is to allow a small fraction of the oxygen - enriched gas from star - forming regions to permanently escape the disk and be replaced with metal - poor gas .",
    "figure [ fig.evo ] shows the predicted evolution of the oxygen isotope ratios in both the ism ( diamonds ) and star - forming regions ( squares ) with respect to values in star - forming regions 4.6 gyr ago ( taken to represent the solar value ) .",
    "gce is towards a -poor , but relatively -rich condition : it does _ not _ follow a slope - one line . in our model ,",
    "the difference in /  between the ism and star - forming regions is due only in small part to contamination of clouds by sn , because only progenitors of 18 - 40  are sufficiently short - lived and these contribute little .",
    "instead , it is mostly due to contamination of the ism with  from agb stars over the @xmath0280  myr it takes for the two reservoirs to exchange .",
    "episodic gas infall or star formation produces yet more dramatic departures from a slope - one trajectory .",
    "cosmological models predict stochastic time variation associated with infalling dark matter halos @xcite , and accompanied by elevated rates of star formation .",
    "if the sun formed during a @xmath01  gyr episode of increased star formation ( twice the background rate ) , it partakes of an enhanced -rich contribution from massive stars ( figure [ fig.episodicsf ] ) before winds from agb stars return the ism to its previous isotopic trajectory . in a sense , this _ is _ sn pollution , but on a galactic scale .",
    "our model of gce in the solar neighborhood produces a super - unity slope in a three - oxygen isotope plot , and can explain the high /  ratio of the sun with respect to the ism .",
    "the absence of this phenomenon in previous models @xcite may be attributable to the assumption that stars form from a gas of mean disk composition , rather than one to which agb stars of the same generation have yet to contribute .",
    "our model also predicts a difference between the composition of the ism and star - forming regions : such a difference has not been observed @xcite but _ measurements of oxygen isotopes are currently possible only in molecular ( i.e. co - containing ) gas _ and the composition of the low - density phases of the ism is unknown .",
    "the composition of young stellar objects also appears to be dispersed along a slope - one line in a three oxygen isotope plot .",
    "this effect could be produced by heterogeneous mixing of galactic disk gas with infalling , metal - poor gas lacking  and  ( figures [ fig.evo ] and [ fig.episodicsf ] ) .    a purported galactocentric gradient in oxygen isotopes ( increasing  with radius ) @xcite is cited as support for standard gce : however , recent data do not exhibit a significant trend @xcite , and while the /  ratio at the galactic center may be higher than disk values , the former may have been previously overestimated @xcite . instead , wouterlout et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report an increasing /  ratio with galactocentric radius and a lower /  in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) compared to similarly metal - poor regions of the outer disk .",
    "they explain both of these observations as a result of the accumulation of  with time , i.e. both the inner disk and lmc are older than the outer disk .",
    "a corollary of this conclusion is that at any given galactocentric radius , younger objects ( e.g. , the ism and newly - formed stars ) will be more -rich than older ones ( e.g. , the solar system ) .",
    "our scenario predicts that most low mass stars of the sun s age should have a similar oxygen isotopic composition .",
    "the sn contamination scenario , in contrast predicts that the sun lies at the extreme of a distribution of /  ratios ( corresponding to different levels of contamination ) , something the observations so far do not suggest . while it is presently not possible to measure the oxygen isotopic composition of main - sequence stars , other isotopes such as those of mg @xcite or si @xcite might serve as proxies .",
    "the /  ratio of the solar system ( 89@xmath251 ) @xcite is higher than the interstellar ratio in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "this difference can be explained by the high /  ratio in winds from red giant branch and agb stars @xcite , although chemical inhomogeneities in the ism may also be important @xcite .",
    "the present - day c and o isotopic composition of the ism at the galactocentric location of the sun s birth is consistent with mixing of average agb winds with the ism 4.6 gyr ago ( represented by the solar system ) ( figure [ fig.co ] ) .",
    "our arguments do not preclude _ any _ pollution of the sun s parent molecular cloud by massive stars , but demonstrate that the required amount and kind of pollution is neither plausible nor necessary to explain the /  ratio of the solar system .",
    "the solar system s initial inventory of 26 from the ejecta of @xmath27  stars would have been accompanied by a shift of about -65@xmath28 in both heavy isotopes .",
    "if this - and -depleted oxygen was delivered primarily as gas to the natal molecular cloud , it would have established an offset between the isotopic compositions of gas and dust in the cloud along the slope - one line .",
    "this , as well as mixing with infalling metal - poor gas , could explain the slope - one dispersion in primitive meteorite components and the solar wind @xcite .",
