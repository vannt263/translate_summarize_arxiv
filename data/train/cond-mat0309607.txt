    "the concept of stochastic resonance ( sr ) has been originally put forward in order to explain the periodicity of glacial recurrences on the earth @xcite .",
    "it has gained , however , an immense popularity in the context of signal transduction in nonlinear stochastic systems in physics and biology @xcite . paradoxically enough , the detection of beneficial input signals in the background stochastic fluctuations of a signal - transmitting physical system can be improved upon corrupting the information - carrying signal with input noise , or upon raising the level of intrinsic thermal noise .",
    "a first example of sr has been given for a continuous state bistable dynamics agitated by the thermal noise and periodically modulated by an external signal @xcite .",

    "sr has been first demonstrated experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the mesoscopic system in @xcite consists of dynamically self - assembled alamethicin ion channels of variable size that are placed in a lipid membrane . up to this date",
    ", however , there remains the challenge to demonstrate sr on the level of _ single _ stable molecules .",
    "ion channels of biological membranes @xcite present one of the most appealing objects for such _ single - molecular _ studies .",
    "the invention of patch clamp technique by neher and sakmann in 1976 @xcite made such investigations possible .",
    "the single - molecular sr experiments which have been performed under the conditions of variable _ intrinsic _ thermal noise intensity @xcite , did not arrive at the convincing conclusions . a recent _ theoretical _ study @xcite suggested a parameter regime where sr effect should indeed occur for a shaker @xmath0 channel under physiological conditions when _ external _ noise is added to the signal .",
    "this issue has further been examined theoretically in @xcite .",
    "the present status calls for both theoretical , and experimental further investigations . particularly , the presence of distinct memory effects in the dynamics of such single molecules as ion channels @xcite constitutes a major theoretical challenge .",
    "the non - markovian features caused by these memory effects may be crucial for the occurrence of stochastic resonance on the level of single molecules",
    ".    the gross features of the observed bistable dynamics can be captured by a two - state stochastic process @xmath1 that switches forth and back between two values @xmath2 and @xmath3 at random time points @xmath4 .",
    "such a two - state random process can be directly extracted from filtered experimental data and then statistically analyzed .",
    "basically , the process @xmath1 is characterized as follows : the sojourn in the state @xmath5 alternates randomly at @xmath6 into the sojourn in the state @xmath7 , then @xmath1 switches back to @xmath5 at time @xmath8 , and so on .",
    "if the sojourn time intervals @xmath9 are _ independently _ distributed ( a condition which we shall assume throughout the following ) , such two - state renewal processes are fully specified by two residence time distributions ( rtds ) @xmath10 @xcite . in the simplest case , which corresponds to the dichotomic markovian process ( dmp ) , both rtds are strictly exponential , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the transition rates which equal the inverse mean residence times ( mrts ) , which are given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",

    "the spectral amplification of signal , @xmath32 , exhibits the effect of sr , i.e. a bell - shaped dependence versus increasing intrinsic thermal noise strength which is measured by the temperature @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the above outlined two - state markovian theory has been put forward by mcnamara and wiesenfeld @xcite ; this approach has proven very useful over the years as a basic , prominent model for sr research @xcite .",
    "remarkably enough , this simple model allows one to unify the various kinds of sr  periodic , aperiodic @xcite , and even non - stationary sr  within a unifying framework of information theory @xcite .",
    "many _ observed _ bistable stochastic processes @xmath1 are , however , truly not markovian , as can be deduced from the experimentally observed rtds . as a matter of fact",
    ", any deviation of rtds from the strictly exponential form indicates a deviation from the markovian behavior @xcite .",
    "the profoundly non - markovian case emerges when at least one of the rtds possesses a large ( diverging ) variance @xmath33 .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of single molecules is especially interesting in this respect .",
    "for example , the rtds of the conductance fluctuations in biological ion channels are in many cases not exponential @xcite .",
    "usually , a sum of many exponentials , @xmath34 is needed to describe the experimental data @xcite . moreover , in some cases @xmath35 can well be described by a stretched exponential @xcite , or by a power law @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "@xcite such a power law behavior has been found for the closed time rtd of a large conductance ( bk ) potassium channel with a power law exponent @xmath37 yielding formally @xmath38 .",
    "this in turn implies that such conductance fluctuations should exhibit a characteristic @xmath39 noise power spectrum @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "what are the non - markovian features of sr in similar systems ?",

    "similar models with alternating renewal processes have been used previously in the sr theory for some particular stochastic dynamics contracted to the two - state dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the class of colored noise driven stochastic resonance @xcite is also intrinsically non - markovian .",
    "all these prior studies have been restricted , however , to situations with finite memory effects on a finite time scale .",
    "a truly non - markovian situation emerges when the memory effects extend practically to infinity , exhibiting a scale free , weak power law decay .",
    "a phenomenological linear response theory of such genuine non - markovian sr ( which does not presume a knowledge of the underlying microscopic dynamics ) has been put forward recently in ref .",
    "the present work provides further details and , additionally , presents a more general framework for the non - markovian sr theory which extends beyond the linear response description .",
    "to start , let us consider a two - state renewal process ( tsrp ) @xmath1 which takes initially , at time @xmath42 , the value @xmath5 , or the value @xmath7 with the probability @xmath43 , or @xmath44 , correspondingly . at a random time point",
    "@xmath45 the process switches its current state with the probability one into another state and stays there until some next random time point @xmath46 . then , the renewal process proceeds further in time in the same manner .",
    "the survival probability to remain in the state @xmath47 , or the state @xmath48 for the time @xmath9 is @xmath49 , or @xmath50 , correspondingly .",
    "these two survival probabilities completely specify the considered tsrp @xcite . the functions @xmath51 must satisfy the following obvious restrictions : ( i ) @xmath52 , ( ii ) @xmath53 ( non - increasing function of time ) ( iii ) @xmath54 ; ( iv ) @xmath55 , but are otherwise arbitrary .",

    "moreover , the power law dependence , @xmath59^{1+\\gamma}},\\;\\gamma>0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] corresponds to the pareto distribution .",
    "both weibull and pareto distributions typify the so - called fractal dependencies . in particular , such distributions have been detected for several different types of ion channels @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the pareto distribution is that for @xmath60 it displays a diverging variance , @xmath61 , whereas the mrt @xmath62 is finite .",
    "the closed time - intervals of a large conductance potassium ion channel studied in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to obey ( [ pareto ] ) with @xmath63 .",

    "if the whole hierarchy is produced by a more complicated scaling law involving two , or more independent fundamental rate constants , the distribution is multi - fractal .",
    "the corresponding stochastic processes can be referred to as fractal renewal processes @xcite .",
    "such random processes presently attract renewed attention in physics and in mathematical biology @xcite .    the negative time - derivative @xmath71 yields the corresponding residence time distributions @xcite .",
    "next , let us assume that a number of alternations occurred before the starting time point @xmath42 and the considered process became homogeneous in time _ before _",

    "nevertheless , we keep formally this distinction in the following , because when the driving is being switched off , the process @xmath1 relaxes to its stationary state .",
    "this distinction becomes very important in order to construct the evolution operator for time - homogeneous initial preparations .",
    "our immediate goal is to obtain the evolution equations for the considered stochastic process : we are looking for the forward evolution operator @xmath90 ( or the matrix of conditional probabilities ) connecting the probability vector @xmath91^t$ ] at two different instants of time @xmath92 and @xmath42 ; i.e. , @xmath93 this evolution operator can be explicitly constructed by considering the contributions of all possible stochastic paths leading from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",

    "( [ mainres ] ) reduces to the result ( [ ftfreq2 ] ) of the phenomenological theory of linear response developed previously in ref .",

    "we applied these general expressions to study the main features of stochastic resonance in several non - markovian systems exhibiting long - range temporal correlations along with @xmath39 power spectra of fluctuations .",
    "in particular , for a symmetric non - markovian system with a power law distributed residence time intervals the occurrence of stochastic resonance has been demonstrated to comply with a stochastic frequency synchronization similar to the markovian case @xcite .",
    "however , both the spa - measure and the snr - measure become strongly suppressed due to strong non - markovian effects .",
    "the most striking feature of the non - markovian sr is a distinct _ frequency dependence of the snr measure_. in particular , the snr becomes immensely suppressed for low frequency signals .",
    "thus , the use of signals with an intermediate frequency range matching the mean time of the stochastic escapes between states yields most distinct non - markovian sr - feature .    for asymmetric non - markovian fluctuations pertinent to fractal gating dynamics of the locust bk ion channel several new features have been revealed .",
    "( i ) the expected diminishment of the spa - measure relative to the markovian case does not occur .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that one of the rdts in the considered case is strictly exponential similar the markovian case .",
    "( ii ) for asymmetric markovian systems the spa - measure ceases to be frequency - dependent for small adiabatic frequencies .",
    "the non - markovian effects , however , introduce at low driving frequencies a distinct dependence , both for the spa and the snr .",
    "this latter phenomenon can be used to detect and establish a strong non - markovian behavior in practice .",
    "our novel non - markovian theory of stochastic resonance possesses a whole range of applications and we hope that it will be used by the practitioners in their further research work on stochastic resonance .",
