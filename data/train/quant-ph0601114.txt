    "quantum cloning is impossible @xcite .",
    "this means that one can not produce a number of independent physical systems prepared in identical states out of a smaller amount of systems prepared in the same state . since the formulation of the no - cloning theorem the search for quantum devices that can perform cloning with the highest possible fidelity gave rise to a whole branch in the literature .",
    "optimal cloners have been found , for qubits @xcite , for general finite - dimensional systems @xcite , for restricted sets of input states @xcite , and for infinite - dimensional systems such as harmonic oscillators  the so called continuous variables cloners @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of mixed states , a different type of cloning transformation can be considered  the so - called _",
    "broadcasting_in which the output copies are in a globally correlated state whose local `` reduced '' states are identical to the input states",
    ". this possibility has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that broadcasting a single copy from a noncommuting set of density matrices is always impossible .",
    "later , such a result has been considered in the literature as the generalization of the no - cloning theorem to mixed states .",
    "however , more recently , for qubits an effect called _ superbroadcasting _",
    "@xcite has been discovered , which consists in the possibility of broadcasting the state while even increasing the purity of the local state , for at least @xmath3 input copies , and for sufficiently short input bloch vector ( and even for @xmath4 input copies for phase - covariant broadcasting instead of universal covariance @xcite ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we analyze the broadcasting of continuous variable mixed states by a signal - preserving map .",
    "more precisely , this means that we consider a set of states obtained by displacing a fixed mixed state by a complex amplitude in the harmonic oscillator phase space , while the broadcasting map is covariant with respect to the ( weyl - heisenberg ) group of complex displacements .",
    "we will focus mainly on displaced thermal states ( which are equivalent to coherent states that have suffered gaussian noise ) , however , all results of the present paper hold in terms of noise of conjugated quadratures for the set of states obtained by displacing any fixed state .",
    "as we will see , superbroadcasting is possible for continuous variable mixed states , namely one can produce a larger number of copies , which are purified locally on each use , and with the same signal of the input . for displaced thermal states , for example , superbroadcasting can be achieved for at least @xmath5 input copies , with thermal photon number @xmath6 , whereas , for sufficiently large @xmath7 at the input , one can broadcast to an unbounded number @xmath8 of output copies . for purification ( i.e. @xmath9 ) , quite surprisingly the purification rate is @xmath10 , independently on @xmath8 .",
    "the particular case of 2 to 1 for noisy coherent states has been reported in ref .",

    "we consider the same problem for purification ( i.e. @xmath11 ) . in section [ phaconj ]",
