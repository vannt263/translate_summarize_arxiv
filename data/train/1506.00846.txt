    "the experiments of relativistic heavy ion collision at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern seem to have created a hot matter that is most likely to be composed of quarks and gluons , i.e. , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "one of the most surprising findings is that the created matter is well described by the hydrodynamics with tiny dissipation @xcite .",
    "such a finding prompted an interest in the origin of the viscosity in the gauge theories and also the dissipative hydrodynamic equation .",
    "the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic equation is also utilized in analyzing various high - energy astrophysical phenomena @xcite including the accelerated expansion of the universe by bulk viscosity of dark matter and/or dark energy @xcite .",
    "one must say , however , that the theory of relativistic hydrodynamics for a viscous fluid has not been established on a firm ground yet , although there have been many important studies since eckart s pioneering work @xcite : a naive relativistic extension of the navier - stokes equation has fundamental problems such as ambiguity of flow velocity @xcite , existence of unphysical instabilities @xcite , and lack of causality @xcite , the last of which motivated people to introduce the second - order hydrodynamic equation .",
    "the way of formulation of the second - order hydrodynamics is , however , controversial and an established equation has not been obtained although some suggestive and promising approaches have been proposed .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that the second - order hydrodynamic equation that is free from the causality problem even in the non - relativistic regime is not yet established , either .",
    "the causality problem inherent in the first - order equation , which we call generically the navier - stokes equation , appears as the instantaneous propagation of information , which is attributed to parabolicity of the equation @xcite . in the seminal paper by grad @xcite",
    ", he showed that the causality problem could be circumvented by the moment method , which now bears his name : it is found that the thirteen - moment approximation to the functional forms of the distribution function leads to a hyperbolic non - relativistic equation satisfying the causality , with finite propagation speeds of physical quantities . here",
    ", we make a sideremark that the description by the grad equation may be called _ mesoscopic _",
    "@xcite since it occupies an intermediate level between the descriptions by the navier - stokes equation and the boltzmann equation ; see also @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the dynamics described by the grad equation has been recently shown inconsistent with the underlying boltzmann equation in the mesoscopic scales of space and time @xcite .",
    "indeed , grad s moment method lacks a principle for determining the functional form of the distribution function that is consistent with the underlying boltzmann equation , and then it is inevitable for the moment method to adopt an ad - hoc but seemingly plausible ansatz for it .",
    "although there are subsequent attempts to construct the equation that respects both of the causality and the consistency with the boltzmann equation in the mesoscopic regime @xcite , the consistency between the resultant equations and the mesoscopic dynamics of the boltzmann equation remains unclear .",
    "nevertheless , many attempts were made to extend grad s moment method to establish a mesoscopic description of a _ relativistic _ system @xcite , but with only a partial success , as anticipated .",
    "for instance , the celebrated israel - stewart equation @xcite , which is a typical second - order relativistic hydrodynamic equation derived from the boltzmann equation based on the moment method with fourteen moments employed is found to be incomplete if not incorrect because the solutions behave differently from those of the relativistic boltzmann equation quantitatively @xcite .",
    "the incompleteness or incorrectness can be traced back to ambiguous heuristic assumptions inherent in the moment method .",
    "quite recently , however , some heuristic but promising methods have been proposed @xcite to get rid of such drawbacks , and it seems that the resultant solutions indeed become closer to that of the boltzmann equation .",
    "although their results are encouraging , one must say that their derivation are still based on plausible but ambiguous assumptions that require a microscopic foundation .",
    "in fact , the constitutive equations contain the second - order spatial derivatives of the hydrodynamical variables , which necessarily leads to the parabolicity that should have been avoided .",
    "recently , the mesoscopic dynamics or the second - order dynamics that respects the causality has been extracted from the boltzmann equation for the non - relativistic case in the classical regime without recourse to any ansatz for the functional forms of the distribution function by two of the present authors @xcite : there `` the renormalization - group ( rg ) method '' @xcite was adopted as a powerful method of the reduction theory of dynamical systems to reduce the boltzmann equation to the mesoscopic dynamics .",
    "the basic observation in these works is that the first - order hydrodynamics is the slow dynamics achieved asymptotically in the kinetic equation @xcite : the asymptotic dynamics is described by the zero modes of the linearized collision operator , which happen to be temperature , density , and fluid velocity , i.e. , the hydrodynamic variables . in terms of the reduction theory of dynamical systems @xcite , it means that the hydrodynamic variables constitute the natural coordinates of the invariant / attractive manifold of the space of the distribution function in which the asymptotic dynamics in the hydrodynamical regime is described . in the rg method , the hydrodynamic variables , which is now the would - be zero modes , acquire the time dependence by the rg equation .",
    "the resultant evolution equation is nothing but the hydrodynamic equation , the navier - stokes equation .",
    "then , the extension to the extraction of the mesoscopic dynamics consists of developing the way to include some excited ( fast ) modes properly as additional components of the invariant / attractive manifold ; note that the mesoscopic dynamics is faster than that described by the navier - stokes equation .",
    "in @xcite , the following natural conditions are found to give the adequate excited modes to be incorporated in the hydrodynamical variables in the classical and non - relativistic case : ( a )  the resultant dynamics should be consistent with the reduced dynamics obtained by employing only the zero modes in the asymptotic regime ; ( b )  the resultant dynamics should be as simple as possible because we are interested to reduce the dynamics to a simpler one ; the term  simple \" means that the resultant dynamics is described with a fewer number of dynamical variables and is given by an equation composed of a fewer number of terms . here",
    ", we note that the latter principle ( b ) is one of the fundamental principle of the reduction theory of the dynamics as emphasized by kuramoto @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these conditions lead to a concise scheme called the _ doublet scheme _ , and that the resultant equation with thirteen dynamical variables satisfies the causality in an apparent way and has the same form as that of the grad equation but with different microscopic formulae of the transport coefficients and relaxation times ; the expressions of the transport coefficients coincide with those by the chapman - enskog method @xcite , the novel formulae of the relaxation times allow a natural physical interpretation as the relaxation times .",
    "this is an encouraging result !",
    "a comment is in order here on the relation between this work and @xcite in which the two of the present authors ( k.t . and t.k . )",
    "derived a second - order hydrodynamic equation from the relativistic boltzmann equation on the basis of the rg method .",
    "the derivation presented in @xcite , however , contained an inconclusive part which is , in retrospect , incorrect , unfortunately .",
    "indeed the functional form of the excited modes was not determined so as to solve the boltzmann equation but that adopted in the israel - stewart fourteen - moment method was mistakenly used as a possible solution : it is known that the israel - stewart ansatz does not solve the relativistic boltzmann equation . in this work ,",
    "we first find a proper solution to the relativistic boltzmann equation in the relevant kinetic regime on the basis of an elaborated doublet scheme in the rg method , and thus _ derive _ the functional form of the excited modes that is consistent with the underlying boltzmann equation .",
    "then simply applying the rg equation , we obtain the second - order relativistic hydrodynamic equation , which accordingly gives the correct asymptotic dynamics of the boltzmann equation in the mesoscopic regime .    the present paper is an extension of the previous work @xcite to a relativistic case with the full quantum statistics as well as classical one .",
    "we here remark that preliminary results in the classical case were announced in @xcite . needless to say ,",
    "the quantum statistics is essential in investigating the behavior of a quantum fluid composed of bosons and/or fermions . in the present paper",
    ", we shall give a detailed and complete account of the derivations of the causal hydrodynamic equations within the quantum and classical statistics together with those of the microscopic expressions of the transport coefficients and relaxation times .",
    "we shall also show that a concise and natural derivation is possible for the excited modes that is given by the doublet scheme @xcite on the basis of the very principle of the reduction theory of the dynamics .",
    "moreover , we prove that the propagating velocities of the fluctuations of the hydrodynamical variables do not exceed the light velocity , and hence our seconder - order equation ensures the causality as desired .",
    "it is also shown that the equilibrium state is stable for any perturbation described by our equation .",
    "we give a compact expression of the deviation of the distribution function to be used in the fourteen - moment method .",

    "we emphasize that the inhomogeneity and the ratio of the distribution functions are necessarily of the same order in our asymptotic analysis .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the present asymptotic analysis combined with the perturbative expansion successfully solves the boltzmann equation consistently and leads to the mesoscopic dynamics including the constitutive equations that relate the dissipative quantities and the spatial gradients of the equilibrium quantities .",
