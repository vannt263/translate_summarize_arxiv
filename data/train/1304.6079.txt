    "braneworld models with large extra dimensions @xcite have attracted wide attention owing to their success in solving some open questions in modern physics @xcite . to realize the braneworld idea one should find a mechanism of localization , however , there are some difficulties in this matter within standard brane approaches @xcite .",
    "it is especially economical to consider models with a pure gravitational localization mechanism , since gravity has universal couplings with all matter fields . in this paper",
    "we consider one such scenario within the standing waves braneworld @xcite and explicitly show existence of the universal gravitational trapping of all kinds of matter fields on the brane .",
    "main differences of the model with the most brane scenarios are that our metric _ ansatz _ is time - dependent and contains increasing warp factor",
    ".    the standing waves braneworld is formed by the background solution @xcite : @xmath0 of the coupled einstein and massless ghost scalar field equations . in ( [ metric ] ) @xmath1 denotes the extra space - like coordinate , @xmath2 is a curvature scalar ( we choice increasing warp factor ) , the determinant , @xmath3 is @xmath4-independent and the oscillatory function @xmath5 has the form : @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the oscillation frequency , @xmath8 is an integration constant and @xmath9 is the second - order bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the solution ( [ metric ] ) describes the brane located at the node of the standing bulk wave ( [ u ] ) . in this paper we consider the case with one node , i.e. the function @xmath9 in ( [ u ] ) has a single zero at the position of the brane , @xmath10 .",
    "this is accomplished by the assumption : @xmath11    in the equations of the matter fields , the oscillatory function ( [ u ] ) enters via exponentials .",
    "we suppose that the frequency @xmath7 of standing waves is much larger than the frequencies associated with the energies of particles on the brane and in these equations we can perform the time averaging of oscillating exponents .",
    "non - vanishing averages are expressed by the formula @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the brane at the node of the standing wave ( the point where @xmath14 and @xmath5 vanish ) can be considered as a 4d island , where the matter particles are assumed to be bound .",
    "indeed the system of 5d geodesic equations of motion for a classical particle ( or a photon ) reduces to @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the velocity along the brane and the constant @xmath17 corresponds to the energy of the particle per unit mass ( for massive particles @xmath18 and for photons @xmath19 ) . from ( [ dr ] )",
    "it is clear that the motion towards the extra dimension @xmath1 is possible when @xmath20 the term @xmath21 plays the role of the trapping gravitational potential and there exists maximal distance in the bulk @xmath22 . in the standard brane approach with decreasing warp factor ( @xmath23 ) localization",
    "was achieved due to the fact that the extra space actually is finite @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the increasing of the brane warp factor , @xmath24 , creates the potential well that confines particles .",
    "let us now consider the localization problem of quantum fields with various spin using the brane solution ( [ metric ] ) @xcite . to have localized fields on a brane coupling constants appearing after integration of their lagrangians over the extra",
    "coordinate , @xmath1 , must be non - vanishing and finite . using numerical solutions we shall demonstrate existence of normalizable zero modes of various fields on the brane within the model",
    "in this section , using numerical solutions , it is shown localization of massless modes of the spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 particles on the brane .",
    "at first let us consider 5d massless scalar field .",
    "we assume that for the case @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the typical energy of scalar particles on the brane ) variables can be separated @xcite , @xmath27 capital latin letters numerate 5d coordinates , while greek ones are used for 4d indices .",
    "then the action integral for scalar fields can be split in two parts : @xmath28~,\\ ] ] where prime denotes the derivative with respect to extra coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "we are looking for zero mode solution on the brane , @xmath29 , and assume that energy - momentum along the brane , @xmath30 , obeys the dispersion relation : @xmath31 than the 5d klein - gordon equation after time averaging reduces to @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33        close to the brane the function @xmath34 , which describes oscillatory properties of standing waves , and the extra dimension part of wave function @xmath35 , behave as : @xmath36",
    "so for the equation ( [ xi-2 ] ) we use the boundary conditions : @xmath37 figure 1 shows the numerical solution of the equation ( [ xi-2 ] ) for these boundary conditions for the following values of the parameters : @xmath38 we see that @xmath39 , which governs of probability of scalar particles to reach the bulk , falls off from the brane to zero .",
    "the integrals over @xmath1 in the action ( [ sphi ] ) are convergent if integrand functions decrease stronger than @xmath40 .",
    "figure 2 displays the products of @xmath1 on these integrand functions .",
    "we see that they decrease , i.e. the integrals over @xmath1 in the action ( [ sphi ] ) are convergent , hence 4d scalar fields are localized on the brane .",
    "( [ sphi]).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    recall that the action of scalar fields ( [ sphi ] ) due to the determinant ( [ determinant ] ) contains increasing exponential factor ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is the reason why in the original brane models @xcite the scalar field zero modes with the constant extra dimension parts can be localized on the brane only in the case of decreasing warp factor ( i.e. @xmath23 ) . in our model",
    "the extra part of wave function ( [ solution - s ] ) is not constant , moreover , from figure 1 it is clear that it strongly decreases and according to figure 2 the integrals over @xmath1 in the action ( [ sphi ] ) are convergent .",
    "it is known that the transverse traceless graviton modes obey the equations similar to the massless scalar fields in a curved background .",
    "accordingly , the condition of localization of spin-@xmath42 graviton field is equivalent to that of scalar field considered above @xcite .        in the case of 5d abelian vector fields ( the generalization to the case of non - abelian gauge fields is straightforward ) we are looking for the solution of field equations in the form @xcite : @xmath43 than the 5d action of vector fields",
    "can be written as : @xmath44 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we require the existence of 4d vector zero mode on the brane , @xmath45 where @xmath30 obey dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "then 5d maxwell equations after time averaging yields the single equation for @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath34 is done by ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "close to the brane , @xmath48 , and we set the boundary conditions : @xmath49 from figure 3 we see that the solution of the equation ( [ v ] ) for these boundary conditions , or the probability of photon to leave the brane , falls off in the bulk down to zero .",
    "as for the case of scalar field the integrals over @xmath1 in the vector functions action ( [ vectoraction ] ) are convergent if integrand functions decrease stronger than @xmath40 . from the figure 4",
    "we see that the products of @xmath1 with integrand functions decrease , i.e. the integral over @xmath1 in ( [ vectoraction ] ) is convergent and 4d photon is localized on the brane .    )",
    ".,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in 5d brane models the implementation of pure gravitational trapping mechanism of vector field particles remains the most problematic @xcite .",
    "the reason is that in the vector action ( [ vectoraction ] ) the extra dimension parts of the determinant ( [ determinant ] ) and two metric tensors with upper indices cancel each other .",
    "because of this in the original brane models the vector field zero modes ( with the constant extra dimension part ) can not be localized on the brane for any sign of @xmath50 . in our model",
    "the extra dimension part of vector field @xmath46 is rapidly decreasing function ( fig .",
    "3 ) and the integral over @xmath1 in ( [ vectoraction ] ) is convergent .",
    "now we investigate the localization problem for massless fermions @xcite .    for minkowskian @xmath51 gamma matrices we use the weyl basis , @xmath52 and 5d gamma matrices @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "the inverse _ fnfbein _ for the metric ( [ metric ] ) , we choice as : @xmath55    non - vanishing components of the spin - connection in the background ( [ metric ] ) , which enter covariant derivatives defined as : @xmath56 after time averaging are given by : @xmath57    for the wavefunction of the bulk fermion field we use the chiral decomposition : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the extra dimension factors of the left and right fermion wavefunctions respectively .",
    "then the 5d dirac action for massless fermions can be written as : @xmath61 - \\overline \\psi_l \\psi_r \\int dr e^{4a|r|}\\lambda \\left[\\rho ' + 2a~ sgn(r ) \\rho \\right]\\right\\}~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we assume that 4d left and right dirac spinors ( @xmath62 ) are solutions of the free 4d massless dirac equations : @xmath63 where @xmath30 satisfy the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) and the constant 2-spinors @xmath64 and @xmath65 obey : @xmath66    derived from ( [ spinoraction ] ) 5d dirac equation , after time averaging , takes the form : @xmath67\\psi -\\gamma^5 \\left[2a ~sgn(r ) + \\partial_r \\right]\\psi = 0~.\\ ] ] using the expressions ( [ psi - free ] ) and ( [ relations ] ) it can be rewritten as the system : @xmath68&\\sigma^i{\\cal p}_i(r)\\\\ - \\sigma^i{\\cal p}_i(r)&e^{a|r|}\\left[2a ~sgn(r ) + \\partial_r \\right ] \\end{array } \\right)\\left ( \\begin{array}{*{10}{c } } \\rho ( r)r\\\\ \\lambda ( r)l\\end{array } \\right ) = 0~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced the functions @xmath69 : @xmath70 p_x , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal p}_y ( r ) & = & \\left(\\left\\langle e^{-u/2 } \\right\\rangle - 1 \\right)p_y = \\left[i_0\\left(z/2\\right)-1\\right ] p_y , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal p}_z ( r ) & = & \\left(\\left\\langle e^{u } \\right\\rangle - 1 \\right)p_z = \\left[i_0\\left(z\\right)-1\\right ] p_z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is defined in ( [ u ] ) .        to find boundary conditions for the system ( [ l - r ] ) note that from the last two terms of ( [ spinoraction ] ) we see that the action is even under the @xmath72 orbifold symmetry",
    "if @xmath73 is an even function of @xmath1 and @xmath74 is odd ( or vice versa ) with respect to the transformation @xmath75 .",
    "we require , @xmath76 what can be accomplished if we impose that the bulk fermion wavefunction is even under five - dimensional parity @xcite : @xmath77 then from the symmetry of the problem with respect to the transformation @xmath75 we get the following important boundary conditions : @xmath78    solutions of the dirac equations ( [ l - r ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ baundary ] ) are displayed on the figure 5 .",
    "we see that in our model the extra dimension part of the left spinor wave function @xmath59 has maximum on the brane and decreases in the bulk .",
    "while , as a consequence of ( [ baundary ] ) , in our setup the right fermionic modes are absent on the brane and @xmath79 has maximum in the bulk outside the brane .",
    "integrals over @xmath1 in the spinor field action ( [ spinoraction ] ) are convergent if integrand functions decrease stronger than @xmath40 .",
    "this feature for ( [ spinoraction ] ) is demonstrated on the figure 6 .",
    "so in our model left massless fermions are localized on the brane and right fermions are localized in the bulk .",
    "( [ spinoraction]).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "in this section we want to estimate masses of kaluza - klein excitations .    for simplicity let us consider the case of 5d scalar particles . for a massive mode the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] )",
    "takes the form : @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the mass of lightest kk mode on the brane .",
