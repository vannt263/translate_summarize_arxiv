    "stars are detectable as x - ray sources at several important stages of their lives .",

    "massive ob and wolf - rayet stars produce x - rays through shocks in their stellar winds @xcite , and possibly from magnetically - confined plasma close to their stellar surfaces @xcite .",
    "neutron stars are bright x - ray sources if they are young and still have latent heat from what was once the stellar core @xcite , if they accelerate particles in rotating , moderate - strength ( @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 g ) fields @xcite , or if they have extremely strong fields ( @xmath7@xmath8@xmath10 g ) that decay and accelerate particles @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes are bright x - ray sources if they are accreting matter from a binary companion @xcite , or in principle from the interstellar medium ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , x - ray surveys can be used to study the life cycles of stars , particularly their start and end points .    here",
    "we present a catalog of x - ray sources detected in _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations toward the inner 2@xmath1  by 0.8@xmath1  of the galaxy .",
    "the region encompasses about 1% of the galactic stellar mass @xcite , and possibly up to 10% of the galactic population of young , massive stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , these data provide a statistically meaningful sample of the galactic stellar population .",
    "previous catalogs based on _ chandra _  data on the galactic center have been published by @xcite using 630 ks of data taken through 2002 june on the central 17@xmath017  around , and by @xcite using observations taken through 2005 june on the inner 2@xmath1@xmath00.8@xmath1  of the galaxy . however , since the publication of these catalogs , a large amount of new data have been obtained .",
    "these data increase the number of point sources identified by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "they also provide much better astrometry for individual x - ray sources .",
    "the improvement in astrometry enables the identification of rare objects such as wolf - rayet stars , x - ray binaries , and rotation - powered pulsars , through comparisons of our x - ray catalog with radio and infrared data sets ( e.g. , mauerhan , j. , in prep ) .",
    "therefore , we provide here an updated catalog of point sources , which incorporates and supercedes the previous catalogs .",
    "we also describe the spatial and luminosity distributions of the x - ray sources .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a distance to the galactic center of @xmath11=8  kpc @xcite , and an average absorption column of @xmath12=@xmath13  @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "as of 2007 august , the central 2@xmath1@xmath00.8@xmath1  of the milky way has been observed with the imaging array of the _ chandra_advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on numerous occasions .",
    "the majority of the new sources in this catalog come from 600 ks of exposure that we obtained in fifteen 40 ks pointings covering @xmath61@xmath1  of the galactic center .",
    "the new data since 2005 also includes 370 ks on the central 20 pc around , 100  ks on the arches cluster @xcite , and 100  ks on sgr c. we also include sources previously identified in 630 ks of data on the inner 20 pc around  @xcite ; thirty 12 ks exposures of the 2@xmath1@xmath00.8@xmath1  survey obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also muno  2006a ) ; and deep pointings toward the radio arches ( 50 ks ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sgr b2 ( 100 ks ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dates , observation identifiers ( obsids ) , durations , locations , roll angles , and some values relevant for the astrometry (  2.1 ) for each exposure are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the observations in the table are sorted by right ascension and declination , so that observations near the same point are grouped .",
    "the acis - i is a set of four , 1024-by-1024 pixel ccds , covering a field of view of 17  by 17 .",
    "when placed on - axis at the focal plane of the grazing - incidence x - ray mirrors , the imaging resolution is determined primarily by the pixel size of the ccds , 0492 .",
    "the ccd frames are read out every 3.2  s , which provides the nominal time resolution of the data .",
    "the ccds also measure the energies of incident photons within a calibrated energy band of 0.58  kev , with a resolution of 50300 ev ( depending on photon energy and distance from the read - out node ) .",
    "however in some of the earlier , shallow exposures ( obsids 2267 through 2296 ) , an event filter was employed on the satellite that removed x - rays with energies below 1 kev before the data were sent to the ground .",
    "the lack of 0.51.0 kev photons had a minor impact on our results , because there were only 76 sources that were detected below 2  kev for which the photometry was derived entirely from the obsids 2267 through 2296.25% .",
    "the soft color is also systematically high .",
    "for instance , sources with @xmath15 @xmath14 will have @xmath16@xmath6@xmath17 using a 0.52.0 kev soft band , and @xmath16@xmath6@xmath18 using a 1.02.0 kev soft band .",
    "] we omitted obsid 242 from our analysis , because it was taken with the detector at a cooler temperature ( 110 k , versus 120 k ) . a flux image and composite exposure map",
    "is displayed in figure  [ fig : obs ] , and an adaptively - smoothed three - color image is displayed in figure  [ fig : rgb ] .",
    "the data were processed using the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) package .",
    "the data were processed as they arrived , so we used ciao versions 3.3 and 3.4 .",
    "information on the detectors was taken from the calibration database ( caldb ) versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.0 .",
    "the differences between the two versions of the software were too minor to justify re - processing the older portions of the dataset .",
    "we only used data from acis - i ; data from the s array was omitted because was offset far from the aim point , and the large point spread function on the detector resulted in bad stellar confusion .",
    "we started with the level 1 event files provided by the _ chandra_x - ray center ( cxc ) , and reprocessed the data using the tool acis_process_events in order to remove pixel randomization and apply more recent energy calibration .",
    "we then removed events associated with bad pixels , and applied the standard grade filters to the events and good - time filters supplied by the cxc .",
    "we applied acis_run_hotpix to flag events associated with cosmic - rays , and removed them from the event list ( we did not run acis_detect_afterglow , because it sometimes removes genuine x - ray events .",
    "we did , however , later remove sources that were cosmic ray afterglows ; see  2.2 ) .",
    "we then searched each observation for time intervals when particles encountering the detector caused the background event rate to flare to @xmath193@xmath4 above the mean level , and removed them .",
    "these background flares were found in 12 observations , and lasted @xmath35% of the duration of each observation .",
    "next , we applied the sub - pixel event repositioning algorithm of @xcite .",
    "finally , if an astrometric correction was available from the cxc for any observation , we applied it at this point , by modifying the header keywords for the event file , and by correcting the columns for the right ascension and declination in the aspect solution provided with the observation .    before proceeding to explain our algorithms for source detection",
    ", we would like to explain some minor weaknesses of our approach .",
    "unfortuantely , because the data were searched for sources as they arrived , and because the exposures were highly non - uniform across the field , some parameters of our detection algorithm , particularly the detection threshholds , were not kept consistent . to compensate for this , we did two things .",
    "first , we verified the reality of each source as part of our photometric algorithm (  2.2 ) .",
    "this should eliminate most spurious sources on the faint end , in a uniform manner .",
    "second , we determined the completeness limits of our survey using monte carlo simulations that mimicked our source detection algorithms (  2.3 ) .",
    "this is the best way to establish what portion of our sample is complete . with the experience we have gained , in principle we could develop a more streamlined and straightforward approach to building the inital catalog .",
    "however , it would take several months of computer time to reprocess the data , or a similar amount of time re - writing our software to be more efficient .",
    "the improvements in the final catalog would be slight , so we decided not to delay releasing our catalog any further .",
    "we are making the data products from the following sections available in fits format from a web site .",
    "the catalog itself will also be available with the electronic version of the paper .",
    "source detection and localization was approached iteratively .",
    "we first searched for point sources in each observation separately .",
    "the locations of the point sources found in the first stage were used to refine the astrometry .",
    "second , the astrometrically - corrected images were combined to search for fainter point sources .",
    "finally , the source lists from the individual observations were merged with those from the combined images .",
    "we searched each observation individually for point sources using the wavelet decomposition algorithm wavdetect @xcite .",
    "we employed the default `` mexican hat '' wavelet , and used a sensitivity threshold of @xmath20 .",
    "this threshold roughly corresponds to the chance of detecting a spurious source in an area corresponding to the point spread function ( psf ) , if the local background is spatially uniform . for the earlier data , taken before 2006 , we used images at three different resolutions : one at 05 resolution covering the inner 1024@xmath01024 pixels , one at 1  resolution covering the inner 2048@xmath02048 pixels , and one at 2  resolution covering the entire field . for later observations",
    ", we simplified the process and used only two resolutions : 05 covering the inner 2048@xmath02048 pixels , and 2  covering the entire field . using a test field",
    ", we confirmed that there was no difference in the number of sources detected using the two techniques ; the only difference is that the technique that used three , smaller images was computationally faster .",
    "we used wavelet scales that increased by a factor of @xmath21 , over the range of 14 pixels for the 05 image , 18 pixels for the 1  image , and 116 pixels for the 2  image . for each resolution",
    ", we made images in three energy bands : 0.58.0  kev to cover the full bandpass , 0.52.0  kev to provide sensitivity to foreground sources , and 48 kev to provide sensitivity to highly - absorbed sources . for each image ,",
    "a matching exposure map was generated for photons with an energy of 4  kev , so that the wavelet algorithm could keep track of regions with rapidly - varying exposure , such as bad columns and the edges of the ccds .",
    "the lists derived from each image resolution were combined to form master source lists for each energy band .",
    "we found that the positions would be most accurate from the sources identified in the image with the finest resolution .",
    "therefore , we discarded sources from the lower - resolution images if their separations from sources identified at high resolution were smaller than the radii of the 90% contour of the psf .",
    "in this way , we produced three lists for each observation , one for each energy band .",
    "next , we used the point sources detected so far to register the absolute astrometry to the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 2mass frame is consistent with the international celestrial reference system to within 15 mas .",
    "we compared the positions of 2mass sources to those of x - ray sources detected in the 0.52.0 kev band that were identified by wavdetect as having @xmath223@xmath4 significance , and identified matches as those with offsets @xmath31 .",
    "the offsets between the 2mass and _ chandra _  frames were computed using a least - chi - squared algorithm .",
    "the x - ray sources that we used for astrometry are flagged in table  [ tab : positions ] ( see  [ sec : tdesc ] ) .    for observations longer than 20 ks",
    ", we found between 3 and 36 x - ray sources in the soft band that could be associated unambiguously with stars in the 2mass catalog , and so we used the average offsets between the x - ray and infrared sources to correct the astrometry of the x - ray observations .",
    "we evaluated the accuracy of the registration based on the standard deviation in the mean of the offsets of the individual stars .",
    "the registraton was accurate to 006 for the deepest exposures , and to 02 for the shallower ones ( 1@xmath4 ) .",
    "unfortunately , for exposures shorter than 20  ks , too few x - ray sources were found with 2mass counterparts to correct the astrometry to better than the default value , 05 ( 1@xmath4 ) .",
    "once the deepest observation at each point was registered to the 2mass frame , the shallower observations were registered using the offsets of x - ray sources detected in the 0.58.0 kev band in pairs of observations . between 2 and 759 x - ray sources matched between the deepest and shallower observations , depending upon the exposure time of the shallower observation .",
    "the uncertainty in the astrometry of each observation is listed in the last column of table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the composite image and exposure map for our survey are displayed in figure  [ fig : obs ] .",
    "having corrected the astrometry for fields that included deep observations , we then combined subsets of the images in order to perform a deeper search for point sources .",
    "two wavelet algorithms were used , on the series of images listed below .",
    "first , the tool wavdetect @xcite was used to identify point sources in :    * composite images made from all of the observations of .",
    "twelve , 1024@xmath01024 images were made , in four resolutions ( 025 , 05 , 1 , and 2 ) and using three energy bands for each resolution ( 0.58.0  kev , 0.52.0  kev , and 48  kev ) . *",
    "three sets of composite images made from observations of in 2002 , 2004 , and 2005 .",
    "these images were designed to be sensitive to faint , variable sources .",
    "the same image resolutions and energy bands were used as for the composite image of all of the  data .",
    "* composite images made from three pointings that were taken with same same roll angle , because the original 40  ks exposure had to be split up to accomodate scheduling constraints ( obsids 7038 , 7041 , and 7042 ) .",
    "three images were made for each aimpoint , one for each of the 0.58.0  kev , 0.52.0  kev , and 48  kev energy bands .",
    "each image was made at 05 resolution , and had 2048@xmath02048 pixels .",
    "the parameters used with wavdetect were the same as for the individual observations .",
    "second , we used the tools wvdecomp and findpeak in the _ zhtools _ package written by a.  vikhlinin to search for faint sources that fell below the wavdetect threshold .",
    "we searched on wavelet scales of 13 pixels , and required that a candidate source be identified with a minimum signal - to - noise of 4.5 , corresponding to 16 spurious sources per 2048 by 2048 pixel image .",
    "five iterations of the search procedure were performed .",
    "the tool wvdecomp iteratively cleans the image of point sources identified in previous passes through the data , so it is more efficient at separating close pairs of sources .",
    "moreover , unlike wavdetect , wvdecomp does not use any information about the shape of the point spread function in searching for sources , so it is better at identifying point sources when observations with very different aimpoints have been combined .",
    "therefore , we used wvdecomp on composite images generated from all data covering the positions at which deep observations were obtained ( i.e. , obsids 3392 , 4500 , 5892 , 70347048 , and 944 ) . each image was produced with 2048@xmath02048 pixels at 05 resolution for the 0.58.0 kev band .",
    "we then generated a list containing the unique sources , by merging the lists generated by wavdetect from individual observations and from combined images , and from the lists generated by wvdecomp .",
    "we found that almost all the duplicates could be removed by identifying sources with separations smaller than the prescription for positional uncertainties in @xcite : for sources offset from the center of each image by @xmath23@xmath35 , the separation was cut at 06 , whereas for larger offsets it was cut at @xmath24 ( @xmath23 is in arcmin ) .",
    "for each image , we gave preference to positions from the full - band sources , then from the soft sources , and finally from the hard sources . across observations , the priority was given to the deeper observations , and to sources detected with wavdetect over those detected with wvdecomp .",
    "we examined the final list visually by comparing it to images of the survey fields , and we removed several hundred sources that were portions of extended , diffuse features ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a couple dozen duplicates that were not identified automatically .",
    "finally , two sources were not picked up by the detection algorithms because they were blended with nearby , brighter sources .",
    "we added these to our catalog by hand ( cxougc j174502.8282505 and j174617.4281246 ) .    at this stage , we considered our source lists to be provisional , both because the search algorithms used non - uniform parameters , and because the large , spatially - variable background was likely to cause our wavelet algorithms to generate a significant number of spurious sources . in order to confirm their validity , we next computed photometry for each provisional source .",
    "we computed aperture photometry for each source using the package , versions 3.96 , 3.101 , and 3.128 @xcite , along with some custom code .",
    "the algorithm proceeded in several steps .",
    "first , for each source and each observation , we obtained a model psf with the ciao tool mkpsf . for most sources",
    ", we used a psf for a fiducial energy of 4.5 kev .",
    "however , if a source was only detected with wavdetect in the soft band , we used a psf for an energy of 1.5 kev . to determine a region from which we would extract source counts , we then constructed a polygon enclosing 90% of the psf .",
    "if the polygons for two sources overlapped in the observations in which the sources were closest to the aim - point , we generated a smaller polygon .",
    "the final extraction regions enclosed between 70% and 90% of the psf . sources for which the psf fraction was @xmath390% were considered to be confused . moreover , because the psf grows rapidly beyond 7  from the aim - point , we also considered sources to be confused if they were located beyond 7  from the aim - point and their psfs overlapped .",
    "photometry was not computed for observations in which confused sources fell @xmath227off - axis .",
    "fortunately , these second type of confused sources were always located on - axis in another observation , or else they would not have been identified .",
    "finally , for similar reasons , we only computed photometry for sources that lay within 7  of if the relevant observations had  as the aim point .",
    "second , we extracted source event lists , source spectra , effective area functions , and response matrices for each source in each observation .",
    "the detector responses and effective areas were obtained using the ciao tools mkacisrmf and mkarf , respectively . for each source , the spectra from all of the relevant observations were summed .",
    "the responses and effective areas were averaged , weighted by the exposures in each observation .",
    "third , we extracted background events from circular regions surrounding each point source in each observation , omitting events that fell within circles that circumscribed @xmath690% of the psfs around any point sources .",
    "the background regions were chosen to contain @xmath6100 total counts for the wide survey , and @xmath61000 total counts for the deeper  field .",
    "fewer than 1% of the counts in the background region originate from known point sources . for each source ,",
    "the background spectra from all of the relevant observations were scaled by the integrals of the exposure maps ( in units of @xmath25 s ) over the source and background regions , and then summed to create composite background spectra .",
    "fourth , we eliminated spurious sources .",
    "we compared the number of source and background counts to estimate the probability that no source was present , based on poisson statistics @xcite . if a source had a @xmath2210% chance of being spurious , we eliminated it from our catalog .",
    "we eliminated 1962 sources in this way .",
    "we also eliminated sources in which the majority of events were cosmic ray afterglows . specifically , we removed 46 sources because the events associated with the candidate source fell in a single pixel during 510 consecutive frames .",
    "our final catalog contains 9017 x - ray sources , and is listed in table  [ tab : positions ] .",
    "the majority of sources , 7152 , were found with wavdetect . of the sources detected with wavdetect ,",
    "4823 were detected in the full band , 948 in the soft band , and 1381 in the hard band .",
    "another 1865 sources were only detected with wvdecomp . in the  field alone , we found 3441 sources with wavdetect , of which 2715 were detected in the full composite image , 275 in 2002 , 48 in 2004 , 90 in 2005 , and 313 in individual observations .",
    "an additional 364 were found in the  field with wvdecomp .",
    "fifth , we compared the source and background spectra using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic , in order to flag potentially - spurious objects that could be variations in the background .",
    "caution should be used when studying sources that resemble the background .",
    "for instance , in the central parsec around , there is an over - abundance of faint ( @xmath26@xmath27 ) , soft point sources that have spectra consistent with that of the background warm plasma ( note that almost all of the excess bright sources that we discuss in  3.1 do have spectra that are distinct from the background ) .",
    "therefore , we suspect that most of these are @xmath80.1  pc scale variations in the density of that plasma . unfortunately , we can not be certain .",
    "indeed , the spectrum of the bright x - ray source associated with irs  13 ( cxougc  j174539.7290029 ) resembles the background according to the ks test .",
    "if the diffuse background is merely unresolved point sources @xcite , then most faint point sources should have spectra that resemble the background .",
    "sixth , we computed the net counts in the 0.52.0  kev , 2.08.0  kev , 2.03.3  kev , 3.34.7  kev , and 4.78.0  kev bands .",
    "we estimated the photon flux from each source , by dividing the net counts by the average of the effective area function in each band .",
    "table  [ tab : phot ] lists the 0.52.0 kev and the 28 kev flux , the latter of which is the sum of the fluxes in the three sub - bands .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumdist ] displays histograms of the net counts and fluxes in the 0.52.0  kev and 28  kev bands .",
    "histograms of upper limits are also plotted , for sources that were detected in one band but not the other .",
    "finally , using custom code that was not part of acis extract , we computed 90% uncertainties on the net counts in each band , through a bayesian analysis of the poisson statistics , with the simplifying assumption that the uncertainty on the background is negligible @xcite .",
    "we used the net counts to compute the hardness ratios @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the numbers of counts in the higher and lower energy bands , respectively .",
    "the resulting hardness ratios are bounded by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we defined a soft color using counts in the 2.03.3  kev and 0.52.0  kev bands ( @xmath16 ) , a medium color using counts in the 3.34.7  kev bands and 2.03.3  kev ( @xmath33 ) , and a hard color using counts in the 4.78.0  kev and 3.34.7  kev bands ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we calculated uncertainties on the ratios using the 90% uncertainties on the net counts and equation  1.31 in lyons ( 1991 ; page 26 ) .",
    "the hardness ratios are listed in table  [ tab : phot ] , and histograms showing their distributions are displayed in figure  [ fig : hrdist ] .    the soft color , @xmath16 , was used to distinguish foreground sources from objects that were likely to lie near or beyond the galactic center .",
    "we select foreground x - ray sources as those with soft colors in the range @xmath35@xmath36@xmath16@xmath3@xmath37 , which corresponds to absorption columns equivalent to @xmath12@xmath26@xmath38  @xmath14 .",
    "most of these should lie within 4 kpc of earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we selected x - ray sources that were located near or beyond the galactic center as those either that had soft colors @xmath16@xmath19@xmath37 , or that were not detected in either of the 0.52.0 and 2.03.3  kev bands .",
    "this x - ray selection corresponds to absorption columns equivalent to @xmath12@xmath39@xmath38  @xmath14 .",
    "we find 2257 foreground x - ray sources , and 6760 sources near or beyond the galactic center .",
    "foreground and absorbed sources are plotted separately in figure  [ fig : hrdist ] . most absorbed sources do not have measured soft colors .",
    "we searched for variability using the arrival times of the events .",
    "we searched for three kinds of variations : long - term variations that occurred between observations , short - term variability within individual observations , and periodic variability within individual observations .",
    "we searched for variations that occurred between observations by comparing the event arrival times from all of the observations to a constant flux model using the ks statistic . any source with a @xmath30.1% chance of being described by a constant flux model",
    "was considered to vary on long time scales .",
    "there were 856 sources that exhibited long - term variability , 137 of which also exhibited short - term variability .",
    "therefore , about 10% of sources vary on the day to month time scales between observations .",
    "we characterized these long - term variations by computing the mean photon flux during each observation of a variable source .",
    "table  [ tab : longterm ] lists the source name , observations in which the largest and smallest fluxes were observed , the values of the largest and smallest fluxes , and the ratios of those values .",
    "figure  [ fig : longterm ] compares the amplitude of the variations to the maximum flux . in order to exclude measurements with poor signal - to - noise",
    ", the largest flux was defined as the measurement with the largest lower limit , and the smallest flux was defined as the measurement with the smallest upper limit . in most ( 740 ) cases ,",
    "the smallest flux was consistent with zero , and the lower limit to the flux ratios was provided . in 224 cases , the uncertainties in the largest and",
    "smallest fluxes overlapped , and the formal lower limit to the ratio was less than 1 .",
    "the statistics on faint sources with low - amplitude variability tended to be poor , so table  [ tab : longterm ] would be best used to identify highly - variable sources for further study .",
    "we searched for variability within each observation by comparing the light curves to constant count rate models using the ks statistic .",
    "if the arrival times of events had a @xmath30.1% chance of being described by a uniform distribution , we considered a source to have short - term variability .",
    "we identified 294 sources , or 3% of our sample , as having clear short - term variations .",
    "we roughly characterized the nature of the variability by dividing each time series into intervals that were consistent with having constant count rates , using the bayesian blocks algorithm of @xcite . in brief , the algorithm compared the probability that an interval could be described by two different count rates to the null hypothesis that the photons arrived with a single rate .",
    "if the ratio of the two probabilities exceeded a user - specified prior odds ratio , then the interval was divided at the time that produced two intervals with the largest calculated likelihood .",
    "this process was iterated until no sub - intervals were divided any further .",
    "we chose to apply the algorithm in order to describe each variable light curve with the fewest intervals with distinct rates ( blocks ) .",
    "we applied three progressively looser odds ratios , successively demanding that the probability for the two - rate model exceed the null hypothesis by factors of 1000 , 100 , and 10 if the larger odds ratio failed to identify a change point . in this way",
    ", large flares were described with a few `` blocks '' using a large odds ratio , whereas small - amplitude variations were still characterized using a smaller odds ratio .",
    "this approach was deemed necessary in part because the bayesian interpretation of the odds ratios does not have a good frequentist analog that could be compared to the probabilities returned by the ks test , and in part because the ks test and the bayesian blocks tests are most sensitive to slightly different forms of variability .",

    "the minimum flux was consistent with zero , so the ratio represents a lower limit to the variability amplitude .",
    "we find that all variations had time scales of @xmath2210 minutes .",
    "the amplitudes ranged from barely - detectable 30% variations in the flux ( cxougc j174534.8290851 ) , to one flare in which the flux increased by a factor of 250 ( cxougc j174700.7283205 ) .",

    "we calculated the sensitivity of our observations using synthetic - star tests , following the basic methods described in @xcite and muno  ( 2006a ; see wang 2004 for another approach ) .",
    "we generated maps of our sensitivity both for each of the stacked observations ( i.e. , centered on obsids 3392 , 4500 , 5892 , 70347048 , and 944 ) , and for a fiducial field with an exposure time of 12 ks for those regions only covered by the shallow exposures of @xcite . in brief , for each pointing , we generated a background map by ( 1 ) removing events from within a circle circumscribing @xmath690% of the energy of the psf around each detected source , and then ( 2 ) filling the `` holes '' in the image with numbers of counts drawn from poisson distributions with means equal to those of surrounding annuli .",
    "we then simulated 100 star fields per pointing .",

    "we converted these fluxes to expected values for the numbers of counts using an exposure map .",
    "the exposure map was normalized to produce the mean flux - to - counts conversion for x - ray sources located at or beyond the galactic center ( @xmath55 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "then , to account for the eddington bias , we drew observed numbers of counts from poisson distributions with mean values equal to the expected counts .",
    "next , we obtained model images of the psf from the routine mkpsf , averaged them when appropriate , and used the composite psf as the probability distribution to simulate the 2-dimensional image of the counts .",
    "these were added to the synthetic exposure . finally , we searched the synthetic image for point sources using for the 12 ks exposures , and wvdecomp for the stacked observations . by comparing the input and output lists , we estimated the minimum flux at which a source would be detected in 50% and 90% of trials over a grid of points covering our survey .",
    "we interpolated between these points to make a map of the sensitivity for each image .",
    "none of our observations are formally confusion - limited at our completeness limits ( hogg 2001 ; see also muno  2003 ) .",
    "if the background diffuse x - ray emission is unresolved stellar sources , then confusion caused by undetected sources is accounted for naturally by our background maps .    in order to produce a global sensitivity map , we combined the sensitivity maps from the above simulations by recording the best sensitivity at each point in the image .",
    "the map of 90% confidence limits is displayed in figure  [ fig : sens ] .",
    "the effective area of the survey as a function of limiting photon flux and luminosity is displayed in figure  [ fig : area ] .",
    "we are sensitive to @xmath6@xmath2  ( 0.5 - 8.0 kev , assuming @xmath11=8  kpc ) at 90% confidence over one square degree , and to @xmath6@xmath56  over 0.1 square degrees .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath62 improvement over @xcite .",
    "however , we still find that the majority of x - ray sources are detected at fluxes below our completeness limits . of 6760 sources that are likely to lie at or beyond the galactic center ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "only 15% are brighter than the 90% completeness limit at the point at which they were detected , and only 40% are brighter than the 50% completeness limit .",
    "this is caused by two effects .",
    "first , 20% of the sources are detected only in the hard band , whereas our completeness limits are for the full band .",
    "second , the number - flux distribution is steep (  3.3 ) , such that many of the faint sources are only detected because of positive poisson fluctuations in their count rates .",
    "these maps are used in selecting complete samples of sources for measuring the spatial (  3.2 ) and flux (  3.3 ) distributions .",
    "sources below our completeness limits are still securely detected , although other sources with similar intrinsic fluxes have been missed .",
    "experience with matching x - ray and optical sources as part of the _ chandra _  deep fields and orion ultradeep projects suggests that the positions of the x - ray sources can be refined with respect to those provided by the wavelet algorithms @xcite .",
    "therefore , we used the implementations of their techniques in acis extract to refine the positions of our sources . for each source",
    ", we made a composite image by combining the event lists from each relevant observation , and then made a matching composite psf image that we weighted by the values of the exposure maps at the source positions . from this image , we computed two additional estimates for the source position : the mean positions of the events within each source region , and a centroid determined by cross - correlating the psf and source images .",
    "following @xcite , if a source lay within 5  of the aim point , we used the mean position of the events within the source extraction region .",
    "if the source lay beyond 5 , we used the position determined by cross - correlating the source image and psf image .",
    "however , if the offset of the refined position from the wavelet position was larger than the smallest source extraction radius that we used , we assumed that a nearby source had caused confusion , and retained the wavelet position .",
    "unfortunately , we could not empirically calibrate the uncertainties on our source positions , because even the foreground infrared sources had such a high density that @xmath650% of those that fell within 3  of an x - ray source were chance alignments .",
    "therefore , we computed 95% positional uncertainties using equation  5 in @xcite , which is based on the positions of sources reported by wavdetect in simulated observations : @xmath57 \\nonumber \\\\   & + & 0\\farcs03 \\left [ \\frac{\\theta}{\\log_{10}(c + 2)}\\right]^2 +   0\\farcs0006 \\left[\\frac{\\theta}{\\log_{10}(c + 3)}\\right]^4   \\label{eq : posunc}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 is the offset in arcminutes of the source from the nominal aim point , and @xmath58 is the net number of counts . for sources detected in composite images , we defined @xmath58 to be the net counts summed over all observations , and @xmath23 to be the exposure - weighted averages of the sources offsets from the aim points of their respective observations . for sources detected in individual observations",
    ", we defined @xmath58 and @xmath23 to be the values for the observations in which the sources were identified .",
    "if @xmath59 is larger than the smallest radius of the region used to extract photometry for the source ( the `` source radius '' ) , the uncertainty was set equal to the radius of the extraction region .",
    "these sources are marginally detected , and the high background in the galactic center produces a large tail in the distribution of possible positions .",
    "we retained them because they passed all of our other selection criteria .",
    "@xcite established equation  [ eq : posunc ] by running wavdetect on simulated , single observations that were generated using a ray - tracing code .",
    "unfortunately , our observations are more complicated . on the one hand ,",
    "most of the positions are determined from composite images generated from observations with very different aim points .",
    "the inclusion of data with large @xmath23 could add uncertainty to our measurements .",
    "on the other hand , our positions have been refined compared to the wavdetect values , so the uncertainty on some sources could be smaller .",
    "therefore , we view equation  [ eq : posunc ] as a compromise .",
    "nonetheless , a comparison of the offsets between 500 foreground x - ray sources and the blue 2mass sources that are their counterparts ( as described in detail in j. mauerhan , in prep ) reveals that the positions in the new catalog are @xmath660% better than in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also note that because of the way we averaged the psf , the positions and uncertainties for the of sources that vary in flux between observations ( 10% of our sample ) could be mis - estimated .",
