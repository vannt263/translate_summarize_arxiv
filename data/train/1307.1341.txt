    "<S> the consistency of the frequency response predicted by a class of electrochemical impedance expressions is analytically checked by invoking the kramers - kronig ( kk ) relations . </S>",
    "<S> these expressions are obtained in the context of poisson - nernst - planck usual ( pnp ) or anomalous ( pnpa ) diffusional models that satisfy poisson s equation in a finite - length situation . the theoretical results , besides being successful in interpreting experimental data , are also shown to obey the kk relations when these relations are modified accordingly .    </S>",
    "<S> the kramers - kronig ( kk ) relations are the appropriate tool to check the correctness of the frequency response of linear systems by assuring the construction of causal time - domain models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these relations give a condition that is necessary and sufficient to verify if a given frequency response will yield a causal or a non - causal impulse response , without leaving the frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> the kk relations have the origin in the cauchy s theorem that provides the mathematical basis for causality  @xcite . by using the notion of complex refractive index defined by means of an analytical continuation in the complex frequency plane </S>",
    "<S> , kramers  @xcite has shown that a signal can not travel faster than @xmath0 , the velocity of light in vacuo , in any medium for which the dispersion relation is satisfied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , kk relations have been intensively used to readily determine the validity of the data because they involve integral transform techniques that are independent of the physical process considered  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly helpful in the field of the electrochemical impedance or immittance spectroscopy ( eis ) applied to analyze experimental data of various systems . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , eis is a widely used technique for the electrical characterization of electrolytic cells by measuring the response of the material to an applied ac signal  @xcite . at the impedance level , the set of experimental data is commonly analyzed by representing its frequency behavior in the complex plane . in this scenario , to obtain a physically acceptable interpretation of the measured response , besides using appropriate theoretical models , the kk relations have to be used to verify the consistency of the experimental data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is a general mathematical procedure which allows for the verification of the impedance data , i.e. , they constitute conditions for `` good '' impedances that , in this manner , satisfy the criteria of linearity , causality , stability , and finiteness  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to interpret eis experimental data from a theoretical perspective , in addition to the models based on equivalent circuits , the small - signal poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) diffusion model is particularly important . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> when one utilizes it to analyze immittance data , preferably using full complex nonlinear least squares ( cnls ) fitting , as in the levmw computer program  @xcite , it can lead to estimates of many more physically relevant electrical parameters than can any other available eis model . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of any relevant theoretical model and , in particular , pnp or pnp modified models , has to be accompanied by checking their validity in the terms required by the kk relations .    in this letter , </S>",
    "<S> a set of recently proposed pnp models that are successful in interpreting the experimental eis data @xcite is considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that they also obey the kk relations if these relations are slightly modified . </S>",
    "<S> these pnp models satisfy poisson s equation in a finite length sample , e.g. , a cell of thickness @xmath1 with flat electrodes of area @xmath2 placed at the positions @xmath3 of a cartesian reference system . for simplicity s sake , the analysis is limited to the case of full dissociation , of mobile charges with equal mobilities , in the presence of an electric field , of electrical potential @xmath4 , due to the action of an external power supply or to a charge separation . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the bulk densities , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for positive @xmath9 and negative @xmath10 ions , respectively , are obtained by solving the standard form of the continuity equations , written as    @xmath11    in which the densities of currents are defined as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the electrical charge of the ions , @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath15 the absolute temperature . in addition , in thermodynamical equilibrium , the material contains a density of @xmath16 positive and @xmath16 negative ions , per unit volume , uniformly distributed across the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial profile of the electrical potential is governed by the poisson s equation , in the form :    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the dielectric coefficient of the medium .    </S>",
    "<S> this problem has been faced in the past  @xcite and more recently  @xcite for some significant boundary conditions and the details of the calculations for all these cases will be omitted here to save space . in the case of blocking electrodes , for which @xmath19 the electrical impedance is given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the frequency of the applied voltage ,    @xmath22    and @xmath23 is the debye s screening length , and @xmath24 is the diffusion coefficient assumed as the same for positive and negative ions .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem was also recently extended by assuming that the continuity equation contains a superposition of normal and fractional diffusion , the latter being characterized by a fractional coefficient @xmath25 , in the form :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is dimensionless , while the dimension of @xmath28 is @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the electrical impedance obtained in this case is  @xcite    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    a further generalization of the problem was achieved by considering fractional time diffusion equations of distributed orders  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these equations may be formally written , for example , as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a distribution function of @xmath34 and the fractional operator considered is the caputo one  @xcite , which can be defined as    @xmath35    with @xmath36 and @xmath37 representing the @xmath38 derivative with respect to @xmath39 . as a particular case , </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to take the limit @xmath40 when one aims at studying the response of the system to a periodic applied potential as is done here  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) has the presence of fractional time operator of distributed order which , depending on the choice of @xmath33 , can account for different diffusive regimes of the ions in the system , as will be discussed later . </S>",
    "<S> the order of these derivatives are consequently distributed according to the function @xmath33 , that works as the weight factor for each regime ( order ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the general expression for the impedance is given by  @xcite    @xmath41    where , now ,    @xmath42    with @xmath43 the presence of @xmath44 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 131 ] ) and  ( [ beta ] ) is responsible for the incorporation of an arbitrary number of diffusive regimes to the description of the diffusion of ions through the sample . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is noteworthy that the general expression for the impedance , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 131 ] ) , has exactly the same functional form of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mamma1 ] ) and  ( [ mamma2 ] ) , which , in turn , can be hereafter faced as its particular cases .    finally , to go one step further in the generalization process </S>",
    "<S> , one can consider again the fractional diffusion of distributed order governing the bulk behavior , but now subjected to the boundary conditions  @xcite    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and the right - hand term can be related to an adsorption - desorption process . in fact , for the specific choice of @xmath47 , we recover the adsorption - desorption processes at the surfaces governed by a kinetic equation that corresponds to the langmuir approximation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> others choices of @xmath48 can be performed to incorporate memory effects and , consequently , non - debye relaxation processes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the impedance of the cell is    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , the presence of the kernel @xmath48 in  ( [ impedance1 ] ) gives to the electrical impedance a very general profile . </S>",
    "<S> this feature can be illustrated for two representative cases , among others . </S>",
    "<S> when one considers that @xmath54 , with @xmath47 , the case worked out in  @xcite , in which adsorption  desorption phenomena are incorporated to the analysis by means of a kinetic balance equation at the surfaces , is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , when @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , the usual form of the electrical impedance obtained in the situation of blocking electrodes is reobtained . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the possible choices of the kernel allow one to handle different expressions for the electrical impedance , suitable to face a large variety of experimental situations .    in all the cases mentioned before , </S>",
    "<S> the system is governed by linear differential equations , of usual or fractional derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we expect that for the real ( @xmath57 ) and imaginary ( @xmath58 ) parts of @xmath59 hold the kk relations . </S>",
    "<S> this is actually the case , as we can show by means of the simple calculation below . </S>",
    "<S> notice , however , that these relations differ from those reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 21 ) and ( 23 ) , because the impedance diverges for @xmath60 . to obtain the modified form of the kk relations </S>",
    "<S> , we have just to consider the analytic function , in the upper - half part of the complex plane    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is a path in the complex plane , and @xmath63 denotes the principal value of the integral , on the real axis . the third contribution on the lhs , </S>",
    "<S> i.e.    @xmath64    is necessary because @xmath65 diverges for @xmath66 . since @xmath59 is analytic in @xmath67 , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2 ] ) we get    @xmath68    considering that @xmath69 , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) , we obtain the kk relations as    @xmath70    where    @xmath71    for @xmath72 , we have    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is a finite quantity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the kk relations for the class of problems we are considering are    @xmath75    which can be conveniently rewritten , respectively , as    @xmath76    we are now ready to apply this formalism to the electrical impedance expressions presented before .    </S>",
    "<S> consider first eq .  ( [ 131 ] ) , whose low frequency limit is given by the expression    @xmath77\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and , consequently ,    @xmath78    because , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ efao ] ) , it follows that @xmath79 , for @xmath80 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) , and imaginary , @xmath81 ( b ) , parts of the impedance versus the frequency for @xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the black solid line corresponds to the exact case and the dashed red line is the asymptotic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the curves have been drawn for the following values of the parameters relative to a liquid - crystalline system : @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92  @xcite , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( a ) , and imaginary , @xmath81 ( b ) , parts of the impedance versus the frequency for @xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the black solid line corresponds to the exact case and the dashed red line is the asymptotic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the curves have been drawn for the following values of the parameters relative to a liquid - crystalline system : @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92  @xcite , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this quantity coincides with the inverse of the total capacitance of the sample , in the dc limit . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it coincides with the inverse of the resulting series capacitance of two equal capacitances @xmath96 , that can be identify with the capacitance of the surface layer , i.e. , the gouy - chapman double layer capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> it is then clear that the entire class of expressions of the kind considered in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 131 ] ) , for which @xmath97 , obeys the modified kk relations and , as expected , are good candidates as theoretical tools for interpreting eis experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ impedance1 ] ) , for the case characterized by @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath98 , which , as mentioned before , represents , in the frequency domain , the usual kinetic equation connected with adsorption - desorption phenomenon ( langmuir s approximation ) in the time domain . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to show that the low frequency limit of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ impedance1 ] ) is given by    @xmath99\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which , by means of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 8 ] ) , allows one to obtain    @xmath100    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ figure1 ] ) , the exact results , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 131 ] ) and  ( [ impedance1 ] ) , and the approximated ones , i.e. , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ approx1 ] ) and  ( [ approx2 ] ) , are illustrated for the cases discussed above in order to compare their low frequency behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that similarly to the previous result obtained , i.e. , for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 8 - 1 ] ) , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) is also connected with the inverse of the total capacitance of the sample , but now taking into account the influence of the adsorption process occurring at the surfaces of the electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the case in which the adsorption process is present , the effective thickness intervening in the capacitance of the double - layer is the sum of the debye s screening length with the quantity @xmath101 , which has dimensions of length . in a phenomenological perspective , it represents an effective thickness of the layer over which the adsorption  desorption phenomenon takes place near the interface . again </S>",
    "<S> , the kk relations are obeyed by the general expression , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ impedance1 ] ) for a large class of choices for @xmath102 that remains finite in the low frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> these choices have their counterparts in the time  domain which , in general , is more helpful to interpret the phenomena occurring near the interface in terms of boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is remarkable illustrated in the particular case analyzed above ( langmuir s approxi- mation ) . in this example , the emergence of an adsorbing layer was automatically incorporated to the resulting double - layer capacitance , renormalizing it and allowing for a simple interpretation of the phenomenological parameters entering the kinetic equation . </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding , even if obtained for a particular case , this noticeable result permits one to expect that the resulting effects of other significant phenomena , occurring near to the electrodes , could be incorporated to the description of the global properties of the electrolytic cell in the pnp or pnpa models .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of the frequency response of a class of electrochemical impedance expressions , obtained in the ambit of usual or anomalous ( pnp or pnpa ) models , as well as some of their generalizations that takes into account different types of boundary conditions , have been theoretically analysed . </S>",
    "<S> the slightly modified expressions of the kk relations presented here , and obeyed by these expressions , can be also used to verify the correctness of the impedance date obtained by means of the eis technique in the field of electro - chemistry and condensed matter physics . </S>"
