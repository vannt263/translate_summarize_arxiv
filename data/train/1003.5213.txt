    "the half - wave plates are set such that an equal proportion of an output mode is incident on each photon detector for that mode .",
    "the layout of the single - photon detectors is asymmetric for logistical reasons .",
    "@xmath3-photon states ( @xmath65 ) are signaled by coincident detection of @xmath66 photons across the detectors , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent the number of photons detected in the respective output modes . with 5 detectors in each of the two output arms of the interferometer",
    ", there are a total of @xmath69 possible coincidence detection patterns that describe an @xmath3-photon output state  for 4-photon states",
    "this gives 210 patterns .",
    "the projection probability , that is , the probability that a particular photon output state @xmath70 will be successfully resolved , depends on @xmath67 and @xmath68 even if the individual detectors are unit - efficiency ( but not photon - number resolving ) photodetectors .",
    "for example , in this unit - efficiency case the 4-photon @xmath25 state has a projection probability of 0.64 with this detection scheme , whereas the @xmath71 state has a projection probability of only 0.096 .",
    "like many other experiments , we do not consider loss in our calculation of resources @xmath2 .",
    "however , we require that the probability of projection is independent of the particular output state of the interferometer .    in addition , a technical limitation means that we can only consider a maximum of 128 patterns at once .",
    "for these reasons , we consider only a limited set of patterns , randomly chosen for each measurement result , such that the ultimate probability of detection for each result is approximately independent of the state .",
    "we use as many patterns as we can up to the limit of our electronics . to address the remaining discrepancy ,",
    "we randomly discard a certain small proportion of measurement results in software , before the result can be used in the algorithm .",
    "this is equivalent to introducing a controlled state - dependent loss .",
    "we emphasize that this solution is a consequence of the imperfect number detection mechanism we use , necessary to simulate perfect detectors , and is not fundamental to our approach .",

    "the fisher information places a lower bound on the smallest possible _ shift _ @xmath77 in the phase away from @xmath15 that can be reliably detected from a large number @xmath78 of repeated measurements , via the cramr - rao inequality , @xmath79 this motivates defining the fisher length as @xmath80 . for ideal measurements on an @xmath2-photon noon state",
    "the fisher information is @xmath81 and fisher length is @xmath6 , independent of the system phase .",
    "thus the fisher information for a 4-photon noon state , for example , is @xmath82 .",
    "it is additive for independent measurements on two separate states , so the fisher information for two 2-photon noon states is @xmath83 , half that for a single 4-photon noon state .",
    "for the 4-photon states that we generate , the fisher information is less than that of a 4-photon noon state , and is equal to @xmath84 for ideal measurements . with the experimental detection probability matrix @xmath85 given in eq .",
    "[ eq : exptchar ] for our 4-photon input state @xmath22 , the maximum fisher information is @xmath86 .",
    "this is above the value of @xmath83 for two independent 2-photon ideal noon states , and well above the value for two 2-photon noon states with our experimentally measured visibilities , which is at most @xmath87 .    with the experimental @xmath85 matrix ,",
    "the fisher information is no longer independent of @xmath15 , and has the dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fisher ] . with the addition of the controllable phase @xmath16 ,",
    "the fisher information is a function of @xmath88 .",
    "the sensitive dependence on the system phase is likely to be the reason why it is often optimal to perform the 4-photon measurements last  the system phase must already be known quite accurately in order to adjust the feedback phase to maximise the fisher information ."
