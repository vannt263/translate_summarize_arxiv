    "the doppler effect is a fundamental aspect of wave phenomena important in almost all areas of physics .",
    "the effect can be experienced in everyday life from fast moving cars or trains passing by and is also used as a practical method for measuring the velocity of objects such as baseballs and automobiles .",
    "it is also of crucial importance in astrophysics , where the receding or approaching velocity of an object is determined using the doppler effect in light .",
    "the results are used as a basis for such fundamental aspects as hubble s law and the existence of black holes .",
    "we believe that the doppler effect , given its importance and practicality , is a quite suitable theme as a basic physics experiment for all types of students .    in this work , we explain concretely experiments for quantitatively measuring the doppler effect due to the motion of the wave source with gravitational acceleration . our purpose is to design experiments for undergraduate students including non - science majors . as such",
    ", we need an experiment that can be easily set up and safely conducted in an ordinary laboratory situation .",
    "further , data acquisition needs to be robust and not sensitive to the environment .",
    "the students should be able to clearly understand what is going on and the results should be quantitative .",
    "since we have a wide variety of students in mind , the analysis should not necessitate `` higher '' mathematics and desirably , the setup should use inexpensive components which are readily available .",
    "as explained below , we have been able to achieve all these goals .",
    "since practical considerations are of import , we provide the details of the experiment , such as the parameters and the equipment used . due to its significance as a fundamental physics phenomenon , various forms of doppler effect experiments have been proposed and conducted for some time : doppler effect due to a wave source on a toy car@xcite , on an air track@xcite , in circular motion@xcite , carried by a student@xcite and in free fall@xcite as well as the effect due to the motion of the receiver@xcite have been studied .",
    "demonstrations of doppler effects from real cars have also been performed@xcite . however , the majority of the past experiments seem either rather difficult to conduct , use ultrasonic frequencies , not quantitative or require specialized equipment or circuitry .",
    "we explain the basic principle and the setup of the experiments in .",
    "section [ sec : freefall ] contains the details and the results from doppler effect measurements of a freely falling source .",
    "we analyze the properties of doppler effects from accelerating sources in . in the process , we clarify some non - trivial conditions and limitations in measuring doppler effects .",
    "we explain the doppler effect measurements of a pendulum source in .",
    "in this work , we directly measure the doppler shift due to the motion of the source , since this approach is most often used in various areas of fundamental physics and in practical measurements .",
    "the principle of the experiments is to measure the velocity of a moving wave source using the doppler effect relation , @xmath0 .",
    "the measured frequency is @xmath1 when the source is stationary and @xmath2 when it is approaching the observer with velocity @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the speed of sound . from the time dependence of @xmath3",
    ", we can obtain the acceleration . while this principle can indeed be made to work",
    ", the simplicity is somewhat deceptive , even in principle . to measure a frequency at any given instant , a finite amount of time @xmath5",
    "is necessary and the instantaneous velocity picture ceases to hold for large accelerations or for long measurement times , as explained in .",
    "( @xmath5 is different from the time of observation , @xmath6 , during which we make multiple measurements of the frequency . )",
    "while the idea is simple , one main obstacle is that @xmath3 is at most few% of @xmath7 , due to practical considerations , including safety .",
    "consequently , to measure @xmath3 to 10% accuracy , for instance , we need 0.1% level accuracy in the measurement of @xmath2 , which is not trivial . a theoretical limitation exists that to obtain a frequency resolution @xmath8 , time @xmath9 is necessary for the measurement . to obtain the desired precision",
    ", we use a relatively high frequency sound @xmath10khz and require @xmath11hz .",
    "consequently , the amount of time required for the measurement is @xmath12s .",
    "a free fall from the height of 2 m takes @xmath13s , for instance , which is not that much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "increasing @xmath5 to decrease @xmath8 can conflict with measuring doppler effects from accelerating sources , as explained in .",
    "@xmath14 so that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the sampling rate and @xmath17 is the number of samples .",
    "any @xmath16 can be used as long as @xmath16 is higher than twice the frequency of interest .",
    "@xmath17 is chosen appropriately depending on the situation at hand .",
    "since @xmath8 is fixed by @xmath5 , larger @xmath1 can achieve higher relative accuracy .",
    "for the clarity of exposition to students and since generic components we utilize are not guaranteed to function properly outside the audible range , we use an audible sound source .",
    "all the experiments below were conducted with @xmath18khz , a clearly audible sound while not being too unpleasant .    in the experiments ,",
    "we need a simple way to measure frequencies in a short period of time with adequate accuracy . for this",
    "we use a microphone attached to a personal computer ( pc ) and a spectrum analyzer software .",
    "while most microphones work , one with high directivity facilitates the experiment . for spectral analysis",
    ", we used the gnu octave software@xcite and an explicit example script for extracting spectra from a sound file is provided in appendix  [ sec : octave ] .",
    "an important technical point is to find an object that emits a sound at a distinct frequency steadily and a digital voice recorder is suitable for this task .",
    "it has the additional advantage that the sound can be synthesized on a pc , transferred to it , then played back .",
    "synthesizing such a sound file can be accomplished by using gnu octave@xcite or sox@xcite , for instance .",
    "a generic recorder with sufficient sound volume can perform the task and a means to directly transfer the sound from a pc is convenient .",
    "we also tested various simple buzzers for this purpose , but none of those tested could emit a sound with a steady enough frequency , especially when in motion . instead of a digital voice recorder , in some cases , a speaker attached to the same pc can be used to replay the synthesized sound , which can be somewhat cheaper .",
    "however , in this case , enough volume needs to be attainable and we need to use a software that does not emit the sound as it is recording , since it will otherwise interfere .",
    "having an independent playback device such as a digital recorder , we find , is versatile , convenient and facilitates the experiment .",
    "the components we used are an inexpensive pc , eee  pc ( asus , @xmath19 ) , the microphone audio technica at815b ( @xmath20 ) and the voice recorder , olympus ds-51 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "all these components are generic and , in our experience , other similar components also suffice .",
    "is arbitrary and hann window is used .",
    ", width=283 ]    in this experiment , we let a sound source fall freely towards a microphone and measure the time dependence of the frequency .",
    "the experiment is similar in spirit to some previous experiments@xcite , though more quantitative . to obtain the experimental results ,",
    "we start recording on the pc and let the voice recorder drop ( attached to a line to avoid it dropping all the way ) . the spectrum is analyzed at every @xmath22 and the peak frequencies are obtained .",
    "example spectra from a stationary and a freely falling source approaching the observer are shown in . here",
    ", we used @xmath23khz taking into consideration the constraints of .",
    "consequently , @xmath24hz with an error @xmath25 m/s in @xmath3 .",
    "an example of the time dependence of @xmath2 is shown in  ( left ) , where we can see the doppler effect from a source falling repeatedly , after being pulled back up by the line .",
