    "inelastic electron scattering has proven to be a very precise tool for studying the excitation spectrum of atomic nuclei owing to the possibility of simultaneously varying energy and momentum transfer ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . in a representation of the nuclear response as a function of @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 a large broad peak occurs at about @xmath5 .",
    "its position corresponds to the elastic peak in electron scattering by a free nucleon .",
    "it is quite natural to assume that a quasifree process is reponsible for such a peak with a nucleon emitted quasielastically .",
    "coincidence ( @xmath1 ) experiments in the quasifree region confirm such a picture and represent a valuable source of information on single - nucleon degrees of freedom inside nuclei .    in the inclusive ( @xmath0 ) process only the scattered electron is detected and the final nuclear state is undetermined , but the main contribution in the region of the quasielastic ( qe ) peak comes from the interaction on single nucleons .",
    "if the nucleons were indeed free , the peak would be sharp and would just occur at the energy loss @xmath5 corresponding to the energy taken by the recoiling free nucleon .",
    "a shift in the position of the peak is produced by the nuclear binding , while a broadening of the peak is produced by fermi motion .",
    "a very simple model , where the cross section is given by the interaction on all the constituent nucleons of the nucleus and a fermi gas model is assumed for nuclear structure , is indeed able to give a remarkably good description of the cross section in the qe region @xcite .",
    "this same model , however , is not able to describe simultaneously the qe longitudinal and transverse responses , whose rosenbluth separation has been experimentally achieved on a variety of nuclei and over a large range of momentum transfers @xcite .    in the one - photon exchange approximation and",
    "assuming the plane - wave approximation for the incident and the outgoing electrons , the ( @xmath0 ) cross section is given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a kinematical factor and @xmath8 measures the polarization of the virtual photon . in eq .",
    "( [ eq.polar ] ) @xmath9 is the scattering angle of the electron , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the four momentum transfer .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse response functions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined by @xmath14 in terms of the diagonal components of the hadron tensor @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the nuclear charge - current operator which connects the initial state @xmath17 of the nucleus , of energy @xmath18 , with the final states @xmath19 , of energy @xmath20 . in the inclusive ( @xmath0 ) process the sum is over a complete set of final nuclear states and only the diagonal components of the hadron tensor contribute , while in the exclusive ( @xmath1 ) process also the nondiagonal components contribute and the cross section is in general given in terms of a larger number of structure functions @xcite .",
    "the separation of the response functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 can experimentally by achieved from eq .",

    ", the slope gives @xmath12 and the extrapolated intercept with the vertical axis at @xmath23 gives @xmath13 .",
    "such a rosenbluth separation @xcite has been achieved in the 80 s and 90 s on different nuclei @xcite .",
    "a huge amount of theoretical work was produced over the past two decades in order to explain the problem raised by the experimental separation of @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the main problem was the apparent quenching of @xmath12 , while for @xmath13 there is in general an apparent excess of strength .",
    "different approaches , with different theoretical ingredients , obtained partial success in explaining either the longitudinal or the transverse response , but despite all these efforts some problems are still open and a consistent and simultaneous description of @xmath12 and @xmath13 data has not been achieved .",
    "some confusion is also due to the experimental situation .",
    "these experiments of separation are difficult and data from different laboratories are sometimes in disagreement .",
    "new experiments with improved experimental accuracy would be helpful to make the experimental situation clearer .",
    "new measurements are planned at jlab @xcite    in this contribution we present a green s function approach to the inclusive qe ( @xmath0 ) scattering . with our work",
    "we do nt aim at a unified and consistent description of @xmath12 and @xmath13 data .",
    "the model contains approximations .",
    "it is basically a single - particle approach , where only the one - body part of the nuclear current is retained .",
    "calculations of two - body contributions performed by different groups have given different results @xcite .",
    "there are , however , consistent indications that the combined effect of two - body current and tensor correlations can be appreciable on the transverse response @xcite .",
    "thus , with our model we do nt expect to describe @xmath13 data , while the main contributions to @xmath12 should already be included .",
    "our aim is to study the effects of final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "fsi are an important ingredient of the inclusive electron scattering , since they are essential to explain the exclusive one - nucleon emission , which gives the main contribution to the inclusive reaction in the qe region .",
    "the absorption in a given final state due , e.g. , to the imaginary part of the optical potential , produces a loss of flux that is appropriate for the exclusive process , but inconsistent for the inclusive one , where all the allowed final channels contribute and the total flux must be conserved .",
    "this conservation is preserved in the green s function approach , where the components of the nuclear response are written in terms of the single - particle optical model green s function .",
    "this result was originally derived by arguments based on the multiple scattering theory @xcite and successively by means of the feshbach projection operator formalism @xcite .",
    "the spectral representation of the single - particle green s function , based on a biorthogonal expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian optical potential , allows one to perform explicit calculations and to treat fsi consistently in the inclusive and in the exclusive reactions .",
    "important and peculiar effects are given , in the inclusive reactions , by the imaginary part of the optical potential , which is responsible for the redistribution of the strength among different channels .",
    "the approach has been developed and used in a nonrelativistic frame @xcite and , more recently , also in a relativistic frame @xcite .",
    "although some differences and complications are due to the dirac matrix structure , the formalism follows in both frames the same steps and approximations .",
    "the numerical results obtained in both frames allow us to check the relevance of relativistic effects .",

    "it must be performed after calculating the matrix elements between normalizable states .",
    "the hadronic tensor in eq .",

    "only an approximated treatment reduces the problem to a tractable form . under suitable approximations the nuclear response can be written in terms of the optical - model green s function @xcite .",
    "the first approximation consists in retaining only the one - body part of the charge - current operator @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we set @xmath31 where @xmath32 acts only on the variables of the nucleon @xmath33 . by eq.([eq.1bcurrent ] ) , one can express the hadron tensor as the sum of two terms , i.e. , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the incoherent hadron tensor @xcite , which contains only the diagonal contributions @xmath36 , whereas the coherent hadron tensor @xmath37 gathers the residual terms of interference between different nucleons .",
    "as the incoherent hadron tensor , also @xmath37 can be expressed in terms of single - particle quantities ( see sect . 9 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but for the transferred momenta considered here we can take advantage of the high-@xmath4 approximation @xcite and retain only @xmath35 .",
    "this term can be further simplified using the symmetry of @xmath29 for the exchange of nucleons and the antisymmetrization of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the component of @xmath40 related to an arbitrarily selected nucleon .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the eigenvectors of the residual hamiltonian @xmath43 of a interacting nucleons related to the discrete and continuous eigenvalues @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",

    "( [ eq.directterm ] ) , the matrix elements of @xmath61 in the basis @xmath62 define the single - particle green s function @xmath63 @xcite of the single - particle feshbach optical potential @xmath64 @xcite @xmath65 which describes the elastic scattering of a nucleon by an a - nucleus in the discrete state @xmath52 .",
    "using the definition of @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.pro ] ) , the direct hadron tensor @xmath67 of eq .",
    "( [ eq.directterm ] ) can be reduced to the single - particle expression @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the spectral strength @xcite of the hole state @xmath70 , which is the normalized overlap integral between @xmath71 and @xmath52 .",
    "the problem of expressing the interference hadron tensor @xmath72 in a one - body form is treated in ref .",
    "it is argued that the contribution of @xmath72 can be included into the direct hadron tensor @xmath73 by the simple replacement @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the energy derivative of the feshbach optical potential .    in principle ,",
    "different optical potentials @xmath76 must be considered for different values of @xmath47 . as neither microscopic nor empirical calculations are available for the optical potential @xmath76 associated with the excited states , a common practice relates them to the ground state potential @xmath77 by means of an appropriate energy shift .",
    "therefore we set @xmath78 which implies @xmath79 using these approximations , we write @xmath80    as a next step , the spectral representation of the single - particle green s function function can be used in order to allow practical calculations of the hadron tensor of eq .",

    "due to the complex nature of @xmath84 the spectral representation of @xmath85 involves a biorthogonal expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of @xmath84 and of its hermitian conjugate @xmath86 .",
    "we consider the incoming wave scattering solutions of the eigenvalue equations , i.e. , @xmath87 the choice of incoming wave solutions is not strictly necessary , but it is convenient in order to have a closer comparison with the treatment of the exclusive ( @xmath1 ) reactions , where the final states fulfill this asymptotic condition and are the eigenfunctions @xmath88 of @xmath86 .",

    "the attenuation of its strength , mathematically due to the imaginary part of @xmath101 , is related to the flux lost towards the channels different from @xmath47 . in the inclusive response",
