    "networks of quantum mechanical particles play a fundamental role in extending quantum information processing to multipartite settings and in foreseeing the realization of distributed protocols for multi - users devices @xcite .    in the present work we study",
    "manipulation of entanglement between quantum networks and attempt to isolate useful graph - theoretic properties in relation to the dynamics of entanglement . specifically , we analyze the problem of entanglement transfer through networks and then we relate its setting to the fidelity problem associated with state transfer .",
    "our goal is to study entanglement concentration and purification , when the evolution of the system involves two networks of spin - half particles with @xmath0-type interaction .",
    "entanglement concentration ( and , more generally , purification ) is among the most relevant tasks in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is a process extracting strongly entangled pairs out of initially weakly entangled ones , only by mean of local operations and classical communication .",
    "most of the known protocols involve control - not operations . in a similar way , multipartite measurements and classical communication",
    "are used to propagate entanglement in certain type of quantum networks @xcite .",
    "entanglement concentration has also been obtained by exploiting the effects of quantum statistics of indistinguishable particles @xcite .",
    "a streaming ( sequential ) protocol for universal entanglement concentration has recently appeared in @xcite , where a number of input systems are processed in sequence , and perfect entangled pairs are obtained at the end of the protocol .",
    "following @xcite , we simply exploit free dynamics on the networks and local measurements on the sites .",
    "somehow contrarily to a claim proposed in @xcite , we show that this method works reasonably well also in the case of @xmath0-type interaction .",
    "we consider generic network topologies other than linear spin chains and we introduce an efficiency measure to characterize the performance of the protocol .",
    "it will turn out that , at least in the cases considered , the structure of the networks only affects the time at which the maximum efficiency is attained .",
    "the topic of this paper fits into a growing literature .",
    "state and energy transfer in spin systems are now areas of extensive study @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "protocols for creating entanglement between distant sites in a quantum network have been designed in @xcite , where the network considered is a lattices , whose vertices share pure , non - maximally entangled pairs of qubits .",
    "the problem of preparing maximally entangled states between different sites in a distributed quantum system is related to classical percolation in statistical mechanics @xcite . in @xcite , the study of entanglement percolation",
    "is extended to structures with precise statistical properties but unknown local topology . in @xcite , entanglement percolation",
    "is used for long - distance singlet generation in networks with adjacent vertices connected by partially entangled bipartite mixed states .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the considered networks model relying on the basic @xmath0-type interaction . in section iii , we give rigorous results for the problem of entanglement transfer in quantum networks by considering the single excitation model .",
    "the quality of the entanglement transmission is then related to the fidelity achieved between the considered nodes , therefore extending the cases studied in @xcite . in section iv",
    ", we discuss how to enhance the entanglement of a pure states through free dynamics and local measurements on the nodes .",
    "we introduce an efficiency measure for our protocols , by considering all possible measurement outcomes and the corresponding probabilities . finally ,",
    "in section v , we show how the protocol works in the case of mixed entangled states by considering werner mixtures @xcite .",
    "likewise section iv , the efficiency of the procedure will be related to the minimal number of initially entangled pairs necessary to successfully complete the protocol .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section vi , where we summarize the results and mention potential physical realizations .",

    "the particles are usually associated to the vertices of @xmath4 , while the edges of @xmath4 represent their allowed couplings .",
    "if one considers the @xmath0 interaction model , then @xmath11 means that the particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 interact by the hamiltonian @xmath14_{ij}=-\\left ( x_{i}x_{j}+y_{i}y_{j}\\right )   $ ] , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the pauli operators of the @xmath12-th particle ( here we consider unit negative coupling constant ) .",

    "we have shown how to increase the entanglement of pure and mixed states via free dynamics and local measurements on the nodes .",

    "the performance appears to be independent of the networks topology provided that there are no isolated nodes .",
    "the structure of the network only affects the time at which the maximum efficiency is attained .",
    "moreover , we have determined the minimal number of initial entangled pairs shared between the two networks and needed to successfully complete the protocol ( _ i.e. _ , with nonzero efficiency ) .",
    "this number is 1 and 3 for entanglement concentration and purification , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the results shown in figs . ( [ concentration ] ) and ( [ purification ] ) suggest that a ( quasi ) constant increase for the maxima of the efficiency is obtained with a corresponding increase for the number of entangled pairs . this can be estimated as about @xmath142 , for the case of entanglement concentration , and about @xmath143 , for the case of purification for each additional pair .",
    "this trend suggests that a ( quasi ) deterministic protocol can be achieved , at least for specific values of @xmath90 or @xmath144 , with a limited number of initially entangled pairs .",
    "our protocol is straightforward and only based on the free dynamics occurring in the two networks .",
    "it may be an interesting venue to consider more general settings , as , for example , synchronous dynamics in different networks .",
    "notice that already in the single excitation model the xyz ( heisenberg ) interaction would give a different networks dynamics .",
    "actually a phase factor would be introduced in front of the state s components containing one excitation per network .",
    "however such a phase factor is not influent to our protocol as long as we consider measurements on the computational basis ( z eigenvectors ) .",
    "thus our conclusions can be applied to xy model as well as to heisenberg model .",
    "finally , it is worth remarking that the proposed schemes for entanglement manipulation might be experimentally verified with networks containing few spins - half systems .",
    "candidate physical systems would be semiconductor quantum dots @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite or atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite .",
