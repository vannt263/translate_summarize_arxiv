    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) and mann - whitney u ( m - w ) tests shows that this trend is highly significant ( see tables  [ ks ] and  [ mw ] ) .",
    "note that the axis ratio distribution from vdw11 , due to their small sample size , is consistent with both the low- and high - z axis ratio distributions we analyze here .",
    "figure [ q_z_distribution ] summarizes the observed evolution in the mean projected shape of early type galaxies . beyond @xmath74",
    "we see a gradual decrease in the median axis ratio of early - type galaxies , which is the result of an increased fraction of galaxies with axis ratios smaller than 0.6 .",
    "the observed axis - ratio distributions imply that the intrinsic thickness of the typical early - type galaxy is no more than about 0.4 . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will quantify this intrinsic shape through detailed modeling .",
    "the observations presented here can now put on a firmer footing the claim by vdw11 that many high - redshift early - type galaxies display a disk - like structure and that , plausibly , these galaxies will grow into larger , intrinsically round galaxies through merging .",
    "the vdw11 sample had been too small to confirm or rule evolution at a fixed stellar mass , which is important in order to differentiate evolutionary paths that galaxies of a given mass take at different cosmic times . even at the present - day ,",
    "the typical early - type galaxy with a mass below @xmath75 is rather flattened ( vdw09 ) , which also corresponds to a disk - like kinematic structure ( rotation ) as shown by , for example , @xcite .",
    "here we show that such galaxies had yet thinner intrinsic shapes at @xmath6 .",
    "good correspondence between rotation of the stellar body and flattening has been confirmed up to @xmath74 by @xcite .",
    "although such confirmation is , so far , lacking at higher redshifts it is reasonable to assume that flattening implies rotation at all redshifts .",
    "we note that beyond the simple observation that early - type galaxies , here defined as galaxies with little star - formation activity , are on average flatter at @xmath6 than at lower redshifts , we can not distinguish between the different varieties of such galaxies  such as quiescent spirals , barred / ringed s0s , etc .  and their evolution .",
    "our results do not argue against a morphological transition that occurs along with the truncation of star formation , as argued by , for example , @xcite on the basis of the high srsic indices of quiescent galaxies : high - redshift early - type galaxies such as those studied here , despite the generally disk - like character inferred from their axis ratio distribution , are not pure disks and have higher srsic indices than star forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on bulge - disk decompositions , @xcite arrive at the conclusion that the early - type galaxy population at @xmath6 is mix of bulge- and disk - dominated galaxies , indicating that the transition from actively star - forming to quiescent need not always coincide with the formation of a dominant bulge . taken together , these observations are consistent with a picture in which gas had time to settle in a disk before star formation was truncated , and that this disk wholly or partially survived the process that truncated star formation .",
    "we measured the projected axis ratios from vlt / hawk - i @xmath0-band imaging of a sample of early - type galaxies in the redshift range @xmath5 selected by their low specific star formation rates .",
    "we find that at all redshifts @xmath76 the most massive galaxies @xmath9 are predominantly round .",
    "the lack of very massive , highly flattened galaxies suggests a universal ceiling mass for the formation of disks , independent of cosmic epoch . in order for galaxies to grow beyond this",
    "ceiling mass , separate evolutionary channel , presumably merging , has to be invoked .    in the full sample ( @xmath17 ) , we find , at all redshifts , a large range in projected axis ratios , reflecting a more disk - like structure .",
    "in addition , we find quantitative evidence that early - type galaxies at @xmath6 are more disk - like than their equally massive , present - day counterparts .",
    "therefore , for most early - type galaxies gas had time to settle into a disk before star formation ceased to produce a more passive galaxy .",
    "plausibly , such galaxies grow in mass over time , through mostly dissipationless merging and accretion of satellites , losing some of the angular momentum , and growing in size .",
