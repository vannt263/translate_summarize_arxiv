    "since the discovery of the superfluidity in helium four in 3d @xcite , a lot of question appeared around the existence of superfluidity in low dimensional systems .",
    "thenceforth and to date many experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have been realized to understand the dimensional and finite size effect on superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "although bec in three - dimensional infinite systems takes place at a well - defined critical temperature @xmath0 , for finite or semi - infinite systems the corresponding  transition \" extends over a finite range of temperatures , around @xmath0 which becomes only a reference temperature .",
    "an extensive study was carried out by pathria and collaborators @xcite who eventually proposed that the temperature at the maximum of the specific heat should be the critical temperature for a bose gas within a semi - infinite slab .    in this article",
    "we study the specific heat of an ideal bose gas within a semi - infinite periodic array of filaments .",
    "we want to give a detailed description only of the effects of the periodic structure over the bosons , so we are not taking into account any kind of interactions between particles .",
    "we calculate the specific heat as a function of the cross section size , the number , and the wall impenetrability ( or penetrability ) , of the filaments placed neatly as a bundle to form a cable .",
    "the occurrence of more than one maximum in the specific heat , leads us to reconsider pathria s  critical temperature \" for finite and semi - infinite system .",
    "we consider n non - interacting bosons confined in a periodic array of filaments with finite rectangular cross section and infinite length , set together to form a cable whose external wall is impenetrable .",
    "the filament structure is created by applying to the gas two set of dirac deltas mutually perpendiculars along the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions while the particles are free to move along the @xmath3 direction , i.e. , finite numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 of identical deltas , which are separated from each other a fixed distance @xmath6 @xmath7 , are applied in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions , respectively .",
    "thus , particles are confined in a box of impenetrable potential with dimensions : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the potential expression is @xmath11 where @xmath12 y @xmath13 are the intensities of the delta potential in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions , respectively .",

    "the energy is given by    @xmath18    with @xmath19 the wavenumber in the @xmath3 direction , @xmath20 due to the periodic boundary conditions in a box of length @xmath21 .",
    "the boundary conditions used in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , that is , the wave function vanishes at the walls of the tube .",
    "the energies of the particles in @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions are implicitly obtained from the equations @xcite @xmath24 with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 @xmath7 , @xmath27 is the number of delta potentials .",

    "the third system analyzed is a infinite periodic array of filaments of infinite length@xcite ( infinite number of filaments ) .",

    "the minimum , at larger temperature , is associated to particle trapping between two planes and appears at temperatures such that the thermal wavelength satisfies @xmath71 .",
    "the first maximum , from lower to higher temperature , reflects the preamble of the appearance of a bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the maximum at the largest temperature marks la return of the system to its 3d free ideal bose gas behavior .",

    "the existence of a bec is clear in the infinite system ( infinite number of filaments ) which is manifested by a peak at @xmath73 ( critical temperature of the system with infinite number of filaments ) , but for the system with 121 filaments we have a smoothed maximum or in other words , there is not a jump in the specific heat derivative , whose temperature no longer represents a critical point .     for different numbers of filaments of cross section @xmath74 and @xmath67 ( color figure online).,width=321 ]    fig .",

    "the maximum associated with the return to the 3d behavior coincide for three system .",
    "in conclusion , a detailed analysis of the isochoric specific heat of non - interacting bosons confined in semi - infinite multifilament cables was performed .",
    "we showed that the specific heat as a function of temperature has at least two maxima and one minimum .",
    "the first maximum , from lower to higher temperature , reflects the preamble of the appearance of a bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the temperature of this maximum is smaller as the cross section area or the wall impenetrability increases .",
    "the maximum at the largest temperature marks the return of the system to its 3d free ideal bose gas behavior .",
    "this maximum regularly appears when the wavelength of de broglie is @xmath76 .",
    "the minimum and/or plateau reflects the tendency of the system to behave in 1d .",
    "the minimum appears at temperatures such that @xmath77 becoming a plateau at lower temperatures for impenetrability such that @xmath78 .",
    "the temperature @xmath62 , at which the specific heat of a semi - infinite tube of square cross section @xmath52 is maximum , decreases monotonically as @xmath64 increases . as the cross section area approaches infinity @xmath79 as expected .",
    "the maxima present in the specific heat for a infinite system also appear in the semi - infinite system , but the maxima are moved towards higher temperatures due a finite size affect .",
    "however when we have an array greater than 11 @xmath80 11 filaments with @xmath81 the difference is only at the critical temperature .",
    "the main difference with respect to the infinite case @xcite is that the peak associated with the be condensation becomes a smoothed maximum or in other words , there is not a jump in the specific heat derivative , whose temperature no longer represents a critical point .",
