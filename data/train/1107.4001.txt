    "the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and finite density is a central topic in high energy physics . for small temperatures and densities the quark and gluon degrees of freedom",
    "are confined in hadrons .",
    "it is expected that there exists a region in the qcd phase diagram where quarks and gluons behave like a plasma ( deconfinement ) @xcite .",
    "the qcd lagrangian does not allow to directly calculate the confinement / deconfinement phase transition or the related chiral phase transition .",
    "the latter is mathematically well defined in the limit of zero quark masses , in which the qcd - lagrangian is invariant under chiral symmetry transformation and the chiral condensate is an exact order parameter @xcite .",
    "two effective models , the nambu jona - lasino model ( njl ) @xcite and the linear-@xmath0 model @xcite , have been often used to study the properties of the chiral phase transition .    beside these phenomenological approaches to qcd",
    "there is also the large-@xmath2 approximation @xcite .",
    "the number of color degrees of freedom in the qcd lagrangian is three , but a theory with an infinite large number of color degrees of freedom shows a behavior similar to the one of a theory with three colors . in the large-@xmath2",
    "limit the gauge symmetry of the qcd is changed from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . enlarging",
    "the number of colors also leads to a modified qcd coupling @xmath6 in a way that for @xmath7 the product @xmath8 remains constant .",
    "quarks and gluons are still present but gluons dominate the behavior of the theory",
    ". for low temperatures there still exists an confined phase , where the degrees of freedom are mesons and baryons @xcite . for high enough",
    "@xmath9 it is believed that the theory is deconfined .",
    "although also in the large-@xmath2 limit the theory is not solvable , it is significant simpler because only planar diagram survive .",
    "the linear-@xmath0 model @xcite , is an effective theory which is able to describe the mass splitting of the pions and the sigma via spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the model is built with terms which are invariant under chiral symmetry transformation . in the vacuum",
    "the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and the pions emerge as goldstone bosons . in the original form",
    "there is no explicit @xmath2 dependency . from former studies",
    "one knows that the quark - antiquark meson masses are independent of the number of colors , but the coupling of three mesons is suppressed by a factor of @xmath10 and the four mesons coupling by a factor of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these scaling properties can be implemented by redefining the meson four point interaction @xmath12 , while the parameter @xmath13 is not affected in the large-@xmath2 limit : @xmath14 .",
    "the lagrangian of the @xmath0-model as function of @xmath2 reads : @xmath15 where the scaler field @xmath0 and the pseudoscalar pion triplet @xmath16 are described by @xmath17 . for @xmath18",
    "the chiral condensate is @xmath19 .",
    "the only scale in the lagrangian is @xmath20 , to be identified with the pion decay constant .",
    "note that the chiral condensate scales with @xmath21 .",
    "the tree - level masses are not effected by the @xmath2-scaling and read @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the behavior at finite temperature can be analyzed using the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis ( cjt ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the gap equation for the chiral condensate is @xmath24 the full propagators @xmath25 and @xmath26 have the form : @xmath27 ^{-1 } \\text { .}%\\ ] ] the critical temperature @xmath1 is defined as the temperature where the condensate exactly vanishes @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to the following @xmath2 dependent scaling of the critical temperature : @xmath29 for the case @xmath30 obtains the known result @xmath31 , but it also clearly emerges that @xmath1 increases with @xmath2 .",
    "this means that for @xmath32 the chiral phase transition will not take place .",
    "the result is general for all hadronic models which do not include color degrees of freedom or temperature dependent parameters .",
    "this result , first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , contradicts the results found in the njl - model @xcite where the critical temperature @xmath33 remains constant in the large-@xmath2 limit , and with the fact that the related confinement / deconfinement phase transition is expected to be proportional to @xmath34 which is a large-@xmath2 independent quantity .",
    "in order to solve this discrepancy a phenomenological approach is proposed . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is argued that the @xmath35 scaling of order parameters is general .",
    "a phenomenological way to take this property into account is to make the parameter @xmath36 temperature dependent : @xmath37 the parameter @xmath38 is a new temperature scale and should be of the order of @xmath39 . the eq .",
    "( [ mod_mu ] ) modifies the gap equation ( [ sigma_gap ] ) and leads to a different critical temperature : @xmath40 the critical temperature is constant in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "now we turn back to the @xmath41 and study the case where the explicit symmetry breaking term @xmath42 is present .",
    "the complete lagrangian including a second temperature scale reads : @xmath43 all parameters are fixed via the masses and the pion decay constant ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 is set to a value of @xmath47 .",
    "the vacuum masses are chosen to be the following : the mass of the @xmath0-field is @xmath48 ( for the discussion of the value of the @xmath0 mass in the vacuum , see refs @xcite and refs therein ) , of the @xmath49-field is @xmath50 and the value for the pion decay constant is @xmath51 .    . above an critical temperature of @xmath52",
    "the masses become degenerated . ]    the finite temperature behavior for the masses , see fig .  1 , is similar to the one with no temperature dependent parameters .",
    "until the critical temperature @xmath1 is reached the temperature dependency of the pion mass an the @xmath0 mass varies slowly .",
    "close to @xmath1 the mass of the @xmath0 drops and slightly above @xmath1 the mass becomes degenerated with the pion mass . at high temperature both",
    "masses rise linearly .    .",
    "continuous line : @xmath53 and @xmath54 , dotted line : @xmath53 and @xmath55 , dashed line : @xmath56 and @xmath54 . ]    beside these similarities there are two remarkable properties that differ .",
    "first , the order of the phase transition is changed from a first order to a crossover phase transition .",
    "second , the critical temperature is lowered to @xmath57 .",
    "both phenomena can be seen in fig .  2 . ,",
    "where the case @xmath7 is shown : in this limit the chiral symmetry is restored through the new temperature scale @xmath38 and not via mesonic loops .",
    "in this work the mismatch between the njl - model and purely hadronic - models in the large-@xmath2 limit has been studied .",
    "we have found that the linear-@xmath0 model implies a scaling of @xmath1 which is at odd with the njl model and basic expectations @xcite .    in order to solve this issue",
    "we have introduced a phenomenologically motivated temperature dependent parameter . as a result",
    "the critical temperature remains constant in the large-@xmath2 limit .",
    "moreover , for @xmath30 the critical temperature is lowered to @xmath58 mev , a value which is in line with recent model and lattice results on the chiral phase transition .",
    "future studies should go beyond the simple phenomenological ansatz presented in this work and include , for instance , the coupling of hadrons to the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "preliminary results @xcite show that this approach also leads to the correct large-@xmath2 scaling of the critical temperature @xmath59 .",
