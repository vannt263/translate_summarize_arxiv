    "lattice boltzmann methods ( lbm ) are computational schemes for solving the macroscopic equations of fluid systems @xcite . in the case of binary mixtures",
    "they have been largely used to study the dynamics of systems described by the navier - stokes and convection - diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "the advantages of lbm compared with standard methods for partial differential equations are particularly relevant in problems involving complex boundaries such as multiphase flow in porous media @xcite .",
    "the large number of applications of lbm in studies on complex fluids @xcite , polymer mixtures @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite , etc . demonstrates the versatility of the method . in studies of spinodal decomposition of binary mixtures",
    "a version of lbm based on a free - energy approach , where the equilibrium distributions can be consistently chosen with the thermodynamics of the system , has been largely used @xcite .",
    "the stability properties of lbm are always crucial , especially in phase separation studies where long lasting simulations are needed to establish the growth properties .",
    "indeed , the average size of domains of the two phases generally grows with power law behavior and one wants to determine the exponent @xcite . however , previous studies showed the existence of a stability problem : total density fluctuations can suddenly grow in an uncontrolled way interrupting simulations and making problematic the determination of the growth exponent @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider new versions of lbm where the stability of the algorithm is improved .",
    "we have checked the stability properties by studying the problem of phase separation of two - dimensional binary mixtures .",
    "this is a severe test for stability since density fluctuations are enhanced by the presence of many interfaces in the system though they should be negligible in incompressible fluids .",
    "we find that , with the new algorithms , density fluctuations are largely suppressed and a more reliable determination of the growth exponent can be obtained",
    ".    the incompressible navier - stokes equation can be obtained from lattice boltzmann equations if density fluctuations are negligible @xcite .",
    "compressibility effects , intrinsic to lbm , can produce some serious errors in numerical simulations of incompressible fluids .",
    "due to these reasons",
    "improved versions of lbm have been introduced for the case of a simple fluid @xcite .",
    "new schemes are based on the explicit elimination in the equilibrium distributions of higher order terms in the mach number @xcite or on the introduction of a feedback mechanism @xcite . with these improvements",
    "it has been shown that analytical solutions known for particular flows are better reproduced than with old lbm versions .",
    "the above methods are here developed and introduced for the first time in the case of binary mixtures .",
    "the algorithms are presented in section ii . in section iii",
    "we study the problem of phase separation comparing the results obtained with different lbm versions .",
    "the role of boundary conditions on the problem of stability is examined in section iv .",
    "finally , in section v , we discuss our results and draw our conclusions .",

    "the term in @xmath1 gives rise to a positive background pressure .",
    "the terms in @xmath2 in the free - energy density @xmath3 correspond to the usual ginzburg - landau expression typically used in coarse - grained models of phase separation @xcite .",
    "the polynomial terms relate to the bulk properties of the fluid .",
    "while the parameter @xmath4 is always positive , @xmath5 allows to distinguish between a disordered ( @xmath6 ) and a segregated mixture ( @xmath7 ) where two pure phases with @xmath8 coexist",
    ". we will consider quenches into the coexistence region with @xmath7 and @xmath9 so that the equilibrium values for the order parameter are @xmath10 .",
    "the gradient term is related to the surface tension .",

    "the thermodynamic pressure tensor @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where the chemical part is @xmath14 .    the lattice boltzmann model is defined on the two - dimensional square lattice with the following nine velocity vectors : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , \\sin [ ( i-1)\\pi/2 ] ) c$ ] , @xmath17 , @xmath18,\\sin[(i-5)\\pi/2+\\pi/4 ] ) \\sqrt{2 } c$ ] , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the lattice constant and the time step , respectively .",

    "the distribution functions are related to the total density @xmath1 , to the fluid momentum @xmath28 and to the density difference @xmath2 through @xmath29 these quantities are locally conserved in any collision process and , therefore , we require that the local equilibrium distribution functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 fulfill the eqs .  ( [ phys ] ) .",

    "@xcite , using a chapman - enskog expansion @xcite , that the above described lattice boltzmann scheme simulates at second order in @xmath22 the continuity equation @xmath49 and the navier - stokes equation @xmath50 where the isotropic pressure contribution is @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 being the speed of sound and the kinematic viscosity , respectively . the first line of eq .",
    "( [ ns0 ] ) corresponds to the standard navier - stokes equation .",
    "the second line contains spurious terms .",
    "nonetheless , these terms , being gradient terms with higher order derivatives , are negligible compared to the ones in the first line when all hydrodynamic fields vary smoothly on the lattice scale @xcite .",
    "moreover , a convection - diffusion equation is also recovered : @xmath54 where the macroscopic mobility is @xmath55 .",
    "as before , the spurious terms in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ conv0 ] ) are also expected to be small .",
    "if the density fluctuations are negligible , the continuity and navier - stokes equations ( [ cont0])-([ns0 ] ) describe the behavior of an incompressible fluid . however , this is not always the case in lbm where the compressibility effects can produce errors in numerical simulations . in the next two subsections",
    "we will modify the described lbm in order to reduce unphysical compressibility effects .",
    "the first scheme that we consider and adapt to our lbm is the one introduced in ref .",
    "previous studies for incompressible fluids have shown that the density fluctuations , @xmath56 , are expected to be of order @xmath57 in the limit @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the mach number @xcite .",
    "we enforce this condition in the method . by substituting @xmath60 into the equilibrium distribution functions ( [ svil1 ] ) , @xmath61 being the specified constant value of density , and neglecting the terms proportional to @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , which are of the order @xmath64 or higher , we find that the net effect is to replace @xmath1 with @xmath61 into the expansion coefficients ( [ bs])-([ds ] ) keeping unchanged the rest of the scheme . in this way the terms in the equilibrium distribution functions ( [ svil1 ] ) are of the order @xmath57 or lower . the condition @xmath65 is satisfied in our runs where it is always @xmath66 .    in this case",
    "the chapman - enskog expansion gives the continuity equation @xmath67 the incompressible navier - stokes equation @xmath68 and the convection - diffusion equation @xmath69 where we have not written again the spurious terms of eqs .",
    "( [ ns0])-([conv0 ] ) .      in ref .",
    "@xcite a different algorithm based on a feedback mechanism is proposed to keep the density nearly constant in lbm for a single fluid . here",
    "we adapt this scheme to our model combining it with the one previously described .",
    "we use for the expansion coefficients ( [ as ] ) the following form : @xmath70 let us note that these expressions coincide with ( [ as ] ) when @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "here we only ask that @xmath73 to guarantee the total density conservation .",
    "we consider at each node and at each time step before collision the density @xmath1 fixing the value of @xmath74 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath4 is a positive constant given by experience . in this paper",
    "we generally use @xmath77 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is flexible , but if it is too large the simulation will be unstable .",
    "the value of @xmath78 follows from the relation between @xmath78 and @xmath74 .",
    "these values are then used in ( [ newa0 ] ) .",
    "this choice forces , in the next streaming step , more ( less ) particles to leave the node with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , resulting in @xmath81 .    by using a chapman - enskog expansion and neglecting terms of order @xmath64 or higher",
    "we find the continuity equation ( [ cont1 ] ) , the incompressible navier - stokes equation ( [ ns1 ] ) where now the isotropic pressure contribution is @xmath82 and the convection - diffusion equation ( [ conv1 ] ) . for the convenience of description , we label the old scheme as a , the scheme described in subsection b as b , the scheme combining scheme b and the feedback mechanism as c.",
    "after a binary mixture is quenched into the coexistence region and domains of the two phases are well established , the typical size of domains generally grows as @xmath83 .",
    "a simple scaling analysis of the navier - stokes and of the convection - diffusion equations shows that three regimes can be found depending on the role played by hydrodynamic degrees of freedom . at high viscosity",
    "the domain growth is governed by a diffusive mechanism and @xmath84 @xcite . when hydrodynamics becomes relevant , the laws @xmath85 or @xmath86 are expected depending on whether viscous forces or inertial effects dominate , respectively @xcite . however , in real systems the situation is more complex .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for viscous growth is not operating in the two - dimensional case @xcite and , indeed , this regime has never been observed in simulations @xcite . in this paper , since we address the question of stability which becomes more critical at low viscosities , we will focus on cases corresponding to the inertial regime .",
    "the average size of domains @xmath87 can be calculated as the first momentum of the structure factor , that is @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the average over different histories .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the behavior of @xmath87 for the sets of parameters listed in table i. similar behaviors have been also observed in many other cases here not reported .",
    "we have also not reported the worst situations occurring at very low @xmath26 , when the scheme a gets very soon unstable ( @xmath91 ) and the new schemes are not significantly better .",
    "all the cases of table i refer to situations where phase separation has already generated well - formed macroscopic domains and a significant evolution of @xmath87 can be observed . for each set ,",
    "results obtained with the schemes a , b and c are compared . while the scheme a can be used only before density fluctuations start to grow indefinitely , the simulations with the new schemes remain stable at all times for most of the cases considered .",
    "we have found only few cases ( e.g. , set 6 at the lowest considered viscosity in table i ) where the schemes b and c are affected by instability ; however , the instability with the scheme c occurs when the system is almost completely phase separated , later than with the scheme b and much later than with the scheme a.    all the cases shown correspond to the inertial regime and for reference we have plotted the line with slope @xmath92 . the sets 1 and 2 only differ in the value of the mobility @xmath35 .",
    "the main difference is that , before reaching the hydrodynamic @xmath92 regime , the growth is faster when the mobility is higher as it can be observed in fig .  1 . the slowing down of growth at large times is due to finite size effects appearing when the size of domains becomes comparable with the lattice size .    in order to understand the effects of density fluctuations , we show in fig .",
    "2 pictures of the system for the parameter set 2 at the time @xmath93 when the scheme a becomes unstable .",
    "simulations obtained with the old and the new schemes can be compared using the same initial conditions .",
    "differences in the order parameter field can be observed due to the different treatment of density fluctuations . when the scheme a is used",
    "the density plot shows the appearing of a peak which will grow indefinitely .",
    "the presence of the instability can be also observed in the middle low region of the concentration field as a white stripe . in the case with the scheme b fluctuations",
    "remain limited around the average value @xmath94 and are larger in correspondence of interfaces .",
    "the velocity field also shows an instability with the scheme a while with the new scheme regular local flows can be observed .",
    "> from sets 3 and 6 of fig .  1 we observe that @xmath87 behaves more regularly when calculated with the scheme c. this allows a better determination of the growth exponent .",
    "the effects of using a bigger lattice size can be seen in fig .  1 for cases 4 and 5 .    in recent simulations of three - dimensional systems based on the original algorithm the growth exponent",
    "was obtained by fitting the results of @xmath87 with the function @xmath95 in a time interval from the inflexion point to the onset of the instability @xcite .",
    "this procedure , as admitted by the same authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and discussed also in ref .",
    "@xcite , is very sensitive to small variations of the initial time considered , so that the evaluation of the growth exponent is problematic .",
    "we have applied a similar procedure to our results confirming the sensitivity to small variations of the initial time considered and finding different values for the exponent when the old or the new more stable schemes are applied .",
    "for example , for the set 2 with the old method , we find @xmath96 if we start from the inflexion point located at @xmath97 and @xmath98 if data are fitted from @xmath99 ( the run becomes unstable at t = 5985 ) .",
    "if we use the longer series of data obtained with the scheme c we get @xmath100 starting from the inflexion point or at a later time . for the set 4 the fitting procedure for the scheme a gives values of @xmath101 in the range @xmath102 changing the initial time for the fitting procedure , while the scheme b gives values in the range @xmath103 .",
    "other cases are also worst because sometimes , like for the set 3 , a reliable determination of the exponent is not possible with the old scheme .",
    "in this section we discuss how the presence of boundary conditions with walls affects the stability of simulations of phase separation .",
    "boundary conditions with walls are present in problems where a flow is applied to the system , e. g. shear flow , or in situations with geometrically complex boundaries .",
    "fluctuations of density are generally larger close to the walls due to the fact that the propagation and collision steps involve a reflection on the boundary .",
    "then , if the density is larger than the average value in a point close to a wall , the reflection tends to enhance this fluctuation .",
    "an example of the behavior of density just before the system becomes unstable is given in fig .  3 which shows clearly that the instability appears close to the walls .    also for the case with walls we have applied the schemes described in sec .",
    "ii for controlling the density fluctuations .",
    "in all the considered cases instabilities in simulations with walls occur much before than in simulations with periodic boundary conditions . in table",
    "ii we have reported the stability results for the original and the new scheme c. the comparison shows that in most of the cases the new algorithm can be very useful for running longer simulations of phase separation .",
    "in this paper we have considered two - dimensional lattice boltzmann methods for incompressible binary mixtures based on a free - energy functional approach .",
    "we have introduced mechanisms for controlling the total density fluctuations .",
    "these mechanisms were already shown useful for reproducing more accurately examples of analytical solutions for simple fluid flows .    in the case of binary mixtures , density fluctuations can induce numerical instabilities that make impossible to run long enough simulations as it is needed in problems like spinodal decomposition .",
    "we have used the new algorithms to study the phase separation of binary mixtures in the inertial regime at low viscosities when the effects of density fluctuations are worst .",
    "we have found that the stability of the simulations can be largely improved . for most of the parameters considered , differently from what happens with the original algorithm , it is possible to take under control density fluctuations eliminating the occurring of instabilities .",
    "this allows to study the properties of phase separating binary mixtures more reliably ; in particular , a more accurate evaluation of the growth exponent can be given .",
    "as a future research in this direction , it would be interesting to apply the lbm with improved stability to the case of a three - dimensional mixture .                            v. m. kendon , j.",
