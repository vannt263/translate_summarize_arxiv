    "this paper describes a new method to derive the elemental composition and the energy spectrum of cosmic rays for energies above a few hundred tev from measurements of cherenkov light and particle densities at ground level .",
    "the main idea is to determine the distance between the detector and the shower maximum , which is used to correct experimental observables for fluctuations in the shower developments .",
    "the depth of the shower maximum itself turns out to be a coarse measurement of the energy per nucleon of the nucleus hitting the atmosphere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : + after describing the experimental observables which will be used to reconstruct characteristics of the primary particle , the event simulation is sketched and features of the longitudinal and lateral shower development in the atmosphere are considered .",
    "the following three sections deal with reconstruction of the position of the shower maximum , of the energy per nucleon and of the primary energy .",
    "finally methods to determine the chemical composition are described followed by the summary and conclusions .",
    "although the method described in this paper was developed primarily for the hegra experiment it can equally well be applied to any installation registering cherenkov light and charged particles of extended air showers ( eas ) .",
    "the method can be easily generalized to all experimental setups which allow the determination of the distance to the shower maximum .",
    "however some properties of the hegra experiment need to be mentioned to understand details discussed in the following sections .",
    "+ the experiment hegra is a multi - component detector system described in detail elsewhere @xcite for the measurement of extended air showers ( eas ) . at a height of 2200 m a.s.l .",
    "it covers an area of 180@xmath1 . in this paper only the scintillator array of 245 huts with a grid spacing of 15 m including denser part near the center and the so called airobicc array of 72 open photomultipliers measuring the cherenkov light of air showers on a grid with 30 m spacing also with a central concentration , are used .",
    "the energy threshold ( demanding a signal from at least 14 scintillator or 6 airobicc huts ) lies at 20tev for proton and 80tev for iron induced showers .",
    "+ [ observables ] the measured particle density in the plane perpendicular to the shower axis is fitted by the nkg formula @xcite . in the fit a fixed moliere radius of 112",
    "m is used .",
    "the shape parameter _ age _ and the integral number of particles _ ne _ result from the fitting procedure . as the hegra scintillators are covered with 5 mm of lead ( which suppresses the detection of low energy electrons but allows the measurement of photons after pair production in the lead ) the values obtained for _ age _ and _ ne _ can not be compared to simple expectations from the cascade theory : _ age _ maybe smaller than 1 although the measurement takes place well behind the shower maximum while the shower size _ ne _ is generally larger than for measurements without lead on the scintillator detectors .",
    "+ the cherenkov light density is only analyzed in the interval 20 m @xmath2 r @xmath2 100 m from the shower core due to technical reasons although hegra in principle could sample the cherenkov light density up to 200 m . in the range between 20 and 100 m",
    "the cherenkov light density can be well described by an exponential @xmath3 as in the nkg fit two parameters are obtained from the analysis of the cherenkov light : the shape parameter _",
    "slope _ and the total number of cherenkov photons reaching the detector level between 20 and 100 m core distance _ l(20 - 100)_.",
    "eas in the energy range from 300tev to 10pev were simulated using the code corsika 4.01 @xcite .",
    "the model parameters of corsika were used with their default values and the fragmentation parameter was set to `` complete fragmentation '' .",
    "this results in a complete disintegration of the nucleus after the first interaction .",
    "showers induced by the primary proton , @xmath4 , oxygen and iron nuclei were calculated .",
    "+ the number of generated cherenkov photons corresponds to a wavelength interval of @xmath5}$ ] . in the main",
    "this paper assumes perfect measurements of the number of particles and cherenkov photons and a perfect shower core determination in order to concentrate on the physical principles and limitations of the methods to be described . to study the influence of the realistic experimental performance the events were passed through a carefully checked detector simulation @xcite ( performed with measured response functions ) and reconstructed with the same program as applied to real data . here",
    "each event was used 20 times to simulate different core positions inside and impact points outside the experimental area , which nevertheless fire sufficient huts of the arrays to fulfill the trigger conditions .",
    "+ in total 1168 events were generated with corsika4.01 with zenith angles of 0,15,25 and 35@xmath6  at discrete energies between 300tev and 10pev .",
    "some basic characteristics of the eas simulated with corsika4.01 are summarized here . features independent or sensitive to the mass of the nucleus hitting the atmosphere",
    "are described .",
    "these will allow the reconstruction of primary energy and mass from the observables mentioned above .",
    "shown on the left of figure[longdev ] are the mean longitudinal developments of 300tev proton and iron induced air showers , where electrons and positrons above an energy of 3mev were counted .",
    "this will be subsequently called , the shape of the longitudinal shower development . for each shower",
    "the maximum ( defined as the point in the shower development with the maximal number of particles ) was shifted to zero before averaging .",
    "afterwards the mean distribution was normalized to the mean particle number at the shower maximum .",
    "= 10.55 cm    [ longdev ]    concerning the shape of the longitudinal development behind the shower maximum no systematic differences depending on the primary particle are visible .",
    "the right plot in figure[longdev ] shows the change in the longitudinal development with increasing primary energy .",
    "the shapes broaden independently of the primary particle . both plots may be explained by a lucky combination of two effects :    1 .   as visible from simulated proton showers at 300tev and 5pev the longitudinal shower shape gets broader with increasing energy .",
    "2 .   after the first interaction",
    "an iron induced shower can be described as a superposition of nucleon induced subshowers .",
    "each of them have different subshower maxima fluctuating around a mean value . to achieve the distributions in figure[longdev ] the maxima of the whole eas ( and not the maxima of the subshowers )",
    "were overlayed .",
    "therefore a fe shower appears to be broader than a proton shower of the same energy per nucleon .",
    "+    in corsika 4.01 ( other simulations have to be tested ) both effects combine in such a way that the longitudinal shape of the eas behind the maximum becomes independent of the mass of the primary nucleon for the same primary energy",
    ". + the mean atmospheric depths of the maxima depend on the energy per nucleon e / a ( see section[detea ] ) and are subjected to large fluctuations .",
    "figure[detenuc ] shows the corresponding correlation : the column density traversed by a shower up to its maximum , named depth of maximum in the following ( calculable from the distance and the zenith angle ) , is correlated with e / a for all different simulated primaries from p to fe and all zenith angles .",
    "= 10.55 cm    [ detenuc ]    with the `` complete fragmentation '' option in our simulations the correlation follows a linear function . from figure[detenuc ] an elongation rate of approximately 82g/@xmath7/log@xmath8(e / e@xmath9 ) is derived : @xmath10\\,g / cm^2 . }",
    "\\label{eqenuc}\\ ] ] if the depth of the shower maximum is measured the energy per nucleon e / a can be inferred . due to statistical fluctuations in the shower development and therefore in the depth of the shower maximum ( figure[detenuc ] ) the resolution for e / a is modest .",
    "the spread decreases with increasing nucleon number a as the eas of a complex nucleus consists of many overlapping nucleon induced subshowers so that the whole eas exhibits less fluctuations than the individual subshowers .",
    "the resolution improves slightly also with rising e / a because more interactions take place until the shower maximum is reached .",
    "figure[detenuc ] ( right ) shows a parameterization of the fluctuations of the depth of the shower maxima . + it is interesting to note that for a specific primary particle and energy the number of particles in the shower maximum ne(max ) is independent of the depth of the maximum",
    ". therefore this number differs between proton and iron induced showers of the same primary energy even if the shower maxima are accidently at the same position .",
    "+ the most important characteristics of the longitudinal shower development discussed above and which will be used for the reconstruction of primary energy and mass in the next sections are :    * the longitudinal shower development behind the shower maximum does not depend on the mass of the primary particle and only slightly on the primary energy .",
    "* the mean depth of the shower maximum is determined only by the energy per nucleon e / a .",
    "* fluctuations in the position of the shower maximum decrease with increasing nucleon number and slightly with increasing energy .      in hadronic interactions",
    "the typical transverse momentum stays roughly constant with energy .",
    "therefore the lateral spread of hadronic showers should decrease with increasing energy per nucleon as the ratio of transverse to longitudinal momentum gets smaller in the early part of the shower development where the energies of the interacting particles are still comparable to the primary energy . in principle",
    "this effect could be measured for a known distance to the shower maximum i.e.  by comparing the number of cherenkov photons reaching the detector level relatively close to the core with the number of all photons detectable at the ground level or by analyzing _",
    "age_. in this way a separation of heavy and light primaries turns out to be possible at energies below 1pev . at energies in the knee region nearly no differences between proton and iron showers remain .",
    "obviously here e / a even for iron showers becomes so large that any influence of the hadronic transverse momentum is washed out and the lateral shape of the shower is dominated by scattering processes and interactions of particles of relatively low energies in the later part of the shower development .",
    "this section deals with the reconstruction of the distance between the shower maximum and the detector .",
    "it can be determined from the shape of the lateral cherenkov light density ( _ slope _ ) and in principle also from the shape parameter _ age _ of the particle distribution at detector level .",
    "+ [ recmaxcl ] as already noticed by patterson and hillas @xcite for showers with energies above 1pev the distance between the detector and the maximum of an eas can be inferred from the lateral distribution of the cherenkov light within about 100 m core distance .",
    "this is possible , because cherenkov light emitted at a specific height shows a specific lateral distribution at detector level .",
    "the light from the early part of the shower development , where the energies of the particles are still very high so that scattering angles are very small , is concentrated near 120 m ( the so called cherenkov ring ) .",
    "cherenkov light produced closer to the detector level hits the ground closer to the shower core .",
    "the measurable cherenkov light density of one eas is the sum of all contributions from all heights , where lateral distributions from different heights enter with amplitudes corresponding to the number of cherenkov light emitting particles in the different heights .",
    "hence the shape of the measurable lateral light density distribution depends on the longitudinal shower development .",
    "if the shower maximum approaches the observation level more light is produced close to the detector reaching the ground near the shower core .",
    "consequently the lateral cherenkov light density in the range up to 100 m core distance drops the steeper the closer the shower maximum approaches the detector .",
    "+ in figure[maxcor ] the correlation between the distance to the shower maximum and the parameter _ slope _ derived from the cherenkov light distribution is plotted for different primary nuclei and zenith angles up to 35 degree for primary energies of 0.3 and 5pev .",
    "= 10.55 cm    [ maxcor ]    the distance to the shower maximum can be accurately determined from _",
    "independent of the type of the primary particle and zenith angle the correlation between distance and _ slope _ depends slightly on the primary energy due to the changing longitudinal shower development .",
    "figure[maxcor ] shows simple polynomial fits describing the correlation rather well .",
    "the dependence of the fit parameters on log(e ) were again parameterized with polynomials resulting in a two dimensional function of _ slope _ and log(e ) to determine the distance to the shower maximum .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in the reconstruction of the distances depending on particle type or primary energy are less than 5% increasing a little for zenith angles of 35@xmath6 .",
    "such a systematic error for large zenith angles [ sysangel ] is expected as these showers develop longer at high altitude where the threshold energy for electrons to produce cherenkov light is higher than for showers with vertical incidence . +",
    "two shower properties contribute to the accuracy of the determination of the shower maximum .",
    "for a given primary energy the resolution improves with decreasing distance between detector and shower maximum and with increasing number of nucleons .",
    "= 10.55 cm    [ distrms ]    accidentally both contributions behave in such a manner that for fixed zenith angle and primary energy the resolution becomes independent of the mass of the primary particle within the statistical errors of the event sample .",
    "corresponding results are plotted in figure[distrms ] .",
    "the right part of figure[distrms ] shows the reason for the finite resolution of the distance determination with _",
    "slope_. showers , where the distance is underestimated , do not decay as fast as an average shower behind the shower maximum . consequently _ slope _ is smaller than expected and the distance is reconstructed too small .",
    "showers with overestimated distances exhibit a shorter longitudinal extension behind the shower maximum .",
    "it is interesting to note that the length of the shower behind the maximum is anti correlated with the number of particles in the maximum : the faster the decay after the maximum the more particles arise in the maximum .",
    "+ it is worthwhile to note that other approaches , like the reconstruction of the shower maximum from measurements of the time profile of the cherenkov light pulses at core distance beyond 150 m @xcite show different limitations as different shower properties than with _ slope _ are measured . in principle",
    "it is also possible to determine the distance to the shower maximum with _ age _ , but the experimental resolution of an _ age _ measurement can not compete with a _ slope _ determination .",
    "an improvement is only possible with a much denser coverage with active detector components than in present experiments ( typically around 1% ) . in addition _ age _ depends on the primary particle type so that an unbiased measurement of the position of the shower maximum is not possible at energies below 1pev .",
    "= 6.5 cm = 4.3 cm [ enucrms ]    with known distance to the shower maximum and known zenith angle the penetration depth of the shower into the atmosphere until it reaches the maximum can be inferred .",
    "e / a can be estimated using the correlation shown in figure[detenuc ] .",
    "the resolution for e / a is limited by the natural fluctuations of the shower maxima positions ( figure[detenuc ] ) and by principle accuracy limits of the _ slope _ method ( figure[distrms ] ) .",
    "of course further experimental errors may contribute in addition .",
    "in figure5 the different contributions ( to be added quadratically ) are compared . the uncertainty for proton induced showers",
    "is always dominated by statistical fluctuations of the shower developments , whereas for iron showers at low energies the intrinsic uncertainty of the _ slope _ method contributes significantly .    at energies around the `` knee '' the accuracy",
    "is always limited by variations of the shower developments .",
    "with a hegra type of detector two different methods may be used to reconstruct the primary energy :    1 .   interpreting the shower size at detector level measured by",
    "the scintillator array corresponds to a determination of the leakage out of the `` atmospheric calorimeter '' .",
    "these `` tailcatcher '' data allow for an accurate energy reconstruction if combined with information on the shower development .",
    "this ansatz can be applied as the shape of the longitudinal development behind the shower maximum does not depend on the primary particle ( see section[long ] ) and the distance to the shower maximum can be measured independently of the mass of the primary nucleus .",
    "2 .   the measurement of the amount of cherenkov light makes use of the atmosphere as a fully active calorimeter .",
    "although in principle superior to the `` tailcatcher '' approach this idea suffers from the large extension of the cherenkov light pool .",
    "depending on the distance to the shower maximum only 20 to 55% of all cherenkov photons reach the detector within 100 m core distance .",
    "in contrast to this the particle density drops very fast with increasing distance to the shower core so that a detector of the hegra size is sufficient to determine the number of all particles reaching the ground level .",
    "both algorithms described in the present paper can roughly be divided into two steps : first the distance of the shower maximum to the detector ( derived from the shape of the lateral cherenkov light density distribution ) is used to correct for different longitudinal shower developments . as only experimental quantities measuring the electromagnetic part of the air shower are considered here",
    "it follows naturally , that only the energy deposited in the electromagnetic cascade can be reconstructed directly . in a second step",
    "a correction for the non measured energy has to be performed .",
    "this correction depends on e / a only , which is determined from the depth of the shower maximum as described in the previous section .",
    "+ the following plots and parameterizations only take into account showers which reach their maximum at least 50g/@xmath11 above the detector , because otherwise one can hardly decide whether a shower reaches its maximum above detector level at all .",
    "the treatment of showers arriving at detector level before reaching their maximum has to be considered separately .      in this section",
    "the primary energy will be reconstructed in the following manner :    1 .   with the known distance to the shower maximum",
    "the number of particles in the shower maximum ne(max ) is derived from the measurement at detector level _ ne_. 2 .",
    "ne(max ) is proportional to the energy deposited in the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "3 .   from the energy per nucleon e / a and ne(max )",
    "the total primary energy is inferred .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    l[0pt]7 cm    = 6.5 cm = 4.3 cm    the first step for reconstructing the primary energy is the determination of ne(max ) from the observables _ ne _ and _ slope_. as the scintillator huts of the hegra experiment are covered with 1@xmath12 of lead the total number of particles is not measured directly . in simulations",
    "the ratio of measured particles and the number of particles before the lead was found to depend only on the distance to the shower maximum but not on primary energy nor on the nucleon number of the primary particle .",
    "therefore no systematic uncertainties in the energy reconstruction originate from the lead coverage . due to the conversion of photons in the lead",
    "the measured number of particles is larger than ne(max ) for showers reaching their maximum close to the detector . in figure[eemcor ]",
    "the ratio of _ ne _ to ne(max ) is correlated with _ slope _ measuring the distance between detector and shower maximum . using _ slope _ in this correlation instead of",
    "the distance permits the handling of all energies in one correlation :    @xmath13(_slope _ ) : :    is applied to determine ne(max ) from the observed _ ne _ at detector    level and from _ slope _ measuring the distance to the shower maximum .",
    "no change of the correlation for different primary energies was observed ( compare table[tabene ] and the related discussion in the text ) .",
    "no systematic differences between different primary particles are visible . in the second step the primary energy",
    "is determined from ne(max ) and e / a . two sub steps are necessary here : first the energy contained in the electromagnetic part of the eas has to be derived , followed by an e / a dependent correction to determine the primary energy .",
    "the electromagnetic energy is proportional to ne(max ) for a fixed shape of the longitudinal shower development . because the shape changes slightly with primary energy e both ne(max ) and e are necessary to determine the electromagnetic energy . during our simulations",
    "the total amount of electromagnetic energy in an eas ( defined as the sum of all @xmath14 energies ) was not recorded so that the ratio of electromagnetic energy to the primary energy and the ratio of ne(max ) to the electromagnetic energy could not be calculated directly for the simulated events .",
    "hence arbitrary factors may be multiplied to the two correction functions below as long as their product is kept constant .",
    "the functions are :    @xmath13(e ) : :    takes into account the change of the longitudinal shower development    with e. @xmath13(e / a ) : :    is used to correct from the electromagnetic energy to the total energy    e of the primary nucleus and will be discussed a little more detailed .    the fraction of the primary energy which goes into the electromagnetic part of the shower rises with increasing energy as the probability for hadrons to perform subsequent interaction with the production of additional neutral pions increases with the hadron energy . for a nucleus",
    "the fraction of the electromagnetic energy should depend only on e / a .",
    "following the results of @xcite a function was fitted to the correlation of ne(max)/e with e / a using the generated mc events : @xmath15\\,tev^{-1}\\ . } \\label{eqgab}\\ ] ] the ratio of this correction for protons to iron at 300tev amounts to 1.34 decreasing to 1.16 at 5pev .",
    "the difference between proton and iron showers is larger than derived by extrapolating the results in @xcite to the mean atomic number of air because the fraction of the total energy deposited in the electromagnetic cascade is different in air showers compared to showers developing in solid state calorimeters : in air the interaction length for charged pions is comparable to their decay length so that the competition between pion decay and secondary interaction with subsequent production of neutral pions ( feeding the em .",
    "cascade by their decay to two photons ) lowers the fraction of energy deposited in the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "now the primary energy is calculable by @xmath16 due to the energy dependence of the correlation between _ slope _ and distance to the maximum and of ne(max)/e ( both due to a slightly changing shape of the longitudinal shower development ) energy and distance to the shower maximum can not strictly be determined separately but have to be calculated iteratively .",
    "however the energy dependencies are small .",
    "therefore in the calculation as a start value a parameterization of the correlation of distance and _ slope _ neglecting any energy dependence is used to derive a first distance value . with this an energy estimation is calculated and with this energy a new distance . this distance in turn gives a new energy value again .",
    "after two iterations usually neither the distance nor the energy results change further .",
    "+ the application of the whole procedure to simulated events results in systematic uncertainties on the order of 5% .",
    "several contributions to the energy resolution for iron and proton showers are listed in table[tabene ] .",
    ".rms values of different quantities contributing to the energy resolution which can be achieved with the method using _ ne _ and _ slope_. in the first two rows the identity of the primary particle is used from the simulations .",
    "`` ne(max ) '' , `` ne at detector '' and `` dist '' are mc quantities , _ ne _ and _ slope _ experimental observables .",
    "e / a denotes the energy per nucleon , which in the last line of the table is reconstructed from _ slope _ and the zenith angle . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ taballco ]    clearly an analysis of the chemical composition improves if measurements of the longitudinal and lateral shower developments are combined .",
    "light and heavy particles can be separated rather well . however with the four observables used here primary nuclei with masses similar to oxygen can be separated only in a statistical sense but not on an event by event basis .",
    "it seems to be difficult to distinguish between primary protons and @xmath4 particles .",
    "+      studies of systematic effects related to the corsika code ( stepwidth of the egs part ) , atmospheric transmission , the fragmentation of the primary nucleus and the influence of different models to simulate the high energy interactions of the cr will be described in a forthcoming publication . in general",
    "the observables analyzed here show up to be much less model dependent than hadronic shower properties or muon distributions , mainly because the development of a shower behind its maximum determines the cherenkov light and particle measurement , as considered throughout this paper .",
    "in this paper methods were presented to determine energy and mass of charged cosmic rays from ground based observations of the electromagnetic cascade of air showers . from the slope of the lateral cherenkov light density in the range of 20 to 100 m core distance the position of the shower maximum",
    "can be inferred without knowledge of the nucleon number of the primary particle .",
    "this leads to an unbiased determination of the energy per nucleon and , combined with the shower size at detector level or the number of registered cherenkov photons , to a measurement of the primary energy .",
    "thus a measurement of the energy spectrum and a coarse determination of the chemical composition are possible without any a priori hypotheses . + with the observables considered in the present paper the energy resolution for primary nuclei is limited to approximately 30% at 300tev improving to 10% at 5pev due to natural fluctuations in the shower development .",
    "further improvements of these results are only possible if accurate measurements of the non electromagnetic components of eas are added .",
    "+ at energies below 1pev , where results from eas measurements can be compared to direct data from balloon flights , the sensitivity of the analysis of air showers by observing cherenkov light and particles at detector level can be substantially improved by combining the results related to the longitudinal shower development with parameters derived from the lateral extension .",
    "this allows detailed tests of the described method to determine the chemical composition and the energy spectrum of cosmic rays .",
    "+ one main characteristic of deriving energy and mass of primary nuclei from observations of the electromagnetic component of extensive air showers with the observables used here is the fact , that it are mainly the longitudinal shower development behind the shower maximum , the number of particles at the maximum and the penetration depth of the shower until it reaches the maximum , which determine the results . while the first two items do not vary much for different models describing the development of air showers",
    "the last item is more model dependent . in order to achieve results being as model independent as possible",
    "it is very desirable to combine the method described in this paper with complementary measurements .",
    "analyses of the early stage of the shower development , of the hadronic component of eas or detailed studies of the shower core may be considered for this purpose . + * acknowledgments * + the author would like to thank the hegra members for their collaboration .",
