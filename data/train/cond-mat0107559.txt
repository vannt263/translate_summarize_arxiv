    "recently there is a growing interest in a new class of lyotropic liquid crystals ( lcs ) , so called lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals ( lclcs ) due to their diverse potential application in many areas such as dyes , drugs , nucleic acids , antibiotics and anti - cancer agents  @xcite , .",
    "dichroic thin films formed from lclcs can be used both as alignment layers and polarizers for lc cells @xcite .",
    "these materials are fundamentally different from conventional amphiphilic systems : their molecules are disc - like or plank - like rather than rod - like , rigid rather than flexible and aromatic rather than aliphatic . due to their disc - like molecular shape chromonic molecules stack face to face forming columnar aggregates .",
    "though there is no clear understanding of the nature of forces responsible for this face - to - face stacking , it is generally believed that the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction of the aromatic cores is the main mechanism of molecular face - to - face stacking  @xcite .",
    "hydrophilic ionic groups at the periphery of the molecules make them water soluble .",
    "the two principal chromonic mesophases are chromonic @xmath1 and @xmath2 phase .",
    "the basic structural unit of both phases is the untilted stack of the molecules .",
    "the @xmath1 phase is the nematic phase in which the molecular stacks has orientational order but no positional ordering and is formed when the concentration is low . at higher concentration",
    "these molecular stacks arrange themselves in a hexagonal pattern forming the @xmath2 phase . in recent years",
    ", many new chromonic phases has been reported  @xcite which are formed by aqueous cyanine dyes .",
    "some of the liquid - crystalline aggregates formed by the cyanine dyes are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "unlike the conventional amphiphilic system , the chromonic system does not have any critical micellar concentration ( cmc ) . to avoid the unfavorable contact of the hydrophobic part of the molecules with the solvent ,",
    "the molecules start to stack together forming columns even in dilute solution . as the column length increases , the fraction of the total molecular surface exposed to the solvent decreases .",
    "there is widespread experimental evidence that there is no optimum column length or aggregation number like the conventional amphiphilic system forming micellar aggregates .",
    "the micelle has a optimum size depending on the packing parameters which in turn depend on the ratio of the size of head and tail group @xcite .",
    "the chromonic aggregation behavior is termed as ` isodesmic ' in contrast to the ` non - isodesmic ' behavior observed for simple amphiphilic system .",
    "for isodesmic behavior , addition of each chromonic molecule to the columnar aggregate is accompanied by a constant free energy increment .",
    "therefore , with the increase in column length the free energy gradually decreases , in contrast with the non - isodesmic behavior of simple surfactant system , where micelle formation is accompanied by sharp free energy minima .",
    "the self - assembly of chromonic molecules is governed by many factors such as molecular structure , concentration , temperature , solvent polarity and ionic strength .",
    "so far there is no clear understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and the structure of the supramolecular aggregates formed by the lclc materials .",
    "consequently many different aggregate structures have been proposed based on different experimental results .    in this paper",
    ", we have developed idealized molecular models of lclcs which capture the overall shape of the lclc molecules and the nature of their interactions in an approximate way . to understand the self - assembly of chromonic molecules , we have carried out simulations of binary mixture of lclc molecules and water , and have studied the effect of concentration , temperature and molecular shape on the nature of the resulting mesophases .",
    "we have also computed the free energy associated with the addition of each chromonic molecule to a columnar aggregate .",
    "the method gives us the possibility to test the widely accepted isodesmic behavior of the chromonic aggregation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe our model and the simulation technique .",
    "the results on the columnar aggregates , in bulk water , formed by the chromonic molecules are reported in section 3 .",
    "we describe the method of computation of free - energy by umbrella sampling in section 4 .",
    "finally , a summary of the main results and the conclusions drawn from these are given in section 5 .",
    "we have modeled chromonic molecules as diamond shaped constituted of @xmath3 ( model 1 ) tangent spheres of diameter @xmath4 bonded together ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we also considered another variant of the model where the chromonic molecules are disk shaped constituted of @xmath5 ( model 2 ) tangent sphere of diameter @xmath4 bonded together ( figure 2 ) .",
    "model 2 is similar to the model considered by edwards et .",
    "@xcite with different kind of interactions . in case of model 1",
    "the @xmath5 spheres forming the disc are hydrophobic and the @xmath6 spheres at the two ends are hydrophilic . in case of model 2 , the @xmath7 outer spheres",
    "are hydrophilic and the inner sphere at the center of each molecule is treated as hydrophobic . water molecule is modeled as a sphere",
    ".    attractive interaction between like particles ( water - water , hydrophilic - water , and hydrophilic - hydrophilic ) is modeled via a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the separating distance between the two interacting particles .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 governs the strength of interaction and @xmath4 defines a length scale .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath11 and @xmath12 for all interactions .",
    "we have taken a cut - off @xmath13 , large enough to include excluded volume effects and attractive forces .",
    "repulsive hydrophobic - hydrophilic and water - hydrophobic interactions are modeled by a truncated and shifted lj potential ( wca potential ) :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 .    for mc studies using",
    "lj potential it is convenient to introduce reduced units . in terms of @xmath16 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 ,",
    "some of the quantities of interest are density @xmath17 , temperature @xmath18 , and pressure @xmath19 .",
    "the simulation has been carried out both in @xmath20 ( fixed number of particles at constant volume and temperature ) and @xmath21 fixed number of particles at constant pressure and temperature ) ensemble . during each mc step either chromonic or water molecules",
    "were chosen randomly and displaced using metropolis criteria .",
    "the reorientation move was performed using quaternions  @xcite .",
    "we have carried out simulations for different concentrations of the chromonic molecules at different temperatures .",
    "the concentration of chromonic is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of atoms constituting a single chromonic molecules , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number of chromonic and water molecules respectively , @xmath23 is @xmath3 for model 1 and @xmath5 for model 2 .",
    "in order to investigate the spontaneous formation of chromonic aggregates and their morphology , various choices of initial conditions were used .",
    "model chromonic and water molecules are initially dispersed randomly in a @xmath26 system with periodic boundary condition . unless specified all of the results shown below are for model 1 .",
    "instantaneous snapshots of the columnar aggregates formed by chromonic molecules are shown in figure [ snap1 ] and figure [ snap2 ] . at low concentration",
    "the chromonic molecules form short columns and with the increase in concentration the length and the number of the columnar aggregates increases . at higher concentration they form chain like aggregates .",
    "we have also calculated various positional and orientational pair correlation functions for the chromonic as well as water molecules to characterize the structure of the columnar aggregates .",
    "@xmath27 is the radial distribution function of the center of mass of the chromonic molecules and is defined as @xmath28 @xmath29 is the same for solvent molecules ( water ) and is defined in an analogous way . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the orientational correlation functions and are defined as    @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the relative separation of the center of the @xmath35th and @xmath36th chromonic molecules , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are a unit vectors lying parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the the @xmath35th chromonic molecule , @xmath39 is the second legendre polynomial , and the sums range over all pairs of molecules .    in practice , we work either with fully angle - averaged correlation functions , e.g. @xmath40 or with cylindrically - averaged correlation functions , e.g. @xmath41 here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the components of @xmath44 parallel and perpendicular to the orientation of the disc at the origin of the coordinate frame ( see figure [ free_geometry](a ) ) , i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the azimuthal orientation of @xmath44 about @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined in an analogous way .    in figure [ gr_cor ]",
    "we have plotted spherically averaged correlation function @xmath52 for different chromonic concentration and the first peak at @xmath53 signify strong positional correlation between chromonic molecules .",
    "successive small peaks at @xmath54 etc .",
    "indicate that the molecules aggregate in a columnar fashion as in figure [ fig1](a ) or ( b ) .",
    "the pair correlation between water molecules plotted in figure [ gss_cor ] exhibits the expected liquid like behavior with short range positional order .",
    "more detailed structural informations for the chromonic aggregate emerges from the two - dimensional correlation function @xmath55 and @xmath51 , shown in figure [ orient_cor ] . with the reference chromonic molecule situated at the origin the three prominent peaks at @xmath56",
    "indicate that the chromonic molecules form columnar aggregates and the molecules within the columns is organized as in figure [ fig1](a ) . due to close packing effect",
    "the center of mass of the chromonic molecules within the columns can be shifted with respect to another by @xmath4 which is reflected in the broadening of the peaks around @xmath57 .",
    "examination of @xmath51 reveals a strong intensity ( @xmath58 ) peak around @xmath59 which indicates that the chromonic molecules within the columns are parallel to each other .",
    "we also compute average the aggregation number to study its dependence on chromonic concentration .",
    "we identify two chromonic molecules belonging to a cluster if the distance separating two monomers belonging to two chromonic molecules is @xmath60 . from the cluster size distribution",
    "we have calculated the average aggregation number through the following equation :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the number of cluster of size @xmath63 . in figure [ clust ]",
    "we have shown the average aggregate size @xmath64 as a function of chromonic concentration . at low concentration @xmath65 . at higher concentration the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath47 is stronger than power law .",
    "similar behavior is observed for conventional lyotropic systems @xcite .    since in our simulation",
    "we do not observe the formation of regular columnar aggregates as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , we have simulated pre - assembled single and multiple columnar aggregates to test the stability of columnar aggregates .",
    "the simulation was done in @xmath20 ensemble .",
    "the columnar aggregates remain stable over simulation time , in contrast to model 2 in which case pre - assembled columnar aggregates break and the system becomes isotropic . in addition our simulation with model 2 do not exhibits the spontaneous formation of columnar aggregates ( figure [ modelasnap ] ) .",
    "this indicates that we need to make judicious choice of the ratio of number of hydrophilic and hydrophobic units , an overall hydrophobicity of the chromonic molecules being necessary for the spontaneous self - assembly .",
    "to calculate the free energy associated with the formation of columnar aggregates we have calculated the free energy of association in pulling apart two chromonic molecules by using umbrella sampling  @xcite .",
    "the distance @xmath66 separating two chromonic molecules were confined ( figure [ free_geometry ] ) by means of a harmonic potential of the form : @xmath67 where @xmath66 is the equilibrium distance imposed between the center of mass of two chromonic molecules .",
    "the equilibrium distance were varied from @xmath68 to @xmath69 in steps of @xmath70 - @xmath71 .",
    "note that the equilibrium distance between two chromonic molecules can not be less than @xmath4 . from the individual biased average probabilities , @xmath72 , obtained for each @xmath66",
    ", unbiased free energy ( @xmath73 ) can be constructed self - consistently using the weighted histogram analysis method ( wham )  @xcite .",
    "we have performed mc simulation at constant pressure for 25 windows .",
    "the value of the spring constant used was @xmath74 .",
    "we have performed some simulation with higher values of spring constant @xmath75 and found qualitatively similar free energy behavior .",
    "the probability distribution of the distance @xmath9 separating two chromonic molecules is , @xmath76     \\exp [ -\\beta v({\\bf r}^n)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for values of @xmath9 for which @xmath72 is exceedingly small . here",
    ", @xmath77 is a dirac delta function , @xmath1 is the number of particles , @xmath78 denotes the set of particle coordinates , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath81 is the absolute temperature , @xmath82 is the potential energy , and @xmath83 is a normalization factor ( the configurational partition function ) .",
    "however , problem arises due to the fact that to @xmath72 becomes exceedingly small for values of @xmath9 which give significant contribution to the free energy .",
    "umbrella sampling makes use of a biasing potential to sample the region of phase space for which @xmath72 is exceedingly small .",
    "the distribution of @xmath9 in the presence of a biasing potential is @xmath84 \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\exp \\{-\\beta [ v({\\bf r}^n ) + u(r)]\\ } \\nonumber \\\\     & = & { z \\over { z^\\prime } } \\exp[-\\beta u(r ) ] p(r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the partition function for the biased hamiltonian . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath86 p^\\prime(r).\\ ] ]    thus , the distribution function @xmath72 can be obtained ( to within a multiplicative constant ) from a measurement of the biased distribution @xmath87 .",
    "the helmholtz free energy @xmath73 as a function of @xmath9 can then be obtained ( to within an additive constant ) from @xmath88.\\ ] ] by piecing together the relative free energies measured using a number of biasing potentials , it is possible to construct @xmath89 over any specified range of @xmath9 .",
    "we have computed the potential of mean force of bringing two initially separated chromonic molecules on top of each other by the above method and the result is shown in figure [ free_energy2 ] .",
    "this case is referred to column 2 ( figure [ free_geometry](a ) ) . from the free energy curve",
    "we see that there is strong attraction between chromonic molecules at short distance , leading to face - to - face chromonic aggregation .",
    "both energetic and entropic factors lead to this attraction : by stacking on top of each other the unfavorable hydrophobic interaction with water molecules is reduced and this stacking results in a net increase in the volume available to the water molecules and thereby increasing their entropy . at intermediate separation water molecules",
    "form solvation shells between the two chromonic molecules which results in a depletion repulsion between the chromonic molecules and thereby increasing the free energy barrier between them . at larger separation two chromonics",
    "do not interact with each other and so the potential of mean force levels off .",
    "however , at this stage we are unable to separate the entropic and energetic contribution in the free energy .",
    "we have also computed different orientational pair correlations @xmath90 and @xmath91 between the two chromonic molecules and are shown in figure [ orient_cor2 ] .    from the @xmath90",
    "we see that at the minimum separation ( @xmath92 ) the two chromonic molecules are parallel and stacked together .",
    "however , their in - plane unit vectors make an angle to each other as is evident from @xmath91 .",
    "as the separation increases they start loosing their orientational correlations .",
    "next we compute free energy of association of a chromonic molecules onto a columnar aggregates formed by two chromonics ( referred to as column 3 , figure [ free_geometry](b ) ) and three chromonic molecules ( referred to as column 4 , figure [ free_geometry](c ) ) respectively . within the columnar aggregate , the separation and orientation of the two chromonics",
    "are kept fixed which was computed at the location of the free energy minima for the column 2 case ( see figure [ free_energy2 ] ) .",
    "the computed free energy is shown in figure [ free_energy3 ] .",
    "the free energy curves has the same features as in the case column 2 ( figure [ free_energy2 ] ) . at large separation chromonic molecules",
    "do not see each other and consequently free energy reaches a plateau at larger separation . at intermediate separation",
    "the chromonic molecules start interacting with each other and start expelling the water molecules form the region between them to aggregate on top of each other and",
    "this leaves more room for the water molecules . this way water molecules gain entropy and chromonic molecules gain energetically",
    "( less contact with water molecules ) .",
    "this depletion effect eventually leads single chromonic molecules going on top of the existing columnar aggregates of length 2 or 3 .",
    "such type of depletion attraction and repulsion has been found between macromolecules immersed in a fluid of much smaller particles @xcite . as in the case of column 2 ,",
    "we have also computed the orientational pair correlation for column 3 and 4 . in case of column 3 ,",
    "the behavior is similar to the case of column 2 .",
    "however for column 4 , now the chromonic molecules remain perfectly parallel both within and perpendicular to the chromonic plane .",
    "the presence of three chromonic molecules within the aggregate strongly influence the fourth one whcih is coming on top of it .",
    "we have developed a class of idealized model for the chromonic molecules .",
    "simple site - interaction models represent a useful class of models for the study of the chromonic liquid crystalline self - assembly . for sufficiently hydrophobic molecular models formation of columnar aggregates",
    "is observed .",
    "our free energy computation for different length of columnar aggregates gives valuable insight .",
    "however , more effort is required to test the isodesmic hypothesis . future work will focus on improving configurational sampling ( via rigid - body molecular dynamics ) and on investigations of chemically realistic models of chromonic lcs .",
