    "the properties of neutron stars , like mass and radii , can be precisely measured with the gradual development of astronomical observation technology .",
    "this development has promoted theoretical studies on the nuclear many - body theory  @xcite , especially on the properties of nuclear matter at high densities , where high density refers to densities above 3 times the nuclear saturation density in the core of a neutron star .    in the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation  @xcite , which is derived by solving the einstein equations for a spherically symmetric and time invariant system ,",
    "the properties of a neutron star are fixed by the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron star matter , which is a charge neutral system in @xmath1 equilibrium .",
    "the eoss of neutron star matter have been widely studied using various nuclear many - body theories , by the application of density functional theory ( dft ) and _ ab initio _ methods in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "the effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interactions are adopted in dft , which are determined by fitting the empirical saturation properties of nuclear matter and the ground states of finite nuclei .",
    "there are usually two schemes used in dft , i.e. , relativistic and non - relativistic approximation .",
    "the most popular nuclear many - body theory in non - relativistic dft is the skyrme - hartree - fock theory  @xcite , which was constructed based on the point - coupling @xmath0 interaction . in the relativistic version ,",
    "covariant dft was proposed based on the one - boson - exchange picture  @xcite .",
    "the eoss of dft around the saturation density region can be constrained very well and are kept consistent within different effective @xmath0 interactions . however , their behaviors in the high density region , especially in the cores of neutron stars , show variability , which generate widely different predictions of the properties of neutron stars . with the discoveries of massive neutron stars ,",
    "whose masses are around @xmath4 , many dft interactions are eliminated  @xcite .    on the other hand , in the state - of - the - art nuclear many - body methods , via _",
    "ab initio _ calculations , a realistic @xmath0 interaction is used that is obtained by reproducing the @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "the most popular realistic @xmath0 potentials are constructed by the meson - exchange picture  @xcite and chiral effective field theory  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 potentials , based on chiral low - momentum expansions , are soft cores at short distances due to pion exchange ; whereas , in the meson - exchange potential , such as the bonn potential , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson exchanges are essential in the core region of the @xmath0 interaction , which generate very strong repulsive core .",
    "there are also other high - momentum effects at short distance , such as the strong tensor force , besides strong repulsion  @xcite which is related with the nucleon inner structure  @xcite in the realistic @xmath0 interaction .",
    "since 1950 , many microscopic many - body methods have been proposed to take such high momentum contributions into account .",
    "_ used the hyper - netted chain - summation technique in the non - relativistic variational method  @xcite and the av18 potential  @xcite to calculate the eos of neutron rich matter  @xcite with a three - body force .",
    "krastev and sammarruca adopted the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf )  @xcite theory to study the properties of neutron stars with bonn potentials  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also compared their results with the calculations made by akmal using the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo method  @xcite .",
    "discussed the properties of neutron star with @xmath0 interactions from chiral effective filed theory and constrained the neutron star mass - radius relation in the framework of renormalization group theory  @xcite .",
    "all of these values of eoss obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations agree well with each other in the high density region and generate similar properties of massive neutron stars .    for neutron rich matter , the tensor effect in realistic @xmath0 interaction is suppressed largely in the @xmath7 isospin channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is enough to explicitly consider only the short - range correlation in neutron rich matter .",
    "based on this motivation , a relativistic central variational ( rcv ) method was proposed by including a central correlation jastrow function  @xcite , which was inspired by the series works by panda _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in the rcv method ,",
    "the solutions of the relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) method  @xcite were chosen as the trial wave function of the total system .",
    "the saturation properties obtained by the rcv method are @xmath8 different from the empirical data , likely because of the lack of tensor correlation in symmetric nuclear matter . however , the eos of pure neutron matter within the bonn potentials can reproduce the results from rbhf theory very well",
    ". the solutions of the rhf method in nuclear matter are constructed by spinors with plane wave functions , the summation of spin and isospin for which can be easily and systematically evaluated via the feynman trace technology .",
    "therefore , the calculation in the rcv method for neutron - rich matter is essential and economical , when compared with other time - consuming _ ab initio _ methods such as non - relativistic variational methods and the rbhf theory in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , the calculation procedures of the _ ab initio _ aforementioned methods , when they were applied to neutron star matter in @xmath1 equilibrium , are complicated , therefore , the equations of @xmath1 equilibrium are usually solved with various approximations instead of self - consistence treatments  @xcite .",
    "hence , the intention of this work is to apply the rvc method to calculate the eoss of neutron star matter in @xmath1 equilibrium self - consistently and use these eoss to study the properties of neutron stars with realistic @xmath0 interaction , bonn potentials .",
    "in addition , we compare our results with the calculations of other _ ab initio _ methods and discuss the role of central correlation in neutron stars . in sect .",

    "3 , numerical results are presented on the properties of neutron stars and are compared with other calculations . in sect .",
    "4 , we give a summary of the present work .",
    "we firstly show the hamiltonian of the bonn potential  @xcite , which is constructed based on the one - boson - exchange potential . it is defined as a sum of one - particle amplitudes of six bosons , consisting of @xmath9 and @xmath10 pseudovectors , @xmath11 and @xmath12 scalars , and @xmath6 and @xmath5 vector mesons , h&=&^a_it_i+^a_i , jv_i , j&=&d^3(x)(-i+m_n)(x)&&+_i=,,,,,d^3d^3(x)(x)(x)(x ) , where @xmath13 corresponds the nucleon field .",

    "meanwhile , a monopole form factor should be considered , f_i(q^2)= , for each meson - nucleon vertex denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "all coupling constants and cut - off momenta @xmath20 were determined by fitting the @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "in the rcv method , one introduces a central correlation function of the wave function of the rhf theory as the trial wave function of the nuclear matter system @xcite , to treat the strong short - range repulsion , |=f| , where @xmath21 is the rhf wave function , and the correlation factor @xmath22 is chosen to be a product of two - body correlation functions @xmath23 ,",

    "the proton and neutron cases are distinguished by the superscript @xmath37 .",
    "the exchange contribution of @xmath11 meson @xmath38 as an example is given by , v^_e=^k_f_0pdppdp . here , the moment dependent functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are various angular integrals related with the meson - exchange potentials , which are listed in the appendix of ref .",

    "the correlation function is chosen as , f(r)=1-(c_0+c_1r+c_2r^2+c_3r^3)e^-c_4r . where the exponential term makes @xmath42 unity at large distance .",
    "a natural choice from the unitary property of the correlation function is a normalization constraint on @xmath23 , [ nc ] d^3 r_ij[f^2(r_ij)-1]=0 , and should go to zero for small @xmath43 because of the repulsive core of @xmath0 interaction , which lead to @xmath44 .",

    "<S> the properties of neutron stars are investigated within the relativistic central variational method by using a realistic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the strong repulsion of realistic @xmath0 interactions at short distances is treated by a jastrow central correlation function , whose form is completely determined through minimization of the total energy of the nuclear many - body system . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic hartree - fock wave functions are chosen as the trial wave function . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state of the neutron star matter in @xmath1 equilibrium is obtained self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> we further determine the properties of neutron stars via the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation using bonn a , b , and c potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum masses of neutron stars with these realistic potentials are around @xmath2 and their corresponding radii are around @xmath3 km . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in accordance with the calculations of the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock theory with the same potentials . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also find that the splitting of proton - neutron effective masses will be reversed at high density in the neutron star matter , which are caused by the contribution of short - range correlation on kinetic energy . </S>"
