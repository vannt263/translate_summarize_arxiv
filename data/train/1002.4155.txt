    "the idea of the standard model extended by weak scale broken supersymmetry ( susy ) is extremely attractive in that it stabilizes the weak scale against quantum corrections , and allows ultimately for an embedding in grand unified theories ( guts)@xcite .",
    "guts are also highly attractive in that they unify the disparate forces contained in the sm into ( usually ) a single gauge group .",
    "susy guts receive some well - known indirect support from experiment in that the three gauge couplings when extrapolated up to @xmath5 gev via the mssm rges@xcite very nearly meet at a point !",
    "the gauge group @xmath0 is especially compelling@xcite . not only does it unify the sm forces , but it also unifies the sm _ matter _ of each generation into the 16-dimensional spinor representation .",
    "this unification only works if there is in addition to the sm superfields , a gauge singlet @xmath6 , for generations @xmath7 , which contains a right - hand neutrino state , as is required for see - saw neutrino masses@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is naturally anomaly - free , thus explaining the otherwise ad - hoc anomaly cancellation in the sm or in @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 provides a basis for @xmath9-parity conservation , in that only _ matter - matter - higgs _ couplings are allowed , while the @xmath9-violating _ matter - higgs _ or _ matter - matter - matter _ couplings are forbidden .",
    "if @xmath0 is broken properly , the @xmath9-parity survives as an exact symmetry@xcite .",
    "the simplest @xmath0 models also allow for higgs unification , since both @xmath10 and @xmath11 live in the 10 of @xmath0 . finally ,",
    "in the simplest models , we also expect @xmath1 third generation yukawa coupling unification at @xmath12 .",
    "the above features have convinced many theorists that the main ideas behind @xmath0 susy guts are surely right ( even while most or all explicit models in the literature are likely wrong ) .    here",
    ", we will assume ( motivated by gauge coupling unification ) that the mssm , or mssm plus gauge singlets , is the correct effective field theory valid from @xmath13 tev all the way up to @xmath14 gev .",
    "we will also require that the third generation @xmath1 yukawa couplings should unify to reasonable ( @xmath15 ) precision at @xmath16 .    to test yukawa unification , we scan over @xmath0-inspired susy parameter space : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the common matter - scalar mass at @xmath16 , @xmath19 the common higgs mass , @xmath20 the common gaugino mass and @xmath21 the common trilinear soft term .",
    "@xmath22 parametrizes the higgs multiplet splitting@xcite , _ i.e. _ @xmath23 as is given by @xmath24-term mass contributions arising from the breaking of @xmath0 .",
    "we will examine two cases : the `` just - so '' higgs splitting ( hs ) model , where only the higgs scalars split , and the dr3 model , where full scalar @xmath24-term splitting is invoked , along with right - hand neutrino contributions , and possible third generation scalar mass splitting ( _ i.e. _ @xmath25 at @xmath16 ) .",
    "we use the isajet / isasugra sparticle mass spectrum calculator@xcite .",
    "this includes full two - loop rges@xcite , an rg - improved one - loop effective potential calculation ( evaluated at an optimized scale to account for leading two - loop effects ) and full 1-loop sparticle mass corrections@xcite .",
    "especially important is including the weak scale @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 self energy corrections when transitioning from mssm to sm effective theories ; these depend on the entire superparticle mass spectrum , and are especially large for the @xmath29 correction at large @xmath30@xcite .",
    "exhaustive scans over parameter space reveal that @xmath1 yukawa unification only occurs when the following conditions are met@xcite :    * @xmath31 , with * @xmath32 tev , * @xmath20 very small @xmath33 gev ) , * @xmath34 * @xmath35 .    these conditions , derived earlier by bagger _",
    "et al._@xcite , yield a _ radiatively driven inverted scalar mass hierarchy _ ( rimh ) .",
    "the physical sparticle mass spectrum is then given by    * first / second generation squarks and sleptons @xmath36 tev , * third generation squarks , sleptons , @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath39 tev , * light gauginos with @xmath4 gev , @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 gev .",
    "the heavy first / second generation squarks and sleptons can act to suppress possible susy fcnc and @xmath42 violating interactions , and proton decay .",
    "the much lighter third generation scalars meet the needs for technical naturalness .",
    "note that yukawa - unified susy provides a viable realization of the `` effective susy '' scenario put forth by cohen , kaplan and nelson@xcite , while maintaining the mssm as the correct effective theory all the way up to @xmath16 .",
    "the hs model is found to give many cases with _ exact _",
    "@xmath1 unification@xcite ( which is perhaps better than expected , given the theoretical uncertainties of the perturbative calculations ) .",
    "the dr3 model@xcite , with full @xmath24-term splitting , can give yukawa unification down to the 2% level , but only if neutrino yukawa running is included down to @xmath43 gev ( as suggested by neutrino mass difference measurements ) , and there is a small first / third generation scalar splitting at @xmath16 . an example case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yuk ] .",
    "yukawa unification in the dr3 model ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "if susy is broken in gravity mediation , then one expects the scalar masses to be directly related to the gravitino mass . in this case , @xmath44 tev as well .",
    "this range of @xmath45 solves a major portion of the cosmological gravitino problem : such a heavy gravitino will have a lifetime less than 1 second@xcite , so that it decays just before the onset of bbn .",
    "thus , this model should be bbn safe , and should allow for a re - heat temperature @xmath46 gev . while this @xmath47 value is not enough to sustain thermal leptogenesis as a baryogenesis mechanism , it is enough to sustain non - thermal leptogenesis , wherein right hand neutrinos are produced via inflaton decay , or affleck - dine leptogenesis .",
    "the above mass spectrum predicted by yukawa - unified susy has many desirable features .",
    "however , if we calculate the thermally produced relic abundance of neutralinos ( we use isared@xcite ) , we find @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ 3 - 5 orders of magnitude higher than the measured value@xcite !    at this point , we have totally neglected ( at our peril ! ) the strong @xmath42 problem .",
    "if we invoke the pqww@xcite solution to the strong cp problem with an `` invisible '' axion@xcite , then we must include the axion / axino supermultiplet in the theory .",
    "the qcd axion has mass @xmath49 ev according to astrophysical / cosmological constraints .",
    "the axino @xmath50 is @xmath9-parity odd , and can serve as the lsp@xcite .",
    "its mass is relatively unconstrained , and can span the kev@xmath51 gev range .",
    "if @xmath52 mev range , then @xmath53 with a lifetime typically less than 1 second ( bbn safe )",
    ". each thermally produced neutralino will decay to exactly one axino , and the ( non - thermally produced ) axino abundance will be @xmath54@xcite : the ratio of masses yields a factor @xmath55 , and can completely wipe out the neutralino overabundance .",
    "these decay - produced mev - scale axinos would likely constitute _ warm _ dark matter@xcite .",
    "the axinos can also be produced thermally via scattering off quarks and gluons early on in the cosmic soup .",
    "the abundance depends on the axino mass , the pq breaking scale @xmath56 and the re - heat temperature @xmath47 after inflation@xcite .",
    "the thermally produced axinos will constitute cold dark matter so long as @xmath57 mev .",
    "a third dark matter component comes as usual from vacuum misalignment production of cold axions , as shown by sikivie and others@xcite .",
    "this contribution @xmath58 depends on the pq scale @xmath56 ( or alternatively the axion mass ) and the initial mis - alignment angle @xmath59 .",
    "the total dark matter abundance in the pqmssm model comes from three components : @xmath60 we examined yukawa - unified susy models with both low and high values of @xmath56 and @xmath61@xcite . by enforcing @xmath62 as measured by wmap",
    ", we can extract the required re - heat temperature .",
    "the values of @xmath47 can range easily between @xmath63 gev , thus being in the range required by the gravitino problem , and also allowing for non - thermal or affleck - dine leptogenesis !",
    "the yukawa - unified susy model predicts a rather light gluino with @xmath4 gev . in standard susy models with gaugino mass unification ,",
    "the lep2 limit on @xmath64 gev implies @xmath65 gev , which is somewhat beyond tevatron reach .",
    "however , in yukawa - unified susy , the huge @xmath66 tev parameter feeds into gaugino mass evolution via two - loop rges to suppress the gap between the @xmath67 and @xmath68 gaugino masses @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , in yukawa - unified susy , @xmath71 can be as low as @xmath72 gev while respecting the lep2 chargino limit .",
    "also , the huge first generation squark masses actually _ suppress _ negative interference in the @xmath73 production cross section , thus raising the @xmath74 production cross section at the tevatron by factors of 3 - 10 beyond standard calculations !",
    "finally , the @xmath75 decays nearly 100% of the time via 3-body modes into @xmath27-quarks .",
    "thus , four or more @xmath27-jets are expected in each final state . by requiring @xmath76 or even @xmath77 , sm backgrounds",
    "are highly suppressed .",
    "detailed calculations find a 5 fb@xmath78 reach of tevatron to @xmath79 gev@xcite .",
    "this probes the _ most favored _ portion of yukawa - unified parameter space , since yukawa - unification worsens as @xmath71 increases .",
    "* this search is strongly recommended for cdf and d0 ! *    at the @xmath80 tev lhc , the @xmath81 cross section ranges between 2000 - 6000 fb , and occurs mainly via @xmath82 annihilation .",
    "the events should again be characterized by high @xmath27-jet multiplicity .",
    "in addition , the decay @xmath83 followed by @xmath84 can occur at a large rate . in this case",
    ", the @xmath85 distribution for sf / os dileptons should have a characteristic mass bump followed by an edge at @xmath86 : see fig .",
    "[ fig : mll ] . since this mass gap",
    "is typically bounded by about 90 gev , the bump / edge should sit between the @xmath87 and @xmath88 peaks , and should be easily visible even with very low integrated luminosity @xmath89 fb@xmath78 .",
    "an estimate of the @xmath80 tev lhc reach with just 0.1 fb@xmath78 of integrated luminosity , and not using @xmath90 cuts , is to @xmath79 gev . with 1 fb@xmath78 of integrated luminosity , which is now anticipated in lhc run 1 , the reach using @xmath90 cuts is to @xmath91 gev .",
    "thus , it is expected that lhc will be able to either discover or rule out yukawa - unified susy during its first run at @xmath80 tev ! * this search is strongly recommended for atlas and cms ! *        finally , since a large value of @xmath56 is favored cosmologically , we would expect the axion / axino abundance to be mainly mis - alignment produced axions .",
    "thus , we can anticipate a possible axion discovery by admx@xcite in the years to come , if yukawa - unified susy is correct .",
    "the yukawa - unified susy scenario invokes imo the four greatest ideas in physics beyond the sm : grand unification , supersymmetry , see - saw neutrino masses and the pqww axion solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "yukawa - unified susy with mixed axion / axino cdm also solves several cosmological problems , and is consistent with low energy realizations of the fifth greatest idea : string theory@xcite .",
    "the immediate prediction is a rather light gluino with @xmath4 gev which decays via three - body modes into mainly @xmath27-quarks : it should be observable in the next year or two via tevatron and lhc run 1 data",
    ". a positive signal would also be likely at the admx experiment .",
