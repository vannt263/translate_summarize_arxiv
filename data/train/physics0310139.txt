    "modern synchrotron radiation facilities are able to provide extremely high photon fluxes with an enormous brilliance , which opens up new research fields in many different areas",
    ". one of these branches are fast time - resolved studies .",
    "of special interest are for example dynamical processes in material science @xcite like phase transitions , polymerisation or deformations under stress . in the chemical or biological domain for example muscle contraction @xcite or lipid phase transitions",
    "@xcite come into the focus of interest .",
    "however , the existing x - ray detectors do not offer the time - resolutions needed or are often not capable of dealing with the enormous photon rates produced by insertion devices like wigglers , undulators or in future by free electron lasers , and are the bottleneck of state of the art beamlines . to find a solution for this mismatch one has to improve old detector concepts or to introduce new approaches .",
    "detectors in general can be classified into two categories : integrating detectors and single photon counters .",
    "the performance of integrating devices like ccds ( charge coupled devices ) , image plates or x - ray films , is getting more favourable at high photon flux , since the relative noise contribution is decreasing .",
    "the noise contributions can be attributed to noise caused by fluctuations of the measured quantity related to the input ( _ intrinsic noise _ ) , to _ dark noise _ and to _ readout noise_. the readout noise increases in proportion to the readout frame rate , whereby in most ccds this noise contribution is much larger than the dark noise .",
    "time - resolution is thus competing with intensity precision ; generally , the time - resolution is limited to keep the readout noise contribution relatively small . at some value of input flux the integrator saturates and",
    "can not add up more until the content is reset .",
    "the dynamic range of integrating devices , which is typically @xmath2@xmath3 , is thus limited by noise and saturation level .",
    "in contrast to integrating devices counting detectors like mwpcs ( multi wire proportional chambers ) or msgcs ( micro strip gas chambers ) are not sensitive to noise contributions , described above , as long as this noise level is below the threshold , triggering the counter .",
    "however , one single event implies a dead time , for instance caused by the length of the produced detector signal and the electronic processing , e.g. the readout . due to this dead time",
    "the performance of counting detectors drops at high rates and dead time corrections have to be applied to correct the measured intensities .",
    "especially when counting detectors are used in synchrotron radiation facilities , these corrections can become complicated due to the intrinsic time structure of the photon beam @xcite .",
    "the dynamic range of photon counting devices , typically reaching values of up to @xmath4 , is limited downwards by the number of counts due to false triggers ( noise triggers ) and upwards by the ( inverse ) dead time . to prevent the detector from too high photon rates one has to attenuate the primary beam , and thus the full power of modern synchrotrons",
    "is wasted . due to the low noise level , the high dynamic range and the good time - resolution , which can be approximately in the order of magnitude of the dead time or even better",
    ", single photon counting detectors , e.g. one - dimensional delay - line detectors @xcite , are often used for example in saxs imaging , where only small parallax is obtained due to the small diffraction angles .",
    "however , _ the _ unique detector for every application is not existent and compromises have to be found , optimising the detector for the particular application .",
    "although many efforts have been started to increase the readout speed of integrating ccd cameras , e.g. @xcite , the time - resolution is still limited to about @xmath5 . despite their good spatial resolution and their large number of pixels ccds also suffer from the limited intensity precision of roughly @xmath6 @xcite and the limited dynamic range . on the other hand",
    ", single photon counters can still not deal with the enormous rates offered by synchrotron facilities .",
    "there are new ideas to find solutions to this drawback e.g. with semiconducting pixel array detectors @xcite . with the introduction of micro pattern gaseous devices like msgcs @xcite or gems",
    "@xcite several new approaches have been carried out building faster gaseous detectors , e.g. the rapid ( refined adc per input detector ) system @xcite or a gem pixel detector @xcite , which replace the old detector era of mwpcs .",
    "an overview of micro pattern gaseous detectors can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional single photon counting gaseous detector for x - rays in the energy range of @xmath7@xmath8 , described in this work , represents a concept which is very flexible and can therefore easily be adapted to special requirements .",
    "it offers time - resolutions in the sub - microsecond range and is thus qualified for time - resolved saxs - imaging .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the working principle and the setup of the detector .",
    "detailed information about the detector can be found elsewhere @xcite . a review of a previous , similar detector with smaller sensitive detection area and a less sophisticated position reconstruction , with a different gas gain structure and with slower",
    "electronics and readout has also been published earlier @xcite .",
    "[ fig_schematic ] shows a schematic cross - section of the detector .",
    "the x - ray photons enter the detector through the carbon fibre entrance window and the subjacent @xmath9 thick mylar foil clad with a few micrometer thick carbon layer at the bottom side serving as drift cathode . inside the conversion region between the drift cathode and the ( first ) gas gain structure ( gap of about @xmath10 , which is a compromise between a good photo effect efficiency and moderate parallax ) one single photon produces a few hundred primary electrons in the gas volume , which is typically filled with @xmath11 ( 90/10 ) .    , subdivided into @xmath12 cells (",
    "actually , the readout structure contains @xmath13 cells , whereby the outermost cells are dummy cells ) .",
    "the drift cathode is typically supplied with a voltage of @xmath14 , in combination with the ( not shown ) drift cage providing a homogeneous drift field of @xmath15 .",
    "the readout structure is at ground potential .",
    "the electric field between the individual gems is set to @xmath16 and between the undermost gem and the readout structure to @xmath17.,width=302 ]    since this charge amount is too small to be detected additional amplification is necessary .",
    "for that purpose micro pattern devices like microcat ( micro compteur  trous ) @xcite or gem @xcite have been intensively tested @xcite .",
    "the microcat has many advantages like stable gas gaining at high rates , time stability or an enormous robustness .",
    "nevertheless , we were not successful in finding a suitable spacer concept which should guarantee a constant distance to the subjacent readout anode . therefore , we decided not to use this device . for the gem",
    "an external spacer concept is not necessary and , despite some disadvantages like rate- and time - dependent gas gaining which are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_performance ] , we have decided to use a constellation of three consecutive gems ( triple - gem ) .    after multiplication the charge cluster hits the readout anode , which is realised by an interpolating resistive structure , where the spatial information of the event is determined in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the sensitive area of the readout structure is divided into @xmath18 square cells .",
    "each cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rs ] ) , which has an edge length of @xmath19 and a surface resistance of @xmath20 , is surrounded by better conducting borders with a width of about @xmath21 and a surface resistance of @xmath22 .",
    "the resistive material is printed onto a ceramics or a pcb medium , based on fr4 .",
    "the charge flows to the readout nodes at the corners of the cells , which are connected by small through connections to the backside of the readout structure . by means of linear reconstruction algorithms , e.g. using only the collected charges @xmath23 at the four readout nodes of one cell ( 4-node algorithm ) , the event position can be calculated within the cell . for a proper reconstruction using combinations of several linear algorithms ( 463-node algorithm )",
    "always 9 nodes should be read out @xcite .    due to this interpolating concept",
    "the cells can be subdivided into _ virtual pixels _ ( vip ) and a large sensitive area can be covered , simultaneously reaching a spatial resolution of the order of @xmath24 ( fwhm ) which is nearly two orders of magnitude better than the size of a cell ( this spatial resolution can only be obtained in combination with adequate electronics and a gas gain of about @xmath2 since the spatial resolution is directly proportional to the reciprocal signal to noise ratio @xmath25 ) .",
    "each read out charge is amplified by a charge sensitive amplifier and digitized by a @xmath26 adc ( analog to digital converter ) sampling with a frequency of @xmath27 .",
    "four adc - channels corresponding to one detector cell are placed together at one adc - card , where they are connected to one complex xilinx fpga ( field programmable gate array ) logic device @xcite . via point",
    "to point links the sixteen adc - cards , containing all 64 channels , can communicate with their direct neighbours , while the data / control bus supports the communication with a master card , controlling the data latch to the pc ( fig .",
    "[ fig_schemel ] ) .    together with the signal information a time stamp in terms of a @xmath28- or @xmath29-counter is digitally recorded .",
    "the counter can externally be reset .",
    "additionally , an external signal ( e.g. a linear ramp ) can be digitised by the adc at the master card .",
    "the time information can be used to slice the data after the measurement has been finished .",
    "the digitised data from the adc - cards are stored into a fifo inside the xilinx on the master card , which is connected via optocouplers to a pc using a standard @xmath30 pci - interface .",
    "currently , the transfer in dma - mode can latch data with a speed of @xmath31 into the memory of the pc . by using an alternative pci - card the transfer speed",
    "can even be increased to @xmath32 .",
    "a dedicated software package , written in visual c++ , processes data online , so that the user is directly able to evaluate the running measurements .",
    "the raw data as well as the already processed image histogram can be stored to hard disk .",
    "each event occupies @xmath33 in the raw data file .",
    "each individual gem foil produces a gas gain of about @xmath34@xmath35 , if the gem operation voltage amounts to about @xmath36@xmath37 depending on gas mixture and pressure .",
    "the total gas gain of a triple - gem constellation can easily exceed @xmath2 and stable operation in xenon gas mixtures up to @xmath38 at this gain is possible @xcite .",
    "operation with pressure @xmath39 with high-@xmath40 gases like xenon is not advisable due to a high discharge probability at gains @xmath41 .",
    "the use of the triple - gem for hard x - ray detection ( @xmath42 ) is therefore rather limited .",
    "since the gem technology is well sophisticated and intensively tested also large area gems can be built @xcite and thus large sensitive areas are feasible .",
    "the gain homogeneity over the total area of the triple - gem constellation at uniform illumination is much superior to microcat detectors because no external spacer concept is needed due to the intrinsic constant thickness of the kapton foil and the width of the multiplication gap , respectively .",
    "disadvantageous is the fact that the gem can easily be destroyed by too heavy sparks . to avoid the destruction ,",
    "large area gems should be subdivided to reduce the capacitance of the individual sectors @xcite .",
    "the detector should always be operated in safe voltage and gas gain ranges , if possible .    due to charging up of the kapton",
    ", the gas gain drops as a function of illumination time and rate . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig_rategain ] shows the measured relative gain distribution as a function of the position in the detector during the measurement of a silver behenate diffraction target with high local rates ( cf .",
    "[ sec_agbehenate ] ) . in counting detectors , like the detector presented here ,",
    "a rate- and time - dependence of the gas gain is not relevant as long as the signals do not drop under the trigger threshold .",
    "however , an energy selectivity can not be carried out for inhomogeneous images and due to the decreasing signal - to - noise ratio also the spatial resolution drops in highly illuminated areas .",
    "this has to be compensated by a very high overall gas gain ( which is easily possible with the triple - gem ) but which requires a high dynamic range of analogue and digital electronics . due to the time- and rate - dependent behaviour",
    "the gem can not be used as a preamplification stage in integrating systems , as planned for the microcat device @xcite . to stop the charging of the kapton and thus to keep the gas gain rate- and time - independent a coating of the gem with amorphous carbon",
    "is proposed @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution of the triple - gem then is expected to be in the order of @xmath43 at @xmath1 , which can also be obtained with standard ( uncoated ) gems in homogeneous illumination or single photon spots with constant x - ray flux after an equilibrium state has been reached .",
    "cells of the sensitive area during the measurement of a silver behenate diffraction target . in the high rate diffraction ring area",
    "( within the white dotted lines ) the photon flux is about @xmath44 times higher than in the background ; the gain drops roughly by a factor of @xmath45 ( dark colours).,width=264 ]      in counting detectors one has to make a compromise between high rate capability and spatial resolution . in general",
    "a detector can be optimised to deal with high rates by a very fast shaping of the analogue signals , at the same time , however , losing spatial resolution due to too little collected charge and thus a too small snr .",
    "the most elegant way to avoid these problems is to produce very short intrinsic detector signals , which is one big advantage of micro pattern devices in contrast to mwpcs .",
    "the gem features a very fast signal shape at the anode , which is induced only by electrons .",
    "the about @xmath46-times slower ions do not make any contribution to the signal , which is however the case for other micro pattern devices like microcat or micromegas ( micro mesh gaseous structure ) @xcite . in our detector setup",
    "the raw anode signals have approximately a gaussian shape with a mean length of @xmath47@xmath48 ( fwhm ) for @xmath49 ( 90/10 ) at standard pressure and @xmath11 ( 90/10 ) at a pressure of @xmath50 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the relatively high resistance and capacitance of the sensitive area leads to an integrating @xmath51-element - like behaviour of the readout structure , resulting in a temporal broadening of the input signal ( fig .",

    "[ fig_deadarea ] ) . in this simulation",
    "the reconstruction is carried out with a simple 4-node algorithm , using only the charges collected at the four central nodes .",
    "this is a worst case estimation for two contemporaneous events .",
    "the later the second event appears within the dead time window of the first event the smaller is the distortion . with a typical amplified signal having a length @xmath53",
    "the average detected flux is limited to @xmath54 with less than @xmath55 dead time loss .",
    "this value corresponds to an average detected flux of about @xmath56 for a detector with a cellsize of @xmath57 , which is a true value .",
    "this means , that the global count rate capability is the product of the average detected flux and the total size of the detector .",
    "note that apart from pure pixel devices , a similar principle limitation in local rate capability is found for all interpolating devices , although it is often not explicitly mentioned .",
    "often one finds a mismatch between the global rate capability and the number given for the average detected flux multiplied by the active area of the detector .",
    "this is not the case for the numbers given in this work .",
    "since the arising dead area is always measured in cell units a decrease in cell size leads to a higher average detected photon rate per unit area . by decreasing the cell size for instance to @xmath58 ,",
    "the average detected flux increases by a factor of 16 to @xmath59 . in principle , one is free to adapt the cell size to be able to deal with the desired photon rates .",
    "however , the cell size is limited upwards by the deteriorating spatial resolution and the signal diffusion , which increases nearly proportional to the square of the cell edge length @xmath60 ( this result was obtained by simulations @xcite ) .",
    "decreasing the cell size is limited by the readout speed of the electronics which can not be exceeded . moreover ,",
    "if the cell size is chosen too small ( @xmath61 ) , the advantage of the interpolating readout system vanishes ; in this case , a pure pixel device is much more advantageous and easier to handle . by means of a complex signal recognition",
    "double events may potentially be processed properly in future , which would improve the local rate capability enormously . yet , this feature has not been investigated .",
    "another rather critical point in gaseous avalanche detectors is the influence of space charge produced by the multiplication process  mainly of the slowly drifting ions  , causing spatial reconstruction distortions , because the electrons , drifting from the conversion gap towards the gain regions , are attracted by the ion space charge .",
    "a big advantage of micro pattern devices compared to e.g. mwpcs is the fact , that the amount of ions , drifting back from the multiplication regions to the drift cathode , is relatively small . in case of the triple - gem we have measured an ion feedback @xmath62 @xcite . with special care in choosing the parameters of the gem it should be possible to suppress the ion feedback to less than @xmath63 at a gain of @xmath2 @xcite , but",
    "this has still to be proven experimentally .",
    "for the microcat in combination with the resistive readout structure we have measured no serious degradation in operation due to space charge at photon peak fluxes @xmath64 with a beam collimation of @xmath65 .",
    "also the gem can work with high local fluxes @xcite .",

    "amounts to 100.,width=680 ]      the noise level of the triple - gem detector is around a few counts per seconds over all the sensitive area , as typical for counting detectors . for a @xmath66 virtual pixel interpolation ,",
    "corresponding to a pixel size of @xmath67 , the noise level is far below @xmath68 .",
    "intensity precision is thus , as expected , only poisson - limited and can be better than @xmath69 .",
    "the charge integrating preamplifiers with subsequent shaping , currently in use , have a shaping time of @xmath70 .",
    "they have not been optimised for this application , but were rather built for a mwpc which produces signals with long ion tails . in the future we plan to use a linear transimpedance preamplifier .",
    "the charge collection by current integration can be carried out digitally afterwards in the fpga .",
    "one prototype channel which has already been tested responds to a @xmath71-like input with a gaussian signal shape with a width of about @xmath72 ( fwhm ) due to bandwidth limitations .",
    "the data readout crucially influences the dead time behaviour of the overall system . in a previous version of the electronics @xcite",
    "the data transfer used to be the bottleneck of the readout , which limited the readout speed dramatically and implied additionally an electronic dead time of about @xmath73 per event .",
    "the synchronous readout was triggered by an externally generated signal (  global trigger \" ) which was created by the discriminated signal from the bottom side of the lowermost gem ( or from the microcat , respectively ) .",
    "the newly developed very modular adc system enables a parallel and asynchronous readout of the nine nodes of interest , carrying the most important information of one event .",
    "furthermore , it offers the capability of preprocessing before data are latched to the pc .",
    "the processing is performed by xilinx fpga devices which are freely programmable using a hardware description language like vhdl .",
    "the new system is , for example , able to integrate the current signal , to find the signal peak and to locate the node with the maximum signal and the surrounding 8 nodes autonomously .",
    "furthermore , it can work in a self - triggering mode , i.e. a trigger is generated by a signal recognition unit .",
    "this trigger signal needs not serve as a global but rather as a  local \" trigger which means that only the region of interest is triggered for readout while the neighbouring channels ( at least two cells away ) are not read out and thus work in a normal fashion . during the readout of the 9 nodes of interest the participating adc channels are continuously sampling new data , so that no additional dead time occurs . for the final version of the local trigger programming we expect that the dead time contribution due to the readout is small compared to the signal lengths @xcite .    due to the modularity",
    ", an upgrade of to a larger system can be realised by a replication of the system , described above .",
    "the master cards of these sub - systems have to be connected to an overall - master .",
    "thereby , it should be possible to extend the detector by scaling the sensitive area and the global rate capability at the same time without loss of spatial resolution and local rate capability .",
    "when the number of electronic channels exceeds a certain limit , the whole reconstruction work should be implemented in the fpga logic devices on the system master - card(s ) by making use of the newest generation of fpgas featuring fast multiplier / divider units .",
    "by only transmitting the ( already time - sliced ) histograms instead of the raw data the data transfer to the pc will be compressed by several orders of magnitude .",
    "unfortunately , the measurements , described in this publication , could only be carried out with a  slim \" version , which means that the xilinx devices were programmed with a less complex test mode vhdl programme .",
    "it is still based on a global trigger which is distributed to the whole system by one dedicated adc - channel , that originally used to digitise data at the corner of the sensitive area ( cf .",
    "black dead area in the lower right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig_rattail ] ) . after the trigger has been received by the other adc - cards , the peak sampling point in a defined time window of each channel",
    "is transmitted to the master card that decides which 9 nodes are sent to the pc .",
    "the dead time of this procedure amounts to about @xmath74 .",
    "the local trigger programming is currently under development , and a simple prototype version has already been tested successfully .      with the triple - gem detector and the new digital ( and analogue ) electronics",
    "it seems sensibly feasible to reach continuous time - resolutions in the @xmath48-range ; thereby , the time - resolution is limited by the width of the conversion gap @xmath75 : incoming photons may convert into electrons by photo effect everywhere in this gap ( actually more photons convert directly behind the entrance window compared to positions directly above the gem due to the exponential absorption law ) . by this physical process",
    "the time - resolution is limited by the maximum electron drift time @xmath76 in the conversion gap .",
    "typical values for the electron drift velocity are @xmath77 in xenon - based gas mixtures at standard pressure @xcite .",
    "this means , that the time - resolution is limited to about @xmath78 for a @xmath10 conversion gap .",
    "the drift gap can be chosen smaller , at the same time losing quantum efficiency .",
    "increasing gas pressure to increase efficiency will decrease drift velocity and hence increase the drift time .",
    "maybe the addition of @xmath79 to the xenon mixture can increase the electron drift velocity @xcite .",
    "simulations with the magboltz programme show promising results @xcite .",
    "the limitation of the time - resolution , described above , is actually similar in all gaseous devices where a larger conversion gap is needed to gain sufficient quantum efficiency .",
    "incidentally , the timing structure of the synchrotron beam caused by the individual electron bunches in the storage ring is also lost due to the slower electron drift in the conversion gap ; for elettra or esrf the minimum time difference between two bunches ( with uniform bunch pattern ) amounts to about @xmath80 .",
    "the images , shown in the next subsections , have been recorded with two different readout structures based either on a ceramics or on a printed circuit board ( pcb ) .",
    "both substrates have advantages and disadvantages :    the @xmath81-ceramic medium is very planar and therefore well suited for operation with a microcat gas gain structure .",
