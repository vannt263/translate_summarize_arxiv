    "<S> we study the concept of the fourth skein module of @xmath0-manifolds , that is a skein module based on the skein relation @xmath1 and a framing relation @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 invertible ) . </S>",
    "<S> we give necessary conditions for trivial links to be linearly independent in the module . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the behavior of elements of the skein module under the @xmath6-move and compute the values for @xmath7-torus links and twist knots as elements of the skein module . using the idea of mutants and rotors , we show that there are different links representing the same element in the skein module . we also show that algebraic links ( in the sense of conway ) and closed @xmath0-braids are linear combinations of trivial links . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the concept of @xmath6-algebraic tangles ( and links ) and analyze the skein module for @xmath0-algebraic links . as a byproduct </S>",
    "<S> we prove the montesinos - nakanishi @xmath0-moves conjecture for @xmath0-algebraic links ( including @xmath0-bridge links ) . in the case of classical links ( i.e. links in @xmath8 ) </S>",
    "<S> our skein module suggests three polynomial invariants of unoriented framed ( or unframed ) links . </S>",
    "<S> one of them generalizes the kauffman polynomial of links and another one can be used to analyze amphicheirality of links ( and may work better than the kauffman polynomial ) . in the end , we speculate about the meaning and importance of our new knot invariants .    jzef h. przytycki and tatsuya tsukamoto    in memory of rodica simion ( january 18 , 1955 - january 7 , 2000 ) </S>"
