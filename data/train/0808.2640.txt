    "early - type dwarf galaxies are the most frequent galaxy type in nearby groups and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the information related with their evolution in such environments is codified in their spatial distribution , chemical composition and kinematics , a single scenario including all their properties in a consistent frame is still missing .",
    "the main difficulty resides in the fact that they do not constitute a homogeneous class of objects . among them , there are nucleated and non - nucleated galaxies , as well as systems that were found to harbour discs and spiral structure @xcite .",
    "moreover , central star formation has also been reported in some objects @xcite .",
    "the so called compact elliptical ( ce , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , compact dwarf elliptical ( cde , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or m32-like ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) galaxies are members of the low - luminosity galaxy family , but instead of having low surface brightness like the most common early - type dwarfs , they have notorious high surface brightness ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they constitute a very rare group , as there are many galaxies classified as compact ellipticals ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but only five objects have been confirmed as such , in addition to the prototype m32 .",
    "the known examples are all companions of larger galaxies .",
    "they are m32 itself , a satellite of the m31 ( andromeda ) spiral galaxy ,",
    "ngc4486b close to m87 in the virgo cluster @xcite , ngc5846a close to the giant elliptical ngc5846 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a496ce close to the central cluster dominant ( cd ) galaxy of the cluster abell 496 @xcite , and two objects in the abell 1689 cluster ( cg@xmath6 and cg@xmath7 , * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted that object cg@xmath6 from @xcite , has a quite deviating radial velocity with respect to its closest projected giant elliptical .    in particular",
    ", m32 presents the following characteristics : ( a ) it is a satellite of a larger galaxy ; ( b ) the brightness profile can not be accurately fitted with a single srsic law @xcite ; ( c ) high surface brightness in comparison with ellipticals of the same luminosity @xcite and correspondingly a small size @xcite ; ( d ) a radial change in both age and metallicity , leading however to a quite flat colour profile , its stellar population being younger and more metal - rich at the centre @xcite .",
    "the other confirmed ce galaxies show similar properties with respect to surface brightness , compactness and projected location close to brighter galaxies .",
    "however , there might be some differences in their colour gradients and brightness profiles ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite , regarding ngc4486b ) as well as in metal content and age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some effort has been made to find more examples of these very rare objects in nearby clusters or groups , like fornax @xcite and leo @xcite .",
    "however , all the examined candidates have been rejected as ce galaxies .",
    "as the questions related to their origin and their role in the framework of galaxy evolution remain still open , it would be of great interest to find more objects and to study them in relation to their environment .",
    "the antlia cluster of galaxies is the third nearest well populated galaxy cluster after virgo and fornax .",
    "it exhibits a complex structure consisting of several subgroups , the most conspicuous ones being dominated by the giant elliptical galaxies ngc3258 and ngc3268 .",
    "x - ray observations showed extended emissions around both subgroups @xcite .",
    "these emissions are concentrated towards the dominant galaxies , but extensions elongated in the direction to the other subgroup are also present , suggesting an ongoing merger . @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that the globular cluster systems around ngc3258 and ngc3268 are elongated in the same direction as a connecting line between the two galaxies , resembling the x - ray results .",
    "the photographic survey of @xcite was the first and last major effort devoted to study the galaxy population of the antlia cluster .",
    "they identified , by visual inspection , 375 galaxies that are listed in their antlia group catalogue ( hereafter labelled by the acronym fs90 plus the catalogue number ) .",
    "it gives , among other data , a membership status ( 1 .",
    "definite member , 2 .",
    "likely member , 3 .",
    "possible member ) and a morphological type for each galaxy .",
    "fs90 classified 10 objects as e(m32 ? ) or s0(m32 ? ) , and 1 object as d : e(m32?),n .    given the lack of an extensive analysis of antlia s galaxy population , we initiated the antlia cluster project with the aim at performing the first ccd - photometric and spectroscopic study of this cluster .",
    "in the first paper of this long - term project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we presented photometric properties of the early - type galaxy population . among our results",
    "it was found that early - type members define a tight colour - magnitude relation , spanning 9 mag from giant ellipticals to dwarf galaxies , without a perceptible change of slope .",
    "this slope is similar to those found in other clusters like virgo , fornax , perseus and coma , which are dynamically different to antlia , and it is also consistent with that displayed by the so called ` blue tilt ' of metal - poor globular clusters in ngc4486 .    among the paper",
    "i sample , there were four galaxies classified as ce candidates by @xcite .",
    "two of these objects are spectroscopically confirmed antlia members that seem to be normal low - luminosity early - type galaxies .",
    "the other two are each one close in projection to either one of the dominant galaxies , and are separated from the locus of the early - type members in the luminosity - mean effective surface brightness diagram .",
    "they display some characteristics of ce galaxies , but radial velocities are not available .    in this paper , the second of the antlia cluster project , we present a photometric analysis of four fs90 ce candidates ( namely fs90110 , fs90165 , fs90192 , and fs90208 ) located in the central region of the antlia cluster .",
    "we aim at obtaining photometric evidence in favour of , or against to , these objects being genuine ce galaxies .",
    "given the small number of ce galaxies known to date , any additional members of this class could give important clues on their evolutionary path .",
    "the central question is probably whether they have been dynamically transformed by the interaction with a massive galaxy .    throughout this paper",
    "we will adopt @xmath8 as the antlia distance modulus @xcite , which corresponds to an antlia distance of 35.2 mpc . at this distance 1 arcsec",
    "subtends 170 pc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section[data ] we give information about our photometric data . in section[analysis ] and [ hst ] we present the analysis of the data , and in section[conclusions ] , a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the data set comprises kron - cousins @xmath1 and washington @xmath0 @xcite images obtained with the mosaic camera ( 8 ccds mosaic imager ) mounted at the prime focus of the 4-m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter  american observatory ( ctio ) , during 2002 april 45 .",
    "these images cover the central part of the antlia cluster ( fig.[mosaic ] ) and were used for paper i. one pixel of the mosaic subtends 0.27 arcsec on the sky , which results in a field of view of @xmath9 arcmin@xmath10 ( i.e. about @xmath11 kpc@xmath10 at the antlia distance ) .",
    "the seeing on the @xmath1 image is 1 arcsec and on the @xmath0 image 1.1 arcsec .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "we selected the kron - cousins @xmath1 filter instead of the original washington @xmath12 due to its better transmission at all wavelengths ( @xcite ) . @xmath1 and @xmath12 magnitudes are very similar , with just a very small colour term and zero - point difference ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we have transformed @xmath1 magnitudes into @xmath12 magnitudes by the calibration given in @xcite .    as a supplement to the mosaic observations , we use bessel @xmath2 and @xmath3 images for two fields centred on ngc3258 and ngc3268 , respectively , that have been obtained during 2003 march 27 - 28 with fors1 at the 8-m vlt ut1 ( antu ) telescope ( cerro paranal , chile ) .",
    "these images cover two fs90 ce candidates ( fs90110 and fs90192 ) , are deeper and have higher resolution than those from ctio .",
    "one pixel of this camera subtends 0.2 arcsec on the sky , giving a field of view of 6.8 @xmath14 6.8 arcmin@xmath10 , i.e. 60 @xmath14 60 kpc@xmath15 at the antlia distance .",
    "the seeing on the @xmath2 image is 0.53 arcsec for the ngc3258 field , and 0.54 arcsec for the ngc3268 one .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "in addition , we have combined four f814w band images of 570 sec each , and four f435w band frames of 1340 sec each , obtained from the acs - hst archive and centred on ngc3258 , as well as four images in the same bands and with the same exposure times , centred on ngc3268 ( proposal i d : 9427 , pi : w. harris ) .",
    "the fs90 ce candidates covered by these frames are , once more , fs90110 and fs90192 . in order to make a comparison between these two candidates with a confirmed ce galaxy , we have also combined two images in the f850lp band of 560 sec each of ngc4486b , obtained from the same archive ( proposal i d : 9401 , pi : p. ct ) .",
    "all acs images were processed with the standard calibration pipeline ( calacs+multidrizzle ) , including bias , dark and flat - fielding corrections .",
    "the hst images have a fwhm of 0.1 - 0.12 arcsec , one pixel of the acs camera subtends 0.05 arcsec on the sky , and its field of view is 202 @xmath14 202 arcsec@xmath10 , i.e. 34.3 @xmath14 34.3 kpc@xmath10 at the antlia distance . following @xcite ,",
    "the f850lp was calibrated to the @xmath16 band .",
    "additionally , and adopting the transformation for @xmath17 , the f814w filter was calibrated in cousins @xmath3 band magnitudes , and the f435w filter in johnson @xmath18 band magnitudes .",

    "we show the positions of the two fors1 fields centred on ngc3258 and ngc3268 , respectively .",
    "the open circles indicate the locations of the fs90 ce candidates in the central region of antlia . at the adopted antlia distance , 1 arcmin@xmath1910.2 kpc .",
    "north is up and east to the left.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +      we calculated total @xmath12 magnitudes and @xmath20 colours by numerically integrating the observed brightness profiles of our fs90 ce candidates . to obtain these profiles we applied the task ellipse within iraf @xcite .",
    "for each galaxy , we used the @xmath1 mosaic image to obtain the elliptical apertures to be used also for the @xmath0 image .",
    "these apertures were determined allowing their centres , ellipticities and position angles to vary freely , until their fits became unstable as a consequence of the low surface brightness . at this point ,",
    "the three parameters were fixed in order to extend the isophotal fit as much as possible towards larger radii .",
    "the sky level was determined following the procedure described in paper i.    the central regions of fs90110 , fs90165 and fs90208 were overexposed on the long - exposure images . to include them , we worked with both long- and short - exposure frames following the procedure described in paper i for bright galaxies with overexposed centres ( see also sect.[profiles ] ) .",
    "fs90110 and fs90192 are projected close to ngc3258 and ngc3268 , respectively . as a consequence",
    ", they are embedded within the light of their bright companions . to obtain their brightness profiles , we constructed 2-dimensional models of both dominant galaxies , and subtracted them from the original images . to build these models",
    ", we used the task bmodel within iraf , which creates a 2-dimensional image file containing a noiseless photometric model of a source image .",
    "the models are based on the isophotal analyses previously performed with ellipse .",
    "we chose a spline function for the interpolation which is supposed to give the smallest residuals .    in order to ensure the best quality of our models we performed two sequences of modelling and subtraction",
    "the first models of ngc3258/3268 , built after masking out the neighbouring bright galaxies , served to enable the modelling of the companion galaxies .",
    "these models are then subtracted from the original images , after which we obtain the final models of the dominant galaxies .",
    "the subtraction of these last models for ngc3258 and ngc3268 from the original images provides the frames in which the profiles of fs90110 and fs90192 are measured , following the fitting procedure mentioned above .",
    "the fors @xmath2 images were used to determine the isophotal apertures to be measured also on the fors @xmath3 frames , and single sequences of modelling and subtraction of the dominant galaxies were applied .",
    "the fitting procedure was similar to that performed on the mosaic images .",
    "this is also valid for the acs images .",
    "table[tabla ] lists relevant information about our ce candidates . in the first five columns we show the fs90 number , positions , fs90 morphology , and @xmath21 values .",
    "the next six columns give the photometric results obtained in the washington photometric system .",
    "these are the observed total magnitudes and colours ( not corrected by absorption or reddening ) with uncertainties in parentheses ( obtained as described in paper i ) , the surface brightness of the limiting isophote within which the total magnitude has been calculated , the equivalent radius of the limiting isophote , the mean surface brightness within the effective radius , and the effective radius ( i.e. the radius containing half of the light ) .",
    "the last column gives the heliocentric radial velocities , when available .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,<,^,>,^,<,>,^ , < \" , ]     _ notes.- _ @xmath22 gives the surface brightness of the outermost isophote within which integrated magnitudes and colours are measured .",
    "@xmath23 is the equivalent radius ( @xmath24 ) of that isophote .",
    "@xmath25 is obtained from @xmath26 .",
    "all these values were obtained from ellipse .",
    "figure.[i_110 ] shows a comparison of the mosaic @xmath12 brightness profiles of fs90110 and fs90192 , with the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ones obtained from fors1 and acs , respectively .",
    "the photometric parameters obtained from the vlt @xmath2 and @xmath3 profiles are listed in table[tabla_vi ] .",
    "most of the features observed in the mosaic profiles are confirmed through vlt and hst images , including the ellipticity and position angle variations .",
    "the exception is the ellipse b4 coefficient behaviour in fs90110 , as it does not become positive at @xmath27 arcsec .",
    "the high central surface brightness displayed by fs90110 in the acs profile is noticeable , detected thanks to the low fwhm of these images .    in order to test the values of the @xmath28 srsic indices obtained for the @xmath12 brightness profile ( see sect.[profiles ] ) of fs90110",
    ", we have fitted two coupled general srsic laws to its acs @xmath3 brightness profile , within the equivalent radius range 2.0  11.8 arcsec .",
    "the srsic index n ( i.e. 1/n ) for both components resulting from this new fit ( 1.8@xmath290.2 and 1.25@xmath290.05 for the outer and the inner components , respectively ) , are in quite good agreement with those obtained from the mosaic profile ( see table[ajustes_mosaic ] ) .",
    "we intended to perform a two component fit over the whole useful range of the acs profile , i.e. 0.3  11.8 arcsec , as the innermost 0.3 arcsec are expected to be affected by the seeing .",
    "however , no model could be obtained that properly fitted the whole profile considering an inner cut radius lower than 1.5 arcsec ( @xmath30 2 fwhm ) .",
    "this indicates that two srsic laws can represent the light profile of the galaxy only if the central region is excluded from the fit .",
    "such limitation of srsic profiles could not be avoided by , for example , performing a psf convolution with the model .",
    "+        @xcite have obtained the @xmath3 profile of m32 , which is shown in fig.[i_110 ] with its equivalent radius re - scaled to the antlia distance .",
    "in addition , we have obtained the acs @xmath16 profile of ngc4486b which is also shown re - scaled .",
    "the profiles of fs90110 and m32 look quite similar both in shape and high central surface brightness , albeit the former extends over a larger galactocentric radius .",
    "m32 also displays significant changes both in ellipticity and in position angle @xcite , similar to those found in fs90110 . on the other hand",
    ", ngc4486b is larger than fs90110 and does not show a two component profile , similarly to fs90192 .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite , who fitted a single component srsic law to the profile of ngc4486b .",
    "from the analysis performed in the previous section , we conclude that fs90165 , an spectroscopically confirmed antlia member , can not be considered as a ce galaxy .",
    "it follows fundamental relations of low surface brightness early - type antlia galaxies ( see also paper i ) , is larger than any confirmed ce object , and presents no compact morphology .",
    "it is also located far away in projection from any bright galaxy , and from the central cluster region , a characteristic shared by all confirmed ce galaxies .",
    "its @xmath12 brightness profile is well fitted by a single srsic law along its whole radius range , i.e. it does not show two components .",
    "however , the s0 morphological classification assigned to this galaxy by fs90 is in agreement with the b4 coefficient values that point to disky isophotes , and with the red inner disc found in its @xmath20 colour map and confirmed through unsharp masking .",
    "there are no images from vlt or hst for this object .",
    "certainly , fs90208 is not a ce galaxy either .",
    "it is a confirmed antlia member that follows the same fundamental relations as fs90165 and the rest of low surface brightness early - type galaxies , and it is not compact . besides , it is not close in projection to any bright galaxy and is far from the centre of the cluster .",
    "however , it displays a two component brightness profile and presents important variations in ellipticity and position angle that resemble those shown by m32 @xcite , albeit stronger .",
    "curiously , these variations arise at the same galactocentric radii than those displayed by fs90110 , and behave in a similar way .",
    "fs90 have classified this object as an s0 galaxy , which is in agreement with the two components present in its brightness profile , as well as with the b4 coefficient which indicates that the isophotes are nearly disky .",
    "moreover , a process of unsharp masking reveals what seems to be an inner bar structure , slightly detected with the subtraction of a fixed ellipse model of the galaxy from the mosaic image .",
    "however , a triaxial object in which the axial ratios vary with radius , could also display isophote twisting @xcite .",
    "there is no radial velocity available for fs90192 .",
    "it displays no perceptible colour gradients and , if it was an antlia member , it would be as compact as other ce galaxies .",
    "furthermore , its projected distance to ngc3268 would be smaller than that between ngc4486b and ngc4486 .",
    "although it does not display two components in its brightness profile , it is worth noting that ngc4486b in the virgo cluster presents a single component profile as well and a similar n ( i.e. 1/n ) value .",
    "despite all the interesting features mentioned above , we can not confirm nor rule out that this object is in the background .",
    "it does not follow the early - type antlia members fundamental relations , as it appears shifted towards higher surface brightnesses , fainter magnitudes , or redder colours .",
    "m32 would hold a comparable position on the colour - magnitude diagram if it were placed at the antlia distance . however , fs90192 does not follow the relation between mean effective surface brightness and luminosity defined by the confirmed ces . under the hypothesis that it is a background object",
    ", fs90192 would become an isolated elliptical galaxy of moderate luminosity ( highly unlikely ) , as we have not found any concentration of galaxies in its neighbourhood .",
    "there is no radial velocity available for fs90110 and , as stated in sect.[k - corr ] , it could be a background galaxy placed at @xmath31120 mpc .",
    "however , it seems to be the most firm candidate for a ce galaxy .",
    "if it was an antlia member , its projected separation from ngc3258 would be of the same order as those of m32 from m31 , and ngc5486a from ngc5486 . moreover",
    ", it would be much closer to the dominant galaxy than ngc4486b to ngc4486 , and its effective radius would be smaller than that of ncg5846a .",
    "it presents a high central surface brightness in the brightness profile obtained from the acs image , and its @xmath20 and @xmath32 colour profiles are quite flat , in agreement with what is found for m32 .",
    "its brightness profile shows two components in the equivalent radius range 2  11.8 arcsec , that seems to be described by n @xmath30 1 ( i.e. n @xmath33 1 ) srsic indices .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that such n index for the outer component might be linked to a truncation of the profile @xcite , due to a possible interaction with ngc3258 .",
    "however , such hypothesis should be studied in the light of the confirmed membership status of fs90110 .",
    "furthermore , it would be interesting to test if the outer component of confirmed ce galaxies displaying two components in their brightness profiles , could be fitted by a srsic law with n @xmath30 1 ( n @xmath33 1 ) .",
    "the variation of the ellipticity and position angle vs. radius displayed by fs90110 , resemble those found in m32 .",
    "these changes occur at a galactocentric radius at which the outer component seems to begin to dominate , in agreement with what @xcite found for m32 .",
    "fs90110 is the only fs90 ce candidate that follows the luminosity vs. mean effective surface brightness relation defined by bright ellipticals , which corresponds to the @xcite scaling relation , towards fainter magnitudes , smaller radius , or higher mean effective surface brightness .",
    "it also seems to follow the antlia members colour - magnitude relation , though it is located at the red border .",
    "the elongation and twisting of fs90110 s outermost isophotes in the direction of ngc3258 are noticeable .",
    "that would be consistent with the extremely low surface brightness structure detected in the mosaic images , and confirmed with the fors1 and acs frames",
    ". such kind of ` bridge ' that seems to link fs90110 with its bright partner , would be in agreement with the fact that most confirmed ce galaxies are located in the vicinity of brighter companions . in that sense , it is also remarkable the warped inner structure displayed in the acs colour map , and confirmed through unsharp masks of fors1 .",
    "quite similar stellar structures are found in numerical simulations @xcite as a consequence of galaxy interactions .",
    "a galaxy that is interacting with a more massive partner will feel tidal forces most strongly in its outskirts , while its central region will be less affected ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * for a model of the interaction between m32 and m31 ) . as a consequence , it would not be surprising to observe asymmetric and ` egg - shaped ' outer isophotes , or / and detect low surface brightness stellar ` tails ' , arising from the disruption of the outer regions of the satellite @xcite .",
    "in particular , these faint structures could be observed either like one or two symmetric ` tails ' , depending on projection effects ( see fig.4 in * ? ? ?",
    "the distorted outermost isophotes of fs90110 , and the extremely faint structure detected in the hst , vlt and ctio images fit quite well in such a scenario .",
    "the similarities in the ellipticity and position angle variations against radius displayed by fs90110 and fs90208 , which arise at a similar galactocentric radius of @xmath34 arcsec ( i.e. in their inner regions ) , are also remarkable . these kind of variations",
    "have already been detected in m32 , although not so strongly .",
    "all these pieces of evidence lead us to speculate about the possibility that , an object similar to fs90208 might be the progenitor of a ce galaxy .",
    "thus , it is tempting to look for possible links between these two kind of objects .",
    "we may think that a system with similar characteristics as fs90208 may lose its outermost regions due to the interaction with a bright companion , then becoming compact . as a consequence ,",
    "it could also experience a redistribution of its stellar content , that might produce a warped inner structure , a higher central surface brightness , and an attenuation of its ellipticity and position angle variations with radius .",
    "moreover , the bulge - to - disc ratio in such object could increase after losing its outer parts due to the interaction . with regard to this point",
    ", it should be noted that the inner component of fs90110 seems to be 3 times brighter than the outer one , while that of fs90208 is just 1.6 times brighter in relation with the outer component .    as an aditional point",
    ", we recall that the antlia cluster seems to be particularly rich in s0 galaxies and fs90208 seems to be one of them .",
    "if the evolutionary path of ce galaxies include this kind of objects , s0 rich clusters would arise as favorable environments for the formation of compact galaxies .",
    "dynamical simulations and the spectroscopically confirmed membership status of fs90110 and fs90192 , will help to test if any of the above statements is indeed plausible .",

    "<S> continuing our study of galaxy populations in the antlia cluster , we present a photometric analysis of four galaxies classified as compact elliptical ( ce ) galaxies in the ferguson & sandage ( 1990 , hereafter fs90 ) antlia group catalogue . </S>",
    "<S> only 6 members of this rare type of galaxies are known until now . using data in various photometric systems ( washington @xmath0 , kron - cousins @xmath1 , bessel @xmath2 and @xmath3 , hst @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , we measured brightness and colour profiles , as well as structural parameters . by comparing them with those of other galaxies in the antlia cluster , as well as with confirmed ce galaxies from the literature </S>",
    "<S> , we found that two of the fs90 ce candidates , albeit being spectroscopically confirmed antlia members , are not ce galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , one of these objects presents strong ellipticity and position angle variations that resemble those already reported for m32 , leading us to speculate about this kind of objects being progenitors of ce galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the other two fs90 ce candidates , for which radial velocities are not available , match some features typical of ce galaxies like being close in projection to a larger galaxy , displaying flat colour profiles , and having a high degree of compactness . </S>",
    "<S> only one of the remaining ce candidates shows a high central surface brightness , two components in its brightness profile , distinct changes in ellipticity and position angle where the outer component begins to dominate , and seems to follow the same trend as other confirmed ce galaxies in a luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness diagram . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it shows a distorted inner structure with similar characteristics to those found by simulations of interacting galaxies , and an extremely faint structure that seems to link this object with one of the antlia dominant galaxies , has been detected in mosaic - ctio , fors1-vlt , and acs - hst images . </S>",
    "<S> the ce nature of this galaxy as well as the possible interaction with its bright companion , still have to be confirmed through spectroscopy .    </S>",
