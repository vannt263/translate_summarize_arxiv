    "the 21  cm line is a powerful tool for studying the atomic interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the first detections of emission and absorption at 21  cm date back to the 1950s ( @xcite for emission , and @xcite for absorption ) . the 21  cm line has been observed extensively since then , and proved extremely valuable in revealing many properties of the milky way galaxy , including the vertical and radial distribution and warp of the atomic disk , the galactic rotation curve and dark matter distribution , and spiral structure .",
    "in addition to large - scale properties of the milky way , 21  cm observations provide a wealth of knowledge regarding the detailed physical state of the interstellar medium ( see reviews including and references therein ) .",
    "recently , the combined leiden - argentine - bonn survey ( lab survey , ) produced a high - sensitivity 21  cm emission map over the entire sky with 36 arcmin resolution by merging the leiden - dwingeloo survey @xcite with the instituto argentino de radioastronoma survey . this high - sensitivity , single - dish survey with stray radiation correction enables highly detailed investigation of in the milky way .",
    "information about the thermodynamic state of hydrogen can be obtained from emission / absorption line pairs , which yield the excitation temperature ( a.k.a .",

    "since the available radio continuum background sources are generally weak at 21  cm , the line profile toward a continuum source gives a mixture of emission and absorption by . in order to separate emission and absorption ,",
    "emission contributions must be estimated from off - source measurements with sufficient spatial resolution . using the largest single dish telescope , the arecibo telescope ( beamwidth of 3.2 arcmin ) ,",
    "@xcite have investigated the emission / absorption line pairs toward continuum sources at high and intermediate latitudes , but the resolution from a single dish is not sufficient for accurate interpolated emission at latitudes below @xmath11 .",
    "interferometric surveys including the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps , @xcite ) , the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps , @xcite ) , and the vla galactic plane survey ( vgps , @xcite ) achieve angular resolution about @xmath121 arcmin . in order to overcome inherent low sensitivity of interferometric observations to extended structures ( zero - spacing ) ,",
    "these new surveys apply short - spacing corrections from single dish observations , allowing accurate measurement of the expected emission and hence absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "the resulting emission / absorption line pairs in these galactic plane surveys reveal a pervasive multiphase structure in the atomic ism out to a galactocentric radius of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "using emission / absorption line pairs , the total atomic column density and the harmonic mean spin temperature on a given line - of - sight ( los ) can be derived with a simple radiative transfer calculation ( * ? ? ?",

    "in classical models of the neutral ism , two distinct phases are expected : the cold neutral medium ( cnm ; @xmath14 ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ; @xmath15 ) , in pressure equilibrium with each other ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the wnm is optically thin at 21  cm due to its low density and high temperature , a simple single temperature approximation for radiative transfer would be satisfied if there is no overlap between cnm clouds within narrow velocity channels .",

    "in addition , we can address a puzzle that has emerged from recent deep , high - resolution interferometric observations toward radio loud quasars @xcite , in combination with the lab survey .",
    "these observations have sufficient sensitivity to detect absorption by the wnm , as in @xcite . using emission / absorption line pairs , @xcite reported a threshold column density at @xmath17 , below which the mean spin temperature exceeds @xmath18 .",
    "they speculated that this apparent threshold might represent a minimum column density for cnm to develop due to self - shielding against ultraviolet photons .",
    "however , detailed modeling of interstellar radiation sources have suggested that the ionization fraction remains small for the hydrogen density of @xmath19 when the absorbing wnm column density exceeds @xmath20 for solar neighborhood condition ( see figure  3(c ) in @xcite ) . in addition ,",
    "absorption lines with a low optical depth and a narrow line width have been detected , implying a very low cnm column density of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown that the ratio of ( integrated ) emission to absorption is nearly constant over the radial distance range of 10 to 25 kpc , whereas the emission and absorption alone decrease by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this implies that the mass fraction of the cnm is unchanged , while the total column density drops by more than an order of magnitude , lower than @xmath22 .    here",

    "a given midplane pressure implies a minimum column of gas ; here , we shall show that this can give rise to a threshold column behavior similar to that seen in observations .",

    "we shall show that the mock observations reproduce 21  cm line observations very well for individual velocity channels @xcite as well as integrated over velocity @xcite .",
    "in addition , we show that the threshold column density is well reproduced , and consistent with the expectation of the thermal / dynamical model .",
    "in this paper , we utilize recent three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of multiphase , turbulent galactic disks presented in paper  i to investigate synthetic 21  cm lines .",
