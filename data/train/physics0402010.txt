    "<S> recent experiments with ultracold neutral plasmas show an intrinsic heating effect based on the development of spatial correlations . we investigate whether this effect can be reversed , so that imposing strong spatial correlations could in fact lead to cooling of the ions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that cooling is indeed possible . </S>",
    "<S> it requires , however , a very precise preparation of the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanical zero - point motion sets a lower limit for ion cooling .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , ultracold ( @xmath0 k ) neutral plasmas could be realized only recently by photoionizing a cloud of ultracold atoms @xcite . from a plasma physics perspective , they are very appealing since they might provide laboratory realizations of so - called strongly coupled plasmas , where the coulomb interaction ( inversely proportional to the mean inter - particle spacing @xmath1 ) dominates the random thermal motion ( proportional to the temperature @xmath2 ) . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> interesting ordering phenomena such as coulomb crystallization can be observed . in order to be in this strong - coupling regime , </S>",
    "<S> a system has to be either very dense ( large coulomb interaction ) or very cold ( little thermal energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first scenario is realized in some astrophysical contexts , which are difficult to access experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the possibility to realize a strongly coupled plasma in the laboratory by going to ultralow temperatures offered exciting prospects within the plasma physics community . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> an ultracold neutral plasma has been created by photoionizing a gas of laser - cooled xe atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the extremely low temperatures of the xe gas suggested that the system was well within the strong - coupling regime , the so - called _ coulomb coupling parameter _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , i.e.  the ratio of potential to thermal energy , being of the order of @xmath4 for the electrons and even up to @xmath5 for the ions .    however , it was realized quickly @xcite that despite the low temperature of the xe gas a strongly coupled plasma could not be created in this way . due to the fact that the neutral xe atoms initially present interact only very weakly , the plasma is created in a completely uncorrelated non - equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the subsequent conversion of potential into kinetic energy rapidly heats both the electron and ion subsystem , suppressing the development of substantial correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been termed `` disorder - induced heating '' @xcite or `` correlation - induced heating '' @xcite , expressing the fact that it is the development of spatial correlations during the relaxation of the plasma towards an equilibrium state which leads to an increase in temperature . put another way , in the initial non - equilibrium state the potential energy is higher than in the corresponding equilibrium state of a plasma of the same average density . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium will reduce the potential energy in the system and increase the kinetic energy , i.e.  the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the electrons are heated by three - body recombination as well as continuum lowering . suppression of electron heating is thus much more difficult than simply reducing the correlation heating . at present </S>",
    "<S> , there is a proposal of mixing the plasma with a gas of rydberg atoms , so that collisional ionization of these rydberg atoms removes energy from the electron component of the plasma @xcite .    for the creation of a strongly coupled ionic component , different procedures </S>",
    "<S> have been suggested to avoid these heating effects , namely ( _ i _ ) using fermionic atoms cooled below the fermi temperature in the initial state , so that the fermi hole around each atom prevents the occurence of small interatomic distances @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) an intermediate step of exciting atoms into high rydberg states , so that the interatomic spacing is at least twice the radius of the corresponding rydberg state @xcite ; and ( _ iii _ ) the continuous laser - cooling of the plasma ions after their initial creation , so that the correlation heating is counterbalanced by the external cooling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , none of these procedures has been realized experimentally , however it has been shown theoretically that continuous laser - cooling can indeed lead to a strongly coupled plasma , connected with crystallization of the expanding system @xcite . in this case , the correlation heating effect is still present and is offset by an additional external cooling mechanism . proposals ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) , on the other hand , aim at suppressing the heating directly by avoiding the small interparticle distances leading to a large potential energy , i.e.  by introducing ( spatial ) correlation in the initial state . as has already been noted in @xcite , this </S>",
    "<S> could also be achieved using optical lattices to arrange the atoms .    at this point , </S>",
    "<S> the question arises naturally whether the correlation heating could not only be avoided , but whether it can actually be reversed and turned into cooling . </S>",
    "<S> as argued above , correlation heating describes the fact that the uncorrelated ions created in the photoionization process have a higher potential energy than in the thermodynamical equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , equilibration will reduce the potential energy and increase the kinetic energy of the system , making the ions hotter than the atoms in the initial gas state . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it is conceivable that the atomic gas might be prepared in an `` overcorrelated '' state , where the potential energy is lower than its equilibrium value . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , equilibration must increase the potential energy on the cost of the kinetic energy , i.e.  the temperature must _ </S>",
    "<S> decrease_. this effect of `` correlation cooling '' has been described before in @xcite and , based on a kinetic approach , in more general terms in @xcite . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the overcorrelated initial state was achieved by suddenly decreasing the debye screening length , i.e.  the temperature of the electrons , rather than by inducing spatial order . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that in this way , a reduction in temperature of the order of a few percent does indeed occur for the temperatures and densities considered .    in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> , we explore an alternative scheme for achieving correlation cooling , namely the use of an optical lattice to induce spatial correlations in the initial state as suggested in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we describe , both analytically and by molecular dynamics simulations , the situation of a fully ordered initial state where the atoms have been arranged in a perfect bcc - type lattice structure using an optical lattice . in reality </S>",
    "<S> , their spatial distribution will be broadened , classically due to their non - vanishing kinetic energy corresponding to the initial - state temperature , quantum mechanically corresponding to the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator potential generated by the optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this broadening is neglected in our numerical simulations , however , its influence will be discussed in the analytical considerations below . for the sake of numerical simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , our initial state corresponds to a sphere cut out from a bcc lattice rather than a more realistic cylindrical shape , arguing that edge effects should be of minor importance if the number of atoms in the system is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> the system is propagated using the hybrid molecular dynamics method described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , an adiabatic approximation is employed for the electrons , and their distribution is obtained from the steady - state king distribution @xcite , widely used in the study of globular clusters . the ions are then propagated using the electronic mean - field obtained from the steady - state distribution and by fully taking into account the ion - ion interactions . in the experiments under consideration , quasineutral plasmas with @xmath6 as low as @xmath7 @xcite have been realized , making debye screening effects negligible , while ion numbers @xmath8 up to @xmath9 have been obtained @xcite . for our simulations , such a large particle number would lead to a prohibitively large numerical effort . </S>",
    "<S> however , the typical timescale for the plasma expansion is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the einstein frequency in the wigner - seitz model of a coulomb solid and @xmath12 is the ion mass . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation of the ions takes place on a timescale of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the same macroscopic behavior can be obtained by decreasing @xmath8 and increasing @xmath6 , keeping the ratio @xmath14 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for our simulations we chose @xmath15 and an initial electron energy corresponding to @xmath16 , while the bare coulomb potential was used for the ion - ion interaction .    figure [ fig1](a ) shows the time evolution of the average ion kinetic energy in units of the initial - state temperature for a typical realization . </S>",
    "<S> since the initial lattice configuration produces an effective oscillator potential for each ion , the relaxation process is connected with transient oscillations of the kinetic energy which are damped out due to ion - ion collisions . additionally , the average kinetic energy increases at later times due to a radial ion acceleration caused by the thermal electron pressure , which is proportional to the density gradient . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the slow expansion of the unconfined plasma leads to a softening of the initially sharp plasma edge and a modification of the velocity distribution in the outer region of the plasma only . </S>",
    "<S> since this distribution is close to a maxwellian in the central region of the plasma , the average kinetic energy is directly related to the ionic temperature @xmath2 , while it becomes more and more dominated by the expansion energy towards the edge of the plasma . in order to highlight these edge effects , </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the average ion kinetic energy from the velocity distribution in the inner region only , taken to be a sphere with half of the initial plasma radius . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting curve is shown as the dashed line in figure [ fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the expansion hardly affects the kinetic energy in the inner region of the plasma , leaving only the oscillations which are damped out as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium . as discussed above </S>",
    "<S> , the relaxation of the ions towards equilibrium takes place on a timescale of @xmath17 , while the typical timescale for the plasma expansion is @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a sufficiently large number of ions allows for an almost unperturbed relaxation in the inner plasma region so that a temperature can be defined in a meaningful way . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a strontium plasma with a typical density of @xmath19@xmath20 used , e.g. , in @xcite , @xmath21s , while @xmath22 is about @xmath23 times larger for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . ) using the absorption imaging techniques described in @xcite it should be possible experimentally to probe this inner region only . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we chose to define the final temperature as given by the inner plasma region and to neglect the finite - size effects associated with the boundary region of the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath26 was estimated from the center of the remaining oscillations and is shown in figure [ fig1](b ) as a function of @xmath27 by the full circles . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the value of @xmath27 has no meaning as a measure of nonideality of the initial plasma state , since the system may be far from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the present case it should simply be viewed as a density - scaled inverse temperature rather than a coulomb coupling parameter . as can be seen in the figure , the ratio of final to initial temperature reaches a constant value of about 0.5 as the initial temperature goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> hence , cooling can indeed be achieved on a moderate level of a temperature reduction of about 50 percent .    for large particle numbers and </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath28 is small enough such that three - body recombination and debye screening can be neglected , quasineutrality leads to a homogeneous electron background in the central plasma region . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can use the one - component plasma model to gain more insight into the cooling process . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been studied extensively over the last decades @xcite , which led to a detailed understanding of the equation of state over a wide parameter range . in the classical regime , </S>",
    "<S> the energy per particle of the final equilibrium state is given by @xmath29 where the excess energy @xmath30 accounts for nonideal effects due to the inter - particle coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for this quantity , several fit formulae can be found in the literature , which have been obtained by monte carlo and molecular dynamics methods @xcite . in the fluid phase we use the interpolation formula from @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq2 ] ) satisfies the known small-@xmath35 limit @xcite and accurately fits the high-@xmath35 values obtained by numerical calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the solid phase ( @xmath36 ) , the excess energy can be described by an expansion in powers of @xmath37 @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the first term corresponds to the madelung energy of the lattice , with @xmath42 for a bcc - type lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the second term describes thermal contributions corresponding to an ideal gas of phonons while the higher - order terms account for anharmonic corrections . </S>",
    "<S> assuming an unchanged ionic phase - space distribution function directly after the photoionization , where the spatial distribution due to the finite temperature is represented by gaussian profiles centered on the sites of the bcc lattice , the internal energy of the initial nonequilibrium state is given by @xmath43 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath44 , with @xmath45 for a bcc lattice . while the first two terms correspond to the ion kinetic energy and the madelung energy of a bcc lattice of point charges , the last two terms give the leading - order corrections due to a broadened charge distribution at the lattice sites expanded in terms of the mean - squared ion displacement @xmath46 . assuming an initially non - interacting atomic gas and harmonic trapping potentials we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the oscillation frequency of the trapping potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the final temperature is now simply obtained from energy conservation @xmath49 with @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1](b ) shows the ratio @xmath54 as a function of @xmath27 for @xmath55 , i.e.  for a point - like ionic density at the lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with our numerical data shows that equation ( [ eq6 ] ) reproduces the numerical values for a finite - size plasma quite well . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining discrepancies should be attributable to finite - size effects @xcite . at small values of @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> the temperature ratio starts out from unity and decreases with increasing @xmath27 , since the excess potential energy of the final fluid state is naturally larger than that of the initial lattice configuration . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath27 exceeds a value of @xmath56 the temperature ratio rises linearly , connected with a solidification of the plasma , where @xmath57 stays constant ( see inset ) . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> regions of fluid and solid phases coexist in the plasma . at @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> the system has crossed the melting point and the temperature ratio approaches a value of @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> this factor of @xmath59 originates from the additional thermal energy of @xmath60 arising from thermal lattice excitations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the situation changes if a finite extension of the initial charge distribution at the lattice sites is considered . neglecting terms of order @xmath61 in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that for finite @xmath48 the temperature approaches a value of @xmath62 if @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to the question of the influence of possible lattice defects , i.e.  how perfect must the initial - state lattice be in order to observe correlation cooling ? </S>",
    "<S> such defects are easily accounted for in the previous consideration . introducing a filling factor @xmath64 , defined as the probability that a given lattice site is occupied </S>",
    "<S> , simply reduces the average charge at each lattice site . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the potential energy of the initial state can be written as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 corresponds to the temperature scaled by the density of the perfectly filled lattice , which is related to the actual value of @xmath27 by @xmath67 . substituting this in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> yields @xmath68 as the generalization of equation ( [ eq6 ] ) to non - perfect filling . in figure [ fig2](a ) , we show the resulting final temperature as a function    of the filling factor for two different @xmath27 . a decreasing filling enhances the initial potential energy ( compared to that of a full lattice with the same average _ density _ , _ not _ the same _ lattice constant _ ) , leading to a rapid increase of the final temperature . as a consequence , cooling can be achieved for a nearly perfect lattice only . furthermore , for a fixed @xmath69 , increasing @xmath27 leads to larger values for the temperature ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this heating also influences the possibility of the creation of a crystallized plasma phase , since the melting point of @xmath57 is shifted to larger values of @xmath27 , as shown in the phase diagram figure [ fig2](b ) . for values of @xmath70 , the system always ends up in the fluid phase independent of @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above picture suggests that , for a perfect initial state , cooling is always possible independent of the initial temperature . at low enough temperatures , however , </S>",
    "<S> the classical treatment will break down , and quantum mechanical effects will become important . as in the classical case </S>",
    "<S> the quantum statistical internal energy of a coulomb solid is of the order of 10000 , i.e.  well within the crystallized regime . ] </S>",
    "<S> can be written as a sum of the madelung energy , harmonic contributions arising from linear lattice excitations and anharmonic corrections . </S>",
    "<S> for the harmonic contributions to the excess energy we use an analytic approximation formula obtained recently @xcite , which reproduces the numerical results for harmonic coulomb crystals very accurately . </S>",
    "<S> the anharmonic corrections are taken from @xcite , where they were obtained by fitting the results of quantum monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expression is too lengthy to be reproduced here , but incorporates both the known semiclassical high - temperature limit as well as the quantum mechanical groundstate energy of a coulomb crystal , @xmath71 here , @xmath72 measures the importance of quantum effects , i.e.  zero - point ion oscillations , and @xmath73 is the wigner - seitz radius in units of the ionic bohr radius . as in the previous classical considerations , we apply a sudden approximation assuming an unchanged density matrix directly after the photoionization pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the initial energy of the plasma is thus found from the expectation value of the new hamiltonian using a density matrix representing independent harmonic oscillators arranged on a bcc lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the result is @xmath74\\ ; , \\ ] ] which exactly corresponds to the classical expression equation ( [ eq4 ] ) except that the kinetic energy @xmath75 is replaced by its quantum mechanical counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the mean - squared displacement is now given by @xmath76 rather than equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , where @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the final temperature is again obtained by equating the initial and final energies of the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] shows @xmath78 as a function of    @xmath27 for @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the classical case , here the final temperature can not be decreased to arbitrarily low values , rather it approaches a finite constant value as @xmath80 , since the initial charge distributions at the lattice sites have a finite extension at @xmath81 due to zero - point oscillations . using the low - temperature limit equation ( [ eq8 ] ) as an estimate for the final energy and neglecting terms of order @xmath82 in the resulting energy balance , this limiting temperature is found to be @xmath83 where @xmath84 . since @xmath85 independent of @xmath86 , </S>",
    "<S> the limiting temperature is always positive and takes on a minimum value of @xmath87 at an optimum ratio of @xmath48 and @xmath88 of @xmath89 note , however , that the limiting temperature obtained numerically with the full expression for @xmath90 is slightly smaller since at finite temperature the system will not be in the groundstate , hence its potential energy is somewhat larger than that given by equation ( [ eq8 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we may rewrite equation ( [ eq12 ] ) as @xmath91}\\stackrel{r_{\\rm s } \\gg1}{\\longrightarrow}7.424r_{\\rm s}^{-1/4}$ ] , where @xmath92 is the thermal debroglie wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> this would suggest that it is possible to reach the degenerate regime of @xmath93 if @xmath86 can be decreased sufficiently , i.e.  to a value @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> even for hydrogen this would correspond to an unrealistically large density of @xmath95@xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the value of @xmath86 enters the ratio @xmath97 with a power of @xmath98 only , so that values of @xmath99 can already be reached if @xmath100 , corresponding to a density of @xmath101@xmath96 , which has already been surpassed with cold bose - condensed hydrogen atoms @xcite . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the present considerations will not hold , since effects of particle statistics will be important which have not been included in the above expressions for the energies . however , equation ( [ eq12 ] ) might serve as an estimate for the parameter values necessary to reach the degenerate regime .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have discussed the possibility of correlation cooling and of the creation of a strongly coupled ultracold neutral plasma by photoionization of a highly ordered state of cold atoms , achievable with optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> classical considerations have shown that the initial temperature can be reduced by a factor of two if the atomic sample is noninteracting initially , offering the possibility to reach ion temperatures which have not been achieved so far . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum regime has been investigated using existing expressions for the equilibrium internal energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> here it was found that the final temperature approaches a constant value which arises from zero - point oscillations in the lattice potentials and depends on the density as well as the geometry of the optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> an almost perfect lattice is necessary to observe the discussed cooling effects , since even a small amount of lattice defects largely increases the final temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been demonstrated that it is possible to create regular structures with a well - defined number of atoms localized in the potential wells of an optical lattice @xcite .    financial support from the dfg through grant ro1157/4 is gratefully acknowledged . </S>"
