    "over the past years , massive amounts of dust and gas have been detected in distant quasars , allowing to study the properties of molecular gas in the early epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "molecular gas in high  redshift galaxies is commonly traced by co emission and was found in @xmath730 galaxies at @xmath8 to date , out to the highest redshift quasar , sdssj1148 + 5251 at @xmath9 ( walter  @xcite , @xcite ; bertoldi  @xcite ) .",
    "the observed molecular gas masses in excess of 10@xmath10provide the requisite material for star formation ( sf , e.g.  solomon & vanden bout @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of abundant molecular gas , the fuel for sf , has led to the hypothesis that the tremendous far  infrared ( fir ) luminosities ( @xmath11 ) of these high  redshift objects are not only powered by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) but also by major starbursts ( sbs ) , suggesting that this population represents the formation of large spheroidal galaxies beyond redshift 2 ( blain @xcite ) .",
    "however , the relative contribution to the fir luminosity from dust heated by sf and agn activity in high@xmath1 sources remains subject to discussion ( e.g.  andreani  @xcite ) .",
    "while the lower@xmath12 transitions of co are a good indicator for the total molecular gas content of a system ( e.g.  carilli @xcite , @xcite ; riechers  @xcite ) , they can be excited at relatively low densities ; the critical density lies at only @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "hence , it is a relatively poor tracer of the denser gas directly involved in massive star formation .",
    "the standard tracer of the dense molecular gas phase is hcn , and the critical density to excite its lower@xmath12 transitions is @xmath15 @xmath14 ( due to a higher dipole moment in comparison to co ) . in this context",
    ", recent studies of the dense molecular gas phase in local ( @xmath16 ) luminous and ultra  luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs / ulirgs ) have shown a correlation between the hcn luminosity and the star  formation rate ( sfr ) as traced by the fir luminosity .",
    "this correlation is much tighter than that between the co and fir luminosities ( solomon  @xcite ; gao & solomon @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , observations of hcn towards high@xmath1 sources hold the potential to pin down the contribution of sf to the total fir luminosity . unfortunately , emission lines from hcn in lirgs / ulirgs are typically by a factor of 4 to 10 fainter than those of co ( even a factor of 2540 in ordinary spiral galaxies , gao & solomon @xcite ) , which hinders systematic hcn surveys at cosmological distances using current telescopes . until today",
    ", deep observations of hcn at @xmath8 resulted in four detections and four upper limits ( solomon @xcite ; vanden bout  @xcite ; carilli @xcite ; wagg  @xcite ) .    due to the faintness of emission connected with thermally excited rotational transitions of hcn",
    ", it is important to investigate whether another physical process can be found which produces emission lines with significantly higher luminosities .",
    "the 183ghz @xmath17 emission line of para ",
    "h@xmath6o holds the potential to be such a tracer : in warm , dense sf regions ( @xmath18@xmath14 ) , this line is collisionally pumped at relatively low kinetic temperatures ( @xmath19k , e.g. cernicharo  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to compact h@xmath6o maser sources at 22ghz , the 183ghz maser emission is spatially extended in high  mass ( orion , cernicharo @xcite ; w49n , gonzlez - alfonso  @xcite ; sgrb2 , cernicharo  @xcite ) and even low  mass ( hh711 , cernicharo  @xcite ) star  forming regions .",
    "due to maser amplification , the observed 183ghz  line brightness temperatures in these regions exceed those observed in  by up to a factor of 20 ( e.g.  for orion , cernicharo @xcite ; schulz  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the  line is strongly absorbed by the terrestrial atmosphere , rendering detection in nearby galaxies very difficult .",
    "the first successful extragalactic detection of  has been reported in ngc3079 ( humphreys  @xcite ) .",
    "previous searches in low@xmath1 ( u)lirgs have only resulted in upper limits ( combes @xcite ) . recently , the  transition has also been detected towards arp220 ( cernicharo , pardo & weiss 2006 , in prep .",
    ", see table 1 ) . at high redshift ,",
    "only the @xmath20 transition of para ",
    "h@xmath6o at 752.033ghz ( rest frame ) has tentatively been detected in the @xmath21 qso irasf10214 + 4724 ( encrenaz  @xcite ; casoli @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a search for maser emission from the 183ghz water line in the strongly lensed , radio  loud @xmath22 qso mg0751 + 2716 using the vla . due to its strong magnification ,",
    "mg0751 + 2716 is the brightest co source at high redshift that can be observed in the  transition with the vla .",
    "its @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see table 1 ) are comparable to local starburst galaxies like arp220 .",
    "this suggests that this source is undergoing massive star ",

    "we use a standard concordance cosmology throughout , with @xmath25mpc@xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( spergel  @xcite ) .",
    "we observed the  transition ( @xmath29ghz ) towards mg0751 + 2716 using the vla in d configuration on 2004 june 19 and 27 . at the target @xmath1 of 3.200 , this transition is redshifted to 43.6453ghz ( 6.87 mm ) .",
    "the total on  sky integration time amounts to 16hr .",
    "observations were performed in fast  switching mode using the nearby source 0745 + 241 for secondary amplitude and phase calibration .",
    "observations were carried out under good weather conditions with 26 antennas .",
    "the phase stability in all runs was good ( typically @xmath3025@xmath31 rms for the longest baselines ) . for primary flux calibration , 3c286",
    "was observed during each run .",
    "two 50mhz ( corresponding to 344  at 43.6ghz ) intermediate frequencies ( ifs ) were observed simultaneously in the so  called quasi  continuum mode .",
    "one if was centered on the line frequency at 43.6351ghz ( closest possible tuning frequency , offset by @xmath3270  from the  line center of barvainis  @xcite ) , and the second if was centered at two frequencies symmetrically offset by 150mhz ( 1030 , i.e.  at 43.4851ghz and 43.7851ghz ) from the line frequency to monitor the 7 mm continuum of mg0751 + 2716 simultaneously . despite the small offset from the line center , the frequency / velocity coverage is well  matched to a line with a fwhm similar to the  line reported by barvainis ( @xcite ) .    for data reduction and analysis ,",
    "the @xmath33 package was used .",
    "the two continuum channels were concatenated in the uv / visibility plane .",
    "the data were mapped using the clean algorithm and natural weighting ; this results in a synthesized beam of 1.8@xmath34@xmath351.7@xmath34 ( @xmath3213kpc at @xmath22 ) at a major axis position angle of 78@xmath31 .",
    "the final rms in both the line channel and the combined continuum channel is 60@xmath36jy beam@xmath26 .",
    "in the top panel of fig .  1 , the final map of the on channel ( line+continuum emission ) is shown , while the middle panel shows the map of the two combined continuum ( off ) channels , representing the continuum  only flux .",
    "the source is clearly detected in both maps . to derive the total flux density of the source",
    ", a 2dimensional gaussian was fitted to the detected source structure .",
    "our best fit for mg0751 + 2716 gives a gaussian diameter of 2.3@xmath34@xmath352.3@xmath34 ( source convolved with the synthesized beam ) ; i.e.  the emission appears only marginally resolved in our observations , as our beam is too large to recover the lens image substructure seen at higher resolution ( carilli  @xcite ) .",
    "the integrated flux density in the on channel is 10.3 @xmath37 0.2mjy ( peak : 6.12 @xmath37 0.06mjy beam@xmath26 ) , and the continuum flux in the combined off channels is 10.3 @xmath37 0.2mjy ( peak : 5.88 @xmath37 0.06mjy beam@xmath26 ) . from the vla 42.2ghz measurement of 13.2mjy ( carilli  @xcite ) and using a spectral index of @xmath38 ( lehr  @xcite ) , an extrapolated flux density of 12.7mjy can be calculated , which is higher than derived from our observations .",
    "therefore , continuum variability can not be excluded .    in the bottom panel of fig .  1 ,",
    "the continuum - subtracted line map is shown .",
    "this map was generated by subtracting a clean component model of the continuum emission ( combined off channel ) from the visibility data of the on channel , which was then imaged applying the clean algorithm with the same parameters used to create the continuum model .",
    "no clear evidence for  line emission is found .",
    "thus , we set a 3@xmath39 upper limit of @xmath40jy on the peak flux of  emission . for mg0751 + 2716 , we thus derive an upper limit for the  line luminosity of @xmath41kpc@xmath4 ( 3@xmath39 limit , corrected for gravitational magnification , @xmath42 , barvainis  @xcite , cf .",
    "table [ tab-1 ] ) .",
    "given that the 183ghz water maser line most likely arises from extended regions associated with star formation ( cernicharo @xcite ) , we can use our upper limit together with the line luminosity ( barvainis  @xcite ) to estimate how much of the molecular gas in mg0751 + 2716 may be associated with massive star forming regions .",
    "radiative transfer models based on the  emission line show that it is inverted in warm and dense environments ( @xmath43k , @xmath44@xmath14 ) which are typically found in star  forming regions , and that the resulting line brightness temperature critically depends on the underlying physical conditions .",
    "it is known to range from thermalized emission up to line temperatures of @xmath3210000k ( cernicharo  @xcite ; combes  @xcite ) . as an example , observations of the 183ghz water maser towards orion irc2 show that emission arises from narrow ( few ) line features with up to @xmath45k as well as a broad ( @xmath46 ) emission plateau with @xmath47k peak line brightness temperature ( cernicharo  @xcite , @xcite ) . as an order of magnitude estimate , we assume in the following that the  line in mg0751 + 2716 arises from a similar environment as orion with an intrinsic brightness temperature of @xmath48k .",
    "only the  line is observed so far in mg0751 + 2716 , therefore the brightness temperature of the co emission is not well  constrained .",
    "however , the dust continuum temperature of @xmath49k in mg0751 + 2716 ( barvainis & ivison @xcite ) is consistent with those observed in most other high@xmath1 qsos ( e.g.  beelen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition , the co brightness temperature in well",
    " studied high@xmath1 objects such as irasf10214 + 4724 agrees within a factor of @xmath50 with the dust temperature ( e.g. downes  @xcite ) . by analogy , we here assume @xmath51k",
    ".      the combined ratios of the brightness temperatures and line luminosities of h@xmath6o and co ( @xmath52k , @xmath51k , @xmath41kpc@xmath4 , @xmath53kpc@xmath4 ) can be used to estimate the relative area filling factor ( ff ) of both molecules . by this",
    "means , our observed upper limit on the 183ghz h@xmath6o line luminosity together with the  line luminosity translates into an upper limit on the h@xmath6o / co area filling factor of @xmath54 .    to better understand the relevance of this filling factor limit derived from our observations , we now give an independent estimate for the filling factor based on the fir luminosity and geometrical arguments . for this purpose , we assume in the following that all 183ghz h@xmath6o emission in mg0751 + 2716 is created in hot , star  forming cores like the one found in the central region of orion . assuming @xmath55  for the central 1@xmath56 of the orion nebula ( werner  @xcite , corresponding to an area of 0.013pc@xmath4 at a distance of 450pc ) , we find that 10@xmath57 of these cores are needed to account for the far  ir luminosity in mg0751 + 2716 ( table 1 ) . assuming a size of 0.013pc@xmath4 each",
    ", 10@xmath57 of such cores would fill a disk with an equivalent radius of 200pc .",
    "taking the observed  line fwhm and luminosity into account , and assuming @xmath58k , for mg0751 + 2716 , we can calculate that the _ dust and co _ are distributed over a region with an equivalent radius of 450pc . comparing the derived disk sizes",
    ", we thus find an expected h@xmath6o / co area filling factor of @xmath3220% .",
    "this estimate is much higher than what is actually observed .",
    "our results for mg0751 + 2716 are in line with observations of the radio  quiet qsos mkn1014 ( pg0157 + 001 , @xmath59 ) and viizw244 ( pg0838 + 770 , @xmath60 , see table 1 ) , the only two other infrared  luminous galaxies for which upper limits on the 183ghz h@xmath6o line have been reported ( combes  @xcite ) to date .",
    "using the same assumptions on the intrinsic line brightness temperatures as for mg0751 + 2716 , the non  detections in these galaxies imply filling factors of the water line relative to  of @xmath61 and @xmath62 for mkn1014 and viizw244 respectively .",
    "as co emission appears to be close to thermalized up to the  transition in high@xmath1 qsos ( weiss et al .",
    "@xcite ) , these limits are directly comparable to mg0751 + 2716 .    in arp220 ( @xmath63 ) , the  line was detected with a line luminosity of @xmath64kpc@xmath4 ( cernicharo , pardo & weiss 2006 , in prep . ) . with the co luminosity given in solomon  ( @xcite )",
    ", this translates to a h@xmath6o / co filling factor of 0.4% .",
    "arp220 has a far  ir luminosity similar to that of mg0751 + 2716 , which might suggest a similar h@xmath6o / co filling factor .",
    "this suggests that the  line might be detectable in mg0751 + 2716 if the sensitivity was increased only by a factor of few .",
    "for the recent first extragalactic  detection in the liner ngc3079 ( humphreys  @xcite ) , the h@xmath6o / co luminosity ratio ( using same brightness temperatures as before ) translates into a h@xmath6o / co area filling factor of only @xmath65 .",
    "however , it is difficult to assess the relevance of the ngc3079 results for mg0751 + 2716 , as the former is not a ulirg . for lower  luminosity galaxies",
    ", it has been found that the hcn / co luminosity ratio is significantly lower ( 2.54% rather than 1025% , gao & solomon @xcite ) ; by analogy , also lower h@xmath6o / co luminosity ratios may be expected in galaxies with fir luminosities that are significantly lower than in a ulirg .",
    "our observations suggest that the h@xmath6o / co area filling factor in mg0751 + 2716 is significantly lower than expected from simple estimates based on the distribution and temperature of the dust and co.    however , other reasons for the weakness of the water emission should also be considered : as discussed in combes  ( @xcite ) , the physical conditions to efficiently pump the 183ghz line to the assumed 500k may not be present .",
    "there are strong differences in the conditions for h@xmath6o line emission among galactic star  forming regions .",
    "e.g. , the  maser emission in sgrb2(n / m ) is much weaker than that in orionirc2 .",
    "the extent of the maser emitting regions in both sources is of order 1pc , but the observed brightness temperature in sgrb2 is by 12 orders of magnitude lower , reaching only few tens of kelvin ( cernicharo  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is much lower than the 500k we assumed for a typical h@xmath6o emitting region .",
    "the 183ghz h@xmath6o lines are thus only by a factor of 3 amplified relative to co in this source . for high densities and/or column densities , which are known to be present in the compact molecular distributions of luminous ir galaxies , the maser emission of the 183ghz line may even be quenched .",
    "this would lead to thermalized emission without maser amplification ( cernicharo @xcite ; combes  @xcite ) . for thermalized emission in an optically thick environment ,",
    "the  line is not expected to be stronger than those of other high density gas tracers such as hcn . in arp220 , the hcn luminosity is @xmath66kpc@xmath4 , i.e.  by a factor of 3 brighter than  ( cernicharo , pardo & weiss 2006 , in prep . ;",
    "graci - carpio  @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath6o and hcn luminosities in arp220 would thus even be consistent with @xmath67 and an area filling factor that is smaller for h@xmath6o than for hcn .",
    "this suggests that only a small fraction of the dense gas is giving rise to h@xmath6o emission .",
    "carilli  ( @xcite ) set a 3@xmath39 limit of @xmath68kpc@xmath4 on the  line luminosity in mg0751 + 2716 , which is twice as high as our limit for @xmath69 .",
    "it also remains a possibility that the reason for our non  detection is due to limitations in our observing mode . due to the small fraction of gas giving rise to the  emission compared to co , its linewidth could be much smaller than that of the  transition .",
    "this has recently been found in ngc3079 ( humphreys @xcite ) , where the difference in linewidth is more than a factor of 10 .",
    "as our observations had to be done using 50mhz ( 344 ) channels , the emission from a narrow line would be diluted over the full velocity range covered by that channel , rendering detection unlikely even at the achieved sensitivity .",
    "however , in arp220 , which is likely more similar to mg0751 + 2716 , the line has a width of 350 .",
    "such a linewidth would match our observing mode very well .",
    "finally , differential lensing may have an impact on the measured luminosity ratios ( @xmath42 ) , in particular if the co and h@xmath6o emission do not emerge from the same regions .",
    "given the aforementioned results , we find that water maser activity does not outshine emission from rotational transitions of co or hcn in the @xmath70 qso mg0751 + 2716 . if our results can be generalized , we conclude that h@xmath6o ( despite the fact that it potentially traces hot , star  forming cores ) does not appear to be a more luminous alternative to hcn to detect high  density gas in star  forming environments at high redshift .",

    "<S> we conclude that , if our results were to hold for other high@xmath1 sources , h@xmath6o does not appear to be a more luminous alternative to hcn to detect high  density gas in star  forming environments at high redshift . </S>"
