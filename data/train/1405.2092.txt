    "the conventional design of cellular systems prescribes the separation of uplink and downlink transmission via time - division or frequency - division duplex .",
    "one of the main reasons for this choice is that operating a base station in both the uplink and the downlink at the same time causes the downlink transmitted signal to interfere with the uplink received signal .",
    "this self - interference , if not cancelled , overwhelms the uplink signal and makes the full - duplex operation of the base station impractical .",
    "recent advances in analog and digital domain self - interference cancellation challenge the need for this arrangement and open up the possibility to operate base stations , especially low - power ones , in a full - duplex mode ( see the review in @xcite ) .",
    "full - duplex base stations with effective self - interference cancellation seemingly enable the throughput of a cellular system to be doubled , since the available bandwidth can be shared by the uplink and the downlink .",
    "however , this conclusion neglects two additional sources of interference between uplink and downlink transmissions , namely : ( _ i _ ) the _ downlink - to - uplink ( d - u ) inter - cell interference _ that is caused on the uplink signals by the downlink transmissions of neighboring base stations ; and ( _ ii _ ) the _ uplink - to - downlink ( u - d ) interference _ that is caused on the downlink signals by the transmission of mobile stations ( mss ) , both within the same cell and in other cells @xcite .",
    "the impact of intra - cell u - d interference has been studied in @xcite and @xcite for a single - cell system with a single - antenna or a multi - antenna base station , respectively .",
    "multi - cell systems , in which d - u interference and also inter - cell u - d interference arise , have been studied in @xcite via system simulation and in @xcite using stochastic geometry .",
    "the prior work mentioned above focuses on single - cell processing techniques , in which baseband processing is carried out locally at the base stations .",
    "single - cell processing is inherently limited by the d - u interference . with the aim of overcoming this limitation , here",
    "we investigate the impact of the cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) architecture on a full - duplex cellular system . in a c - ran system , the base stations operate solely as radio units ( rus ) , while the baseband processing is carried out at a central unit ( cu ) within the operator s network @xcite .",
    "this migration of baseband processing is enabled by a network of fronthaul links , such as fiber optics cables or mmwave radio links , that connect each ru to the cu .",
    "the centralization of both uplink and downlink baseband processing at the cu allows the cu to perform cancellation of the d - u interference since the downlink signal is known at the cu . in order to further cope also with the u - d interference",
    ", we evaluate the advantages of performing successive interference cancellation at the mss .",
    "accordingly , the strongest intra - cell uplink transmissions are decoded and cancelled before decoding the downlink signals .",
    "the analysis in this letter takes an information theoretic approach that builds on the prior work reviewed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , in order to capture the key elements of the problem at hand , with particular emphasis on the various sources of interference , we focus on a modification of the classical wyner model .",
    "the adoption of this model enables us to derive analytical expressions for the achievable rates under single - cell processing and c - ran operation assuming either half - duplex or full - duplex base stations .",
    "these analytical results provide obtain fundamental insights into the regimes in which full - duplex rus , particularly when implemented with a c - ran architecture , are expected to be advantageous .",
    "consider the extended wyner model depicted in fig . [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the model contains one ms per cell that transmits in the uplink and one that receives in the downlink . with conventional half - duplex rus ,",
    "the two mss transmit in different time - frequency resources , while , with full - duplex rus , uplink and downlink are active at the same time .",
    "we describe here the system model for the full - duplex system  the modifications needed to describe the half - duplex system will be apparent .    there are @xmath0 cells and inter - cell interference takes place only between adjacent cells as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in order to avoid border effects ,",
    "as it is customary , we take @xmath0 to be very large . due to the limited span of the interference ,",
    "results in the regime of @xmath1 are known to be accurate also for small values of @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) . in the uplink ,",
    "the ms active in the @xmath2th cell transmits a signal @xmath3 with power @xmath4\\leq p_{u}$ ] , with @xmath5 being the power constraint .",
    "similarly , in the downlink , each @xmath2th ru transmits a signal @xmath6 with power @xmath7\\leq p_{d}$ ] .",
    "the baseband signal received in uplink by the @xmath2th ru is given as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 denotes the convolution ; @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the kronecker delta function , accounts for the direct channel , which has unit power gain , and for the inter - cell interference , which is characterized by the inter - cell interference power gain @xmath12 ; @xmath13 models the _ d - u interference _ with inter - cell power gain @xmath14 and self - interference power gain @xmath15 ; and @xmath16 is white gaussian noise with unit power .    in the downlink , the signal received by the ms in the @xmath2th cell can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 describes the _ u - d interference _ , which has inter - cell power gain @xmath19 and intra - cell power gain @xmath20 ; and @xmath21 is white gaussian noise with unit power . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the parameter @xmath20 accounts for the power received by the ms active in the downlink from the ms active in the uplink within the same cell .",
    "each ru is connected to the cu with a fronthaul link of capacity @xmath22 in the uplink and @xmath23 in the downlink .",
    "these capacities are measured in bits / s / hz , where the normalization is with respect to the bandwidth shared by the uplink and downlink channels .    we assume full channel state information at the cu for both uplink and downlink .",
    "define as @xmath24 and @xmath25 the per - cell rates , measured in bits / s / hz , achievable in uplink and downlink , respectively , by a particular scheme .",
    "the _ equal per - cell rate _ is now defined as @xmath26    _ notation _ :",
    "for convenience of notation , we define the shannon capacity @xmath27 and the function @xmath28 .",
    "in this section , we review the performance in the presence of the conventional half - duplex constraint on the rus . in this case , a fraction @xmath29 $ ] of the time - frequency resources are devoted to the uplink and the remaining fraction @xmath30 to the downlink .      with single - cell processing ,",
    "each ru encodes in downlink and decodes in uplink with no cooperation from the other rus .",
    "the fronthaul links are used to convey the downlink information streams from the cu to the rus and to transport the decoded uplink data streams from the rus to the cu .    in the uplink ,",
    "the inter - cell interference , which has power @xmath31 , is treated as noise . as a result",
    ", the achievable rate per cell is given as @xmath32 in ( [ eq : uplink hd scp ] ) , the second term accounts for the limitations imposed by the fronthaul links for the transmission of the decoded data streams to the cu .",
    "similarly , by treating inter - cell interference as noise in the downlink , we obtain the per - cell achievable rate @xmath33 .",
    "we note that full power is used in both uplink and downlink with no loss of optimality .",
    "finally , the equal per - cell rate is obtained by optimizing over the fraction @xmath34 as @xmath35}{\\textrm{max}}\\min\\left\\ { fr_{u},(1-f)r_{d}\\right\\ } $ ] , which yields @xmath36      with c - ran operation , baseband processing is carried out at the cu , while the rus act solely as downconverters in the uplink and upconverters in the downlink .",

    "the limit at hand can be calculated as ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "note that in ( [ eq : uplink hd cran ] ) the quantization noise affects the noise level at the decoder .      for the downlink ,",
    "the cu performs channel coding and precoding and then compresses the resulting baseband signals prior to transmission on the fronthaul links to the rus .",
    "the rus then simply upconverts the baseband signal and transmits it to the mss .",
    "we assume that channel encoding is performed separately on each data stream producing the independent signal @xmath48 for each @xmath2th cell .",
    "the selection of the power @xmath49 will be discussed below .",
    "linear precoding is then applied at the cu , so that the precoded signal reads @xmath50 for a given precoding vector @xmath51 . without loss of generality",
    ", we impose the constraint @xmath52 .",
    "one can also assume that , by the symmetry of the problem , the filter @xmath53 is real and symmetric around @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "the precoded signal is quantized producing the quantized baseband signal @xmath56 with quantization noise @xmath57 , which is white and independent of all other variables .",
    "the quantization noise is related to the fronthaul capacity @xmath23 by imposing the equality @xmath58 , which yields @xmath59    the achievable per - cell rate is @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "note that in ( [ eq : downlink hd cran ] ) the sources of noise are the interference from the undesired downlink signal streams ( @xmath62 ) and the quantization noise ( @xmath63 ) .",

    "4.2.3 ) ) . in summary , for any given precoding filter @xmath53 ,",
    "the per - cell equal rate is equal to ( [ eq : req ] ) with @xmath25 in ( [ eq : uplink hd cran ] ) and @xmath24 in ( [ eq : downlink hd cran ] ) .",
    "in this section , we consider the performance with full - duplex ru operation . as in @xcite-@xcite , we assume that the cancellation of known d - u interference signals is ideal in order to focus on the potential advantages of full - duplex .      with single - cell processing ,",
    "each ru is able to cancel its self - interference d - u signal . as a result , the achievable uplink per - cell rate is obtained , similar to ( [ eq : uplink hd scp ] ) , as @xmath69 where the additional term @xmath70 at the denominator accounts for the d - u interference .",
    "note that we have allowed for a transmit power @xmath4\\leq p_{u},$ ] since with full - duplex , unlike the case of half - duplex operation , it can be advantageous not to use the full available power . in an analogous fashion ,",
    "the achievable rate for the downlink is @xmath71 where the additional term @xmath72 is the power of the u - d interference .",
    "the intra - cell interference , with power @xmath73 , is caused by a ms in the same cell and therefore it is expected to be very relevant . in order to mitigate this problem , here we explore the possibility that the mss implement a successive interference cancellation receiver in which the intra - cell uplink signal is first decoded and then cancelled before decoding the intended signal .",
    "now , using standard results on the capacity region of multiple access channels ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.6 ) ) , the rate achievable with single - cell processing is given as @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 equal to @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "finally , the equal per - cell rate can be calculated as @xmath81    @xmath82        as discussed above , in the uplink of a c - ran , the signals received by the rus , after d - u self - interference cancellation , are compressed and forwarded to the cu , which then performs joint decoding .",
    "each @xmath37th ru produces a compressed version ( [ eq : quantized uplink signal ] ) of the received signal .",
    "similar to ( [ eq : quant uplink ] ) , the quantization noise power @xmath83 is calculated as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the correlation function of the downlink filter .",

    "based the received signals ( [ eq : quantized uplink signal ] ) , the cu first cancels the d - u interference .",
    "note that this is possible since the downlink signals are known to the cu .",

    "similar to ( [ eq : uplink hd cran ] ) , the corresponding achievable rate per cell can be written as @xmath87      we adopt linear precoding as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : downlink hd ] .",
    "accordingly , if u - d intra - cell interference is treated as noise , the achievable per - cell rate is given as ( [ eq : downlink fd cran ] ) .",

    "in this section , we provide some numerical results to bring insights into the performance of the discussed approaches . fig .",

    "the inter - cell d - u interference gain @xmath97 is chosen to be comparable to the inter - cell gain @xmath98 , while the u - d intra - cell interference gain @xmath99 is significantly larger and the corresponding inter - cell gain @xmath100 is instead significantly smaller than @xmath98 .",
    "this setting appears to be in line with what is expected in a dense small - cell scenario in which the rus are placed in a more advantageous position than the mss .",
    "a zf precoder is assumed for the downlink , and , unless stated otherwise , successive interference cancellation ( sic ) is employed in the downlink .",
    "the figure shows that c - ran solutions have a significant advantage over the corresponding single - cell processing ( scp ) approaches for both half - duplex ( hd ) and full - duplex ( fd ) operations as long as the fronthaul capacities are large enough .",
    "note that the spectral efficiency of the fronthaul links is expected to at least one order of magnitude larger than the downlink or uplink spectral efficiencies , which is well within the range shown in the figure .",
    "moreover , when the fronthaul capacities are sufficiently large , fd - c - ran provides a gain of around 1.7 as compared to hd - c - ran , which falls short of the maximum gain of 2 due to the interference between uplink and downlink .",
    "we finally study the impact of u - d intra - cell interference in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 - 3 ] .",
    "the parameters are the same as for the previous figure . for the full - duplex approaches",
    ", we consider the rate @xmath102 achievable with and without sic as a function of @xmath99 .",
    "it is seen that , fd - c - ran is advantageous only if we have small intra - cell interference @xmath99 or if the mss implement sic and the gain @xmath99 is large enough .",
    "this suggests that , in practice , fd - c - ran should only be used in conjunction with an appropriate scheduling algorithm that ensures one of these two conditions to be satisfied .",
