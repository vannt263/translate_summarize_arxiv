    "the currents in each edge of an electrical circuit , which is composed of linear elements ( i.e. , resistance , capacitance , and inductance ) and where conservation of charge at each node is granted , are generally found by solving kirchhoff s equations @xcite . in particular , for resistor networks , the solution for the currents at each edge is related to random walks in graphs @xcite , first - passage times @xcite , finding shortest - paths and community structures on weighted networks @xcite , and network topology spectral characteristics @xcite . though the relationship between currents and voltage differences in network circuits with linear elements follows ohm s law , their modelling capability is enormous .",
    "for example , it is used to model fractures in materials @xcite , biologically inspired transport networks @xcite , airplane traffic networks @xcite , robot path planing @xcite , queueing systems @xcite , etc . in practice ,",

    "later , loops are defined with an assigned current which do not contain any inner loop , then the kirchhoff s voltage equations are solved .",
    "these constitute classic techniques of circuit theory .",
    "however , nodal and mesh methods ( or even transfer function methods @xcite ) become inefficient to recalculate the voltage drops across the network if the location of inputs and outputs changes constantly , e.g. , if the cathode and/or anode of a voltage generator are moved from one node of the network to another .",

    "in this work , we present novel general analytical solutions for current conservative dc / ac circuit networks with resistive , capacitive , and/or inductive edge characteristics .",
    "the novelty comes from expressing the currents and voltage drops in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the admittance ( namely , the inverse of the edge impedance ) laplacian matrix of the circuit network .    in order to derive our novel solutions",
