    "cluster - tilted algebras are finite dimensional associative algebras which were introduced in @xcite and , independently , in @xcite for the type @xmath12 .",
    "one motivation for introducing these algebras came from fomin and zelevinsky s cluster algebras @xcite . to every cluster in an acyclic cluster algebra one can associate a cluster - tilted algebra , and the indecomposable rigid modules over the cluster - tilted algebra correspond bijectively to the cluster variables outside the chosen cluster .",
    "generalizations of cluster - tilted algebras , the jacobian algebras of quivers with potentials , were introduced in @xcite , extending this correspondence to the non - acyclic types .",
    "many people have studied cluster - tilted algebras in this context , see for example @xcite .",
    "the second motivation came from classical tilting theory .",
    "tilted algebras are the endomorphism algebras of tilting modules over hereditary algebras , whereas cluster - tilted algebras are the endomorphism algebras of cluster - tilting objects over cluster categories of hereditary algebras .",
    "this similarity in the two definitions lead to the following precise relation between tilted and cluster - tilted algebras , which was established in @xcite .",

    "this result allows one to define cluster - tilted algebras without using the cluster category .",

    "the hochschild cohomology of the algebras @xmath0 and @xmath7 has been compared in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use a new approach to study the relation between the module categories of a tilted algebra @xmath0 and its cluster - tilted algebra @xmath1 , namely _ induction _ and _",
    "coinduction_.    the induction functor @xmath2 and the coinduction functor @xmath17 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 are defined whenever @xmath0 is a subring of @xmath7 which has the same identity .",
    "if we are dealing with algebras over a field @xmath20 , we can , and usually do , write the coinduction functor as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the standard duality .    induction and coinduction are important tools in classical representation theory of finite groups . in this case , @xmath7 would be the group algebra of a finite group @xmath23 and @xmath0 the group algebra of a subgroup of @xmath23 ( over a field whose characteristic is not dividing the group orders ) .",
    "in this situation , the algebras are semi - simple , induction and coinduction are the same functor , and this functor is exact .    for arbitrary rings , and even for finite dimensional algebras , the situation is not that simple .",
