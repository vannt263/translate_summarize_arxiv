    "a particle in a periodic potential lacking spatial reflection symmetry , known as a ratchet potential @xcite , exhibits a net unidirectional motion in the absence of a net driving force .",
    "this static response to an oscillating force is known as the ratchet effect .",
    "the net unidirectional motion exhibited in ratchet potentials is the key feature potentially interesting for applications . in josephson junction systems , various realizations of ratchet effect",
    "have been investigated @xcite .",
    "recently we proposed @xcite a single flux quantum in a long annular josephson junction embedded in an inhomogeneous magnetic field as an experimentally accessible solid state example of a relativistic particle in a ratchet potential . here",
    "we briefly review the experimental demonstration of the ratchet effect in such a solid state system in the overdamped regime @xcite and we report new data in the underdamped regime .",
    "an inhomogeneous magnetic field generates a potential for a flux quantum trapped in a long annular josephson junction [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .    with a suitable choice @xcite for the width @xmath0 of a control line on the top of the junction",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] a sawtooth - like magnetic field can be generated .    using the perturbative approach , the equation of motion for the center of mass @xmath1 of a flux quantum trapped in the junction can be found .",
    "the result @xcite is the equation of a relativistic particle subjected to an inhomogeneous force @xmath2 with a sawtooth - like ratchet potential @xmath3 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] and an homogeneous forcing @xmath4 : @xmath5 here the strength of the ratchet potential @xmath3 is controlled by the control current @xmath6 and the homogeneous forcing @xmath4 by the current @xmath7 feeding the junction .",
    "the measured static voltage @xmath8 is proportional to the spatial mean @xmath9 of the fluxon velocity . in physical units , @xmath10 with limiting velocity @xmath11",
    "the samples were fabricated with the geometry shown in fig .  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "the nb / al@xmath12o@xmath13/nb annular junctions had a circumference @xmath14 1200 @xmath15 m and width @xmath1620 @xmath15 m .",
    "the control lines were electrically insulated from the junctions by a 300  nm thick sio@xmath12 layer . here",
    "we report junctions with normalized lengths @xmath17 , and @xmath18      figure  [ fig2](a ) shows the measured current - voltage ( force - velocity ) curve    of the fluxon trapped in the junction with @xmath19 when a current is fed in the control line . as expected for an asymmetric potential , two different depinning current @xmath20 and @xmath21 are recovered .",
    "the curve is recorded at t=6.5  k. at this temperature , the dissipation parameter @xmath22 is large enough to overcome inertial effects and the overdamped regime with a nonhysteretic current - voltage curve is achieved . in this regime",
    "the dynamics is described by the noninertial version @xcite of eq .",
    "( [ inert ] ) .",
    "the ratchet effect generates a net transport velocity , @xmath23 in response to an ac forcing . in our system",
    "such a velocity is proportional to the measured voltage @xmath24 averaged over the period of an alternating current fed in to the junction . for ac",
    "forcing we use an `` adiabatic '' square wave , i.e. , with a period much larger than the typical response time of the system , of the order of 150  ps . the measured ratchet voltage as a function of the amplitude of the ac forcing",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . a comparison of experimental data @xcite with theory @xcite is also shown .",
    "the three typical regions expected from the ratchet effect are clearly exhibited : the static region i where the fluxon is at rest ( pinned ) , the active region ii where the fluxon motion is strictly unidirectional , and the overdriven region iii where fluxon motion is unidirectional in the mean @xcite . from the time domain snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , we also notice a strong rectification of the input current ( diode effect ) in the active region and a weak rectification effect in the overdriven region .      as noted above , results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] were recorded in the overdamped regime we achieved at t=6.5  k. as the thermal bath temperature is lowered , the dissipation parameter @xmath22 is reduced more and more , so that an underdamped regime with dynamics described by eq .",
    "( [ inert ] ) can be achieved . the numerically calculated current - voltage curve for this regime , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) is now fully hysteretic .",
    "the ratchet voltage calculated for an adiabatic triangular ac current forcing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "experimentally , such an inertial regime is achieved at t=4.2  k for our fluxon . both the measured current - voltage [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] and the measured ratchet voltage [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] fully agree with numerical predictions shown in fig .",
    "the time domain snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) suggest that the strongest rectification of the input current ( diode effect ) is again achieved in the active region .",
    "moreover , with respect to the noninertial regime , a substantial rectification is also obtained in the overdriven region .    as stated above",
    ", our fluxon has a typical response time of the order of 150  ps , so that a response to microwave signals can be addressed .",
    "theory @xcite predicts that when a.c .",
    "current forcing with frequency @xmath25 in the microwave range is used , the d.c .",
    "characteristic ( @xmath26 ) should exhibits current steps at voltages @xmath27 , with @xmath28 integer and @xmath29 the flux - quantum .",
    "numerically , the voltage spacing of these microwave induced steps is @xmath30=2.07 \\nu _ { rf}[{\\rm ghz } ] .",
    "\\label{deltav}\\ ] ] dynamically , these curent steps accounts for a locking of the revolution motion of the fluxon with the external drive @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ratchet effect , i.e. , the existence of a mean voltage as a response to an a.c .",
    "forcing , compels a zero - current - axis crossing @xcite in the @xmath26 curve . in other words",
    ", one should observe @xmath31 0 at @xmath32 when the junction is irradiated with microwaves .",
    "the mean voltage @xmath33 induced by the a.c .",
    "current forcing normally exibits only one polarity for a fixed sign of the static spatial ratchet potential .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , and fig  [ fig4](b ) a positive polarity was recovered for the used potential .",
    "this means that the mean velocity of the fluxon was always positive ( or zero , in the static region ) .",
    "however , recently has been predicted @xcite that the ratchet velocity can change sign in the inertial regime .",
    "this fenomenon is known as    `` current reversal '' effect .",
    "the word `` current '' is mutuated from brownian motion field and means net velocity . in our system",
    "this correspond to our ratchet voltage @xmath34 .",
    "current reversal ( inversion of @xmath34 in our system ) can appear for frequencies of the a.c . forcing comparable with the typical frequencies of evolution of the inertial ratchet system , or , in other words , for frequencies where locking occurs .",
    "in our system this means the microwave range .",
    "dynamically , the current reversal corresponds to the onset of a chaotic dynamical regime @xcite .",
    "experiments with microwave forcing currents were performed on the junction with @xmath35 . the control current was chosen to have a ( normally ) positive ratchet voltage .",
    "the modification of the @xmath26 curve for increasing power of a signal at @xmath25=0.5  ghz is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) . as expected @xcite , a zero current axis crossing",
    "is observed ( @xmath36 at p=  6dbm ) with manifestation of small current steps spaced about 1  @xmath15v , as expected from relation ( [ deltav ] ) .",
    "the current steps are better evident in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , where a @xmath25=2.6  ghz was used .",
    "consistently with ( [ deltav ] ) here @xmath37 is observed .",
    "moreover , also somewhat that recall a chaotic behavior is envisaged in the current - voltage curves ( at p=-20  dbm and p=-18  dbm ) , but no current reversal is observed at the chosen frequency ( is always @xmath38 ) . such a current reversal ( @xmath39 )",
    "is instead observed with @xmath25=2.0  ghz and @xmath25=5.8  ghz , as shown in fig .",
    "the current steps corresponding to a motion syncronized in the direction opposite to the `` natural '' direction , i.e. , the steps with negative voltage polarity in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , are quite noisy and instable , accounting for some quite chaotic internal dynamics .",
    "the onset of a chaotic dynamics is also envisaged when current reversal occurs , as better seen in the panels at p=-18 dbm in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , and at p=2  dbm in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with theory @xcite of inertial ratchets .",
    "we have considered a single flux quantum in a long annular josephson junction embedded in an inhomogeneous magnetic field as an experimentally accessible solid state example of a relativistic particle in a ratchet potential .",
    "in such a solid state system mechanical quantities are proportional to electrical quantities , so that the ratchet effect represents the realization of a relativistic - flux - quantum - based diode .",
    "mean static voltage response , equivalent to directed fluxon motion , has been experimentally demonstrated in such a diode for deterministic and adiabatic current forcing both in the overdamped ( noninertial ) and in the underdamped ( inertial ) dynamical regime .",
    "in the underdamped regime , also nonadiabatic current forcing , corresponding to the microwave range forcing , has been experimentally addressed , and the predicted synchronization with external drive as well as the current reversal phenomenon have been recovered in the system .",
