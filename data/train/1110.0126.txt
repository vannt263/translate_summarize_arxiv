    "massive stars are sources of copious stellar wind , which creates circumstellar shells of a wide range of morphologies @xcite .",
    "detection of such nebulae by means of infrared observations accompanied by spectroscopic follow - ups of their central stars provide a useful tool for revealing evolved massive stars @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of a new wr star in the lmc using this tool .",
    "the new circular shell ( figure[fig1 ] ) was discovered using the 24@xmath0 m sage - lmc data @xcite during our search for bow shocks around runaway ob stars in the lmc ( for motivation and the results of this search see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to determine the spectral type of the central star associated with the shell we obtained its spectrum with the gemini multi - object spectrograph south ( gmos - s )",
    "the acquisition image resolved the central star in two components , hereafter star1 and star2 ( see middle panel of figure[fig1 ] ) .",
    "figure[fig2 ] shows the normalized spectrum of star1 obtained with the gmos - s in a long - slit mode .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by strong emissions of heii @xmath1 4686 , nv @xmath2 4603 , 4620 , 4944 and h@xmath3 .",
    "the h@xmath3 and the heii @xmath1 4686 lines show central absorption reversals .",
    "the spectrum also shows several lower - intensity broad emission features with narrow absorption reversals , of which the most prominent are h@xmath4 and heii @xmath5 .",
    "other h and he lines are almost purely in absorption .",
    "the presence of the nv @xmath2 4603 , 4620 emission lines and the absence of the niii @xmath2 4634 - 41 multiplet implies that the emission spectrum belongs to the ionization subclass wn3 @xcite .",
    "the fwhm of the heii @xmath1 4686 ( emission ) line of 31.1  is quite large and star1 can be classified wn3b , but this value is still very close to the empirically determined limit of 30  for broad - lined stars @xcite . if star1 is really a broad - line star ( which are believed to be the true h - free wn stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the numerous absorption lines in its spectrum might be caused by an unresolved companion massive star .",
    "an indirect support to the binary status of star1 comes from its position on the plot of ew(5411 ) versus fwhm(4686 ) for wn stars in the lmc ( see figure14 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where it lies in a region occupied by composite stars .",
    "detailed comparison of the two spectra of star1 collected on 2011 february 9 and 2011 march 5 , however , does not show any evidence of significant change in the radial velocity .",
    "however , if the period is long and/or a multiple of our poor time sampling and/or if the eccentricity is high , many more spectra are needed in order to really state if the star is a binary or not .",
    "alternatively , the absorption lines mimicking an o - type spectrum could be intrinsic to star1 itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spectrum of star2 is dominated by h and hei absorption lines ( gvaramadze et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "no heii lines are visible in the spectrum . using",
    "the h@xmath6-absolute magnitude calibration by @xcite and the measured ew(h@xmath6)=3.80  , we estimated the spectral type of star2 as b0v .    the lopsided brightness distribution over the shell and the offset of the wr star from the geometric centre of the shell ( see figure[fig1 ] ) suggest that the star is a runaway ( moving from west to east ) and that the stellar wind interacts with dense ambient medium ( shed during the preceding evolutionary phase ) comoving with the star @xcite .",
    "proceeding from this , we searched for known star clusters to the west of the wr star and found that this star was probably ejected from the open cluster ngc 1722 ( located at @xmath7 pc in projection from the star ; see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "<S> we report the first - ever discovery of an extragalactic wolf - rayet ( wr ) star with _ spitzer_. a new wr star in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) was revealed via detection of its circumstellar shell using 24 @xmath0 m images obtained in the framework of the _ spitzer _ survey of the large magellanic cloud ( sage - lmc ) . </S>",
