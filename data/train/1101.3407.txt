    "for a long time the mixing of @xmath13 is of a great theoretical interest because it concerns many aspects of the underlying dynamic and the structure of pseudoscalar meson .",
    "one can investigate this mixing from two distinct schemes , namely they may be a mixture of the octet and singlet of the flavor su(3 ) , or @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 that are the mass eigenstates if we can assume an u - d degeneracy .",
    "the two schemes reflect different understandings of the essential physics .",
    "moreover , the general principle of qcd implies that a gluonic degree of freedom of @xmath16 may be involved in the physical states @xmath0 and @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the qcd anomaly indeed may induce such a mixing",
    ". it would be crucially interesting to make a definite judgement if there is a sizable gluonic component in @xmath0 and @xmath1 from either an underlying theory or phenomenology .",
    "obviously even though the qcd anomaly is well formulated , it is hard to find its contribution to physical eigenstates because the matrix elements of the anomaly operator are dominated by the non - perturbative qcd and not reliably calculable so far .",
    "therefore , one should turn to the phenomenological studies from which one may gain much information about the non - perturbative qcd , i.e. the mysterious aspect of the successful theory . in this work",
    ", we are going to determine the fraction of the glueball component in @xmath0 and @xmath1 along the line .",
    "some researches@xcite were done on this topic .",
    "generally the authors obtained the mixing from different decay or production processes @xcite .",
    "it can be conjectured that different modes are governed by different physics mechanisms besides the mixing which is the goal of our investigation , the uncertainties are not controllable , therefore the errors would be large .",
    "instead , we suggest to use the data of semileptonic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 where the reaction mechanism should be the unique . thus one can expect that in such a way , uncertainty could be greatly reduced . in the theoretical calculations ,",
    "we employ the light - front - quark model ( lfqm ) which has been widely used for calculating the hadronic matrix elements . in the model , there are two independent model parameters ( see the text for details ) which are related to non - perturbative qcd and should be fixed by fitting data .    in our previous work @xcite , with the data of three independent measurements on @xmath17@xcite , @xmath18 and @xmath19@xcite we determined the @xmath13 mixing @xmath20 and predicted the branching ratio @xmath21@xcite which is consistent with the current data @xmath22 measured by cleo collaborator recently@xcite .",
    "it is noted that there are three free parameters if the gluonic degree of freedom in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is not accounted , namely two are the model parameters and another is the mixing angle . instead , if one needs to consider the extra mixing between quark states with gluonic degree of freedom , there are four free parameters and at least four independent measurements are necessary .",
    "even though in the framework the assumption of null component of gluonium state is adopted and the predicted branching ratio of @xmath23 is consistent with data , one still can not confirm that there indeed is no gluonium component in @xmath0 and @xmath1 because the experimental errors are relatively large .",
    "considering the present data , one can conclude that the central value of the fraction of gluonium in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is consistent with zero , but while taking into account the error tolerance , instead , we would only able to obtain an upper bound of its fraction .",
    "fortunately , thanks to the new measurements carried out by the cleo collaboration@xcite , the data for all the four decay modes are available , which enable us to simultaneously fit the two model parameters and the two mixing angles .",
    "thus we may determine the fraction of the gluonium component in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( concretely the upper bound of the gluonium component ) .",
    "after this introduction , we describe the working framework and provide all necessary formulas . in the following section",
    ", we present our numerical results and the last section is devoted to the discussions and conclusion .",
    "in the theoretical framework where gluonium component is not accounted , the mixing matrix of @xmath13 is set as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 and it is noted that both of them are not su(3 ) singlet .",
    "we referred this mixing as scenario - i in this work .    since the qcd anomaly causes the mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , there is no any rule to forbid a mixing between the quark states and a glueball state of the quantum number @xmath16 .",
    "as one extends the picture to involve a gluonium component , a new scenario which we refer as the scenario - ii , was suggested in refs . @xcite as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a pure gluonium state and the physical state @xmath11 was identified as @xmath10@xcite .    as discussed in the introduction , once there are data on @xmath29 available in addition to the other three modes , we will be able to extract @xmath6 directly .",
    "moreover new @xmath30 deviates from the old datum and the combined branching ratios of @xmath31 @xcite demands a redetermination of the mixing angles in ( [ mixing12 ] ) .",
    "our strategy is that the mixing angles @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the model parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 in the wave functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are simultaneously determined by fitting solely one type of data i.e. we theoretically calculate the branching ratios of @xmath29 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 and match them with data . thus we  extract \" the mixing angles directly from the semileptonic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we use the light front quark model ( lfqm ) to evaluate the hadronic transition matrix elements @xcite , then obtain the decay widths of @xmath37 and @xmath38 which are functions of @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the transition diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfqm ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the hadronic matrix elements for @xmath39 transition can be parameterized as @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the pseudoscalar meson , @xmath42 is the momentum of initial ( final ) meson , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "all other notations can be found in the appendix .",
    "since the calculations are done in space - like region one need to analytically continue them to the time - like region .",
    "it is convenient to redefine the matrix elements as @xmath51 the relations among the form factors are @xmath52    the form factors in the space - like region are parameterized in a three - parameter form as @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents the form factor @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 are fixed by performing a three - parameter fit to the form factors in the space - like region .",
    "we then use these parameters to determine the physical form factors in the time - like region .",
    "the input quark masses are directly taken from ref . @xcite as @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 gev , @xmath61 gev .",
    "we first need to determine the model parameters for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "they can be fully determined by fitting their decay constants which are related to their total widths . for a pseudoscalar meson",
    "the decay constant can be evaluated @xmath62    the decay constants are experimentally measured as @xmath63 . with them the model parameters for @xmath64 and @xmath65 are fixed to be @xmath66 gev , @xmath67 gev @xcite .",
    "since the total widths are better measured , the model parameters of the heavy mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 are determined with higher accuracy .",
    "once the model parameters at the initial side are fixed , we would turn to concern the decay products . at first look",
    ", there are six free parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 to be fixed .",
    "it seems that there are not enough equations to determine all these parameters .",
    "however , as discussed in ref.@xcite two relations @xmath72 and @xmath73 hold , thus the number of unknowns reduces to four . matching the theoretically calculated branching ratios with the data for the four decay modes , we obtain all the values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the mixing angles are fitted to be @xmath7 and @xmath8(@xmath76 ) where the errors are from the experimental side .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath77 gev and @xmath78 gev .    with these parameters , assuming @xmath10 to be the physical state @xmath11 whose main content is glueonium @xmath79 , we are able to estimate the branching ratios of @xmath4 decaying into eta(1405 ) via its @xmath80 components and we obtain @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "accurate measurements on these semi - leptonic decay modes may tell us if the main content of @xmath10 is glueonium ( i.e. a glueball candidate ) and further test the scenario ii for the mixing .",
    "in ref.@xcite by fitting the data of several radiative decay modes such as @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 method . ] and @xmath87 was fixed if one sets @xmath88 as a free parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath5 obtained from different kinds of experiments are consistent with each other in a reasonable error tolerance but the central value of @xmath88 diverges over a range .",
    "the central value of @xmath88 obtained from the semileptonic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 inclines to that the fraction of the gluonium state in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is consistent with zero , but since there exists a relatively large uncertainty in the data , it is hard to conclude that it does not exist , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "it is urgent to improve the precision of measurement on these channels especially on @xmath90 .    in this work ,",
    "we employ the lfqm model to evaluate the hadronic transition matrix elements .",
    "we fix the model parameters by fitting data , so that some theoretical uncertainties are involved in those parameters .",
    "definitely the results are still model dependent because we employ a concrete model : the lfqm .",
    "but since all inputs are taken from the same source ( i.e. the data of the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , one can expect that relative errors would be partly compensated , so that the model - dependence of the results is somehow alleviated .",
    "because of absence of the final state interactions , the semileptonic decays have obvious advantages for determining the properties of the produced light hadrons , such as the structure of @xmath91 , @xmath13 mixing and even a mixing of pseudoscalar mesons with glueball .",
    "moreover , as suggested , assuming that the physical state @xmath10 is the mixture @xmath11 whose main content is glueonium , we calculate the branching ratios of @xmath92 and and @xmath93 .",
    "the semileptonic decay modes will be measured by the future experiments .",
    "then the proposed scenario ii for the mixing of @xmath94 , @xmath95 and glueoinum @xmath79 will be tested .",
