    "this tutorial describes recent progress in the theory of markov decision processes ( mdps ) with infinite state and action sets that have significant applications to inventory control .",
    "two groups of results are covered : ( i ) optimality conditions for mdps with total , discounted and average - cost criteria , and ( ii ) optimality conditions for partially observable markov decision processes ( pomdps ) with total and discounted cost criteria .",
    "inventory control studies and applications are important motivating factors for studies of mdps .",
    "the mdp studies provided important tools for the analysis of inventory control problems .",
    "the parallel development of these fields since the beginning of the second half of the 20th century is broadly recognized .",
    "for example , the abstract of the historical essay by girlich and chikan  @xcite on the history of inventory control studies states : `` ... we report how inventory problems have motivated the improvement of mathematical disciplines such as markovian decision theory and optimal control of stochastic systems to provide a new basis of inventory theory in the second half of our century . ''",
    "however , over a long period of time there was a gap between the modeling needs for inventory control , that require mathematical methods for the analysis of infinite - state controlled stochastic systems with unbounded action sets and weakly continuous transition probabilities , and available results for the corresponding models for mdps .",
    "this gap was recently closed .",
    "another topic covered in this tutorial is the recent progress in the development of optimality conditions for pomdps .",
    "the literature on mdps and inventory control is huge , and we do not attempt a comprehensive survey in this tutorial .",
    "for the most part only directly relevant references are provided .",
    "the reader may find coverage of these topics in the books @xcite on mdps and @xcite on inventory management .",
    "optimality results for mdps provide sufficient conditions for the existence of stationary and markov optimal policies satisfying optimality equations and inequalities , describe continuity properties of the value function , and guarantee the convergence of value iteration and optimal actions when the horizon length tends to infinity or the discount factor tends to 1 .",
    "these results provide useful tools to analyze specific inventory control problems and to prove the optimality of particular policies . in section  [ s4 ] this is illustrated with the classic periodic - review single - product stochastic inventory problem with nonnegative arbitrarily distributed iid demand .",
    "most of the literature on inventory control is limited to discrete or continuous demand distributions .",
    "consider the classic periodic - review single - product stochastic inventory problem with backorders .",
    "for a finite horizon and continuous demand , scarf  @xcite established under some conditions the optimality of @xmath0 policies .",
    "zabel  @xcite indicated some gaps in @xcite , corrected them , and mentioned in the last paragraph of @xcite that the proofs there can be adapted to arbitrary demand distributions .",
    "iglehart  @xcite and veinott and wagner  @xcite established the optimality of @xmath0 policies for the infinite horizon for continuous and discrete demand respectively .",
    "zheng  @xcite provided an alternative proof for discrete demand .",
    "beyer and sethi  @xcite described and corrected gaps in the proofs in @xcite . as shown in heyman and sobel  [ section 7.1]@xcite , under appropriate conditions @xmath0 policies are optimal for a finite - horizon problem with arbitrarily distributed demand .",
    "in general , @xmath0 policies may not be optimal for finite horizons .",
    "for example , for a problem with convex holding costs the appropriate condition is assumption  * gb * in section  [ s4 ] .",
    "this assumption means that , as the amount of backordered inventory increases , the backordering cost per unit time becomes larger than the value of the backordered inventory .",
    "however , as shown in veinott  @xcite for discrete demand , @xmath0 policies are always optimal for the following three criteria : ( i ) infinite - horizon average costs per unit time , ( ii ) infinite - horizon discounted problems with a large discount factor , and ( iii ) finite - horizon problems with appropriately selected terminal costs .",
    "chen and simchi - levi  @xcite described optimal policies for coordinating inventory control and pricing for finite and infinite - horizon problems with general demand under a technical assumption . if the price is fixed , the problem in @xcite becomes the periodic - review inventory control problem , the technical assumption becomes assumption  * gb * , and the results in @xcite imply the optimality of @xmath0 policies . for coordinating inventory control and pricing , huh et al .",
    "@xcite provided a method for proving the optimality of stationary policies by adding specific assumptions that hold for inventory control to the mdp assumptions .    using the results from feinberg et al .",
    "@xcite on the existence of stationary optimal policies and their properties for mdps with general state and action sets and with possibly unbounded one - step cost functions , feinberg and lewis  @xcite proved the optimality of @xmath0 policies for a general demand distribution for criteria ( i  iii ) mentioned in the previous paragraph . feinberg and liang",
    "@xcite provided a complete description of optimal discounted policies for arbitrary demand .",
    "these results cover the results under assumption  * gb * as a special case .",
    "feinberg and liang  @xcite proved the validity of the optimality equation for average costs per unit time , while the general results for mdps @xcite imply only the validity the optimality inequality .",
    "the conclusions from @xcite are presented in section  [ s3 ] .",
    "studies of mdps started with investigations of models with finite state and action sets .",
    "problems with infinite state and action sets were investigated later .",
    "the two classic objective criteria for infinite - horizon problems are : ( i ) minimization of expected total discounted costs , and ( ii ) minimization of long - run average costs per unit time .",
    "problems with average cost criteria are usually more difficult .",
    "in particular , optimality equations can be written for expected total costs under mild conditions , and for total expected discounted costs their analyses lead to the proof of optimality of stationary policies for infinite - horizon problems . for long - run average costs ,",
    "stationary policies are optimal under stronger conditions than for discounted costs , and proofs of their optimality for average - cost criteria usually use the existence of stationary optimal policies for discounted criteria , when the discount factor increases to 1 .",
    "this is the so - called vanishing discount factor approach . in particular",
    ", this approach can be used to establish the validity of optimality equations ( sometimes called canonical equations ) and inequalities for mdps with long - run average - costs .",
    "average - cost optimality equations and inequalities imply the existence of optimal stationary policies for long - run average costs . in applications , average - cost optimality equations and inequalities",
    "can be written without an explicit use of the vanishing discount factor approach by using general results on the validity of average - cost optimality equations and inequalities for mdps . however , as mentioned above , this approach is typically used in the theory of mdps to establish the validity of such equations and inequalities .",
    "let us discuss optimality conditions for mdps that are general enough to provide optimality conditions for broad classes of inventory control models .",
    "first , the state space should be an unbounded subset of a euclidean space .",
    "this level of generality is covered by borel state spaces ( more precisely , borel subsets of complete separable metric spaces ) .",
    "euclidean spaces are examples of borel spaces , and the general theory of mdps with euclidean state spaces is not simpler than for borel spaces . similarly to subsets of euclidean spaces , borel spaces are either finite , countable , or have the cardinality of the continuum .",
    "a reader , who is not familiar with the notion of borel spaces , may view all the state and action sets in this tutorial as subsets of euclidean spaces .",
    "second , the cost functions may be unbounded .",
    "more precisely , the cost functions should be inf - compact as a function of two variables : a state and action .",
    "for inventory control , inf - compact cost functions can be interpreted as lower - semicontinuous functions tending to infinity if either the inventory / backorder or the order size tends to infinity .",
    "cost functions may not be continuous .",
    "for example , they are not continuous in models with positive ordering costs .",
    "third , transition probabilities should satisfy the property of continuity in distribution , also known under the name of weak continuity .",
    "in particular , transition probabilities are typically weakly continuous for periodic - review stochastic inventory control problems with arbitrary demand distributions ; see feinberg and lewis  ( * ? ? ? * section 4 ) for details . in particular ,",
    "it is explained there , that the case of setwise continuous transition probabilities , which is often considered in the mdp literature , typically covers only discrete and continuous demand distributions .",
    "fourth , action sets may be unbounded .",
    "this corresponds to a potentially unlimited production / supply capacity .",
    "for example , if a production / supply capacity is limited , then @xmath0 policies may not be optimal ; see e.g. , federgruen and zipkin  @xcite and shaoxiang  @xcite .    for discounted costs , shapley",
    "@xcite introduced a zero - sum two - person stochastic game with finite state and action sets .",
    "if one of the players has only one action at each state , this model becomes an mdp .",
    "this publication is considered as the first paper on mdps .",
    "blackwell  @xcite developed the theory for discounted costs and borel state and action sets .",
    "in particular , blackwell  @xcite studied problems with bounded costs and discovered that the objective functions may not be borel measurable , and the dynamic programming approach to such problem should deal with more general policies than borel measurable ones .",
    "the appropriate theory is developed in bertsekas and shreve  @xcite .",
    "schl  @xcite developed the theory for discounted costs , borel state spaces , compact action sets , possibly unbounded above cost functions , and continuous transition probabilities .",
    "results for two types of continuity are obtained in @xcite : for setwise and weak continuity .",
    "the results on weak continuity are more important for applications and more complicated .",
    "the theory for problems with setwise continuous transition probabilities and possibly noncompact action sets is described in hernndez - lerma and lasserre  @xcite . feinberg and lewis  @xcite provided results for discounted mdps with weakly continuous transition probabilities , possibly uncountable action sets , and inf - compact cost functions .",
    "feinberg et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the notion of @xmath1-inf - compact functions and obtained more general results than in @xcite ; see theorem  [ prop : dcoe ] , which is a version of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) adapted in @xcite to problems with possibly nonzero terminal costs .    for average costs per unit time blackwell  @xcite and derman",
    "@xcite established the existence of stationary optimal policies for the case of finite state and action sets .",
    "derman  @xcite and taylor",
    "@xcite introduced optimality equations for infinite - state problems with bounded one - step costs .",
    "these equations and their version for multi - chain problems are called canonical in dynkin and yushkevich  @xcite .",
    "sennott  @xcite introduced optimality conditions that lead to the validity of optimality inequalities whose solutions define stationary optimal policies ; see also @xcite and the references therein .",
    "cavazos - cadena  @xcite provided an example when optimality inequalities do not hold in the form of equalities .",
    "schl  @xcite extends sennott s results to borel state spaces , compact action spaces , and with weakly and setwise continuous transition probabilities .",
    "hernndez - lerma  @xcite generalized schl s",
    "@xcite results for setwise continuous transition probabilities to possibly noncompact action sets .",
    "feinberg and lewis  @xcite provided sufficient optimality conditions for weakly continuous transition probabilities and possibly noncompact action sets .",
    "feinberg et al .",
    "@xcite provided results for weakly continuous transition probabilities that generalize the corresponding results in schl  @xcite and feinberg and lewis  @xcite ; see subsection  [ ss2 ] below .",
    "the second topic covered in this tutorial is optimality conditions for pomdps and , in particular , for inventory control problems with incomplete information on inventory levels .",
    "research on inventory management with incomplete information was pioneered by bensoussan et al .",
    "@xcite , where particular problems are studied and the existence of optimal policies and convergence of value iterations are established . in general , for pomdps there is a well - known reduction , introduced by aoki  @xcite , strm  @xcite , dynkin  @xcite , and shiryaev  @xcite of a pomdp to an mdp whose states are posterior probabilities of the states of the original process .",
    "this reduction holds for problems with borel state , action , and observation sets , and with measurable transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "however , it provides little information about the existence of optimal policies and the validity of optimality equations .",
    "this reduction is based on bayes formula , which has an explicit form only for problems with transition functions that are either discrete or have densities . as a result , except the case of finite state , action , and observation sets , very little was known on the existence of optimal policies for pomdps .",
    "therefore , the common approach is to study applications by problem - specific methods .",
    "the general approach , applicable to a large variety of applications , for verifying optimality conditions for pomdps is developed in feinberg et al .",
    "@xcite , and one of the applications there deals with inventory control . the general optimality results on pomdps are presented in section  [ s6 ] , and an application to inventory control is presented in section  [ s7 ] .",
    "an mdp is defined by a tuple @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the state space , @xmath4 is the action space , @xmath5 is the transition probability , and @xmath6 is the one - step cost function . the state space @xmath3 and action space @xmath4 are both assumed to be borel subsets of polish ( complete separable metric ) spaces .",
    "if an action @xmath7 is selected at a state @xmath8 then a cost @xmath9 is incurred , where @xmath10 and the system moves to the next state according to the probability distribution @xmath11 on @xmath12 the function @xmath6 is assumed to be bounded below and borel measurable , and @xmath5 is a transition probability , that is , @xmath13 is a borel function on @xmath14 for each borel subset @xmath15 of @xmath16 and @xmath11 is a probability measure on the borel @xmath17-field of @xmath3 for each @xmath18    the decision process proceeds as follows : at time @xmath19 the current state of the system , @xmath20 , is observed .",
    "a decision - maker decides which action , @xmath21 , to choose , the cost @xmath9 is accrued , the system moves to the next state according to @xmath22 and the process continues .",
    "let @xmath23 be the set of histories for @xmath24 a ( randomized ) decision rule at epoch @xmath25 is a regular transition probability @xmath26 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 in other words , ( i ) @xmath29 is a probability distribution on @xmath30 where @xmath31 and ( ii ) for any measurable subset @xmath32 , the function @xmath33 is measurable on @xmath34 a policy @xmath35 is a sequence @xmath36 of decision rules .",
    "moreover , @xmath35 is called non - randomized if each probability measure @xmath29 is concentrated at one point .",
    "a non - randomized policy is called markov if all decisions depend only on the current state and time .",
    "a markov policy is called stationary if all decisions depend only on the current state .",

    "a policy @xmath35 is called _ optimal _ for the respective criterion if @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "the defined model is too general for the existence of optimal policies .",
    "however , optimal policies exist under modest conditions , which typically hold for inventory control applications .",

    ", when @xmath744 for @xmath745 , orders with negative sizes are infeasible , and , if an order is placed , the ordered amount of inventory should be positive .    as mentioned above , some states ( inventory levels ) @xmath746 are observable and some are not .",
    "let the inventory be stored in containers . from a mathematical perspective , containers are elements of a finite or countably infinite partition of @xmath714 into disjoint convex sets , and each of these sets is not a singleton .",
    "in other words , each container @xmath747 is an interval ( possibly open , closed , or semi - open ) with ends @xmath748 and @xmath749 such that @xmath750 , and the union of these disjoint intervals is @xmath751 in addition , we assume that @xmath752 for some constant @xmath753 for all containers , that is , the sizes of all the containers are uniformly bounded below by a positive number .",
    "we also follow the convention that the 0-inventory level belongs to a container with end points @xmath754 and @xmath755 , and a container with end points @xmath748 and @xmath749 is labeled as the @xmath756-th container @xmath747 .",
    "thus , container @xmath757 is the interval in the partition containing point 0 .",

    "in addition each container is either transparent or nontransparent .",
    "if the inventory level @xmath181 belongs to a nontransparent container , the i m only knows which container the inventory level belongs to .",
    "if an inventory level @xmath181 belongs to a transparent container , the i m knows that the amount of inventory is exactly @xmath763 see figures  [ inventory_knownlevel][inventory_unknownzerolv ] .                    for each nontransparent container with end points @xmath748 and @xmath749",

    "of course , the distribution of this level can be computed .",
    "let @xmath780 be the euclidean distance on @xmath781 @xmath782 for @xmath783 . on the state space @xmath714 we consider the metric @xmath784 if @xmath21 and @xmath785 belong to the same container , and @xmath786 otherwise , where @xmath787 .",
    "the space @xmath788 is a borel subset of a polish space ( consisting of closed containers , that is , each finite point @xmath748 is represented by two points : one belonging to the container @xmath774 and another one to the container @xmath747 ) .",
    "we notice that @xmath789 as @xmath685 if and only if @xmath790 as @xmath685 and the sequence @xmath791 belongs to the same container as @xmath41 for a sufficiently large @xmath272 .",
    "thus , convergence on @xmath3 in the metric @xmath792 implies convergence in the euclidean metric .",
    "in addition , if @xmath793 for all containers @xmath761 , then @xmath789 as @xmath685 if and only if @xmath794 as @xmath795 therefore , for any open set @xmath15 in @xmath788 , the set @xmath796 is open in @xmath797 we notice that each container @xmath774 is an open and closed set in @xmath798    it is possible to show that the state transition law @xmath618 given by is weakly continuous in @xmath799 .",

    "if all the containers are nontransparent , the observation set @xmath806 is countable , and conditions of corollary  [ cor : main1 ] hold .",
    "in particular , the function @xmath807 is continuous , if the metric @xmath802 is considered on @xmath12 if some containers are transparent and some are not , the conditions of corollary  [ cor : main1 ] hold . to verify this , we set @xmath808 and @xmath809 and",

    "the described conditions imply the existence of optimal markov policies in finite - horizon problems and the existence of optimal stationary policies for infinite - horizon problems .",
    "they imply the validity of optimality equations , convergence of value iterations , and continuity properties of value functions for discounted costs .",
    "they also imply the validity of optimality inequalities for average costs per unit time .    for discounted costs , these conditions consist of two assumptions : the transition probabilities are weakly continuous , and the one - step cost function is @xmath1-inf - compact .",
    "these two assumptions practically always hold for periodic - review stochastic inventory control problems .",
    "the @xmath1-inf - compactness property of one - step costs is weaker than inf - compactness , which typically holds for cost functions for inventory control problems .",
    "one of the reasons for the generality of the results is that their derivation is linked to a new maximum theorem , which extends berge s maximum theorem to possibly noncompact action sets .",
