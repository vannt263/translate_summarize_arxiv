    "in the past decades atom - based metrology has had an enormous impact on science , technology and everyday life .",

    "atom - based field measurement has clear advantages over other field measurement methods because it is calibrating - free , due to the invariance of atomic properties .",
    "atom - based metrology has recently expanded into electric - field measurement .",
    "an all - optical sensing approach employed by numerous groups is electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) of atomic vapors , utilizing rydberg levels  @xcite to measure the properties of the electric field .",
    "rydberg atoms are well - suited for this purpose owing to their extreme sensitivities to dc and ac electric fields , which manifest in large dc polarizabilities and microwave - transition dipole moments  @xcite .",
    "developments include measurements of microwave fields and polarizations  @xcite , millimeter waves  @xcite , static electric fields  @xcite , and sub - wavelength imaging of microwave electric - field distributions  @xcite . in the frequency range from 10 s to 100 s of mhz ,",

    "accurate calibration of the electric field is important , for instance , for antenna calibration , characterization of electronic components , etc .",
    "conventional calibration with field sensors that involve dipole antennas ( that need to be calibrated first ) obviously leads into a chicken - and - egg dilemma  @xcite . in the present work we provide an atom - based calibration method for vector electrometry of rf - fields using rydberg - eit in cesium vapor cells .",
    "the basic idea is that the rf generates a series of intersections between levels in the rydberg floquet map ( a map in which field - perturbed floquet level energies are plotted versus rf electric field ) .",
    "the ( anti-)crossings occur between floquet states originating in fine - structure components of @xmath4 states with equal principal and angular - momentum quantum numbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "specifically , we measure the rf - dressed cs  60@xmath0 states via rydberg - eit spectroscopy at a test frequency of 100  mhz . the dependence of the floquet spectrum on the strength and the polarization of the rf field is investigated .",
    "there are exact crossings between states of different @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are not coupled in a linearly polarized rf field .",
    "the crossings provide field markers , which we use to calibrate the field strength in a test rf transmission system .",
    "we also analyze narrow , spectroscopically resolved anti - crossings between floquet states of equal @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) , and different @xmath10 and @xmath9 . transitions between those states are allowed via an rf raman process .",

    "the coupling and probe lasers have the same linear polarization in the @xmath27 plane .",
    "the angle @xmath14 between the laser polarizations and the rf field ( which points along the @xmath12-axis ) is varied by rotating the polarization of the laser beams with @xmath13/2 plates , as seen in fig .  1  ( a ) .",

    "the auxiliary eit signal is employed to locate the 0-detuning frequency reference point for all eit spectra we show ; it allows us to correct for small frequency drifts of the coupling laser .",
    "the rf voltage amplitude , @xmath37 , provided by a function generator ( tektronix afg3102 ) , is applied to the electrodes as shown in fig .  1  ( a ) , and the rf electric - field vector , @xmath11 , points along @xmath12 ( blue arrow in fig .  1  ( a ) ) .",
    "the rf frequency is fixed , @xmath22 = 2@xmath29100  mhz , and the rf field amplitude , @xmath38 , is varied by changing @xmath37 .",
    "the rf - field ac - shifts the rydberg levels and generates even - order modulation sidebands ( see fig .  1  ( b ) ) .",
    "the rf field amplitude @xmath38 is approximately uniform within the atom - field interaction volume . using a finite - element calculation ,",
    "we have determined that the average electric field in the atom - field interaction region is @xmath39 of the field that would be present under absence of the dielectric glass cell ( _ i.e. _ the glass shields @xmath40 of the field ) .",
    "the glass cell further gives rise to an @xmath41 field inhomogeneity along the beam paths within the cell .",
    "the rf transmission line between the source and the cell has unavoidable standing - wave effects .",
    "while the standing - wave effect is hard to model due to the details of the experimental setup , which are fairly complex from the viewpoint of rf field modeling , the setup still constitutes a linear transmission system .",
    "therefore , for any given frequency and fixed arrangement of the wiring and the electromagnetic boundary conditions , the magnitude of the voltage amplitude that occurs on the rf field plates follows @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a frequency - dependent transmission factor that is specific to the details of the rf transmission line .",
    "as discussed in detail in section  [ sec : measurements ] , we use the atom - based field measurement method to determine the transmission factor to be @xmath44 .",
    "the average rf electric - field amplitude , @xmath38 , averaged over the atom - field interaction zone inside the cell , is then related to the known voltage amplitude , @xmath37 , generated by the source via @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the distance between the field plates ) . in this relation ,",
    "the only factor that is difficult to determine is the transmission factor @xmath43  @xcite .",

    "the bottom eit spectrum is obtained with the rf - free reference setup .",
    "the @xmath57 main peak in the reference spectrum defines the 0-detuning position . since the value of the @xmath55 fine structure splitting ( 318-mhz arrow in fig .",
    "2 ) is well known , the spacing between the zero - field @xmath55 fine structure components is used to calibrate the detuning axis .",
    "the top two curves show eit spectra for applied rf field strengths @xmath58  v / cm and 0.504  v / cm .",
    "the @xmath58  v / cm plot illustrates the rf - induced ac stark shifts in weak rf - fields .",
    "the degeneracy between the @xmath2 = 1/2 , 3/2 , and 5/2 magnetic substates of the @xmath55 levels becomes lifted .",
    "( the quantization axis for @xmath2 is the direction of @xmath59 in fig .  1  ( a ) .",
    ") since the rf field frequency is much lower than the kepler frequency ( 35  ghz for cs 60@xmath60 ) , the ac shifts in weak rf fields are near - identical with @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the dc polarizabilities of the @xmath63 states , and @xmath64 is the rf root - mean - square field .",
    "this has been verified with a dc stark shift calculation ( not shown ) . at higher fields , rf - induced even - harmonic sidebands for @xmath65 appear , which are marked with magenta circles in the top curve of fig .",
    "the sidebands come in pairs , the lower - frequency component has @xmath66 , the higher - frequency one @xmath7 .",
    "the lines that do not shift much throughout fig .",
    "2 are the @xmath67 states ; these have near - zero polarizability .",
    "the ac shifts and sideband separations are on the same order as the fine structure splitting of 60@xmath0 .",
    "this similarity in energy scales is important because it gives rise to the level crossings in the floquet maps discussed below .",
    "we have performed a series of measurements such as in fig .  2 over an @xmath38-field range of 0 to 0.76  v / cm , in steps of 0.006  v / cm .",

    ", we numerically calculate rydberg eit spectra using floquet theory , with results shown in fig",
    ".  3  ( b ) . for details of the floquet calculation",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "a central point of the present work is that the @xmath70 level , which has near - zero polarizability and ac stark shift , undergoes a series of crossings with the @xmath71 = 1/2 , 3/2 modulation sidebands .",
    "the crossings are exact because the linearly polarized rf field does not mix quantum states of different @xmath2 .",
    "the crossings can be measured with about @xmath72 precision . as an example , in fig .",
    "3  ( a ) we show a zoom - in of the first level crossing .",
    "the crossing is centered at @xmath73  v / cm , with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath74  v / cm , corresponding to a relative uncertainty of @xmath75 .",
    "the uncertainty is mostly attributed to the intrinsic eit linewidth , which increases with increasing coupling and probe rabi frequencies .",
    "laser linewidths and interaction - time broadening also contribute to the observed linewidths .",
    ".the columns show , in that order , the crossing number , the calculated electric field @xmath38 for the crossing , the experimental electric field @xmath76 the atoms would be exposed to for an rf amplitude transmission factor @xmath77 , and the transmission factor @xmath78 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "3 six such crossings are visible within the rectangular boxes . with the rf - source voltage amplitudes @xmath79",
    "at which the crossings are observed , and recalling that the glass cell shields @xmath40 of the electric field from the atoms , the electric field the atoms would experience for an amplitude transmission factor of 1 would be @xmath80 .",
    "the ratios between the known ( theoretical ) electric fields where the crossings actually occur , @xmath81 , and the @xmath82 yield six readings for the amplitude transmission factor , @xmath83 . in table  1",
    "it is seen that the @xmath84 have a very small spread and do not exhibit a systematic trend from low to high field .",
    "the average , @xmath85 , is the desired calibration factor for the experimental electric - field axis .",
    "the @xmath86axis in fig .",
    "3  ( a ) shows the calibrated experimental electric field , @xmath87 , with voltage amplitude @xmath37 at the source .",
    "the overall relative uncertainty of the atom - based rf - field calibration performed in this experiment is @xmath3 , similar to what has been obtained in  @xcite and about an order of magnitude better than in traditional rf field calibration  @xcite .",
    "the use of narrow - band coupling and probe lasers , lower rabi frequencies , and larger - diameter laser beams is expected to reduce the uncertainty to considerably smaller values .",
    "we note that the calibration uncertainty achieved in this work is based on matching experimental and calculated spectroscopic data at the locations of a series of six isolated level crossings that all occur within a narrow spectral range of less than 50  mhz width ( see rectangular boxes in fig .  3 ) .",
    "hence , a fairly small amount of spectroscopic data suffices for the presented atom - based rf field calibration . from fig .  3 it is obvious that this advantage traces back to a specific feature of cesium @xmath88 states , namely that these states offer a mix of magnetic sublevels with near - zero and large ac polarizabilities .",
    "rf - dressed rydberg - eit spectra of rubidium atoms do not present a similar advantage  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 we further observe three series of avoided crossings , which are due to an rf - sideband of the @xmath10 level intersecting with an rf - sideband of the @xmath89 level .",
    "the first number in the avoided - crossing labels in fig .",
    "3  ( b ) shows the number of rf photon pairs taken from the rf field to access the @xmath10 band , while the second shows the number of rf photon pairs taken from the rf field to access the @xmath89 band .",
    "negative rf photon numbers , indicated by underbars , correspond to stimulated rf - photon emission .",
    "the coupling between the intersecting @xmath10 and @xmath89 bands is a two - rf - photon raman process in which the atom absorbs and re - emits an rf photon while changing @xmath1 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , or vice versa .",
    "this is a second - order electric - dipole transition , which , for the given polarization , has selection rules @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in fig .  3 ,",
    "three series of avoided crossings that satisfy these selection rules are visible , one for @xmath92 and two for @xmath93 .",
    "each series has a fixed @xmath38-value and consists of copies of the same avoided crossing along the @xmath94-axis , in steps of 200  mhz .",
    "the @xmath93 series are particularly easy to spot because one of the two intersecting floquet states has near - zero polarizability .",
    "the raman coupling causing the avoided crossings equals the minimal avoided - crossing gap size . for fixed floquet - state wavefunction ,",
    "the raman coupling strength should scale as @xmath95 . for",
    "the @xmath93 avoided crossings at 0.319  v / cm we observe a coupling strength of 8.6  mhz , while those at 0.579  v / cm have a coupling strength of 19.3  mhz .",
    "the coupling - strength ratio , which is 2.2 , is somewhat smaller than the @xmath95-ratio , which is 3.3 .",
    "the deviation indicates a moderate variation of the floquet - state wavefunctions between 0.319  v / cm and 0.579  v / cm ( which is expected ) . from a field - calibration point of view",
    ", the avoided crossings and other details in the spectra could be used to further reduce the uncertainty in the atom - based rf - field calibration factor @xmath43 , which is planned in future work . comparing the cesium and rubidium level structures , it is again noteworthy that cesium offers a combination of @xmath2-dependent polarizabilities that is particularly favorable for this purpose .    in the top curve in fig .  2",
    "it is noted that the @xmath96 and @xmath97 floquet states are narrow and symmetric , whereas the other floquet lines are much wider and are asymmetrically broadened .",
    "further , the @xmath7-lines exhibit a shoulder on the high - frequency side ( see @xmath98mhz marker in fig .",
    "2 ) , while the @xmath66-lines have no shoulder .",
    "the scan in the top curve of fig  2 also corresponds to the vertical dashed line in fig .",
    "3  ( b ) .",
    "close inspection of fig .  3",
    "( b ) reveals that the shoulders of the @xmath7-lines are due to the series of narrow avoided crossings between floquet states in the @xmath7-manifold .",
    "the shoulders correspond to the weaker , higher - frequency component of the crossing .",
    "the asymmetric line broadening of the wide lines is due to the @xmath99 full - width variation of the rf field within the atom - field interaction zone .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath66-lines we estimate for the inhomogeneous linewidth @xmath100mhz , which is close to the observed width of @xmath101  mhz .",
    "( the @xmath7-lines are also inhomogeneously broadened , but we do not give a broadening estimate for those lines because of the interference with the mentioned avoided crossing . )",
    "[ thb ]   defined in the text at an rf field of @xmath102=0.415  v / cm , as a function of polarization angle @xmath14 .",
    "the data are for the indicated values of the probe rabi frequency .",
    "the inset shows sample eit spectra for @xmath103 and @xmath104.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    rydberg - eit spectra generally depend on the laser polarizations  @xcite .",
    "this also applies to rf - modulated rydberg eit spectra . here",
    ", we study the dependence of line - strength ratios on the angle @xmath14 between the rf - field and the polarization of the laser beams ( both laser beams are linearly polarized , and the polarizations are parallel to each other ; see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for a line - strength comparison of floquet levels of different @xmath2 it is advantageous to choose an electric field close to one of the exact crossings discussed above , because the two lines of interest will then appear in close proximity to each other , allowing for a rapid measurement .",
    "additionally , since states with different @xmath2 do not mix , the line - strength measurements are robust against small variations of the rf electric field . as an example , the inset in fig .",
    "4 we show the rf eit spectra for @xmath105 ( lower curve ) and @xmath104 ( upper curve ) at an rf field @xmath102= 0.415  v / cm , marked with a dashed line in the left panel in fig .  3  ( a ) .",
    "the two peaks labeled a1 and a2 within the blue square in the inset in fig .  4 correspond to the floquet levels marked with red circles in fig .",
    "3  ( a ) .",
    "the peak a1 , which corresponds to the @xmath106 rf band of the @xmath107 floquet state , increases with the angle @xmath14 , whereas the peak a2 , which corresponds to the @xmath108 rf band of the @xmath109 state , decreases with @xmath14 . to quantify this polarization - angle dependence",
    ", we introduce the parameter @xmath110 , where @xmath111 represent the respective areas of gaussian peaks obtained from double - gaussian fits to the spectra at angle @xmath14 . since the intersecting lines have different differential dipole moments , it is important to use the areas and not the peak heights ( see discussion in the last paragraph in sec .  [",
    "subsec : spectroscopy ] ) .",
    "figure  4 shows @xmath112 as a function of the @xmath14 at @xmath102=0.415  v / cm for the indicated probe laser rabi frequencies , together with the corresponding line strength ratio obtained from floquet calculations ( the floquet calculation yields line strengths valid for the case of low saturation , @xmath113 ) .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the measurements and calculations for @xmath28 = @xmath114 9.2  mhz .",
    "curves such as in fig .",
    "4 can be used to measure the polarization of an rf - field with unknown linear polarization .",
    "the angle uncertainty can be estimated as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the difference between experimental and calculated values of @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the derivative of the calculated curve .",
    "for the lowest - power case in fig .  4 , straightforward analysis shows angle uncertainties below @xmath119 for @xmath120 . in the domain @xmath121 the angle uncertainty gradually increases from @xmath119 to @xmath122 because the derivative becomes small .",
    "we note that this method of polarization measurement has the advantage of being both simple and very fast , since the areas of only two lines need to be measured . at the expense of reduced acquisition speed",
    ", the uncertainty could be improved by measuring line - strength ratios of multiple line pairs and by averaging over a number of spectra .    the data for higher probe rabi frequencies in fig .  4",
    "show a more significant deviation from the calculated curve .",
    "this is not unexpected , because the calculation is for negligible saturation of the probe transition , whereas the data in fig .",
    "4 vary between moderate and strong saturation of the probe transition .",
    "in addition to saturation broadening effects , there may also be optical - pumping effects  @xcite that could affect the line strength ratio .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we have demonstrated a rapid and robust atom - based method to calibrate the electric field and to measure the polarization of a 100  mhz rf field , using rydberg eit in a room - temperature cesium vapor cell as an all - optical field probe .",
    "the eit spectra exhibit rf - field - induced ac stark shifts , splittings and even - order level modulation sidebands .",
    "a series of exact floquet level intersections that are specific to cesium rydberg atoms have been used for calibrating the rf electric field with an uncertainty of @xmath3 .",
    "the dependence of the rydberg - eit spectra on the polarization angle of the rf field has been studied .",
    "our analysis of certain line - strength ratios has led into a convenient method to determine the polarization of the rf electric field .",
    "the rydberg - eit spectroscopy presented here could be applied to atom - based , antenna - free calibration of rf electric fields and polarization measurement .",
    "it is anticipated that an extended analysis of all exact and avoided crossings as well as other spectroscopic features will significantly lower the calibration uncertainty .",

    "<S> the calibration method is based on matching experimental data with the results of a theoretical floquet model . </S>",
    "<S> the utilized 60@xmath0 fine structure floquet levels exhibit @xmath1- and @xmath2-dependent ac stark shifts and splittings , and develop even - order rf - modulation sidebands . </S>",
    "<S> the floquet map of cesium 60@xmath0 fine structure states exhibits a series of exact crossings between states of different @xmath2 , which are not rf - coupled . </S>",
    "<S> these exact level crossings are employed to perform a rapid and precise ( @xmath3 ) calibration of the rf electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we also map out three series of narrow avoided crossings between fine structure floquet levels of equal @xmath2 and different @xmath1 , which are weakly coupled by the rf field via a raman process . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling leads to narrow avoided crossings that can also be applied as spectroscopic markers for rf field calibration . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that the line - strength ratio of intersecting floquet levels with different @xmath2 provides a fast and robust measurement of the rf field s polarization . </S>"
