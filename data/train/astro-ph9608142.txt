    "the redshift distribution of @xmath0-selected samples is less well determined than that of optical samples . in order to model the redshift distribution ,",

    "the theoretical curves give reasonable fits to the combined dataset , except perhaps at higher redshifts , where in any case the observed redshift distribution is less well determined .",
    "a further constraint on the form of the redshift distribution is the scaling of the amplitude of @xmath6 with apparent magnitude between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 samples . in table",

    "we have presented angular correlation functions , @xmath6 , for galaxies selected in the @xmath29band over a large area of sky .",
    "we find that @xmath6 is well fitted by a @xmath1 power law on small angular scales , as observed for optically selected galaxies .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath30 reduction in the amplitude of clustering for a faint magnitude slice , @xmath4 , compared with galaxies with @xmath3 .",
    "this behaviour can be reproduced assuming the redshift distribution predicted by a simple no evolution model , if the correlation length of galaxies with a median redshift of @xmath31 is around @xmath32 whilst for galaxies at a lower median redshift of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and clustering is fixed in proper coordinates .",
    "we find no consistent change in the strength of clustering in the different fields when galaxies are selected by their observed @xmath5 colours , but this is does not rule out a dependence of clustering amplitude on colour in samples of higher median redshift ( landy _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) .",
    "the measured clustering contributes to the uncertainty in the number counts ( gardner _ et al _ 1996 ) because different patches of sky contain different numbers of galaxies depending upon whether they are in high or low density regions .",
    "the integral constraint @xmath35 gives an indication of the fractional variance in the number counts ( see peebles 1980  36 ) .",
    "taking into account the fact that we have two widely separated fields , the rms variance at @xmath3 is @xmath36 whilst for @xmath4 @xmath37 .",
    "these values are upper limits , though tests with simulated catalogues that have the same clustering show that these numbers would be reduced by @xmath38 .",
    "the contribution to the variance in the counts from galaxy clustering is several times larger than that expected from poisson statistics alone .",
