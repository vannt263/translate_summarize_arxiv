    "the reasons for searching for and studying extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) at radio wavelengths are many .",
    "first , to provide another means of direct detection of egps , second , if a detection with sufficient strength is made , it will provide evidence of the presence and indeed strength of the magnetic field of the egp .",
    "many current planet - finding techniques are indirect in nature , relying on seeing the effect of the planet on the host star ( such as the doppler , transit , astrometric or microlensing methods ) . in the future , direct detection of the planet may be made using space - based interferometric techniques , or through coronographic techniques .",
    "radio detection provides another possible means of directly observing the planet ( or the planet s near environment ) .    in principle",
    ", the detection of radio emission could also provide information on the existence of any satellites around the egp , the rotation period , and indeed provide constraints on the inclination of the egp ( though these last reasons are very speculative and will require high quality observations ) . for the time being , mere detection of egps at radio wavelengths is a sufficiently worthwhile goal .",
    "the solar system object that leads to the expectation that egps may be detectable at radio wavelengths is jupiter ( and , to a lesser extent , the other planets that have been detected at radio wavelengths , namely the earth and the other jovian planets ",
    "see bastian , dulk & leblanc 2000 ) . at decameter wavelengths",
    ", jupiter is an extremely bright source , detectable with very modest equipment . at these wavelengths",
    "the sun / jupiter contrast can be @xmath2 and indeed the polarised nature of the emission from jupiter ( and we expect from egps ) will allow discrimination as to whether the emission is planetary or stellar in origin .",
    "we shall discuss the jovian radio emission in section  [ sec1p1 ] .",
    "the radio emission from the solar system planets is related to their magnetospheres , and a radio detection of an egp will give direct evidence of a magnetosphere .",
    "however , indirect evidence for a planetary magnetosphere has already come to light in the case of hd179949b ( shkolnik , walker & bohlender 2003 ) , where variations in the caii h and k lines seem to be phase locked with the orbit of the planet ( which has a period of 3.093  days and a mass of @xmath3 ) .",
    "a number of other stars with short period egps were also studied in the same way with no other comparable results .",
    "hd  179949 is more distant than the sample covered in this paper ( at a distance of @xmath4  pc ) , but because of the inferred existence of a magnetosphere we will include it in the sample discussed below",
    ".      in the magnetospheres of planets , intense radio emission can result from electron cyclotron maser radiation . in",
    "this process kev electrons in the auroral regions of the planet radiate at the gyro - frequency of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the radiation is emitted in a hollow cone region , and is highly structured in time and frequency .",
    "the requirements for this process are simply a magnetic field and a source of energetic ( kev ) electrons .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field will be extremely likely in egps , and we would expect the magnetic moment of the more massive egps to exceed that of jupiter ( section  [ sec2p4p1 ] ) . the energetic electrons can be provided by a range of means ( in the case of solar system objects ) ; the solar wind , auroral processes or planet - moon magnetic coupling ( in the case of io / jupiter ) and there is no reason to expect this to be different for egps . the electron - cyclotron maser emission is seen to be very sporadic in the case of jupiter and the other planets , and the emission is 100% circularly or elliptically polarised . for a discussion of the extremely variable s - burst decametric emission and the rather more slowly varying l - type emission , see queinnec & zarka ( 2001 ) .    in the case of jupiter",
    ", the peak emission occurs at a frequency of @xmath5  mhz ( though it is seen to extend up to @xmath6  mhz ) , while for the other magnetised planets it is at correspondingly lower frequencies , in the range of @xmath7  mhz . for planets other than jupiter ,",
    "this emission is not observable from the ground ( with the ionospheric cut - off typically in the range of @xmath8  mhz , depending on the location on earth , day or night , location in the solar cycle etc ) , and were detected by space - based instruments .",
    "jupiter has also been detected as a radio source at higher ( ghz ) frequencies , but at a much lower level .",
    "one further constraint , is that the local plasma frequency in the source region must be lower than the gyro - frequency , which is the case for most solar system objects .",
    "the exception to this is probably mercury , where the local plasma frequency in the solar wind exceeds the gyro - frequency ( the surface magnetic field at the equator is @xmath9  g ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec3 ] , there will also be issues with this associated with planets with stronger magnetic fields immersed in more dense stellar winds , or orbiting at very close distances to the host star .",
    "for an overview of the emission mechanisms and the radio properties of the solar system planets see bastian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and references therein .",
    "there have been a small number of reported searches ( or related proposals for searches ) for radio emission from extrasolar planets , with no detection as yet .",
    "the searches reported include :    1 .",
    "winglee , dulk & bastian ( 1986 ) used the very large array ( _ vla _ ) to observe six nearby stars at 333 and 1400  mhz .",
    "these objects are not part of the current list of egp hosts ( with the possible exception of lalande  21185 ) .",
    "none were detected .",
    "2 .   bastian et al .  ( 2000 ) reported on _ vla _ observations of a range of egp and brown dwarf candidates at 333  mhz and 1465  mhz , with a smaller number of observations at 74  mhz .",
    "the relevant objects covered included 51  peg , ups  and , 55  cnc , 47  uma , tau  boo , 70  vir and lalande  21185 . these object were all observed at 333  mhz and 1465  mhz , while 47  uma was also observed at 74  mhz . of these ,",
    "the 74  mhz observations are the most relevant and the _ rms _ noise level for the non - detection the 47  uma observation was quoted as 76  mjy for the entire observing run and 3.24  jy for a 10  sec period ( important if the emission is extremely variable , which if jupiter is anything to go by , is likely to be the case ) .",
    "3 .   farrell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) observed tau  boo with the _ vla _ at 74  mhz , with a quoted upper flux limit of 0.12  jy ( see also farrell , desch & zarka 1999 for an earlier analysis of the likely radio emission from tau  boo ) .",
    "4 .   ryabov , zarka & ryabov ( 2003 ) reported on progress on observations of egps , using the utr-2 array in the ukraine .",
    "observations of 20 nearby egps have been undertaken with no detections reported so far .",
    "5 .   while not a search as such , butler ( 2003 ) reports on the prospect of radio detection of egps with upcoming instruments such as the square kilometer array ( _ ska _ ) or the low - frequency array ( _ lofar _ ) .",
    "we shall discuss these observational limits on the radio emission from egps , in the light of the new predictions presented here , in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is set out as follows : in section  2 , the basic theory of radio emission from egps is introduced , including a discussion of the influence of the planetary parameters and characteristics of the stellar winds of the host star on magnetospheric radio emission from egps ; in section  3 , the results from the modelling are presented , and in section  4 , these results are discussed , along with comments on the likely observability of the radio emission from egps .",
    "as noted by zarka et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , following on from work by desch & kaiser ( 1984 ) and zarka ( 1992 ) , the level of planetary radio emission is proportional to the kinetic flux intercepted by the planetary magnetosphere , and , as a consequence of the frozen - in field condition , also proportional to the incident magnetic energy flux .",
    "bastian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have also reported on results based on this relationship , termed the `` radiometric bode s law '' for the solar system .",
    "if the incident solar wind kinetic flux on the planetary magnetosphere is @xmath10 and the incident magnetic energy flux on the magnetosphere is @xmath11 , and the emitted radio power from the planet is @xmath12 , then this relationship states that :    @xmath13    with @xmath14 an efficiency parameter , with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 with @xmath17 another efficiency parameter , with @xmath18 .    the similar form of these relationships is a consequence of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the solar wind scaling as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distance from the star , and so that the magnetic energy flux scales as @xmath21 .",
    "the kinetic flux scales as @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 the wind density and @xmath24 the wind velocity ) . for a spherical and constant velocity wind",
    "then this scales as @xmath21 as well .    as noted by zarka et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the high apparent efficiency of conversion of magnetic energy density into radio power might suggest that the conversion of incident magnetic energy , via reconnection , into particle acceleration ( resulting in particles following the magnetic field lines towards the planet ) is the process that actually leads to the radio emission .    based on this relationship",
    "we will generalise the expected radio power from solar system planets for arbitrary planetary and stellar parameters .      in order to investigate the expected properties of known egps we shall concentrate on the nearest egps , where we will have the greatest possibility of detection , and where the x - ray fluxes for a reasonable fraction of the host stars are known .",
    "the nexxus database is the most comprehensive database of x - ray data on nearby stars and contains data on stars out to a distance of 25  pc ( see section  [ sec2p5p1 ] for a fuller discussion of the use of this database ) .",
    "we will concentrate on those egps that lie within 20  pc , and provide estimates of the relevant stellar and planetary parameters and from these infer likely radio properties . in table  1 and table  2",
    "we list the details of the host stars and the egps that lie within 20  pc of the earth , and in the following sections we shall describe the derivation of the values in these tables .",
    "we shall also include results for hd179949 , which although lying outside of 20  pc , has been inferred to have a magnetosphere via other means ( shkolnik et al .",
    "2003 ) .      in order to have a description of the expected radio power from the magnetospheres of exoplanets we need to describe the properties of the host star ( stellar wind properties such as mass - loss rate and velocity and magnetic field strength ) , and the properties of the exoplanets ( planetary mass , radius , magnetic moment and orbital parameters ) .",
    "we also need to introduce two important frequencies that will enter into the discussion of the expected radio emission .",
    "the first is the characteristic frequency of a plasma ( referred to as the plasma frequency ) :    @xmath25    with the electron density @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "the plasma frequency provides a lower frequency limit for the propogation of electromagnetic radiation ; that is radiation with a frequency lower than the local plasma frequency will be screened out by the plasma .",
    "the second is the electron gyro - frequency ( or electron cyclotron frequency ) : @xmath28 with the magnetic field strength @xmath29 in gauss .",
    "the gyro - frequency is important as it relates to the frequency of the peak radio emission ( see section  [ sec2p4 ] ) .",
    "the plasma frequency will also be important as it sets a lower limit on the frequency , whereby waves with a frequency below the plasma frequency will be screened out .",
    "this will be important in the context of egps in very close orbits or with stars with high mass - loss rates .    for the basic stellar properties of the host star",
    ", we assume that we have a star of mass @xmath30 , radius @xmath31 , effective temperature @xmath32 and equatorial magnetic field @xmath33 , which is located at a distance @xmath34 from the earth .",
    "we shall consider the situation in a very general manner , though in practice we shall mostly concentrate on the stellar types of stars with known egps , namely main - sequence f , g , k and m - stars , which will have coronally driven winds , similar to that of the sun .",
    "we shall assume that the stellar wind of the star has a mass - loss rate of @xmath35 and a wind velocity of @xmath24 ( in the case of short - period planets the wind velocity will not be the terminal velocity , see section  [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "of course , mass - loss from stars tends not to be isotropic , and this is certainly true of the sun and probably true of most stars . however , for simplicity ( and for the order of magnitude arguments being employed here ) we shall stick with spherically symmetric winds .    except in the inner regions of the heliosphere , the magnetic field",
    "is dominated by the azimuthal component , and so that if the surface magnetic field is @xmath33 , stellar radius is @xmath31 , and the angular frequency of the stellar rotation is @xmath36 , then the magnetic field at a radius @xmath20 is given by    @xmath37    and so that the magnetic energy ( @xmath38 ) scales as @xmath21 .",
    "this will not be the case in the inner wind region , where the radial component will begin to dominate , with    @xmath39    the radius at which the azimuthal component starts to dominate depends on the stellar rotation rate ( as well as things like the wind velocity ) , and some of the more interesting systems in the sample are rapid rotators ( this is because they are interesting from a radio point of view due to high x - ray activity , which in turn is related to youth and rapid rotation ) .",
    "for instance , barnes ( 2001 ) quotes a rotation period of 3.2 days for tau boo .",
    "this means that in these cases the azimuthal magnetic field will start to dominate at correspondingly smaller radii .    as discussed by zarka et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the inclusion of the radial field component makes the magnetic field strength rise more sharply as the radius decreases , than if we just included the azimuthal field , which in turn should make the anticipated radio flux rise more steeply ( though with some limited exceptions ",
    "see zarka et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this paper",
    "we shall just include the azimuthal field in our estimations .",
    "this assumption is appropriate for the longer period planets and should be on the conservative side for the shorter period planets .",
    "we assume that the star is orbited by an egp .",
    "the planet is assumed to orbit with a period @xmath40 , at a distance @xmath41 from the star .",
    "we shall assume that all planets have a circular orbit for the time being , so that @xmath41 is equal to the orbital semi - major axis of the planet ( which we denote as @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is clearly a poor assumption given that most egps have eccentric orbits , with the eccentricities extending up to @xmath43 .",
    "we will discuss the impact of orbital eccentricity in section  [ sec3p2 ] .",
    "the planet is assumed to have a mass @xmath44 , radius @xmath45 and magnetic moment @xmath46 .    from the radiometric bode s law ( and following zarka et al .",
    "2001 ) we have that the emitted radio power is proportional to both the magnetic energy and kinetic flux incident on the magnetosphere , so that    @xmath47    with @xmath48 and @xmath49 the magnetospheric radius of the planet .",
    "this equation can also be written as @xmath50 with @xmath51 , with @xmath23 the stellar wind density , with @xmath52 with @xmath35 the stellar mass - loss rate .    we are beginning to have some knowledge of the mass - loss rates of the host stars of egps , with the x - ray surface flux being an indicator , and so we have an indication of the stellar wind ram - pressure ( section  [ sec2p5 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand we have little knowledge of the surface magnetic fields of these stars .",
    "consequently , we shall use the form of the radiometric bode s law , involving the incident kinetic flux , with the same value of @xmath14 as for the solar system .",
    "we note that we are effectively assuming that @xmath53 , and this will be universal for stars other than our sun .",
    "this assumption leads to the following relationship , that    @xmath54    so that an increase in the stellar mass - loss rate of a factor @xmath55 corresponds to an increase in stellar surface magnetic field of @xmath56 ( all other things being equal ) .    returning to the overall picture",
    ", the planetary magnetospheric radius ( @xmath49 ) will be a function both of the planetary magnetic moment @xmath46 and the stellar wind characteristics , with    @xmath57^{1/6}\\propto m_e^{1/3}{\\dot m_\\ast}^{-1/6 } v_w^{-1/6 } a^{1/3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the density and velocity of the stellar wind at the radius of the planet , and @xmath58 is a constant .",
    "we determine the magnetospheric radii of the egps by assuming that the magnetospheric radius of jupiter is @xmath59 , and scale accordingly according to stellar mass - loss rate and planetary distance from the star ( and assuming @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "the kinetic flux of the stellar wind intercepted by the magnetosphere of the planet , orbiting at a radius @xmath41 , can be written as    @xmath62    and consequently the expected emitted radio flux from the planet ( @xmath12 ) will be @xmath63 substituting in for @xmath49 , this leads to the following scaling relationship , @xmath64 so , for example , although moving a planet closer means that the stellar wind density scales as @xmath65 , the planetary magnetosphere size reduces as well , partially offsetting this increase .",
    "the same process occurs for increasing the mass - loss rate and so on .",
    "the flux detected at earth will obviously have an additional @xmath66 dependency .",
    "for jupiter , we shall assume a peak in the emission at 10  mhz , and a flux density of @xmath67  jy at an equivalent distance of 1  au ( bastian et al.2000 ) .",
    "based on this , for each egp we can estimate the expected radio flux and peak frequency for this flux .",
    "the planetary parameters required to estimate these values are discussed below . in estimating the expected flux from these egps we obviously have to include the distance @xmath34 of the host star from the earth .",
    "as discussed earlier , in the case of jupiter the surface magnetic field strength plays a crucial role in the decametric radio emission .",
    "assuming a magnetic moment of @xmath68  g  @xmath27 , a planetary radius of @xmath69  cm and a dipole field , the jovian equatorial magnetic field strength is @xmath70 g , which corresponds to an electron cyclotron frequency of @xmath71  mhz , which corresponds roughly to the frequency of the peak radio emission from jupiter .",
    "based on this we will assume that the peak radio emission from egps will occur at a frequency @xmath72 , which we assume corresponds to the electron cyclotron frequency of the surface equatorial magnetic field of the egp .",
    "we do note that this is rather a simplistic assumption and that for planets in our own solar system there are substantial deviations from a centred dipole field , with the gas giants having the largest deviations  for instance the ratio of maximum to minimum surface magnetic field should be 2 for a centred dipole , and it is 4.5 for jupiter and 12 for uranus ( de pater & lissauer 2001 ) .",
    "the planetary quantities that will affect this frequency will be the planetary magnetic moment and the planetary radius .",
    "we will discuss the likely values for these two quantities for egps below .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath46 of the egp is an important parameter , as @xmath46 is key in setting the size of the planetary magnetosphere @xmath49 , which plays a major role in the expected level of radio emission and in setting the frequency cut - off of the radio emission ( determined by the maximum magnetic field strength near the planetary surface ) .",
    "currently , we have very little information about the expected magnetic moments for egps ( see snchez - lavega 2004 ) , and we are forced to extrapolate from solar system values .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left panel ) we plot the planetary magnetic moments ( @xmath46 ) versus planetary mass for objects in the solar system .",
    "this plot omits the deviant points of mars and venus ( where we can resort to arguments about low planetary mass or lack of rotation , though these do not seem to apply to mercury , which is perhaps the really deviant point on this graph ) .",
    "we note a very clear correlation , and for comparison we also plot a line with @xmath73 .",
    "note , this line is not a fit , merely a schematic representation .",
    "if we do a formal fit for these six points then we find a best - fit slope of @xmath74 . if we do a fit for the five points , excluding mercury ( which does seem to be a little discrepant in this diagram )",
    ", then we find a best - fit slope of @xmath75 ( which is essentially identical to that plotted ) .",
    "we note that for solar system planets ( particularly the 4 jovian planets ) , the planetary density is roughly constant , and so that @xmath76 , and that this relationship could equally be @xmath77 .",
    "similar related trends have been noted by arge , mullan & dolginov ( 1995 ) , who looked at the correlation between magnetic moment ( which they quantified as @xmath78 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath79 ) for a wide range of bodies ( solar system , low and high mass stellar objects , white dwarfs , pulsars etc ) . in these relationships @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the mass and radius of the bodies respectively",
    ", @xmath80 is the polar field strength at the bodies surface , @xmath81 is the rotation frequency and @xmath58 is a constant that depends on the mass distribution within the body ( and is typically in the range of @xmath82 for bodies ranging from normal stars to compact objects ) .",
    "this relationship was first noted in the context of the solar system by blackett ( 1947 ) , and has been referred to as the `` magnetic bode s law '' .",
    "arge et al .  (",
    "1995 ) noted a very clear correlation between @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the solar system objects and the stellar objects with @xmath85 , with @xmath86 .",
    "taking this relationship and transferring into the terminology used here for egps , we then have    @xmath87    for the solar system objects ( with the exception of mercury ) the values of @xmath88 are similar ( with rotation periods in the range of @xmath89hours ) . indeed , because the range in magnetic moment for the solar system objects spans so many orders of magnitude , even the difference between the angular frequency of mercury and the fastest rotating planet ( a factor 140 or so ) does not change the overall trend .",
    "if we plot @xmath46 versus @xmath90 instead of @xmath44 we get a plot with a slope close to unity ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the line plotted in this diagram is not a fit , but a schematic line with slope unity , plotted so that it passes through the value for jupiter .",
    "again , if we do a formal fit to all six points we find a best - fit slope of @xmath91 , and excluding mercury ( as per the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , then we find a best - fit slope of @xmath92 .",
    "both of these fitted slopes are unity ( within errors ) .    for massive egps",
    "( with @xmath93 ) their radius varies very slowly with mass , and indeed , in many models , shows a slow decrease with increasing mass ( see section  [ sec2p4p2 ] ) .",
    "this means that we can assume that @xmath94 , based on the values within the solar system , but also on the more general analysis of arge et al.(1995 ) .",
    "the more massive stellar objects in the sample of arge et al.(1995 ) show the same basic scaling with mass , but in fact the absolute values of the magnetic moment are higher than for the solar system objects .",
    "we might expect this relationship not to hold true for very close in egps , which are tidally locked to their host star ( see section  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we assume that the planetary magnetic moment for egps is proportional to the planetary mass .",
    "currently , from the doppler solutions , all we have are values of @xmath95 , with @xmath96 the orbital inclination of the planet .",
    "as noted by halbwachs ( 1987 ) , for a randomly distributed sample , neglecting selection effects , then the distribution function of the inclinations @xmath96 will be @xmath97 .",
    "trimble ( 1974 ) , in the context of stellar binary systems , used a mean value of @xmath98 to investigate the mass distribution of the component stars .",
    "as discussed by halbwachs ( 1987 ) and heacox ( 1995 ) , this simplistic approach does have some severe limitations ( to say the least ) when used to determine the mass distributions of the component stars , and in the context of egps much better statistical methods are available ( for example , jorissen , mayor & udry 2001 ) . however , for the purposes required for this paper , where we want to estimate values for individual planets , this simplistic method is still not an unreasonable approach .",
    "so , in order to have an estimate of the real masses for all the egps listed in table  2 , we simply assume a mean value of the inclination , such that @xmath99 , corresponding to an inclination of @xmath100 . we note that we could perhaps improve this flawed approached by adopting @xmath101 or @xmath102 ( see halbwachs 1987 ) , but these different assumptions gives mean values of @xmath103",
    "only a few percent different , and not enough to make a difference to the conclusions of this paper , and the value we have assumed lies neatly between them    we note that with this value of @xmath96 some of the planets are relatively low - mass , with masses as low as @xmath104 . here",
    "the assumption of @xmath105 may also be a slight overestimate , though we note that saturn , even with a mass of @xmath106 , has a radius of @xmath107 . leaving this aside , with this assumption we can then determine an estimate of the planetary mass , and hence the planetary magnetic moment ( see table  2 ) .",
    "some additional comments about individual planetary systems are made in section  [ sec3p1 ] .    as a final comment , very recently snchez - lavega ( 2004 )",
    "has published a more detailed physical model of the expected magnetic moments of egps .",
    "this analysis supports the notion that egps will have strong magnetic moments , and justifies the scaling of the planetary magnetic moment with planetary mass , that is seen empirically .",
    "further , this model includes the effects of planets with a range of different rotation periods .",
    "snchez - lavega ( 2004 ) concludes that young , massive and rapidly rotating egps are likely to have surface fields in the range of @xmath108  g , while for the older planets ( or those that are in short - period orbits and are orbitally synchronised ) the surface magnetic fields will be @xmath2  g.      the egp radius will be an important quantity in the radio emission from egps , entering in to the consideration of the expected frequency of the peak radio emission .",
    "there is currently very little hard observational information on the radii of egps , and none for planets which are not `` hot jupiters '' .",
    "one example where there is data is hd209458 , where the determined radius is @xmath109 ( for a planetary mass of @xmath110 , see cody & sasselov 2002 and burrows , sudarsky & hubbard 2003 ) . however , this planet is a very short period planet ( a class  v `` roaster '' in the terminology of sudarsky et al .",
    "for the three currently known transiting ogle planets ( ogle - tr-56 , 113 and 132 ) , the respective masses and radii are @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( ogle - tr-56 ) , @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( ogle - tr-113 ) , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( ogle - tr-132 , bouchy et al .",
    "all 4 planets have very short period orbits and are strongly heated and their radii will almost certainly be greater than that of a more distantly orbiting egp .",
    "zapolsky & salpeter ( 1969 ) discussed the mass - radius relationship for cold spheres for masses appropriate for planetary systems and pointed out that there are substantial differences in the derived radii depending if the object is hydrogen rich or has a metallic core .",
    "they also showed that the mass - radius relationship has a peak at a mass around that of jupiter .",
    "there have subsequently been a large number of more detailed calculations of the radius of egps , and we shall adopt the results of baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to provide estimates of the egp radius . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot results from the models of baraffe et al.(2003 ) for egp models with ages of 1 , 5 and 10  gyr .",
    "what we see is that for a wide range of masses the radii of the egps are close to that of jupiter ( within 10 per cent or so ) .",
    "given the intrinsic uncertainties in our knowledge of the actual masses of the egps , we shall ( for simplicity ) adopt a radius of @xmath117 for all the egps considered .",
    "most of the planets listed in table  2 are not extremely close objects , but some of the important ones are : for example , the shortest period planet is tau  boob ( 3.3 days ) , and here we might expect this planet to have a radius larger than that assumed here ( orbital radius of 0.05  au ) .",
    "the assumption that egps in the mass range @xmath118 have a constant planetary radius means that the surface magnetic field rises linearly with planetary mass @xmath44 ( as magnetic moment scales with planetary mass ) , and so that the likely frequency of peak emission @xmath119 ( which in turn is an important observational consideration ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      extrasolar planets have been , and are expected to be , discovered around a wide range of stellar types .",
    "the initial discovery , of extrasolar planets orbiting a pulsar psr  b1257 + 12 , remains perhaps the most unexpected ( wolszczan & frail 1992 ; see konacki & wolszczan 2003 for a more recent analysis of the results ) .",
    "we note that sigurdsson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have recently announced the discovery of a planet mass object and a white dwarf orbiting the pulsar psr  b1620 - 26 .    since this initial discovery , extrasolar planets have been discovered around a range of stars of stellar type f , g , k and m , and the vast majority of which are main - sequence objects . however , there are now detections of egps around giant stars , such as iota draconis ( k2iii ; frink et al .",
    "2002 ) and hd104985 ( g9iii ; sato et al .",
    "2003 ) , and there are a number of stars around sub - giants .",
    "in addition to these normal stars it is expected that white dwarf stars should also host egps , and several techniques for finding such egps have been proposed , both in the optical ( burleigh , clarke & hodgkin 2002 ; chu et al .",
    "2001 ) and in the radio ( willes & wu 2004 ) . to date no such planet has been found , but it seems likely that they will exist .",
    "the stellar types of the host stars of egps under consideration here also range from f to m type stars . for the stellar masses and radii for the host stars of the egps listed in table  1",
    ", we use a variety of sources , including santos et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , santos , israelian & mayor ( 2004 ) , and the stellar radii are determined using values for @xmath120 from these sources , and bolometric corrections calculated from flower ( 1996 , see also gaidos 1998 ) , and the barnes & evans relationship ( see barnes , evans & moffett 1978 ) .      from our own solar system",
    ", there appears to be an intimate connection between the characteristics of the the solar wind and magnetospheric planetary radio emission . from this",
    "we would then expect a similarly strong connection between the stellar wind characteristics of the host star and the egp radio emission . in order to predict the radio properties of egps we need to understand the mass - loss properties of the host stars .",
    "stellar winds from stars come with a wide range of characteristics ( and driving mechanisms ) :    1 .   fast ( @xmath121 ) radiatively driven winds from early - type stars , 2 .",
    "slow ( tens of ) , massive winds from red giants and supergiants , agb stars etc , that are driven by pulsations and radiative driving of dust , 3 .   moderately fast ( @xmath122 ) but",
    "diffuse winds from lower mass coronally active stars , such as the sun .",
    "while , in principle , the analysis presented here is applicable to any stellar wind , the host stars of the egps under consideration will have coronally driven winds and we shall concern ourselves with these winds .    because of the extremely low mass - loss rates , it has hitherto been very difficult to estimate the mass - loss rates of solar - type stars .",
    "this is in contrast to the ob stars where radio and uv observations can give good measures of both the mass - loss rate and wind velocity ( see dougherty et al .",
    "2003 ) .    for the solar - type stars ,",
    "the dominant wind driving mechanism is associated with a hot corona , as in the sun .",
    "there is a wide range of coronal properties , with stellar youth leading to much higher levels of x - ray emission . naively , one would expected the mass - loss from such stars to scale , in some way , with coronal x - ray emission ( which in turn is a good indicator of coronal activity ) . recently , wood et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have quantified the connection between stellar x - ray emission and the expected mass - loss rate , through high resolution hubble space telescope lyman@xmath14 observations of nearby coronal stars .",
    "the observed x - ray emission from single stars can be understood in terms of two different origins , depending on the mass of the star . for high mass stars ,",
    "the x - ray emission is believed to be associated with shocks within the radiatively driven stellar winds of massive stars ( berghofer , schmitt & cassinelli 1996 ) while for lower mass stars , relevant to egps here , the x - ray emission is believed to come from a hot corona , analogous to the situation seen in the sun .",
    "the first mechanism is applicable to o and early b - type stars , and it is unclear what the origin for the x - ray emission seen from late b - type through to early f - type stars is , though it could well often be related to binarity .",
    "the outer convection zone of stars disappears in stars earlier than spectral type f5 , and this is argued to be the reason for the drop of coronal activity around this spectral range ( stauffer et al .",
    "1994 ) , and so the coronal mechanism for x - rays is applicable for late f stars , through g and k - stars down to m - stars . the earliest spectral type in our sample is f7v ( tau  boo ) and so all of our stars will be coronally emitting .    it is worth noting that the x - ray properties of coronally emitting stars depend very sensitively on rotation , which in turn depends on age , with younger stars typically being much more rapid rotators and much more x - ray luminous than older stars ( though there may well be some exceptions , possibly in the f - stars ",
    "see suchkov , makarov & voges 2003 ) .",
    "we parameterise the mass - loss rates of the stars in the sample using the results of wood et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and we estimate the total mass - loss rate from the star ( @xmath35 ) from    @xmath123 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{f_x}{f_{x,\\odot}}\\right]^{1.15\\pm 0.20}\\ ] ]    with @xmath124 the mass - loss rate of the sun ( @xmath125 ) and @xmath126 the solar x - ray surface flux ( @xmath127  erg  @xmath128  s@xmath129 ) . note that in wood et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the quoted mass - loss rates are sometimes the mass - loss rates per unit area , whereas here we always use the total mass - loss rate of the star , integrated over the entire surface .",
    "we have used the nexxus database to investigate the host star x - ray properties ( schmitt & liefke 2004 ) .",
    "the values of the x - ray luminosity and surface flux for the host stars are shown in table  1 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities range over 2 orders of magnitude from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , with an even greater range in surface flux . using the relationship given above we",
    "can now easily determine the overall mass - loss rates for those stars detected at x - rays , and these too are given in table  1 .",
    "we see a large range in mass - loss rates , from @xmath132 for gliese  876 , up to @xmath133 for hd147513 , with a number of stars undergoing significantly stronger mass - loss than the sun .",
    "the x - ray non - detections in this table probably mean that the stars are relatively faint x - ray sources and are thus unlikely to have winds substantially stronger than that of the sun .",
    "this in turn means that they are unlikely to harbour radio bright egps .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec2p3 ] , the expected radio emission from egps scales as @xmath134 , and so those stars with the higher mass - loss rates provide potentially very interesting targets .",
    "another issues concerns the velocity of the winds , with the radio flux emitted by an egp being @xmath135 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have any information about the expected wind velocities of these stars , and we resort to assuming a velocity of @xmath61 for all stars in the sample ( though see wood et al .",
    "2003 for a discussion of this assumption ) .",
    "we note that cuntz , saar & musielak ( 2000 ) used an earlier version of an x - ray / mass - loss relationship to estimate the energy flux due to the magnetic interaction of the stellar wind with the egp .",
    "we have collected together all of the necessary data to estimate the expected radio fluxes from nearby egps , and these are listed in table  2 .",
    "what we can see is that while many of the egps have very low levels of expected radio emission , there are a number with levels greater than 5  mjy .",
    "these are ( in order of expected levels of emission ) , tau  boo , gliese  86 , hd179949 , ups  and and hd1237 , with tau  boo far and away the brightest .",
    "we also predict that hd179949 should be a ( relatively ) bright radio source ( and hence to have strong magnetospheric emission ) , given the indirect detection of a magnetosphere ( shkolnik et al .",
    "however , it should also be noted that shkolnik et al.(2003 ) also observed tau  boo in the same manner and found no comparable effect ( and we predict that system to be a brighter radio source ) .",
    "if we consider the tau  boo system , then from our analysis there are 4 factors that make it so bright :    1 .",
    "the proximity @xmath136  pc ) of the star to earth , 2 .",
    "the orbital distance of the planet from the star ( @xmath137  au ) , 3 .",
    "the mass of the planet ( @xmath138 ) , and the corresponding magnetic moment , and 4 .",
    "the high mass - loss rate of the star ( @xmath139 ) .    given that @xmath140 , for the case of tau  boob we find that , compared to jupiter , the closer orbital distance of the planet contributes a factor of 450 in increased radio flux , the increased mass - loss rate a factor 19 and the higher planetary mass , a factor 4 .",
    "this leads to tau  boob being nearly a factor @xmath141 times brighter than jupiter , but nearly @xmath142 times more distant .",
    "the important point is that while the enhanced mass - loss from tau  boo makes a major difference , the dominant reason that tau  boob is expected to be a bright radio source is its orbital distance ( 0.05  au ) .",
    "indeed , all bar one of the five brightest egps are in short period orbits .",
    "the exception is hd1237b , which has a period of 134 days , and a semi - major axis of 0.5  au ( and an eccentric orbit ) .",
    "the next longest period of the brightest planets is gliese  86b , with a period of 16 days ( and a semi - major axis of 0.11  au ) .",
    "however , all of the bright egps do have host stars with winds substantially stronger than the sun , and so that to generate a detectable radio flux a short period massive planet , orbiting a coronally active star is required .",
    "this is an important point and will enable the identification of possible radio egps , using known properties from the orbital solution and x - ray data .",
    "we note that the expected flux from tau  boob is in conflict with the quoted value for a _ vla _ 74  mhz observation ( 120  mjy , farrell et al.2003 ) .",
    "one problem with the short period egps is that they violate at least one assumption used in the derivation of the radio flux , namely of a wind velocity of @xmath143 .",
    "these planets orbit so close to the host star ( to within @xmath144 or so ) , that wind will not have reached terminal velocity . because the radio emission depends on the incident ram - pressure flux this will have a big impact ( in addition , the magnetospheric structure of close in egps will be very different from that of the jovian planets in the solar system  ip et al.2004 ) . because the radio flux scales as @xmath145 , a reduction in velocity by a factor 2 results in a radio flux lower by a factor 3 .",
    "as discussed by zucker & mazeh ( 2002 ) and by udry , mayor & santos ( 2003 ) there is now evidence that there is a deficit in the number of high mass planets ( with @xmath146 ) with short orbital periods ( @xmath147  days ) .",
    "this is the case for planets orbiting single stars ( which makes up the bulk of the currently known sample ) , but the opposite ( i.e. an excess of high mass planets in short period orbits ) seems to be true for planets in binary stellar systems , pointing towards different formation / migration mechanisms ( though the number of examples in this second category is small ) . as discussed here , massive planets in short period orbits is exactly the situation required for significant radio emission , and so , to some extent , is selected against by nature .",
    "this will have implications for the use of radio surveys in detected egps .",
    "it is worth noting that of the expected radio brightest systems , both tau  boo and gliese  86 are binary systems , and of the other stars in our sample , eps  eri is also a reported binary .",
    "another consideration is the effect of plasma frequency in those systems with short period planets and high mass - loss rates . from eqn .",
    "( 1 ) we have    @xmath148    with @xmath41 in au , @xmath35 in units of @xmath124 and the wind velocity in units of @xmath143 . for a star with a high mass - loss rate , @xmath149 ,",
    "@xmath137  au , and @xmath150 the plasma frequency in the stellar wind at the radius of the planet is 8.5  mhz , a frequency which will impinge on the radio emission , particularly of lower mass planets .",
    "these parameters are close to what is appropriate for tau boo , and although this plasma frequency is lower than the expected peak radio emission ( @xmath151  mhz ) , it is reasonably close and means that for some lines of sight that pass even closer to the star there may be a problem with the planetary radio emission being screened out ( depending on system inclination ) , and so care should be taken when observing tau  boo to avoid the possibility of plasma frequency screening , and epochs when the planet is in front of the star are to be preferred .",
    "for a few systems , there is some additional information about the orbital solution ( specifically the inclination ) for the egp .    in the case of gliese  876 , recent _ hubble _ space telescope astrometric observations , reported on by benedict et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , have constrained the orbital inclination of the system ( or more accurately , the most massive planet gliese  876b ) .",
    "the derived value of the inclination is @xmath152 .",
    "this means that the mass of gliese  876b is @xmath153 , and the value for the planetary magnetic moment quoted in table  2 is overestimated by @xmath154 . as @xmath155 , the quoted expected radio flux for gliese",
    "876b is overestimated by @xmath156 . however , gliese  876b is not one of the brightest targets .",
    "in the case of eps  eri , gatewood ( 2000 ) report on astrometric observations , and derive an inclination of @xmath157 , with corresponds to @xmath158 , and a planetary mass of @xmath159 .",
    "this means that the values quoted for the magnetic moment for eps  erib is underestimated by @xmath160 , and the expected radio flux underestimated by @xmath156 .",
    "again , eps  erib is not one of the expected brightest radio sources .",
    "we have calculated the radio flux assuming that the planet is orbiting at the distance of the semi - major axis axis of the orbit ( i.e. @xmath161 ) .",
    "for some of the planets with large eccentricities , this will be only a rough average value .",
    "we have seen that we expect the radio flux to scale as @xmath162 , and so , for example , for hd3651b , with an eccentricity of @xmath163 , the planet will be a factor 3.8 brighter than the value quoted in table  2 at periastron , and a factor 0.5 fainter at apastron . for other planets the values are correspondingly smaller .",
    "for the radio bright egps ( with the exception of hd1237 ) , which are short period planets , the eccentricities are low ( @xmath164 at most ) .",
    "the planet orbiting hd1237 is the most interesting example , with an eccentricity of @xmath165 .",
    "this means that although the mean flux expected is 8.3  mjy , we would expect this to range from 4.8 to 21.5  mjy , making hd1237 a potentially very interesting source if observed around periastron .",
    "however , the location on the sky of hd1237 ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) means that it is not convenient for observations from either the _ vla _ or _ lofar _ ( if sited in holland ) .",
    "consequently , the influence of orbital eccentricity on expected radio emission is not predicted to be major for most of the candidate systems .",
    "however , in certain systems , such as hd1237 , it is important and should be noted when choosing to observe this system .",
    "in this paper we have presented a critical discussion of the expected radio properties of egps in the light of both the planetary and stellar characteristics of the host star . as a result of this",
    "we can make the following statements about the likely levels of egp radio emission .    1 .",
    "only very nearby egps are likely to be detected by their radio emission .",
    "the @xmath168 fall - off makes the problem very hard .",
    "there are only 28 egps currently known within 20  pc ( orbiting 22 different host stars ) and only 3 within 10  pc ( one orbiting eps eri and two orbiting gliese  876 ) .",
    "2 .   the prime factor in determining whether an egp is radio bright is its orbital period .",
    "shorter period planets will also show more radio emission , with the radio flux scaling as @xmath162 .",
    "however , this effect will not continue indefinitely as if the planet is very close to the star the incident wind will impinge on the magnetosphere at lower velocities .",
    "also , eventually plasma - frequency screening will begin to play a role for very short period planets .",
    "higher levels of radio emission are likely to be associated with more massive planets , with the radio flux scaling as @xmath169 .",
    "the frequency of the radio emission from the more massive planets will likely be shifted to more amenable wavelengths .",
    "we note that the most massive planet within 20  pc is hd39091b ( with @xmath170 ) , though we do not expect this planet to be a bright radio source , as it is in a very long period orbit .",
    "higher levels of egp radio emission are expected from stars with higher coronal x - ray surface fluxes ( and hence higher mass - loss rates ) .",
    "of the nearby stars ( within 20  pc ) a fair number have been detected at x - ray wavelengths and have mass - loss rates in the range of @xmath171 .",
    "the nearest star harbouring an exoplanet ( eps eri ) does have a strong wind , but also a long period planet , which offsets this .",
    "tau  boo , which remains the most promising candidate , also has a very strong wind , with @xmath139 , although hd1237 is another promising candidate , has @xmath172 .",
    "the peak frequency of emission in the five brightest cases range from @xmath173  mhz up to 50  mhz , though these values are uncertain . certainly , very low frequency observations will be required for a detection , with even the 74  mhz _ vla _ observations possibly being at too high a frequency . as with jupiter",
    ", we do expect emission from the egps at @xmath174 , but it will likely be falling off very rapidly . 6 .",
    "two of the five predicted brightest systems ( tau  boo and gliese  86 ) are in binary stellar systems ( there seems to be a dearth of massive planets in short period orbits in single stellar systems and the apparent opposite trend in binary systems , see zucker & mazeh 2001 ) .",
    "7 .   in some cases",
    ", orbital eccentricity may play a major role in detectability of the system .",
    "the prime example from this study is hd1237 , where the expected flux will vary by a factor 4.5 over the 134 day orbit , reaching over 20  mjy .    on the basis of the results presented here ,",
    "there remains the prospect of detecting nearby egps ( particularly with _ lofar _ or _ ska _ ) .",
    "the best candidates ( in order of expected brightness ) , with their predicted peak frequencies ) are :    1 .",
    "tau bootes ( 48  mhz ) 2 .",
    "gliese 86 ( 46  mhz ) 3 .",
    "hd179949 ( 11  mhz ) 4 .",
    "upsilon andromeda ( 8  mhz ) 5 .",
    "hd1237 ( 40  mhz )    previous searches for egps ( see section  [ sec1p2 ] ) have tended to focus on rather higher frequencies than these ( with the 74  mhz observations at the _ vla _ being the most sensitive ) .",
    "the emission from jupiter falls off very sharply with increasing frequency , which means that careful ( multi - frequency ) observations are needed .    on a positive note ,",
    "all five of these objects have fluxes that are potentially detectable , particularly with upcoming _ lofar _ telescope , which will operate at lower frequencies , more appropriate for detecting egps .. the quoted sensitivities for _ lofar _ ( for a 1 hour integration with the full array , single polarisation , 4  mhz bandwidth ) , are 3  mjy at 10  mhz , 1.6  mjy at 30  mhz and 1.0  mjy at 75  mhz ( see http://www.lofar.org ) .",
    "however , not all of them are visible from the anticipated _ lofar _ site ( hd1237 and gliese  86 are not  gliese  86 is just visible from the _ vla _ ) .",
    "the other 3 targets are visible from this site .    as a further consideration ,",
    "it is notable that shkolnik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also detected night - to - night activity on tau  bootes and upsilon andromeda , as well as hd179949 ( though in these cases the synchronicity with the planet was not obvious ) .",
    "this activity was not present in the standard stars observed , nor in the 51  peg system .",
    "this activity could also be related to magnetospheric activity .",
    "there are however , many uncertainties in this analysis , such as the extrapolations from our own solar system to extrasolar systems , in particular how the radio flux from short period systems will depend on the stellar / planetary parameters .",
    "in addition , we have assumed a scaling for the magnetic moment with mass .",
    "the close - in planets may well be rotationally locked to their host star .",
    "what this lack of rotation will do to any planetary dynamo and magnetic field is uncertain , but is likely to reduce it .",
    "if this turns out to be the case then hd1237 is perhaps the most promising target , with a reasonably long period planet ( and likely interesting orbital variability ) .    as a further consideration",
    ", the expected radio bright egps will preferentially be orbiting young , rapidly rotating and x - ray luminous stars ( with high mass - loss rates ) .",
    "this means these planets themselves will be young too .",
    "given that it may take planets a reasonable length of time to generate a self - sustaining magnetic field , it is possible that this may limit the radio brightness of egps , with increasing magnetic field strength of the egps being coupled with decreasing mass - loss rate of the host star .",
    "further study of the likely temporal evolution of magnetic fields in egps is needed .",
    "we have also assumed that the host stars are not radio emitters at similar wavelengths , but we do note that radio flare stars may well confuse the issue in some cases . this may be an issue for some m stars , but is much less likely to be an issue for f , g and k - stars ( bastian 1990 ) .",
    "in addition , while the winds of massive stars can also generate both thermal and non - thermal radio emission , the winds considered here are unlikely to be strong enough to generate any confusing emission .",
    "in addition to the expected flux , the optimum frequency to observe these sources is also uncertain .",
    "the predicted peak frequencies are around 50  mhz for tau  boo and gliese  86 ( which is still at a lower frequency than the 74  mhz observations of tau  boo ) , and rather lower for hd179949 and ups  and .",
    "the peak frequency is , however , very uncertain , and depends on the planetary magnetic moment ( and planetary mass ) , which for all of these objects is uncertain due to the @xmath103 factor ( and the assumptions made in this model ) .",
    "we have assumed a mean value of the inclination , and it could be for these objects that @xmath96 is closer to @xmath175 , which will reduce the expected flux as well as making the peak frequency difficult to observe ( though the converse is also possible , making the situation easier ) .",
    "the peak frequency also depends on the planetary radius , which we may be underestimating for the very close planets ( those with orbital separations of 0.05  au ) .",
    "gliese  86b has an orbital separation of 0.11  au , putting in the category of a class  iv egp , and so , while it is possible we are underestimating the planetary radius , the effect is likely to be less than for tau  boo .    on a positive note ,",
    "given the anticipated parameters of the _ lofar _ instrument , from the estimates presented here , there should be ample sensitivity to detect a substantial number of egps .",
    "these egps will have a range of period / mass characteristics , and thus the observations will initiate the observational study of extrasolar magnetospheres .",
    "so , in summary , we have performed a detailed analysis of the expected radio emission from nearby extrasolar giant planets . in particular ,",
    "new results allow us for the first time to be quantitative about the expected stellar wind properties of the host stars of egps , which in turn has important consequences on their radio detectability .",
    "we predict that a number of egps will emit at radio wavelengths at levels that are likely to be observable with _ lofar_. we do note that there remain a number of issues that could reduce the observability of these objects , and care should be taken when choosing to observe the candidates , but nonetheless there does remain the prospect of a detection and we have proposed the five most promising targets on which to undertake a search .",
