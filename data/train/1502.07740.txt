    "multiple theories have been offered to explain residual fluctuations in the near - infrared background ( nirb ) .",
    "after analysing images from _ spitzer_/irac @xcite and _",
    "@xcite , the authors concluded that nirb fluctuations are unlikely to result from known galaxy populations and are consistent with the earliest star formation era . on the other hand ,",
    "evaluation of nicmos images from the hubble ultra deep field ( nudf ) suggested that source - subtracted fluctuations result from normal galaxies at @xmath1 8 , with most power in the redshift range of 0.51.5 @xcite .",
    "more recently , other explanations have been proposed to account for the majority of near - infrared fluctuations , including intrahalo light ( ihl ) from dark - matter haloes @xcite and early , direct collapse black holes ( dcbhs ) as suggested by @xcite .",
    "conclusions are frequently based , in part , by the observation that nirb fluctuations measured by different instruments over a broad range of wavelengths are consistently much higher than those predicted for known populations @xcite or high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "fluctuation measurements considered in these studies include those derived from 1.6 @xmath0 m nudf observations as described by @xcite .",
    "all of these interpretations depend upon the amplitudes and shapes of observed fluctuations , which , in turn , are related to the completeness of the source - extraction process . @xcite",
    "appropriately noted that the source - subtracted nudf images analysed by @xcite included residual flux in the extended outer edges of galaxies ( wings ) .",
    "this residual flux would impact fluctuation estimates to an unknown extent and could potentially affect conclusions derived from their spectra .",
    "as described by @xcite , source subtraction for these images was deliberatively conservative to minimise the possibility of false sources appearing in their catalogue .",
    "this resulted in incomplete subtraction of detected objects with visible flux remaining in the wings of identified sources ( fig .",
    "[ im - fields]c ) . if these unsubtracted wings are a substantial component of measured fluctuations , conclusions drawn from their results might have to be reconsidered . while @xcite and @xcite showed that residual wings contributed only small amounts to the power spectra of _",
    "spitzer_/irac images , their methodology was limited by the resolution of this system",
    ". the higher resolution of _",
    "hubble_/nicmos observations allows a more robust approach for assessing these effects .",
    "this paper reanalyses the nudf images used by @xcite to quantify the contributions of these unsubtracted , extended galaxy wings to measured fluctuations .",
    "all images and tables used in this study are available online .",
    "detailed descriptions of the processing of nudf images are documented in @xcite . only overviews of portions relevant to this study are presented .",
    "nudf observations cover a @xmath2 arcsec area and are obtained with two filters centred on wavelengths of 1.1 ( f110w ) and 1.6 ( f160w ) @xmath0 m .",
    "field position on the camera is dithered by more than the average source size during separate acquisitions which results in a median image dominated by zodiacal emission @xcite . subtracting this median image from the original images effectively removes smooth background components , including the zodiacal light .",
    "images are then combined in a drizzle procedure such that the original 0.2 arcsec pixels are converted to 0.09 arcsec to match a @xmath3 binning of the 0.03 arcsec _",
    "hubble _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images .",
    "the source extraction procedure is described in @xcite and is briefly summarised here . using a process described by @xcite , all four acs and the two nicmos bands",
    "are used to identify those pixels with a sufficient signal to noise ratio to be considered part of a real source .",
    "source extraction is then done with sextractor ( se ) in the two - image mode as described by @xcite .",
    "this process uniquely identifies individual sources and their locations on the image .",
    "the acs optical images have much longer integration times than nicmos images and , therefore , identify sources not apparent in the nudf images alone .",
    "this results in more complete source detection than would be possible using only nicmos observations .",
    "a total of 4702 objects are listed in the nudf catalogue generated by se , 4276 of which remain after trimming .",
    "sources identified by this method are then subtracted ( masked ) from the image by setting their corresponding pixels to zero . as shown in fig .",
    "[ im - fields ] , this process may fail to subtract outer portions of galaxies more prominent in the nicmos images .",
    "detector quantum efficiency is less at 1.1 @xmath0 m than at 1.6 @xmath0 m causing signals from the outer regions of galaxies to blend more quickly into background noise .",
    "this makes source subtraction for the f110w image in fig .",

    "[ im - fields]c ) .",
    "fluctuation analyses are performed as described in detail in appendix a of @xcite and are similar to those used by others @xcite . the original image in units of adu s@xmath4 is converted to jy pixel@xmath4 using standard procedures for nicmos images .",
    "pixel values are then converted to w m@xmath5 sr@xmath4 by multiplying by the corresponding frequency for 1.1 or 1.6 @xmath0 m and dividing by the solid angle subtended by each pixel . each source - subtracted image",
    "is then multiplied by a normalised weighting image to account for different pixel observing times .",
    "prior to fourier transformation , the mean value of the unmasked pixels are subtracted from this result to produce an image with a mean of zero .",
    "the two - dimensional fourier transform of the resultant image , @xmath6 , is computed using an fft , where @xmath7 is the wave vector .",
    "the value of the wavenumber , @xmath8 , and the amplitude of the transform , @xmath9 , is calculated for each point in the returned array .",
    "a log - spaced vector of @xmath8 values is generated and the average value of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is computed for each of the bins defined by this vector .",
    "mean - square fluctuations , @xmath12 , is then calculated , where @xmath13 is @xmath14 converted into arcsec .",
    "mean - square fluctuations are divided by the fraction of unsubtracted pixels in the image to compensate for area lost by masking @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise noted , error bars shown in figures represent one standard deviation of the poisson errors , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of fourier elements in the associated bin . because fluctuations may be reported as the mean - square @xcite or root - mean - square ( rms ) , @xmath17 @xcite , both of these are calculated when appropriate .",
    "the contribution of unsubtracted flux in galaxy wings to total fluctuations is estimated by incrementally expanding subtracted regions ( masks ) for individual sources .",
    "while this expansion effectively eliminates residual flux in wings , the masking process itself can distort the fourier power spectra . to account for this distortion",
    ", comparisons are made to control images with the same number of unsubtracted pixels ( see section  [ ss - control ] ) .      to quantify contributions from galaxy wings over a range of brightness ,",
    "all source masks are uniformly expanded in a predefined manner .",
    "this is possible because the extraction process identifies specific objects , thereby allowing mask expansion tailored to individual source size .",
    "source mask expansions are evaluated over a range of 1.1 to 6.0 times the original source - mask pixel count .",

    "residual flux is seen extending beyond the original subtracted region .",
    "the middle panel shows that residual flux from the same object is markedly reduced after the mask area is tripled .",
    "the right panel demonstrates the expansion process in more detail for expansion factors of 1.5 , 2.0 and 3.0 .",
    "individual source masks are circumferentially extended in one pixel increments until the number of masked pixels is the desired multiple of its original value .",
    "this process will significantly over - subtract small objects where one pixel represents more than 10 per cent of the desired mask area .",
    "this problem is minimised by expanding the outermost portion of the mask on an image resampled with pixels 1/10 their original edge length using a cubic spline interpolation .",
    "these outermost pixels are then rebinned back to their original size by averaging over the 100 resampled pixels . as shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "eliminating residual flux in the wings of identified objects reduces total summed mean - square fluctuation power in 1.6 @xmath0 m images by only 6.5 @xmath22 0.3 per cent and rms fluctuations by 3.6 @xmath22 0.2 per cent .",
    "changes are significantly less at 1.1 @xmath0 m with reductions of 1.4 @xmath22 0.3 and 0.7 @xmath22 0.1 per cent , respectively .",
    "as noted above , subtracting residual flux in the 1.6 @xmath0 m images reduces mean - square and rms fluctuations by as much as 52 and 31 per cent ( fig .",

    "as discussed in section  [ ss - effects ] , and shown in figs  [ plt - exp_x3_changes ] and  [ plt - expchangescomp ] , if spectral distortions caused by the masking process itself are ignored , changes will be overestimated at angular scales larger than @xmath2110 arcsec .",
    "comparing fluctuation spectra of source - mask expanded images to control images with the same number of subtracted pixels provides a better compensation for masking effects than only correcting for source - subtracted areas . therefore ,",
    "mean - square and rms fluctuations for the mask - expanded images are calculated by multiplying their original , unexpanded values by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ plt - pubs ] , subtracting residual flux from source wings would not affect any published conclusions drawn from the previously reported nudf fluctuations . _",
    "this study has shown that faint wings of source - subtracted galaxies account for only a small portion of total nudf background fluctuation power above 0.5 arcsec . these results are generally consistent with estimates of the contributions of residual galaxy wings to spectral power in _",
    "spitzer_/irac deep images @xcite .",
    "these prior studies did not identify individual sources and galaxy wings were removed by equally increasing the size of all masked regions @xcite .",
    "radial mask expansion was limited to two pixels in order to retain enough unmasked pixels for reliable fourier analysis . the higher resolution of the nudf observations used in the present study allows residual flux to be eliminated using an algorithm that expands individual source masks proportional to the size of the underlying galaxy .",
    "this reduces the number of expanded pixels and allows a more robust analysis of the effects of galaxy wings on measured fluctuations .",
    "@xcite found a decrease of less than a few per cent in @xmath29 after radially expanding masks by two pixels while @xcite noted that in most cases the largest changes in rms fluctuations were less than the 1@xmath30 uncertainties .",
    "both of these findings are significantly less than the decreases observed in this study ( figs  [ plt - expchangescomp ] and  [ plt - pubs ] ) and probably result from a more complete source - subtraction in their original images .    a limitation to the methodology used in this study is the degree to which control images can compensate for spectral distortions caused by source - mask expansion .",
    "individual source - masks in control images have a smaller average size and a more even distribution than those in the source - mask expanded images and , therefore , will affect underlying fluctuations differently . although using control masks as generated in this study will not fully correct for spectral distortions caused by mask expansion , they do provide a better compensation than only dividing by the fraction of unmasked pixels .",
    "this is important because , as shown in figs  [ plt - exp_x3_changes ] ( upper panel ) and  [ plt - expchangescomp ] , both the magnitude of changes and the expansion factor required to eliminate wings would be overestimated if control images were not used .    the ihl model for fluctuations applied to observations from both the _ spitzer _ deep , wide - field survey ( cooray et al .",
    "2012b ) and ciber ( zemcov et al .",
    "2014 ) predicts effects becoming significant at angular scales larger than those encompassing the nudf field .",
    "yue et al .",
    "( 2013b ) fit their dcbh model for fluctuations at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m to scales @xmath31 100 arcsec and , as suggested in fig . 4 of their paper",
    ", dcbhs would have negligible contributions at 1.6 and 1.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , studies postulating ihl or dcbhs to account for the nirb did not use nudf results to support their hypotheses .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ plt - pubs ] , even the maximum decreases for mean - square and rms fluctuations are barely noticeable on a log scale .",
    "results after eliminating source wings from nudf images represent the upper limits of fluctuations at 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath0 m and continue to remain well above those predicted by models for known galaxy populations @xcite or high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "the revised fluctuation spectra presented in this paper would not affect any of these conclusions .",
    "these results exclude previous suggestions that extended wings of detected galaxies may be a major contributor to fluctuations in source - subtracted nudf images and confirm that other explanations are required to account for most of the nirb fluctuations at the angular scales of nudf observations .",
