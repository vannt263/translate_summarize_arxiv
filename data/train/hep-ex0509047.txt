    "first results of amplitude analyses of @xmath8 meson decays to a several three - body charmless hadronic final states have been reported recently : @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite . branching fractions for a number of quasi - two - body decays",
    "have been measured with some of them being observed for the first time .    in this paper",
    "we present preliminary results of a dalitz plot analysis of neutral @xmath8 meson decay to the @xmath13 three - body charmless final state .",
    "the analysis is based on a @xmath14 data sample containing 386 million @xmath1 pairs , collected with the belle detector operating at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath15 collider  @xcite with a center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy at the @xmath2 resonance ( on - resonance data ) .",
    "the beam energies are 3.5 gev for positrons and 8.0 gev for electrons . for the study of the @xmath16 continuum background , we use data taken 60  mev below the @xmath17 resonance ( off - resonance data ) .",
    "the belle detector  @xcite is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer based on a 1.5  t superconducting solenoid magnet .",
    "charged particle tracking is provided by a silicon vertex detector and a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) that surround the interaction point .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used . a 2.0 cm beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector",
    "was used for the first sample of 152 million @xmath1 pairs , while a 1.5 cm beampipe , a silicon detector and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 234 million @xmath1 pairs  @xcite .",
    "the charged particle acceptance covers laboratory polar angles between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , corresponding to about 92% of the total solid angle in the c.m .",
    "the momentum resolution is determined from cosmic rays and @xmath20 events to be @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the transverse momentum in gev/@xmath23 .",
    "charged hadron identification is provided by @xmath24 measurements in the cdc , an array of 1188 aerogel erenkov counters ( acc ) , and a barrel - like array of 128 time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) ; information from the three subdetectors is combined to form a single likelihood ratio , which is then used in kaon and pion selection .",
    "electromagnetic showering particles are detected in an array of 8736 csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) that covers the same solid angle as the charged particle tracking system .",
    "the energy resolution for electromagnetic showers is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is in gev .",
    "electron identification in belle is based on a combination of @xmath24 measurements in the cdc , the response of the acc , and the position , shape and total energy deposition ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) of the shower detected in the ecl .",
    "the electron identification efficiency is greater than 92% for tracks with @xmath28  gev/@xmath23 and the hadron misidentification probability is below 0.3% .",
    "the magnetic field is returned via an iron yoke that is instrumented to detect muons and @xmath29 mesons .",
    "we use a geant - based monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to model the response of the detector and determine its acceptance  @xcite .",
    "charged tracks are selected with a set of track quality requirements based on the number of cdc hits and on the distances of closest approach to the interaction point .",
    "we also require that the track momenta transverse to the beam be greater than 0.1  gev/@xmath23 to reduce the low momentum combinatorial background .",
    "charged tracks that are positively identified as kaons , protons or electrons are excluded .",
    "since the muon identification efficiency and fake rate vary significantly with the track momentum , we do not veto muons to avoid additional systematic errors .",
    "we identify @xmath8 candidates using two variables : the difference @xmath30 between the total reconstructed energy of a three - body combination and the nominal beam energy in the c.m .",
    "frame and the beam constrained mass @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath30 is calculated as @xmath32 where the summation is over all particles from a @xmath8 candidate ; and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are their c.m .  three - momenta and masses , respectively .",
    "since there are no @xmath35 s or photons in the final state , the @xmath30 width ( with typical value of 15  mev ) is governed by the track momentum resolution .",
    "the beam energy spread is about 3  mev and gives a negligible contribution to the total @xmath30 width .",
    "the signal @xmath30 shape is parametrized by a sum of two gaussian functions with a common mean . the @xmath30 shape for the @xmath36 background is parametrized by a linear function .",
    "the beam constrained mass variable @xmath31 is equivalent to the @xmath8 invariant mass with the measured @xmath8 candidate energy @xmath37 replaced by the beam energy @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath8 candidate momentum in the c.m .",
    "frame . the average @xmath8 meson momentum in the c.m .",
    "frame is about 0.34  gev/@xmath23  which is much smaller than its total energy .",
    "thus , the uncertainty in the measured @xmath40 gives a small contribution to the @xmath31 width , which is dominated by the beam energy spread .",
    "the @xmath31 width is about 3  mev/@xmath41 and well described by a single gaussian function . the @xmath31 width in general ,",
    "does not depend on the final state ( unless photons are included in the reconstructed final state ) .",
    "there are two sources of the background : the dominant one is due to @xmath42 ( @xmath43 and @xmath23 quarks ) continuum events that have a cross - section about three times larger than that for the @xmath44 ; the other one originates from other @xmath8 meson decays .",
    "the background from continuum events is suppressed using variables that characterize the event topology . since the two @xmath8 mesons produced from an @xmath17 decay",
    "are nearly at rest in the c.m .",
    "frame , their decay products are uncorrelated and the event tends to be spherical . in contrast , hadrons from continuum @xmath36 events tend to exhibit a two - jet structure .",
    "we use @xmath45 , which is the angle between the thrust axis of the @xmath8 candidate and that of the rest of the event , to discriminate between the two cases . the distribution of @xmath46 ,",
    "is strongly peaked near @xmath47 for @xmath36 events and is nearly flat for @xmath48 events .",
    "we require @xmath49 eliminating about 83% of the continuum background and retaining 79% of the signal events .",
    "for further suppression of the continuum background we use a fisher discriminant formed from 11 variables : nine variables that characterize the angular distribution of the momentum flow in the event with respect to the @xmath8 candidate thrust axis , the angle of the @xmath8 candidate thrust axis with respect to the beam axis , and the angle between the @xmath8 candidate momentum and the beam axis .",
    "the discriminant , @xmath50 , is the linear combination of the input variables that maximizes the separation between signal and background .",
    "the coefficients are determined using off - resonance data and a large set of signal mc events .",
    "use of the fisher discriminant rejects about 89% of the remaining continuum background with 53% efficiency for the signal .",
    "a more detailed description of the background suppression technique can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the understanding of the background that originates from other @xmath8 meson decays is of great importance in the study of charmless @xmath8 decays .",
    "we study the @xmath48 related background using a large sample of mc generated @xmath48 generic events .",
    "we find that the dominant @xmath48 related background is due to @xmath51 , @xmath52 and due to @xmath53 , @xmath54 decays .",
    "we veto @xmath51 events by requiring @xmath55  mev/@xmath41 .",
    "modes with @xmath56 contribute due to muon - pion misidentification ; the contribution from the @xmath57 submode is found to be negligible after the electron veto requirement .",
    "we exclude @xmath56 background by requiring @xmath58  mev/@xmath41 and @xmath59  mev/@xmath41 , with a muon mass assignment used here for the pion candidates . to suppress the background due to @xmath60 misidentification , we also exclude candidates if the invariant mass of any pair of oppositely charged tracks from the @xmath8 candidate is consistent with the @xmath61 hypothesis within 15  mev/@xmath41 ( @xmath62 ) , regardless of the particle identification information . the most significant background from charmless @xmath8 decays is found to originate from the decay @xmath63 followed by @xmath64 .",
    "there is also a contribution from the two - body charmless decay @xmath65 .",
    "although this background is shifted by about 0.2  gev from the @xmath30 signal region , it is important to take it into account for correct estimation of the background from continuum events .",
