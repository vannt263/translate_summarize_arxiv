    "is employed in the loop to compensate the losses of coupling and decoupling light from the rtd - pd and ld chips but can be avoided employing rtd - pd layer structures optimized for improved photo - detection response ( estimated to be @xmath44 a / w ) .",
    "the rtd - pd layer structure currently used consists of a 10 nm wide alas / ingaas / alas double barrier quantum well ( dbqw ) structure .",
    "the epitaxial layers includes two ingaalas regions surrounding the dbqw that act as light absorbing layers for wavelengths around 1.55 @xmath45 m .",
    "the ld device was a ingaasp multi - quantum - well active region with an inp : fe doped uncoated buried heterostructure and ridge mesas , with centre wavelength emission at @xmath46@xmath47 m , threshold current @xmath48 ma @xcite , and 3-db modulation bandwidth in excess of 10 ghz .    in this work , for purposes of demonstration and experimental convenience ,",
    "the data signals were injected electrically using a bias - t .",
    "the binary - coded data streams were generated using an arbitrary function generator ( tektronix afg3251c ) .",
    "the signals could be also injected optically , taking advantage of the optical input port of the rtd - pd , and therefore buffering can be achieved using either electrical or optical incoming data . by operating the system in the excitable regime close to the ndr region , one would be able to store and regenerate optical bits of information in the fibre , the empty region signaling the 0 bits and the excitable optoelectronic pulses the 1 .",
    "when these bits are re - injected into the photo - diode they trigger the generation of a new excitable cycle .",
    "this regenerative mechanism occurs after each round trip in the fibre which is extremely robust since even if the bit sequence is strongly deteriorated the all - or - none response of the excitable rtd allows for a perfect regeneration .",
    "we employed a very long optical fiber loop providing @xmath49s cavity round - trip time , @xmath1 .",
    "the time @xmath1 was chosen in order that the memory buffer is much larger than the typical excitable lethargic time , @xmath0 , of the rtd - pd - ld excitable system , where in this case the measured @xmath0 is around 500 ns .",
    "we have analyzed our experimental results in the framework of delayed feedback nonlinear dynamical model systems employing a linard equation describing the rtd - pd excitable oscillator @xcite coupled to the single mode rate equations modeling the laser intensity and its population inversion .",
    "regeneration is induced in such dynamical system by a delayed feedback term into the current source of the rtd - pd proportional to the intensity of the laser output .",
    "the linard oscillator - laser diode dynamical system is given by the following dimensionless coupled delay differential equations ( ddes ) :      equations ( [ eq : voltage])-([eq : photon ] ) represent the system of equations of the rtd - pd - ld with optical feedback control through the variable @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the time - delay with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath53 ; time is normalized to the characteristic @xmath54 resonant tank frequency , @xmath55 , hence @xmath56 .",
    "the feedback strength @xmath11 parameter depends on rtd - pd detection characteristics and the fraction of the laser optical output power reinjected into the delayed feedback loop .",
    "equations ( [ eq : voltage])-([eq : photon ] ) represent the linard oscillator where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the dimensionless voltage and current variables , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath59 describes the nonlinear i - v curve , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is a dimensionless parameter",

    "( [ eq : photon ] ) is normalized to threshold providing that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the carrier density for transparency , and @xmath66 is the threshold carrier density ; @xmath67 stands for the dimensionless laser gain saturation .",
    "the dimensionless laser diode threshold current is @xmath68 ; the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 come from the time rescaling .",
    "the prediction of such a system very good agreement with the experimental results allowing to predict a theoretical limit of operation of several gb / s for such buffer configuration . in the limit case where the pulses are broad and",

    "as such the delayed intensity @xmath72 becomes proportional to the bias of the laser device @xmath73 . as a last step , the nonlinear function @xmath74 has to be expanded in taylor series around the center of the ndr . neglecting the second order term yielding the asymmetry of @xmath75 in the expansion and cutting the expansion to third yields the fhn equations presented in the main manuscript , after further trivial rescaling .",

    "<S> we investigate a regenerative memory based upon a time - delayed neuromorphic photonic oscillator and discuss the link with temporal localized structures . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental implementation is based upon a optoelectronic system composed of a nanoscale nonlinear resonant tunneling diode coupled to a laser that we link to the paradigm of neuronal activity , the fitzhugh - nagumo model with delayed feedback .    </S>",
    "<S> self - feedback connections in neurons are common in the nervous system and are named autapses @xcite . these synapses between a neuron and a branch of its own axon are ubiquitous and have been found in the neocortex and the hippocampus , to cite but a few @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yet their purpose has remained uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> recent reports suggest that autaptic transmission neurons are involved in the long - lasting response to brief stimulation @xcite , and that this persistent activity has important implications in local feedback regulation @xcite , and working memory . on the other hand , recent progresses in multidisciplinary fields including semiconductor physics , photonics , computing and networking yielded the possibility to emulate some elementary functions of the brain using neuromorphic systems @xcite . the central goal is to reproduce neuronal synapses by interconnecting thousands of neuron - like elements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while a lot of attention has been dedicated to the network architecture of neuromorphic systems @xcite , almost no attention has being paid to the self - feedback autaptic connections providing self - localized persistence of neuronal activity .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate temporal localized structures in a bio - inspired time - delayed neuromorphic photonic system that exhibits long - lasting responses and short transients to brief stimulation that can be explored in regenerative memory and information storage . </S>",
    "<S> because we use light at telecommunications wavelengths for the regeneration of the spike - neuron signals , we anticipate the development of fast neuron - inspired optical storage interconnects and signal processing applications . </S>",
    "<S> we reduce our physical experimental system to the prototypical fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) model , a paradigm of neuronal response , complemented with a self - feedback autaptic connection , see fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis bridges our physical photonic system with the biological neuron and extend our findings to other biological , physical and engineering systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the global behavior of large - scale neural assemblies @xcite and how the brain activity produces higher cognition that can be emulated in physical neuromorphic technologies leads in particular to the question of memory and how information is stored . while , the complexity of the brain is usually ascribed to the gigantic number of axons defining the interconnections , the finite transit time of the electrical information between individual units is also a source of complexity . </S>",
    "<S> a lot of interested was devoted during the past decades to the effects of communication time delays @xcite and how they can influence the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it was shown that dynamical systems mimicking coupled neurons @xcite exhibit , instead of a steady state , stable periodic pulsating regimes where the two neurons may release energy in anti - phase , the period being related to the delay value . however , the presence of time delays in the dynamics may have a much deeper influence than to induce oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> even a _ </S>",
    "<S> single _ delayed equation is akin to an infinite dimensional dynamical system and important conceptual links between partial differential equations ( pde)s and delayed differential equations ( dde)s exist @xcite . as such , one is lead to wonder if the rich dynamics found in spatially extended systems , and in particular their ability to store information @xcite , could also exists in the temporal output of a _ single _ neuron with a delayed coupling representing an autaptic connection as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most interesting aspect of spatially extended out of equilibrium nonlinear systems is their ability to generate complex spatial shapes , e.g. turing patterns @xcite , and localized structures ( ls ) . </S>",
    "<S> because these ls coexist with the background homogeneous solution , they can be individually addressed and used as bits of information . </S>",
    "<S> localized structures appear in a dissipative environment as attractors , i.e. stable solutions towards which the system will evolve spontaneously from a wide set of initial conditions @xcite making them intrinsically robust and allowing for complex interactions . </S>",
    "<S> localized states have been widely observed in nature in systems like granular media @xcite , gas discharges @xcite , semiconductor devices @xcite , reaction - diffusion systems @xcite , fluids @xcite , convective systems @xcite and optical cavities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> neuromorphic responses were achieved in lasers @xcite and nanolasers @xcite recently and , while in principle fundamentally related to the existence of spatial degrees of freedom , localized states analogues have recently been observed in delayed dynamical systems @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> our time - delayed system consists of a nanoscale negative differential conductance device based on a resonant tunneling photo - detector ( rtd - pd ) diode set in an excitable regime and driving an integrated laser diode source ( ld ) . </S>",
    "<S> although electronic neuron - like semiconductor microstructures @xcite have been proposed , they operate at rather low - speeds ( of the order of 20 khz ) and do not possess optical input / output . the schematic diagram of our experimental neuromorphic photonic memory is depicted in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rtd - pd - ld provides a non - monotonic current - voltage ( i - v ) curve with a region of negative differential resistance , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) , in which it behaves as an excitable system . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as demonstrated in @xcite , it provides an all - or - none response characteristic of neurons . </S>",
    "<S> the rtd response drives the laser diode which produces an optical pulse .    </S>",
    "<S> excitability is a concept originally coined to describe the capacity of living organisms e.g. nerves @xcite or neurons to respond strongly to a weak external stimulus that overcome a well defined threshold . </S>",
    "<S> if the system is perturbed from its rest state , it may relax back toward it steady state in two different ways . </S>",
    "<S> if the perturbation remains below a certain threshold , the relaxation is exponential . above the threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the system has to perform a large orbit that involves the whole phase space topology before relaxing again toward the unique fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> such a relaxation is visible for instance in the lower panel of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> these two widely different transitory regimes toward an unique attractor are what defines the so - called excitability phenomenon . during its large excursion in phase space </S>",
    "<S> , the system can not respond to another perturbation which defines incidentally the so - called lethargic time @xmath0 as the temporal extend of the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> well known in physiology , this refractory period corresponds physically to the fact that a large amount of energy is released during the excitable response and may be understood as the time the system needs to recharge before being able to release another response . in neurons , this period of time occurs during the re - polarization and the hyperpolarization of the membrane potential .    in order to operate our neuromorphic photonic system as a regenerative memory </S>",
    "<S> , an optical delay line provides the temporal buffer memory that will store the bits of information as light intensity pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the excitable response of the rtd ensures the regeneration and the rectification of the signal as a special nonlinear node along the propagation loop . an erbium doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) </S>",
    "<S> is employed in the loop to control the amount of feedback coupling and compensate for the losses incurred by coupling and decoupling light from the rtd - pd and ld chips ( see methods a for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the light pulse re - injection into the rtd - pd triggers , after the round - trip in the fiber , a new electrical response in the nano - optoelectronic system thereby repeating the cycle with a period close to the optical pulse propagation time , @xmath1 , in the fiber .    </S>",
    "<S> a precise modeling of the experimental situation can be achieved within the framework of a dynamical model employing a linard equation @xcite describing the rtd - pd oscillator @xcite coupled to the single mode rate equations modeling the laser intensity and its population inversion ( see method b ) . in the absence of feedback , such an approach yields quantitative agreement with the experimental results @xcite . however , by assuming that the excitable response is slower than the relaxation oscillation frequency of the laser , one can adiabatically eliminate the laser intensity ( @xmath2 ) that becomes slaved to the current ( @xmath3 ) of the rtd . by expanding the nonlinear characteristic of the rtd at the center of the negative differential resistance , denoting @xmath4 the deviation of the voltage and assuming it is antisymmetric , one obtains exactly the fhn model , making a complete link with our time - delayed neuromorphic photonic system and the paradigm of excitability ( see method b for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fhn model @xcite represents a simplified version of the theory developed by hodgkin and huxley @xcite to study how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated . in order to allow for memory and complex dynamics , we introduce in the fhn model a delayed perturbation . as such </S>",

    "<S> such bits of information get perfectly regenerated after each period and since the mere condition for _ perfect _ regeneration is to overcome the excitability threshold , one foresees the signal healing properties and the robustness of this mechanism . </S>",

    "<S> from an application point of view , our time - delayed neuromorphic photonic memory presents the extraordinary advantage to allow writing and erasing information at a rate comparable to the nominal reading rate . as such , we believe that the possibility to harness the unique properties of the excitable response to be of great importance and to cross boundaries between specific fields . finally , the existence of the lethargic time induces an effective repulsion between nearest bits of data when they get too close , thereby ensuring signal integrity .    </S>",

    "<S> an andronov - hopf bifurcation occurs at @xmath20 where weakly nonlinear oscillations rapidly develops in large amplitude relaxation oscillations via the so called canard phenomenon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the bifurcation seems to be vertical in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]a . here , it is also important to notice that the period is a strongly evolving function of @xmath9 ( see inset in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we have been able to identify two different scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> some branches of solution like e.g. the one with @xmath41 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]b ) in red , can be disconnected from the rest of the web of solution . as such they form isolae and appear as hardly detectable saddle - node bifurcation of limit cycles . </S>",
    "<S> some other branches , like e.g. the one with @xmath42 in blue occurs as resonant neimark - sacker bifurcations over the principal branch . </S>",
    "<S> as a function of the bifurcation parameters @xmath1 and @xmath11 , we also found that disconnected branches would reconnect over the maximal order solution branch and disconnect . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the stability analysis of the periodic solutions with @xmath43 ls exhibited @xmath43 quasi - degenerated floquet multipliers close to unity , demonstrating the independence of the various ls as in @xcite .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated a regenerative memory based on the paradigm of neuronal dynamics and considering the time delay of propagation of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> we disclosed the complex bifurcation diagram from which localized bit of in formations arise from the interplay between the excitable dynamics and the time delay . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental realization comprises a monolithic integrated resonant tunneling diode photo - detector directly modulating a laser diode , and an optical fiber in a delayed feedback loop providing arbitrary large information storage capacity . </S>",
    "<S> the applications of the all - or - none response of the excitable rtd to optoelectronic logic are quite direct : by adding a second , external optical beam onto the photo - detector , one can perform an and operation between the bit buffer within the fiber and the external modulated beam . </S>",
    "<S> this novel system constitute an ideal support for bits in a buffer memory employing standard silica fibers combining several functions like storage , reshaping / healing and xor operation . </S>",
    "<S> although the present proof of concept memory operates in the mhz range , lethargic times in the few tens of ps range can be achieved by reducing the parasitics of the integrated circuit such as wire bonding connections as demonstrated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this will strongly reduce the fiber length required to realize the optical buffer and therefore dramatically increase the attainable bit rate , enabling practical applications and future monolithic photonic integration .    </S>",
