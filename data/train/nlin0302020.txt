    "in this paper we discuss the stability of steady flame fronts in channel geometry .",
    "traditionally @xcite one studies stability by considering the linear operator which is obtained by linearizing the equations of motion around the steady solution .",
    "the eigenfunctions obtained are _ delocalized _ and in certain cases are not easy to interpret . in the case of flame",
    "fronts the steady state solution is space dependent and therefore the eigenfunctions are very different from simple fourier modes .",
    "we show in this paper that a good understanding of the nature of the eigenspectrum and eigenmodes can be obtained by doing almost the opposite of traditional stability analysis , i.e. , studying the _ localized _ dynamics of singularities in the complex plane . by reducing the stability analysis to a study of a finite dimensional dynamical system",
    "one can gain considerable intuitive understanding of the nature of the stability problem .",
    "the analysis is based on the understanding that for a given channel width @xmath0 the steady state solution for the flame front is given in terms of @xmath1 poles that are organized on a line parallel to the imaginary axis @xcite .",
    "stability of this solution can then be considered in two steps . in the first step",
    "we examine the response of this set of @xmath1 poles to perturbations in their positions .",
    "this procedure yields an important part of the stability spectrum . in the second step",
    "we examine general perturbations , which can also be described by the addition of extra poles to the system of @xmath1 poles .",
    "the response to these perturbations gives us the rest of the stability spectrum ; the combinations of these two steps rationalizes all the qualitative features found by traditional stability analysis .",
    "in sec.2 we present a brief review of the stationary solutions of front propagation in channel geometries . in sec.3",
    "we present the results of traditional linear stability analysis , and show the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that we want to interpret by using the pole decomposition .",
    "4 presents the analysis in terms of complex singularities , in two steps as discussed above .",
    "a summary and discussion is presented in sec.5 .",
    "we consider a channel of transverse width @xmath2 , and of infinite extent in the longitudinal direction . a graph of a flame front propagating in this channel is defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a rescaled transversal coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "the equation of motion is given conveniently in terms of @xmath6@xcite : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is a viscosity - like parameter and the functional @xmath9 $ ] is conveniently defined in terms of the spatial fourier transform @xmath10 = |k| \\hat u(k , t ) \\ . \\label{hil } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is very useful @xcite to discuss the solutions of these equations of motion in terms of expansions in @xmath11 poles whose position @xmath12 in the complex plane is time dependent : @xmath13 + c.c.\\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\nu\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{2\\sin [ \\theta - x_j(t)]\\over \\cosh [ y_j(t)]-\\cos [ \\theta - x_j(t)]}\\ , \\label{upoles}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting ( [ upoles ] ) in ( [ eqfinal ] ) we derive the following ordinary differential equations for the positions of the poles : @xmath14^{-1}+\\big[\\cosh ( y_j+y_k)-\\cos ( x_j - x_k ) \\big]^{-1}\\bigg ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & l^2{dy_{j}\\over dt}=\\nu\\sum_{k=1,k\\neq j}^{n } \\big({\\sinh ( y_j - y_k)\\over \\cosh ( y_j - y_k ) -\\cos ( x_j - x_k ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\sinh ( y_j+y_k)\\over \\cosh ( y_j+y_k ) -\\cos ( x_j - x_k ) } \\big)+\\nu\\coth ( y_j)- l \\label{yj } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular we can find the steady state solution @xmath15 by demanding @xmath16 and stability .",
    "the solution is @xmath17\\over \\cosh [ y_j]-\\cos [ \\theta - x_s]}\\ , \\label{stat}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the real ( common ) position of the stationary poles and @xmath19 their stationary imaginary position .",
    "we need to determine the actual positions @xmath19 .",
    "this is done numerically by running the equations of motion for the poles starting from @xmath11 poles in initial positions and waiting for relaxation .",
    "a complete analysis of this steady - state solution was first presented in ref.@xcite and the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "there is only one stable stationary solution which is geometrically represented by a giant cusp ( or equivalently one finger ) and analytically by @xmath1 poles which are aligned on one line parallel to the imaginary axis .",
    "the existence of this solution is made clearer with the following remarks .",
    "there exists an attraction between the poles along the real line .",
    "this is obvious from eq.([xj ] ) in which the sign of @xmath20 is always determined by @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting dynamics merges all the @xmath22 positions of poles whose @xmath23-position remains finite .",
    "3 .   the @xmath23 positions are distinct , and the poles are aligned above each others in positions @xmath24 with the maximal being @xmath25 .",
    "this can be understood from eq.([yj ] ) in which the interaction is seen to be repulsive at short ranges , but changes sign at longer ranges .",
    "if one adds an additional pole to such a solution , this pole ( or another ) will be pushed to infinity along the imaginary axis .",
    "if the system has less than @xmath1 poles it is unstable to the addition of poles , and any noise will drive the system towards this unique state .",

    "consider a system with @xmath11 poles and such that all the values of @xmath19 satisfy the condition @xmath28 .",
    "add now one additional pole whose coordinates are @xmath29 with @xmath30 . from the equation of motion for @xmath31 , ( [ yj ] )",
    "we see that the terms in the sum are all of the order of unity as is also the @xmath32 term .",
    "thus the equation of motion of @xmath31 is approximately @xmath33 the fate of this pole depends on the number of other poles .",
    "if @xmath11 is too large the pole will run to infinity , whereas if @xmath11 is small the pole will be attracted towards the real axis .",
    "the condition for moving away to infinity is that @xmath34 where @xmath1 is given by ( [ nofl ] ) . on the other hand the @xmath23 coordinate of the poles can not hit zero .",
    "zero is a repulsive line , and poles are pushed away from zero with infinite velocity . to see this",
    "consider a pole whose @xmath19 approaches zero .",
    "for any finite @xmath0 the term @xmath35 grows unboundedly whereas all the other terms in eq.([yj ] ) remain bounded .",
    "the height of the cusp is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of positions of the poles along the line of constant @xmath22 was worked out in @xcite .",
    "we will refer to the solution with all these properties as the thual - frisch - henon ( tfh)-cusp solution .",
    "the standard technique to study the linear stability of the steady solution is to perturb it by a small perturbation @xmath36 : @xmath37 . linearizing the dynamics for small @xmath38 results in the following equation of motion @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\&+&\\nu \\partial_\\theta^2\\phi(\\theta , t)\\big ] + { 1\\over l}i(\\phi(\\theta , t ) ) \\ .",

    "accordingly simple fourier modes do not diagonalize it .",
    "nevertheless , we proceed to decompose @xmath40 in fourier modes according to , @xmath41 the last equation follows from ( [ stat ] ) by expanding in a series of @xmath42 . in these sums",
    "the discrete @xmath43 values run over all the integers . substituting in eq.([linear ] ) we get : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are entires of an infinite matrix : @xmath46 to solve for the eigenvalues of this matrix we need to truncate it at some cutoff @xmath43-vector @xmath47 .",
    "the scale @xmath47 can be chosen on the basis of eq.([akk ] ) from which we see that the largest value of @xmath43 for which @xmath48 is a scale that we denote as @xmath49 , which is the integer part of @xmath50 .",
    "we must choose @xmath51 and test the choice by the convergence of the eigenvalues .",
    "the chosen value of @xmath47 in our numerics was @xmath52 .",
    "one should notice that this cutoff limits the number of eigenvalues , which should be infinite .",
    "however the lower eigenvalues will be well represented .",
    "the results for the low order eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath45 that were obtained from the converged numerical calculation are presented in fig.1    the eigenvalues are multiplied by @xmath53 and are plotted as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we order the eigenvalues in decreasing order and denote them as @xmath54 .",
    "the figure offers a number of qualitative observations :    1 .",
    "there exists an obvious goldstone or translational mode @xmath55 with eigenvalue @xmath56 .",
    "this eigenmode stems from the galilean invariance of the equation of motion .",
    "2 .   the eigenvalues oscillate periodically between values that are @xmath0-independent in this presentation ( in which we multiply by @xmath57 ) .",
    "in other words , up to the oscillatory behaviour the eigenvalues depend on @xmath0 like @xmath58 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath59 and @xmath60 hit zero periodically .",
    "the functional dependence in this presentation appears almost piece - wise linear .",
    "the higher eigenvalues are more negative .",
    "they exhibit similar qualitative behaviour , but without reaching zero .",
    "we note that the solution becomes marginally stable for every value of @xmath0 for which the eigenvalues @xmath59 and @xmath60 hit zero .",
    "the @xmath58 dependence of the spectrum indicates that the solution becomes more and more sensitive to noise as @xmath0 increases @xcite .",
    "in addition to the eigenvalues , the truncated matrix also yields eigenvectors that we denote as @xmath61 .",
    "each such vector has @xmath47 entries , and we can compute the eigenfunctions @xmath62 of the linear operator ( [ linear ] ) , using ( [ phi ] ) , as @xmath63 eq.([linear ] ) does not mix even with odd solutions in @xmath4 , as can be checked by inspection .",
    "consequently the available solutions have even or odd parity , expandable in either @xmath64 or @xmath65 functions .",
    "the first two nontrivial eigenfunctions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are shown in figs.2,3 .",
    "it is evident that the function in fig.2 is odd around zero whereas in fig.3 it is even .",
    "similarly we can numerically generate any other eigenfunction of the linear operator , but we understand neither the physical significance of these eigenfunction nor the @xmath0 dependence of their associated eigenvalues shown in fig.1 in the next section we will demonstrate how the dynamical system approach in terms of singularities in the complex plane provides us with considerable intuition about these issues .",
    "since the partial differential equation is continuous there is an infinite number of modes . to understand this in terms of pole dynamics we consider the problem in two steps : first",
    ", we consider the @xmath68 modes associated with the dynamics of the @xmath1 poles of the giant cusp . in the second step",
    "we explain that all the additional modes result from the introduction of additional poles , including the reaction of the @xmath1 poles of the giant cusp to the new poles .",
    "after these two steps we will be able to identify all the linear modes that were found by diagonalizing the stability matrix in the previous section .      in the steady solution all the poles occupy stable equibirilium positions . the forces operating on any given pole cancel exactly , and we can write matrix equations for small perturbations in the pole positions @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    following @xcite we rewrite the equations of motion ( [ yj ] ) using the lyapunov function @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and    @xmath74 - \\sum_iy_i \\label{hil2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the linearized equations of motion for @xmath69 are : @xmath75 the matrix @xmath76 is real and symmetric of rank @xmath11 . we thus expect to find @xmath11 real eigenvalues and n orthogonal eigenvectors .    for the deviations @xmath70 in the @xmath22 positions we find the following linearized equations of motion @xmath77 in shorthand : @xmath78",
    "the matrix @xmath79 is also real and symmetric .",
    "thus @xmath79 and @xmath80 together supply @xmath81 real eigenvalues and @xmath68 orthogonal eigenvectors .",

    "we present the eigenvalues of the lowest order modes obtained from this procedure .",
    "the least negative eigenvalues touch zero periodically .",
    "this eigenvalue can be fully identified with the motion of the highest pole @xmath25 in the giant cusp . at isolated values of @xmath0",
    "the position of this pole tends to infinity , and then the row and the column in our matrices that contain @xmath25 vanish identically , leading to a zero eigenvalue .",
    "the rest of the upper eigenvalues match perfectly with half of the observed eigenvalues in fig.1 .",
    "in other words , the eigenvalues observed here agree perfectly with the ones plotted in this fig.1 until the discontinuous increase from their minimal points .",
    "the `` second half '' of the oscillation in the eigenvalues as a function of @xmath0 is not contained in this spectrum of the @xmath1 poles of the giant cusp . to understand the rest of the spectrum we need to consider perturbation of the giant cusp by additional poles .",
    "the eigenfunctions can be found using the knowledge of the eigenvectors of these matrices .",
    "let us denote the eigenvectors of @xmath91 and @xmath79 as @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "the perturbed solution is explicitly given as ( taken for @xmath94 ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is @xmath97 so knowing the eigenvectors @xmath92 and @xmath93 we can estimate the eigenvectors @xmath62 of ( [ fell ] ) : @xmath98 or @xmath99 where we display separately the @xmath65 expansion and the @xmath64 expansion . for the case",
    "@xmath100 , the eigenvalue is zero , and a uniform translation of the poles in any amount @xmath70 results in a goldstone mode .",
    "this is characterized by an eigenvector @xmath101 for all @xmath102 . the eigenvectors @xmath103 ( fig.5,6)computed this way",
    "are identical to numerical precision with those shown in figs.2,3 , and observe the agreement .      in this subsection",
    "we identify the rest of the modes that were not found in the previous subsection . to this aim",
    "we study the response of the tfh solution to the introduction of additional poles .",

    "we can thus decompose any function in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath138 and @xmath103 .",
    "we discussed the stability of flame fronts in channel geometry using the representation of the solutions in terms of singularities in the complex plane . in this language the stationary solution , which is a giant cusp in configuration space , is represented by @xmath1 poles which are organized on a line parallel to the imaginary axis .",
    "we showed that the stability problem can be understood in terms of two types of perturbations .",

    "the reaction of the latter poles is again separated into odd and even functions as can be seen from eqs.([hil5 ] ) , ( [ hil6 ] ) .",
