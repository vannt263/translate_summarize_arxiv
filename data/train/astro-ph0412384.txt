    "absorption lines due to many different chemical transitions are produced in quasar spectra , due to intervening absorption systems .",
    "these systems are sampled by quasar lines of sight through galaxies and through intergalactic gas clouds .",
    "the absorption line spectra provide an opportunity to sample many different types of structures within and around galaxies .",
    "many of the structures that are sampled , particularly at high redshift , emit very little , if any , light .",
    "nonetheless , quasar absorption lines provide a way to study detailed properties of both visible and invisible absorbing structures .",
    "the kinematics , chemical composition and ionization states of absorption systems reveal multi - phase media @xcite .    a detailed study of the properties of gaseous phases , with a range of densities from @xmath8   to @xmath9   samples environments from the diffuse halo gas bridging galaxies to intergalactic medium to the dense regions in galaxies where stars are forming .",
    "it is valuable to place a quasar absorption line of sight in the context of the morphology of the galaxy through which it passes .",
    "however , the essence of quasar absorption line studies is to focus on the properties of the absorbing gas .",
    "this is because many of the types of environments we are studying through the absorption lines will not be detected through emission , particularly at high redshift .",
    "ultimately , large numbers lines of sight through galaxies , protogalaxies , galactic environments , and intergalactic regions from redshifts @xmath10 to @xmath11 will provide detailed evolutionary information about physical conditions .",
    "historically , absorption systems have been classified as `` strong '' or `` weak '' , divided by an rest frame equivalent width cutoff at @xmath12   .",
    "although this division was due primarily to the sensitivity of the previous generation of quasar absorption line surveys @xcite , it does apparently have some physical significance , at least roughly .",
    "strong absorbers are nearly always found within an impact parameter of @xmath13  kpc of a luminous galaxy ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the schechter luminosity ) @xcite . strong absorbers at redshifts @xmath16 to @xmath17 are therefore likely candidates for predecessors of present  day giant spiral and elliptical galaxies .    in contrast , weak absorbers ( those with @xmath18   ) do not usually have a luminous galaxy within a @xmath7  kpc impact parameter ( @xcite and references therein ) . despite this , many of these weak absorbers have a relatively high metallicity @xcite , so they can be used to trace metal production in intergalactic space and/or in dwarf and low  surface  brightness galaxies . therefore , they are of great significance in the search for elusive types of star  forming environments .",
    "this paper presents the derived properties of the multiple phases of gas in six absorption systems at @xmath19 along the lines of sight toward three quasars .",
    "three of these six systems are strong absorbers and the other three are weak absorbers .",
    "these six systems at part of a larger study of @xmath20 absorbers toward seven quasars for which high resolution spectra were available both in the ultraviolet and optical .",
    "this facilitates coverage of many different chemical transitions for systems at @xmath21 , the redshift range which is the focus of our study .",
    "our previous papers apply the same modeling techniques and solve for the physical properties of the multiple phases of gas in @xmath22 other absorption line systems @xcite .",
    "as would be expected , there are a variety of absorption properties even among strong or weak absorption systems .",
    "this indicates a range of physical conditions along different lines of sight .",
    "this is in part due to differences between different morphological types of galaxies , but it is also largely due to stochastic variations from place to place within galaxies and to evolutionary differences between different regions . because of the variety , it is illuminating to further classify systems according to their absorption properties in order to understand the common processes that may be involved .",
    "it is appropriate to focus on absorption properties rather than the morphology of the host galaxy for several reasons : 1 ) sometimes galaxy morphology information is unavailable , especially at high redshift ; 2 ) much is to be learned by studying gas in the universe that is not directly related to luminous galaxies , particularly gas in dwarf galaxies or protogalaxies ; 3 ) the properties of the gas are crucial for an understanding of processes ( e.g. , star formation , supershells , superbubbles ) that occur globally in many different types of galaxies and environments .",
    "@xcite developed a classification system for absorbers , based on a multi  variate analysis using equivalent widths of , , , and , and the kinematic spread of a high resolution profile as defining properties .",
    "the classes of absorbers discussed in their paper were `` classic '' , `` deficient '' , `` single / weak '' , `` double '' , and \" damped /rich .",
    "classic absorbers have strong absorption , with profiles consistent with disk / halo kinematics ( a dominant component and `` satellite '' clouds ) , and equally strong absorption .",
    "it has been suggested that much of the absorption is due to a diffuse phase that is analogous to the galactic corona @xcite .",
    "the deficient absorbers have absorption that is weak compared to and they seem to have red galaxy hosts @xcite , perhaps suggesting that a corona is absent in these cases .",
    "single / weak absorbers have weak absorption in all transitions , including with @xmath23 and usually with @xmath24   .",
    "double absorbers have , , , and with double the equivalent width of classic absorbers , such as would be expected from lines of sight through galaxy pairs @xcite .",
    "finally , damped /rich",
    "absorbers have and that is double that of the classics , but that is similar to the classics .",
    "these five classes do not connect directly to particular morphological classes of galaxies , although there may in some cases be correlations .",
    "in some cases they do seem to connect to processes and types of structures , e.g. the absence of a corona may lead to a deficient absorber , a pair of galaxies to a double absorber , and a high density environment near a star forming region to a damped /rich absorber .",
    "the goal of this work is to learn more about the specific processes involved in producing the various absorption signature , in order to ultimately draw more general conclusions about evolution .    among the six absorbers modeled in this paper ,",
    "there are @xmath25 single / weak absorbers , @xmath26 classic absorbers , and @xmath27 deficient absorbers .",
    "the @xmath28 system toward pg  @xmath1 is a single  cloud , weak absorber , and its metallicity and multi  phase properties will be compared to the three single  cloud , weak absorbers toward pg  @xmath29 for which the metallicity is near solar and a separate phase is clearly present .",
    "the @xmath30 system toward pg  @xmath1 is also classified as single  weak by the multi  variate analysis of @xcite , but it has several blended components in and is similar to the @xmath31 system toward pg  @xmath29 that @xcite hypothesized to be a pair of dwarf galaxies or a superwind .",
    "the three classic absorbers presented in this paper ( the @xmath32 system toward pg  @xmath1 and the @xmath33 and @xmath34 systems toward pg  @xmath2 ) have kinematically similar , a dominant component with `` satellite absorption '' reminiscent of milky way high velocity clouds .",
    "the latter two systems have galaxy candidates at impact parameters of @xmath35 and @xmath36  kpc , and the former is known to be a spiral @xcite . in our discussion of modeling results for these three `` classic '' systems we will focus on the distribution of in these absorbers , relative to the low ionization gas , considering its relevance for understanding coronae and high velocity clouds . finally , the @xmath37 absorber toward pg  @xmath3 is an example of a deficient absorber .",
    "it does have a host galaxy candidate , but at a surprisingly large impact parameter of @xmath38  kpc @xcite .",
    "the discussion in this papers will focus on the issues relevant to these systems , with comparison to other similar systems modeled previously .",
    "we briefly describe the spectra we use in   [ sec : spectra ] and host galaxy images in   [ sec : galaxy ] . a summary of our modeling technique is presented in   [ sec : model ] . in   [ sec : results ] we constrain physical parameters , outline the modeling results , and give physical interpretations for each of the six systems .",
    "we have included the spectroscopic observations toward three quasars ( pg  @xmath1 , pg  @xmath2 , and pg  @xmath3 ) .",
    "a combination of optical and ultraviolet spectra were used to study the six absorption systems detected along these lines of sight .",

    "the photon escape fraction from star ",
    "forming galaxies is @xmath59 at @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "a solar abundance pattern was initially assumed , with adjustment made later , if necessary .",
    "for each set of trial metallicity and ionization parameter , a `` model '' spectrum is produced for each transition and is then convolved with an instrumental spread function to generate a synthetic spectrum .",
    "this synthetic spectrum is then superimposed on the observed spectrum for comparison .    in many cases ,",
    "the clouds can account for only a small fraction of the absorption seen in the high  ionization transitions , such as , , and .",
    "thus , an additional diffuse phase is required to give rise to these transitions .",
    "a voigt profile fit to the c0.1emiv  @xmath61 doublet was usually performed to obtain redshift , column density , and doppler parameter for each needed high  ionization cloud . in cases",
    "where is saturated or contaminated by absorption from other transitions , either the si0.1emiv  @xmath62 doublet or the n0.1emv  @xmath63 doublet was used instead .",
    "based on the fitting results optimizing on the measured transition , cloudy @xcite was run again to constrain the metallicity and ionization parameter of the high  ionization phase .",
    "for the high  ionization phase , both photoionization and collisional ionization are considered as the possible ionizing mechanisms . for collisional ionization ,",
    "the temperature in the absorbing gas ( higher than the equilibrium temperature , e.g. due to shock heating ) is specified in addition to the ionization parameter in the cloudy code . by following a series of procedures similar to those described for the phase , we obtain synthetic spectra for the high  ionization phase .    by constraining metallicity , ionization parameter , and/or kinetic temperature ( for collisional ionization )",
    ", we try to obtain the minimum number of phases ( i.e. groups of gaseous clouds with similar densities and temperatures ) that are required to reproduce the observed spectrum for various transitions .",
    "alternative spectral shapes and abundance patterns are also explored , as mentioned earlier .",
    "modeling results , with ranges of acceptable parameters , are presented here for each of the six individual systems .",
    "figures  [ fig:0.8954 ] through [ fig:0.6600 ] show the examples of `` best models '' superimposed on the observed spectra .",
    "physical parameters of the plotted models are listed in tables  [ tab:0.8954][tab:0.6600 ] . for each system ,",
    "the presentation of results is followed by a discussion of the implications .        as shown in figure  [ fig:0.8954 ] , the system at @xmath28 is a single  cloud , weak system .",
    "in addition to the weak doublet , other metal transitions covered in the _ hst_/stis spectrum , such as , , and , also do not display a multi  component structure in their profiles .",
    "these transitions , all with a narrow , spiky profile shape , are aligned with each other in velocity space .",
    "however , the velocity centroid of the strongest absorption of these transitions is slightly offset from that of the cloud .",
    "a voigt profile fit to the mg0.1emii  @xmath64 doublet yields a single component at z=@xmath65 , with a column density of @xmath66 and doppler parameter of @xmath67  .",
    "a voigt profile fit to the c0.1emiv  @xmath61 doublet yields a single component at z=@xmath68 , a lower redshift than that of the cloud , equivalent to @xmath69   to the blue .",
    "this offset in velocity is unlikely to result from wavelength calibration , because it is not present in the systems at @xmath30 and @xmath32 toward the same quasar ( see figures  [ fig:0.5584 ] and  [ fig:0.5504 ] ) .",
    "however , the _ hst_/stis spectrum is fairly noisy , especially in the regions , , , and , which makes it possible that we should disregard the small velocity offset between the mg0.1emii  @xmath64 and c0.1emiv  @xmath61 doublets .",
    "therefore , both a one  phase scenario ( which assumes and are produced in the same gas despite the apparent velocity offset ) and a two  phase scenario ( which assumes two separate phases ) are explored .",
    "relevant parameters of both models are listed in table  [ tab:0.8954 ] .    in the one  phase scenario ,",
    "the cloud redshift is set to z=@xmath68 , where the strongest absorption in , , and occurs .",
    "this is also consistent with the minimum of the broad profile , which is centered on the other transitions covered in the _",
    "hst_/stis spectrum , but not with the strongest absorption .",
    "a profile fit to the c0.1emiv  @xmath61 doublet yields a column density of @xmath70 and doppler parameter of @xmath71  . a solar abundance pattern and a qso  only input spectrum",
    "are initially assumed , with the alternative input spectrum explored later .",
    "the ionization parameter of this cloud is stringently constrained to be @xmath72 ( within a @xmath73  dex of uncertainty ) , by the observed ratio of @xmath74/@xmath75 ( assuming they are produced in the same cloud despite the apparent velocity offset ) .",
    "a model with this ionization parameter also gives rise to the absorption consistent with the observed and  @xmath76 .",
    "it does not overproduce , which is not detected in the spectrum . in figure",
    "[ fig:0.8954 ] , it is shown that  @xmath77 is blended ( possibly with from a system at @xmath78 ) and the spectrum quality is low for  @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the model fit to these two transitions is not considered . at this ionization parameter",
    ", the metallicity is equally well constrained to be @xmath80 ( within @xmath73  dex of uncertainty ) , by the shape of the profile ( assuming that only this one cloud is responsible for the full absorption ) .",
    "the corresponding cloud size is @xmath81  kpc .",
    "an alternative is a two  phase model in which the gas that produces the majority of the absorption is separate from the gas that gives rise to the other metal transitions .",
    "the results of the voigt profile fits to and to ( separately ) are used to set redshifts and optimizing column densities for the two clouds .",
    "the cloud centered on ( the cloud hereafter ) is required to have an upper limit of @xmath82 so that it does not give rise to . for the cloud centered on ( the cloud hereafter ) , a lower limit of @xmath83 is placed on the ionization parameter , under the assumption that this cloud does not produce a significant amount of at this offset velocity .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath84 applies so that is not overproduced .",
    "the cloud also dominates the production of and its metallicity is determined to be @xmath80 .",
    "a higher metallicity can not fit the blue wing of while a significantly lower metallicity would cause the cloud to be jeans unstable .",
    "the ionization parameter and metallicity of the cloud in this two  phase model do not differ significantly from what is derived for the one  phase model .",
    "however , if the and clouds in this two  phase model are not assumed to have the same metallicity , then it is plausible for the cloud to have a much higher ( e.g. even super  solar ) metallicity .",
    "the alternative input spectrum , with the inclusion of stellar contribution from galaxies in addition to the radiation from background quasars @xcite , is explored for both models .",
    "the ionization parameter of the cloud in both cases would need to be increased by @xmath85  dex so as not to overproduce low  ionization transitions , in particular .",
    "the need for an increase of ionization parameter results from the sharp decrease in the number of photons between @xmath26@xmath86  ryd in the stellar spectrum as compared to the qso  only contribution .",
    "given that the ionization energy from to is @xmath87  ev , it follows that less would be produced from a lower  ionization state .",
    "in other words , a larger fraction of metals will be in a lower  ionization state .",
    "therefore , in order not to overproduce the low  ionization transitions , a higher ionization parameter ( @xmath88 ) would be required . for the cloud in the two  phase model , the change resulting from the background radiation",
    "is negligible due to the weak absorption .",
    "weak absorbers ( systems with @xmath89   ) comprise at least two thirds of all absorbers . among the weak absorber population ,",
    "about two thirds have only a single , narrow cloud . the single  cloud",
    ", weak systems usually have a more highly ionized , diffuse component producing absorption at the same velocity of the low  ionization cloud .",
    "the system at @xmath28 is a single  cloud , weak absorber .",
    "it has such weak absorption ( @xmath90   ) that it is among the weakest detected @xcite .",
    "this system is also unusual in that the absorption appears to be slightly offset in velocity from the other detected transitions , such as and .",
    "both one  phase and two  phase models could be compatible depending on whether this apparent offset is considered significant .    a study of 15 single  cloud , weak absorbers at @xmath91 in @xcite found that at least half of them contain two or more ionization phases of gas ( and in the others the constraint was not available ) .",
    "in these multi  phase absorbers , the high  ionization phase which produces the absorption also contributes substantially to the equivalent width .",
    "this is consistent with what we found for our two  phase scenario , in which the low ",
    "ionization gas only accounts for , but not significantly for any other transitions .",
    "in addition , both the results from @xcite , based on low  resolution _",
    "hst_/fos spectra ( @xmath92 ) , and a more recent study by @xcite of the three single  cloud , weak absorbers toward pg  @xmath29 using high  resolution _ hst_/stis spectra , found that many single ",
    "cloud , weak absorbers have near  solar or even super  solar metallicity .",
    "these systems apparently probe metal  enriched pockets and hence potentially trace enriched regions in the intergalactic medium or in dwarf galaxies . for our two  phase model , though the high  ionization cloud is required to have a relatively low metallicity ( @xmath93 solar ) , the metallicity of the cloud is largely unconstrained .",
    "it is possible that this system is of quite low metallicity compared to most single ",
    "cloud , weak absorbers .",
    "however , it is also possible that the cloud in the two  phase model is not associated with the high  ionization gas , but instead produced in a more metal  rich region .",
    "an alternative scenario for the @xmath28 system is a one  phase model .",
    "this single phase gives rise to the more highly ionized transitions such as and , as well as the observed , extremely weak absorption .",
    "both the ionization parameter ( @xmath94 ) and the size ( @xmath81  kpc ) of this phase resemble those derived for the high  ionization phase in the two  phase model .",
    "this indicates that we might actually be seeing the contributed by a diffuse , high  ionization phase only , while any denser phase is not penetrated along this line of sight .",
    "a survey of the warm  hot intergalactic gas in at @xmath95 sampled a group of absorbers with @xmath96 at higher redshifts . in these sub  lyman limit systems",
    "( llss ) , a photoionized phase with the temperature range @xmath97 was inferred to give rise to , , , and other lower  ionization transitions , in addition to the collisional ionized gas @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of this photoionized phase are similar to what we derived for the cloud in either the one  phase or two  phase model for the @xmath28 system .",
    "this could suggest that the @xmath28 system is related to such absorbers that were common at high redshift .",
    "the low  ionization absorption that is detected in our one or two  phase models might be suppressed at higher redshift due to the increased ionizing photon density .    on the other hand , in the local universe ,",
    "a study of the relationship between a absorber ( at @xmath98 ) and a nearby dwarf post ",
    "starburst galaxy in the @xmath26c  @xmath99 sightline was made by @xcite .",
    "the absorber was found similar to the three weak systems toward pg  @xmath29 modeled in @xcite , with an column density of @xmath100 , but with a somewhat lower metallicity of @xmath101 solar @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the observed absorption system is produced in the gas that is driven out by the supernovae explosion in the nearby dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the absorption in the @xmath98 system toward @xmath26c  @xmath99 is extremely weak ( @xmath102  m as measured by ghrs ) even when compared to that in the @xmath28 system .",
    "but with the decrease of the background radiation from @xmath103 to @xmath104 taken into account , a system with stronger and weaker absorption would be expected at @xmath105 . in this sense",
    ", the @xmath98 system could be a @xmath105 analog to the @xmath28 system .",
    "notably , the @xmath98 system also has an unusual offset between some of the different transitions . since at redshift @xmath28 , dwarf galaxies are too faint to be observed , we can not rule out the possibility that they are responsible for the absorption seen in some sub  llss .",
    "in fact , the low metallicity of the phase in the @xmath28 system ( @xmath93 solar ) is consistent with the interpretation that it originated in the ejecta from a dwarf galaxy .",
    "that is , either the dwarf galaxy itself creates the wind with overall low metallicity or the wind has swept up a large amount of the metal  poor gas @xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath28 system toward pg  @xmath1 lead to the question of whether there are two different types of single  cloud , weak absorbers .",
    "the first class would have close to solar metallicity in both the low and high  ionization phases , e.g. like the @xmath106 and @xmath107 absorbers toward pg  @xmath29 @xcite , and could perhaps arise through `` in  situ '' star formation in intergalactic regions .",
    "the second class would have lower metallicity and could be related to dwarf galaxies or dwarf galaxy winds , e.g. like the @xmath98 absorber toward @xmath26c  @xmath99 .",
    "it remains uncertain in which of these possible classes the @xmath28 absorber belongs .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:0.5584 ] , the system at z=0.5584 is a multi  cloud , weak absorber . the blended absorption spreads between v  @xmath108 and @xmath109  .",
    "however , neither nor has detected absorption to a @xmath110 rest ",
    "frame equivalent width limit of @xmath111   @xcite over this velocity range .",
    "the stis spectrum covers , 0.1emiii ,  @xmath112 , and , with only having detected absorption .",
    "the absorption covers a similar velocity range as .",
    "therefore , in principle , this system could be a single  phase absorber with and produced in the same phase of gas .",
    "a voigt profile fit to the doublet yielded four clouds at v@xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116  .",
    "table  [ tab:0.5584 ] lists their redshifts , column densities , and doppler parameters .",
    "initially , the radiation from background quasars is assumed to be the only ionizing source . with the assumption that the clouds are optically thin and all have the same ionization parameter , the absence of detected places a lower limit of @xmath117 .",
    "if arises in the same phase as the ( the one  phase scenario ) , then the ionization parameter can be stringently constrained by the ratio of @xmath75/@xmath74 for each cloud .",
    "for this case , the clouds at v@xmath113 and @xmath114   would have an ionization parameter of @xmath118 , with a @xmath73  dex uncertainty .",
    "the clouds at v@xmath119 and @xmath116   are constrained to have @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "if , instead , and arise in two different phases ( the two  phase model ) , then only a lower limit can be placed on the ionization parameter of the clouds , by the absence of detection . here , we favor the one  phase scenario , guided by our general principle of minimizing the number of phases .",
    "the ionization parameter ranges derived above are based on the assumption that the system is optically thin .",
    "this places a lower limit of @xmath122 on the system s metallicity .",
    "if , on the other hand , the system is optically thick , then the ratio @xmath75/@xmath74 would depend on both metallicity and ionization parameter . due to lack of the spectral coverage of any of the lyman series lines , the metallicity can not be constrained for the system . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on a scenario in which the system is optically thin .",
    "cloud sizes range from @xmath27@xmath123  kpc in a one  phase @xmath124 model , though they could be smaller for larger metallicities .",
    "an alternative input spectrum , with the inclusion of radiation from star  forming galaxies , was also explored .",
    "for the one  phase scenario , @xmath75/@xmath74 is slightly lower for the same ionization parameters , due to the softer stellar spectrum between @xmath26@xmath86  ryd .",
    "this results in an increase in ionization parameter by @xmath125  dex .",
    "the kinematics of multiple  cloud , weak systems can be cast into two distinct sub  categories .",
    "the systems in the first category , `` kinematically spread '' , have one or more dominant cloud(s ) and several weaker ones spread over a wider range ( for example , the @xmath34 system toward pg  @xmath2 which we will discuss in   [ sec : z0.8545 ] ) .",
    "the systems in the second category , known as `` kinematically compact '' , are characterized by multiple weak clouds ( with comparable equivalent widths ) blended together and spread over less than @xmath81   in velocity space ( for example , the @xmath126 system toward pg  @xmath29 in @xcite ) .",

    "specifically , the `` kinematically spread '' systems are found to resemble classic , strong absorbers in their physical properties and thought to arise in giant , luminous galaxies .",
    "perhaps the weakness of the absorption is a result of the line of sight passing through a relatively sparse region of a galaxy , at a large impact parameter , or of a relatively gas  free galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that the `` kinematically compact '' systems could be associated with dwarf galaxies instead .",
    "the system at @xmath30 toward pg  @xmath127 is a typical example of the `` kinematically compact '' , multiple  cloud , weak absorbers .",
    "we find that a one  phase model is consistent with the absorption seen from this system , in which both and are produced in the same gas . as discussed earlier",
    ", this interpretation is the most straightforward derivation from the observed absorption profiles . due to the extremely limited number of the transitions covered in the spectrum",
    ", there could be additional phases that we are unable to diagnose .",
    "another example of such `` kinematically compact '' , multiple  cloud , weak absorbers is the @xmath126 system toward pg  @xmath29 , studied by @xcite .",

    "in particular , the @xmath30 system could be produced in the line of sight that passes through a dwarf galaxy since a nearby luminous counterpart has not yet been found @xcite . in a superwind model",
    ", this system would be an example of passing through high  density concentrations on only one side of the wind , while the @xmath126 subsystems imply passage through two sides .",

    "furthermore , the diffuse phase in the @xmath130 system requires a higher metallicity than the phase @xcite .",
    "if such an offset , more metal  rich phase was to exist also in the @xmath30 system , then it would be a statistically significant increase in our sample of multiple  cloud , weak absorbers .",

    "for example , absorption could instead either originate in an phase ( as in the @xmath133 system toward pg  @xmath132 @xcite ) or in an additional intermediate phase ( for example as in the collisionally ionized phase in @xmath130 system toward pg  @xmath132 @xcite ) .",
    "lacking the spectral coverage of , , and , which usually place additional limits on kinematics , ionization state , and ionizing mechanism of individual clouds , it is hard to tell whether the phase is composed of multiple narrow structures or a single broad component .",

    "again , we would be in a better position to constrain the phase if the spectral coverage for was available .        as shown in figure  [ fig:0.5504 ] , the system at @xmath32 is a strong absorber , with , , and  3970 detected in the keck spectrum as well",

    "the most interesting and striking feature of the low  ionization gas in the @xmath34 system is probably the three pairs of lines seen at @xmath238 and @xmath239  , @xmath240 and @xmath241  , and @xmath242 and @xmath243  , in the absorption . these paired clouds , with @xmath244v@xmath245 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247  , respectively ,",

    "although not as obvious , the other two pairs could have similar structures within the uncertainties of our modeling of the high  ionization phase .",
    "high  ionization absorption could arise in the hotter , more diffuse medium that exists in the interior of the shell which gives rise to the paired absorption lines .",
    "the kinematic structure of most strong systems is consistent with a rotating disk in combination with radial infall from the halo @xcite .",

    "the absorption , with both narrow components and a broader , smooth structure in its profiles , is centered on the clouds .",
    "the broad component , with a doppler parameter of @xmath253  , could be comparable to the high  ionization phase in system b of the double system at @xmath254 toward pg  @xmath175 .",
