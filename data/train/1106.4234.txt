    "as almost all measurements on electromagnetic waves are measurements of intensity or phase ; there has been an abiding interest in a phase operator for light .",
    "having identified the number operator as the quantity proportional to intensity , dirac @xcite decomposed the annihilation operator for the harmonic oscillator as @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the phase operator and @xmath2 the number operator of the oscillator .",
    "the number operator was to be the quantum equivalent of the classical action and satisfy canonical commutation relations with the phase , @xmath3 = i$ ] .",
    "as he pointed out , this phase operator is not well defined as there is a lower bound on the eigenvalues of the number operator .",
    "in addition , the phase is periodic and defined modulo @xmath4 .",
    "subsequent workers @xcite all had the same problems of either lack of unitarity of the exponential operator or failure to obtain the canonical commutation relations for the number operator with the phase operator .",
    "an excellent review of the above ideas as well as those to be described below was given by lynch @xcite .",
    "+ pegg and barnett @xcite suggested the most popular way round these difficulties . the idea is to truncate the oscillator states to a finite number say @xmath5 .",
    "the operators in the resulting finite dimensional hilbert space are well behaved , this is extremely useful as a practical tool .",
    "however , questions have been raised @xcite of whether such a weak convergence to the limiting infinite dimensional operator gives the same results as the calculations directly using infinite dimensional operators . in view of these difficulties , noh , fougeres and",
    "mandel @xcite even suggested that a unique phase operator should not be sought .",
    "they suggest that we should only use an operational definition of phase based on experiment performed .",
    "+ with the recent development of quantum tomographic methods to study entanglement and deduce the wigner distribution , the phase or more accurately the phase difference has again become very topical @xcite .",
    "there has been many subsequent efforts to define a phase operator both for photons and for the closely related problem of the harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "many of these , especially the work by ban , luis and hradil , use products of two boson operators which are especially well suited to study parametric processes and higher order interference but are also used to cover the case of two orthogonal light polarization modes . these two boson representations are best suited to treat problems where the total number of photons is constant , as the two boson representations used are isomorphic to the angular momentum group .",
    "however as pointed out by bjork et .",
    ", @xcite these are not well defined in the vacuum state and indeed require a separate definition of the two mode vacuum state , which is annihilated by all elements of the schwinger two boson algebra .",
    "further , the addition of one more photon which can take place spontaneously or by stimulated emission , with very different consequences for the phase of the state is not naturally incorporated in the theory .",
    "there is another representation of the electromagnetic field , with the photon helicity as an internal quantum number , which was advocated by bialynicki - birula @xcite and independently by sipe @xcite , this suggestion made in the context of the photon wave function was subsequently shown to yield many other properties of the electromagnetic field in a fashion such that the passage from the classical theory to the quantum electrodynamics is particularly transperant , @xcite .",
    "our representation of the field in this paper is also over @xmath6 , rather than the usual product state formalism .",
    "the hilbert space we consider is a tensor product of a two internal dimensional space of polarization and the fock space of a single polarization mode .",
    "this agrees with the representations found by wigner , @xcite for massless relativistic particles .",
    "bargmann and wigner showed the appropriate relativistic representation for photons is two dimensional , this was elaborated later @xcite to show that it is indeed the natural representation to take into account all polarization phenomena . as the detailed calculations of kim et .",
    "show the operators for the commonly used devices like polarizers , phase plates are particularly simple in this representation being constant matrices .",
    "the action of such operators is similar on states with the same polarization but different number of photons .    as the riemann - silberstein vector @xmath7 as the photon wavefunction advocated by bialynicki - birula and sipe yields a representation for photons in both position and momentum space ,",
    "this method can be also used to study nonlocal correlations of the epr type , which are not easily defined in the usual product space representations .",
    "also it is known that the the cartesian components of the light polarization need to commute to give a definition consistent with maxwell s equations @xcite .",
    "sperling and vogel @xcite recently pointed out that removal of a right circularly polarized photon is the same as the addition of a left circularly polarized photon .",
    "they then suggest treating the left circularly polarized photons as antiparticles of the right circularly polarized photons and used this to construct a unitary susskind glogower operator @xmath8 .",
    "the difficulty with this theory is that there is a difference in angular momentum between the vacuum for left circularly polarized photons and that for right circularly polarized photons .",
    "we suggest a modification of the sperling - vogel procedure , based on two requirements .",
    "first , the quantum phase being an angle , _ the corresponding momentum must be an action variable_. the number operator acting on a fock state then measures the number of action quanta in the state .",
    "no experiment directly measures the action .",
    "however , the number of action quanta is equal to the number of azimuthal angular momenta in that state , which is measurable ; so we have a suitable proxy .",
    "the essence of our suggestion is that action and phase form a conjugate pair while energy and time form another conjugate pair and treating them as freely exchangeable may be part of the reason for the earlier difficulties .",
    "second , by passage through a phase plate , it is possible to transform a state of definite momentum and polarization `` a mode '' , into one of the orthogonal polarization , `` an orthogonal mode '' , while preserving the phase or changing it trivially .",
    "_ so the hilbert space relevant to phase measurements is that spanned by both the polarization modes taken together .",
    "if the number of right circular polarized quanta present is denoted by @xmath9 then the number of left circular quanta present is obviously @xmath10 or vice versa .",
    "this method of labelling of the helicity eigenstates is consistent with the requirement that if the right circularly polarized photons have positive values of azimuthal polarization and positive action , then the left circularly polarized photons have negative values of azimuthal angular momentum and consequently negative values of action .",
    "our method of labelling permits a natural extension to cover the negative integers required to attain unitarity .",
    "newton @xcite , suggested the use of such a two dimensional representation , but in terms of energy eigenstates , consequently he had to suppress the negative energy states which were only a mathematical intermediate step in his model .",
    "the angular momentum of light both orbital and spin has been measured and shown to add algebraically @xcite .    in the next two sections , the hilbert space and the susskind glogower operator",
    "are defined and the operator is shown to be unitary , while the corresponding phase operator is hermitian .",
    "we then find the eigen states of the susskind glogower operator and show they are orthogonal but non - normalizable .",
    "all the previous results cited above can be recovered by restricting our space to states of a single polarization .",
    "while we outline our results using the two opposite circular polarizations , they hold in any polarization basis . finally , using the projectors on to the different polarizations we construct operators which change the number of photons in one polarization state while leaving the other unchanged .",
    "as this operator for photon removal ( addition ) commutes with the corresponding annihilation ( creation ) operator acting on the whole space , we can use these to construct any arbitrary photon state .",
    "the positive frequency components of a single momentum mode of the electromagnetic field are usually written as @xcite , @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the annihilation operator for right circularly polarized light , and @xmath13 is the annihilation operator for left circularly polarized light .",
    "these operators satisfy the commutation relations , @xmath14 = \\left[\\hat{a}_{-},{{\\hat{a}}^{\\dagger}}_{-}\\right]=1 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\left[\\hat{a}_{+},{\\hat{a}}_{-}\\right ] = \\left[\\hat{a}_{+},{{\\hat{a}}^{\\dagger}}_{-}\\right]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath15 is the helicity operator then @xmath16 as there are two states for a given momentum @xmath17 and these are orthogonal ( malus law ) the natural representation appears to be in terms of a two - dimensional _ internal _ space .",
    "@xmath18 = \\left[\\begin{array}{c }   |n_{+ } > \\\\ 0    \\end{array } \\right ] + \\left[\\begin{array}{c }   0 \\\\ |n_{- } >    \\end{array } \\right ] , \\label{state - space}\\ ] ] along with @xmath19 = + \\left[\\begin{array}{c } |n_{+ } > \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right],\\nonumber \\\\ \\hat{p}\\left[\\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\ |n_{- } >   \\end{array}\\right ] = -\\left[\\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\ |n_{- } >   \\end{array}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the operator @xmath20 to define operators which project into the circular polarization eigenstates .",

    "the commutation relations impose no further restrictions on @xmath23_. the series termination requirement yields the fact that @xmath23 must be an integer .",
    "however the set of all non - negative integers as well as the set of all non - positive integers both satisfy equation ( [ qnumbers ] ) .",
    "@xmath27 we now apply this result to our formulation ; the modified annihilation operator of system is written as @xmath28.\\ ] ] where @xmath29 acts on positive states and @xmath30 acts on negative states and are given by , @xmath31=0   , \\ ;   \\left[\\hat{a}_{-},\\hat{p}\\right]=0 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for positive helicity states @xmath32 is the annihilation operator and for negative helicity states @xmath33 is the annihilation operator and @xmath34 is an operator which serves as bridge between two subspaces of positive helicity states and negative helicity states .",
    "it causes the vacuum of positive helicity states to change into vacuum of negative helicity states and vice - versa .",
