    "recent years have seen a flurry of activity stemming from the recognition  @xcite that the unusual ground - state correlations of dipolar spin ice should support excitations that behave as magnetic charges .",
    "these magnetic charges , or deconfined monopoles , are formed through the fractionalization of a single spin - flip ( dipole ) excitation . by virtue of the underlying correlations of the dipolar spin ice `",
    "vacuum ' , the monopoles experience a coulomb force between them and are found to flow under the influence of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite several experimental works and theoretical analyses of previous experimental work  @xcite have since verified the existence of these monopole excitations .",
    "furthermore , lithographically patterned , artificial spin ice systems have been created@xcite and also shown to exhibit monopole defects.@xcite in particular , the slow relaxation that is observed in the ac magnetic susceptibility of spin ice  @xcite has recently been attributed to the freezing out of dynamics of deconfined magnetic monopoles .",
    "@xcite    here , we present detailed low temperature ac susceptibility measurements , @xmath4 , on single crystal ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "these measurements represent an important step in the study of monopole physics of dipolar spin ice for several reasons .",
    "( i ) ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 has received less attention , at least from thermodynamic measurements , than dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "ac susceptibility measurements thus far have been limited to temperature scans of @xmath5 in higher temperature and frequency regimes .",
    "@xcite ( ii ) our experiments represent the first low temperature ac susceptibility measurements performed on single crystal spin ice in zero static field along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "( iii ) in previous work  @xcite on dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , there has not been a clear accounting of the demagnetization correction , which turns out to be rather important for quantitatively determining the intrinsic time constant of the system as a function of temperature and matching to theoretical predictions.@xcite the demagnetization correction also has qualitative effects on the shape of the frequency spectra .",
    "( iv ) this work extends measurements to much lower frequencies than previous work on any variety of spin ice , therefore delving deep into the coulomb phase .",
    "it is our hope that it will provide an important benchmark by which to test theories of monopole physics in dipolar spin ice .    in the pyrochlore materials ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( hto ) and dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( dto ) , the magnetic ions ho@xmath6 and",
    "dy@xmath6 occupy a lattice of corner sharing tetrahedra .",
    "the crystal field acting on those ions creates a strong ising anisotropy , with the easy axis , known as the local [ 111 ] axis , pointing directly in or out of the tetrahedra . for ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions ,",
    "the spins are highly frustrated and possess a macroscopically degenerate set of ground states , consisting of two spins pointing into and two spins pointing out of each tetrahedron .",
    "@xcite this situation is directly analogous to the proton bonds in water ice , hence the name ` spin ice ' . in both spin and water ice ,",
    "the macroscopic degeneracy of ground states gives rise to an extensive residual entropy @xmath7,@xcite known as pauling s entropy.@xcite in hto and dto , the nearest neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "ferromagnetic interaction is a result of dipole - dipole interactions , thus these systems are often referred to as dipolar spin ice .  @xcite considering the antiferromagnetic n.n .",

    "dipolar interaction .",
    "the further neighbor dipolar interactions are very well screened in this system .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , they are found , theoretically , to select a unique ground state for the system and should , in principle , result in a sharp , first - order phase transition .",
    "@xcite however , no such transition has been found in experiment ,  @xcite possibly because of the difficulties of reaching equilibrium at temperatures well below 0.5 k.    the unusual disordered ice - like state of dipolar spin ice , with its two - in , two - out tetrahedra , can be thought of as a divergence - free @xmath13 vacuum , with fluctuating magnetic field lines .",
    "@xcite the simplest excitation out of this vacuum is the flipping of one spin .",
    "this single spin flip affects two neighboring tetrahedra resulting in one with 3-in , 1-out and the other with 1-in , 3-out .",
    "this removes the divergence - free character of the system and leads to two magnetic charges , or monopoles , of opposite sign , centered on those tetrahedra . in the simple nearest neighbor model of spin ice , these monopole excitations are , once created , free to roam about on the lattice without any energy cost . in dipolar spin ice , however , the longer range interactions give rise to a coulomb interaction , @xmath14 , between magnetic monopoles.@xcite    this has been associated recently  @xcite with the slow relaxation observed in the ac magnetic susceptibility of spin ice .",
    "@xcite at temperatures ranging from about 2 k to 6 k , where the monopole density is high but there are very few double defects ( 4-out or 4-in ) , dto ac susceptibility data from ref .",
    "is well parametrized by an arrhenius law with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy cost of a single monopole defect .",
    "as the temperature is lowered and the concentration of monopoles decreases , the relaxation becomes slower than predicted by eq .",
    "[ arrheniuslaw ] .",
    "a reasonably good fit of experimental data is obtained by performing monte carlo simulations of a gas of monopole charges on the diamond lattice in the grand canonical ensemble with a largely temperature independent chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite    despite this strong verification of the monopole hypothesis , there remains some discrepancy between theory and experiment at lower temperatures ( below @xmath18 k ) in that the experiments find slower relaxation than is predicted by theory.@xcite it is , thus , important to further explore the low temperature freezing of spin ice systems .",
    "ensuring an accurate correction of the demagnetization effect and taking measurements to lower frequencies , as performed here , will permit careful comparison of experimental results with the theory of monopole defects .",
    "in contrast to the predictions of theory , our results show a temperature activated regime where the dynamics are described well by a surprisingly simple arrhenius law with @xmath3 activation energy at low temperatures .",

    "susceptibility , @xmath5 , measurements were performed using a magnetometer based on a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , mounted on a dilution refrigerator . the second - order gradiometer sensing coils are contained in the bore of an excitation coil consisting of 375 turns of nbti wire wound on a phenolic form with which an applied ac magnetic field , not exceeding 20 moe , is generated .",
    "the gradiometer is coupled to the squid by means of a superconducting flux transformer .",

    "the sapphire rod is clamped into the copper base of the sample holder and this sample holder is in turn heat sunk to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "frequency scans were taken by controlling the cryostat at a given temperature in the range of 500 to 1300 mk , and sweeping the frequency in the range of 1 mhz to 500 hz .",

    "rapid freezing of the magnetic moments can be seen through the sharply dropping peak frequency , @xmath29 , of the absorption spectrum @xmath28 as the temperature is lowered .",
    "we see that by 500 mk , @xmath29 is already below our frequency window at less than 1 mhz . at higher temperatures approaching 1.3 k , the peak position is beginning to plateau at around 100 hz .",
    "the magnitude of the susceptibility monotonically increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "however , judging by the peak height of @xmath21 , the susceptibility appears to be leveling off at the lowest temperatures studied .    in order to make comparison of the spectra more amenable ,",

    "spin flips must therefore occur through either quantum tunneling ( a slow process ) or by passing through the excited crystal field energy levels ( a much faster process ) .",
    "relaxation in the high temperature regime can thus be described by an arrhenius law with an activation energy of @xmath64 k. as the temperature is lowered it becomes difficult to populate the excited crystal field states reducing the transition rate .    below @xmath59",

    "@xcite this mismatch of timescales in the dynamics as determined by different measurement techniques remains an open question in the study of spin ice.@xcite the answer may lie in the wavevectors that are accessed by these various measurements ; while neutron scattering accesses specific wavevectors , bulk susceptibility addresses @xmath70 and @xmath17sr is a local measurement , thus has contributions from all wavevectors.@xcite    interestingly , measurements of dto by orend _",

    "of course different spin ice materials have different parameters in their respective hamiltonians , which makes their quantitative behavior different .",
    "finally , comparison is further hindered by the complex dynamical behavior of spin ice and the various measurement schemes and parametrizations that can be used .",
    "one of the most obvious ways to parametrize the data is with the maximum of the absorption spectra at fixed temperature , or @xmath31 .",

    "we can draw from the physics of monopole excitations discussed in refs .   to suggest what relations between the different relaxation rates should be expected .",
    "first , the tunneling rates will be different in the two materials studied .",
    "tunneling rates for ising moments like those in spin ice are functions of several different parameters .",
    "the symmetry and strength of the crystal field , hence the energy of excited states above the ising doublet , play an important role , giving the energy barrier through which the moments must tunnel.@xcite components of the exchange and dipolar interactions transverse to the local ising direction result in mixing with the excited crystal field energy levels , permitting tunneling to occur.@xcite furthermore , nuclear hyperfine interaction strengths , very different between dy@xmath6 and ho@xmath6 , can play a role in assisting or blocking spin flips.@xcite to further complicate the system , we may anticipate that there will not be a single microscopic tunneling time , but a distribution .",
    "however , spin ice has so far been treated with a single spin flip rate @xmath74.@xcite in the regime where tunneling is dominant ( from temperatures in the quasi - plateau regime and below ) , increasing the spin flip rate would be equivalent to stretching the frequency axis .",

    "@xmath75 k and @xmath76 k giving @xmath77  k.@xcite in ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the dipolar interaction is essentially the same , whereas @xmath78 k , giving a much higher value of @xmath79 k.@xcite because of the higher @xmath19 in hto , it enters the freezing , 2-in-2-out regime , at higher temperatures than dto.@xcite    when one goes beyond the nnsi model into the dipolar spin ice model , the monopole defects begin to interact with a coulomb law , @xmath80 , as long as they occupy distant sites on the diamond lattice .",
    "thus a third parameter , the magnetic charge @xmath20 , starts to play an important role at lower temperatures as the monopole density is reduced and there is less screening of the magnetic charges .",

    "@xmath20 is not directly related to @xmath19 , but only the strength of the dipolar interaction @xmath85 .",

    "however , it is not clear that their data has been corrected for demagnetization .",
    "the two samples have different geometries and the different orientations will give rise to different magnitudes of susceptibility since the magnetic field will be differently aligned with the different basis spins .",

    "two different maxima may be determined from temperature scans of @xmath21 , which are labelled as @xmath95 and @xmath73 .",

    ". the discrepancy could be attributed to a difference between powder samples@xcite and the aligned single crystals measured here.,width=312 ]",
    "to conclude , we have performed a careful study of the frequency dependent spin freezing in a single crystal of the dipolar spin ice material at low temperatures .",
    "the results are qualitatively consistent with research by other groups on ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2,@xcite on the related materials dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite and ho@xmath1sn@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite and also with theoretical work that relates such dynamics to the motion of magnetic monopole excitations.@xcite the results presented here represent an exploration much deeper into the coulomb phase of spin ice , with much lower temperatures and frequencies of measurement than were employed for ac susceptibility measurements previously .",
    "one of the most striking aspects of our results is the observation of a seemingly temperature activated regime below 1  k where the dynamics are well fit by an arrhenius law , consistent with a @xmath3 activation energy .",
    "it has also been noted@xcite that an arrhenius law with an activation energy close to @xmath3 is consistent with the low temperature limit of measurements on dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite while very few points contribute to that conclusion for dto , it nonetheless supports our observation of such an effect in hto .",
    "a more thorough investigation of the low temperature behavior of dto with full demagnetization correction would be valuable to verify or disprove the existence of the simple law that we have observed .",
    "it is not clear what could give rise to such a simple temperature activated regime in dipolar spin ice , which seems at odds with the current theoretical treatment of magnetic monopoles in dipolar spin ice.@xcite such theory instead predicts ever increasing activation energies as monopole density and thus screening is reduced.@xcite furthermore , a one - parameter ( @xmath19 ) fit to this low temperature regime surprisingly suggests that the monopole charge @xmath20 might be an irrelevant parameter .",
    "there remains the possibility that the accessible temperature range is simply narrow enough that a more complex @xmath96 function only appears to follow a linear behavior .",
    "the arrhenius law holds well over almost 4 orders of magnitude in frequency , though applies only over a factor of 2 in temperature .",
    "our measurements have also illustrated the complex nature of the spectra . while qualitatively glassy relaxation is seen , the precise behavior of the susceptibility spectra is quite different from that of spin glasses.@xcite in particular , as the temperature is lowered , the high frequency tail is found to narrow appreciably where the low frequency tail broadens .",
    "clearly illustrated here is the extreme importance of the demagnetization correction for such materials and its impact on the shape of the absorption spectra , for example .",
    "when compared to experiments on dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , theory currently shows a persistent mismatch at lower temperatures , with the experiments showing longer relaxation times than would be expected theoretically.@xcite while those experiments have not taken into account the demagnetization effect , this will not help explain the discrepancy and should in fact make it worse as correcting for demagnetization will lower the peak frequencies .",
    "in order to resolve such discrepancies , it has been suggested@xcite that higher order terms , such as next nearest neighbor exchange , @xmath97 , may need to be added to the currently accepted hamiltonian of the dipolar spin ices .",
    "such interactions were already found to be quite important for matching theory to experiment in dto.@xcite it would also be useful to consider the possibility that the low temperature susceptibility of is affected by bound pairs of monopoles .",
    "such very slowly relaxing pairs of monopoles have recently been predicted to occur after thermally quenching spin ice.@xcite it is not clear , however , whether experimentally inaccessible cooling rates are required to form these pairs or whether they are practically unavoidable in the real systems .",
    "it is hoped that the very exciting theory of monopole excitations in spin ice can begin to explain some of the peculiar effects that are seen in these susceptibility measurements .",
    "equivalently , these results , having been performed with careful demagnetization correction on single crystal samples and to comparatively low frequencies and temperatures , should serve as an important benchmark for testing the theory of monopole physics in spin ice .",

    "not accounting for the demagnetization effect can even result in _ qualitatively _ different susceptibility spectra .",

    "this method utilizes a calibration of the sample which ensures proper scaling of the apparent susceptibility with sample geometry , thereby providing a very accurate correction of the demagnetization effect .",
    "the only disadvantage , besides increased measurement time , is that it entails the assumption that the true susceptibility of the samples @xmath5 is not sample geometry dependent and that only the apparent susceptibility @xmath100 changes .",
