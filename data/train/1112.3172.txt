    "central spin models are the generic theoretical description for several solid state nanostructures which are presently under intensive experimental and theoretical study in the context of quantum information processing .",
    "important examples include semiconductor @xcite and carbon nanotube @xcite quantum dots , phosphorus donors in silicon @xcite , nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond @xcite and molecular magnets @xcite .",
    "the typical hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 and describes the interaction of @xmath1 central spins @xmath2 with @xmath3 bath spins @xmath4 characterized by coupling parameters @xmath5 with an overall coupling strength @xmath6 . in semiconductor quantum dots , for example , the role of the central spins is played by the confined electron spins interacting with the nuclear spins of the host material via the hyperfine contact interaction . here",
    "the coupling constants @xmath5 are proportional to the square modulus of the respective electronic wave function at the sites of the nuclear spins and therefore clearly not equal to each other ( `` inhomogeneous '' ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 in the second term of ( [ h ] ) account for an exchange coupling between the different electron spins , where we assume @xmath8 in the following , and the third term describes a magnetic field applied to the electron spins . for reviews concerning the hyperfine interaction in semiconductor quantum dots the reader",
    "is referred to refs .",
    ".    an important ingredient to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) are the so - called flip - flop terms , @xmath9 which are off - diagonal in the basis with the field direction as the quantization axis",
    ". theoretical treatments of ( [ h ] ) so far have usually distinguished between ( i ) the case of a strong magnetic field , as compared to the overall coupling strength , @xmath10 , and ( ii ) the case of a weak magnetic field , @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , for the most intensively studied situation of a single central spin , @xmath12 , the flip - flop terms have in case ( i ) been treated as a perturbation with @xmath13 being a small parameter @xcite , whereas in the opposite case ( ii ) it is commonly accepted that non - perturbative methods are required .",
    "@xcite however , very recently it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , again for @xmath12 , that surprisingly there is a well - controlled perturbative treatment in @xmath14 , meaning that , for large enough systems , also the case of a _ weak _ magnetic field can be treated perturbatively .",
    "this approach was motivated by the statement that the `` smallness of the longitudinal spin decay is controlled by the parameter @xmath15 '' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath16 denotes the electron spin zeeman splitting .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to give a systematic and unbiased analysis of the scaling properties regarding the flip - flop contributions to the dynamics and hence the perturbative regimes .",
    "we want to investigate , in particular , the dependence on the bath size @xmath3 so that we can not make use of exact numerical diagonalization . for @xmath12 and if @xmath17 also for arbitrary values of @xmath1 , a natural alternative would be to choose an approach based on the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "this , however , leads to sets of algebraic equations which are extremely difficult to treat .",
    "therefore , we have to focus on the case of homogeneous couplings , @xmath18 ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) generally conserves the total spin @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for homogeneous couplings it in addition",
    "commutes with the square of the total bath spin @xmath22 , @xmath23=\\left[h , \\vec{i}\\,^2\\right]=0\\,.\\ ] ] in what follows , we restrict ourselves to the spin length @xmath24 .",
    "we calculate the central spin dynamics by decomposing the initial state @xmath25 into eigenstates @xmath26 of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , @xmath27 and applying the time evolution operator.@xcite we will focus on initial states with fixed @xmath28 quantum number @xmath29 so that only the expectation values of the @xmath30-components of the spin operators will show non - trivial dynamics .",
    "moreover , due to the homogeneity of the couplings , the dynamics of the different central spins can be read off from each other and we therefore concentrate on the time evolution @xmath31 .    a state which is a simple product of spin states with definite @xmath30-component is , for vanishing @xmath32 , an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) except for the flip - flop terms .",
    "thus , for such an initial state all dynamics is due to @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , in order to isolate the effect of the flip - flop terms we consider initial states of this type , @xmath34 so that @xmath35 note that for homogeneous couplings the order of the spin states within the two subsystems is of no importance",
    ".    since the @xmath36 dimensional bath hilbert space is spanned by the eigenstates of @xmath37 , every product state can be written in terms of these eigenstates :    @xmath38    here the quantum numbers @xmath39 describe a certain clebsch - gordan decomposition of the bath .",
    "because of ( [ symm ] ) , the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) does not couple states from different multiplets so that @xmath40 decomposes into a sum of dynamics on the multiplets given in ( [ inidec ] ) .",
    "these contributions are weighted by @xcite @xmath41 with @xmath42 . in order to compute the dynamics",
    ", one still needs to perform a diagonalization within the @xmath43 dimensional hilbert space of the central spins for any value of @xmath44 in ( [ inidec ] ) .",
    "this diagonalization as well as the sum according to ( [ inidec ] ) are performed numerically .    in",
    "the following we focus on a weak but finite exchange coupling @xmath45 if not stated otherwise .",
    "the precise value of @xmath32 is not of significance ; similar exchange couplings of the same order yield qualitatively the same results .",
    "however , below we will also briefly comment on the special case @xmath46 .",
    "the polarization of the central spin system or the bath respectively is defined by @xmath47 it is well - known that the bath polarization influences the central spin dynamics in a way very similar to a magnetic field @xcite . in the present paper , we will restrict our discussions to a very low bath polarization of @xmath48 , corresponding to @xmath49 .",
    "this is a particularly interesting special case because any effects of the polarization are excluded .",
    "however , the results to be presented below are clearly not generic with respect to other values of @xmath50 .",
    "in fig . [ fig : dyn ] we give examples of the dynamics for @xmath51 with the initial states of the central spin system , @xmath52 , given by @xmath53 . in all cases ,",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation is decaying to zero ( followed by a series of revivals on longer time scales not shown in the figures @xcite ) .",
    "the influence of the magnetic field on the flip - flop terms manifests itself in two effects so that there are two different `` perturbative measures '' . on the one hand ,",
    "the spin is fixed in its initial direction , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] given by @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the magnitude ( `` smallness '' ) of the spin decay , denoted by @xmath55 from now on , is decreasing with increasing magnetic field .",
    "let us further clearify to what extent quantifications of these two effects allow to judge about the applicability of perturbative treatments . as explained above , perturbative treatments of central spin problems typically consider a magnetic field and treat @xmath33 as a small perturbation .",
    "clearly , this approach is justified only if the influence of @xmath33 on the central spin dynamics is indeed sufficiently small . in other words ,",
    "a perturbative treatment becomes the more adequate the stronger @xmath33 is suppressed .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 can be calculated as @xmath56 which becomes independent of @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the measure is illustrated in the first panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] . on the other hand , the decoherence time , denoted by @xmath59 , as measured by the decay of the amplitude of the oscillation , increases with increasing field strength . in order to calculate the scaling of @xmath59",
    ", we fix some adequate `` threshold level '' @xmath60 and analyze after which time the amplitude falls under this value . the procedure is indicated in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] .",
    "note that the concrete value of the threshold level is of no importance .",
    "it only has to be chosen in a way that the amplitude of @xmath40 is larger than the threshold level before the onset of the decay .",
    "this procedure has been used already in ref .",
    "furthermore , a very similar approach has been chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] we see that for magnetic fields of identical strengths , the value of @xmath55 is much smaller for @xmath12 and a central spin polarization of @xmath61 than for @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , for large values of @xmath64 it is @xmath55 which adequately describes the influence of the magnetic field on the flip - flop terms and for small values it is @xmath59 . in between , both of the measures are of relevance . in the present paper",
    "we exclude this case and concentrate on the three cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] where in case only one scale is relevant .",
    "now we come to the central results of the present paper . in",
    "what follows , we investigate the scaling of the two measures @xmath55 and @xmath59 with the magnetic field strength for a fixed particle number and with the particle number for a fixed magnetic field . with respect to the scaling of @xmath55 we consider @xmath65 and for @xmath59 we focus on @xmath62",
    "as already mentioned above , due to ( [ symm ] ) and ( [ inidec ] ) , the dynamics @xmath40 decomposes into a sum of dynamics on different multiplets . in a first step , it is instructive to focus on @xmath12 and to consider only a single term of the sum .",
    "as to be demonstrated below , this leads to the scaling of the measure @xmath55 with the magnetic field on a fully analytical level .      as we are dealing with only a single central spin in this subsection , in what follows we drop the index in @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the quantum number of some multiplet in the sum @xmath67 .",
    "this corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath68 for fixed @xmath29 this corresponds to a @xmath69 matrix , which can be diagonalized easily .",
    "here it is convenient to respresent @xmath70 with respect to the eigenbasis of the first term , @xmath71 , resulting from the well - known formula for coupling a spin of arbitrary length to a spin of length @xmath72 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 this yields the matrix @xmath75 \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2 } { 4}-\\frac{b^2m^2}{x^2 } } & -\\frac{a'(i+1)}{2 } - \\frac{bm}{x}\\\\ \\end{pmatrix } , \\end{large}\\ ] ] where we introduced the shorthand notation @xmath76 .",
    "we denote the components of the @xmath70 eigenstates with respect to the basis @xmath77 by @xmath78 and the corresponding eigenvalues by @xmath79 . diagonalizing ( [ matrix ] ) ,",
    "we get    [ hieigst ] @xmath80    with    [ ab ] @xmath81    here we defined @xmath82 and @xmath83 considering the initial state @xmath84 , it then follows for the central spin dynamics : @xmath85\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we denote the measure @xmath55 corresponding to ( [ hi ] ) by @xmath86 .",
    "obviously , the quantities @xmath87 , introduced in ( [ eqdyn ] ) , are related to @xmath86 by @xmath88 inserting ( [ ab ] ) in the expression for @xmath89 given in ( [ eqdyn ] ) and performing some extensive algebra ( see appendix ) , we get @xmath90 and hence @xmath91 let us consider @xmath92 to be given in units of @xmath93 ( for simplicity we denote @xmath94 ) .",
    "then we have @xmath95 .",
    "as mentioned above , in our analysis we focus on initial states with nearly unpolarized baths .",
    "the measure @xmath55 is significant only for highly polarized central spin systems .",
    "hence , in the most important situation of @xmath96 it follows @xmath97 so that @xmath98 scales like @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath100 .",
    "this result is independent of the value of @xmath66 and , hence , we arrive at @xmath101      now we evaluate the full dynamics in an almost analytical fashion and derive the scalings of @xmath55 ( for @xmath65 ) and @xmath59 ( for @xmath62 ) . as to be demonstrated below , the number of central spins has no ( direct ) influence on the result . in figs .",
    "[ fig : mu_scale ] and [ fig : tau_scale ] we plot @xmath55 and @xmath59 against the magnetic field and the number of bath spins on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "we consider two different values of @xmath3 or @xmath92 respectively for each number of central spins .",
    "obviously , this changes the values of the measures , but not their scaling properties . for the @xmath92 field",
    "scaling we find a simple power law @xmath102 in all cases , which for @xmath12 reproduces the fully analytical result presented above . indeed , already this is much stronger than the @xmath103 scaling anticipated by the perturbative approaches presented so far .",
    "@xcite note that an _ increase _ of @xmath59 indicates a _ decrease _ of the influence of the flip - flop terms on the dynamics .",
    "the scaling with the number of baths spins turns out to be even more surprising . for @xmath55",
    "we find @xmath104 , whereas for @xmath59 the influence of @xmath33 scales down with @xmath105 .",
    "as mentioned above , for @xmath62 we always considered a weak but non - zero exchange coupling @xmath106 .",
    "the results are generic for @xmath107 .",
    "however , for a _ zero _ exchange coupling , @xmath46 , the @xmath59 scaling yields a slightly different result . here",
    "the exponent in the magnetic field scaling @xmath108 decreases from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "we have no explanation for the concrete value of @xmath111 .",
    "however , it is not suprising that @xmath112 does not become @xmath113 as in the case @xmath12 , where we naturally have @xmath46 .",
    "this would be the natural guess if for @xmath46 the hamiltonian would decompose in a sum of independent @xmath12 models . however , this is not the case as the @xmath1 central spins interact with a common bath . here",
    "the dynamics of the central spins result from the interaction with the spin bath and with each other through the spin bath .",
    "the case of separate baths has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    consequently , in any case the somewhat surprising approach to use @xmath14 as a the small parameter for a perturbative treatment , presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , turns out to even _",
    "underestimate _ the flip - flop suppressing character of the particle number .",
    "hence , with respect to the particularly interesting low field case the perturbative limit is not yet achieved .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the scaling of the influence of the flip - flop terms with the magnetic field and the number of bath spins in central spin models . in order to be able to treat comparatively large systems , we considered homogeneous couplings .",
    "the flip - flop contribution to the dynamics has been isolated by choosing simple product initial states .",
    "the effect of an applied magnetic field manifests itself in the magnitude of the spin decay and the decoherence time . for highly polarized central spin systems it is the magnitude of the spin decay which is the relevant scale ,",
    "whereas for a low central spin polarization it remains , to a large extent , unaffected and the decoherence time describes the influence of the magnetic field .",
    "we investigated the scaling of @xmath55 and @xmath59 for @xmath65 and @xmath62 in different parameter regimes .",
    "surprisingly , we found that @xmath55 decreases _ quadratically _ with the magnetic field and linearly with the number of bath spins .",
    "for @xmath12 we presented a fully analytical derivation . for @xmath114",
    "the decoherence time shows identical scaling properties with respect to the magnetic field , whereas if @xmath46 , the behavior slightly changes to @xmath115 . as a very interesting and unexpected result , it turns out that @xmath59 increases _ quadratically _ with the number of bath spins , corresponding to a quadratic decrease of the flip - flop contributions to the dynamics . summarizing , for @xmath116 our results suggest @xmath117 as the small parameter of a perturbation theory .",
    "this essentially goes along with the approach considered in refs .",
    ". however , for small values of @xmath64 we have @xmath118 this means that the perturbative treatments of central spin models presented so far strongly underestimate the influence of both , the magnetic field as well as the number of bath spins .",
    "it is therefore desirable to search for new approaches using the full suppression of the flip - flop terms .",
    "although all scaling properties are independent @xmath1 , central spin models with more than one central spins are particularly interesting with respect to such investigations , as here low polarizations of the central spin system can be achieved .",
    "this leads to a very strong decrease of the influence of the flip - flop terms with the number of bath spins and hence the possibility to treat extremely small magnetic fields .",
    "this work was supported by dfg via sfb631 .",
    "in what follows we present details on the derivation of ( [ expr ] ) . inserting the eigensystem ( [ hieigst ] ) of the hamiltonian ( [ hi ] ) in the expression for @xmath119 given in ( [ eqdyn ] ) we get          on the other hand , the expression ( [ expr ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath122 if we now equalize ( [ rewrit ] ) with ( [ expr2 ] ) and multiply by the denominators , we get for one side @xmath123 and for the other @xmath124 inserting ( [ y ] ) in the terms proportional to @xmath98 immediately shows that ( [ xx ] ) and ( [ xxx ] ) are identical , which yields ( [ expr ] ) .",
