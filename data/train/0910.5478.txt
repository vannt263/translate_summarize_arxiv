    "these deviations can be explained by partial antiferromagnetic indirect exchange between the localized spins as a consequence of electron - magnon and magnon - magnon interaction .",

    "the linewidths calculated by our method turn out to be too small,@xcite which can be explained by the absent electron - phonon interaction .",
