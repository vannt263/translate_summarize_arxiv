    "* for reviews ) .",
    "after the classification scheme of @xcite , they are often divided into two main groups according to their origins and observed properties : _ radio gischt _ and _ agn relic / radio phoenix_. radio gischt relics are thought to be produced by merger - driven shocks .",
    "they are characterized by elongated shape , radio spectrum steepening behind the hypothesized shock , power - law - like integrated radio spectrum , and high polarization fraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "they are found mainly in the periphery of merging clusters .",
    "giant radio relics such as the sausage relic in ciza j2242.8 + 5301 and the toothbrush relic in 1rxs j0603.3 are typical examples of radio gischt @xcite . on the other hand , agn relics are radio - emitting relativistic plasmas ejected from radio - loud agns , and they turn into _ radio ghosts _",
    "( undetectable in radio ) quickly due to fast electron cooling when their source agns are extinct @xcite .",
    "radio ghosts can be reborn later as radio phoenixes , if cooled electron plasmas are compressed and re - energized by structure - formation shocks @xcite .",
    "radio phoenixes have roundish shape and steep - curved integrated radio spectrum of aged electron populations , and they are found near their source galaxies in the cluster center region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the relics in a2443 and a1033 are radio phoenixes @xcite .    in the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) model for radio gisct relics ,",
    "relativistic electrons are accelerated or re - accelerated at cluster shocks that are driven by supersonic motions associated with mergers of sub - structures or infall of the warm - hot gas along filaments into the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the presence of agn relics and radio phoenixes implies that the icm may host clouds of aged relativistic electrons with @xmath7 .",
    "re - acceleration of those electrons by cluster shocks as the origin of radio relics has been explored by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the re - acceleration model for radio gischt relic",
    ", it is assumed that the shock propagates in the icm thermal plasma that contains an additional population of suprathermal electrons with dynamically insignificant nonthermal pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the role of those fossil electrons is to provide seed electrons to the dsa process . in the compression model for radio phoenix ,",
    "on the other hand , the fossil radio plasma does not mix with the background gas and has high buoyancy and high sound speed @xcite .",
    "so the radio plasma is compressed only adiabatically , when a shock wave sweeps through the radio bubble .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that the shock passage through such hot radio plasma results in a sheet - like radio source in the early stage , and then evolves into a filamentary or toroidal structure , which is consistent with the observed morphology of radio phoenixes @xcite .    according to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for large - scale structure formation , shocks are ubiquitous in the icm with the mean separation of @xmath8 mpc between shock surfaces and with the mean life time of @xmath9 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so it is natural to expect that actively merging clusters would contain at least several shocks and associated radio relics .",
    "however , the fraction of x - ray luminous merging clusters hosting radio relics is observed to be order of @xmath4 % @xcite . in order to reconcile such rarity of observed radio gischt relics with the frequency of shocks estimated by those structure formation simulations ,",
    "@xcite ( paper i ) proposed a scenario in which shocks in the icm may light up as radio relics only when they encounter clouds of fossil relativistic electrons left over from either radio jets from agns or previous episodes of shock / turbulence acceleration .    in the basic dsa model of steady planar shock with constant postshock magnetic field ,",
    "the electron distribution function at the shock location becomes a power - law of @xmath10 with slope @xmath11 , while the volume - integrated electron spectrum behind the shock becomes @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "then , the synchrotron spectrum at the shock becomes a power - law of @xmath13 with the _ shock index _",
    ", @xmath14 , while the volume - integrated radio spectrum becomes @xmath15 with the _ integrated index _",
    ", @xmath16 , above the break frequency @xmath17 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here , @xmath18 is the sonic mach number of the shock .",
    "the simple picture of dsa needs to be modified in real situations . in the re - acceleration model , for instance ,",
    "if the fossil electrons dominate over the electrons injected from icm plasma , the ensuing electron spectrum must depend on the shape of the fossil electron spectrum and may not be a single power - law .",
    "in addition , if the shock acceleration duration is less than @xmath19 myr , the integrated radio spectrum can not be a simple power - law , but instead it steepens gradually over the frequency range of @xmath20 ghz , since the synchrotron break frequency falls to @xmath21 ghz or so @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , even with a pure _ in situ _ injection model , both the electron spectrum and the ensuing radio spectrum could depart from simple power - law forms in the case of spherically expanding shocks with varying speeds and/or nonuniform magnetic field profiles . in paper",
    "i , we showed that the re - acceleration of fossil electrons at spherical shocks expanding through cluster outskirts could result in the curved integrated spectrum .    in some radio relics , the integrated radio spectra exhibit the steepening above @xmath0 ghz , but much stronger than predicted from simple radiative cooling of shock - accelerated electrons in the postshock region .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggested that the integrated spectrum of the relic in a2256 could be fitted by a broken power - law with @xmath22 between 0.35 ghz and 1.37 ghz and @xmath23 between 1.37 ghz and 10.45 ghz .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the integrated spectral index of the sausage relic increases from @xmath24 below @xmath25 ghz to @xmath26 above @xmath27 ghz , while that of the toothbrush relic increases from @xmath23 below @xmath25 ghz to @xmath28 above @xmath27 ghz .",
    "note that @xmath29 for the low frequency spectrum of the sausage and toothbrush relics is larger than the inferred shock index , @xmath30 , while @xmath31 for the high frequency part is also larger than @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the case of the sausage relic , the steepening of @xmath33 is much stronger than expected for aging postshock electrons .",
    "this demonstrates that the simple relation of @xmath16 should be applied only with caution in interpreting observed radio spectra .",
    "the picture of dsa just based on shock compression and radiative cooling should be too simple to be applied to real situations , which could be complicated by additional elements such as the presence of pre - exiting electron population and the variations of shock dynamics and magnetic field amplification .    in an attempt to reproduce the observed spectrum of the sausage relic ,",
    "paper i showed that the integrated spectrum estimated from the dsa simulations of spherical shocks expanding in the cluster outskirts with the ` acceleration ' age , @xmath34  myr , steepens only _ gradually _ over @xmath20 ghz .",
    "but the abrupt increase of @xmath35 above @xmath0 ghz detected in the sausage relic could not be explained , implying that additional physical processes would operate for electrons with @xmath36 . in this study",
    ", we propose a simple but natural re - acceleration scenario , in which the shock passes through a finite - size cloud of fossil electrons and runs ahead of the postshock volume of radio - emitting electrons . since",
    "the supply of seed electrons is stopped outside the cloud , the shock no longer efficiently accelerate electrons . then , the integrated radio spectrum of the relic steepens beyond radiative cooling alone , and the shock front and the radio relic do not coincide spatially with each other .",
    "another observational feature that supports the re - acceleration scenario is nearly the uniform surface brightness along thin elongated structures observed in some relics , such as the sausage relic and the toothbrush relic @xcite . using numerical simulations of merging cluster",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that a merger - driven bow shock would generate the surface brightness profile that peaks in the middle and decreases along the length of the relic away from the middle , if the electrons are injected / accelerated at the shock and occupy a portion of spherical shell .",
    "so their study implies that the pure _ in situ _ injection picture may not explain the uniform surface brightness profile .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite showed that the radio flux density profile with the observed width of @xmath37 kpc for the sausage relic can be fitted by a patch of cylindrical shell with radius @xmath38 mpc , which is defined by a length of @xmath0 mpc and an ` extension angle ' of @xmath39 .",
    "although rather arbitrary and peculiar , such a configuration could yield uniform radio flux density along the length of the radio relic . in paper",
    "i , we proposed that such a geometrical structure can be produced , if a spherical shock propagates into a long cylindrical volume of fossil electrons and the re - accelerated population of fossil electrons dominates over the injected electron population ( see also figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    ", we adopt the same geometrical structure for the radio - emitting volume in the calculation of the surface brightness profile , but assuming that the shock has existed and runs ahead of the volume .    in the next section ,",
    "the numerical simulations and the shock models , designed to reproduced the sausage relic , are described . in section 3 , our results",
    "are compared with the observations of the sausage relic .",
    "a brief summary is followed in section 4 .",
    "the numerical setup for dsa simulations , the basic features of dsa and synchrotron / inverse - compton ( ic ) cooling , and the properties of shocks and magnetic fields in the icm were explained in details in paper i. here only brief descriptions are given .",
    "the diffusion - convection equation for the relativistic electron population is solved in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spherical geometry : @xmath40 + p { \\partial \\over { \\partial y } } \\left ( { b\\over p^2 } g_e \\right ) , \\label{diffcon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the pitch - angle - averaged phase space distribution function of electrons and @xmath42 with the electron mass @xmath43 and the speed of light @xmath44 @xcite . the background flow velocity , @xmath45 , is obtained by solving the usual gasdynamic conservation equations in the test - particle limit where the nonthermal pressure is assumed to be negligible .    the spatial diffusion coefficient for relativistic electrons is assumed to have the following bohm - like form , @xmath46 then , the cutoff lorentz factor in the shock - accelerated electron spectrum is given by @xmath47 where the magnetic field strength is expressed in units of @xmath6 g , and @xmath48 is the ` effective ' magnetic field strength which accounts for both synchrotron and ic losses @xcite .",
    "hereafter , the subscripts `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' are used to indicate the preshock and postshock quantities , respectively . note that for electrons with @xmath49 , the diffusion length is @xmath50 cm and the diffusion time is @xmath51 s if @xmath52 .",
    "so in effect electrons are accelerated almost _ instantaneously _ to the cutoff energy at the shock front .    the radiative cooling coefficient , @xmath53 , is calculated from the cooling time scale as @xmath54 the cooling time scale for the radio - emitting electrons with @xmath55 is about @xmath56 yr for the magnetic field strength of a few @xmath6 g .      for the initial setup",
    ", we adopt a sedov blast wave propagating into a uniform static medium , which can be specified by two parameters , typically , the explosion energy and the background density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ", we instead choose the initial shock radius and speed as @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "as in paper i , the shock parameters are chosen to emulate the shock associated with the sausage relic ; the preshock temperature is set to be @xmath59 kev , corresponding to the preshock sound speed of @xmath60 @xcite . the background gas is assumed to be isothermal , since the shock typically travels only @xmath61 kpc , which is sufficiently small compared to the size of galaxy clusters , for the duration of our simulations @xmath62 myr .",
    "the density of the background gas in cluster outskirts is assumed to decrease as @xmath63 .",
    "this corresponds to the so - called beta model for isothamal icms , @xmath64^{-3\\beta/2}$ ] with @xmath65 , which is consistent with typical x - ray brightness profiles of observed clusters @xcite .",
    "since we neglect the _ in situ _ injection at the shock front ( see section 2.4 ) and we do not concern about the absolute radio flux level in this study ( see section 3 ) , @xmath66 needs not to be specified .",
    "although the synchrotron cooling and emission of relativistic electrons in radio relics are determined mainly by postshock magnetic fields , little has yet been constrained by observations .",
    "thus , we consider a rather simple model for postshock magnetic fields as in paper i. ( 1 ) the magnetic field strength across the shock transition is assumed to increase due to the compression of two perpendicular components , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the preshock and postshock magnetic field strengths , respectively , and @xmath70 is the density compression ratio across the shock . ( 2 ) for the downstream region ( @xmath71 ) , the magnetic field strength is assumed to scale with the gas pressure as @xmath72^{1/2 } , \\label{bd}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the gas pressure immediately behind the shock . in effect , the ratio of the magnetic to thermal pressure , that is , the plasma beta , is assumed to be constant downstream of the shock .      in paper i , we explored a scenario in which a shock in the icm lights up as a radio relic when it encounters a cloud that contains fossil relativistic electrons , as described in the introduction . in this study , we consider a slightly modified scenario in which a spherical shock passes across a fossil electron cloud with width @xmath74 kpc .",
    "then , the shock separates from and runs ahead of the downstream radio - emitting electrons after the crossing time , @xmath75 .",
    "we assume that the downstream volume with relativistic electrons has the same geometric structure as illustrated in figure 1 of @xcite , except that the shock is detached from and moves ahead the radio - emitting volume .",
    "in other words , the re - acceleration of seed electrons operates only during @xmath76 , that is , between the time of entry into and the time of exit out of the fossil electron cloud , and then , the downstream electrons merely cool radiatively up to @xmath77 , leading to the steepening of the integrated radio spectrum .",
    "hereafter , the ` age ' , @xmath78 , is defined as the time since the shock enters into the cloud .",
    "the fossil electrons are assumed to have a power - law spectrum with exponential cutoff , @xmath79 , \\label{fexp}\\ ] ] with @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the slope and the cutoff lorentz factor , respectively .",
    "again the normalization factor , @xmath82 , is arbitrary in our calculations .",
    "this could represent fossil electrons that have cooled down to @xmath83 from much higher energies for @xmath84 gyr .",
    "as described in paper i ( also in the introduction ) , one can think of several possible origins for such fossil electrons in the icm : ( 1 ) old remnants ( radio ghosts ) of radio jets from agns , ( 2 ) electron populations that were accelerated by previous shocks and have cooled down @xmath85 , and ( 3 ) electron populations that were accelerated by turbulence during merger activities .",
    "in order to focus on the consequences of the fossil electrons , the _ in situ _ injection is suppressed ; that is , we assume that the _ in situ _ injected and accelerated population is negligible compared to the re - accelerated population of the fossil electrons .",
    "we also assume that the nonthermal pressure of the fossil electrons is dynamically insignificant , thus , the sole purpose of adopting the fossil electrons is to supply seed electrons into the dsa process at the shock .",
    "finally , we assume that the background gas has @xmath86 .",
    "we consider several models whose parameters are summarized in table 1 . in all the models ,",
    "the preshock temperature is fixed at @xmath87 kev , and the preshock magnetic field strength at @xmath88 with the immediate postshock magnetic field strength , @xmath89 during 60 myr . for the fiducial model , m3.0c1 ,",
    "the initial shock speed is @xmath90 , corresponding to the initial shock mach number @xmath91 , at the onset of simulation , the width of the fossil electron cloud is @xmath92 kpc , and the fossil electron population is specified with the power - law slope @xmath93 and the cutoff lorentz factor @xmath94 . the shock speed and mach number decrease by @xmath4 % or so during 60 myr in this model as well as in other models in the table ( see paper i ) .",
    "in the m3.0c1 g and m3.0c1s models , different populations of fossil electrons are considered with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the mach number dependence is explored with three additional models , m2.5c1 , m3.3c1 , and m4.5c1 .",
    "the effects of the cloud size are examined in the m3.0c2 , m3.0c3 , and m3.0c4 models with @xmath97 , 155 , and 263 kpc , respectively . in the m3.0c4 model",
    ", the shock stays inside the fossil electron cloud until 92 myr , so the spectral steepening comes from radiative cooling only .",
    "lastly , the sc1pex1 model is the same one considered in paper i , in which the initial shock mach number , @xmath98 , was chosen to match the steep spectral curvature above 1.5 ghz in the observed spectrum of the sausage relic @xcite .",
    "note that in this model the shock mach number decreases to @xmath99 at 60 my , which is lower than @xmath100 derived from x - ray observations @xcite    figure 1 compares the evolution of the synchrotron emissivity , @xmath101 , in the m3.0c1 , m3.0c1 g , and m3.0c3 models ( from top to bottom panels ) at age @xmath102 18 , 45 , 55 , and 66 myr ( from left to right panels ) .",
    "in the left - most panels at 18 myr , the shock at @xmath103 has penetrated 52 kpc into the cloud in the three models .",
    "the shock is about to exit out of the cloud at 45 myr in the m3.0c1 and m3.0c1 g models and at 55 myr in the m3.0c3 model . in the right - most panels ,",
    "the edge of the radio emitting region is located behind the shock front ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the comparison of m3.0c1 and m3.0c1 g models indicates that the postshock radio emission does not sensitively depend on the cutoff in the fossil electron spectrum for the range , @xmath105 , considered here .",
    "the distributions of @xmath101 of the m3.0c1 and m3.0c1 g models at 55 myr look similar to that of m3.0c3 at 66 myr except that the downstream volume is slightly larger in the m3.0c3 model .",
    "note that the fossil electrons in the cloud start to cool from the onset of the simulations .",
    "figure 2 compares the evolutions of the electron spectrum and the radio spectrum in the m3.0c1 ( upper four panels ) and m3.0c1 g ( lower four panels ) models at the same @xmath78 as in figure 1 .",

    "note that here the _ in - situ _ injection / acceleration was suppressed in order to focus on the re - acceleration of fossil electrons ( see section 2.4 ) .",
    "the shape of @xmath119 is significantly different in the two models in the momentum range of @xmath120 due to different exponential cutoffs in the initial seed populations .",
    "once the re - acceleration of seed electrons has stopped at @xmath121 45 myr , the gradual steepening of the integrated electron spectrum progresses , as can be seen in the red dashed and long - dashed lines for both @xmath115 and its slope @xmath122 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath118 is related with the electron slope as @xmath123 , which is exact only in the case of a single power - law electron spectrum . before the shock exits the cloud",
    ", the integrated spectral index increases from @xmath124 to @xmath125 over a broad range of frequency , @xmath126 ghz ( see the red solid and dotted lines ) .",
    "but after @xmath76 , the integrated index @xmath35 becomes much steeper at high frequencies ( see the red dashed and long dashed lines ) due to the combined effects of radiative cooling and the lack of re - acceleration at the shock front .",
    "this suggests that breaking out of the finite - size cloud of fossil electrons may explain the steepening of the integrated spectrum well beyond the radiative cooling alone .",
    "the comparison of @xmath33 ( or @xmath35 ) of the two models shown in the figure indicates there is only a marginal difference at low frequencies below 0.5 ghz , although they have different exponential cutoffs in the seed populations .      as in paper",
    "i , the radio intensity or surface brightness , @xmath127 , is calculated by adopting the geometric volume of radio - emitting electrons in figure 1 of @xcite : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the distance behind the projected shock edge in the plane of the sky , @xmath130 is the radial distance from the cluster center , and @xmath131 is the path length along line of sights . here , we set the extension angle @xmath132 , slightly larger than @xmath133 adopted in paper i , in order to reproduce the observed width of the sausage relic .",

    "in the comparison model sc1pex1 of paper i ( green dot - dashed line ) , the shock stays inside the fossil electron cloud and so the spectral curvature is due to only radiative cooling .",
    "although the initial mach number , @xmath98 , was chosen for this model to explain the steep spectrum above 1.5  ghz , yet the abrupt increase of the curvature near 1  ghz could not be reproduced .",
    "figure 6 shows that the observed spectrum of the sausage relic can be fitted reasonable well by all four models with @xmath174 kpc and @xmath175 at about 10  my after the shock has exited out of the fossil cloud ( red dotted lines ) .",
    "they generate much better fit compared to the sc1exp1 model . in m3.3c1 model , for instance ,",
    "the shock mach number decrease to @xmath176 at @xmath177 myr and the integrated spectrum at that epoch is in a very good agreement with the observed spectrum . but",
    "considering that the width of @xmath137 of the m3.0c1 model agrees a bit better with the observations ( see figure 4 ) , we designate m3.0c1 as the fiducial model here .",
    "these simulation results demonstrate that the observed spectrum of the sausage relic with steep curvature could be explained naturally by the shock passage over a finite - size cloud of fossil electrons without invoking any additional physical processes other than the synchrotron / ic coolings .",
    "in @xcite ( paper i ) , we proposed a model for radio _ gischt _ relics in which a spherical shock sweeps through an elongated cloud of the icm thermal gas with an additional population of fossil relativistic electrons . at the shock , the fossil electrons are re - accelerated to radio - emitting energies ( @xmath178 ) and beyond , producing a diffuse radio source .",
    "we argued in paper i that such a model may explain the following characteristics of giant radio relics : ( 1 ) the low occurrence of radio relics compared to the expected frequency of shocks in merging clusters , ( 2 ) the uniform surface brightness along the length of arc - like relics , and ( 3 ) the spectral curvature in the integrated radio spectrum that runs over @xmath171 .",
    "but we were not able to reproduce the abrupt increase of the integrated spectral index , @xmath35 ( @xmath179 ) , above @xmath180 ghz , detected in the observed spectra of some relics including the sausage relic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in an effort to explain steep curved radio spectra , in this paper , we explore the possibility that the shock breaks out of a finite - size cloud of fossil electrons , leading to the volume - integrated electron spectrum much steeper than expected from the simple radiative aging alone . to that end , we performed time - dependent , dsa simulations of one - dimensional , spherical shocks with the parameters relevant for the sausage relic , which sweep through fossil electron clouds of @xmath181 kpc in width . in the fiducial model , m3.0c1 , the shock has initially @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) , breaks out of the cloud of 131 kpc after the crossing time of @xmath184 myr , and decelerates to @xmath185 ( @xmath154 ) at @xmath186 myr . as in paper",
    "i , we assume that the fossil electron population has a power - law spectrum with exponential cutoff .",
    "we also consider various models with different fossil electron populations or shock mach numbers , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "we then calculate the radio surface brightness profile , @xmath137 , and the volume - integrated spectrum , @xmath33 , adopting the downstream volumes with the same geometrical structure assumed in paper i.    we find that a shock of @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( e.g. , the m3.0c1 and m3.3c1 models ) , which has exited the fossil electron cloud of 131 kpc about 10 myr ago , can leave radio - emitting electrons behind , which produce both @xmath137 and @xmath33 consistent with the observations reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the detailed shape of @xmath33 depends on the spectrum of fossil electrons ( e.g. , the slope , @xmath189 , and the cutoff energy , @xmath85 ) as well as the shock mach number and the magnetic field strength , the ensuing radio spectrum may explain the steepening of @xmath33 above @xmath0 ghz , seen in the sausage relic , by adjusting the time since the break - out , @xmath190 .",
    "as emphasized in paper i , the single power - law radio spectrum is valid only for a steady planar shock with age much longer than 100 myr ( see equation ( [ fbr ] ) ) . for a spherically expanding shock at younger age ,",
    "the integrated radio spectrum should be curved in the range of @xmath191 . in this study",
    ", we further demonstrate that the spectral index could be much bigger than @xmath192 at high frequencies , if the shock sweeps out of the fossil electron cloud of finite size .",
    "we conjecture that the typical value of @xmath190 for observed giant radio relics would be of order of 10 myr , because , if much longer than that , the radio flux density decreases quickly due to fast cooling after the shock breaks out of the cloud ( see figures 3 and 4 ) . in such cases ,",
    "the spatial offset between the projected shock front and the edge of the radio relic is of order of 10 kpc , which is too small to be resolved with currently available observation facilities .",
    "note that such a difference can not explain the large spatial offset of @xmath61 kpc between the x - ray discontinuity and the edge of the toothbrush relic @xcite .",
    "in addition , with the offset , the shock mach number , @xmath193 , derived from the local spectral index , @xmath194 , observed at the relic edge is expected to be slightly lower than the actual shock mach number , for instance , the mach number , @xmath195 , if the shock can be detected in x - ray observations .",
    "this is contrary to the observed trend that in some radio relics @xmath196",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such discrepancies , large spatial offsets and/or different mach number estimates , should be understood by other reasons , for instance , the projection effect of multiple shock surfaces along line of sights in x - ray and radio observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
