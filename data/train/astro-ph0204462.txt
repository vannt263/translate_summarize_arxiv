    "rapid growth in the number of quasars discovered with @xmath9 has taken place in the last few years ( warren et al .",

    "we are thus now able to probe the quasar phenomenon in a new regime of high luminosity and youth that is important for understanding the structure of quasars and their evolution . at the present time , there are about 130 qsos identified at @xmath9 ( ned 2002 ) , but x - ray data for these sources remain sparse , especially for the radio - quiet majority ( bechtold et al .",

    "the x - ray continuum in active nuclei is thought to arise in a comptonized wind or corona associated with the inner accretion disk around a super - massive black hole ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ; czerny & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "additional components of the x - ray emission are also commonly seen in high signal to noise spectra at low redshift , including x - rays associated with beamed synchrotron plasma ; compton reflected emission ; line emission in fe k@xmath6 ; weak absorption from warm ionized material ; and strong absorption from cold material ( see george et al .",
    "2000 , reeves & turner 2000 and references therein ) . whether or not there is evolution in the structure of quasars with redshift can in principle be learned from x - ray spectroscopy of high redshift quasars .",
    "we report here a survey with the chandra x - ray observatory , of optically selected , radio - quiet high redshift quasars .",
    "this project is part of our long - term program to characterize the multi - wavelength emission from quasars as a function of redshift ( bechtold et al .",
    "1994 ab , kuhn et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the statistical properties of the ensemble population of quasars evolve strongly with redshift : the break point , l@xmath10 , of the luminosity function shifts to higher luminosities by a factor of @xmath350 between z=0 and z=2 ( boyle , fong , shanks & peterson 1987 ) .",
    "we hope to understand this evolution in terms of a physical model for the evolution of individual objects : does this evolution reflect slow changes in a few rare objects , or a short - lived phase that most galaxies go through ? are there differences in the spectral evolution of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ? can these be used to understand the origin of the radio emission ?",
    "the x - ray photons , whose production is closely linked to processes in the central engine , should provide direct clues to the physical conditions in the central few parsecs , where most of the quasar energy is produced , and will therefore help answer these questions . with the recent suggestion that reionization of the intergalactic medium happened at @xmath11 ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is possible that @xmath12 is the epoch when the first quasars were born .",
    "thus , the quasars targeted in our survey are among the first objects formed in the universe .",
    "high redshift quasars are rare , and require pointed observations at known objects for study ; our expectation is that xmm and chandra serendipitous surveys will not cover sufficient area on the sky to find many of them .",
    "the increase in sensitivity provided by chandra and xmm however make it possible to increase significantly the number of @xmath9 quasars with x - ray data with only a relatively modest investment of telescope time per object .",
    "we chose targets from samples of high redshift quasars , based on their optical luminosity .",
    "the quasars were found in optical surveys , including the apm multicolor survey ( williger et al .",
    "1994 ; storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) , the second palomar observatory sky survey ( smith et al . 1994 ; kennefick et al .",
    "1995ab ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( fan et al . 1999 , 2000",
    "; becker et al . 2001 ) .",
    "subsequent observations with first and nvss confirm that are all but one are radio quiet ( stern et al .",
    "2000 ; fan et al . 2001b ; ned 2002 ) .",
    "since these quasars are unusually bright , they have been the subject of other studies , including high quality optical spectrosopy to study the emission lines ( constantin et al .",
    "2001 ) and absorption lines ( storrie - lombardi et al . 2001 ; peroux , storrie - lombardi & mcmahon 2001 ) .",
    "we calculated observing times required to detect the quasars in x - rays with 100 photons , if the quasar had the average optical to x - ray flux ratio seen at lower redshift , so that we would be assured of a detection ( 9 - 10 photons ) if the quasar were more x - ray weak .",
    "in fact , we detected all but one quasar in the sample .",
    "observations of three quasars were taken from the public archive , to extend our sample to @xmath4 .",
    "seventeen quasars were observed with the chandra x - ray observatory and advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s , garmire et al .",
    ", in preparation ; weisskopf & odell 1997 ) .",
    "all the observations were taken with the quasar on the acis - s3 ccd , and reduced with the standard pipe - line reduction software , and ciao ( 2002 ; version 2.2 ) .",
    "initially , we pointed off - axis to mitigate pile - up in anticipation of high count rates , but later moved the quasar position on axis .",
    "pile - up is negligible for all observations in our survey .",
    "the observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we list the exposure times , observation times and net counts detected . for every object except pss 1435 + 3057",
    ", we detected a significant x - ray source within 1 arcsec of the optical position , so there is no doubt to the identification .",
    "for pss 1435 + 3057 , we give a 3@xmath13 upper limit to the x - ray photons at the optical position . there is a weak source ( 11 photons ) located 3.8 arcsec from the optical position .",
    "this source is beyond the range of aspect errors ( aldcroft 2002 ) , but may be associated with an extended structure from the quasar ( c.f .",
    "schwartz 2002 ) .    in table 2 , we list x - ray flux rates and other x - ray parameters . although the number of photons detected is small , we were able to derive meaningful spectral fits .",
    "we used sherpa ( ciao 2002 , version 2.2 ) to fit power law parameters to the counts , including absorption by the milky way column density of neutral hydrogen fixed at the value inferred from 21-cm maps ( colden 2002 , which is based on dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",

    "we restricted our fits to the range 0.3 - 6.5 kev , where the calibration is reliable at the present time , and the chandra background is the lowest .",
    "the source extraction region for each quasar was a circle with 10 pixels ( 4.92 arcsec ) radius .",

    "the @xmath59 radio - quiet quasars are clearly more x - ray quiet than their low - redshift counterparts , even when their extreme luminosity is taken into account .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. avni , worrall & morgan 1995 ; brandt et al . 2001 ; and references therein ) found that @xmath39 depends mostly on optical luminosity , although the correlation of luminosity and redshift in the observed samples made it difficult to sort out whether @xmath39 depended mostly on optical luminosity or redshift ( e.g. bechtold et al .",
    "1994 ; pickering , impey & foltz 1994 ) .",
    "the chandra sample also suffers from a strong correlation between redshift and luminosity . in figure 1 the three chandra quasars at @xmath60",
    "are strikingly offset from the rosat quasars to larger @xmath39 , while in figure 2 they show no offset .",
    "this is likely due to the newer surveys from which they are taken which cover larger solid angle than those used to select the rosat high z quasars . as a result",
    "they find systematically more luminous quasars .    to quantify the result , we computed the generalized kendall s tau , including lower limits on @xmath39 for quasars not detected at high redshift ( avni 1976 ; avni , soltan , tananbaum & zamorani 1980 ; feigelson & nelson 1985 ; avni & tananbaum 1986 ; isobe , feigelson & nelson 1986 ; akritas & siebert 1996 ) .",
    "we used the iraf program bhkmethod to search for correlations between ( 1 ) redshift and @xmath39 and ( 2 ) absolute b magnitude and @xmath39 .",

    "the probability is 0.05 that @xmath39 is not correlated with absolute b - magnitude ( z - value=1.9 ) .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath39 depends primarily on redshift , and weakly on luminosity .",
    "does this conclusion depend upon our assumptions for the x - ray spectral index , @xmath61 ?",

    "the high redshift quasars if anything are flatter ( smaller @xmath15 ) than their low redshift counterparts .",

    "@xmath39 by @xmath30.3 , making the difference between low- and high- redshift greater .",
    "thus the assumed spectral indices can not account for the result .",
    "figures 1 and 2 confirm the result seen previously that radio - loud quasars are more x - ray loud than radio quiet quasars , at all redshifts and luminosities .",
    "although we have emphasized how x - ray quiet the high redshift quasars are given their optical luminosity , they are still prodigious emitters of x - ray photons . in table 3",
    ", we list the x - ray luminosity ( erg s@xmath17 ) , in the 2 - 10 kev band , computed from the fits in table 2 .",

    "after submission of this paper , three papers were submitted to the _ astrophysical journal letters _ about the chandra observations of sds 0836 + 0054 , sds 1306 + 0356 and sds 1030 + 0524 .",
    "these quasars were observed with director s discretionary time and were placed in the public archive immediately .",
    "brandt et al . ( 2002 ) and mathur , wilkes & ghosh ( 2002 ) report fluxes for the three quasars and conclude , contrary to the results reported here , that the optical - to - x - ray flux ratios of these three highest redshift quasars are not significantly different from those of low redshift quasars . the different conclusion is a result of the different comparison samples used , which in both papers were smaller than the one presented here .",
    "schwartz ( 2002 ) reported not only the core fluxes for the three quasars , but also argued that an x - ray source 23@xmath63 from sds 1306 + 0356 with no optical counterpart on the palomar sky survey is in fact associated with the quasar .",
    "he postulates that the x - rays are compton scattered cosmic microwave background photons from a jet structure , similar to those seen at lower redshift ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ; celotti , ghisellini & chiaberge 2001 ; siemiginowska et al .",
    "future observations can confirm this intriguing result . in our sample , as discussed above , we see a similar source 3.8@xmath63 from the optical position of pss 1435 + 3057 .    for the core x - ray fluxes , we measure slightly different values than those reported in the three other papers .",
    "we measure 24 , 10 and 19 photons for sds 0836 + 0054 , sds 1306 + 0356 and sds 1030 + 0524 , respectively .",
    "schwartz ( 2002 ) measures 21 , 6 , 16 photons ; mathur , wilkes & ghosh ( 2002 ) measure 21 , 6 , 18 photons ; and brandt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measure 21 , 6 and 17 photons .",
    "the difference lies in two factors : the energy range used ( we use 0.3 - 6.5 kev , whereas the others use 0.5 - 7 kev or 0.5 - 8 kev ) and the difference in circle radius used for source extraction ( we use 4.9 @xmath63 , whereas they use 1.2 - 2.9 @xmath63 ) .",
    "we chose the 0.3 - 6.5 kev range because it has the lowest background , and the larger circle extraction to include the point spread function at all energies .",
    "the result is a greater number of net photons for all sources , and a more reliable measure of the source properties .",
    "figure 3 suggests that the x - ray spectral index flattens at high redshifts .",
    "this could be caused by two effects .",
    "first , as the redshift increases , the observed x - ray band samples greater and greater energies .",
    "thus , the flattening may be caused by intrinsic flattening of the power law at high energies .",
    "second , the quasars in our survey may have flatter intrinsic spectra at all energies , due to their high luminosities , or high redshift .",
    "we applied kendall s generalized tau to investigate the dependance of @xmath15 on redshift and optical luminosity .",
    "we did not include objects for which a power law index had not been measured .",
    "we found that @xmath15 is anti - correlated with redshift ( kendall s tau=-0.4319 , z - value = 8.46 ) and positively correlated with luminosity ( kendall s tau=0.2330 , z - value = 4.57 ) .",
    "the data suggests that @xmath15 depends strongly on both redshift and luminosity .",
    "we note that at the redshifts of the quasars in our sample , the usable chandra energy range , 0.3 - 6.5 kev , corresponds to relatively hard x - rays , 1.5 kev to 32 kev .",
    "therefore , we expect absorption by intervening damped ly@xmath6 systems and other intervening absorbers to be neglible , unless the absorbers are at low redshift . since we chose the sample objects to avoid known broad - absorption line quasars ( see green et al .",
    "2001 ) , intrinsic absorption is also probably negligible .",
    "we discuss the special case of sds 1030 + 0524 at @xmath4 below .",
    "a successful model for explaining the optical / ultraviolet continuum of quasars ( the big blue bump ) involves accretion onto a supermassive black hole through an optically thick , physically thin disk ( shields 1978 ; malkan 1983 ; bechtold et al .",
    "1987 ; czerny & elvis 1987 ; sun & malkan 1989 ) .",
    "the emitted spectrum is then the integral of planck spectra of different temperatures , resulting in a flat continuum , @xmath66 through the optical - uv .",
    "there is a near exponential falloff blueward of a cutoff energy , e@xmath67 , since there is a maximum temperature for the accreting material , nearest the black hole . for the supermassive black holes in quasars accreting near the eddington limit ,",
    "the cutoff is e@xmath67 @xmath3 10 - 100 ev .",
    "the spectral shape and luminosity of the accretion disk can be predicted and depends on five parameters : the black hole mass ( m@xmath68 ) ; the mass accretion rate @xmath69 ; the total angular momentum ; the viscosity in the disk , @xmath6 ; and the inclination at which we observe the disk . if we make the usual assumptions that the black hole is maximally spinning ( kerr black hole ; see elvis , risalti & zamorani 2002 ) , that we are observing the disk face - on , and that the viscosity @xmath6=0.1 , then the spectral energy distribution and luminosity depends on two parameters , m@xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "malkan ( 1990 ) showed that for a kerr black hole , an analytical expression for the emitted spectrum is    @xmath70    where a and @xmath71 are the normalization and cutoff frequency .",
    "the cut - off energy can then be written ( wandel 2000 ) as    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the black hole mass , in units of @xmath74 solar masses .",
    "observationally , is it also possible to relate m@xmath68 to the width of the broad emission lines , assuming the blr gas is in keplerian motion , and calibrating the size ( and hence ionization parameter ) of the gas by reverberation mapping of low - redshift agn ( peterson & wandel 1999 ; wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "thus , with two observations  the width of h@xmath7 and the continuum luminosity  we can solve for the two free parameters of the model , @xmath75 and @xmath69 ( wandel & petrosian 1988 ; wandel & boller 1998 ; wandel 1999 ) . in figures 4 and 5",

    "we now use the x - ray measurements to further investigate the nature of the black hole and accretion in quasars .",
    "janiuk & czerny ( 2000 ) have presented calculations of the x - ray spectrum expected from a hot corona associated with an accretion disk .",
    "the model predicts the fraction of energy dissipated in the corona as a function of the disk radius .",
    "the coronal dissipation is assumed to be proportional to the gas pressure , and the pressure at the base of the corona is determined by the condition for the disk / corona transition .",
    "this requirement is consistent with the evaporation / condensation equilibrium condition ( rozanska & czerny 2000 ) and effectively means that bremsstrahlung and compton cooling at the base of the corona are comparable .",
    "the spectrum from the disk and the corona are computed locally , taking into account the comptonization in the hot coronal plasma .",
    "the observed model spectrum is integrated over the disk surface .",

    "they convincingly argue that the absorption is far stronger than what is predicted from a simple extrapolation of the ly@xmath6 forest from lower redshift , so that they have detected a gunn - peterson trough .",

    "the column of the redshifted absorption and normalization of the flux were free parameters .",
    "significant absorption was not detected , and we can place a 3@xmath13 upper limit to the absorbing column of 7.6@xmath9110@xmath92 atoms @xmath18 if the igm has solar abundance , and 5.3@xmath9110@xmath93 atoms @xmath18 if the igm has hydrogen and helium only , at the solar ratio . in either case , the the chandra data imply that at the lyman limit , @xmath5 at redshift @xmath94 .",
    "we have studied the evolution of quasars from @xmath95 to the present day , putting together what is known about the optical continuum luminosities , broad emission line widths , and x - ray flux and spectrum .",
    "the data are consistent with a model where the optical - ultraviolet continuum arises in a cold , thin , optically thick accretion disk , and the x - rays are produced at high redshift by a comptonized corona . at low redshift ,",
    "extra components are likely making the x - ray spectrum more complex than the simple power law fits available so far for most objects .",
    "the high redshift quasars have systematically more massive central black holes than their low - redshift counterparts , and are accreting at high rates , several tenths of the eddington limit . their observed relatively weak x - ray fluxes are a natural outcome of the accretion disk - coronal models , with no cold absorption necessary to suppress the x - ray emission ( c.f .",
    "brandt et al . 2001 ; mathur 2001 ) .",
    "the chandra observations require large values of the viscosity parameter , @xmath84 for the high redshift quasars .",
    "numerical simulations show that the turbulent part of the @xmath6 parameter is negligible in comparison to the magnetic term arising from magnetorotational instability and @xmath6 should be within 0.001 - 0.1 ( balbus & hawley 1998 , armitage 1998 , armitage et al 2001 ) .",
    "observational constraints based on agn variability are limited ( siemiginowska & czerny 1989 ) , but in general they are in agreement with the theoretical predictions , although for high disk luminosities @xmath6 exceeds 0.1 for the pg sample of quasars ( starling et al 2002 ) .",
    "we conclude that even at the highest redshifts probed to date , quasars were producing prodigious ultraviolet and soft - x - ray photons , which no doubt had interesting effects on the intergalactic medium and formation of galaxies at the earliest times .",
