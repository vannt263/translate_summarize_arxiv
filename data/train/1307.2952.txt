    "since the launch of modern x - ray space telescopes like and x - ray observatories , x - ray astronomy has entered the epoch of grating observations that can produce spectra with much improved energy resolution . in these spectra narrow absorption / emission lines , which have never been observed before , now have been commonly detected .",
    "these x - ray absorption / emission lines can be generated in a variety of astronomical environments , e.g. , stellar coronae ( sc ) , supernova remnants , x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , galaxies , agn , and interstellar media ( ism ) and intergalactic media ( igm ) ( e.g. , ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these lines carry valuable information about the absorbing / emitting material and thus are powerful diagnostic tools for stellar evolution , explosion mechanism of sne , mass exchange in accretion systems , interplays of different galactic components , feedback of agn , galaxy formation and evolution , evolution of our universe , and so on . clearly , proper identifications of these lines and subsequent scientific derivation and interpretation strongly rely on the accuracy of atomic databases of responsible transitions .",
    "there are several available databases of atomic transitions , among which the most commonly referenced four in x - ray community are verner et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter v96 ) , nist , xstar ( @xcite ) , and aped ( @xcite ) . while atomic data for ions at high - charge states ( e.g. , he- and h - like ions ) are very accurate in these databases and consistent with observations ( juett et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 , j0406 hereafter ; yao et al .",
    "2009 , y09 hereafter ) , those for k transitions of neutral and mildly ionized metal elements ( e.g. ,  ,  ,  , etc . )",
    "have not been included in any of them .",
    "there also exists other serious problems .",
    "first , although the statistical errors of the wavelengths of these high - ionized lines can be less than 10 m  in astronomical observations , they are still not enough for the study of the low - velocity gases .",
    "y09 have measured these high - ionized lines ; however , some lines have large uncertainties , such as  k@xmath0 that has a statistical error 6.7 m , equivalent to 125 @xmath1 . in addition , some lines ( e.g. ,  k@xmath2 ) are too weak to be given statistical errors .",
    "second , the methods commonly used ( e.g. , y09 ) to obtain the co - added spectrum introduce biases , which must be corrected and otherwise will result in serious estimation errors of the gas velocities as well as other parameters associated with the gas velocities .",
    "finally , some of the line wavelengths are not consistent with each other between the commonly referenced databases .",
    "for example , the wavelength of  k@xmath0 in nist is 18.6270   but is 18.6288   in v96 .",
    "the difference between the two values is @xmath3 @xmath1 , which is a serious problem for the study of the low - velocity gas .",
    "therefore , it is essential to make observational identifications of the k - shell transitions of the neutral , low - ionized , and high - ionized metals . since most of k transitions of these low - ionization ions are in the wavelength range of 9.524.0  , within which copious lines of highly ionized metal elements have also been observed , these missing atomic data are important not only for their own rights but also for proper identifications of other lines .",
    "recently , several groups have calculated and updated these databases ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but even the centroid wavelengths , the most basic parameters of these lines , are yet to be coincided ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in addition , the laboratory measurements are also very uncertain ; e.g. , the wavelength of  1s2p given by stolte et al . ( 1997 ) range from 23.489 to 23.536  .",
    "lccccc   & 1s2p & @xmath4 & @xmath5 & @xmath6 & @xmath6 +   & 1s3p & @xmath7 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath7 +   & 1s2p & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 +   & 1s3p & @xmath7 & @xmath14 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 +   & 1s2p & @xmath15 & @xmath7 & @xmath16 & @xmath7 +   & 1s3p & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 +   & 1s3p & @xmath7 & @xmath17 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 +   & 1s2p & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 +   & 1s3p & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath22 +   & 1s2p & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 +   & 1s3p & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath26 +   & 1s3p & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 +   & 1s2p & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 +   & 1s3p & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7 & @xmath7    some galactic x - ray sources are very bright in the soft x - ray band . when the x - ray continuous radiations pass through the ism in different phases , x - ray absorption lines of ions at various charge states are produced and thus are excellent calibration references for these atomic data .",
    "for instance , schattenburg & canizares ( 1986 ) used the einstein observations of the crab to obtain the wavelength of the neutral o ( 1s2p of ) , although the result is uncertain ( @xmath27  ) according to modern standard .",
    "j0406 analyzed _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) observations of several galactic xrbs and obtained the wavelengths of some strong lines ( i.e. , 1s2p of , , , ,  and 1s3p of ) .",
    "they found theoretically calculated line centroids of k transitions of low ionized neon and oxygen need to be shifted @xmath28 m  to match observed values , which corresponds to @xmath29 shift for oxygen- and neon - absorbers .",
    "however , the ism is rotating around the galactic center and thus the observed x - ray lines are not at the rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately , the above three previous works did not do the galactic rotation correction .",
    "it is also necessary to exclude x - ray sources with significant intrinsic absorptions , such as accreting x - ray binaries with winds from either their companions or accretion disks along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "this can be done easily by comparing absorption line and/or total absorption properties of a target with multiple observations , since all x - ray binaries exhibit significant variability .    although x - ray absorption lines produced in the ism are indeed ideal sources for calibrating theoretical predictions of atomic transitions , high spectral quality is crucial to accomplishing this important task .",
    "the measurements by j0406 are based on relatively poor quality spectra ( with signal - to - noise ratio snr@xmath30 per 10-mspectral bin ) obtained with short observations of several sources ; thus only those strong transitions ( e.g. , 1s2p of , , and ) were relatively well constrained , and others were still of large uncertainties ( @xmath31 m ) or not observed .",
    "recently y09 presented an extensive study of ism x - ray absorption lines in the spectrum of cyg  x2 observed with the _",
    "chandra_-hetg spectrograph .",
    "the high spectral quality not only allowed them to measure most of the transitions listed by j0406 as accurate as @xmath32 m  ( 1@xmath33 uncertainty ) but also enabled them to constrain other faint transitions not included and/or misidentified in their list .",
    "for instance , y09 detected and measured the 1s3p transition of that could not be revealed in previous poor quality spectra , and they did not confirm the reported line at 23.140   that was misidentified as 1s3p transition of .    in this work , our aim is to obtain more accurate k transition data of neutral , low- and high - ionized metals , as well as to find some weak absorption lines ( e.g. , 1s2p of  ; 1s3p of  ) .",
    "we jointly analyze 36 _",
    "chandra_-hetg observations of 11 galactic xrbs and give the most accurate wavelengths for k - shell transitions of neutral , low- and high - ionized atoms . in section 2",
    "we describe our methods of extracting the x - ray spectra and correcting for the galactic rotation . in section 3",
    "we present the results of a joint analysis of all the observational data . in section 4",
    "we estimate systematic uncertainties and make necessary corrections to the detected lines .",
    "a discussion and summary are given in section 5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "in order to obtain high snr continuum spectra and absorption lines , we adopt the following criteria to select the sample :    * only the galactic low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are used as the background light sources .",
    "compared to extragalactic sources ( e.g. , agns ) , galactic xrbs are usually located at low galactic latitudes and thus the column densities of the ism along the los are usually large if they are not too close to us .",
    "thus strong absorption lines are expected in their spectra .",
    "high mass x - ray binaries are excluded to avoid any possible contamination caused by their stellar winds that may not be stationary ( e.g. , cyg x1 ; @xcite ) ; * sources with intrinsic absorptions or emissions ( e.g. , gx 3394 , @xcite ; 4u 191605 , @xcite ) are excluded ; * only sources with galactic latitudes more than 2 degrees are chosen to avoid too heavy galactic absorptions .",
    "most lines we concern are at wavelengths above 10   and the photons in this band suffer heavy absorption in the galactic plane , which can reduce the significance of the line fitting ( appendix a ) ; * only hetg observations are used to assure a high spectral resolution ; * in order to ensure that there are significant absorption lines , we only include the sources for which the strongest o line ( 1s2p of ) and the strongest ne line ( 1s2p of ) ( figures 1 and 2 ) are detected in the pipe - line - produced spectra .",
    "we choose  k@xmath2 as an indicator , although it is always intrinsically weaker than  k@xmath2 lines ; the latter are not detected from several sources due to the rapidly decreasing effective area of the hetg at wavelengths longer than 20  .",
    "finally , 36 _ chandra_-hetg observations of 11 lmxbs are selected as listed in table 2 .",

    ", we use the mean position of the crosses between the ccd read - out streaks and each of the two arms ( heg and meg ) as the source positions for te - mode observations , and use two gaussian profiles to fit the compressed image to determine the source positions for cc - mode observations .",
    "our purpose is to obtain the wavelengths of the absorption lines accurately and thus we must correct for the fact that the line - absorbing gas is not at rest with respect to the local standard rest frame ( lsr ) .",
    "the gas in the galactic plane is rotating around the galactic center and the rotation velocity increases as the radius decreases .",
    "the absorption lines in x - ray band are produced by the multi - phase ism along the los , and the motions are also different for the ism in different phases .",

    "data are derived from the leiden argentine bonn ( lab ) galactic  survey ( ) that has a @xmath50 spatial grid and 1.3 @xmath1 velocity resolution . to obtain the average profile ( @xmath51 ) of the  21 cm emission toward the source",

    "then we can obtain the average  velocity from @xmath51 and use this value as the projected velocity of the neutral or low - ionized gas along the los .    for high - ionized gas , as its scale height is much larger than the low - ionized gas , the halo - lagging effect ( rand 1997 , 2000 )",
    "must be considered .",
    "here , we follow the three assumptions in y09 : ( 1 ) the density of the hot gas is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the gas density in the galactic plane and @xmath57 is the height from the galactic plane and @xmath58 = 3 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) the rotation velocity linearly decreases from @xmath49 to zero at a height @xmath59 = 8 kpc ( rand 1997 ) above the galactic disk ; ( 3 ) the velocity at radii between @xmath48 and @xmath43 can be linearly interpolated from @xmath49 and @xmath44 . for the lsr ,",
    "we take @xmath48 = 8 kpc and @xmath49 = 220 @xmath1 .",
    "the rotation velocity near the target can be inferred from the smallest ( largest ) velocity of the  emission and then the average velocity of the hot gas can be obtained by integrating all the gas with different @xmath43 and @xmath44 in los .",
    "the average velocities of the neutral or low - ionized gas and high - ionized hot gas are listed in table 2 .",
    "we transform all the spectra to the lsr and then use the idl scripts _",
    "writepha _ and _ wrt_ogip_rmf _ to produce the spectrum file ( pha ) and the response file ( rsp = rmf @xmath60 arf ) respectively .",
    "in this section , we use two different methods to jointly analyze these 36 observations to obtain the wavelengths of the absorption lines of neutral , low - ionized , moderate - ionized and high - ionized gas ( table 4 ) .",
    "the result and discussion will be presented in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "the entire 36 spectra are co - added by the following two steps to increase the snr as the method described in y09 : ( 1 ) add the counts of each spectrum channel by channel to make a new spectrum file ( pha ) ; ( 2 ) merge all the response files to producing the response file ( rsp ) , where we use the total counts as the weights of each observation .",
    "we fit the co - added spectrum with xspec ( version 12.7.0 ) to analyze the co - added spectrum .",
    "the continuum is fitted using a power - law plus several broad gaussian functions and the absorption line is fitted by a narrow gaussian function , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the wavelength of the line centroid , @xmath63 is the width of the line and @xmath64 is the normalization of the line . from figures 3 and 4",
    ", it can be seen that the co - added spectrum has very high snr . as a result , many weak lines ( e.g. ,  k@xmath65 ) are visible .",
    "the snrs around the  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 , and  k@xmath2 lines are about 20 , 80 , 110 respectively .    merging",
    "the spectra by this method can generally increase the snr significantly .",
    "however , the spectra with weak lines may also weaken the snr .",
    "we take two observations ( obsid 6618 and 8599 ) as examples .",
    "the wavelength of  k@xmath2 is @xmath66   obtained from the obsid 6618 , whereas it is @xmath67   from the co - added spectrum with obsid 6618 and 8599 .",
    "the error actually increases as more observations are combined , since the significance of the absorption line in obsid 8599 is too low to increase the significance of the line in the co - added spectrum . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum with weak absorption lines can only increase the total counts of the continuum , which increases the background noise to the line ( figure 5 ) . to avoid this problem , another method of merging the spectra",
    "is investigated next .",
    "unlike the method in section 3.1 , we fit the spectrum to obtain the continuum and line parameters ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ) of each observation first .",
    "all data for each line flux are then merged to produce a co - added line flux after the removal of the continuum of each individual spectrum , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the flux of each co - added line flux , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the flux and weight for each line in each observation . in order to avoid the problem caused by the spectrum with weak ism absorption , we must evaluate @xmath71 carefully . here",
    ", the weight of each absorption line is given as ( appendix b ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the error of the continuum around the line , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the same as that defined in equation ( 4 ) .",
    "for the strong lines ( e.g. ,  k@xmath2 and  k@xmath2 ) , the significance is high enough to determine the line parameters for most observations , which can be used as the weight to merge the spectra .",
    "however , the significance of the weak lines ( e.g. ,  k@xmath2 and  k@xmath0 ) is too low and the line parameters can be obtained only in few observations . among all the 36 observations , @xmath76  k@xmath2 ; @xmath77 ; but @xmath76  k@xmath0 ; @xmath78 . to solve this problem",
    ", we make a simple assumption that the clouds in every los have the same ion fraction ( i.e. , all the lines in each spectrum have the same line - strength ratios ) . the ratios  k@xmath79  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath79  k@xmath0 , and  k@xmath79  k@xmath2 are shown in figure 6 , which proves the validity of the assumption . as shown in table 3 ,",
    "all the lines are divided into five groups and the strongest line of each group is also found",
    ". then we can use @xmath71 of the five strongest lines of each group to merge the spectra to obtain the wavelength of each line in each group .",

    "this error is so small that it may be used to measure the low - velocity gas , e.g. , the hot high - ionized gas in galactic halo . for the lines",
    "whose wavelengths are consistent between nist and v96 , our results are also consistent with those . for those lines",
    "whose wavelengths are inconsistent between nist and v96 , our results are closer to that in nist .",
    "compared to y09 , our results are two times more accurate ( e.g. ,  k@xmath2 ) and are also consistent with theoretical calculations except the  k@xmath2 and the  k@xmath2 lines ( table 10 ) . in our work , @xmath517 (  k@xmath518 is 7.5 m  lower than the value of 12.1339   in v96 .",
    "we note that nist does not include this line .",
    "the  k@xmath2 line is more complicated and it is also 10 m  lower than that in nist and v96 .",
    "we will discuss this in the next sub - section .",
    "unlike the high - ionized elements , in the soft x - ray band , there still exists large discrepancies between the astronomical observations and the theoretical calculations of k transitions of the low - ionized and moderate - ionized elements ( table 1 ) .",
    "in fact , some of these lines ( e.g. , 1s3p of  and 1s2p of ) have even never been detected .",
    "the co - added spectra have excellent snrs that provides us an unique opportunity to detect these weak absorption lines .",
    "we are particularly concerned about these transitions and thus search for the signals of these absorption lines around their theoretical values .",
    "for the 11 transitions of the low - ionized elements shown in table 8 , @xmath519 and @xmath520 .",
    "only @xmath521 (  k@xmath522 , but @xmath523 (  k@xmath524 .",
    "despite the low snrs , it is the first detection of the  k@xmath2 line so far .",
    "several moderate - ionized ions , i.e. , the o , ne , and mg lines shown in table 9 ( except the  k@xmath2 that has been detected in y09 ) , also appear for the first time around the theoretical values in the co - added spectra . as shown in table 9 , only @xmath521 (  k@xmath2 and  k@xmath525 . however , among the other lines , @xmath521 (  k@xmath2 and  k@xmath526 . moreover , the  k@xmath2 and  k@xmath2 lines are only present in the co - added spectrum of method 1 , which hints that these three lines may be artificial and need to be confirmed by higher quality observations in the future .    in y09 , only one of the 2d-3p double lines , i.e. , the  15.01   line was detected , but no statistical error was given . in our work , both  15.01   and 15.26   lines are detected significantly for the first time simultaneously ( figures 3 and 4 ; table 9 ) .",
    "all the lines with @xmath527 are shown in figure 11 .      by analyzing the co - add spectrum ,",
    "the wavelengths of all the strong absorption lines can be determined accurately . in our work ,",
    "several  lines , including even the very weak  k@xmath65 , are found . however , the wavelength of  k@xmath2 is still uncertain .",
    "the observations of cyg x2 and xte j1817330 are the most important components of the co - added spectrum , which have enough counts and thus can greatly determine the shape of the co - added spectrum . y09 jointly analyzed four _ chandra_-hetg observations of cyg x2 and found the  k@xmath0 line clearly but no  k@xmath2 line was detected .",
    "this problem can be interpreted by an unknown emission that fills in the absorption ( cabot et al .",
    "the spectrum of xte j1817330 is similar to cyg x2 but more complex , which can be caused by not only two absorption lines but also an absorption line plus an emission line .",
    "thus , the co - added spectrum can also be well fitted by two different models ( figure 12 ) . for the model of a strong absorption line plus a weak redshifted absorption line ,",
    "the fitting value of the  k@xmath2 line is @xmath528  .",
    "however , for the model of an absorption line plus a weak emission line , the fitting value is @xmath529  .",
    "both values are very different from the theoretical value of 21.6020   given by nist or 21.6019   given by v96 .",
    "we can not distinguish which model is correct due to the limitation of the snr of the spectrum .",
    "so far , the wavelengths of k alpha absorption lines of neutral , low - ionized , and moderate - ionized o , ne , and mg have not been determined precisely , either in theoretical calculations ( e.g. , v96 ; nist ) , laboratory measurements ( stolte et al . 1997 ) , or in astronomical observations ( j0406 ; y09 ) . in order to obtain the wavelengths of k transitions of o , ne , and mg more accurately , we jointly analyzed 36 _",
    "chandra_-hetg observations of 11 lmxbs at low galactic latitudes in this work .",
    "we corrected the galactic rotation velocity to the rest frame for every observation and then used two different methods to merge all the corrected spectra to a co - added spectrum .",
    "finally , we fit and obtained the wavelengths of every absorption line in the co - added spectrum obtained by the above two methods ( section 3 ) .",
    "both methods give similar and consistent results for most lines , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "we noted that the co - added spectra obtained by the usual methods ( methods 1 and 2 ) exhibit biases , which are very important for the calibration of the lines .",
    "the co - added spectrum can be biased to the observations of high counts ( method 1 ) or high snrs of the lines ( method 2 ) .",
    "we made bayesian analysis to the lines of the  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 to obtain the systematic uncertainty and the bias correction of the o , ne , and mg lines in all phases .",
    "the final results after the bias correction are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) for the the neutral , low - ionized , and high - ionized lines , the accuracy of our result is five and two times higher than j0406 and y09 respectively ( table 4 ) .",
    "several lines that were not detected ( i.e. ,  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath65 ,  k@xmath0 , and  k@xmath65 ) or too weak to give measurement errors ( i.e. ,  k@xmath0 ,  k@xmath65 and  k@xmath2 ) in y09 are detected clearly in our work .",
    "we also find the moderate - ionized lines of these elements (  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 ,  k@xmath2 , and  k@xmath0 ; table 9 ) whose significances are so low that need to be confirmed in the future . besides the remarkable improvement of the accuracy , it is worth mentioning that all the biases measurements here are corrected ( tables 810 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the systematic uncertainty in our measurement mainly comes from the galactic rotation correction and the spectral fitting .",
    "the former depends on the galactic model . for the latter , we make simulations to estimate the effect .",
    "the total systematic uncertainties are : @xmath530 m  and 0.6 mfor low - ionized and high - ionized o , @xmath531 0.4 m  and 0.5 m  for low - ionized and high - ionized ne , @xmath532 m  for mg lines ( table 7 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) for high - ionized lines of  k@xmath0 and  k@xmath2 , our results are consistent with that of nist , but 2 m  lower than v96 . for  k@xmath2 ,",
    "our result is about 8 m  lower than that given by v96 ; nist does not provide the theoretical value . for the moderate - ionized lines ,",
    "the discrepancy between our measurements and the theoretical calculations are generally between 1 to 80 m . because the statistical errors of these lines are also similar to the discrepancy , the measurements are consistent with the theoretical calculations .",

    "for the spectrum with a continuum plus a gaussian absorption line , the wavelength of the line center ( @xmath62 ) can be determined by line fitting with a gaussian function @xmath535 where @xmath536 , @xmath63 , and @xmath62 are the depth , broadening , and center wavelength of the line . as described in landman et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and lenz & ayres ( 1992 ) , @xmath534 ( the error of @xmath62 ) can be expressed as @xmath537 where @xmath33 is the error of the continuum around the line .",
    "for an observed spectrum , if the observation time is fixed , @xmath538 and @xmath536 can be expressed as @xmath539 and @xmath540 where @xmath541 is the flux of the continuum , @xmath542 and @xmath543 are the optical depths of the continuum and the line center , @xmath544 and @xmath545 are the cross sections for the continuum and the line center , and @xmath546 is the abundance of the ion producing the absorption line . thus @xmath547 can be written as @xmath548    we use the observation of the  k@xmath2 line in y09 to show the relationship between @xmath533 and @xmath534 . here",
    "@xmath549 is obtained from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) and @xmath550 is calculated from the observation in y09 . as shown in figure 13 , for either too low or too high @xmath533 the error of the  k@xmath2 can be increased significantly .",
    "in equation ( a2 ) , @xmath536 can also be described by @xmath551 , where @xmath64 is the normalization of the line .",
