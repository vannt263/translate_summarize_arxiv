    "topological superconductors@xcite and iron - based superconductors@xcite have been research focuses of condensed matter physics in recent years .",
    "topological superconductors have a full pairing gap in the bulk and gapless surface or edge andreev bound states known as majorana fermions .",
    "recent scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / s ) measurements observed a robust zero - energy bound state at randomly distributed interstitial excess fe sites in superconducting fe(te , se ) , and the behavior of zero - energy bound state resembles the majorana fermion@xcite .",
    "theoretically , one possible scenario accounting for this puzzle is that fe(te , se ) could be in a topological superconducting ( sc ) state .",
    "if it is the case , we can expect that nontrivial topology can integrate into the sc states in iron - based superconductors .",
    "recently , some studies@xcite have revealed that the band structures can be tuned to have nontrivial topological properties in monolayer fe(te , se ) and monolayer fese / sto .",
    "furthermore , in electron - doped monolayer fese / sto , the experimental measurements have observed high temperature superconductivity with @xmath1 over 65k@xcite .",
    "in analogy to the doped topological insulators , which are strongly believed to be topological superconductors@xcite , a natural question arises , can the electron - doped monolayer fese / sto be topological superconductors ?    in this paper , we propose that the electron - doped monolayer fese / sto could be an odd - parity topological superconductor in the spin - triplet orbital - singlet @xmath2-wave pairing channel . to show this exotic state",
    ", we first analyse the distinctive electronic structure of monolayer fese / sto , and present a systematic classification of the pairing symmetry in monolayer fese / sto from the lattice symmetric group .",
    "second , we discuss the topological properties of such odd - parity sc states , and extract the minimum effective models to capture the essential physics .",
    "third , we calculate the phase diagram of sc states according to different scenarios of effective pairing interaction .",
    "finally , we discuss the experimental signatures of the topological sc states .",
    "the lattice structure of monolayer fese is shown in fig .",
    "the two - fe unit cell includes two se and two fe labeled by a and b. the space group @xmath4 governs the se - fe - se trilayer structure , and belongs to a non - symmorphic group@xcite .",
    "indeed , there exists a @xmath5-glide plane described by the operator @xmath6 , which involves a fractional translation @xmath7 combining with the @xmath8-plane mirror . centered on an fe atom ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , eight point group operations , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , form a @xmath15 point group . together with an inversion followed by fractional translations @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath16 , they generate all the elements of @xmath4 .",
    "the 16 operations do not form a point group . however ,",

    "it is convenient to classify the pairing symmetry with the irreducible representation ( ir ) of @xmath17 . for this purpose ,",
    "one simple way is to recompose the bloch wave functions in the one - fe brillouin zone ( bz ) .    the glide plane symmetry @xmath18 divides the five @xmath19 orbitals into two groups ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) , and each group is recomposed to be the eigen - states of the glide plane operation with the definite orbital parities .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian can also be decomposed into two parts with inverse orbital parities , which allow us to transfer the two - fe unit cell picture into one - fe unit cell picture@xcite . in momentum space ,",

    "the fundamental difference between fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( f ) is referred to the band - renormalization effect induced by the strain from the sto substrate , which strongly modulates the hopping parameters between the ( @xmath35 ) orbitals and switches the positions of two doubly degenerate points @xmath36 and @xmath37 at @xmath38 high symmetric point , where the @xmath36 point mainly has ( @xmath20 ) orbital weight and the @xmath37 point mainly has @xmath39 orbital weight .",
    "this picture is the most natural and simplest to account for the distinctive electronic structure of monolayer fese / sto compared to other scenarios@xcite .",
    "the sc order parameters should follow the irs of the symmetry group of the system .",
    "it is safe to use @xmath17 to do so in the picture of one - fe unit cell according to our aforementioned arguments .",
    "there exist two kinds of symmetry - allowed cooper pairs , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 pairing channels .",

    "the price for coexistence of both kinds of pairings is that the orbital parities are mixed and the spatial inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "here we focus on an sc state with only one irs in @xmath40 pairing channel and leave to discuss the irrelevant @xmath41 pairing channel in appendix b. moreover , we only need to consider the pairings between the three @xmath42 orbitals as the orbital weight for @xmath43 orbitals are neglectable on the fermi surfaces@xcite .",

    "likewise , the tr symmetry or lattice symmetry could also be broken when two different one - dimensional irs or two components in a two - dimensional ir coexist . in order to gain some insight",
    "before we perform the numerical calculations , we note that all the experiments reported the isotropic fermi surface and gap structures without any resolvable distortions , and the monolayer fese / sto was conformed to be the cleanest composition with the simplest structure@xcite .",
    "these features rule out the possibilities of some complex orders , such as nematic order found in bulk fese . from table [ pairk - k ]",
    ", we can first eliminate the possibilities of the \\{@xmath66 : @xmath65 } , \\{@xmath64 : @xmath70 } , \\{@xmath43 : @xmath74 } and \\{@xmath64 : @xmath63 } pairing channels , because the leading inter-@xmath137-@xmath138 hopping term is proportional to @xmath268 , which is nearly zero around the fermi surface , and the \\{@xmath64 : @xmath63 } channel has nodes .",
    "second , it is straightforward to check that two components in \\{@xmath69 : @xmath67 } or \\{@xmath73 : @xmath269 } give two degenerate strip sc states with nodes .",
    "thus , the tr - broken linear combination of two components is optimal to achieve the isotropic nodeless gap structure and lower the energy .",
    "note that the coexistence of these two two - dimensional irs could rise the energy , because they follow different transformations under the lattice symmetric operations and suppress the gap amplitude .",

    "the essential difference lies in that the former one has even - parity and spin - singlet pairing while the latter one has odd - parity and spin - triplet pairing .",
    "therefore , it is unambiguous to adopt the experiments which can directly distinguish the spin states and parities to pin down the possible candidate .",
    "particularly , temperature dependence of the nuclear magnetic relaxation(nmr ) rate can be utilized to distinguish the two different pairings .",
    "the well - known result is that the nmr rate has a hebel - slichter peak at the sc transition temperature for the even - parity and spin - singlet s - wave sc state@xcite .",

    "it indicates the odd - parity pairing has a sign change or phase shift of @xmath284 between the top se and and bottom se layers along the @xmath285-axis compared with the even - parity pairing .",
    "thus , the standard magnetic - flux modulation of dc sc quantum interference devices ( squids ) measurements@xcite provide another scheme to distinguish the odd- and even - parity pairings . on the other hand ,",
    "some transport measurements can also be applied to detect the topological superconductors , such as the thermal hall conductivity@xcite .",
    "the challenge for such measurements is that the fese is very air sensitive , and the experimental measurements should be performed under the ultra - high vacuum condition .    in the aforementioned discussions about the sc pairings , we assume that the glide - plane symmetry is not broken .",
    "actually , there exist some possible effects to break the glide - plane symmetry .",
    "for example , the atomic spin - orbital coupling could be have non - neglectable effect in iron chalcogenides .",
    "it is explicit that the inter - orbital spin - orbital coupling can mix the bands with inverse orbital parities , and induce the inter - orbital sc pairing in @xmath41 channels .",
    "however , the weight of inter-@xmath137-@xmath39 spin - orbital coupling is proportional to @xmath286@xcite , while the inter-@xmath287-@xmath39 orbital hopping term with definite orbital parity is proportional to @xmath288 @xmath289 at the fermi surface .",
    "we can estimate that the ratio between the sc pairing order parameter in @xmath41 channel and that in @xmath290 channel should be @xmath291 0.025 .",
    "thus , the atomic spin - orbital coupling plays a neglectable  role in sc states , and the ref .",
    "@xcite verified this point in a@xmath201fe@xmath202se@xmath203 .",
    "other issues , such as the coupling between the monolayer fese and substrate sto , could also break the glide - plane symmetry .",
    "such couplings are tunable and strongly affected by the fabrication process and the substrate materials@xcite . here",
    ", we consider the case that the strength of coupling between the monolayer fese and substrate is weak in comparison with the relevant hopping amplitude .",
    "compared with the general topological materials , in which the extended @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals are the bricks to build low - energy electronic structures , and the spin - orbital coupling plays an essential role in inducing the strong linear couplings , the linear couplings in monolayer fese / sto is attributed to effective couplings between 3d orbitals induced by d - p hybridizations from the unique non - symmorphic lattice structures .",
    "such features provide us an alternative route to search for the new topological materials in strongly - correlative electronic systems .    in conclusion , we propose that the monolayer fese / sto could support the odd - parity topological sc states with the nodeless s - wave gap structures .",
    "in contrast with other topological superconductors@xcitein which the spin - orbital coupling plays a key role , such topological sc states have strong relations with the unique non - symmorphic lattice symmetry which induces the orbital - momentum locking . furthermore , we calculate phase diagram and suggest some experimental schemes to identify such uniquely nontrivial topological sc states .",
