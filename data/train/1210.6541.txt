    "set theorists often argue against the axiom of constructibility @xmath1 on the basis that it is restrictive .",
    "some argue that we have no reason to think that every set should be constructible , or as shelah puts it , `` why the hell should it be true ? ''",
    "@xcite . to suppose that every set is constructible is seen as an artificial limitation on set - theoretic possibility , and",
    "perhaps it is a mistaken principle generally to suppose that all structure is definable .",
    "furthermore , although @xmath1 settles many set - theoretic questions , it seems so often to settle them in the ` wrong ' way , without the elegant smoothness and unifying vision of competing theories , such as the situation of descriptive set theory under @xmath1 in comparison with that under projective determinacy . as a result ,",
    "the constructible universe becomes a pathological land of counterexamples .",
    "that is bad news , but it could be overlooked , in my opinion , were it not for the much worse related news that @xmath1 is inconsistent with all the strongest large cardinal axioms .",
    "the boundary between those large cardinals that can exist in @xmath2 and those that can not is the threshold of set - theoretic strength , the entryway to the upper realm of infinity .",
    "since the @xmath1 hypothesis is inconsistent with the largest large cardinals , it blocks access to that realm , and this is perceived as intolerably limiting .",
    "this incompatibility , i believe , rather than any issue of definabilism or descriptive set - theoretic consequentialism , is the source of the most strident end - of - the - line deal - breaking objections to the axiom of constructibility .",
    "set theorists simply can not accept an axiom that prevents access to their best and strongest theories , the large cardinal hypotheses , which encapsulate their dreams of what our set theory can achieve and express .",
    "maddy @xcite articulates the grounds that mathematicians often use in reaching this conclusion , mentioning especially the _ maximize _ maxim , saying `` the view that @xmath1 contradicts _ maximize _ is widespread , '' citing drake , moschovakis and scott .",
    "steel argues that `` @xmath1 is restrictive , in that adopting it limits the interpretative power of our language . ''",
    "he points out that the large cardinal set theorist can still understand the @xmath1 believer by means of the translation @xmath3 , but `` there is no translation in the other direction '' and that `` adding @xmath1  just prevents us from asking as many questions ! '' @xcite . at bottom , the axiom of constructibility appears to be incompatible with strength in our set theory , and since we would like to study this strength , we reject the axiom .",
    "let me refer to this general line of reasoning as the _ @xmath0 via maximize _ argument .",
    "the thesis of this article is that the @xmath0 via maximize argument relies on a singularist as opposed to pluralist stand on the question whether there is an absolute background concept of ordinal , that is , whether the ordinals can be viewed as forming a unique completed totality .",
    "the argument , therefore , implicitly takes sides in the universe versus multiverse debate , and i shall argue that without that stand , the @xmath0 via maximize argument lacks force .    in @xcite",
    ", maddy gives the @xmath0 via maximize argument sturdier legs , fleshing out a more detailed mathematical account of it , based on a methodology of mathematical naturalism and using the idea that maximization involves realizing more isomorphism types .",

    "my thesis in this article is that the general line of the @xmath0 via maximize argument presumes that we have an absolute background concept of ordinal , that the ordinals build up to form an absolute completed totality .",
    "of course , many set - theorists do take that stand , particularly set theorists in the california school .",
    "the view that the ordinals form an absolute completed totality follows , of course , from the closely related view that there is a unique absolute background concept of set , by which the sets accumulate to form the entire set - theoretic universe @xmath7 , in which every set - theoretic assertion has a definitive final truth value .",
    "martin essentially argues for the equivalence of these two commitments in his categoricity argument @xcite , where he argues for the uniqueness of the set - theoretic universe , an argument that is a modern - day version of zermelo s categoricity argument with strong parallels in isaacson s @xcite .",
    "martin s argument is founded on the idea of an absolute unending well - ordered sequence of set - formation stages , an ` absolute infinity ' as with cantor .",
    "although martin admits that ` it is of course possible to have doubts about the sharpness of the concept of wellordering,' @xcite , his argument presumes that the concept is sharp , just as i claim the @xmath0 via maximize argument does .",
    "let me briefly summarize the position i am defending in this article , which i shall describe more fully section in [ section.upwardlyextensibleconceptofset ] . on the upwardly extensible concept of set , one holds that any given concept of set or set - theoretic universe may always be extended to a much better one , with more sets and larger ordinals . perhaps the original universe even becomes a mere countable set in the extended universe .",
    "the ` class of all ordinals ' , on this view , makes sense only relative to a particular set - theoretic universe , for there is no expectation that these extensions cohere or converge .",
    "this multiverse perspective resonates with or even follows from a higher - order version of the maximize principle , where we maximize not merely which sets exist , but also which set - theoretic universes exist . specifically , it would be limiting for one set - theoretic universe to have all the ordinals , when we can imagine another universe looking upon it as countable .",
    "maximize thereby leads us to expect that every set - theoretic universe should not only have extensions , but extremely rich extensions , satisfying extremely strong theories , with a full range of large cardinals .",
    "meanwhile , i shall argue , the mathematical results of section [ section.v = lcompatiblewithstrength ] lead naturally to the additional conclusion that every set - theoretic universe should also have extensions satisfying @xmath1 . in particular ,",
    "even if we have very strong large cardinal axioms in our current set - theoretic universe @xmath7 , there is a much larger universe @xmath8 in which the former universe @xmath7 is a countable transitive set and the axiom of constructibility holds .",
    "this perspective , by accommodating both large cardinals and @xmath1 in the multiverse , appears to dissolve the principal thrust of the @xmath0 via maximize argument .",
    "the idea that @xmath1 is permanently incompatible with large cardinals evaporates when we can have large cardinals and reattain @xmath1 in a larger domain . in this way ,",
    "@xmath1 no longer seems restrictive , and the upward extensible concept of set reveals how large cardinals and other strong theories , as well as @xmath1 , may all be pervasive as one moves up in the multiverse .",
    "although my main argument is concerned only with the general line of the @xmath0 via maximize position , rather than with maddy s much more specific account of it in @xcite , before continuing with my main agument i would nevertheless like to mention a few problems with that specific proposal .    to quickly summarize the details , she defines that a theory @xmath9 _",
    "_ shows @xmath10 is an inner model if @xmath9 proves that @xmath10 defines a transitive class satisfying every instance of an axiom of zfc , and either @xmath9 proves every ordinal is in the class , or @xmath9 proves that there is an inaccessible cardinal @xmath11 , such that every ordinal less than @xmath11 is in the class .",
    "next , @xmath10 is a _ _ fair interpretation of @xmath9 in @xmath12 , where @xmath9 extends zfc , if @xmath12 shows @xmath10 is an inner model and @xmath12 proves every axiom of @xmath9 for this inner model .",
    "a theory @xmath12 _ _ maximizes over @xmath9 , if there is a fair interpretation @xmath10 of @xmath9 in @xmath12 , and @xmath12 proves that this inner model is not everything ( let s assume @xmath12 includes zfc ) .",
    "the theory @xmath12 _ _ properly maximizes over @xmath9 if it maximizes over @xmath9 , but not conversely .",
    "the theory @xmath12 _ _ strongly maximizes over @xmath9 if the theories contradict one another , @xmath12 maximizes over @xmath9 and no consistent extension @xmath13 of @xmath9 properly maximizes over @xmath12 .",
    "all of this culminates in her final proposal , which is to say that a theory @xmath9 is _ _ restrictive if and only if there is a consistent theory @xmath12 that strongly maximizes over it .",
    "let me begin with a quibble concerning the syntactic form of her definition of ` shows @xmath10 is an inner model ' , which in effect requires @xmath9 to settle the question of whether the inner model is to contain all ordinals or instead merely all ordinals up to an inaccessible cardinal .",
    "that is , she requires that either @xmath9 proves that @xmath10 is in the first case or that @xmath9 proves that @xmath10 is in the second case , rather than the weaker requirement that @xmath9 prove merely that @xmath10 is in one of the two cases ( so the distinction is between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) . to illustrate how this distinction plays out in her proposal ,",
    "consider the theory @xmath16`there are unboundedly many inaccessible cardinals ' and the theory @xmath17`either there is a mahlo cardinal or there are unboundedly many inaccessible cardinals in @xmath2 . '",
    "( i shall assume without further remark that these large cardinal theories and the others i mention are consistent . ) every model of @xmath9 has an inner model of inacc , either by truncating at the mahlo cardinal , if there is one , or by going to @xmath2 , if there is nt .",
    "thus , we seem to have inner models of the form maddy desires . unfortunately , however , this is not good enough , and i claim that inacc  is actually _ not _ fairly interpreted in @xmath9 . to see this ,",
    "notice first that @xmath9 does not prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal , since we can force over any model of inacc  by destroying all inaccessible cardinals and thereby produce a model of @xmath9 having no inaccessible cardinals .",
    "is not mahlo ' by adding a closed unbounded class @xmath18 of non - inaccessible cardinals  this forcing adds no new sets  and then perform easton forcing to ensure @xmath19 whenever @xmath20 is regular and @xmath21 is the next element of @xmath18 . ] consequently , if @xmath9 shows @xmath10 is an inner model , it can not be because of the second clause , which requires @xmath9 to prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal .",
    "thus , @xmath9 must prove @xmath10 holds of all ordinals .",
    "but notice also that @xmath9 does not prove that there are unboundedly many inaccessible cardinals in @xmath2 , since by truncation we can easily have a mahlo cardinal in @xmath2 with no inaccessible cardinals above it .",
    "so @xmath9 also can not prove that @xmath10 defines a proper class model of inacc .",
    "thus , inacc  is not fairly interpreted in @xmath9 , even though we might have wished it to be .",
    "this issue can be addressed , of course , by modifying the definition of shows - an - inner - model to subsume the disjunction under the provability sign , that is , by requiring instead that @xmath9 prove the disjunction that either @xmath10 holds of all ordinals or that it holds of all ordinals up to an inaccessible cardinal .",
    "but let me leave this issue ; it does not affect my later comments .",
    "my next objection is that the fairly - interpreted - in relation is not transitive , whereas our pre - reflective ideas for an interpreted - in relation would call for it to be transitive .",
    "that is , i claim that it can happen that a first theory has a fair interpretation in a second , which has a fair interpretation in a third , but the first theory has no fair interpretation in the third .",
    "here is a specific example showing the lack of transitivity : @xmath22 the reader may easily verify that @xmath23 has a fair interpretation in @xmath24 by truncating the universe at the first inaccessible cardinal , and @xmath24 has a fair interpretation in @xmath9 by going to @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , every model of @xmath24 has forcing extensions satisfying @xmath9 , by the lvy  collapse .",
    "meanwhile , i claim that @xmath23 has no fair interpretation in @xmath9 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath9 is consistent with the lack of inaccessible cardinals , and so if @xmath9 shows @xmath10 is an inner model , then in any model of @xmath9 having no inaccessible cardinals , this inner model must contain all the ordinals . in this case , in order for it to have @xmath25 , the inner model must be all of @xmath2 , which according to @xmath9 has an inaccessible cardinal , and therefore does nt satisfy @xmath23 after all .",
    "so @xmath23 is not fairly interpreted in @xmath9 .",
    "the reader may construct many similar examples of intransitivity .",
    "the essence here is that the first theory is fairly interpreted in the second only by truncating , and the second is fairly interpreted in the third only by going to an inner model containing all the ordinals , but there is no way to interpret the first in the third except by doing both , which is not allowed in the definition if the truncation point is inaccessible only in the inner model and not in the larger universe .",
    "the same example shows that the maximizing - over relation also is not transitive , since @xmath9 maximizes over @xmath24 and @xmath24 maximizes over @xmath23 , by the fair interpretations mentioned above ( note that these theories are mutually exclusive ) , but @xmath9 does not maximize over @xmath23 , since @xmath23 has no fair interpretation in @xmath9 . similarly , the reader may verify that the example shows that the properly - maximizes - over and the strongly - maximizes - over relations also are not transitive .",
    "let me turn now to give a few additional examples of what maddy calls a ` false positive , ' a theory deemed formally restrictive , which we do not find intuitively to be restrictive . as i see it , the main purpose of @xcite is to give precise mathematical substance to the intuitive idea that some set theories seem restrictive in a way that others do not .",
    "we view @xmath1 and ` there is a largest inaccessible cardinal ' as limiting , while ` there are unboundedly many inaccessible cardinals ' seems open - ended and unrestrictive .",
    "maddy presents some false positives , including an example of steel s showing that @xmath26`there is a measurable cardinal ' is restrictive because it is strongly maximized by the theory @xmath27\\not{\\models}{{\\sf zfc}}$ ] .",
    "lwe points out that `` this example can be generalized to at least every interesting theory in large cardinal form extending zfc .",
    "thus , most theories are restrictive in a formal sense , '' @xcite and he shows in @xcite that zfc  itself is formally restrictive because it is maximized by the theory @xmath28`every uncountable cardinal is singular ' .",
    "i would like to present examples of a different type , which involve what i believe to be more attractive maximizing theories that seem to avoid the counterarguments that have been made to the previous examples of false positives .",
    "first , consider again the theory inacc , asserting @xmath26`there are unboundedly many inaccessible cardinals ' , a theory maddy wants to regard as not restrictive .",
    "let @xmath9 be the theory asserting @xmath26`there are unboundedly many inaccessible cardinals in @xmath2 , but no worldly cardinals in @xmath7 . '",
    "a cardinal @xmath11 is _ _ worldly when @xmath29 .",
    "worldliness is a weakening of inaccessibility , since every inaccessible cardinal is worldly and in fact a limit of worldly cardinals ; but meanwhile , worldly cardinals need not be regular , and the regular worldly cardinals are exactly the inaccessible cardinals .",
    "the worldly cardinals often serve as a substitute for inaccessible cardinals , allowing one to weaken the large cardinal commitment of a hypothesis .",
    "for example , one may carry out most uses of the grothendieck universe axiom in category theory by using mere worldly cardinals in place of inaccessible cardinals .",
    "the theory @xmath9 is equiconsistent with inacc , since every model of inacc  has a class forcing extension of @xmath9 . of cardinals containing no worldly cardinals ( this forcing adds no new sets ) , and then performs easton forcing so as to ensure that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is regular and @xmath21 is the next element of @xmath18 .",
    "the result is a model of @xmath9 , since all worldly cardinals have been killed off . ]",
    "the theory inacc  has a fair interpretation in @xmath9 , by going to @xmath2 , and as a result , @xmath9 maximizes over inacc .",
    "meanwhile , i claim that no strengthening of inacc  properly maximizes over @xmath9 . to see this ,",
    "suppose that @xmath30 contains inacc  and shows @xmath10 is an inner model @xmath31 satisfying @xmath9 . if @xmath31 contains all the ordinals , then since inacc  proves that the inaccessible cardinals are unbounded , @xmath31 would have to contain all those inaccessible cardinals , which would remain inaccessible in @xmath31 since inaccessibility is downward absolute , and therefore violate the claim of @xmath9 that there are no worldly cardinals .",
    "so by the definition of fair interpretation , therefore , @xmath31 would have to contain all the ordinals up to an inaccessible cardinal @xmath11 .",
    "but in this case , a loweheim - skolem argument shows that there is a closed unbounded set of @xmath32 with @xmath33 , and all such @xmath20 would be worldly cardinals in @xmath31 , violating @xmath9 .",
    "thus , inacc  is strongly maximized by @xmath9 , and so inacc  is restrictive .",
    "let me improve the example to make it more attractive , provided that we read maddy s definition of ` fair interpretation ' in a way that i believe she may have intended .",
    "the issue is that although maddy refers to ` truncation  at inaccessible levels ' and her definition is typically described by others using that phrase , nevertheless the particular way that she wrote her definition does not actually ensure that the truncation occurs at an inaccessible level . specifically , in the truncation case , she writes that @xmath9 should prove that there is an inaccessible cardinal @xmath11 for which @xmath34 .",
    "but should this implication be a biconditional ?",
    "otherwise , of course , nothing prevents @xmath10 from continuing past @xmath11 , and the definition would be more accurately described as ` truncation at , or somewhere above , an inaccessible cardinal ' . if one wants to allow truncation at non - inaccessible cardinals , why should we bother to insist that the height should exceed some inaccessible cardinal ? replacing this implication with a biconditional would indeed ensure that when the inner model arises by truncation , it does so by truncating at an inaccessible cardinal level .",
    "so let us modify the reading of ` fair interpretation ' so that truncation , if it occurs , does so at an inaccessible cardinal level . in this case",
    ", consider the theory inacc  as before , and let @xmath35 be the theory @xmath26`there is a measurable cardinal with no worldly cardinals above it ' . by truncating at a measurable cardinal",
    ", we produce a model of inacc , and so @xmath35 offers a fair interpretation of inacc , and consequently @xmath35 maximizes over inacc . but",
    "no consistent strengthening of inacc  can maximize over @xmath35 , since if @xmath36 and @xmath37 is an inner model of @xmath7 satisfying @xmath35 , then @xmath37 can not contain all the ordinals of @xmath7 , since the inaccessible cardinals would be worldly in @xmath37 , and neither can the height of @xmath37 be inaccessible in @xmath7 , since if @xmath38 is inaccessible in @xmath7 , then by a lowenheim - skolem argument there must be a closed unbounded set of @xmath32 such that @xmath39 , and this will cause unboundedly many worldly cardinals in @xmath37 , contrary to @xmath35 .",
    "thus , on the modified definition of fair interpretation , we conclude that @xmath35 strongly maximizes over inacc , and so inacc  is restricted .",
    "one may construct similar examples using the theory @xmath26`there is a proper class of measurable cardinals ' , which is strongly maximized by @xmath40`there is a supercompact cardinal with no worldly cardinals above it ' .",
    "truncating at the supercompact cardinal produces a model of the former theory , but no strengthening of the former theory can show @xmath41 in an inner model , since the unboundedly many measurable cardinals of the former theory prevent the showing of any proper class model of @xmath41 , and the eventual lack of worldly cardinals in @xmath41 prevents it from being shown in any truncation at an inaccessible level of any model of zfc .",
    "a general format for these examples would be @xmath26`there is a proper class of large cardinals of type lc ' and @xmath17`there is an inaccessible limit of lc  cardinals , with no worldly cardinals above . '",
    "such examples work for any large cardinal notion lc  that implies worldliness , is absolute to truncations at inaccessible levels and is consistent with a lack of worldly cardinals above .",
    "almost all ( but not all ) of the standard large cardinal notions have these features .",
    "maddy has rejected some of the false positives on the grounds that the strongly maximizing theory involved is a ` dud ' theory , such as @xmath42 .",
    "are the theories above , @xmath35 and @xmath41 , duds in this sense ?",
    "it seems hard to argue that they are . for various reasons ,",
    "set theorists often consider models of set theory with largest instances of large cardinals and no large cardinals above , often obtaining such models by truncation , in order to facilitate certain constructions .",
    "indeed , the idea of truncating the universe at an inaccessible cardinal level lies at the heart of maddy s definitions . but",
    "much of the value of that idea is already obtained when one truncates at the worldly cardinals instead .",
    "the theory @xmath35 can be obtained from any model of measurable cardinal by truncating at the least worldly cardinal above it , if there is one .",
    "but moreover , one need nt truncate at all : one can force @xmath35 over any model with a measurable cardinal , by very mild forcing .",
    "first , add a closed unbounded class @xmath18 of cardinals containing no worldly cardinal , and then perform easton forcing so as to ensure in the forcing extension that @xmath19 , whenever @xmath20 is regular and @xmath21 is the next element of @xmath18 above @xmath20 .",
    "the point is that this forcing will ensure that the continuum function @xmath43 jumps over the former worldly cardinals , and so they will no longer be worldly ( and no new worldly cardinals are created ) .",
    "if one starts this forcing above a measurable cardinal @xmath11 , then one preserves that measurable cardinal while killing all the worldly cardinals above it .",
    "( in the case of @xmath41 , one should first make the supercompact cardinal laver indestructible . ) because we can obtain @xmath35 and @xmath41 by moving from a large cardinal model to a forcing extension , where all the previous context and strength seems still available , these theories do not seem to be duds in any obvious way",
    ". nevertheless , the theories @xmath35 and @xmath41 are restrictive , of course , in the intuitive sense that maddy s project is concerned with . but to object that these theories are duds on the grounds that they are restrictive would be to give up the entire project ; the point was to give precise substance to our notion of ` restrictive ' , and it would beg the question to define that a theory is restrictive if it is strongly maximized by a theory that is not ` restrictive . '      in order to support my main thesis , i would like next to survey a series of mathematical results , most of them a part of set - theoretic folklore , which reveal various senses in which the axiom of constructibility @xmath1 is compatible with strength in set theory , particularly if one has in mind the possibility of moving from one universe of set theory to a much larger one .    first , there is the easy observation , expressed in observation [ observation.vandlagreeonconsistency ] , that @xmath2 and @xmath7 satisfy the same consistency assertions . for any constructible theory @xmath9 in any language  and by a ` constructible ' theory i mean just that @xmath44 , which is true of any c.e .  theory , such as zfc  plus any of the usual large cardinal hypotheses  the constructible universe @xmath2 and @xmath7 agree on the consistency of @xmath9 because they have exactly the same proofs from @xmath9 .",
    "it follows from this , by the completeness theorem , that they also have models of exactly the same constructible theories .",
    "what this easy fact shows , therefore , is that while asserting @xmath1 we may continue to make all the same consistency assertions , such as @xmath45 , with exactly the same confidence that we might hope to do so in @xmath7 , and we correspondingly find models of our favorite strong theories inside @xmath2 .",
    "perhaps a skeptic worries that those models in @xmath2 are somehow defective ?",
    "perhaps we find only ill - founded models of our strong theory in @xmath2 ?",
    "not at all , in light of the following theorem , a fact that i found eye - opening when i first came to know it years ago .",
    "the assertion that a given theory @xmath9 has a transitive model has complexity @xmath46 , in the form `` there is a real coding a well founded structure satisfying @xmath9 , '' and so it is absolute between @xmath2 and @xmath7 by the shoenfield absoluteness theorem , provided the theory itself is in @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , one can have transitive models of extremely strong large cardinal theories without ever leaving @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if there is a transitive model of the theory @xmath26``there is a proper class of woodin cardinals , '' then there is such a transitive model inside @xmath2 .",
    "the theorem has the following interesting consequence .",
    "[ corollary.landvsamesigma_1theory](levy-shoenfield absoluteness theorem ) in particular , @xmath2 and @xmath7 satisfy the same @xmath47 sentences , with parameters hereditarily countable in @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , @xmath48 and @xmath7 satisfy the same such sentences .",
    "since @xmath2 is a transitive class , it follows that @xmath2 is a @xmath49-elementary substructure of @xmath7 , and so @xmath47 truth easily goes upward from @xmath2 to @xmath7 .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath7 satisfies @xmath50 , where @xmath10 is @xmath49 and @xmath51 is hereditarily countable in @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath7 has a transitive model of the theory @xmath52 , together with the atomic diagram of the transitive closure @xmath51 and a bijection of it to @xmath53 . by observation [ observation.vandlagreeonconsistency ]",
    ", it follows that @xmath2 has such a model as well .",
    "but a transitive model of this theory in @xmath2 implies that there really is an @xmath54 with @xmath55 , as desired .",
    "since the witness is countable in @xmath2 , we find the witness in @xmath48 .",
    "one may conversely supply a direct proof of corollary [ corollary.landvsamesigma_1theory ] via the shoenfield absoluteness theorem and then view theorem [ theorem.vandlhavesametransitivemodels ] as the consequence , because the assertion that there is a transitive model of a given theory in @xmath2 is @xmath47 assertion about that theory .",

    "the observation that we gain genuine set - theoretic insights when working merely over countable transitive models is reinforced by the fact that the move to countable transitive models is or at least was , for many set theorists , a traditional part of the official procedure by which the forcing technique was formalized .",
    "( perhaps a more common contemporary view is that this is an unnecessary pedagogical simplification , for one can formalize forcing over @xmath7 internally as a zfc  construction . )",
    "another supporting example is provided by the inner model hypothesis of @xcite , a maximality - type principle whose very formalization seems to require one to think of the universe as a toy model , for the axiom is stated about @xmath7 as it exists as a countable transitive model in a larger universe . in short , much of what we hope to achieve with our strong set theories",
    "is already achieved merely by having transitive models of those theories , and theorem [ theorem.vandlhavesametransitivemodels ] shows that the existence of any and all such kind of transitive models is fully and equally consistent with our retaining @xmath1 .",
    "because of this , the @xmath0 via maximize argument begins to lose its force .",
    "nearly every set theorist entertaining some strong set - theoretic hypothesis @xmath127 is generally also willing to entertain the hypothesis that @xmath128 holds in a transitive model . to be sure , the move from a hypothesis @xmath127 to the assertion ` there is a transitive model of @xmath128 ' is strictly increasing in consistency strength , a definite step up , but a small step .",
    "just as philosophical logicians have often discussed the general principle that if you are willing to assert a theory @xmath9 , then you are also or should also be willing to assert that ` @xmath9 is consistent , ' in set theory we have the similar principle , that if you are willing to assert @xmath9 , then you are or should be willing to assert that ` there is a transitive model of @xmath9 ' .",
    "what is more , such a principle amounts essentially to the mathematical content of the philosophical reflection arguments , such as in @xcite , that are often used to justify large cardinal axioms . as a result ,",
    "one has a kind of translation that maps any strong set - theoretic hypothesis @xmath127 to an assertion ` there is a transitive model of @xmath128 ' , which has the same explanatory force in terms of describing the range of set - theoretic possibility , but which because of the theorems of section [ section.v = lcompatiblewithstrength ] remains compatible with @xmath1 .",
    "this perspective appears to rebut steel s claims , mentioned in the opening section of this article , that `` there is no translation '' from the large cardinal realm to the @xmath1 context and that `` adding @xmath1 ... prevents us from asking as many questions . ''",
    "namely , the believer in @xmath1 seems fully able to converse meaningfully with any large cardinal set theorist , simply by imagining that the large cardinal set theorist is currently living inside a countable transitive model . by applying the translation",
    "@xmath129 the @xmath1 believer steps up in strength above the large cardinal set theorist , while retaining @xmath1 and while remaining fully able to analyze and carry out the large cardinal set theorist s arguments and constructions inside that transitive model . furthermore",
    ", if the large cardinal set theorist believes in her axiom because of the philosophical reflection principle arguments , then she agrees that set - theoretic truth is ultimately captured inside transitive sets , and so ultimately she agrees with the step up that the @xmath1 believer made , to put the large cardinal theory inside a transitive set .",
    "this simply reinforces the accuracy with which the @xmath1 believer has captured the situation .",
    "although the translation i am discussing is not a ` fair interpretation ' in the technical sense of @xcite , as discussed in section [ section.criticismofmaddy ] , nevertheless it does seem to me to be a fair interpretation in a sense that matters , because it allows the @xmath1 believer to understand and appreciate the large cardinal set theorist s arguments and constructions .",
    "let me now go a bit further .",
    "my claim is that on the multiverse view as i describe it in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the nature of the full outer multiverse of @xmath7 is revealed in part by the toy simulacrum of it that we find amongst the countable models of set theory . for all we know , our current set - theoretic universe @xmath7 is merely a countable transitive set inside another much larger universe @xmath8 , which looks upon @xmath7 as a mere toy .",
    "and so when we can prove that a certain behavior is pervasive in the toy multiverse of any model of set theory , then we should expect to find this behavior also in the toy multiverse of @xmath8 , which includes a meaningfully large part of the actual multiverse of @xmath7 . in this way",
    ", we come to learn about the full multiverse of @xmath7 by undertaking a general study of the toy model multiverses .",
    "just as every countable model has actual forcing extensions , we expect our full universe to have actual forcing extensions ; just as every countable model can be end - extended to a model of @xmath1 , we expect the full universe @xmath7 can be end - extended to a universe in which @xmath1 holds ; and so on .",
    "how fortunate it is that the study of the connections between the countable models of set theory is a purely mathematical activity that can be carried out within our theory .",
    "this mathematical knowledge , such as the results mentioned in section [ section.v = lcompatiblewithstrength ] or the results of @xcite , which show that the multiverse axioms of @xcite are true amongst the countable computably - saturated models of set theory , in turn supports philosophical conclusions about the nature of the full set - theoretic multiverse .",
    "the principle that pervasive features of the toy multiverses are evidence for the truth of those features in the full multiverse is a reflection principle similar in kind to those that are often used to provide philosophical justification for large cardinals .",
    "just as those reflection principles regard the full universe @xmath7 as fundamentally inaccessible , yet reflected in various much smaller pieces of the universe , the principle here regards the full multiverse as fundamentally inaccessible , yet appearing in part locally as a toy multiverse within a given universe .",
    "so our knowledge of what happens in the toy multiverses becomes evidence of what the full multiverse may be like .",
    "ultimately , the multiverse vision entails an upwardly extensible concept of set , where any current set - theoretic universe may be extended to a much larger , taller universe .",
    "the current universe becomes a countable model inside a larger universe , which has still larger extensions , some with large cardinals , some without , some with the continuum hypothesis , some without , some with @xmath1 and some without , in a series of further extensions continuing longer than we can imagine .",
