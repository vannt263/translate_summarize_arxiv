    "the four nucleon ( 4n ) system represents a qualitative jump in complexity relative to the @xmath1 case , as has been put forward in several papers  @xcite .",
    "it becomes already obvious when comparing the experimental @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 cross sections displayed in fig .",
    "( [ diff_234n ] ) ; the smooth behaviour of @xmath4 and @xmath1 curves contrasts with the non trivial structure manifested in @xmath5 .",
    "this structure , in the energy region around e@xmath63 mev , is commonly associated with negative parity , isospin @xmath7 resonance states @xcite .",
    "actually , @xmath5 is the smallest nuclear system which exhibit characteristic nuclear properties  such as saturation in the binding energy  and in which the simplest nuclear ( @xmath8 ) and fusion ( @xmath9 ) reactions take place .",
    "moreover , many reactions involving four nucleons , like @xmath10 ( the @xmath11 process ) , are of extreme astrophysical interest , as they play important roles in solar models and big - bang nucleosynthesis ; the @xmath11 process , for instance , is the source of the highest energy neutrinos from the sun .",
    "= 12.0 cm    the study of the 4n system is particularly interesting as a  theoretical laboratory \" to test new models of the nuclear force . unlike the @xmath1 systems",
    ", @xmath5 shows a delicate and rich structure of excited states in the continuum  @xcite whose position and width depends critically on the underlying nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the effect of ( i ) the nn p - wave and of ( ii ) the three - nucleon ( 3n ) force are believed to be larger than in the @xmath4 or @xmath12 systems .",
    "moreover , it is the simplest system where the 3n interaction in the channels of total isospin @xmath13 can be studied .",
    "therefore it is of the utmost importance to have reliable few - body techniques powerful enough to deal with this system . ever increasing computer power , development of novel numerical methods , and significant refinements of well - established techniques",
    "have come together to show that the solution of the four - nucleon bound state problem with realistic hamiltonians is reliable .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the binding energies and other properties of the @xmath14-particle were studied using the av8@xmath15  @xcite nn interaction ; several different techniques @xcite produce results in very close agreement with each other ( at the level of less than 1% ) .",
    "more recently the faddeev  yakubovsky ( fy ) equations  @xcite were solved for different realistic nn + 3n force models .",
    "these calculations are fully converged in terms of nn partial waves and the results agree with identical works using the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc )  @xcite or hypherspherical harmonics ( hh ) methods  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of solving the @xmath16 scattering problem with realistic hamiltonians .",
    "as discussed before , the @xmath5 system is very rich and several elastic and rearrangement channels are indeed possible already at low energy , depending on the total charge ( @xmath0 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . among them ,",
    "the @xmath0 is the simplest one : free from coulomb interaction and , to a very good approximation , a pure isospin @xmath7 state .",
    "however , it presents a rich dynamics since a resonance structure is visible at center of mass energy @xmath19 mev , as already shown in fig .",
    "( [ diff_234n ] ) .    up to now only two of the techniques used in bound state calculations ( fy and hh ) as well as methods based on the resonating group model ( rgm )  @xcite and on the solution of alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags ) equations  @xcite have been employed to attack this problem with realistic hamiltonians ( for a review of earlier results , see ref .",
    "some previous fy calculations in configuration space suggested that realistic nn interactions could fail in reproducing the experimental total and differential cross sections  @xcite .",
    "these calculations were however limited to a relatively small number of partial waves in the expansion of fy amplitudes , thereby such lack of convergence could be advocated to explain the failure . using ags equations , the author of ref .",
    "@xcite was able to substantially increase the number of partial wave amplitudes and obtain a fairly good agreement for the total cross section at the resonance peak . however , these calculations were based on a rank - one separable expansion of the 2-body t - matrix , which also raises some doubts on the reliability of the results .",
    "the calculations performed by expanding the scattering wave functions on the correlated hyperspherical harmonic ( chh ) basis were able to obtain a reasonable estimate of the various phase - shift and mixing - angle parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of convergence could not be solved completely due to numerical difficulties when adding more chh components .",
    "for this reason , a new expansion on the ( uncorrelated ) hh basis is considered here .    the results obtained using these techniques were so far at rather large variance between each other .",
    "clearly , this situation should be clarified before questioning the ability of present nn + 3n force models to describe the experimental data beyond the binding energy of @xmath20he , for which they have proven to be rather successful  @xcite .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper in which we compare low energy @xmath0 scattering results obtained by three different groups , using independent methods to solve the four - body equations .",
    "they concern ags calculations  @xcite based on rank - one expansion of the nn t - matrix , variational solutions of the schrdinger equation using hh method  @xcite and the solutions of fy equations  @xcite with a substantial improvement in the number of partial waves  @xcite ; av18  @xcite and nijm - ii  @xcite nn interaction models are used in present calculations .",
    "we have considered the center of mass energies @xmath21 mev .",
    "they constitute a good set of data for interpolating other values of the phase shifts and allow to determine the low energy parameters ( scattering length and effective range ) .",
    "in addition , values @xmath22 mev correspond to the measured differential cross sections .    to describe scattering solutions , we will expand the different @xmath23 @xmath0 states in terms of the asymptotic hamiltonian channels @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the @xmath0 relative orbital angular momentum and @xmath26 the total spin .",
    "the following @xmath23 states will be considered : @xmath27 are fixed by the dynamics and make the solutions eigenstates of the s - matrix .    as it will be demonstrated later , these states are the only relevant ones for the low energy scattering considered here . moreover , the coupling @xmath28 is very weak and is neglected for @xmath29 state .",
    "we briefly describe the methods used for solving the 4n problem .",
    "two of them ( fy and hh ) work in configuration space while ags in momentum space .",
    "the starting point involves the ags equations  @xcite for the transition operators involving all ( 2n)+(2n ) and n+(3n ) channels . for local nn potentials such equations are three - vector variable integral equations which after partial wave decomposition reduce to a set of coupled equations in three continuous scalar variables .",
    "since scattering calculations require a great number of channels for convergence , we follow an approach based on the separable representation of subsystem amplitudes in order to reduce the equations to two or one continuous variable .",
    "the integral equations we use are the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite and result from the modified ags equations  @xcite after one has : ( a ) represented the original nn t - matrix by an operator of rank one ; ( b ) represented the resulting 3n t - matrix by a finite rank operator and taken as many terms as needed for convergence . since in the modified ags equations the 2n+2n subamplitudes are expressed in terms of a convolution integral involving two non - interacting pair - propagators , as first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sole approximation in this approach involves a rank one representation of the 2n t - matrix which may be obtained from the well - known method of ernst , shakin , and thaler ( est )  @xcite .",
    "the multi - term representation of the 3n t - matrix is done using the energy dependent pole expansion ( edpe ) method developed in ref .",
    "this latter representation for the 3n t - matrix is well under control since one may check the convergence rate of 4n observables for increasing rank in the 3n t - matrix .",
    "this method was first used in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the binding energy of @xmath20he and later confirmed to be accurate by the exact work of kamada and glckle  @xcite .",
    "more recently  @xcite the results of our calculations for @xmath0 elastic scattering were shown to agree with the exact results of the grenoble group  @xcite , for both malfliet - tjon ( mt ) and av14 potentials taken in 2n partial waves with total angular momentum j @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . in the present calculations we extend the work in ref .",
    "@xcite by increasing the number of 2n partial waves to @xmath32 .",

    "@xcite and it will not be repeated here . a large number of equation can be quite easily be solved .",
    "let us now discuss briefly the choice of the hh states to be included in the expansion .",
    "as for the @xmath14-particle bound state  @xcite , the `` brute force '' inclusion of hh states is not possible and one has to select the appropriate subset of functions .",
    "we have found convenient  @xcite to separate the hh functions in classes depending on the value of @xmath147 : channels with low values as possible of @xmath148 have to be included in the expansion first .",
    "for each group of channels of a given @xmath148 , the corresponding values of @xmath149 are increased until convergence is reached .",
    "then , channels with a larger value of @xmath148 are included in the expansion and so on .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that the classes of channels with large values of @xmath148 have small contributions .",
    "consequently , the corresponding values of @xmath149 can be also taken smaller and smaller .",
    "an example of convergence is presented in table  [ conv_delta_fy ] , in the last three columns . there , the phase shifts at @xmath150 mev obtained by including in the hh expansion the channels with increasing values of @xmath148 have been reported . for s - wave phase shifts ,",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath151 channels is sufficient to have already rather good estimates .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath152 channels is found to be negligible . for the p - wave phase shifts , the channels with @xmath153",
    "give the dominant contribution at low energies ( @xmath154 mev ) , but in the peak region they are clearly insufficient to obtain good estimates . including the channels with @xmath155 , the hh predictions already differ less of 4% with respect to the final fy results .",
    "there exist a very large number of @xmath156 channels and we have limited ourselves to the inclusion of those ( usually ) most important , namely , those having @xmath157 and @xmath158 , plus permutations ( this is sufficient to double the number of channels ) .",
    "however , the changes of the p - wave phase shifts are rather tiny .",
    "therefore , we expect that the contribution of the disregarded channels @xmath156 ( and those with @xmath159 ) to be practically negligible .",
    "this issue is currently being investigated  @xcite .",
    "it must be noticed that in the present hh calculation only states constructed in terms of the jacobi vectors of the set k have been considered ( hereafter referred to set - k hh functions ) .",
    "obviously , the hh functions of a given set of jacobi vectors form a complete basis by themselves .",
    "however , the hh functions constructed with the set h of jacobi vectors ( set - h hh functions ) should be more suitable for taking into account contributions from the @xmath160 cluster structures .",
    "it is rather obvious that the inclusion of hh functions of both sets should speed up the convergence in constructing the state of the system . in the present calculation , however , we have included only the set - k hh functions since we were able to include a number of states sufficient to reach , in the studied cases , a satisfactory degree of convergence .",

    "in this work we have presented the low energy @xmath0 elastic cross sections calculated by solving the 4-nucleon problem with realistic nn interactions and by using three different approaches .",
    "the results of hyperspherical harmonics and faddeev - yakubovsky methods are converged to 1% accuracy and are in close agreement with each other .",
    "av18 and nijm - ii nucleon - nucleon potentials underestimate the experimental cross section by 10% near the resonance peak .",
    "this disagreement is not corrected by uix three - nucleon forces , whose effect in this energy region is small and tends to further decrease the theoretical value upto 15%  @xcite .",
    "the results of ags equations are closer to the experimental data .",
    "however they have been obtained using a rank - one approximation to the two - body t - matrix .",
    "this approximation , which was found to provide excellent results for nuclear systems dominated by s - waves ( 3n problem or positive parity 4n states ) , seems to provide an excess of attraction in the negative parity states of @xmath0 system , where p - waves turn out to be important .",
    "we believe that accurate treatment of these resonant states requires the inclusion of higher rank terms .    the results presented here concern local nn potentials .",
    "however similar conclusions were found in previous works  @xcite using non local ones ( bonn  @xcite and doleschall  @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates a serious difficulty of the existing nn force models in describing the simplest nuclear resonance , i.e. the @xmath0 system .",
    "this difficulty can hardly be solved by the inclusion of a standard type of 3nf , used to reproduce the few - nucleon binding energies .",
    "their origin could rather lie either in the nn forces themselves , or in the presence of 3nf of unknown type .",
