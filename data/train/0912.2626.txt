    "let us next analyze a second parameter set , where we will encounter a nontrivial double - well behavior for the effective oscillator potential @xmath177 .",
    "the transition from single- to double - well behavior is here induced by a variation of the phase difference @xmath0 , and one may therefore affect the conformational state of the molecule in a dissipationless manner in such a setup .",
    "the parameter set is given by @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , with electron - vibration coupling strength @xmath252 .",
    "moreover , the temperature has been set to @xmath253 . as illustrated in fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] , we indeed find a transition between a single- and a double - well potential induced by a variation of @xmath0 .",
    "similar transitions ( with associated bistabilities ) were reported for a two - level system instead of the oscillator,@xcite and for the nonequilibrium normal - state local holstein model.@xcite    although the continuum contribution to the electron force and thus to the effective potential @xmath177 still plays an overall dominant role , it is almost insensitive to variations of @xmath0 . the @xmath0-tunable transition to a double - well potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is therefore caused by andreev level contributions to @xmath235 .",
    "we note that the shape of @xmath177 is also sensitive to temperature through thermal occupation factors of the andreev levels .",
    "the dynamical frequency @xmath254 for the oscillator motion in the effective potential @xmath177 can be strongly renormalized away from the bare oscillator frequency @xmath13 . for the parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we typically find @xmath255 .",
    "the @xmath14-dependence of the andreev level spectrum @xmath256 in the adiabatic limit , i.e. , with instantaneous @xmath113 , is shown for several phases",
    "@xmath0 in the inset of fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "note that this spectrum is rather different from the featureless andreev level spectrum for the first parameter set , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the current - phase relation for this parameter set .",
    "the josephson current again exhibits an overall suppression due to the electron - vibration coupling as reported previously.@xcite the suppression is now more pronounced than in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but still remains moderate .",
    "moreover , the current - phase relation exhibits small yet characteristic cusps in the crossover region between the single- and double - well situation ( @xmath257 to @xmath258 ) , where andreev level noise @xmath259 is strongly enhanced.@xcite however , the effect of switching between the two potential wells does not have a dramatic influence on the current - phase relation because the magnitude of the current is basically the same in each well : the coordinates @xmath260 of two local minima are almost symmetric with respect to @xmath261 .",
    "indeed , we find @xmath262 and hence @xmath263 for strong coupling @xmath16 and small @xmath10 .    figures [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] then show the resulting energy distribution function @xmath227 for the three values of the phase difference @xmath0 considered in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , respectively .",
    "despite of the _ enhanced _ effective temperature @xmath264 as compared to @xmath265 , we find again that @xmath227 strongly deviates from a classical ( boltzmann ) distribution function .",
    "interestingly , for energies @xmath171 below the separatrix region , @xmath227 is well approximated by an effective bose - einstein function .",
    "indeed , we find that for @xmath266 , both @xmath227 and the bose - einstein function @xmath267 obey the same equation . as a result , within this region , we find @xmath268 instead of the boltzmann dependence @xmath269 , implying a much stronger localization of the oscillator s motion near the bottom of the deeper well .",
    "moreover , the damping @xmath183 is determined by both the continuum and andreev level contributions , while the diffusion coefficient @xmath184 is essentially determined by the andreev level contribution .",
    "finally , we address the parameter regime where the described switching from single- to double - well behavior in @xmath177 is found , see fig .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a fixed vibrational frequency , @xmath249 . for given system parameters , when increasing @xmath16 , we find from our numerical scheme that double - well behavior starts to appear at @xmath270 for @xmath271 .",
    "when further increasing @xmath16 , the double - well behavior extends to a region with @xmath272 as well .",
    "a second scale @xmath273 is then defined such that for @xmath274 , the double - well behavior is found for all @xmath0 . in order to determine @xmath275",
    ", it is therefore sufficient to probe for the single - to - double - well transition at the phase differences @xmath271 and @xmath276 .",
    "the transition region between @xmath277 and @xmath278 is in fact rather narrow , cf .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "note that the location of the switching transition is quite sensitive to temperature .",
    "in particular , with increasing @xmath265 , the boundary @xmath275 shifts to bigger @xmath16 values .",
    "we have shown that the adiabatic limit allows to make analytical progress for an important model of molecular electronics , the superconducting local holstein model .",
    "it describes a spinless resonant electronic level coupled to a single boson ( vibration mode ) , where the resonant level is coupled to two superconducting reservoirs with a phase difference @xmath0 .",
    "the adiabatic limit is realized when the oscillator frequency @xmath13 is smaller than both the superconducting gap @xmath3 and the dot - to - lead hybridization energy scale @xmath279 .",
    "this regime allows for a semiclassical born - oppenheimer - type treatment , where the electronic degrees of freedom can be integrated out and give rise to an effective oscillator potential @xmath177 .",
    "moreover , they cause dissipative damping and a stochastic noise force .",
    "the most relevant parameter regime turns out to be the underdamped one , where it is appropriate to consider diffusion in energy space , and the effects of damping @xmath280 $ ] and noise @xmath281 $ ] can be taken into account within a standard fokker - planck scheme .",
    "the resulting distribution function @xmath227 solving the fokker - planck equation can be obtained numerically with moderate effort , and allows us to obtain quantitative results within a controlled approximation for @xmath70 .",
    "the method has been applied to a calculation of the josephson current - phase relation @xmath1 . while the resulting corrections to the josephson current are generally small in magnitude even for strong electron - vibration coupling @xmath16 , they still cause some features when the effective potential @xmath177 changes character . in particular , it is possible to induce a change from a single- to a double - well potential surface by variation of the phase difference @xmath0 . near the transition point , we predict enhanced andreev level noise .",
    "similar transitions from single- to double - well effective potentials were also reported for the normal - state case,@xcite but for a nonequilibrium situation where a finite bias voltage is applied and dissipation is unavoidable . in our equilibrium case ,",
    "the transition is induced by a variation of the superconducting phase and therefore is dissipationless .",
    "however , the effect of switching from one to two minima in @xmath177 on the josephson current @xmath1 is much weaker here , which can be rationalized by noting that the two minima are located symmetrically and the josephson current is essentially identical when the oscillator is close to a given minimum .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the josephson current seems always to be _ suppressed _ by the coupling to the oscillator , independent of the normal - state transmission probability through the junction , i.e. , the interaction correction is negative , in contrast to what happens in the normal state.@xcite this conclusion has also been reached via perturbation theory in the electron - vibration coupling @xmath16 for the josephson current.@xcite    a quantity that is much more sensitive to the existence of two minima in the effective oscillator potential @xmath177 is the phonon distribution function . as we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , in the double - well case , the phonon distribution function has a characteristic two - peak structure and displays strong phonon localization .",
    "it may be possible to access this quantity experimentally via resonant coherent phonon spectroscopy techniques,@xcite and thereby provide clear signatures of the predicted crossover from single- to double - well behavior .",
