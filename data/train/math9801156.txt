    "we shall use seiberg  witten invariants to show that certain smooth structures obstruct the existence of einstein metrics , and refer the reader to  @xcite for the definitions and basic properties of the invariants .",

    ", we assume @xmath6 throughout , though this is not essential .    we shall need the following result concerning the behaviour of the invariants under connected summing with @xmath7 .",
    "this is usually referred to as a blowup formula .",
    "[ p : blowup ] let @xmath8 be a @xmath9structure on @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 a generator of @xmath13",
    ". then @xmath1 has a @xmath9structure @xmath14 with @xmath15 , such that the seiberg  witten invariants of @xmath8 and of @xmath14 are equal ( up to sign ) .",
    "as the reflection in @xmath16 in the cohomology of @xmath1 is realised by a self - diffeomorphism , the naturality of the invariants shows that there is another @xmath9structure with the same seiberg ",
    "witten invariant , up to sign , and with@xmath17 .",
    "using this , we can prove the following version of a theorem of lebrun  @xcite :    [ t : blowup ] let @xmath10 be a manifold with a non - zero seiberg ",
    "witten invariant ( of any degree ) , and @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 , then @xmath1 does not admit an einstein metric .    if @xmath14 has a non - zero seiberg ",
    "witten invariant , then for every riemannian metric @xmath20 there must be a solution @xmath21 of the monopole equations . denoting by @xmath22 the connection induced by the @xmath9connection @xmath23 on the determinant bundle of the spinor bundle ,",
    "we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the scalar curvature of @xmath20 .    given any class @xmath26 , denote by @xmath27 the projection of @xmath28 into the subspace @xmath29 of @xmath20self - dual harmonic forms along the subspace @xmath30 of @xmath20anti - self - dual harmonic forms .",
    "the argument above really proves @xmath31    if @xmath8 is a @xmath9structure on @xmath10 with non - zero seiberg ",
    "witten invariant , then , by proposition  [ p : blowup ] and the subsequent remark , there are @xmath9structures @xmath14 on @xmath18 with non - zero seiberg  witten invariants and with @xmath32 for any choice of the signs @xmath33",
    ". choose the signs so that @xmath34 then @xmath35 where we have used the inequality @xmath36 which is equivalent to the assertion that the moduli space associated with @xmath8 has non - negative dimension .",
    "thus , we have proved @xmath37 for every metric @xmath20 on @xmath1 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath20 is einstein .",
    "then the chern ",
    "weil integrals for the euler characteristic and the signature of @xmath1 give @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the self - dual part of the weyl tensor of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore @xmath40 , which implies @xmath41 .",
    "theorem  [ t : blowup ] was proved by lebrun  @xcite , who also discussed the borderline case @xmath42 , in the case where @xmath10 is complex or symplectic . in that case",
    "the blown up manifold @xmath1 is also complex , respectively symplectic , so that proposition  [ p : blowup ] is not needed .",
    "the following is the main result of this section , giving the examples mentioned in the introduction .",
    "[ t : main ] there are infinitely many pairs @xmath43 of simply connected closed oriented smooth @xmath0manifolds such that :    * @xmath44 is homeomorphic to @xmath45 , * if @xmath46 , then @xmath44 and @xmath47 are not homotopy equivalent , * @xmath45 admits an einstein metric but @xmath44 does not , * @xmath48 .",
    "note that 3 ) implies in particular that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are not diffeomorphic .",
    "we claim that there are simply connected minimal complex surfaces @xmath49 , @xmath45 of general type such that if we take @xmath50 , for a suitable @xmath51 with @xmath52 , then the pairs @xmath43 have all the desired properties .",
    "the last property , the strict hitchin ",
    "thorpe inequality , follows from the noether and miyaoka  yau inequalities for @xmath45 , which , by the first property , has the same euler characteristic and signature as @xmath44 .    if we take @xmath45 to have ample canonical bundle , then the results of aubin and yau on the calabi conjecture show that @xmath45 admits a khler ",
    "einstein metric , compare  @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath44 does not admit any einstein metric by theorem  [ t : blowup ] .",
    "the crucial issue then is to arrange that @xmath45 , with ample canonical bundle , is homeomorphic to the @xmath51fold blowup of @xmath49 , with @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath44 will be automatically non - spin , @xmath44 and @xmath45 will be homeomorphic by freedman s classification  @xcite as soon as @xmath45 is non - spin and has the same euler characteristic and the same signature as @xmath44 .",
    "one can find suitable surfaces using the known results on the geography of surfaces of general type , see  @xcite for a summary of the results .",
    "to exhibit concrete examples , instead of working with the topological euler characteristic and the signature , we shall use the first chern number @xmath54 and the euler characteristic of the structure sheaf @xmath55 .    under blowing up",
    ", @xmath56 drops by one and @xmath57 is constant .",
    "thus , the miyaoka  yau inequality for @xmath49 implies @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , @xmath59 will be smaller still , because simply connected surfaces @xmath49 are not known to exist if we get too close to the miyaoka  yau line @xmath60 .    the minimal surface @xmath45 satisfies the same inequalities on its characteristic numbers as @xmath44 .",
    "if the canonical bundle of @xmath45 is very ample , then castelnuovo s theorem , see  @xcite page 228 , gives @xmath61 , which will contradict the above upper bound for @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath45 must be chosen to have ample but not very ample canonical bundle , and will be in the sector where @xmath62 the first being the noether inequality .",
    "the results of xiao gang and z  chen , cf  @xcite , show that all non - spin simply connected surfaces @xmath45 with ample canonical bundle which are in this sector , and not too close to the line @xmath63 , will have companions @xmath44 as required , obtained by blowing up minimal surfaces @xmath49 . note that by beauville s theorem on the canonical map , cf  @xcite page 228 , all the @xmath45 will be double covers of ruled surfaces .",
    "we can avoid using the results of xiao and chen by taking for @xmath45 the following family of horikawa surfaces , cf  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath64 be the hirzebruch surface whose section at infinity @xmath65 has self - intersection @xmath66 , and let @xmath45 be a double cover of @xmath64 branched in a smooth curve homologous to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the class of the fiber .",
    "the double cover is simply connected as @xmath69 is ample , and @xmath70 is not @xmath71divisible and so @xmath45 is not spin . moreover , @xmath72 is the pullback of an ample line bundle and therefore ample , so that @xmath45 admits a khler ",
    "einstein metric .",
    "the characteristic numbers of @xmath45 are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "now , by the classical geography results of persson  @xcite , for all @xmath75 large enough there are simply connected surfaces @xmath49 of general type with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , so that the @xmath78fold blowup @xmath44 of @xmath49 is homeomorphic to @xmath45 .    the pairs @xmath43 have all the desired properties .",
    "the examples of manifolds without einstein metrics given by lebrun  @xcite , namely blowups of hypersurfaces in @xmath79 , can not be used to prove theorem  [ t : main ] because they violate the noether inequality .",
    "they are therefore not homeomorphic to minimal surfaces for which the resolution of the calabi conjecture gives existence of an einstein metric .    in view of theorem  [ t : main ]",
    ", one can ask how many smooth structures with einstein metrics and how many without , a given topological manifold has . on the one hand , using for example the work of fintushel  stern , one can show that one has infinitely many choices for the smooth structures of the manifolds @xmath49 in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] , which remain distinct under blowing up points .",
    "thus , one has infinitely many smooth manifolds one can use for each @xmath44 , not admitting any einstein metrics . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that there are homeomorphic non - diffeomorphic minimal surfaces of general type , cf  @xcite , page 410 , and the references cited there .",
    "in fact , the number of distinct smooth structures among sets of homeomorphic minimal surfaces of general type can be arbitrarily large  @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to check that all the examples in  @xcite and  @xcite have ample canonical bundle , and therefore have khler  einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature .",
    "however , all those examples have @xmath80 , and can therefore not be used as the @xmath45 in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "still , those examples show that a given simply connected topological manifold can have an arbitrarily large number of smooth structures admitting einstein metrics .",
    "compare theorem  [ t : top ] below .",
    "we have seen that existence of einstein metrics on closed @xmath0manifolds depends in an essential way on the smooth structure .",
    "i believe that the issue of uniqueness , up to the sign of the scalar curvature , is also tied to the smooth structure . more specifically :      such questions were raised in  @xcite , pages 1819 , and are also addressed in  @xcite .",
    "what is new here , and in  @xcite , is that the answer depends on the smooth structure , and also seems to depend on the dimension .",
    "the conjecture is interesting because it is sharp  it would be false if one did not fix the smooth structure , but only the underlying topological manifold :    [ t : top ] there are simply connected homeomorphic but non - diffeomorphic smooth @xmath0manifolds @xmath1 and @xmath10 , such that @xmath1 admits an einstein metric of positive scalar curvature , and @xmath10 admits an einstein metric of negative scalar curvature .      for @xmath10",
    "we take the simply connected numerical godeaux surface constructed by craighero ",
    "gattazzo  @xcite and studied recently by dolgachev ",
    "werner  @xcite .",
    "this has ample canonical bundle , so that by the work of aubin and yau it admits a khler ",
    "einstein metric of negative scalar curvature .    by freedman",
    "s classification  @xcite , @xmath1 and @xmath10 are homeomorphic .",
    "that they are not diffeomorphic is clear from  @xcite .",
    "the argument carried out there for the barlow surface , cf  @xcite , works even more easily for the craighero ",
    "gattazzo surface as there is no complication arising from @xmath83curves .",
    "alternatively , the fact that @xmath1 and @xmath10 have khler  einstein metrics of opposite signs implies via seiberg ",
    "witten theory that they are non - diffeomorphic .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "homeomorphic non - diffeomorphic manifolds with einstein metrics are known  @xcite , though in those examples all the metrics have positive scalar curvature .",
    "although the examples of  @xcite are consistent with a higher - dimensional analogue of the above conjecture , such a generalisation is false :      let @xmath1 and @xmath10 be as in theorem  [ t : top ] . then the @xmath75fold products @xmath86 and @xmath87 have khler  einstein metrics of positive , respectively negative , scalar curvature .",
    "however , as @xmath1 and @xmath10 are simply connected and homeomorphic , they are @xmath88cobordant .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are also @xmath88cobordant for all @xmath75 , and for @xmath84 are diffeomorphic by the @xmath88cobordism theorem .",
    "theorem  [ t : top ] and corollary 2.3 have also been proved independently by catanese and lebrun  @xcite . instead of the craighero ",
    "gattazzo surface they use the barlow surface , showing that it has deformations with ample canonical bundle .",
    "conjecturally , the barlow and craighero ",
    "gattazzo surfaces are deformation equivalent , and therefore diffeomorphic ."
