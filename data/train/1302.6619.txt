    "an important discovery from the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ was two broad absorption features at 1400  and 1600  in hydrogen - dominated ( da ) white dwarfs cooler than 20,000 k and 13,500 k , respectively @xcite .",
    "subsequently , these features were explained by @xcite and @xcite as ly @xmath0 satellite lines from collisions among h - h ( 1600  ) and h - h@xmath1 ( 1400  ) .",
    "these quasi - molecular absorption lines help to constrain stellar temperature and surface gravity for da white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "g29 - 38 , gd 133 and gd 31 , the targets described in this letter , all show these quasi - molecular absorption features when observed with the _ iue _ [ @xcite , _ iue _ archive ] . here",
    ", we report first detections of true molecular hydrogen in these three white dwarfs , by employing the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. these three stellar atmospheres are among the hottest stellar environments where photospheric molecular hydrogen has ever been detected .",
    "g29 - 38 and gd 133 were observed as part of program 12290 during _ hst _ cycle 18 , which focuses on using externally polluted white dwarfs to assess the volatile abundances of accreted extrasolar planetesimals [ see @xcite and references within ] .",
    "g29 - 38 and gd 133 were chosen because they show a high degree of atmospheric pollution from optical studies @xcite and display excess infrared radiation @xcite . as part of our program to study hyades white dwarfs @xcite , ultraviolet data for gd 31 were retrieved from the _ hst _ archive of the snapshot program 12169 ( pi : b. gnsicke ) .    for g29 - 38 and gd 133 , the cos set - up was similar to that employed for gd 40 and g241 - 6 , as previously reported in @xcite .",
    "the g130 m grating was used with central wavelength 1300  and wavelength coverage of 1142 -1288  ( strip b ) and 1298 -1443  ( strip a ) .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath2 20,000 .",
    "total exposure times , from combining 4 separate exposures for g29 - 38 and 5 for gd 133 , were 9032 sec and 13,460 sec , respectively .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is at least 8 for strip b and 15 for strip a for both stars .",
    "the raw data were processed under the pipeline calcos 2.18.5 .",
    "because g29 - 38 is a zz ceti star with multiple pulsation modes @xcite , which lead to considerable changes in flux levels and continuum shape in each individual exposure , calcos processing can not fully correct for these factors . instead , we fitted the continuum of each calcos - extracted spectrum with a low - order spline3 polynomial and combined the normalized spectra with iraf .",
    "we did not find any noticeable differences in line strength in each exposure .",
    "gd 133 is also a zz ceti but the pulsation amplitude is much lower @xcite and we simply adopt the pipeline reduced spectra . for gd 31",
    ", the g130 m configuration has a central wavelength of 1291  , as described in @xcite .",
    "the total exposure time was 1200 sec and the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath2 7 for strip a. we also used the output from the calcos pipeline for gd 31 .",
    "apart from the absorption lines from heavy elements in g29 - 38 and gd 133 , which will be discussed in @xcite , we see numerous quasi - periodic features , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "they are ubiquitous between 1310  and 1443  , almost the entire strip a. clearly , these features are real and not instrumental artifacts , such as fixed pattern noise , for the following reasons . unlike gd 40 and g241 - 6 @xcite , two other white dwarfs observed in the same program with the same instrumental set - up , these features were only present in the spectra of g29 - 38 and gd 133 .",
    "furthermore , they are at the same wavelength in each separate exposure .",
    "although initially puzzled , after comparing with the ultraviolet spectrum of the sun @xcite , we realized the absorption wavelengths exactly match those of molecular hydrogen .",
    "all the recognizable features correspond to lyman band transitions from @xmath3@xmath4= 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 to @xmath3@xmath5 = 0 and werner band transitions from @xmath3@xmath4=2 , 3 to @xmath3@xmath5 = 0 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that we have accidentally found h@xmath6 in white dwarf atmospheres !",
    "we present the strongest lyman band h@xmath6 lines in table [ tab : h2 ] ; they are all appreciably stronger than the werner bands in our observed wavelength interval .",
    "we serendipitously identified molecular hydrogen in a third star , gd 31 , which may be a high - mass escaping member of the hyades cluster @xcite .",
    "the data are noisier but clearly four absorption features are seen ; these correspond to the strongest h@xmath6 lyman band lines and their blends in g29 - 38 , at the correct wavelengths , as presented in table [ tab : h2 ] and figure 1 .",
    "according to the saha equation , molecular hydrogen is most concentrated in low temperature , high density environments .",
    "previously , ro - vibrational lines from h@xmath6 have been detected in cool stellar atmospheres in the infrared @xcite and in the sun s ultraviolet emission spectrum @xcite .",
    "our ultraviolet detection of photospheric h@xmath6 introduces a new aspect to stellar physics . with stellar parameters of t@xmath7 = 11,820 k , log g=8.40 for g29 - 38 @xcite and t@xmath7=12,121",
    "k , log g = 8.005 for gd 133 @xcite , we computed white dwarf model atmospheres @xcite and calculated the number density of molecular hydrogen relative to atomic hydrogen , n(h@xmath6)/n(h ) , as shown in figure 2 . at maximum ,",
    "molecular hydrogen is still 10@xmath8 and 10@xmath9 less than the amount of atomic hydrogen in g29 - 38 and gd 133 , respectively .",
    "these computed ratios are comparable to , but at the higher end of the concentration of trace elements in heavily polluted white dwarfs @xcite . because molecular hydrogen is distributed over a large number of ro - vibrational levels , each individual line is relatively weak .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , h@xmath6 is used to resolve a major temperature puzzle for gd 31 . due to its high gravity ,",
    "the equivalent widths ( ews ) of 4 detected h@xmath6 lines in gd 31 ( t=13,700 k , log g=8.67 ) are comparable to those in gd 133 ; there is a substantial amount of molecular hydrogen in the atmosphere of gd 31 .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , we computed the model spectra for g29 - 38 and gd 133 following @xcite with all the line data obtained from the kurucz webpage @xcite and the h@xmath6 partition function from @xcite . in a statistical sense , the model well represents the data and reproduces most molecular hydrogen features",
    "however , the fit to individual lines is rather poor due to the lack of accurate broadening parameters .",
    "the z astrophysical plasma properties ( zapp ) collaboration is actively involved in creating white dwarf photospheres in the lab and determining line broadening parameters @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the cos ultraviolet observations can be substantially improved with accurate physical parameters for the h@xmath6 lines .",
    "another aspect of this discovery is that by constraining the abundance of the hd molecule , we can place a limit on the d / h ratio .",
    "it is generally believed that all deuterium is primordial from the big bang nucleosynthesis and destroyed in stellar interiors @xcite . any amount ,",
    "if present , in the white dwarf atmosphere must come from some external source , likely relic planetesimals .",
    "the values are not very constraining for the targets presented here .",
    "but if cooler stars can be observed with cos with a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio , then more meaningful upper limits or actual detections of the hd molecule in white dwarf atmospheres may be anticipated .    in white dwarfs cooler than 12,000 k ,",
    "h@xmath6 is present but usually there is not enough ultraviolet flux to make observations in a time - efficient manner .",
    "the environment in hotter stars is typically more hostile for molecular hydrogen but high pressure may still enable detection of h@xmath6 .",
    "with the _ hst _ , molecular hydrogen was detected for the first time in white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the three stars , g29 - 38 , gd 133 and gd 31 , have temperatures between 11,800 k and 13,700 k. h@xmath6 can be used as an independent constraint to white dwarf atmospheric conditions .",
    "this opens a door to many future explorations .",

    "the spectra are smoothed with a 5 point boxcar and shifted by 39 km s@xmath10 , 58 km s@xmath10 and 89 km s@xmath10 for g29 - 38 , gd 133 and gd 31 respectively , to be in the heliocentric reference frame @xcite . for clarity , the spectrum for gd",

    "the red dashed lines are our computed model spectra .",
    "statistically , the models reproduce the data but the fit to individual lines is not ideal . for g29 - 38 and gd 133 , the entire spectrum in strip a ( 1298 - 1443  ) shows numerous ro - vibrational lines of h@xmath6 .",
