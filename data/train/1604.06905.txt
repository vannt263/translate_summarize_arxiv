    "let @xmath6 be a compact connected oriented surface with @xmath7 , and let @xmath8 be its fundamental group based at a point @xmath9 . the _ mapping class group _ @xmath10 consists of the isotopy classes of ( orientation - preserving ) self - homeomorphisms of @xmath6 fixing the boundary pointwise .",
    "`` magnus representations '' usually refer to those `` representations '' of subgroups of @xmath10 that are defined by assigning to an @xmath11 the matrix with entries in @xmath12 $ ] consisting of fox s free derivatives of @xmath13 with respect to a fixed basis of @xmath14 .",
    "thus they have a group - theoretical definition , which goes through the automorphism group of @xmath14 .",
    "birman coined the terminology `` magnus representations '' in the third chapter of her book @xcite , where it is observed that these kinds of `` representations '' arise from matrix representations of free groups dating back to magnus @xcite .",
    "birman gave there an algebraic exposition and survey of these `` representations '' , explaining for instance how far they are from being group homomorphisms , or analyzing their kernels and images .",
    "one of her motivations was to give a unified treatment of the _ burau representation _ of the braid group and the _ gassner representation _ of the pure braid group .",
    "these correspond to the case where the surface @xmath6 is a disk with marked points or holes , and are defined from the `` magnus representations '' by reducing the coefficients in @xmath12 $ ] to some appropriate commutative  rings .",
    "the gassner representation of the pure braid group was later extended to string links ( also called `` pure tangles '' ) by le dimet @xcite .",
    "kirk , livingston and wang gave a topological interpretation of this extension and a simple proof of its invariance under concordance @xcite .",
    "their approach is based on a natural action of the monoid of string links on the twisted homology of a punctured disk , and relies on the topological interpretation of fox s free derivatives in terms of universal covers . in these works ,",
    "the study of the burau and gassner representations is partly motivated by their tight connections with the alexander polynomial of links .",
    "more recently , cimasoni and turaev extended these representations to arbitrary tangles @xcite .",
    "their invariant is defined as a functor from the category of ( colored ) tangles to the category of `` lagrangian relations '' between skew - hermitian modules .    in the case of a surface @xmath6 of positive genus ,",
    "magnus representations have been used and studied by morita @xcite , suzuki @xcite and perron @xcite among others . in this case too , there is a group - theoretical definition in terms of fox s free derivatives as well as a topological definition using twisted homology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the magnus representation is extended in @xcite to the monoid of homology cobordisms ( also called `` homology cylinders '' ) , which are higher - genus versions of string links . in these works ,",
    "the study of the magnus representation is driven by its relations to the alexander polynomial and reidemeister torsions of closed @xmath3-manifolds , and by its role in the study of the `` johnson homomorphisms '' .",
    "we refer to sakasai @xcite for an overview of these topics . in this paper , inspired by the above - mentioned work of cimasoni and turaev",
    ", we construct a functorial extension of the magnus representations to a certain category of @xmath3-dimensional cobordisms .    to be more specific , our framework is the category @xmath15 of @xmath3-dimensional cobordisms introduced by crane and yetter @xcite .",
    "the objects of this category are compact connected oriented surfaces @xmath16 of arbitrary genus @xmath17 , with exactly one boundary component , and the morphisms are @xmath3-dimensional cobordisms with corners between such surfaces .",
    "the category @xmath15 originates from the study of @xmath3-dimensional topological quantum field theories ( tqft s ) .",
    "we consider here the refinement @xmath2 of this category where the surfaces and @xmath3-manifolds are equipped with a representation of their fundamental group in a _ fixed _",
    "group @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , we assume that @xmath1 is a subgroup of the group of units of an integral domain  @xmath0 , and that @xmath0 has an involutive ring endomorphism which extends the map of  @xmath1 given by @xmath18 .",
    "recall from @xcite that the category @xmath19 of _ lagrangian relations _ is defined as follows : objects are finitely generated @xmath0-modules @xmath20 equipped with a non - degenerate skew - hermitian form @xmath21 , and morphisms @xmath22 are lagrangian submodules of @xmath23 .",
    "the following construction can be regarded as a tqft - like extension of the magnus representations . + * theorem i. * _ there exists a functor @xmath24 which is defined as follows . at the level of objects",
    ", @xmath25 assigns to any pair @xmath26 the skew - hermitian @xmath0-module @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a version of the equivariant intersection form with coefficients in @xmath0 twisted by @xmath30 . at the level of morphisms",
    ", @xmath25 assigns to any cobordism @xmath31 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 the ( closure of ) the kernel of the @xmath0-linear map @xmath34 induced by the inclusions @xmath35 . _ + one difficulty to adapt the work of cimasoni and turaev from tangles to cobordisms lies in the construction of a skew - hermitian form on @xmath36 : here the form @xmath37 is derived from the homotopy intersection pairing that turaev introduced in @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of considering the twisted homology of @xmath16 relative to a base point @xmath38 ( instead of the absolute twisted homology as in @xcite ) is that the module associated to the surface @xmath39 is always free of rank @xmath40 , regardless of the way coefficients are twisted by @xmath30 .",
    "another difference with their work is that we will deal with monoidality .",
    "indeed , the boundary - connected sums of surfaces and @xmath3-manifolds induce a monoidal structure on the category @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce the category @xmath41 of _ pointed lagrangian relations _ where each skew - hermitian @xmath0-module is endowed with a distinguished element of its rationalization .",
    "this refinement of the category @xmath42 has a monoidal structure defined by a skew version of the direct sum , and the above functor @xmath25 can be refined to preserve these monoidal structures .",
    "( see theorem [ maintheorem ] and proposition [ prop : monoidality ] for precise statements . )",
    "apart for the aforesaid differences , the proof of theorem i follows essentially the same lines as the construction of cimasoni and turaev .    there is a relation of @xmath43-dimensional homology cobordism between @xmath3-dimensional cobordisms .",
    "we denote this by  @xmath44 and call it the relation of _ homology concordance _ , since it is an analogue of the concordance relation for tangles .",
    "as one may expect , the magnus functor descends to the quotient category @xmath45 ( see proposition [ prop : h_cobordism_rel ] ) .",
    "for instance , when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the functor @xmath25 provides a functor from the quotient category @xmath48 to the category of lagrangian relations between symplectic @xmath49-modules .",
    "this is essentially the tqft - like functor introduced by donaldson @xcite as a tool to re - prove the surgery formulas for the casson invariant and @xmath3-dimensional seiberg",
    " witten invariants . under some homological assumptions on the cobordisms ,",
    "this `` tqft '' is also equivalent to a construction of frohman and nicas which involves moduli spaces of flat @xmath50-connections , @xcite .",
    "in the recent literature , the equivalence relation @xmath44 has been mainly studied on the monoid @xmath51 of _ homology cobordisms _ over the surface @xmath16 : see for instance @xcite .",
    "we consider here the submonoid @xmath52 of @xmath51 consisting of those homology cobordisms that are compatible with a fixed representation @xmath53 .",
    "since it can be viewed as a submonoid of the monoid of endomorphisms of the object @xmath54 in @xmath2 , we consider the restriction of @xmath25 to @xmath52 and we find that it is equivalent to the magnus representation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the field of fractions of @xmath0 ( see proposition [ prop : magnus ] ) . here ,",
    "following @xcite again , we regard unitary isomorphisms between skew - hermitian @xmath0-modules as morphisms in the category @xmath19 by considering their set - theoretical graphs .",
    "in particular , we obtain that the representations of @xmath57 arising from the functor @xmath25 coincide with the usual magnus representations , so that they can be computed very easily using fox s free differential calculus .",
    "more generally , we explain in section [ subsec : heegaard ] how to compute @xmath25 on an arbitrary cobordism which is presented by a heegaard splitting .",
    "for instance , these techniques may be applied to compute @xmath25 on the generators of the monoidal category @xmath2 that arise from the generating system of @xmath15 given in @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the monoidal category @xmath15 is braided and the object @xmath58 therein is a `` braided hopf algebra '' : since the functor @xmath25 is monoidal , this rich algebraic structure reflects in the monoidal category  @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we apply the magnus functor @xmath25 to the study of the _ alexander functor _",
    "@xmath59 introduced in @xcite , which provides a kind of tqft for the alexander polynomial of knots in homology 3-spheres .",
    "this functor is defined on @xmath60 too , but takes values in the category @xmath61 of graded @xmath0-modules and @xmath0-linear maps which are only defined up to multiplication by an element of @xmath62 , and which may shift the degree .",
    "it can be constructed using either the alexander function introduced by lescop for @xmath3-manifolds with boundary @xcite , or using the theory of reidemeister torsions .",
    "the functor @xmath63 assigns to any pair @xmath54 the graded @xmath0-module @xmath64 , and it assigns to any cobordism @xmath31 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 an @xmath0-linear map of degree @xmath65 .",
    "our second main result is the following ( see theorem [ th : alex_magnus ] for a precise statement ) . +",
    "* theorem ii . * _ for any cobordism @xmath31 from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , the @xmath0-module @xmath66 is tantamount to an @xmath0-linear map of degree @xmath65 @xmath67 which is defined up to multiplication by an element of @xmath68 and satisfies @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a kind of `` relative '' alexander polynomial for the @xmath3-manifold @xmath71 . _",
    "+ the above factorization formula for @xmath72 depends on the choice of a free submodule @xmath73 of @xmath74 of rank @xmath75 , which is _ rationally _",
    "( i.e@xmath76 after taking coefficients in  @xmath77 ) a supplementary subspace of @xmath66 .",
    "in addition to giving an `` operator '' viewpoint on the magnus functor , theorem ii fully computes the alexander functor by showing that @xmath78 splits into two parts : an `` operator '' part  namely @xmath79  which is invariant under homology concordance @xmath44 , and a `` scalar '' part  namely @xmath80  which does not have such property .",
    "this generalizes a phenomenon that has been observed in the special case of homology cobordisms @xcite : see remark  [ rem : hc ] .",
    "we conclude by mentioning that the proof of this formula can be adapted to the situation of tangles , which implies a similar relationship between the alexander representation of tangles constructed in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) and the functor of cimasoni and turaev .",
