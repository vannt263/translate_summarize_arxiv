    "mounting experimental evidence for electronic quantum coherence in photosynthetic energy transfer @xcite has spawned much debate about both the detailed nature and the biological role of such quantum dynamical features .",
    "quantum coherence is usually encountered in the first , light harvesting stage of photosynthesis .",
    "it includes two distinct but not mutually excludeusive phenomena that can be differentiated by the choice of basis used to describe the electronic excitations . in the site basis , corresponding to the excitation of individual pigment molecules , coherence emerges in molecular aggregates even in thermal equilibrium , since eigenstates are delocalized over multiple chromophores . such coherence between sites",
    "can enhance the rate of biological energy transfer by up to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it is coherence in the exciton basis , that is , superpositions of the energy eigenstates , which drives quantum beating via the schrdinger equation .",
    "it is this type of coherence on which we will focus here , and thus in the remainder of this paper , the term ` coherence ' refers to coherence in the exciton basis .",
    "photosynthetic systems at ambient temperatures have been shown to exhibit this kind of quantum beating when artificially excited @xcite , but the significance of these discoveries remains unclear .",
    "a broad deficiency is the lack of plausible physical mechanisms for how this coherence could arise in and influence biological energy transfer .",
    "for example , the suggestion that transport in these systems features speedups reminiscent of quantum search algorithms @xcite has been shown to be invalid @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of long - lasting and delocalized quantum beats alone are not sufficient to determine that they are biologically relevant , since these features arise due to strong inter - chromophoric couplings @xcite , which independently yield fast transport rates under almost any theoretical model , even those which entirely neglect quantum coherence .    in this work",
    "we address the question of what physical mechanisms lie behind the origin and biological role of electronic coherence in the exciton basis . while our theoretical analysis is general , to make illustrative demonstrations of specific mechanistic features we take physical parameters from a prototypical system , the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex of green sulfur bacteria .",
    "fmo is an extensively studied protein - pigment complex @xcite that exhibits excitonic quantum beats @xcite and entanglement @xcite at room temperature .",
    "biologically , fmo acts as an energy transmitting wire , delivering an electronic excitation created by photon absorption in the chlorosome antenna to a reaction center where it induces charge separation .",
    "it exists in the form of a trimer with a protein backbone and @xmath0 bacteriochlorophyll - a molecules , each with different transition energies set by the local electrostatic environment .",

    "the section of the energy transfer path from site 1 to 2 is particularly unusual , since it is energetically uphill while these sites also have the strongest electronic coupling of any pair of sites in the complex .",
    "it has been speculated that these factors may indicate a role for quantum coherence in contributing to unidirectional energy flow through this system by avoiding trapping in local minima of the energy landscape @xcite .",
    "all other steps of the fmo electronic energy transfer pathways in the direction towards the reaction center are energetically downhill , consistent with a pathway that would be optimal for classical energy transport . a key question that is of special importance for the fmo complex ,",
    "is thus how the system efficiently directs energy transport away from the chlorosome antenna towards the reaction center .",
    "clearly the overall energy gradient in the system plays a role , but does electronic coherence also facilitate unidirectional energy transfer ? more generally , can excitonic coherence assist excitation transfer over the uphill steps found in rough energy landscapes ?    a striking feature of all experiments showing electronic quantum beatings in photosynthesis to date is that they have been performed on small sub - units of light harvesting antenna systems , such as the 7 pigments of the fmo complex @xcite or the 14 pigments in lhc ii @xcite . yet",
    "natural light harvesting antennas are typically composed of hundreds or thousands of pigment molecules organized into many pigment - protein complexes through which energy passes on route to the reaction center @xcite . in addition , natural excitation is by sunlight , not ultrafast laser pulses .",
    "there is dispute about whether or not coherences can arise after excitation by natural light @xcite , but many pigment - protein sub - units are actually more likely to receive excitations indirectly , as a result of weak coupling to another complex in the larger network .",
    "clearly , understanding the role of excitonic coherence in a single protein - pigment complex requires placing the energy transfer within and through that system in the context of appropriate initial conditions , as determined by its role in the larger `` supercomplex . ''",
    "accordingly , a second key question for evaluating the relevance of quantum beats to energy transfer on biological scales is whether or not excitonic coherence could be either arise or be maintained in the process of transfer between different sub - units .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we shall address these two open questions with a general theoretical framework employing a novel basis for analyzing the excitonic dynamics of weakly coupled pigment - protein complexes .",
    "first , we develop an analysis of such weakly coupled complexes that suggests a mechanism for how coherence should arise and recur in the process of energy transfer .",
    "we find that coherence can continue to be regenerated during long - range energy transport between weakly linked sub - units of a larger excitonic system .",
    "this is the ` propagation ' of quantum coherence , whereby a process of continual renewal following incoherent quantum jumps may allow non - zero coherence to last indefinitely , despite rapid decay after each jump . this has significant implications for long - range energy transfer in light harvesting supercomplexes composed of multiple units that individually support coherence , such as photosystems i and ii @xcite .",
    "second , we address the question as to whether such spatially propagated intra - complex quantum coherence enables unidirectional flow of energy , with a specific example that is inspired by the uphill energetic step in fmo .",
    "we construct an explicitly solvable ratchet model to show that in this situation , the non - equilibrium nature of even limited quantum beating may allow for qualitatively new types of dynamics .",
    "in particular , we show that under biologically plausible conditions , these dynamical features could allow for the operation of a coherently enabled ratchet effect to enhance directed energy flow through light harvesting systems .",
    "these analyses provide new understanding of physical mechanisms reliant on quantum coherence that could be relevant to the function of natural photosynthetic systems .",
    "in photosynthetic energy transfer , excitons typically need to travel through a series of protein - pigment complexes before reaching reaction centers @xcite . to accurately understand the role of coherent dynamics between individual sub - units in such a supercomplex , it is first necessary to understand which particular sub - unit states donate or accept excitations for inter - complex transfer .",
    "as we shall show in this work , the nature of these states informs us whether or not coherence arises under natural conditions in the process of energy transfer .",
    "moreover , in the context of a light - harvesting complex which is a subcomponent of a larger light - harvesting apparatus , the precise nature of the acceptor states on the complex and the donor states from the complex is paramount to assessing the possible relevance of coherent dynamics in the complex . to draw an analogy to the circuit model of quantum computation @xcite ,",
    "these states serve as effective choices of initial states and measurement basis states , respectively , for dynamics on an individual complex . both of these states need to differ from energy eigenstates in order for strictly unitary dynamics to influence measurement outcomes .",
    "the measurement outcomes correspond to observable energy transfer , for which differences in rates or success probabilities could in turn influence biological function .",
    "since inter - complex couplings are relatively weak , in our analysis we treat them perturbatively , as in multichromophoric generalizations of frster theory used to calculate overall transition rates between donor and acceptor complexes consisting of multiple chromophores @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the equation of motion for the reduced density matrix , which is derived with the following adaptation of the multichromophoric energy transfer rate model @xcite .",

    ", we see that growth of an acceptor population @xmath39 is proportional to populations only of the coupled donor @xmath40 .",

    ", inter - complex transfer rates may show oscillations reflecting donor quantum beats , since the icc states on the donor which transmit excitations do not necessarily correspond to energy eigenstates . while this part of our argument is only rigorous in the case of weak system - bath coupling , which is not necessarily the case for fmo and other light harvesting systems @xcite",
    ", our simulations find excellent agreement even for moderate strength environmental coupling , as we show below .",
    "to test this analysis of inter - complex energy transfer , we first consider its predictions for the special case in which there is only one non - zero inter - complex coupling in the icc basis , @xmath41 .",
    "if the acceptor is always initialized in the state @xmath42 , then when back - transfer to the donor is neglected as is valid in the perturbative limit , the acceptor density matrix should be well described by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the greens function denoting evolution of the acceptor - bath system for time @xmath45 , with the bath initialized at equilibrium .",

    "two features are of particular significance , since they show that these icc - dominated dynamics satisfy the conditions that are necessary for intra - dimer coherence to be relevant to larger scale energy transfer , namely that the dynamics guarantee the preparation and measurement of states which are not energy eigenstates .",
    "the first feature is that the inter - dimer transfer rate clearly tracks coherent oscillations of the donor population @xmath62 ( panel a ) .",
    "the second feature is that the acceptor is initialized in a state with non - zero excitonic coherence ( panel b ) .",

    "in particular , excitonic coherence in the acceptor ( and thus coherent beating ) is triggered even when the initial condition in the donor has no such excitonic coherence .",
    "a simple example of the usefulness of the icc basis is to determine the initial conditions for electronic excitation transfer through the fmo complex .",
    "the recently discovered 8th chromophore @xcite provides a plausible donor to the remainder of the complex since it sits on the side nearest the chlorosome antenna complex @xcite . since structural information concerning the location of the fmo complex is limited , standard practice to date has been to choose initial and final conditions for simulation of energy transfer in fmo based on approximate orientation and proximity of chromophores .",
    "the choice of such initial conditions has varied @xcite , particularly with regards to whether or not the initial quantum states include any excitonic coherence .",
    "evaluation of the icc basis between a donor complex consisting solely of site 8 and an acceptor complex consisting of the remainder of the complex ( sites 1 - 7 ) implies that the acceptor state is mostly localized on site 1 ( see appendix [ sec : fmo - hamiltonian - svd ] ) .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ fig : fmo - pathways](a ) .",
    "this initial condition is not an energy eigenstate , so the resulting _ in vivo _ dynamics would necessarily start from a state with coherence in the exciton basis and thus give rise to the quantum beating seen in the laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "the way in which this coherence regenerating transfer mechanism can yield a non - trivial biological role for coherence can be already illustrated with a simple model dimer complex connected to other complexes .",
    "choosing inter - complex couplings to and from the dimer to be at individual sites as above implies that initialization and transfer in the icc basis will be at these sites .",
    "consider preferred ` forward ' excitation transfer to be that from the donor at site 2 onward to the next complex .",
    "then the asymptotic probability of successful transfer through the complex will be proportional to that population . for a dimer ,",

    "the dimer admits two extreme models of energy transfer : quantum beating due to coherent evolution and instantaneous relaxation to thermal equilibrium between excited electronic states .",
    "instantaneous relaxation provides an upper bound on the speed of excitation transfer governed by a classical master equation , since the dynamics governed by such equations are driven toward thermal equilibrium .",

    "figure [ fig : unidirectionality](c ) plots the asymptotic drift velocity of the random walk against the timescale of excitonic coherence .",
    "we determine this coherence time from a best fit of the timescale of exponential decay of intra - dimer excitonic coherence .",
    "the timescale of coherent oscillations was tuned in two ways , ( i ) by changing the bath correlation time and ( ii ) by increasing the spatial correlations between the chromophore - bath couplings @xcite .",
    "we see a close correlation between the timescale for quantum beating and the magnitude of the bias , regardless of the underlying physical mechanism used to tune the coherence time . in general , we can not rule out the possibility that a non - equilibrium / non - markovian classical model might also yield such biased transport .",
    "( we already ruled out such a possibility for a markovian classical model in appendix [ sec : classicalproof ] . ) however , this strong correlation between the duration of quantum beating , independent of its origin , and the asymptotic transport bias supports our interpretation that in this model system the ratchet effect is due to quantum coherent motion .",
    "indeed , the fact that the drift velocity appears to approach a small or zero value as the coherence time goes to zero in figure [ fig : unidirectionality](c ) shows that any contribution deriving from classical non - equilibrium system / non - markovian bath dynamics here is extremely small relative to that deriving from the quantum coherence maintained in the system degrees of freedom .",
    "since our results demonstrate a ratchet effect , it is important to consider why this sort of motion is not forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the answer is that the system is never allowed to reach thermal equilibrium along the infinite chain of dimers .",
    "this feature is shared by the excitations transferred in natural light harvesting systems , which also do not exist for long enough to reach equilibrium .",
    "the resulting directed motion shows some similarity to the operation of a quantum photocell @xcite , where coherence can ( in principle ) allow for enhanced conversion of energy by similarly breaking a limit imposed by detailed balance . in both cases , no additional source of energy is supplied besides that of the non - equilibrium photon which creates the initial excitation .",
    "this contrasts with the operation of typical classical and quantum brownian motors @xcite , where detailed balance is broken by applying an additional driving force .",

    "[ fig : fmo - as - generalized - forster ] , these temporary boosts in population at site 2 due to coherence should correspond to enhanced biological function , since they drive excitations preferentially toward site 3 instead of backwards toward the antenna complex .",
    "the 1 - 2 dimer in the fmo complex thus appears to act as one link of our proposed ratchet for energy transport , thereby enhancing unidirectional energy flow through this pathway of the fmo complex .",
    "consistent with previous numerical estimates of the contribution of coherent energy transfer to transfer efficiency in photosynthetic systems @xcite , we expect that any quantitative enhancement to the speed of energy transfer through fmo due to such a limited ratchet effect will be relatively small compared to the contribution of incoherent energy relaxation .",

    "it is also conceivable that the cumulative contribution of many such small contributions from propagating coherence through the entire photosynthetic apparatus of green sulphur bacteria ( of which fmo is only a small part ) could indeed make a major contribution to the speed of energy transfer , as in the full ratchet example .",
    "we have proposed a microscopic mechanism for the propagation of excitonic coherence in energy transfer between photosynthetic complexes .",
    "the mechanism allows coherence to be propagated between sub - units of a large light harvesting `` supercomplex '' that is composed of multiple complexes that individually support coherence .",
    "our analysis shows that the key role in the inter - complex transfer is played by the inter - complex coupling ( icc ) basis , rather than energy or site bases employed by prior analyses . by utilizing icc donor and acceptor states , we showed that coherence can enable biased energy flow through a ratchet mechanism .",
    "we provided evidence that this same principle acts to ensure unidirectional energy flow in the fmo complex .",
    "since one - way transmission of electronic energy from the antenna complex to the reaction center constitutes the main function of the fmo protein in the light harvesting apparatus of green sulfur bacteria , this supports a biological role for the electronic quantum coherence in this particular light harvesting system .",
    "propagating coherence provides both a mechanism by which coherent motion can influence transfer rates and photosynthetic efficiency in light harvesting systems of arbitrary size ( a possible quantum advantage ) , and a scalable method for multi - scale modeling of such excitonic systems without neglecting the contributions of coherence ( practical simulations ) .",
    "our example and analysis of a coherently enabled ratchet effect along a chain of heterodimers demonstrates both of these features .",
    "this proof of principle model shows that even short - lived excitonic coherence can , since it propagates spatially , lead to large scale dynamics that are incompatible with any completely classical description .",
    "we also demonstrated how fully quantum models need only to be used for tightly coupled sub - complexes , while transfer between sub - complexes may take the form of classical hops with connections between states of different sub - complexes constrained by the icc basis .",
    "similar techniques should allow us to assess the role of coherence in natural photosynthetic super - complexes with hundreds of chlorophyll molecules , such as arrays of lh1 and lh2 rings in purple bacteria , and the photosystem i and ii super - complexes of higher plants @xcite .",
    "for example , direct calculation of icc states should help us evaluate the significance of long lasting coherences in bacterial reaction centers @xcite , since these systems are also usually unlikely to absorb light directly @xcite and thus might be benefitting from recurrence of coherence propagated from light harvesting complexes .",
    "some bacterial reaction centers also feature an uphill step opposing the direction of desired energy flow @xcite , resembling the energetic arrangement in the uphill step of the fmo complex .",
    "finally , the dynamics in our chain of heterodimers model constitute a novel type of ratchet that utilizes spatial propagation of quantum coherence in place of a driving force and as such are also of more general interest .",
