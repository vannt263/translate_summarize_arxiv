    "evidence for the presence of dust in elliptical galaxies was given by the optical observations of obscured regions in some systems ( see for instance bertola et al .",
    "1985 , vron & vron 1988 ) and was finally confirmed by the fir observations of the iras satellite ( knapp et al .",
    "1989 , roberts et al .",
    "the low resolution iras data ( @xmath0 1 arcmin ) have to be processed by adequate techniques to provide detailed ( @xmath1 arcmin at 100 @xmath2 m ) information about the dust spatial distribution in nearby elliptical galaxies . in general ,",
    "only the integrated flux of the detected source is available in the iras bands .    despite the intrinsic limits due to the low resolution , knapp et al .",
    "( 1989 ) showed that a significant fraction ( 48@xmath3 ) of the nearby e and s0 galaxies from the revised shapley - ames catalogue ( sandage & tammann 1981 , hereafter rsa ) have been detected by iras at 60 and 100 @xmath2 m at the limiting sensitivity ( about 3 times lower than in the iras point source catalog ) .",
    "it is not surprising that ellipticals contain dust , since the presence of dust is directly related to the stellar formation .",
    "but the coexistence of solid particles with the dominant gas component , which in these galaxies is heated to @xmath4 k and radiates at x - ray wavelengths , is a matter of discussion .",
    "in fact , dust grains should be quickly destroyed by sputtering ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) when in direct contact with the hot gas .",
    "in such an environment the dust has a lifetime of @xmath5 yr .",
    "the question thus follows : where does the dust come from ?    at fir wavelengths ( 60 and 100 @xmath2 m ) the thermal emission is mainly due to large grains ( radius @xmath6 @xmath2 m ) which may have different heating sources , e.g. the general interstellar radiation field or ob stars . in order to discriminate between the two different contributions and to estimate the weight of each of them , several efforts were undertaken",
    "( see for instance calzetti et al .",
    "a reasonable approach is to consider the 60 @xmath2 m flux entirely due to the warm dust ( @xmath740 k ) , while the 100 @xmath2 m flux should be considered the result of two contributions : the warm and the cold ( @xmath710 k ) dust . while a two - component dust model is used to explain the spectral trend for different types of galaxies , it is rarely adopted for elliptical galaxies , which are often characterized by weak fir emission and which are not always detected in all iras bands",
    "therefore , a single color temperature ( from the 60 and 100 @xmath2 m data ) is usually taken as the dust temperature .",
    "it follows that no information about the dust temperature distribution and the dust spatial distribution is available for elliptical galaxies .",
    "the availability of the iso data will provide spectra in a wider ir wavelength range ( 2.5 - 240 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "several attempts to understand the dust nature and origin suggest interesting interpretations by comparing optical and fir data ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 , hereafter gj95 , tsai & mathews 1995 , 1996 ) , by studying the stellar content , or by using a severe and critical approach to the data ( bregman et al .",
    "finally , few elliptical galaxies have been observed at sub - millimeter wavelengths by fich & hodge ( 1991 , 1993 ) .",
    "gj95 found that the dust masses determined from the iras flux densities are roughly an order of magnitude higher than those determined from optical extinction values of dust lanes and patches , in contrast with what happens for spiral galaxies .",
    "the authors suggest that this `` mass discrepancy '' may be explained by the existence of a diffuse component ( within 2 kpc from the center ) , which is not detectable at optical wavelengths . on the other hand",
    ", tsai & mathews ( 1996 ) suggested that , while the distributed dust component is associated with dust recently ejected from evolving stars , another `` extra '' component of dust is present in ellipticals both in dust lanes and rings and/or in other galactic regions . in particular , they postulated that a substantial mass of cold gas remains `` observationally elusive without forming completely into stars '' .",
    "if the extra dust is optically thin in the visible it should be located far from the galactic core region , where the intensity of the starlight and therefore the grain heating is reduced .",
    "the dust spatial distribution suggested by gj95 and by tsai & mathews ( 1996 ) support the two most popular scenarios respectively : the _ evaporation flow _ picture and the _ cooling flow _ picture . in the _ evaporation flow _",
    "scenario the clouds of dust and gas currently observed in ellipticals have mainly an external origin , being associated to events of galaxy interaction and/or mergers and being heated by thermal conduction in the hot gas ( de jong et al .",
    "1990 , sparks et al .",
    "1989 ) . on the contrary ( _ cooling flow _ ) , the internal origin of gas and dust may be explained with both red giant winds ( knapp et al .",
    "1992 ) and by the _ cooling flow _ mechanism , in which mass loss from stars within the galaxy is heated by supernova explosions and by collisions between expanding stellar envelopes during the galaxy formation stage , and then cools and condenses ( fabian et al.1991 ) .    therefore , in ellipticals , the presence of dust and the dust `` mass discrepancy '' are related with the dust spatial distribution , which depends on the nature and the evolution of these systems .",
    "hence , in order to investigate the dust content , dust mass evaluations as accurate as possible are required to estimate the amount of the `` mass discrepancy '' .",
    "since both scenarios suggest the presence of different dust components and the very nature of the galactic environments involves the existence of dust grains at different temperatures , it is necessary to take into account a dust temperature distribution for the dust mass evaluations .",
    "kwan @xmath8 xie ( 1992 ) suggest a theoretical approach to take into account the effects of the dust temperature distribution in the dust mass evaluation .",
    "i present here an application of their method which is discussed and implemented in section 2 .",
    "the results obtained for the sample of ellipticals , introduced in section 3 , are presented and discussed in section 4 by comparing the fir with the visual dust mass evaluation and by discussing the correlation between blue and fir luminosities .",
    "the dust mass can be derived both from optical and from fir observations .",
    "the value of the mass depends on the physical - chemical properties of the solid particles ( i.e. grain radius , grain density and emissivity ) .",
    "the usual approach consists of assuming some values for the grain properties ( hildebrand 1983 ) , while a color temperature is derived from the fir emission .",
    "different authors , however , present slightly different formulae for the evaluation of the dust mass ( thronson & telesco 1986 , greenhouse et al .",
    "1988 , young et al .",
    "1989 , roberts et al .",
    "1991 and thuan & sauvage 1992 ) .",
    "the differences between these relations are only due to different assumptions on the grain parameters and to different derivations of the color temperature .",
    "it should be noticed that , within a flux uncertainty of 10@xmath3 ( which is typical of the high quality iras data ) , all the dust mass values obtained by using the different formulae are in agreement .    a single temperature model is a rough approximation in describing a galactic environment .",
    "the dust is in fact heated by the radiation field , which in turn depends on the sources of luminosity and on their spatial distribution in the galaxy .",
    "the total fir emission is thus likely due to the contribution of dust at different temperatures .",
    "moreover , the iras fir measurements are not adequate to detect the emission coming from cold dust ( @xmath9 k ) which peaks at wavelengths between 200 and 300 @xmath2 m .",
    "i adopt the dust temperature distribution given by kwan & xie ( 1992 ) : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the lower and upper limits of the temperature @xmath14 ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are free parameters that determine the shape of the distribution .",
    "the equations relating the temperature distribution @xmath17 to the luminosity emitted by the dust and to the dust mass are detailed in kwan & xie ( 1992 ) .",
    "due to the observed spectral range , i adopt @xmath12=7 k and @xmath13=60 k , taking into account only temperature distributions peaking at a value intermediate between @xmath12 and @xmath13 and excluding those pairs of @xmath15 and @xmath16 which produce unrealistic distributions ( as , for instance , monotonically increasing or decreasing functions ) .",
    "the main problem in the present approach is to select the proper values for the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the choice being constrained by the ratio of the flux densities at two different wavelengths .",
    "i first identify a range of @xmath15 and @xmath16 pairs which produce the observed flux ratio .",
    "since the same flux ratio can be obtained by functions having quite different shapes , a further constraint is needed .",
    "unfortunately , for none of the galaxies in the sample submillimeter observations are available .",
    "nevertheless , their color temperature may be derived from the flux density ratio ( henning et al .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty in the computed color temperature , i select those distributions @xmath17 that produce the observed flux density ratio and whose peak temperature is comparable to the color temperature .",
    "the selected family of @xmath17 functions obviously satisfies two conditions which are not independent ( being both related to the flux ratio ) .",
    "this fact could in principle affect the reliability of the results .",
    "it turns out , however , that pairs of @xmath15 and @xmath16 which satisfy the same constraints give the same dust mass within the flux uncertainty .    in order to check the method",
    "a simple numerical simulation has been performed .",
    "i considered an artificial galaxy which is not resolved by iras both at 60 and 100 @xmath2 m with a given dust mass and , then , i evaluated the dust content following the present method .",
    "the galaxy dust mass @xmath18 may be roughly estimated by using the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dust grain radius , @xmath21 is the dust grain density and @xmath22 is the number of dust grains .",
    "3 implies the following approximations .",
    "the dust grain radius @xmath20 characterizes the dust grains which contribute to the thermal emission at fir wavelengths .",
    "actually , the uncertainties in the total dust mass introduced by using an average radius instead of a size distribution , are much smaller than those arising from uncertainties in the dust emissivity spectral trend and in the dust temperature distribution ( kwan @xmath8 xie 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath22 is the total number of the dust grains within the observing beam . since the galaxy is not resolved by iras , as it is often the case , eq .",
    "3 gives the total dust mass of the point source .",
    "a dust radius of 0.1 @xmath2 m and a dust grain density of 3 g @xmath23 are currently adopted ( hildebrand 1983 ) and also used in the present article .    concerning the dust emissivity ,",
    "the power - law approximation @xmath24 is used in the computations , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( hildebrand 1983 ) .    by assuming a value for @xmath22 and the temperature distribution @xmath17 , and accounting for the spectral responses of the iras detectors at 60 and 100 @xmath2 m",
    ", the luminosity emitted by the @xmath22 dust grains , as observed within the filter bandpass , can be estimated . the flux ratio and the color temperature of the galaxy",
    "are then computed , while the dust mass of the source is derived from @xmath22 by eq .",
    "a galaxy with @xmath18=@xmath27 m@xmath28 turns out to contain about @xmath22=1.6@xmath29 dust grains .",
    "the galaxy distance is assumed to be 10 mpc . by assuming a @xmath17 with @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 the flux ratio turns out to be about 0.5 .",
    "i use the flux ratio as a constraint to select the pairs @xmath15-@xmath16 producing a @xmath17 whose peak temperature is comparable to the galaxy color temperature of 36 k. among these pairs also the pair @xmath30 and @xmath31 is found ( i.e. exactly the values adopted for the input @xmath17 ) . for the selected pairs of parameters i compute the dust mass which ranges between @xmath32 m@xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the derived values are in agreement with the dust mass of the galaxy within the flux uncertainties , thus confirming the reliability of the method .",
    "futhermore , by using the single temperature model and taking into account the different formulae available ( see sect .",
    "2 ) a dust mass of @xmath33 m@xmath28 is derived .",
    "this result shows that the single temperature model underestimates the dust content .",
    "the same test was performed for different `` artificial galaxies '' with different temperature distributions obtaining always consistent results .",

    "the temperature distribution model enhances the dust `` mass discrepancy '' . in order to explain that discrepancy",
    ", it has to be noticed that the dust mass evaluated from optical observations critically depends on the spatial distribution of the dust with respect to the stars .",
    "usually the extinction is thought to be due to an overlying absorbing screen of dust grains .",
    "that is the geometry where a given amount of dust has the strongest effect on the starlight . in order to test how",
    "a peculiar and oversimplified spatial distribution affects the dust mass evaluation from optical data , i compared the optical dust masses in table 1 to those derived by assuming a more realistic spatial distribution ( e.g. witt et al . 1992 ) and by using the optical data by goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) .",
    "the new optical masses turn out to be enhanced by a factor 2 - 4 , cutting the `` mass discrepancy '' down .",
    "however , even if the `` mass discrepancy '' is reduced by assuming a more realistic spatial distribution , the optical absorption can only account for the dust in the obscured galaxy regions , while the distributed dust component is always neglected .    a similar case concerns the `` extra '' dust component suggested by tsai @xmath8 mathews ( 1996 ) to explain the 60 - 100 @xmath2 m flux ratio : due to its low temperature , it is not detected by iras . following their model ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the contribution of the `` extra '' dust in the sample . taking into account the `` extra '' dust amount ,",
    "the dust masses derived by a single temperature model are slightly enhanced , but the large uncertainties due to the observations and , then , to the temperature evaluation do not allow to judge this enhancement as significative .",
    "one can argue that , with a model of temperature distribution , it is possible to overestimate the dust amount . actually , this can not happen because of the severe constraints which are chosen , whether two different flux ratios are available or when a flux ratio and the relative color temperature are used as it is here suggested . in this respect ,",
    "the last method is also the more conservative , since the warm dust observed at 60 @xmath2 m affects the dust mass evaluation in the sense of underestimating the cold dust amount .",
    "therefore , since these computations are very sensitive to the assumed dust temperature , the model by kwan @xmath8 xie ( 1992 ) greatly improves the mass evaluation by taking into account a wide temperature range , and can be applied to a wide range of galaxy morphological types when , because of lack of the data , it is no possible to adopt and to develop a suitable radiation model .",
    "actually , the uncertainty on the temperature distribution is directly connected to the study of the heating mechanisms and , therefore , to the knowledge of the uv interstellar radiation field .    to this aim , and in order to investigate the origin of the dust in elliptical galaxies , i plot in fig . 3 a and b the dust mass m@xmath39 and the fir luminosity l@xmath40 versus the blue luminosity l@xmath41 for the galaxy sample .",
    "both m@xmath39 and l@xmath40 are correlated to l@xmath41 , in contrast with what has been found by gj95 . therefore , while the absence of correlation between dust mass and blue luminosity in their sample was considered to support the external origin of the dust in ellipticals and the _ evaporation flow _ picture , the present result indicates that a relationship between the dust content and the present day population of stars should be not excluded .",
    "but , as already pointed out by gj95 , a lack or a presence of correlation between m@xmath39 and/or l@xmath40 and l@xmath41 can not be a definitive proof of the external or the internal origin of the dust , due to the fact that the dust destruction mechanisms and timescales in elliptical galaxies are expected to be different depending on the evolutionary state and on the hot gas content of the individual objects .",
    "for this reason , further analysis and , above all , high resolution fir observations are required to understand the origin and the fate of dust in these systems .",

    "the dust having an internal origin does not account for the computed dust masses , which are larger .",

    "the critical point of this picture is to identify the observed diffuse dust , located within 2 kpc from the center , as the dust accreted during the galaxy interaction when high hydrodynamic instabilities are expected .",
    "in particular , the external dust had to be somehow protected from the interaction with the hot gas when moving toward the center .",
    "the problem could be solved with the `` extra '' dust component ( tsai @xmath8 mathews 1996 ) located in very large disks out to the effective radius and , therefore , cold enough to emit at fir and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "this dust can have , in principle , both internal and external origin .",

    "in fact , this assumption would increase the sputtering time and , then , the dust grain density .",
