    "an understanding peculiarities of alfvn oscillations in solid star models is of particular interest for the asteroseismology of final stage ( fs ) compact objects of stellar evolution , white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "the super dense and highly conducting matter of these stars , capable of accumulating magnetic fields of extremely powerful intensity ( e.g. , chanmugam 1992 ) , possesses mechanical elasticity generic to solids .",
    "this suggests that proper account of seismic vibrations of fs stars can be attained working from equations of elastodynamics and magneto - solid - mechanics , contrary to the liquid stars of main sequence ( ms ) whose asteroseismology is adequately modeled by equations of hydrodynamics and magneto - fluid - mechanics .",
    "another important feature distinguishing liquid ms stars from solid fs stars is that the magnetic fields of the ms stars are generated in the dynamo processes whose energy supply comes from central thermonuclear reactive zone ( parker 1979 ) , whereas in the fs stars there are no nuclear energy sources to support persistent convection .",
    "it is commonly believed today that magnetic fields of non - convective fs stars are fossil ( e.g. ferrario and wickramasinghe 2004 ) . in these latter non - convective stars , like white dwarfs ,",
    "the fossil magnetic fields are regarded as frozen in the immobile extremely dense and perfectly conducting matter .",
    "most studies devoted to interpretation of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the electromagnetic emission of fs stars as being produced by lorentz - force - driven alfvn oscillations have been perform within the framework of the fiducial homogeneous model of a solid star with an axisymmetric poloidal internal magnetic field of constant intensity @xmath0,\\\\    \\label{e1.2 }    & & w_m({\\rm pmf})=\\frac{1}{8\\pi}\\int b^2\\,d{\\cal v}=\\frac{1}{6}b^2r^3    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the internal magnetic energy of the star . in particular , in our recent papers ( bastrukov et al 2009a , 2009b )",
    "this model has been invoked to investigate a poorly studied regime of global node - free alfvn oscillations in quaking neutron stars .",
    "based on the well - known argument that magnetic field frozen - in a perfectly conducting matter imparts to stellar material a supplementary portion of elasticity ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1961 ) , and taking into account formal similarity between equations of classical elastodynamics and magneto - solid - mechanics , it has been conjectured that material displacements in a neutron star undergoing node - free oscillations restored by lorentz force of magnetic field stresses should have one and the same form as those for a solid star executing nodeless spheroidal and torsional shear oscillations restored by hooke s elastic force of solid - mechanical stresses whose frequency spectra has early been computed in ( bastrukov et al 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "following this line of argument it has been shown that this suggestion and the energy variational method of magneto - solid - mechanical theory allow one to get exact spectral formulae for the frequencies of the node - free poloidal and toroidal @xmath2-modes in neutron stars .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss application of magneto - solid - mechanical theory of alfvn oscillations developed in ( bastrukov et al 2009b ) to the white dwarf asteroseismology .",
    "the material of this wide class of pulsating solid stars is identified with a metal - like solid - state plasma composed of ions suspended in the degenerate fermi - gas of relativistic electrons .",
    "therefore if one assume that all pulsating white dwarfs , both magnetic and non - magnetic , come into existence with frozen - in magnetic fields , then there seems to be no theoretical reason why the phenomenon of alfvn vibrations should not occur in these stars . to the best of our knowledge , the possibility that magnetic da and db white dwarfs endowed with poloidal magnetic fields ( having dipolar - like external configuration ) are capable of maintaining alfvn oscillations has profoundly been discussed some time ago by lou ( 1995 ) who was the first to present quite convincing arguments that global alfvn oscillations , entrapped in the entire volume of white dwarf , can be self - excited via @xmath3-mechanism of ionization ( of hydrogen in da and helium in db stars ) , that is , by one and the same mechanism which is responsible of excitation in white dwarfs of @xmath4-modes ( winget 1998 , hansen , kawaler and trimble 2004 , fontain and brassard 2008 , winget and kepler 2008 ) .    adhering to this line of argument , in this article",
    "we investigate peculiarities of lorentz - force - driven global spheroidal and torsional nodeless vibrations of a solid star with frozen - in purely toroidal and completely intrinsic magnetic field @xmath5 $ ] and discuss expected observational consequences of node - free poloidal and toroidal alfvn oscillations in non - magnetic white dwarfs endowed with toroidal magnetic field completely buried beneath its surface .",

    "@xmath14 the practical usefulness of such models is that their inferences can be utilized in the asteroseismology of wide class of pulsating non - magnetic white dwarfs if we are to understand the impact of toroidal magnetic field , entrapped in the volume of the star , on seismic vibrations restored by lorentz force of magnetic field stresses and to identify characteristic spectral features of these vibrations in the detected qpos of x - ray and optical emission from these stars .",

    "the net outcome of these studies is that the presence of such a field can significantly modify the frequencies of spheroidal non - radial nodeless oscillations such as in kelvin fundamental mode ( bastrukov et al 2009c ) . in the meantime",
