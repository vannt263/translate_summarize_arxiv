    "in the early 1980 s , the widely accepted theorical interpretation of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) phenomenon @xcite was formulated around the antithesis between a new form of quantum fluid respresented by the celebrated jastrow - laughlin wave function @xcite and the pinned hartree - fock wigner crystal ( hfwc ) described in the work of fukuyama and lee @xcite and maki and zotos .",
    "@xcite in the above , the wigner - crystal ( wc ) phase has been described @xcite by broken - symmetry variational wave functions which differ from those used for the quantum liquid .",
    "@xcite    the seminal paper by laughlin @xcite pointed to two key aspects in favor of the `` quantum - fluid '' interpretation :    \\(i ) the energy per particle of the hfwc varied smoothly with the filling factor @xmath4 in contrast to the experiment .",
    "however , laughlin s wave function corresponded naturally to the major fractional fillings @xmath5 $ ] that were observed experimentally [ as a result of the conservation of its total angular momentum @xmath6 .",
    "\\(ii ) the energy per particle ( extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit @xmath7 ) of the laughlin - liquid state was substantially lower than that of the wigner crystal at @xmath0 . in the context of the major fractions , a crossover @xcite to a wigner - crystal ground state @xcite",
    "was calculated to occur only for smaller fractional fillings ; initially the onset of wigner - solid ground states had been estimated to occur for fillings @xmath8 , while later studies @xcite predicted crossover already for @xmath9 .    based on the above studies , signatures of the wigner crystal",
    "were expected to appear naturally in the range of smaller filling factors , and indeed over the last two decades experimental studies of the wigner crystal in the lowest landau level ( lll ) seemed to validate the above crossover prediction .",
    "@xcite furthermore this crossover behavior between liquid ( larger major fractions ) and crystal ( smaller major fractions ) was also in agreement with the composite fermion ( cf ) approach for the liquid states , @xcite including the modifications of the hf wigner crystal referred to as composite fermion wigner crystals .",
