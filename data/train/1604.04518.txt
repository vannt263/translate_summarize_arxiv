    "there has been an increased interest recently in the study of how a chiral imbalance of right - handed and left - handed quarks can influence the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "there are many good reasons for this interest .",
    "for instance , the nontrivial nature of the vacuum of non - abelian gauge theories in general , and of qcd in particular , allows for the existence of topological solutions like instantons and sphalerons . while instantons describe the quantum tunneling between different vacua , sphalerons are classical solutions describing transitions going above the barrier between the vacua .",
    "sphaleron processes are unsuppressed at high temperatures  @xcite and , from the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly , they can generate , in the context of qcd , an asymmetry between the number of left- and right - handed quarks .",
    "such a chirality imbalance is expected to occur in event - by - event @xmath0 and @xmath1violating processes in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . moreover , in off - central collisions a magnetic field is created and the presence of a chiral imbalance gives rise to an electric current along the magnetic field , whose effect is to produce a charge separation , an effect dubbed chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) in the literature see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews and references therein .",
    "the cme effect is not restricted to qcd , it extends over a wide range of systems , e.g. , hydrodynamics and condensed matter systems  @xcite , and it has been actually observed in many recent condensed matter experiments  @xcite , which makes it of much wider interest in physics .",
    "the effects of a chiral imbalance in the phase diagram of qcd can be studied in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a chiral chemical potential @xmath2 through a term @xmath3 in the qcd lagrangian density  @xcite . besides of the intrinsic motivation in the context of the physics of heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "there have been interesting suggestions  @xcite that the phase diagram of qcd in the @xmath4 plane could be in principle mapped into the real phase diagram in the @xmath5 plane , where @xmath6 is the usual quark baryon chemical potential , a feature that would help to pinpoint the expected critical end point ( cep ) of qcd see refs .",
    "@xcite for opposite views .",
    "more important , however , is the fact that qcd in the presence of a chiral chemical potential is free from the sign problem and , therefore , amenable to monte carlo sampling in lattice simulations , contrary to the case of qcd in the presence of a baryon chemical potential , which has the sign problem .",
    "hence , there is hope that lattice simulations of qcd with @xmath2 can be used as a possible benchmark platform for comparing different effective models used in the literature . in this respect , it is intriguing that models that have been very successful in describing many features predicted by universality arguments and lattice simulations for the chiral transition in qcd at nonzero @xmath7 and @xmath6 , have difficulties in reproducing , even at a qualitative level , recent lattice results  @xcite for the chiral critical transition temperature @xmath8 at finite  @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , predictions based on nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl)-type of models  @xcite and quark linear sigma models  @xcite find that @xmath8 decreases with  @xmath2 , while the lattice results of refs .  @xcite find @xmath8 increasing with  @xmath2 .",
    "a nonzero quark condensate mixes right- and left - handed quarks and has the effect of decreasing the chiral asymmetry .",
    "therefore , as one forces a system to increase the right - left asymmetry by increasing @xmath2 , one expects that the quark condensate will increase and , therefore , @xmath8 is expected to increase likewise .",
    "this is because addition of left- and right - handed quarks to a system , in amounts controlled by @xmath2 , favors quark - antiquark pairing , that is , increases the quark condensate  @xcite .",
    "universality arguments in the large @xmath9 limit ( where @xmath9 is the number of color degrees of freedom )  @xcite also predict a @xmath8 increasing with  @xmath2 .",
    "some recent studies using phenomenological quark - gluon interactions in the framework of the dyson - schwinger equations for the quark propagator  @xcite and nonlocal finite - range njl models  @xcite find a @xmath8 increasing with @xmath2 .",
    "both types of models have in common the feature of having a momentum - dependent quark mass function , in contrast to a constant mass in contact - interaction models .",
    "a qualitative agreement with the lattice results for @xmath8 was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using a nonstandard renormalization scheme in the quark linear sigma model .",
    "given the prominent role played by njl type of models in providing insight into the problem of the chiral phase transition , it is important to identify the sources of their failure in reproducing the qualitative features of lattice simulations for the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath8 . in the present work we pursue such a study .",
    "our analysis is based on a proper separation of medium effects from divergent integrals , so that all divergent integrals are the same as those that appear in vacuum , i.e. , at @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is motivated by a similar situation in studies of color superconductivity with njl models , in that the traditional treatment based on cutoff regularization leads to a decreasing superconducting gap for high @xmath6 , while the separation of vacuum effects from @xmath6-dependent divergent integrals leads to results in agreement with model - independent predictions  @xcite .",
    "we show that a similar effect is at play here , since  @xmath2 appears explicitly in divergent integrals . as such ,",
    "a decreasing @xmath8 with @xmath2 seems to be a result of improper separation of medium effects from the vacuum contributions , thus subject to a dependence on how these divergent terms are regularized .",
    "this is also similar to the case of magnetized quark matter , where unphysical spurious effects are eliminated by properly disentangling the magnetic field contributions from divergent integrals  @xcite .",
    "our regularization procedure in expressing all divergent integrals in terms of integrals that appear in the vacuum is very simple and , once the divergent vacuum integrals are fixed to reproduce physical quantities in vacuum , our results predict an increasing @xmath8 with @xmath2 .",
    "this result is a simple consequence of the ability of writing all divergent integrals in terms of integrals that appear in the vacuum .",
    "although we use a njl model see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews and references as an explicit example , the procedure applies equally well for other effective models for qcd , like the polyakov  nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model  @xcite that includes the polyakov loop contribution .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "( [ ident ] ) , medium and vacuum dependences can be explicitly disentangled from the integrands of the divergent integrals and , therefore , do not get cutoff by any regulator . in the rest of this work",
    "we refer to this regularization procedure as `` medium separation scheme '' ( mss ) , while the usual treatment of the divergent integrals as `` traditional regularization scheme '' ( trs ) .",
    "earlier works that have applied trs in different effective models of qcd  @xcite have found a critical temperature @xmath8 for chiral symmetry restoration that decreases with @xmath2 . they also find a cep on the phase diagram @xmath37 .",
    "recent lattice results  @xcite obtained instead a @xmath8 increasing with @xmath2 and a transition that is only a crossover . the idea behind the mss method",
    "is not new  @xcite , as already mentioned , it was used previously in a similar situation that occurs with the njl in the study of color superconductivity  @xcite , and it actually resembles  @xcite the bogoliubov , parasiuk , hepp , zimmermann renormalization scheme  @xcite , in that the integrand of a divergent amplitude is manipulated to isolate the divergence without applying an explicit regulator .",
    "the dynamical quark mass @xmath27 is determined self - consistently by solving the gap equation derived from eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) which , with the help of eq .",

    "we fix the parameters of the model by using as input @xmath49  mev , @xmath50  gev and @xmath51 gev , and use a three - dimensional cutoff to evaluate the vacuum divergent integrals .",

    "the results at a fixed temperature ( below the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration ) are qualitatively similar .",
    "we show the results for both the trs and mss regularizations explained above . here",
    "a note of caution is in order regarding values of @xmath2 close to @xmath36 .",
    "one should keep in mind that the njl model , being a nonrenormalizable model , has an intrinsic energy scale and its predictions of phenomena driven by dynamics occurring at energies higher than that scale should be taken with great caution . although the precise limit of validity can be a matter of discussion , as it might depend on type of observable or physical process at study , the value for that scale is commonly assumed in the literature to be the cutoff  @xmath36 . in view of this and in order to avoid misinterpretations , we have restricted the value of @xmath2 in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] to be at most @xmath36 .",
    "note that even though the trs scheme seems to indicate that the chiral chemical potential initially strengthens dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) , the behavior changes at around @xmath58 , beyond which it starts to disfavor dcsb .",
    "however , in the mss scheme , dcsb is always strengthened by the chiral chemical potential ; with all the required proviso just mentioned , we remark that this continues to be true for values of @xmath2 larger than @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we see that in the trs regularization , the tendency of the chiral chemical potential is to weaken the chiral symmetry breaking beyond @xmath59 , while in the mss regularization the tendency is always to strengthen it .",
    "this change of behavior , which is directly related on how the vacuum dependent term on @xmath2 is handled , of course reflects on how the critical temperature changes too .",
    "this is explicitly shown in fig .",

    "the black dot indicates a tricritical point in the chiral limit , while the square indicates the critical end point , both in the trs regularization case ( see text for a detailed explanation ) . ]",
    "the values of @xmath61 , for the critical ( @xmath8 ) and pseudo - critical ( @xmath62 ) temperatures for chiral symmetry restoration evaluated at @xmath11 used in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show the results for the critical temperature @xmath8 as a function of @xmath2 for the two forms of treating the divergent integrals . in the trs regularization , we find a critical end point ( cep ) that separates a crossover line from a first - order transition . in the chiral limit ( @xmath15 ) it is instead a tricritical point ( tp ) , which separates a line of second - order phase transition from one of first - order .",
    "however , in the mss regularization both the tp and the cep are absent .",
    "the transition is a crossover ( note that in this case @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicates , technically , the pseudo - critical temperature ) , while in the chiral limit the transition is second order throughout . in conformity with the behavior seen for the dynamical quark mass in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , because of the deleterious effect of the chiral chemical potential on the breaking of chiral symmetry , @xmath8 decreases in the trs regularization .",
    "but in the mss regularization one sees that @xmath8 always increases with @xmath2 .",
    "this is in qualitative accordance with the recent results from the lattice  @xcite and also with more sophisticated nonperturbative treatments , e.g. , like the ones used in refs .",
    "as far the absence of the tp ( in the chiral limit ) or the cep in the mss regularization is concerned , this is also seen in the results obtained from the earlier lattice results  @xcite and also with the more recent ones , where no cep ( or tp ) has been found .",
    "one should , however , mention here that the lattice results in refs .",
    "@xcite should be taken with some caution , as they were obtained for a very large pion mass , @xmath63 mev , while here we used the physical value of @xmath64 mev .",
    "it is known that some quantities ( for example the behavior of the quark condensate as a function of an external magnetic field ) may depend heavily on the pion mass .",
    "so we can not ruled out the possibility that the nonexistence of a cep in those lattice results could be an artifact of the large pion masses used in those numerical studies .",
    "the increase of the pseudo - critical and the critical ( in the chiral limit ) temperatures are again consistent with the behavior seen for the dynamical quark mass in the mss regularization shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "finally , as already remarked , being the njl model an effective model , it has an intrinsic scale that limits its validity .",
    "a natural choice for this scale can be taken for example as being the regularization or cutoff scale in the present case , @xmath36 , and we do expect that the results should be reliable for values of @xmath2 not too above this scale .",
    "we note from the results of both figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] that the differences between the trs and mss regularization schemes are already significant for values of @xmath65 .",
    "in particular , the differences between the ( pseudo- ) critical temperature @xmath8 in the trs and mss schemes are already apparent for values of @xmath2 as low as around @xmath66 , where the tendency of growth for @xmath8 is already clear .",
    "our results show that a way of conciliating results for the chiral critical transition line obtained with njl models and recent lattice results , when in the presence of a chiral imbalance , might be closely connected on how the uv momentum integrals are treated in these models . these same results also show that one can eliminate this discrepancy by a proper separation of medium effects from the integrand of the divergent integrals that require regularization .",
    "all resulting divergent integrals are the same as those that appear in the vacuum , i.e. , at @xmath10 and @xmath11 . by this proper separation of medium effects from the divergent vacuum integrals",
    ", we have obtained results for the critical temperature dependence with the chiral chemical potential that are in qualitative agreement with physical expectations , in that @xmath2 is a catalyst of dcsb  @xcite and , therefore , an increasing critical temperature as a function of @xmath2 should be expected . moreover , our results are in line with the arguments of ref .  @xcite that the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath36 , used with a trs , effectively cuts important degrees of freedom near the fermi surface leading to an incorrect result for the critical temperature as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we also have qualitative agreement with lattice results regarding the absence of a cep .",
    "note , however , as we have already remarked , the comparison should be taken with caution , given the large pion mass used in those lattice studies .",
    "likewise , the position and even ( non)existence and of a cep can depend heavily on the pion mass .",
    "nevertheless , we must also point out that recent studies  @xcite based on a renormalizable , nonperturbative scheme based on the dyson - schwinger equations of qcd also do not find a critical end point in the phase diagram @xmath67see also discussions in ref .",
    "while definite lattice results with physical pions masses are still missing , it is fair to say that there is strong evidence that there is no cep in the phase diagram of quark matter with a chiral imbalance . in the mss regularization",
    ", we found that the transition is a crossover in the physical case of @xmath68 , while in the chiral limit , @xmath69 , it is second - order throughout .",
    "one additional bonus of properly separating medium effects from divergent vacuum momentum integrals , is the fact that once the parameters of the model are chosen to fit physical quantities in vacuum , the divergent integrals are fixed and they are not changed when studying @xmath7 and @xmath2 effects .",
    "this is simply a consequence of making the uv divergent momentum integrals , @xmath39 and @xmath43 , to depend only on vacuum quantities .",
    "thus , in the present case where we have chosen a three - dimensional momentum cutoff @xmath36 for the uv divergent integrals , both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are fixed once the values of @xmath36 and @xmath34 are fitted to the physical quantities . even though arguments can be made against such a separation of vacuum and medium effects in the njl model",
    ", we believe that in some cases , such a strategy , in the present case given by the mss regularization scheme , seems to be important for capturing the right physics with the model .",
    "though we have offered arguments in favor of the mss procedure , it is clear that more work is welcome , in particular , more work on different regulators is needed .",
    "we believe that this same methodology that we have employed in this work will also be relevant in any other problem where this mixing of medium and regularization might be present .",
    "our results , thus , indicate a way of improving the predictibility of these effective models , which are so useful in our effort to explain one of the most difficult problems in physics today , i.e. , the structure of the qcd phase diagram .",

    "<S> we show how a scheme of rewriting a divergent momentum integral can conciliate results obtained with the nambu  jona - lasinio model and recent lattice results for the chiral transition in the presence of a chiral imbalance in quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> purely vacuum contributions are separated from medium - dependent regularized momentum integrals in such a way that one is left with ultraviolet divergent momentum integrals that depend on vacuum quantities only . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is applicable to other commonly used effective models to study quark matter with a chiral imbalance , it allows us to identify the source of their difficulties in reproducing the qualitative features of lattice results , and enhances their predictability and uses in other applications . </S>"
