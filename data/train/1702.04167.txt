    "the formation and condensation of excitonic bound states of conduction - band electrons and valence - band holes belongs surely to one of the most exciting ideas of contemporary solid state physics .",
    "although the excitonic condensation has been predicted a long time ago  @xcite , no conclusive experimental proof of its existence has been achieved yet .",
    "the latest experimental studies of materials with strong electronic correlations showed however , that there are a few promising candidates for the experimental verification of the excitonic condensation .",
    "the first one is the mixed valence compound @xmath4 , where detailed studies of the pressure - induced semiconductor - semimetal transition indicate that excitons are created in a large number and condense below 20  k  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) state observed in the layered transition - metal dichalcogenide @xmath5 was claimed to be of excitonic origin  @xcite .",
    "quite recently , as a further candidate for the excitonic state , a quasi one - dimensional system @xmath6 has raised and attracted much experimental attention  @xcite . in this material",
    "the flat band was observed by the arpes experiment , which was interpreted to be due to excitonic condensation .",
    "these results have stimulated further experimental and theoretical studies with regard to the formation and possible condensation of excitonic bound states of electron and holes in correlated systems . at present",
    ", it is generally accepted that the minimal theoretical model for a description of excitonic correlations in these material could be the falicov - kimball model  @xcite and its extensions  @xcite . in its original form ,",
    "the falicov - kimball model describes a two - band system of the itinerant @xmath7 electrons ( with the nearest - neighbor @xmath7-electron hopping constant @xmath8 ) and the localized @xmath0 electrons that interact only via a local @xmath0-@xmath7 coulomb interaction @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation and annihilation operators of spinless electrons in the @xmath13 orbital at site @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the position of the @xmath0-level energy . in what follows",
    "we consider @xmath16 and all energies are measured in units of @xmath8 .    since the local @xmath0-electron number @xmath17",
    "is strictly conserved quantity , the @xmath7-@xmath0 electron coherence can not be established in this model . this shortcoming can be overcome by including an explicit local hybridization @xmath18 between the @xmath7 and @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "however , the hybridization between @xmath7 and @xmath0 orbitals is not the only way to develop @xmath7-@xmath0 coherence .",
    "analytical and numerical studies of batista et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a finite @xmath0-electron bandwidth @xmath19 also induces @xmath7-@xmath0 coherence , and thus it can lead to an excitonic condensate even in the absence of direct @xmath7-@xmath0 hybridization .",
    "later this model has been used extensively to describe different phases in the ground state and specially properties of the excitonic phase  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the ground state phase diagram exhibits very simple structure consisting of only four phases , and namely , the full @xmath7 and @xmath0 band insulator , the excitonic insulator , the cdw and the staggered orbital order .",
    "the excitonic insulator is characterized by a nonvanishing @xmath20 average .",
    "the cdw is described by a periodic modulation in the total electron density of both @xmath0 and @xmath7 electrons , and the staggered orbital order is characterized by a periodic modulation in the difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath7 electron densities .",
    "an extension of this model with local hybridization between the @xmath0 and @xmath7 orbitals has been studied very recently in our work  @xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis of the excitonic momentum distribution @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 , where l denotes the number of lattice sites ) showed that this quantity diverges for @xmath23 , signalizing a bose - einstein condensation of preformed excitons .",
    "moreover , it was found that the density of zero momentum excitons @xmath24 ( as well as the total exciton density @xmath25 ) depends strongly on the values of the coulomb interaction @xmath9 and that already for relatively small values of @xmath9 ( @xmath26 ) the significant fraction of @xmath27 excitons is in the zero - momentum state .    in the current paper",
    "we examine in detail how robust is the excitonic state against the changes of other model parameters . in particular , we consider effects of the non - zero f - electron hopping @xmath28 , the non - local hybridization @xmath29 and the increasing dimension of the system , which together , but also separately model more realistically the physical situation in real rare - earth compounds than the model considered in our previous paper ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the crucial role of these factors in a correct description of ground state properties of these materials has been already confirmed by previous analytical and numerical studies .",
    "indeed , it was found , that the f - band ( f - electron hopping ) of the opposite parity than the d - band , stabilizes the excitonic phase , but only in the dimension @xmath32",
    "@xcite , while the nonlocal hybridization ( in the mean - field approximation ) fully destroys the excitonic phase  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the comfirmation ( refutation ) of the last result by exact calculations is of crucial importance for a correct description of ground states properties of some rare earth systems and especially the mixed valence compounds , like @xmath33  @xcite . in these materials",
    "the local hybridization is forbidden and only the nonlocal one ( with inversion symmetry ) between the nearest - neighbour f and d orbitals , is allowed  @xcite . on the base of the above mentioned facts we expect the strong effects of these factors also on the formation and condensation of the excitonic bound states .",
    "besides these factors , we examine also the influence of the f - level position on the density of @xmath34 excitons , since the simple parametrization between the f - level position and external pressure @xmath35 , widely used in the literature  @xcite allows us to predict , at least qualitatively , the behaviour of this quantity with the external pressure .",
    "to examine effects of the above mentioned factors on the formation and condensation of excitonic bound states in the generalized falicov - kimball model we have performed exhaustive dmrg studies of the model hamiltonian @xmath36 for a wide range of the model parameters at the total electron density @xmath37 . in",
    "all examined cases we typically keep up to 500 states per block , although in the numerically more difficult cases , where the dmrg results converge slower , we keep up to 1000 states .",
    "truncation errors  @xcite , given by the sum of the density matrix eigenvalues of the discarded states , vary from @xmath38 in the worse cases to zero in the best cases .       and the total exciton density @xmath39 as functions of local hybridization @xmath40 calculated by dmrg method for three different values of the interband coulomb interaction @xmath9 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "b ) @xmath42 and @xmath39 as functions of @xmath3 calculated for three different values of @xmath9 ( @xmath43).,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   and the total exciton density @xmath39 as functions of local hybridization @xmath40 calculated by dmrg method for three different values of the interband coulomb interaction @xmath9 ( @xmath41 ) .",

    "1a shows the bahaviour of the density of zero momentum excitons @xmath42 as a function of local hybridization @xmath40 for several values of the interband coulomb interaction @xmath9 .",
    "one can see that both , the local interband hybridization @xmath40 as well as the local coulomb interaction @xmath9 strongly support the condensation of preformed excitons to the zero - momentum state . in all examined cases",
    "the density of zero momentum excitons @xmath42 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath40 which character changes obviously at some critical value of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 , with @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath45 , with @xmath48 for @xmath49 ) .",
    "comparing these results with ones obtained in our previous paper for the phase boundary between the cdw and homogeneous phase  @xcite , the origin of this different behaviour is obvious . while below @xmath50 the excitonic phase coexists with the @xmath51 phase , above @xmath50 it coexists with the homogeneous one , what leads to a different power law behaviour of @xmath42 for @xmath47 and @xmath49 . unlike @xmath42 , the total exciton density @xmath39 depends only very weakly on @xmath40 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "1a ) indicating that the formation of excitons is primarily driven by the interband coulomb interaction @xmath9 .    with regard to the situation in real materials , where always exists a finite overlap of @xmath0 orbitals on neighbouring sites , it is more interesting to ask what happens in the case when a finite @xmath0 bandwidth will be considered . in accordance with some previous theoretical studies , which documented strong effects of the parity of @xmath0 band on the stability of the excitonic phase  @xcite",
    "we have examined the model for both , the positive ( the even parity ) and negative ( the odd parity ) values of the @xmath0-electron hopping integrals @xmath3 .",
    "the results of our non - zero @xmath3 dmrg calculations for @xmath42 are displayed in fig .",
    "1b and they clearly demonstrate that the zero - momentum condensate is suppressed in the limit of positive values of @xmath3 , while it remains robust for negative values of @xmath3 . this result is intuitively expected since our previous hartree - fock ( hf ) results  @xcite showed that only the negative values of @xmath3 stabilize the ferroelectric phase , while the positive ones stabilize the antiferroelectric phase .",
    "the effect of @xmath3 is especially strong for @xmath9 small , where continuous but very steep changes of @xmath42 are observed for @xmath52 .",
    "contrary to this , the total exciton density @xmath39 exhibits only a weak dependence on the @xmath0-electron hopping parameter @xmath3 , over the whole interval of @xmath3 values .",
    "till now we have presented results exclusively for @xmath53 .",
    "let as now discuss briefly the effect of change of the @xmath0-level position .",
    "this study is interesting also from this point of view that taking into account the parametrization between the external pressure and the position of the @xmath0 level ( @xmath54 ) , one can deduce from the @xmath15 dependences of the ground state characteristics also their @xmath55 dependences , at least qualitatively  @xcite .",
    "the resultant @xmath15 dependences of the density of zero momentum excitons @xmath42 obtained by dmrg method are shown in fig .",
    "2a for several values of @xmath40 and @xmath56 .     as a function of @xmath15 calculated by dmrg method for three different values of @xmath40 ( @xmath57 ) .",

    "the inset shows the behaviour of @xmath42 and @xmath39 near @xmath64.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    one can see that the density of zero momentum excitons is nonzero over the whole interval of @xmath15 values .",
    "moreover , we have found that the values of @xmath42 are extremely enhanced in the region near @xmath65 , what is obviously due to the significant enhancement of the @xmath7 electron population in the @xmath7 band ( see the inset in fig .",
    "2a ) .    to describe , in more detail , the process of formation of excitonic bound states with increasing @xmath15 , we have plotted in fig .  2b ,",
    "besides the density od zero momentum excitons @xmath42 , also the total exciton density @xmath39 , the total @xmath7-electron density @xmath58 and the total density of unbond @xmath7 electrons @xmath61",
    ". it is seen ( see the inset in fig .",
    "2b ) that below @xmath66 , @xmath42 and @xmath39 coincides what means that the excitonic insulator in this region is practically completely driven by the condensation of zero - momentum excitons . above this value @xmath39 starts to increase sharply , while @xmath42 tends to its maximum at @xmath67 and then gradualy decreases to its minimum at @xmath53 .",
    "similar behaviour with increasing @xmath15 exhibits also the density of unbond @xmath7 electrons @xmath68 , however the values of @xmath68 are several times larger than @xmath42 .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the total exciton density @xmath39 inreases over the whole interval of @xmath15 values , the number of unbond @xmath7 electrns remains practically uchanged over the wide range of @xmath15 values ( from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) , since its decrease , due to the formation of excitonic pairs , is compensated by the increase of @xmath71 .",
    "thus we can conclude that in the pressure induced case , when the @xmath0-level energy shifts up with applied pressure  @xcite , the model is able to describe , at least qualitatively , the increase in the total density of excitons with external pressure and the increase or decrease ( according to the initial position of @xmath15 at ambient pressure ) in the @xmath42 and @xmath68 .",
    "as already mentioned , physically the most interesting case corresponds however to @xmath72 .",
    "the importance of this term emphasizes the fact that the on - site hybridization @xmath40 is actually forbidden in real @xmath7-@xmath0 systems for parity reasons .",
    "istead the on - site hybridization , one has to consider in these materials the non - local hybridization with inversion symmetry @xmath73 that leads to @xmath74-dependent hybridization of the opposite parity than corresponds to the @xmath7 band ( @xmath75 )  @xcite . a straightforward extension of the one - dimensional results to two dimensions yields @xmath76 $ ] , where any site on the lattice is given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the lattice constant .",
    "typical examples of @xmath79 dependence of the excitonic momentum distribution @xmath80 obtained for three representative values of the interband coulomb interaction and two values of @xmath0-electron hopping in the one dimension are displayed in fig .",
    "3a and fig .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   as a function of @xmath79 calculated by dmrg method for three different values of @xmath9 and two different values of @xmath3 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    these results clearly demonstrate that there is no sign of divergence in the @xmath79-dependence of @xmath82 neither for @xmath83 nor for @xmath84 and thus there is no signal of forming the bose - einstein condensate in the presence of non - local hybridization with the inversion symmetry . on the base of these results",
    "we can conclude that possible candidates for the appearance of the bose - einstein condensation of excitons in real @xmath7-@xmath0 materials , are only systems with local hybridization that supports the formation of the bose - einstein condensate , but not systems with non - local hybridization ( of the inversion symmetry ) , what strongly limits the class of materials , where this phenomenon could be observed . on the other hand , it should be noted that although the local hybridization is forbidden in real @xmath7-@xmath0 electron systems , there is still a possibility to induce a finite local hybridization by some additional , not fully electronic mechanisms .",
    "such an additional mechanism could be , for example , the electron - phonon interaction @xmath85 .",
    "as shown by menezes at al .",
    "@xcite such an interaction can be reduced to the phonon - mediated local hybridization that can also lead to the formation of bose - einstein condensate under the supposition that it will be sufficiently strong , what depends on values of electron - phonon constants .      since not all of the above mentioned candidates are the one - dimensional or quasi one - dimensional systems , it is interesting to ask if the above obtained results persist also in higher dimensions .",
    "unfortunately , the dmrg method is not a very convenient tool for the study of lattice systems in @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to choose another method that should be able to describe sufficiently precise the excitonic effects in @xmath7-@xmath0 systems . from this point of view",
    "a very promising method seems to be the hf approximation with the cdw instability .",
    "indeed , we have showed in our previous paper  @xcite , that this method is able to describe almost perfectly the ground - state phase diagram of the extended falicov - kimball model in @xmath86 , including the existence of excitonic phase .",
    "let us briefly summarize the basic steps of this approximation . in the presence of cdw instability , the order parameters can be written as follows  @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the order parameters of the cdw state for the @xmath7- and @xmath0-electrons , @xmath90 is the excitonic average and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is the nesting vector for @xmath93 ( @xmath86 ) .          with @xmath98 and the corresponding dispersions @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "are obtained by the fourier transform of the @xmath7/@xmath0-electron hopping amplitudes and the local / nonlocal hybridization",
    ". then the hf parameters @xmath102 and the density of zero - momentum excitons @xmath42 can be expressed directly in terms of the bogoliubov - de gennes eigenvectors @xmath103  @xcite .    to verify the ability of this method to describe the formation of the bose - einstein condensate we have calculated firstly the density of the zero momentum excitons as functions of model parameters @xmath104 and @xmath15 for the one dimensional case .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations are displayed in fig  4 ( the left panels ) and they show that the hf approximation with the cdw instability is able to decribe all aspects of formation of zero - momentum condensate in @xmath93 discussed above within the dmrg method .",
    "although , there are some small qualitative as well as quantitative differences , like the discontinuous changes of @xmath42 with @xmath3 near @xmath83 , or almost two times larger values of @xmath50 in comparison to dmrg studies ( see the inset in the a ) panel ) , in principle , the dmrg and hf pictures are same . in accordance with dmrg results we have found a strong enhancement of @xmath42 near @xmath105 also in the hf solutions . performing the numerical derivative of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath15 and comparing it with the behaviour of @xmath106 one can easily verify ( see the instet in the e ) panel ) that this enhancement is indeed connected with changes in the occupation of @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) orbitals as conjectured above on the base of @xmath107 results .     as a function of @xmath108 calculated by hf approximation with the @xmath51 instability in the one ( the left panels ) and two dimensions ( the right panels ) .",
