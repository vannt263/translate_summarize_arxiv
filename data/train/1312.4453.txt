    "spacetime singularities are believed to be one of the inevitable consequences of the einstein s theory of relativity .",

    "another intriguing one is the big - bang - like cosmological singularities . according to the classical singularity classification devised by ellis and schmidt 1 , curvature singularities",
    "can be grouped as _ scalar _ and _ nonscalar . _",
    "the _ _  scalar _ _ curvature _ _  _ _ singularities are the strongest ones in the sense that the spacetime becomes inextendible and all the physical quantities , such as the gravitational field , energy density and tidal forces , diverge at the singular point .",
    "singularities forming at the centre of black holes and in some colliding plane wave spacetimes are good examples for strong _ scalar _ curvature singularity . in black hole",
    "spacetimes singularities located at the centre ( @xmath2 ) is hidden by horizon(s ) . in the cases where this singularity is not hidden ,",
    "it is called the _ naked _ singularity .",
    "whereas , the singularity occurring in the interaction region of bell - szekeres solution @xcite which describes the nonlinear interaction of electromagnetic plane waves can be given as an example to _ nonscalar _ curvature singularity .",
    "naked singularity which is visible from outside needs further care as far as the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis is concerned .",
    "it is beleived that , naked singularity forms a threat to this hypothesis . hence ,",
    "understanding and the resolution of naked singularities seems to be extremely important for the deterministic nature of general relativity .",
    "however , the scale where the singularities are forming is very small ( smaller than the planck scale ) , so that the classical general relativity methods in the resolution of the singularities are expected to be replaced by the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "unfortunately , there is no consistent quantum theory of gravity yet .",
    "since this theory is still `` under construction '' , the alternative methods in healing the singularities are always attracted the attentions .",
    "string theory @xciteand loop quantum gravity @xcite constitutes two major study fields in resolving singularities .",
    "it is shown in string theory that some timelike singularities are resolved : the orbifold , the flop , and the conifold .",
    "the flop and the conifold occurs in the calabi - yau manifolds in which their resolution involves the use of light matters such as `` twisted sectors '' and `` wrapped d - branes '' @xcite(and references therein ) .",
    "a rather different approach is considered in @xcite  for resolving the timelike singularities in reissner - nordstrm and negative mass schwarzschild solutions . in this approach",
    ", the spacetime is viewed as being made of two parts which are naturally connected across the singularity . in this study",
    ", it is shown that the reissner - nordstrm singularity allows for communication through the singularity and can be termed as `` beam splitter '' since the transmission probability of a suitably prepared high energy wave packet is 25% .",
    "another alternative method ; following the work of wald @xcite , is proposed by horowitz and marolf ( hm)@xcite , which incorporates `` self - adjointness '' of the spatial part of the wave operator .",
    "hence , the classical notion of _ geodesics incompleteness _ with respect to point - particle probe will be replaced by the notion of _ quantum singularity _ with respect to wave probes .",
    "the method of hm has been used successfully for other spacetimes to check whether the classically singular spacetimes are quantum mechanically regular or not . as an example ; negative mass schwarzschild spacetime , charged dilatonic black hole spacetime and fundamental string spacetimes are considered in @xcite .",
