    "understanding of the asymptotics of hadronic scattering amplitudes at high energy @xmath0 and fixed transferred momentum @xmath1 still remains an important challenge to perturbative qcd .",
    "one of the main difficulties stems from the fact that in this limit one should expect the emergence of a new regime of qcd @xcite , in which , in accordance with the regge model expectations , partons ( quarks and gluons ) as elementary excitations are replaced by new collective degrees of freedom ",
    "regge poles , among which the two families  reggeons and pomerons with the quantum numbers of gluons and vacuum , respectively , should play a special role providing the leading asymptotic behaviour of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the previous attempts to solve the problem in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , have led to the discovery of the bfkl formalism @xcite .",
    "it was found that the gluon is reggeized in the lla and the qcd pomeron appears in this approximation as a compound state of two reggeized gluons . at high energy and",
    "fixed transferred momentum , @xmath1 , the contribution of the reggeized gluon , or _ reggeon _",
    ", to the scattering amplitude has a form @xmath4 with the reggeon trajectory @xmath5 given in the lla by @xcite _ ( t)-1=(q_^2)=-_sn_c ^-2 + ( _ s^2 ) , t =- q_^2 . since the reggeon carries the color charge of gluon ,",
    "its trajectory is infrared ( ir ) divergent and one applies the dimensional regularization with @xmath6 for @xmath7 and dimensional parameter @xmath8 . at zero",
    "transferred momentum the reggeon trajectory satisfies @xmath9 while for @xmath10 one subtracts ir poles in @xmath11 in the @xmath12 scheme to find the renormalized expression ( q_^2)=-n_c + ( _ s^2 ) .",
    "the dependence on the ir cutoff @xmath8 and ir poles in @xmath11 are cancelled in the color - singlet compound states of the reggeons after one takes into account the interaction between reggeons @xcite",
    ".    however , the lla can not be satisfactory approximation to qcd in the regge limit due to the following reasons .",
    "first , the total cross - sections grow in the lla as powers of the energy @xmath0 violating the unitarity bound .",
    "the nonleading corrections are responsible for the restoration of the unitarity and at the same time they should define the region of energies in which the lla result will be meaningful .",
    "the problem of calculating unitarization corrections is still open and it reveals the intriguing connection of qcd in the regge limit with completely integrable two - dimensional systems .",
    "second , in the lla the scattering amplitudes get equally important contributions from the region of large and small gluon transverse momenta . in order to be able to control nonperturbative effects associated with soft gluons one has to separate the latter contribution from the scattering amplitudes by performing the factorization procedure @xcite . in the lla , this can be done in ( [ kt ] ) by introducing the factorization scale @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and dividing the whole interval of gluon transverse momenta into the regions of `` soft '' momenta , @xmath15 , and `` hard '' momenta , @xmath16 .",
    "these two regions provide the @xmath17dependent additive contributions to the reggeon trajectory and the @xmath17dependence cancels in their sum . beyond the lla , one has to follow the general procedure @xcite in order to obtain the factorized expression for the scattering amplitude , in which the contribution of soft gluons is described by a nonperturbative soft function @xmath18 , while that of hard gluons is absorbed into perturbatively calculable hard function @xmath19 . in an analogy with deep inelastic scattering , one may try to interpret the factorization procedure as some kind of the regge operator product expansion ( ope ) , in which the soft function is associated with the matrix element of local composite operators and the hard function is defined as a coefficient function . having identified the relevant operators , one should try to relate their anomalous dimensions with the properties of the regge trajectories in qcd @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose the ope for the reggeon trajectory and identify the relevant operators as wilson lines .",
    "we establish the evolution equation for the reggeon trajectory and show its close relation to the renormalization properties of the so - called cross singularities of wilson lines .",
    "our approach is closely related to the techniques developed by lipatov @xcite and by botts and sterman @xcite .",
    "recently , the next - to - leading corrections to the bfkl formalism became available @xcite .",
    "in particular , the 2-loop correction to the reggeon trajectory was calculated @xcite and the result can be represented in the following form @xcite @xmath20 with the 1-loop correction @xmath21 defined in ( [ 1-loop ] ) and ^(2)(t)=()^2 n_c ( w_1 l^2 + w_2 l + w_3 ) . here , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the coefficients @xmath24",
    "are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of light quark flavours .",
    "it was observed @xcite that , as a result of nontrivial cancellations between different contributions , the @xmath27 term vanishes in ( [ 2-loop ] ) and the coefficient in front of the @xmath28 term turns out to be proportional to the one - loop @xmath29function . as we will show in sect .  4",
    ", the evolution equation provides a simple understanding of these properties as well as interpretation of the remaining coefficients .",
    "the reggeon trajectory should not depend on the type of the scattered particles . using this property one can simplify the analysis by considering the elastic scattering of two quarks with mass @xmath30 in the regge limit of large energy @xmath31 and fixed transferred momentum @xmath32 . here ,",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are on - shell momenta of incoming and outgoing quarks with the color indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",

    "if one assumes that the gluon is reggeized , then its contribution to the negative signature component @xmath49 of @xmath50 ( or equivalently @xmath44 ) has the following factorized form in the regge kinematics ( [ kin ] ) t_2 ^ -t_2 ( , ) -t_2(- , ) = , where the residue factor @xmath51 measures the coupling of the reggeon to the quark .",
    "the incoming quarks scatter each other by exchanging gluons in the @xmath52channel with the total momentum @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the limit ( [ kin ] ) , quarks behave effectively as heavy particles and the only effect of their interaction with gluons is the appearance of the eikonal phase in the heavy quark wave function .",
    "this phase is given by the wilson line , @xmath55 , evaluated along the classical trajectory @xmath56 of the quark .",

    "@xmath34 one introduces the angle @xmath62 between the quark trajectories as @xmath63 and in the limit ( [ kin ] ) one gets @xmath64 according to ( [ t ] ) , the nontrivial @xmath65dependence of the scattering amplitude comes from the analogous dependence of the vacuum expectation value of the product of two wilson lines w^ij_ij = w^ij_ij(,^2",
    "z^2)= | w_+^ii(0 ) w_-^jj(z)|0 , which in turn is translated into the kinematical dependence of the integration contour on the angle @xmath62 .",
    "the one - loop correction to the wilson line can be easily calculated using the dimensional regularization as @xcite w^ij_ij=_ii_jj+t^a_iit^a_jj ( -i ) ( ) ( ^2 z_^2)^-+(_s^2 ) , where the pole in @xmath66 has an ir origin .",
    "substituting this expression into ( [ t ] ) and performing the fourier transformation one finds that the ir pole disappears and one reproduces the quark - quark scattering amplitude in the born approximation ( t_born)^ij_ij = t^a_iit^a_jj . calculating the quark - quark scattering amplitude to higher orders in @xmath67 one might expect that the feynman integrals over gluon momenta should involve four momentum scales : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath8 . in reality , due to the properties of the wilson lines , the first two scales enter only via the @xmath71dependence and the relevant scales become @xmath8 and @xmath72 .",
    "the first scale provides the ir cutoff for gluon momenta and the second one , @xmath72 , cuts the gluon momenta from above and has a meaning of an uv cutoff @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the factorization scale @xmath13 such that @xmath73 and separate gluon momenta into hard region and soft region .",
    "then , an arbitrary feynman diagram contributing to the wilson line takes a form shown on fig .",

    "the contribution of the hard subprocess depends on the factorization scale @xmath13 and on the large scale @xmath72 while the contribution of the soft subprocess depends on @xmath13 and ir cutoff @xmath8 .",
    "both subprocesses depend also on the angle @xmath62 as well as on the color indices of the scattered quarks .",

    "the soft subprocess @xmath18 describes the coupling of the soft gluons to the wilson lines corresponding to the scattered heavy quarks . inside the hard subprocess",
    "the wilson lines are separated in the transverse plane at the short distance @xmath76 . however , since the transverse momenta of gluons inside s is small , @xmath15 , the soft gluons can not resolve short distances inside h and calculating their contribution one can shrink the hard subprocess into a point at @xmath77 .",
    "notice that at @xmath77 the quark trajectories cross each other at the origin and two different color flows inside the hard subprocess ( [ h ] ) lead to two possible configurations of the wilson lines describing the soft function @xmath18 ( w_1)^ij_ij & = & s^ij;kl_ij;kl = , + ( w_2)^ij_ij & = & s^ij;kl_ij;lk = .",
    "the integration contours entering into these expressions are different only at the vicinity of the cross point and they are shown by solid lines on fig",
    ".  1 .    finally , substituting ( [ h ] ) and ( [ w12 ] ) into ( [ w = hs ] ) we obtain the expression for the wilson line ( [ w ] ) in the form of the operator product expansion w^ij_ij(,^2 z^2 ) = c_1(,z^2 ^2 ) ( w_1)^ij_ij(,^2/^2 ) + c_2(,z^2 ^2 ) ( w_2)^ij_ij(,^2/^2 ) c w , where the notation was introduced for the doublets c=(c_1 ,  c_2 ) , w= ( w_1 w_2 ) .",
    "to one - loop order , the calculation of the coefficient functions and the wilson lines in the @xmath12 scheme gives ( c_1 - 1)n_c =- c_2=-(i ) ( |z_|^-_e/2 ) + ( _ s^2 ) with @xmath78 being the euler constant and w_1=_ii_jj - & & ( i)+(_s^2 ) , + w_2=_ij_ji - & & + ( _ s^2 ) .",

    "states that it can be expanded over two wilson line operators which are still nonlocal in longitudinal plane but local in the transverse direction .",
    "we notice , however , that nonlocality of @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the longitudinal direction can be effectively eliminated if one uses the representation for the wilson lines as correlators of local heavy quark fields in the effective heavy quark field theory @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude ( [ t ] ) and the wilson line ( [ ope ] ) do not depend on an arbitrary factorization scale @xmath13 while the coefficient functions @xmath56 and the wilson lines @xmath82 depend separately on @xmath13 . in a full analogy with the standard ope , the latter dependence can be found using the renormalization properties of the wilson lines @xmath80 and @xmath81 defined in ( [ w12 ] ) and entering into the ope expansion ( [ ope ] ) .",
    "these properties have been studied in details in past @xcite without any relation to the high - energy scattering and they were found to depend on the choice of the integration contours @xmath56 and on the representation of the @xmath46 group in which the wilson lines are defined .",
    "the peculiar features of the wilson lines @xmath80 and @xmath81 are that , first , they are defined in the fundamental ( quark ) representation and , second , the integration contours entering into their definitions cross each other at the origin . as a result , the wilson lines @xmath80 and @xmath81 are mixed with each other under renormalization and their @xmath17dependence is described by the following rg equation @xcite ( + ( g ) + _ cross(,_s ) ) w(,^2/^2)=0 with the doublet @xmath83 defined in ( [ doub ] ) .",
