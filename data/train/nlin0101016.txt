    "in physical systems , noise is unavoidable . thus , it is important to study the effect of noise on models of physical systems .",
    "it has been shown that some models are very sensitive to the presence of noise : for example , the model for the resonant interaction of three wave modes considered in @xcite shows that a tiny amount of noise can replace a bifurcation structure involving a period doubling cascade to chaos with a noisy periodic orbit which is attracting over a wide range of parameter values .",
    "noise can have an especially profound effect on models with structurally stable heteroclinic cycles .",
    "these cycles involve connections between unstable states , and the connections typically occur in invariant subspaces .",
    "even small amounts of noise can cause the system to jump across these subspaces , and this can lead to very different dynamical behavior  @xcite . if such a heteroclinic cycle also is _ attracting _ , the time spent in the neighborhood of the unstable states of the cycle increases without bound with increasing time .",
    "this is not observed in physical systems and noise provides an explanation : the heteroclinic cycle becomes a `` statistical limit cycle '' in which switching between the unstable states of the cycle occurs randomly in time but with a well - defined mean period  @xcite .    in  @xcite , a model of large aspect - ratio binary fluid convection was studied .",
    "the model considers the competition between two nearly degenerate modes of opposite parity .",
    "the evolution equations correspond to a hopf bifurcation with broken d@xmath0 symmetry , where the `` interchange '' symmetry between the two modes is weakly broken because of the large but finite aspect - ratio . for open parameter regimes ,",
    "periodic or irregular bursting with very large dynamic range can occur close to threshold .",
    "the bursts are associated with nonattracting heteroclinic cycles involving solutions `` at infinity ''  @xcite .",
    "these cycles may be structurally stable or unstable .",
    "bursts occur when the system evolves toward an infinite amplitude state along its stable manifold , then gets kicked toward another infinite amplitude state with an unstable manifold which returns the system to finite amplitude .",
    "this mechanism provides an explanation for bursts found experimentally for large aspect - ratio binary fluid convection  @xcite , and may also provide a deterministic explanation for the variability of the solar magnetic cycle  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of this to other mechanisms for bursting is given in  @xcite .",
    "related bursts can occur due to the resonant temporal forcing of a system undergoing a hopf bifurcation with d@xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "when noise is added to the model considered in  @xcite , there will be a burst with larger amplitude if the noise kicks the system closer to the stable manifold of an infinite amplitude state , and a burst with smaller amplitude if the noise kicks it away .",
    "thus a state which bursts in the absence of noise is still expected to burst in the presence of noise , but the successive burst amplitudes and the time between successive bursts may change substantially .",
    "the details of the effect of noise on the bursting behavior are described in this paper .",
    "this includes the possibility that noise can affect the physical manifestations of the bursts .",
    "specifically , purely blinking and winking states in which successive bursts occur at opposite sides or the same side of the container , respectively , can be destroyed by sufficiently large noise .",
    "finally , it is shown that related bursts can occur even if the d@xmath0 symmetry of the model is _ not _ broken , i.e. , when noise is added to the normal form equations for the hopf bifurcation with _ exact _ d@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "for binary fluid convection , if the separation ratio of the mixture is sufficiently negative then convection arises via a hopf bifurcation .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath1he/@xmath2he mixture used by sullivan and ahlers  @xcite in their experiment carried out in the large aspect - ratio rectangular container @xmath3 with aspect - ratio @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in this experiment , it was observed that immediately above threshold convective heat transport may take place in a sequence of irregular bursts of large dynamic range despite constant heat input . a model for this experiment",
    "is considered in  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation to the conduction state temperature profile is assumed to take the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 are @xmath9 are the ( complex ) amplitudes of the first modes to lose stability which are respectively even and odd under the reflection @xmath10 . in  @xcite ,",
    "evolution equations for @xmath8 and @xmath9 were derived using symmetry arguments , with the resulting equations describing a hopf bifurcation with broken d@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the applicability of this model to the experiment is discussed further in  @xcite . as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "solutions of the evolution equations include bursts of very large dynamic range similar to those found in the experiments .",
    "the mechanism by which these bursts arise is discussed in detail in  @xcite , and is summarized below .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the model considered in  @xcite to include additive random forcing terms . specifically , we consider the formal equations @xmath11 where the @xmath12 s represent real , independent gaussian white noise random processes with the properties @xmath13 here @xmath14 are complex , and @xmath15 are real .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 measures the difference in frequency between the two modes at onset , and @xmath17 measures the difference in their linear growth rates .",

    "such an analysis ( see  @xcite ) allows us to conclude that , for this truncation , infinite amplitude periodic and quasiperiodic solutions exist .",
    "bursts are associated with heteroclinic cycles involving such infinite amplitude states .",
    "reference  @xcite shows that for such cycles to form , it is necessary to have at least one subcritical and one supercritical solution branch bifurcating from the trivial state with @xmath32 ; also , the `` angular stability '' properties of the solutions must be correct .",

    "of course , the infinite amplitude solutions and connections to them are of physical interest only insofar as they are responsible for the presence of nearby solutions which make visits to large but finite amplitude .",

    "we now describe the effect of noise on the bursting behavior reported in  @xcite .",
    "coefficient values which give the appropriate sub- and supercriticality of traveling and standing wave branches in large aspect - ratio binary fluid convection systems are considered  @xcite : @xmath35 @xmath36 for these coefficient values in the absence of noise , nonattracting , structurally stable heteroclinic cycles connecting infinite amplitude periodic orbits ( hereafter , @xmath37 solutions ) and infinite amplitude quasiperiodic orbits ( hereafter , @xmath38 solutions ) exist over a range of @xmath39 values .",
    "these heteroclinic cycles are of shilnikov - hopf type , and there are associated stable solutions which display bursting behavior  @xcite .    for definiteness , consider the stable quasiperiodic solution which is present in the absence of noise for @xmath40 ( see figure  [ blinking](a ) ; in the notation of  @xcite , this is a @xmath41 solution ) .",

    "the @xmath38 solutions are unstable in the @xmath44 direction , so the trajectory returns to smaller amplitude ( larger  @xmath44 ) .",
    "physically , this solution corresponds to a _ blinking state _ for the convection system because successive bursts occur at opposite sides of the container  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ blinking](b ) shows the corresponding results for @xmath45 . clearly , even this very small amount of noise can have a very large effect on the burst amplitudes .",
    "these and other numerical results were obtained using a stochastic second - order runge - kutta algorithm  @xcite . unless otherwise indicated , the time step of integration is @xmath46 .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ blinking](b ) may be qualitatively understood by recognizing that there will be a burst with larger amplitude if the noise kicks the trajectory closer to the stable manifold of a @xmath37 solution , and a burst with smaller amplitude if the noise kicks it away .",

    "@xmath62 , independent of @xmath61 .",
    "the noise strengths have been restricted to the range shown in the figure because for larger @xmath61 the noise can kick the trajectory close enough to the stable manifold of a @xmath37 solution that the long - time integration of equations  ( [ z+],[z- ] ) becomes numerically difficult .",
    "we now show how to understand the statistical properties of the bursts in terms of the properties of @xmath63 . in the following ,",
    "we ignore the strongly contracting @xmath64 direction .",
    "define @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and consider how the pdf @xmath63 at @xmath67 evolves into a pdf @xmath68 at @xmath69 ( see figure  [ sketch ] ) .",
    "when the amplitude @xmath70 becomes large ( i.e. when @xmath44 becomes small ) , the noise terms in equations  ( [ z+],[z- ] ) are overwhelmed by the cubic deterministic terms .",
    "therefore , provided @xmath71 is sufficiently small , we can ignore the noise over the part of the trajectory shown in figure  [ sketch ] and approximate the vector field by equation  ( [ linearization ] ) .",
    "the point @xmath72 is mapped into @xmath73 under the flow , where @xmath74 .",

    "these functional forms for the pdf s are verified for @xmath45 in figure  [ pdf](a , b ) .    for the range of noise strengths considered , @xmath88 independent of @xmath61 ; this is expected from  ( [ f_relations ] ) recalling that @xmath78 was found to be independent of @xmath61 .",
    "the variance @xmath89 of the fitted distributions is linear in the noise strength @xmath61 ( see figure  [ pdf_fit](a ) ) .",

    "it is interesting to compare these results to the results of  @xcite which considered the effect of noise on attracting , structurally stable heteroclinic cycles connecting _",
    "finite _ amplitude fixed points .",
    "it was found that the distribution of times between successive visits near the fixed points on the cycle was _ not _ gaussian ; instead , it has a long , exponential tail for large times .",
    "there is a fundamental reason for the difference between those results and the results presented here : because the heteroclinic cycles considered in  @xcite connect _ finite _ amplitude solutions , the trajectory spends most its time in a small neighborhood these solutions .",
    "indeed , this is what allowed a detailed analysis for the times between successive visits near the fixed points to be done . on the other hand ,",
    "the heteroclinic cycles considered in this paper involve _ infinite _ amplitude solutions and are traced out in _ finite _ time  @xcite . more specifically , in the original time @xmath34 defined by @xmath95 , equations  ( [ linearization ] ) become @xmath96 assuming the initial condition @xmath97 at @xmath98 , these equations have the solution @xmath99 @xmath100 the time to go from @xmath67 to @xmath69 is thus @xmath101 for the limit @xmath102 ( i.e. , as the heteroclinic cycle is approached ) , @xmath103 , a _ finite _ time .",
    "a similar argument shows that the trajectory also returns from infinity in finite time ( cf .",
    "this is why the time series in figure  [ blinking](a ) shows very rapid growth to and decay from large amplitude .",
    "we conclude that the time spent near solutions at infinity is not a dominant part of the total time between bursts .",
    "thus , the results given in @xcite are not relevant here .",
    "it is not possible to do detailed analytical work for the statistics of the times between bursts because this would require a more detailed understanding of how the trajectory behaves away from the @xmath37 solutions .",
    "however , the following model for the flow between successive bursts gives some qualitative understanding .",
    "consider the formal equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 is constant , and @xmath106 is a gaussian white noise random process with @xmath107 and @xmath108 . if @xmath109 at @xmath98 , the conditional probability distribution function @xmath110 for solutions of equation  ( [ arclength ] ) obeys the fokker - planck equation @xmath111 this has solution @xmath112 i.e. , a gaussian centered at @xmath113 and with variance @xmath114 .",
    "the average time to reach a _ fixed _",
    "value @xmath115 is then @xmath116 , and the pdf for @xmath117 at this time is @xmath118 .",
    "we can re - express this in terms of a pdf for the time @xmath90 at which @xmath115 by using the deterministic approximation @xmath119 .",
    "then , using @xmath120 , we obtain @xmath121 we make a connection to the distribution of times between successive bursts by thinking of @xmath117 as an arclength coordinate along a trajectory for equations  ( [ z+],[z- ] ) .",
    "because the trajectory does not spend a dominant part of its time in a neighborhood of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 solutions , equation  ( [ arclength ] ) is a reasonable model for the flow .",
    "assume that the arclength traced out between successive bursts is roughly constant .",
    "the qualitative model  ( [ arclength ] ) thus predicts a gaussian distribution for the time between successive bursts , with the average time between bursts independent of and the variance linear in @xmath61 .",
    "this is precisely what was found numerically .",
    "figure  [ large_noise ] shows the projection of a numerical solution to equations  ( [ z+],[z- ] ) with the same parameter values as for the trajectories shown in figure  [ blinking ] , except with @xmath122 .    unlike the result in figure",
    "[ blinking](b ) for much smaller noise strength , here the underlying stable quasiperiodic solution is not even recognizable .",
    "the arrows in figure  [ large_noise](b ) show that the trajectory can make a visit near a @xmath37 solution and depart either to the `` left '' or to the `` right '' . in the @xmath47 coordinates introduced above ( cf . equation  ( [ linearization ] ) ) , the trajectory can intersect a surface of constant @xmath44 for either positive or negative @xmath56 values .",
    "thus , sufficiently large noise can be responsible for the trajectory crossing the stable manifold of the @xmath37 solutions .",
    "this leads to the possibility that successive visits near infinity can either be to _ different _ or to the _ same _ @xmath37 solutions . in the convection system , successive visits near the _ same _",
    "@xmath37 solution correspond to successive bursts occurring on the _ same _ side of the container  @xcite .",
    "therefore , sufficiently large noise can affect the physical manifestation of the bursts by destroying purely blinking states .",
    "reference  @xcite also identified a different type of stable quasiperiodic solution which is present in the absence of noise for @xmath123 ( in the notation of  @xcite , this is a @xmath124 solution ) .",
    "the trajectory for this solution makes successive visits always near the _ same _ @xmath37 solution ( see figure  [ winking](a ) ) .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a _ winking state _ for the convection system because successive bursts occur at the same side of the container  @xcite .",
    "this solution coexists with stable , finite amplitude periodic solutions at @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is an integer .",
    "reference  @xcite argues that these stable , finite amplitude periodic solutions are more likely to be observed in experiments in which the rayleigh number is ramped upwards , which helps to explain why winking states have apparently never been observed in binary fluid convection experiments .",
    "it is seen that even a very small amount of noise @xmath127 can kick the system out of the basin of attraction of the winking state and into the basin of attraction of a stable periodic solution ( see figure  [ winking](b ) ) .",
    "thus , even if a winking state could be established in an experiment , it would be particularly sensitive to noise .",
    "it will now be shown that related bursts may occur for equations  ( [ z+],[z- ] ) even in the absence of forced symmetry - breaking , that is , when noise is added to the normal form equations for the hopf bifurcation with _ exact _ d@xmath0 symmetry . specifically , consider equations  ( [ z+],[z- ] ) with the same parameters as considered in the previous section ( @xmath128 ) , except with @xmath129 .",
    "for these coefficient values in the absence of noise , a branch of unstable periodic solutions bifurcates subcritically from the trivial state , and two branches of unstable periodic orbits and one branch of globally attracting quasiperiodic solutions all bifurcate supercritically  ( see @xcite , also  @xcite ) .",
    "infinite amplitude periodic and quasiperiodic solutions exist as counterparts of the finite amplitude solutions which bifurcate from the trivial state .",
    "in particular , @xmath37 and @xmath38 solutions are the infinite amplitude counterparts of the periodic solutions on the subcritical branch and quasiperiodic solutions on the supercritical branch , respectively  @xcite .",
    "if for some reason the trajectory comes close to the stable manifold of a @xmath37 solution , it will make an excursion to a neighborhood of that solution , then get kicked toward a @xmath38 solution which returns it to smaller amplitude .",
    "however , since the finite amplitude quasiperiodic solutions are _ globally _ attracting , heteroclinic cycles involving infinite amplitude solutions can not form , so such a burst is a transient phenomenon .",
    "a stable quasiperiodic solution is shown for @xmath40 , @xmath18 in figure  [ noise_induced](a ) .    for small noise",
    "the trajectory remains near the quasiperiodic solution ( see figure  [ noise_induced](b ) ) .",
    "however , sufficiently large noise can repeatedly kick the system close to the stable manifold of a @xmath37 solution , leading to bursts of very large dynamic range ( see figure  [ noise_induced](c ) ) .",
    "this is highly reminiscent of results for the effect of resonant temporal forcing on the hopf bifurcation with d@xmath0 symmetry  @xcite ; there it was found that as the forcing amplitude increased , the attractor came closer to the stable manifolds of @xmath37 solutions , leading to bursting behavior .    as a further demonstration of the effect of noise on a hopf bifurcation with exact d@xmath0 symmetry , we close by considering an _ attracting _ infinite amplitude heteroclinic cycle .",
    "specifically , consider the parameters @xmath130 .",
    "using the results of  @xcite , it can be shown that there are heteroclinic connections between @xmath37 solutions _ within _ the @xmath30 subspace .",
    "linearizing equations  ( [ rho]-[phi_rho ] ) about the @xmath37 solutions shows that the eigenvalue corresponding to perturbations in the @xmath44 direction is @xmath131 , while the eigenvalues corresponding to perturbations within the @xmath30 subspace are @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "since the first eigenvalue is negative and the sum of the latter two eigenvalues is also negative , the heteroclinic cycle connecting @xmath37 is _ attracting _ ( cf .",
    "figure  [ hetero ] shows a numerically calculated trajectory for these parameter values and @xmath134 ; the time step of integration is @xmath135 .",
    "much like the situations described in  @xcite , noise causes the attracting heteroclinic cycle to become a `` statistical limit cycle '' in which switching between @xmath37 solutions occurs randomly in time but with a well - defined mean period .",
    "the effect of additive white noise on a model for large aspect - ratio binary fluid convection has been considered .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the effect of noise on bursting behavior present in the model .",
    "it was shown that even a very small amount of noise can have a very large effect on the amplitudes of successive bursts .",
    "this is because there will be a burst with larger amplitude if the noise kicks the system closer to the stable manifold of an infinite amplitude state , and a burst with smaller amplitude if the noise kicks it away .",
    "numerical results and analytical arguments were given to understand the statistical properties of bursts in the presence of noise .",
    "it was also demonstrated that large enough noise can affect the physical manifestations of the bursts by destroying purely blinking and purely winking states .",
    "in fact , winking states are particularly sensitive to noise , which helps to explain why they have apparently never been observed in experiments .",
    "finally , it was shown that related bursts can occur when noise is added to the normal form equations for the hopf bifurcation with _",
    "exact _ square symmetry .",
    "reasoning similar to that given in  @xcite suggests that this type of bursting behavior can persist when higher terms in equations  ( [ z+],[z- ] ) are retained , even in the presence of noise .",
    "bursts will then be associated with visits near large but _ finite _ amplitude solutions .",
    "this is important because it implies that bursts similar to those described in this paper may be observed in real physical systems undergoing a hopf bifurcation with exact or weakly broken d@xmath0 symmetry ; the ( unphysical ) infinite amplitude solutions are not necessary .",
    "there is also a possibility that in appropriate cases the noise could be more important than higher order terms so their exact nature would be irrelevant .    other physical systems for which the results presented in the paper might be relevant because their evolution equations are related to the hopf bifurcation with d@xmath0 symmetry include any system in a square domain undergoing an oscillatory instability  @xcite or displaying oscillatory patterns which are periodic on a square lattice  @xcite , electrohydrodynamic convection in liquid crystals  @xcite , lasers  @xcite , spring - supported fluid - conveying tubes  @xcite , the faraday system in a square or nearly - square container  @xcite , and dynamo theories of magnetic field generation in the sun  @xcite .",
