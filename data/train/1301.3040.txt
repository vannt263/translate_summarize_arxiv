    "the integral characteristic of motion in a system of classical particles is the total kinetic energy @xmath0 .",
    "however , for quite different types of motion , the value of @xmath0 can obviously be the same .",
    "for instance , consider a system of two particles with the fixed center - of - mass and let @xmath8 be the vector connecting the particles . depending on the forces and initial conditions , this two - particle system can _ vibrate _ ( if the direction of @xmath9 is not changing ) or _ rotate _ ( if the length of @xmath9 is not changing ) , and the kinetic energy in both the cases may attain any positive value .",
    "however , these two kinds of motion are in fact extremes : a typical motion is a mixture of vibrations and rotations . of course ,",
    "in the case of two particles , the total kinetic energy @xmath0 can be straightforwardly and naturally decomposed as the sum of two terms corresponding to vibrations and rotations .",
    "indeed , let @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the component parallel to @xmath9 and @xmath12 is the component orthogonal to @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the vibrational energy and @xmath15 is the rotational energy ( here @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the masses of the particles and @xmath18 is the angle between @xmath9 and @xmath19 ) .    in the case of three or more particles",
    ", there are much more kinds of motion : one has to distinguish rotations of the system in question ( the `` _ _ cluster _ _ '' or `` _ _ aggregate _ _ '' ) as a whole , changes in the principal moments of inertia , various rearrangements of particles in the cluster , etc .",
    "in this situation , it becomes a rather non - trivial and ambiguous task to define the components of @xmath0 corresponding to various _",
    "modes _ of the motion .",
    "this problem has been discussed in the literature for decades and several approaches to kinetic energy partitioning have been proposed ; see e.g.  the well known papers @xcite , the recent studies by marsden and coworkers @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the importance of exploring the contributions of various motion modes to the total kinetic energy @xmath0 stems , to a large extent , from the fact that such energy components may most probably be used as effective _",
    "global indicators _ of dynamical features and critical phenomena ( e.g.  phase transitions ) in classical clusters .",
    "if these energy terms are defined in a sufficiently `` symmetric '' and `` invariant '' manner and can be computed automatically and fast from the coordinates and velocities of the particles , then one expects to be able to straightforwardly detect structural metamorphoses in the cluster by observing abrupt changes in the way the total kinetic energy is distributed among the modes . in the case of large clusters ,",
    "this is crucial for applications because it is much easier to trace a few indicators than to analyze a huge collection of data pertaining to all the particles .    starting in 2002",
    ", we have published a series of papers @xcite where we proposed and preliminarily tested a number of such global indicators on the basis of the so - called _ hyperspherical approach _ to cluster dynamics .",
    "in particular , several partitions of the total kinetic energy @xmath0 with various amazing features were defined in  @xcite for particles in the conventional three - dimensional space and in  @xcite for particles in the euclidean space of an arbitrary dimension @xmath4 . moreover",
    ", our long paper  @xcite contains also _ rigorous mathematical proofs _ of many properties ( including the invariance under certain group actions ) of the terms of these partitions .",
    "a refinement of one of the partitions was performed in  @xcite and four new terms were introduced .",
    "some perspectives of the partitions in question are discussed from the general viewpoint of the methods of molecular dynamics ( with the particles being atoms or ions ) in the short reviews @xcite .",
    "applications include studies of such phenomena and processes in chemical physics as phase transitions in small neutral argon clusters @xmath20 with @xmath21 @xcite , dynamics and thermodynamics of small ionic argon clusters @xmath22 with @xmath23  @xcite , the prototypical exchange reaction @xmath24 of atomic fluorine and molecular hydrogen  @xcite , and ultrafast relaxation dynamics of krypton atomic matrices doped with a nitrogen monoxide molecule @xcite ( some of these applications are surveyed in  @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have confirmed the usefulness of the kinetic energy partitions for examining dynamics of classical nanoaggregates .",
    "however , neither the theory developed in the articles @xcite nor the applications considered in @xcite allow one to conclude how the energy partitions defined in @xcite look like for `` typical '' systems ( roughly speaking , for a random choice of the coordinates and velocities of the particles ) or how the statistics of the terms depends on the number @xmath1 of the particles and on their masses .",
    "the statistics of the kinetic energy components for systems in the conventional space @xmath25 was studied numerically in our paper  @xcite in the range @xmath6 for two extreme situations : in the case where all the particles have equal masses and in the case where the masses are chosen at random .",
    "the main observation of  @xcite is that in the situation of equal masses , the mean values of almost all the terms of the partitions in the normalization @xmath3 are _ very simple _ ( in fact , linear fractional for @xmath26 ) functions of @xmath1 .",
    "for some of the terms , the paper  @xcite proposed also generalizations of the formulas for the mean values to an arbitrary dimension @xmath4 of the space .",
    "the aim of the present article is fourfold .",
    "first , we rigorously prove the properties of the new energy terms @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 announced in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "second , in the situation of equal masses , we suggest formulas for the mean values of _ all _ the energy components ( except for the so - called unbounded ones ) for @xmath1 particles in @xmath2 with an _ arbitrary _ @xmath4 : the mean values turn out to be simple rational functions of @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath31 .",
    "third , we prove these formulas at the `` physical level '' of rigor .",
    "fourth , we examine numerically the statistics of all the energy terms , both in the situation of equal masses and in the situation of random masses , for @xmath1 particles _ on the plane _",
    "@xmath32 in the same range @xmath6 as in  @xcite .",
    "in the situation of equal masses , our numerical experiments do confirm the formulas for the mean values of the energy terms .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that two - dimensional physics is a well developed and rapidly progressing field of science , see e.g.  the works @xcite and references therein ( by the way , the preprint  @xcite contains 680 references ) .",
    "of course , here the words `` two - dimensional '' can be used either in the mathematical sense or in the sense of monolayer films . in particular , the nobel prize in physics of 2010 was awarded jointly to andre k. geim and konstantin s. novoselov `` for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two - dimensional material graphene '' @xcite .",
    "moreover , a paradigm was recently proposed in which the _ actual _ space - time is a fundamentally @xmath33-dimensional universe but it is `` wrapped up '' in such a way that it appears higher dimensional ( say , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) at larger distances @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "some fundamental theoretical concepts related to our approach to kinetic energy partitions are recalled in sections  [ invariants ] and  [ momenta ] while the partitions themselves are defined in section  [ partitions ] .",
    "almost all the material of sections   is in fact contained in our articles @xcite and is reproduced here for the reader s convenience .",
    "the new energy terms @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 of  @xcite are defined and explored in section  [ elaboration ] .",
    "the formulas for the mean values of the bounded energy components for @xmath1 particles of equal masses in @xmath2 are proposed in section  [ contexts ] and substantiated in section  [ dokazatelstvo ] .",
    "the numerical experiments for @xmath5 and their results are described in section  [ numerics ] .",
    "concluding remarks follow in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "consider a system of @xmath1 classical particles in the euclidean space @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) with masses @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 be the radii vectors of these particles with respect to the origin .",
    "introduce the notation @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . in terms of the total mass @xmath41 of the system and the _",
    "mass - scaled _ radii vectors @xmath42 , the total kinetic energy @xmath0 and the total angular momentum @xmath43 of this system are expressed in an especially simple way : @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . here",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 denote respectively the @xmath48th components of the vectors @xmath49 and @xmath42 and , as usual , the dot over a letter means the time derivative . for @xmath7 , the formulas   and   give the conventional total kinetic energy and total angular momentum of a system of @xmath1 particles .",
    "thus , the mass - scaled radii vectors @xmath50 provide a more adequate description of the current state of a system of classical particles than the radii vectors @xmath51 themselves .",
    "the _ position matrix _ of a system of @xmath1 classical particles in @xmath2 is the @xmath52 matrix @xmath53 whose columns are the mass - scaled radii vectors @xmath54 .",
    "of course , the position matrix at any given time instant @xmath55 depends on the cartesian coordinate frame chosen .",
    "the choice of another coordinate frame ( with the same origin ) is described by a transformation @xmath56 with an orthogonal @xmath57 matrix @xmath58 . on the other hand , according to the general duality concept for the _ physical space _ and the abstract `` _ _ kinematic space _ _ '' @xcite ( which are respectively @xmath2 and @xmath59 in our case ) , one can also consider transformations of the form @xmath60 with orthogonal @xmath61 matrices @xmath62 where the asterisk designates transposing .",
    "such transformations correspond to changes in the `` _ _ type _ _ '' of the coordinate frame .",
    "for instance , the passage from cartesian coordinates to jacobi or radau ",
    "smith coordinate frames ( see e.g.  the papers @xcite and references therein ) is equivalent to a multiplication of the position matrix from the right by a suitable fixed orthogonal matrix  @xcite .    [ reduction ] suppose that the @xmath63 particles in question move without external forces and their center - of - mass coincides with the origin .",
    "then in any cartesian coordinate frame @xmath64 choose an arbitrary matrix @xmath62 with the entries in the last row equal to @xmath65 then the _ last column _ of the matrix @xmath66 is zero at any time moment @xmath55 ( and one may therefore regard the `` kinematic space '' to be @xmath67 ) .",
    "we are interested in characterizing systems of classical particles in @xmath2 by various quantities that are determined , at any time instant @xmath68 , by the positions @xmath69 and velocities @xmath70 of the particles below .",

    "( rather than by the whole trajectory @xmath71 ) and are invariant under orthogonal coordinate transformations below .",
    "] both in the physical space and in the `` kinematic space '' .",
    "being inspired by the discussion above and , in particular , by example  [ reduction ] , one arrives at the following mathematical model .",
    "let @xmath72 .",
    "consider the space @xmath73 of the _ pairs _ of real @xmath74 matrices .",

    "one of them is pointed out in our previous paper  @xcite and consists in defining the energy terms corresponding to the actions of arbitrary subgroups of the orthogonal groups @xmath700 and @xmath701 .",
    "another approach recently proposed by marsden and coworkers  @xcite for @xmath7 is called the _ hyperspherical mode analysis _ by the authors .",

    "modes , and @xmath703 _ shearing _ modes . most probably , marsden s theory can be generalized to the case of an arbitrary dimension @xmath4 .",
    "one of the main results of our previous paper  @xcite and the present paper is that in the situation of equal masses , the mean values @xmath593 of various components @xmath384 of the total kinetic energy @xmath0 are expressed in terms of the dimension @xmath4 of the physical space and the number @xmath1 of particles in a very simple way .",
    "however , it is not clear at all whether the _ distributions _ of @xmath384 are `` simple '' functions of @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath384 , not to mention the joint distributions of several components .",
    "for instance , we have not attempted to find any expressions for the variances @xmath562 of @xmath384 [ or , equivalently , for @xmath704 or , say , for the correlation coefficients @xcite between the energy terms .",
