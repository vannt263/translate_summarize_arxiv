    "the tunneling of electrons through quantum dot structures has been the subject of active research during the last years . for the confinement of electron in all three dimensions ,",
    "quantum dots are characterized by the discreteness of the energy levels , and for this reason are often called `` artificial atoms '' .",
    "@xcite one of the main features of transport through quantum dots is that the coherence of electrons is greatly preserved , as manifested in phenomena such as the aharonov - bohm oscillations in multiply connected geometries , @xcite the kondo effect in dots strongly coupled to electron reservoirs , @xcite and fano - type line shapes in transport through multiple channels .",
    "@xcite    two or more quantum dots can be coupled to form an `` artificial molecule '' , in which electrons are shared by the different sites .",
    "the formation of bonding and antibonding states in such molecules has been studied by means of transport @xcite as well as spectroscopy experiments .",
    "@xcite theoretical work on electron transport through serial quantum dot configurations is contained in refs .",
    "@xcite , and quantum interference effects have been explored in parallel and `` t - shaped '' geometries .",
    "@xcite particular interest in quantum dot molecules lies in their potential application in quantum computing devices . in this context ,",
    "diverse proposals have been made , where the quantum bits are built with electron spin states @xcite or with the coherent mode generated by discrete states in an artificial molecule .",
    "@xcite    in this work we study the electronic transport through a double quantum dot molecule attached to leads , in a transition from a connection in series to a completely symmetrical parallel configuration .",
    "we examine the linear conductance at zero temperature and obtain the associated densities of states of each of the dots .",
    "we find that the conductance spectrum is composed of a lorentzian centered at the bonding energy and a fano line shape at the energy of the antibonding state .",
    "the latter arises due to the presence of a bound state of the molecule , immersed in the band continuum .",
    "a progressive line narrowing of the fano peak is observed as the system transits from the series to the symmetrical parallel configuration . for the perfectly symmetrical geometry ,",
    "the antibonding state is totally uncoupled of the leads , the bonding state becoming the only one that participates in the transmission . in this extreme case",
    ", the antibonding state is localized , with zero localization length .",
    "although exponentially localized states generally exist outside the band continuum , this state is in the conduction band and acts like a ghost of the fano resonance .",
    "we consider two neighboring quantum dots forming a molecule , coupled to left and right leads as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . only one energy level in each dot",
    "is assumed relevant and the interdot and intradot electron - electron interactions are neglected .",
    "the system can be modelled by a non - interacting two - impurity anderson hamiltonian , which can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the dynamics of the isolate molecule , @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the energy of dot @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath6 annihilates ( creates ) an electron in dot @xmath4 and @xmath7 is the interdot tunneling coupling .",
    "@xmath8 is the hamiltonian for the noninteracting electrons in the left and right leads @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron of quantum number @xmath12 and energy @xmath13 in the contact @xmath14 . finally , @xmath15 accounts for the tunneling between dots and leads , @xmath16 with @xmath17 the tunneling matrix element .",
    "the linear conductance @xmath18 is related to the transmission @xmath19 of an electron of energy @xmath20 by the landauer formula at zero temperature @xcite , @xmath21 to obtain explicitly @xmath18 , we use the equation of motion approach for the green s function @xcite .",
    "the retarded green s function is defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the step function . in the absence of interaction ,",
    "the total transmission @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fourier transform of the retarded ( advanced ) green s function of the molecule , and the matrix @xmath26 describes the tunneling coupling of the two quantum dots to the left ( right ) lead , with @xmath27 the equation of motion method uses the heisenberg equations for the fermi operators of the molecule , which are inserted in the time derivatives of the green s functions of eq .",
    "( [ eq-6 ] ) .",
    "this leads to first order differential equations for the @xmath28 s , containing green s functions for different dot operators , as well as others involving dot and lead operators . through the same procedure , equations for these new green s functions",
    "are obtained , until having a closed set .",
    "a fourier transform of such a set of equation takes it to an algebraic linear system for the @xmath29 s , the solution of which leads to the following expression for @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "a useful quantity which provides insight into the electronic distribution is the local density of states in dot @xmath4 .",

    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq-12])-([eq-13 ] ) that @xmath53 has two resonances , corresponding to the bonding and antibonding states , at the energies @xmath54 which in general differ from the eigenvalues for the isolate molecule , @xmath55 .",
    "the resonances can be distinguished only when @xmath56 increases , up to vanishing when @xmath57 , where the bonding and antibonding states coincide with those of the isolated molecule .",
    "a similar level attraction is reported by kubala _",
    "@xcite in an aharonov - bohm ring with a quantum dot in each of its arms .",
    "we notice also that the conductance vanishes at the fermi energy @xmath58 provided @xmath59 .",
    "this antiresonance - like behavior , characterized by strictly zero transmission , is a consequence of destructive quantum interference between the different pathways through the dots , and does not exist for the connection in series , where only one possible pathway exists .",
    "also , it can be shown that @xmath53 reaches the quantum limit @xmath60 at specific values of the energy provided @xmath61 .",
    "for the molecule connected in series perfect transmission requires that the interdot coupling strength be at least @xmath62 , while in the parallel configuration with a weak interdot coupling it behaves as an ideal channel if the dot - lead coupling strengths are all of similar magnitude . without loss of generality we can set @xmath63 , convention",
    "we adopt in what follows .    in fig .",

    "the dash and dotted lines in ( b ) correspond , respectively , to the breit - wigner and fano line shapes of eqs .",

    "@xcite in a junction with two resonant impurities .",
    "this line narrowing ( widening ) in the conductance can be interpreted as an increase ( reduction ) of the lifetime @xmath88 of the corresponding molecular state , with @xmath89 the associated linewidth .",
    "the strong narrowing of the fano peak when @xmath65 is close to @xmath90 is a signal of slow transitions between the antibonding state and the leads .",
    "the lifetime of the antibonding state becomes infinitely long when @xmath65 approaches @xmath91 typically , the @xmath92 s are of the order of @xmath93 s , so that the lifetimes of quantum dots attached to leads in series are of the order of @xmath94 .",
    "however , if in the present configuration @xmath95 @xmath93 and @xmath96 @xmath93 , one obtains @xmath97 @xmath93 , then the lifetime of the antibonding state is @xmath98 @xmath99 , that is , four orders of magnitude larger .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as follows from expressions ( [ eq-12])-([eq-13 ] ) and as displayed by fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , when @xmath38 , the fano resonance entirely disappears and the conductance reduces exactly to the lorentzian @xmath100 expression with the form of the conductance of a single quantum dot centered at the bonding energy , with an effective line broadening @xmath101 .",
    "this would indicate that only the bonding state contributes to the transmission through the molecule .",
    "additional insight into the physics underlying these results can be obtained by examining the local density of states in each of the quantum dots .",
    "for @xmath102 the density of states at both quantum dots is the same , and the electron has the same probability of being found at one or the other ( covalent limit ) .",

    "the lorenztian centered at the bonding energy acquires the width @xmath86 , while the one at the antibonding energy becomes a delta function .",
