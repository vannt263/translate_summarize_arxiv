    "new abelian gauge symmetries are arguably the simplest extensions of the standard model ( sm ) ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) . if sm fermions are charged under a new abelian @xmath7 , its couplings are strongly constrained by direct searches and especially by fcnc processes .",
    "the simplest and widely studied possibility in the literature is when sm fermions have flavor - independent charges .",
    "most popular examples in this class are @xmath8 or linear combinations @xmath9 .",
    "they are actually the only family - independent , anomaly - free gauged symmetries commuting with the sm gauge group in case where there are no new fermions beyond the ones of the sm .",
    "family - dependent anomaly - free models with no extra fermions were also extensively studied . in all such cases",
    ", the @xmath0 should be heavy enough to escape detection , at least in the multi - tev range .",
    "there is also a large literature on light @xmath10 s of string or field theory origin with anomaly cancellation a la green - schwarz @xcite , with low - energy anomalies canceled by axionic couplings and generalized chern - simons terms , or in other models with stueckelberg realization of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a radically different option is to have no sm fermions charged under @xmath0 .",
    "this is a relatively natural framework in string theory with d - branes .",
    "but it is also natural from a field theory viewpoint , with additional heavy fermions @xmath11 , called  mediators \" in what follows , which mediate effective interactions , described by the dimension - four kinetic mixing and higher - dimensional operators between the @xmath0 and the sm sector @xcite .",
    "if one wants mediators parametrically heavier than the electroweak scale ( say in the tev range ) , we need , in addition to possible sm higgs contributions , an additional source to their mass .",
    "a purely dirac mass is of course a simple viable option .",
    "however as argued in @xcite , because of the furry theorem , the only low - dimensional induced effective operator is the kinetic mixing , whereas the next higher - dimensional ones are of dimension eight . throughout our paper",
    ", we consider the kinetic mixing to be small enough .",
    "if we are interested in @xmath0 couplings to gluons , this can be achieved for example by having colored mediators with no hypercharge . in this case , the main couplings between the  hidden \" @xmath0 and the sm are generated by higher - dimensional effective operators ( hdo s ) , the lowest relevant ones being of dimension six .",
    "however , we will show that in the parameter space allowed by the planck / wmap data , the phenomenological consequences induced by the presence of a kinetic mixing allowed by various constraints are negligible . the simplest and natural option to obtain dimension - six effective operators",
    "is to generate the mediator masses by the vev of the scalar field @xmath12 breaking spontaneously the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "the corresponding induced mediator masses , called generically @xmath13 in what follows , determine the mass scale of the hdo s and also the uv cutoff of the effective theory .",
    "there could also be contributions to their mass from the sm higgs field @xmath14 , which are considered to be smaller , such that we can expand in powers of @xmath15 and obtain operators invariant under the sm gauge group .",
    "such a framework was already investigated in @xcite from the viewpoint of the effective couplings of @xmath0 to electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "the potential implications to dark matter , considered to be the lightest fermion in the dark sector was also investigated , with the outcome that a monochromatic gamma ray line from the dark matter annihilation is potentially observable .",
    "the potential existence of a signal in the fermi data was largely discussed in the recent literature @xcite and will not be discussed further here .    in this paper",
    "we extend the previous works by allowing the mediators to be colored and therefore the @xmath0 to couple to gluons . we restrict ourselves throughout the paper to cp even couplings for simplicity .",
    "these couplings are more restricted by symmetries than the ones to the electroweak gauge bosons and their presence change significantly the phenomenology of such models . whereas at dimension - six order four such operators are possible , only two of them are induced by heavy fermion mediators loops .",
    "moreover , only one operator contributes to amplitudes in which at least one of the gluons is on - shell , as will be the case throughout our paper .",
    "we analyze in detail the corresponding phenomenology from the viewpoint of the dark matter relic abundance , direct and indirect dark matter detection and lhc constraints .",
    "allowing couplings to gluons and at the same time to electroweak gauge bosons does not change significantly the phenomenology of the @xmath0 compared to the case where only couplings to gluons are allowed .",
    "one interesting conceptual difference is that , whereas the @xmath0 couplings to gluons and photons _ vanish _ for an on - shell @xmath0 due to the landau - yang theorem @xcite , the couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath16,@xmath17 do not vanish ; they lead on the contrary to an _ enhancement _ close to the @xmath0 pole .",
    "another interesting result is that , unlike the case of kinetic mixing , the dark matter annihilation into gluons induced by virtual @xmath0 exchange can give correct relic density for heavy dark matter and @xmath0 masses , well above the electroweak scale . since our interest here is to have complementary constraints from dark matter searches and lhc , we nonetheless confine our analysis to masses below than or of the order tev in what follows .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the basic formalism we will use , which is stueckelberg realization of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "it contains the list of the lowest dimensional effective operators generated by integrating - out heavy fermionic mediators , their classification depending on the nature of messenger masses and charges and the explicit loop computation of the @xmath0 couplings to gluons .",
    "section 3 deals with the consequences of the model for dark matter generation in the early universe , focusing on the annihilation to a gluon pair .",
    "section 4 contains the various phenomenological constraints coming from the unique @xmath0 coupling to gluons generated at one - loop by heavy colored mediators .",
    "section 5 contains the re - analysis of the various constraints when @xmath0 couplings to electroweak gauge bosons are also added .",
    "appendices contain more details about the gauge independence of the @xmath0 mediated hidden - sector - sm couplings , the effective operator couplings @xmath0 to gluons induced by heavy mediator loops and the complete cross - sections of the s- and t - channel annihilation of the dark matter .",
    "the effective lagrangian generated by loops of heavy mediators is generically invariant under sm and has a non - linear ( stueckelberg ) realization for @xmath0 , for the following reason .",
    "if the mediator masses are invariant under both the sm and the @xmath0 gauge symmetry , the induced operators would be gauge invariant in the usual sense .",
    "if the mediator masses are however generated by the breaking of @xmath7 , in the broken phase below the mass of the heavy higgs @xmath12 breaking @xmath7 , the symmetry is still present but realized a la stueckelberg .",
    "indeed , in the limit where @xmath12 is much heavier than the @xmath0 , in the effective theory we keep only the axionic component of the original @xmath0 higgs field @xmath18 .",
    "we define the dimensionless axion @xmath19 in what follows .",
    "the axion transforms non - linearly under @xmath10 transformations @xmath20    the exact lagrangian , describing all the microscopic physics , including the mediator fields @xmath11 , is then of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the standard model lagrangian and where @xmath23 .",
    "this lagrangian is indeed invariant under ( [ inv1 ] ) , with non - linear shifts of the axion @xmath24 crucial for restauring gauge invariance .",
    "if the original high - energy lagrangian is anomaly - free and the sm fermions are neutral under @xmath0 , then the mediators have to form an anomaly - free set .",
    "we are considering this class of models in most of this paper . in this case , the induced effective operators are gauge invariant a la stueckelberg . throughout the paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to cp even operators for simplicity . in the case where the mediators are not an anomaly - free set",

    "if @xmath36 has its natural one - loop value , then its effects are more important than most of the ones we will discuss in what follows .",
    "this is the most plausible case and was investigated in many details within the last years . in what follows",
    ", we will place ourselves in the mostly ` orthogonal ' case in which @xmath36 is small enough such that its effects are subleading compared to the dimension - six operators .",
    "this is the case , for example , if messengers are in complete representations of a non - abelian gauge group ( gut groups are of course the best such candidates ) , or if the mediators have no hypercharge .",
    "then , at low energy , the mediators being integrated out give rise to a new effective lagrangian @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the new effective operators generated separately in the sm gauge sector and @xmath0 one , whereas in @xmath40 we collect all the induced terms mixing @xmath0 with the standard model .",
