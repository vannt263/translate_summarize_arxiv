    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are believed to be powered by accretion onto compact objects with masses @xmath1 @xcite ; such objects will inevitably collapse into supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) on short timescales @xcite .",
    "early work @xcite conjectured that these agn were fueled by the tidal disruption of stars passing too close to the sbhs , and that sbhs could grow to their observed masses by accreting debris from such tidal disruption events ( tdes ) .",
    "although sbhs are now believed to grow primarily by accreting gas driven into galactic centers by tidal torques during galactic mergers @xcite , interest in tdes was renewed when it was realized that they could power bright flares lasting several years in otherwise quiescent galaxies @xcite .",
    "the roentgensatellit ( rosat ) observed such a flare in soft x - rays in ngc 5905 , a galaxy with no previous indication of nuclear activity @xcite . a systematic survey for x - ray flares within the rosat all - sky survey discovered five such events , implying a rate of @xmath2 galaxy@xmath3 yr@xmath3 consistent with the predicted rate of tdes @xcite .",
    "five additional tde candidates were discovered in the x - ray by the xmm - newton slew survey @xcite .",
    "tdes emit in the uv and optical as well ; several tde candidates discovered in the uv by the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) were found to have optical counterparts in the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey and panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) medium deep survey @xcite .",
    "two new tde candidates were identified through a series of rigorous cuts on the many optical transients found in stripe 82 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ; this implies that deeper , higher - cadence surveys such as that which will be undertaken by the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) could find thousands of tdes per year @xcite .",
    "tdes can also be observed in hard x - rays if they launch jets pointed towards us ; the events sw j1644 + 57 @xcite and sw j2058 + 05 @xcite discovered by the burst alert telescope on the _ swift _ satellite are conjectured to be such relativistic tidal disruption flares .",
    "one of the most exciting applications of observing tdes is the possibility of measuring sbh spins .",
    "the magnitude of a sbh s spin depends sensitively on the manner in which that sbh was assembled .",
    "a nonspinning sbh can attain a dimensionless spin @xmath4 after increasing its mass by a factor of @xmath5 through the coherent accretion of gas in the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "if a sbh grows instead through the chaotic accretion of misaligned clumps of gas @xcite , its spin magnitude could be much more modest ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "studies of sbh spins in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation indicate that a wide range of distributions are possible , depending on one s assumptions about the relative contributions of coherent accretion , chaotic accretion , and binary mergers to sbh spin evolution @xcite .",
    "simulations in which gas is accreted coherently or chaotically lead to dimensionless spin distributions sharply peaked about unity or zero respectively at all redshifts .",
    "real sbhs probably grow through an as yet undetermined combination of coherent and chaotic accretion , suggesting that almost any distribution of sbh spins is possible .",
    "this considerable theoretical uncertainty emphasizes the urgent need for greater observational constraints .",
    "fortunately , there has recently been tremendous progress measuring sbh spins using x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "if an agn accretion disk is surrounded by a hot , nonthermal corona , a portion of the hard x - rays emitted by this corona may be reprocessed by the colder disk @xcite .",
    "this hard x - ray irradiation will cause the 6.4 kev iron k@xmath7 line in the disk to fluoresce , with much of the flux in this line coming from the innermost regions around the sbh @xcite .",
    "the shape and variability of the line profile is sensitive to general - relativistic effects including sbh spin .",
    "observations of fluorescent iron k@xmath7 lines with the xmm - newton and suzaku satellites have been used to constrain the spin magnitudes of eight nearby agn , three of which are near maximal ( @xmath8 ) while the remaining five are intermediate ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .    despite these impressive new results ,",
    "this approach to measuring sbh spins is inherently limited to highly accreting agn whose spins may not reflect the sbh population as a whole .",
    "tdes provide an opportunity to measure the spins of a less biased sbh population , and spin estimates based on tdes should have different systematic errors than previous approaches .",
    "if a tde launches jets that extract rotational energy from the sbh via the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite , the observed peak x - ray luminosity of the tde can be used to constrain the sbh spin magnitude @xcite . if the jet is misaligned with the sbh spin , the lense - thirring effect @xcite will cause the jet axis to precess , modulating the observed x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "both of these approaches have been applied to the two _ swift _ events j1644 + 57 and j2058 + 05 .",
    "mean sbh spins may also be estimated from the observed tde rate @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on yet another way in which tdes can be used to constrain sbh spins , through the observed light curve of individual events",

    "newtonian orbits with specific binding energy @xmath16 have orbital period @xmath17 implying that the debris will return to pericenter a time @xmath18 after tidal disruption @xcite . internal shocks during this pericenter passage will cause the debris to settle into an axisymmetric torus on this timescale . if the viscosity is high enough to allow accretion on a similar or shorter timescale , eq .",

    "the light curves of several tde candidates have been reasonably well fit by @xmath0 power laws in the optical , uv , and x - ray @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 dependence of tde light curves rests on two assumptions : the constancy of @xmath20 and the validity of the newtonian relation ( [ e : binper ] ) between the specific binding energy and orbital period .",
    "the first of these assumptions was investigated by lodato , king , and pringle @xcite ( hereafter lkp09 ) , who found that @xmath20 did indeed depend on the adiabatic index @xmath22 of the tidally disrupted star .",

    "the imbh was nonspinning in the first simulation , and in the remaining five simulations had a spin with the same magnitude ( @xmath26 ) but different orientations with respect to the orbital angular momentum and initial position of the white dwarf .",
    "they found that the prompt accretion rate at @xmath27  s after tidal disruption could vary by almost two orders of magnitude as a function of spin direction .",

    ", we use the assumption that tidal debris moves on kerr geodesics to calculate mass accretion rates as a function of time throughout the full fallback regime .",

    "a simplified model of stellar tidal disruption in the newtonian limit is presented in sec . 2 of lkp09 .",
    "this model is premised on the existence of a clear hierarchy between the specific orbital kinetic energy @xmath33 of the initial star , the energy @xmath34 gained or lost during tidal disruption , and the self - binding energy @xmath35 of the star @xcite .",
    "these energy scales are given by    [ e : escales ] @xmath36    where @xmath12 is the pericenter and @xmath37 is the mass ratio .",
    "this hierarchy implies that to zeroth order in @xmath38 , the specific binding energy of a fluid element of the tidal debris is the same as that of the center of mass of the initial star . at @xmath39 ,",
    "a fluid element located at @xmath40 receives a correction to its specific energy @xmath41 where @xmath42 points from the black hole to the center of the star at pericenter , and vectors with hats above them are unit vectors .",

    "this precession may affect the timescale on which the tidal debris settles into an accretion disk , but this process is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "a second difference between kerr geodesics and newtonian orbits is that the radial period depends not only on the specific energy @xmath16 , as in eq .",

    "<S> a star orbiting a supermassive black hole can be tidally disrupted if the black hole s gravitational tidal field exceeds the star s self gravity at pericenter . </S>",
    "<S> some of this stellar tidal debris can become gravitationally bound to the black hole , leading to a bright electromagnetic flare with bolometric luminosity proportional to the rate at which material falls back to pericenter . in the newtonian limit </S>",
    "<S> , this flare will have a light curve that scales as @xmath0 if the tidal debris has a flat distribution in binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the time dependence of the black - hole mass accretion rate when tidal disruption occurs close enough the black hole that relativistic effects are significant . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for orbits with pericenters comparable to the radius of the marginally bound circular orbit , relativistic effects can double the peak accretion rate and halve the time it takes to reach this peak accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion rate depends on both the magnitude of the black - hole spin and its orientation with respect to the stellar orbit ; for orbits with a given pericenter radius in boyer - lindquist coordinates , a maximal black - hole spin anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum leads to the largest peak accretion rate . </S>"
