    "the world of finance provides a challenge to the modeling of stock price dynamics as a function of the most important market characteristics .",
    "the prices of financial markets depend on the state of the economy , recent news , stock trading regulations , and especially the mood of the market players . to describe stock price dynamics",
    ", one should develop a united analytic framework for behavior of market players and for market mechanisms that translate this behavior into actual prices of a stock and its options ( i.e. , future contracts with a profit that depends on the specific behavior of the stock price in the future ) .",
    "consequently , the modeling of stock markets is part of a more general problem of community opinion dynamics @xcite@xcite .",
    "the current prices of options are affected by demand and supply of the market players according to their beliefs regarding the future evolution of the prices .",
    "the future distribution of prices imagined by the market players might be revealed by the prices of the options@xcite@xcite .",
    "for instance , the greater expected change of the price of a stock , the greater the change in the price of the corresponding options that benefit from the raising market . financial markets supply a huge amount of historical prices of stocks and their options to analyze , including phenomena such as nationwide financial crises .",
    "an analysis of historical market prices clearly demonstrates abrupt changes that result in greater probabilities than in gaussian ( normal ) distributions for large price steps .",
    "the gaussian distribution is used as a reference because it is a cumulative result of many random independent contributions and it is widespread .",
    "deviations from the normal distribution are known as fat - tail distribution@xcite . moreover ,",
    "the distribution of future prices imagined by the market players according to the options prices possesses the same fat - tail distribution .",
    "non - gaussian behavior of option prices is called volatility smile or skew@xcite .",
    "it is notable that the volatility smile developed significantly after the financial crisis of 1987@xcite .",
    "the abrupt changes of the prices indicate complex phenomena among the market players such as communication@xcite , herding@xcite@xcite , or crashophobia@xcite .",
    "these phenomena result in a collective response of the market players that might explain abrupt ( non - gaussian ) changes of the prices@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "their connection to markets makes these phenomena of great practical importance .",
    "stock players are historically separated into bulls and bears that act in favor of growing or reducing the market , respectively .",
    "this analogy unites the problem of the market players with the models of opinion dynamics@xcite@xcite .",
    "collective behavior such as herding emerges due to the social influence between the players@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .    to test different models of voting or opinion dynamics against real data of the market prices ,",
    "one should link the price of a stock with the amount of bulls and bears in the market players community .",
    "previous attempts assumed a mere linear dependence of the price or change of the price on disbalance between the bulls and the bears in the community@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these assumptions generate prices with a fat - tail distribution in the case of herding of the market players .",
    "a comparison with real data and an explanation of the real phenomenon of volatility smile , however , require further clarification of the correct dependence between the stock price and the parameters of the market players , such as herding and social influence .",
    "this article presents a general description of stock and options price formation as an opinion dynamics of the market players to be either bulls or bears .",
    "the model shows a good fit to real data of option prices , both of stocks and indices . according to our results , the non - gaussian distribution of prices depends on social influence between the market players and the initial collective memory on distribution of bears and bulls .",
    "moreover , social influence and collective memory discriminate two different patterns , skew and smile , of the option prices .",
    "the model describes both gaussian and non - gaussian distributions , allowing a discussion of how the latter might appear as it happened during the 1987 financial crisis .",
    "we argue that a vote to price connection may be independent of exact market mechanisms .",
    "we demonstrate market modeling using the seminal black - scholes model for pricing options@xcite@xcite .",
    "this model relies on two major assumptions .",
    "the first is that the relative change in the price of a stock @xmath0 in a time step @xmath1 is the sum of the deterministic change in monetary value and a gaussian stochastic process that describes contribution of the market players : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a prime rate , @xmath4 is a wigner process ( @xmath5 is a random variable of normal distribution with mean @xmath6 and standard deviation @xmath7 ) . the parameter @xmath8 is called volatility .    the volatility @xmath8 of the black - scholes model solely describes the result of the decision making and trades of the market players .",
    "the stochastic process ( [ eq : bsmain ] ) corresponds to diffusion in @xmath9 space @xmath10 and , therefore , leads to a log normal distribution of the prices : @xmath11 high values of volatility @xmath8 , therefore , correspond to greater changes of the stock prices at a given period of time .",
    "the second assumption of the black - scholes model is the non - arbitrage principle , also called an assumption of the effective market , which allows one to link the dynamics of the stock prices with the price of future contracts , for instance put or call options .",
    "consider a plain vanilla call option , which is the right to buy a stock @xmath12 at some strike price @xmath13 after some maturity time @xmath14 .",
    "the value of a call option @xmath15 with strike price @xmath13 as a function of the corresponding stock price @xmath12 at the maturity day is : @xmath16 this expression describes the possibility to buy stock at price @xmath13 and immediately sell it at price @xmath12 .",
    "the value of the option is its average return multiplied by the expected change in monetary value until the maturity time : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the expected distribution of stock value at maturity time @xmath19 .",
    "the distribution of stock value is unequivocally linked to the dynamics of the stock price .",
    "any deviation from ( [ option1 ] ) leads to arbitrage possibilities between investments in stock and its options .",
    "the black - scholes model describes the future distribution of stock prices @xmath20 together with corresponding prices of the options @xmath21 as the functions of the single free parameter , volatility @xmath8 , see eq .",
    "( [ option1 ] ) .",
    "one might , therefore , calibrate volatility against current prices of options using eq .",
    "( [ option1 ] ) .",
    "this calibration is essential to use @xmath22 for pricing exotic or non - tradable options and to get unobservable parameters such as @xmath23 for hedging .",
    "however , the calibration of the black - scholes model demonstrates that single parameter volatility @xmath8 does not suffice to describe the dynamics of the observed market prices .",
    "the real prices of options are presented by the implied volatility surface @xmath24 , which describes the deviation of the reality from the black - scholes model@xcite .",
    "implied volatility is defined for each strike price @xmath13 and maturity time @xmath19 as the volatility of the black - scholes model that corresponds to the current price of option @xmath25 : @xmath26 where the black - scholes value of options is defined by eq .",
    "( [ option1 ] ) .",
    "the volatility surface is flat in case of a black - scholes market since eq .",
    "( [ option1 ] has the same solution @xmath27 for all values of @xmath13 and @xmath19 . in reality , the volatility surface is far from being flat , indicating a non - gaussian behavior of the stock price .",
    "after the financial crisis of 1987 , implied volatility as a function of strike price @xmath13 for a given maturity time @xmath19 generally demonstrates smile or skew behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this deviation from flat black - scholes volatility indicates that stock price dynamics is not gaussian .",
    "skew is more present in indices that are averages of many stocks , and smile is more common for stocks .    to describe the volatility smile phenomenon , one should correct the stochastic process ( [ eq : bsmain ] ) to include non - gaussian dynamics .",
    "the main corrections include stochastic@xcite , local volatility@xcite@xcite , and additional stochastic processes such as jumps or non - gaussian behavior due to correlated behavior of the players ( opinion aggregation)@xcite .",
    "the stochastic volatility approach assumes volatility @xmath8 to be a stochastic process .",
    "local volatility is the assumption that @xmath28 is a function of stock price and maturity time .",
    "these two corrections possess high practical value .",
    "however , they lack reasonable justification and can not explain the nature of the volatility smile phenomenon .",
    "human parameters such as crashofobia or herding are difficult to quantify and to compare with real data .",
    "that leads to arguments regarding the true nature of the volatility smile and the corresponding dynamic of market players .",
    "market micromodeling using agent simulations is an alternative approach for deriving the stochastic process of a stock@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "a market player is modeled to the level of its strategy to buy and sell available assets .",
    "market mechanisms then translate the actions of many players into changes of the prices .",
    "an advantage of this approach is a clear understanding of all processes on all levels .",
    "a disadvantage is the great number of parameters and the difficulty to define completely human trading as the actions of an agent in simulation .",
    "this work presents price dynamics as a function of the limited number of parameters with special emphasis on social influence ( herding ) between the market players@xcite@xcite .",
    "we present an alternative way to network topology to define social responsivity that is better integrated in classic modeling of market prices by stochastic processes@xcite .",
    "the advantages of our method include both positive and negative social influence , boundaries , and dynamics .",
    "we achieve a good fit of the model with real market data and answer some - long standing questions , such as the origin and especially the difference between smile and skew in implied volatility surfaces .",
    "when social influence is zero , our model converges to the black - scholes model result .",
    "this is due to the assumption that players without mutual effect compose a gaussian black - scholes market .",
    "the model is suitable for parallel monte carlo simulations . a graphical processing unit ( gpu )",
    "was used to calibrate the model s parameters to fit real data .",
    "the model may be optimized further for practical needs .",
    "next , we describe the model in detail , present the results of fitting real volatility surfaces , and discuss the basic assumptions , implications , and relations of our model to other works .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : bookall ]    the fit of implied volatilities with 1 month and 15 month maturity times is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig17 ] .",
    "the fit of the smile mainly depends on the initial position of the market players .",
    "the skew depends more on imposed herding limits .",
    "a stronger limit can bring implied volatility to almost flat black - scholes form .",
    "the strong smile at 1 day maturity can be fitted ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12 ] ) , though it requires extreme values of volatility relative to other maturity times ( see table [ tab : bookall ] .",
    "the initial position @xmath29 indicates that the market players anti - correlated with the market .",
    "following results [ tab : bookall ] , the initial position of the community converges to the region of small social influence with maturity time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] ) .",
    "it is clearly separated into two groups of early and later maturity times .",
    "herding limits as a function of time according to table [ tab : bookall ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : booki ] .",
    "the limits converge to @xmath6 with time and bring the market players community closer to the black - scholes limit .",
    "the lower absolute value of @xmath30 than @xmath31 at later maturity times indicates a positive correlation between the market behavior and players predictions .",
    "market players dynamics , following the results for spx indices and vod stock , at early maturity times , may possess a high value of social influence .",
    "this is reasonable , since information about the current state of the community is preserved for a short time into the future .",
    "longer maturity times are characterized by strong herding limits .",
    "the initial position of the population lacks almost any social influence value .",
    "indeed , no memory is preserved for a long time and , consequently , the market envisioned by its players converges to the black - scholes limit with maturity time .",
    "to corroborate the basic assumptions of the model , let us compare the implied volatility surfaces of the spx index , the vod stock , and the results of this work .",
    "the model , after appropriate calibration of its parameters , successfully fits real implied volatility surfaces of both smile and skew types .",
    "the model s parameters describe the community of the market players together with the market that transforms the players action into observable prices .",
    "the obtained description of the market , together with players community , is analyzed in light of the model assumptions and common sense .",
    "the assumption of the black - scholes ( log normal ) price dynamics in the case of random ( zero social influence ) acts of the market players is supported both by properties of real implied volatility surfaces and the results of this work . the properties of market players for the purpose of evaluation options with greater maturity times are less correlated with their current values .",
    "indeed , implied volatilities converge to the black - scholes `` flat '' form with maturity time .",
    "the same happens for calibrated herding limits that converge to their black - scholes limit @xmath32 with maturity time ( see figure [ fig : booki ] ) .",
    "the assumptions of market mechanism in the form of deterministic function ( without a stochastic term ) are supported by the ability to fit real implied volatility surfaces .",
    "each parameter of the model is justified and essential . moreover",
    ", the model requires an additional heuristic parameter @xmath33 to match reality .",
    "this parameter , however , is justified as market s reduction of market players volatility by regulations for stability and crisis prevention .",
    "the distinctive explanations for skew and smile phenomena as limits and initial values of herding , respectively , agree with previous association of skew and smile implied volatility surfaces with indices and stocks .",
    "the index is an average price of multiple stocks and , therefore , better presents the average properties of the market .",
    "consequently , in the case of indices , the limits on herding should be stronger and the dependence on initial value of herding is low .",
    "contrary , individual stock might possess broader limits on herding and its value for short maturity times .",
    "upper @xmath31 and lower @xmath30 limits on herding correspond to the maximum of the correlation and anti - correlation of market players opinions , respectively .",
    "the greater @xmath31 the greater the possibility of collective phenomena of the players .",
    "the definition of market player strategies using conditional probabilities stems from similar techniques of the game theory@xcite .",
    "the question of optimal strategy and its evolutionary stability remains under discussion@xcite .",
    "an analysis of the market may contribute to this discussion due to the huge amount of available data .",
    "on the other hand , there is also an interesting discussion whether evolution is relevant for the market players@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the model s limitations and drawbacks are the following : the transaction costs and other players states but bull or bear were not taken into account ; equal financial weight of the players was assumed ; and the prime interest rate was omitted in the voting process of the market players and considered only as monetary value change during calculating implied volatility .",
    "the prime converges close to its real value , however , if assumed to be a free parameter .",
    "in addition , we did not take into account near neighbors topological constraint .",
    "a single market player may affect any other player with a limit on the total amount of social influence it generates .",
    "the excessive communication abilities of the present time and a good match of the model results with real prices justify this approach .",
    "this work predicts the stochastic process for price dynamics that depends on a small number of well - justified parameters .",
    "it is an advantage over approaches of local@xcite and stochastic volatilities@xcite .",
    "the latter together with completely heuristic descriptions of implied volatility may be advantageous for practical needs by their speed .",
    "our model , however , can be accelerated by further massive parallelization and , in general , is comparable to any monte - carlo based trading tools .",
    "the results of this work are potentially relevant for any agent - based simulation@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite because the model s major assumptions are independent of the market microstructure",
    ". moreover , the model is impervious to modifications .",
    "the need for a function that transforms the voting process to log normal requires the terms @xmath3 and @xmath8 to depend on each other and prevents their arbitrary modifications . moreover , neglecting ( [ gam1 ] ) and writing the process in the form @xmath34 leads to unrealistic bounded expression for the price ",
    "vote relation @xmath35 instead of ( [ f0 ] ) .",
    "the results of this work support the relation of information technologies ( it ) contribution to the financial crisis of 1987 .",
    "the implied volatilities of the spx index acquired significant skew during this crisis@xcite .",
    "according to our model , it indicates the growth of possible social influence of the market players .",
    "the latter might be a consequence of extensive it technology modification of the markets and trading at that time .",
    "it corroborates that information - like phenomena are the cause rather than the consequence of the crisis .",
    "the herding of the market players might be a new tradable parameter , similar to the volatility index ( vix)@xcite , which describes the past values of market s volatility .",
    "on the contrary , in this work , herding describes possible future developments of the market players community . it may be an important market indicator for crisis analysis@xcite .",
    "moreover , herding can be estimated by other means from internet responses and artificial market experiments for comparison with the market , or even for predicting the market behavior .",
    "we presented a framework for modeling the market prices dynamics based on opinion dynamics and herding in the trading community .",
    "this framework uses the social influence and mutual information between the players as a quantitative measure of the herding effect and corresponding deviation of the prices from the black - scholes model .",
    "the derived relation between opinion dynamics and price formation is general and argued to be independent of exact market mechanism . the calculated option prices fit real market data and can be useful for trading and hedging .",
    "in addition , the estimated herding from market data can be compared with herding from other sources such as artificial markets , news , or social networks ."
