    "the skyrme model @xcite is one of the fundamental contemporary mathematical physics models , and it finds applications in different fields of physics ranging from the theory of elementary particles to solid state physics . the model was originally proposed in terms of four scalar fields taking values on the three - dimensional sphere @xmath3 .",
    "the lagrangian of the model was also written in terms of elements of the algebra @xmath4 because the sphere @xmath3 is diffeomorphic to the group @xmath5 as a manifold . because the fundamental and the second homotopy groups of unitary groups @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and spheres @xmath8 , @xmath9 , are trivial , one- and two - dimensional topologically nontrivial solutions of the corresponding models do not exist . in such a parameterization of the skyrme model , topologically",

    "topologically nontrivial solutions for higher homotopy groups appear in the @xmath16 model , where the second homotopy group is nontrivial , @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding static solutions with nontrivial topological charge were found and analyzed in @xcite .    as already noted , the lagrangian for the skyrme model can be written in terms of the @xmath4 algebra elements . because the algebras for the @xmath5 and @xmath0 groups are isomorphic",
    ", the skyrme model can be considered the @xmath0 model with the group manifold itself being the target space . for this , we use the known ( see , i.g . , @xcite ) , but not widely used , explicit parameterization of the rotation group @xmath0 , i.e. , we work with the three - dimensional group manifold directly .",
    "topologically nontrivial solutions appear here , even in the one - dimensional case , because the fundamental group of the rotation group @xmath0 is nontrivial @xmath18 .",
    "we explicitly find the corresponding static solutions .",
    "they are analyzed and compared with the static solutions of the @xmath16 model .",

    "it is well known that the @xmath0 group manifold is diffeomorphic to the three - dimensional projective space @xmath19 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this allows generalizing the skyrme model to the case of arbitrary projective spaces over the field of real numbers where the target space is an arbitrary projective space @xmath20 .",

    "the lagrangian for an @xmath21 model depends on @xmath26 fields @xmath27 , and is invariant under local discrete transformations @xmath28 .",

    "it is easy to observe the symmetry of the rotation matrix by noting that the ratio @xmath46 defining the direction of vector @xmath42 remains unchanged under an arbitrary shift , @xmath47 an element of the rotation group is therefore parameterized by a point of the euclidean space @xmath48 with the only equivalence relation @xmath49 here , the uncertainty at zero is resolved along radial directions @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",

    "different rotations correspond to different points , and the antipodal points of the boundary sphere must be identified because rotations through the angles @xmath25 and @xmath56 about a fixed axis yield the same result .",
    "the full group of three - dimensional rotations @xmath30 consists of two disconnected components : orthogonal matrices with positive @xmath57 and negative @xmath58 determinants .",
    "elements of the full group @xmath30 are parameterized , for example , by algebra elements ( [ epeans ] ) as @xmath59 we note that there are two group elements @xmath60 , one from each component , which correspond to an element of the algebra @xmath61 .",
    "the inverse matrices have the form @xmath62 i.e. , they correspond to the inverse vector @xmath63 . in other words , the inverse group element corresponds to the rotation of the euclidean space about the same axis through the opposite angle .",
    "contraction of the matrix @xmath64 with the vector @xmath65 yields @xmath66 this means that the vector @xmath42 is the eigenvector of orthogonal matrices with the eigenvalues @xmath67 . in other words , rotations",

    "we consider ( [ eskact ] ) as the action for the @xmath0 model using the parameterization of the rotation group from the previous section .",
    "we note that these models are not equivalent .",
    "substituting the explicit expression for @xmath79 in terms of the group parameters ( [ ealgrs ] ) yields the lagrangian for three independent scalar fields @xmath42 , @xmath80 where we introduce the notation for the scalar product @xmath81 in this expression , repeated greek indices imply summation with the minkowski metric tensor@xmath82 , and we do not distinguish lower and upper indices for simplicity .",

    "the latter transformation implies that the length of the vector @xmath48 at each point @xmath84 can be changed by a constant value divisible by @xmath85 . at the same time , this discrete transformation is local because the direction of the vector @xmath42 changes from point to point . by virtue of this invariance",

    "moreover , all points of the boundary sphere must be identified .",
    "this is the second equivalence relation in the parameter space , @xmath100 the extra equivalence relation is due to the absence of the third term in ( [ esutgr ] ) as compared with ( [ elsogr ] ) .",
    "it is another difference from the rotation - group case , where only antipodal points on the boundary sphere are identified , which is taken into account in equivalence relation ( [ eqrsog ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that there are no other equivalence relations in the parameter space except ( [ eqrsut ] ) and ( [ equspe ] )",
    ".    it can be easily verified that the lagrangian for the skyrme model has the same form ( [ elaomn ] ) for both the groups @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",

    "the @xmath0 model can be naturally generalized to the projective space @xmath2 of arbitrary dimension because the group @xmath0 , as a manifold , is diffeomorphic to the three - dimensional real projective space @xmath19 .",
    "this allows defining a new class of projective models depending on eight arbitrary periodic functions of one argument .",
    "topologically nontrivial one - dimensional solutions may exist in all these models because @xmath195 for @xmath196 .",
    "the @xmath0 model can be used in the geometric theory of defects @xcite . the riemann  cartan geometry can be used to describe the static distribution of dislocations and disclinations in elastic media .",
    "the corresponding action is invariant under general coordinate transformations and local @xmath0 rotations .",
    "the equations of elasticity theory were recently used to fix the coordinate system @xcite .",
    "this allowed including the classical elasticity theory in the geometric approach as a limiting case where defects are absent . the @xmath0 model discussed in the present paper",
    "can be used to fix local @xmath0 rotations because it is not invariant under these rotations . in this case , the geometric theory of defects yields the @xmath0 model in the absence of disclinations .",
    "for example , the lorenz gauge for the @xmath0 connection results in the equations of the principal chiral field for the group @xmath0 in the absence of disclinations . in the limit of no dislocations and disclinations ,",
    "the geometric defect theory can therefore be reduced to the equations of the elasticity theory for the shift vector and to the equations of the principal chiral field for the spin structure .",
