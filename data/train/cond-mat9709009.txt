    "the asymptotic properties of products of random matrices play an important role in many physical problems @xcite . in models like disordered one  dimensional magnetic systems they describe the thermodynamic quantities such as free energy or correlations , for localization of electronic waves in random potentials they are related to the transport properties , see also @xcite .",
    "such products also appear in the context of chaotic dynamical systems characterizing the divergence of neighboring trajectories .",
    "although there are many known results on products of random matrices , some of them even mathematically rigorous , we want to present a general replica transfer matrix method .",

    "predict the concept of replica symmetry breaking which is related to a highly nontrivial ultrametric structure of states in the low temperature phase .",
    "the existence of replica symmetry breaking in low dimensional systems is not yet clear , see e.g. the argumentation of @xcite . in @xcite a replica approach to one  dimensional disordered ising models was presented .",
    "although there does not exist any phase transition at nonzero temperature , a rich replica structure could be observed leading to a natural critrion for replica symmetry breaking in this special system which is not related to parisi s replica symmetry breaking scheme for mean  field models .",
    "this criterion is based on the representation structure of the permutation group and could be deduced to a large extent with rigorous methods . in the present paper",
    "we generalize the approach of @xcite to infinite products of random matrices of finite dimension .",
    "we mainly use the language of statistical mechanics , i.e. the random matrices are considered as transfer matrices of one  dimensional models with finite discrete degrees of freedom and random short  range interactions .",
    "we show that the representation theoretic approach to replica symmetry breaking is quite general and can be formulated without specifying a particular one  dimensional model .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the replicated transfer matrix . for the analysis we need several tools from the representation theory of the symmetric group .",
    "these are presented in the third section . in sec .",
    "iv the replica symmetric representation space is considered and the free energy is calculated .",
    "the connection between non ",
    "trivial representations of the symmetric group and connected correlation functions is analyzed in sec .",
    "v. they will provide a natural criterion for replica symmetry breaking . in the last section we give a summary and outlook .",
    "several appendices contain longer calculations or proofs .",
    "we consider @xmath1 @xmath0 matrices @xmath2 drawn from a single probability distribution @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is any positive integer . in the case of an one  dimensional model with random hamiltonian @xmath5 ( @xmath6 can take @xmath4 different values ) and",
    "inverse temperature @xmath7 they are given by @xmath8 .",
    "for a general distribution these matrices do not commute .",
    "therefore we can not find a common system of eigenvectors . in order to calculate self  averaging quantities such as the free energy we introduce as usual the n - fold replicated and disorder averaged partition function , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the average with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath11 the kronecker product of matrices . with this relation",
    "we are able to replace the product of @xmath1 random @xmath0 matrices by the @xmath1-th power of a single @xmath12 matrix which can be analyzed using standard transfer matrix techniques : we have to find expressions for the eigenvalues of @xmath13 which enable an analytic continuation in @xmath14 . the free energy is then given by @xmath15 which is dominated by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath16 for @xmath17",
    ". several correlation length can be described by smaller eigenvalues of the same matrix .    to calculate this",
    ", some notations will be introduced .",
    "the original matrices @xmath18 act on a @xmath4dimensional vector space @xmath19 . as a basis we chose any orthonormalized set of @xmath4 vectors and denote these by @xmath20 .",
    "consequently @xmath16 is a linear operator defined on the @xmath14fold tensor product @xmath21 of @xmath19 with itself which has dimension @xmath22 .",
    "the orthonormalized basis - vectors of this space are chosen naturally as @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath16 are then given by @xmath27 for any two basis vectors of @xmath21 .",
    "the average over @xmath3 produces interactions between the replicas .",
    "nevertheless the replicas are completely equivalent , a renumbering does not change the matrix @xmath16 .",
    "this leads to a symmetry of the transfer matrix under replica permutations , i.e. to replica symmetry of @xmath16 .",
    "the action of any permutations is given by the @xmath22 dimensional representation @xmath28 of the symmetric group @xmath29 : @xmath30 whose operator product with @xmath16 commutes , @xmath31 a direct consequence of equation ( [ commute ] ) is the closure of any eigenspace of @xmath16 under permutations , these eigenspaces define a subrepresentations of @xmath28 which in the most general case are irreducible .",
    "further reducibilities would be a hint to a further hidden symmetry .",
    "consider an element @xmath32 of the group algebra @xmath33 of @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath32 is a linear combination of permutations @xmath34 .",
    "due to ( [ commute ] ) and the linearity of the action of the transfer matrix on @xmath21 it also commutes with @xmath16 .",
    "the space @xmath35 is therefore invariant under action of @xmath16 .",
    "if we are able to construct elements of @xmath33 projecting @xmath21 to a proper subspace we can thus achieve a block diagonalization of @xmath16 by its restriction to @xmath36 and to its orthogonal complement @xmath37 .",
    "in this section we review some properties of the symmetric group and its irreducible representations .",
    "these are well  studied and numerous excellent presentations can be found , e.g. in @xcite . here",

    "a representation is called completely reducible iff it can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations . this decomposition is unique up to isomorphisms .",
    "our @xmath28 defined in the previous section is completely reducible .",
    "the irreducible representations of @xmath29 are classified by the so  called _ standard young tableaus_. each young tableau is characterized by a partition of @xmath14 , i.e. a set of integers @xmath43 , fulfilling @xmath44 .",
    "one arranges m rows of length @xmath45 as shown in the figure and fills the boxes with the integers @xmath46 .",
    "the tableau is called standard iff the entries of the boxes are increasing within every row and within every column , see e.g. the figure .",
    "at first we define the row symmetrizer @xmath47 } = \\prod_{a=1}^{m } { \\mbox{sym}}_a$ ] with @xmath48 being the sum of all permutations within the @xmath49th row .",

    "a basis of the irreducible representation space can be constructed by applying all permutations to @xmath57}|v\\rangle$ ] and selecting a maximal linearly independent subset .",
    "every standard young tableau gives a different irreducible representation , those corresponding to the same partition @xmath59 $ ] but different entries are isomorphic . depending on the structure of @xmath39 , also the action of the same young operator on different vectors from @xmath40 can give different irreducible subrepresentations of @xmath39 .",
    "every irreducible subrepresentation can be constructed in the prescribed way .",
    "another notion needed in the following is that of the _ associate _ representation . for any irreducible representation given by a standard young tableau with partition @xmath60 $ ] it is given by the _ transposed _ standard young tableau ,",
    "i.e. the rows become the columns and vice versa .",

    "an example is given in the following figure .",
    "we now return to the problem of finding the eigenvalues of the replicated and disorder  averaged transfer matrix @xmath16 . at the end of the second section we showed that the space @xmath64 is invariant with respect to @xmath16 for every @xmath65 .",
