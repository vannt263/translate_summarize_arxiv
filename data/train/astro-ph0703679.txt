    "the blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18 is one of the most intriguing objects in the local universe .",
    "it has the lowest nebular metallicity of all known star forming galaxies z=1/30 - 1/50 z@xmath0 ( depending on the metallicity scale ) , and it has long been regarded as a possible example of a galaxy undergoing its first burst of star formation , hence a local analog of primordial galaxies in the distant universe .",
    "previous hst observations with wfpc2 and nicmos ( aloisi et al . , 1999 , ostlin et al . , 2000",
    ") detected agb stars tracing an underlying population about 0.5 gyr old .",
    "however , izotov & thuan , ( 2004 , it04 ) failed to reveal the galaxy rgb tip on their acs@hst data , thus suggesting that izw18 does not host an old population .",
    "since current estimates for the distance of izw18 are very uncertain , it may be possible that izw18 rgb tip was not detected because the galaxy is farther away than previously thought .",
    "we have used our acs@hst deep time - series data of izw18 , to measure the galaxy distance with the ccs .",
    "the proprietary acs@hst data were combined with it04 images , reaching a total time baseline of about 2.5 years .",
    "photometric reductions were performed using the allframe package ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) .",
    "variable stars were detected using both the optimal image subtraction technique ( isis 2.2 , alard 2000 ) and the welch & stetson ( 1993 ) variability index .",
    "we have identified 24 variable star candidates ( triangles in panel a ) , fig .",
    "analysis of the light curves is in progress .",
    "the @xmath1 light curves of a cc with period of 8.8 d ( star # 4306 ) are shown in fig .",
    "1 ( panel b ) .     light curves for a p=8.8 d cc ( see open circles in panel a ) . , title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=207 ]   light curves for a p=8.8 d cc ( see open circles in panel a ) . , title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=207 ]    new theoretical nonlinear pulsation models of ccs at the metallicity of izw18 ( z=0.0004 , y=0.24 ) have been computed , ( see marconi et al .",
    "2005 for details on the pulsation code ) to constrain the metallicity dependence of the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation in the low metallicity regime .",
    "the effect of different assumptions in the mixing length parameter ( l / hp=1.5 - 2 ) on the classical pulsation relations ( plc , wesenheit and pl ) and on the theoretical light curves has been investigated . at this low metallicity ,",
    "the effect of increasing the convection efficiency is negligible on the light curve amplitude , but causes a decrease in effective temperature width of the instability strip .",
    "the metallicity effect on the pl relations is negligible in this metal - poor range .",
    "the distance modulus of izw18 was determined by applying both the theoretical and the empirical approach to our most reliable ccs ( namely stars : # 8431 and 4306 ) : 1 ) our theoretical wesenheit relation ( fiorentino et al . 2007 , in preparation ) gives : @xmath2 = 31.28 @xmath3 0.26 mag ; 2 ) ogle s empirical pl - relation for the lmc ( udalski et al .",
    "1999 ) : gives @xmath2 = 30.71 @xmath3 0.29 mag , for an assumed distance modulus for the lmc of 18.5 mag .",
    "if we take into account the metallicity correction , we find : 1 ) a decrease of the distance modulus to : @xmath2=30.40 @xmath3 0.29 mag if the empirical correction by kennicut et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is adopted ; 2 ) an increase of the distance modulus to @xmath2 = 31.01 @xmath3 0.29 mag , if we extrapolate to the metallicity of izw18 the theoretical correction by fiorentino et al ."
