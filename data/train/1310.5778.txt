    "rna is one of the fundamental biopolymers .",
    "it plays an important role in many biological functions  @xcite .",
    "each rna molecule is a heteropolymer consisting of the four different nucleotides a , u , g and c in a specific order called the primary structure of the molecule .",
    "these nucleotides have a strong propensity to form watson - crick ( i.e. , g  c and a ",
    "u ) base pairs .",
    "this pairing is achieved by the polymer bending back onto itself and thus forming intricate patterns of stems containing runs of base pairs stacked on top of each other connected by flexible linkers of unpaired nucleotides called a secondary structure  @xcite .",
    "these structures then fold up into specific three - dimensional ( tertiary ) structures which enable some rnas to perform catalytic functions while other rnas mainly function as templates for transmitting genomic information .    after an rna is transcribed in a cell ,",
    "it is subject to a multitude of rna processing , rna localization , and rna decay steps that together determine the fate of the molecule .",
    "these steps are regulated by interactions with rna binding proteins or small rnas such as micrornas  @xcite .",
    "control over the fate of an rna is known as post - transcriptional gene regulation and is an important component of information processing in a cell .",
    "information processing requires mechanisms that implement logical operations between inputs between various binding partners of an rna or in physical terms mechanisms by which the binding of one partner influences the binding of another partner ( in biochemistry often denoted as `` cooperativity '' between binding sites ) .",
    "considering the sizes of the binding partners and the distances between them , it has been speculated for long that the effective range of this interdependency of binding partners has to be much greater than the sizes of these binding partners , to integrate numerous binding partners on a long rna molecule .",
    "however , the detailed mechanisms of this interdependency between rna binding partners are still unclear .    here",
    ", we propose a possible mechanism for this long - range interdependency between binding sites based on the rna secondary structures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2nd - str ] ) .",
    "the main idea is that interactions between a single - stranded rna binding protein or a microrna and the rna require that all bases of the specific target binding site are unpaired .",
    "a successful rna - protein binding event therefore excludes some of the permitted configurations from the originally protein - free rna secondary structure ensemble .",
    "the whole ensemble of possible folding configurations thus has changed , and the probability of another protein or microrna to bind on the same rna at a different site will also change after the first successful binding .",
    "this leads to an rna structure mediated interdependency between binding sites .    in this paper",
    ", we consider only the case of two binding sites per rna molecule , which is the simplest system to investigate this phenomenon in .",
    "we define a linear correlation function between the binding partners bound to an rna molecule as the observable to quantify this interdependency , and investigate its properties with respect to the rna structures .",
    "we find that this linear correlation function decays algebraically as a function of the distance between two protein binding sites , @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the linear correlation function for the homopolymer state in the molten phase of rna secondary structures as well as for the heteropolymer state in the glass phase of rna @xcite .",
    "such algebraically decaying correlation function provides long - range interactions between binding proteins or micrornas on an rna .",
    "therefore , we show that long - range interdependency of binding sites that is necessary for the implementation of logical operations in post - transcriptional regulation is a generic property of rna secondary structures and does not require any direct protein - protein interactions .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : reviewrna2nd ] we first give a brief review of rna secondary structure , discussing its importance and constraints , and the reasons for focusing on it in our investigation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simplifiedrna ] we introduce how we model protein rna interactions .",
    "then , we investigate the linear correlation function quantifying interdependency of binding sites in the simplest model for rna secondary structure formation in sec .",
    "[ sec : sini_0 ] .",
    "the absence of such protein binding correlations in the simplest model motivates us to include an important aspect of secondary structure formations , namely loop cost , into the model in sec .",
    "[ sec : sini_no0 ] . in that section ,",
    "we establish that in the presence of a loop cost the linear correlation function between binding partners decays as a power - law with the distance between binding partners , symbolizing a long - range effect .",
    "this central finding of our manuscript is supported through analytical calculations in the molten phase of rna secondary structure and numerical calculations in the glass phase . in sec .",
    "[ sec : loop_size_dependence ] we show that this behavior is not altered when adding a size dependent loop penalty to the model .",
    "finally , we numerically establish a power - law behavior of the correlation function between rna - binding proteins using the vienna package  @xcite , which represents the state of the art of quantitative modeling of realistic rna secondary structures , in sec .",
    "[ sec : vienna ] before concluding the manuscript .",
    "several of the more technical aspects are relegated to the appendices .",
    "a secondary structure of an rna molecule describes its configuration as a base pairing pattern without specifying the three - dimensional arrangement of the molecule . in general ,",
    "rna molecules fold first into secondary structures which in turn fold into more complicated three - dimensional structures called tertiary structures . moreover , even in the context of a higher - order structure , base pairing , i.e. the secondary structure , is the major contribution to the total folding energy . thus , both from the dynamic and energetic point of view , secondary structure is the most important component of rna folding . therefore , it is appropriate to study secondary structures alone when trying to understand rna folding phenomena ; a long tradition in the field that we are also following here .",
    "each secondary structure is described by all of its formed base pairs , denoted as @xmath1 for a bond between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 nucleotide with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sequence length .",
    "different base pairs @xmath1 and @xmath6 are either independent ( @xmath7 ) or nested ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "pseudoknots , i.e. configurations with @xmath9 , are usually excluded to make the structures more tractable both analytically and numerically . in practice , this exclusion is reasonable : long pesudoknots are kinetically forbidden ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudoknot ] ) , and short ones do not contribute much to the total binding energy .",
    "moreover , because the rna backbone is highly charged and pseudoknots increase the density of the molecule , their formation is relatively disfavored in low - salt conditions @xcite and can even be  turned off \" in experiments to focus the study on the secondary structures @xcite .",
    "thus , pseudoknots are commonly considered part of the tertiary structure of rna and will be ignored in the rest of this paper .    in order to model rna secondary structures , each structure @xmath10 needs to be assigned a folding energy @xmath11 $ ] . to calculate the energy",
    "@xmath11 $ ] of a secondary structure @xmath10 , it is necessary to clarify the contributions from different constituents of the structure .",
    "it is a good approximation to consider these contributions as local , i.e. to calculate the total energy @xmath11 $ ] by summing over the contributions from each of the independent constituents , such as the stems and loops ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2nd - str ] ) .",
    "the dominant contribution from stems is the stacking energy , which is associated with two consecutive base - pair bonds and depends on the bases making up the stack .",
    "the contribution from a loop is more sophisticated .",
    "first , compared to a free chain , a loop of unpaired bases is entropically less favorable , and a free energy penalty , which depends on the loop length , has to be taken into account .",
    "second , an enthalpy cost is involved , e.g. , in bending the backbone for small loops and most importantly in the opening of a junction .",
    "the combination of these two costs has been measured as a substantial length - independent term for loop initialization plus a relatively smaller length - dependent term  @xcite . in a complete model for real rna ,",
    "all these contributions depend not only on the size of a loop but also on its type ( hairpin , interior , bulge , multiloop , see fig.[fig:2nd - str ] ) and sequence .    the partition function of an rna sequence with @xmath5 nucleotides is calculated by considering all its possible secondary structures , summing over all of them as @xmath12},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the set of all possible secondary structures for the given sequence @xcite , and @xmath14 follows the traditional variable definition in statistical physics .",
    "the set @xmath13 is not only constraint by the aforementioned secondary structure definition , but also constraint by the mechanical properties of the backbone of the rna molecule . for a real rna ,",
    "the width of the double helix prohibits the formation of loops with less then three free base pairs .",
    "all secondary structures including these small loops have to be excluded from @xmath13 . considering all these sequence- and structure - dependent factors ,",
    "the calculation of the partition function @xmath15 is complicated , requiring consideration of thousands of parameters , and therefore can only be handled numerically . in practice , the vienna package  @xcite implements such a complete model for the numerical calculation of thermodynamic properties of rna molecules .    for theoretical discussions , however , often simplified models are used to study generic properties of rna folding .",
    "the most popular such model considers only the base - pair binding energy , instead of calculating the complicated stacking energy and loop cost .",
    "thus , for each bond between two bases @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the binding energy @xmath18 is calculated as @xmath19 and the total energy for a structure @xmath10 is just the sum of all binding energies , @xmath11 = \\sum_{(i , j ) \\in s } \\varepsilon_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the partition function can then be calculated by the recursive equation  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the partition function of the subsequence starting from the i@xmath22 and ending at the j@xmath22 nucleotide .",
    "the partition function of the whole sequence , @xmath23 , can thus be calculated by iterating this recursion in @xmath24 time .",
    "a second - order phase transition has been verified in this simplified model . at high enough temperature ,",
    "the rna molecule is in the so - called molten phase . in this phase ,",
    "sequence dependence of the base - pair binding energy becomes irrelevant .",
    "instead , the rna molecule behaves after some coarse graining like a homopolymer , with an identical binding energy @xmath25 for arbitrary pairs of nucleotides rendering its partition function analytically solvable  @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath15 is just a function of total sequence length , given as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29^{1/2}$ ] @xcite .",
    "as temperature decreases to the critical temperature , the phase transition occurs .",
    "the rna transitions into the glass phase and becomes of noticeably heteropolymer nature , with sequence - dependent binding energy for each base - pair binding .",
    "the generic properties of glass phase rna molecules are investigated by taking the quenched average of all random sequences , i.e. averaging over their free energies .",
    "these properties , including the occurrence of the phase transition itself , have been widely discussed numerically @xcite , and further verified by theoretical calculations on the basis of the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "a theoretical discussion is not necessary to be constraint to this simplest model .",
    "more complete but also complicated models can be constructed by adding the loop costs or even the stacking energy back into the model of the base - pair binding energy @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , more detailed properties can be discovered by including more free energy terms and structure constraints in the model .",
    "however , the calculations also dramatically become much more difficult . to obtain a general idea of the behavior of the linear correlation function , here , instead of using the most detailed models from the start ,",
    "we first restrict ourselves to the base - pair binding models , starting from the simplest one with only binding energy , and adding more free energy terms later if necessary . in the end",
    "we verify our findings using state of the art energy models including all the details necessary for quantitative rna structure prediction .",
    "in order to keep the language simpler , we will throughout the rest of this manuscript refer to the binding sites as protein binding sites , although they may represent microrna binding sites as well . for the purpose of modeling rna - protein binding events on rna secondary structures , we consider merely the simplest and inevitable aspect : a bound protein , with a size @xmath30 , would exclude all structures including any one of the @xmath30 base pairs in the footprint ( i.e. the bases bound by the protein ) .",
    "for all other bases we assume that they can form the same base pairs as without the protein binding  @xcite .",
    "even though , in practice , more sophisticated interactions , such as the excluded volume interaction between rna and protein , occur around the footprint , we do not include them in our minimal model , for the purpose of a coarse - grained and conceptual investigation .",
    "all thermodynamic quantities concerning the rna protein interactions can be derived from the partition function of the rna - protein system , @xmath31 in this expression @xmath32 is the partition function over all secondary structures of the rna without any protein binding ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the limited partition functions , in which all bases at the first or second protein binding site are unpaired , respectively ; @xmath35 is the partition function for which all bases at both of the two protein binding sites are unpaired . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the chemical potentials for the two proteins .",
    "practically , the protein chemical potentials are controlled by their concentrations in solution as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are characteristic parameters of the specific proteins , determined by experiments .",
    "the partition function can thus be rewritten as @xmath42 with @xmath43 the _ bare _ dissociation constant for a protein binding to an otherwise _ unstructured _ rna .    to quantify the interdependency between the protein binding sites , we introduce observables @xmath44 which are one if protein @xmath45 is bound and zero otherwise .",
    "if the the binding sites are independent , the thermodynamic average @xmath46 decouples into the product @xmath47 . thus , we use @xmath48 as a measure of interdependency of the binding sites . to discover generic characteristics of all nucleic acid sequences , we investigate the _ quenched average _ of this protein - protein correlation function over all random rna sequences , @xmath49 in practice ,",
    "we will choose random rna sequences in which each base is chosen with equal probability from the four possibilities a , u , g , and c , independently of the other bases .",
    "while structural rnas have very specific sequences that ensure their folding into a target structure , the random sequence model is appropriate for messenger rnas , the sequences of which are not optimized for a specific structure and which are anyways the more interesting targets for post - transcriptional regulation . the linear correlation function is then calculated as @xmath50 in the following , we will investigate this linear correlation function as a function of the distance , @xmath0 , between the two protein binding sites .",
    "as described in sec . [ sec : reviewrna2nd ] , our investigation of the linear correlation function for protein binding sites starts from the simplest model , which includes only the base - pair binding energy defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : binding - eng_diff ] ) .",
    "note that although we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : reviewrna2nd ] that there is a minimum size for hairpin loops in real rna , we do not impose such a constraint in this model for the purpose of a conceptual discussion .",
    "we first consider the high - temperature regime , where the rna is in the molten phase , with the partition function given in eq .",

    "since the simple energy model does not result in correlations between the binding sites , we are now going one step further than the simplest base - pair binding model and consider a loop cost .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : reviewrna2nd ] , the complete form of the loop cost includes a constant term for loop initialization and a length - dependent term for extension .",
    "since the constant term is generally much greater than the length - dependent term , it is appropriate to take loops into account only through this constant term .",

    "similarly , in @xmath55 ( the partition function into which two footprints of length @xmath30 are to be inserted ) , the limited partition functions for structures with at least one naked footprint are all at the order of @xmath185 and thus negligible , leading to a @xmath55 identical to the one for the model including constant loop cost multiplied by @xmath186 .",

    "since in practice the extension cost per free base in a loop , @xmath160 , is much less than the loop initialization cost @xmath67 , the critical temperature of the force - driven transition is typically high enough such that the force - driven phase transition occurs earlier than the glass - molten phase transition as temperature decreases .",
    "the properties of the glass phase ( limited ) partition functions are thus believed not to be affected by the stretched phase and thus to be similar to those of the model including only a constant loop cost .",

    "we apply the constraint folding capabilities of the vienna package to exclude the footprints ( i.e. , the bases bound by the protein ) from participating in base pairing , which allows us to calculate the limited partition functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for arbitrary rna sequences and distances between the protein binding sites .    based on our experience with the simplified models , we choose the protein concentrations and binding constants in the biologically reasonable regime ( iii ) where the binding sites are neither essentially empty nor completely saturated .",

    "we would like to point out that , even though our simplified model and the vienna package render very similar exponents for the power - law correlation , we do not give much credence to the precise value of this value , since it is dependend on strong finite - size effects .",
    "e.g. , it appears that the effective exponent depends somewhat on protein concentrations and its absolute value decreases ( i.e. the power law decays slower ) as the ratios @xmath130 increase .",
    "the reason for such tendency is still unclear and requires more investigation in the future .",
    "however , independent of the precise value of the exponent , the important fact is that the protein - protein correlation function does not decay exponentially but rather has a fat ( power - law ) tail which enables interdependency between proteins binding at long distances from each other along the molecule .     on rna polymers of 200 nucleotides .",

    "distance is expressed by the number of base pairs ( bp ) between the two binding sites .",

    "in summary , we have proposed a mechanism for long - range interactions between multiple binding partners of an rna molecule . according to our model , the ensemble of rna secondary structures can be viewed as a medium for this long range interaction .",
    "when one protein or microrna binds to the rna , it also changes the ensemble , and the change of the ensemble transmits the effect of this binding partner to the other binding partner , thus resulting in an interplay between them . following this concept ,",
    "we have quantified this interplay at least for the simplest two - partner case .",

    "we discussed this discovery in detail using analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "for the rna in the high - temperature molten phase , we analytically derived a power - law correlation function , and verified this result numerically . in the low - temperature glass phase",
    ", we numerically calculated the linear correlation function and discovered that this long - range phenomenon is strongly affected by protein concentrations , but occurs precisely at those biologically meaningful protein concentrations at which the rna is neither fully saturated with proteins nor completely unoccupied . in biology",
    ", this interdependency between protein binding sites thus can play an important role in combinatorial gene regulation on the post - transcriptional level .",
    "it is therefore worth to theoretically and experimentally investigate the phenomenon discovered here on the level of generic sequences for specific naturally occurring rna molecules and their protein binding partners .",
    "the conclusions of the coarse - grained models are verified by the vienna package , which is viewed as the state of the art for the numerical simulation of real rna molecules .",
    "some of the advanced discussion about the loop penalty , leading to the issue of its length dependence , has been performed , and a similar power - law linear correlation function was shown .",
    "we thus believe that the constant loop initiation penalty , the one we focused on in the very first discussion , is the critical factor for the occurrence of the long - range effect .    in our discussions we assumed that the proteins do not directly interact with each other in order to focus on the role of the rna secondary structure alone . based on our calculations ,",
    "the structure mediated indeterdependcy between binding sites is due to configurations in which the protein binding sites are located on opposite sides of the same stem of the molecule .",
    "thus , in these configurations the proteins are in fact in close spatial proximity and direct interactions between the proteins would further enhance the interdependency observed here .    in consequence ,",

    "still many issues , such as the exact glass - phase exponent of the power law , the effect of additional details in rna folding models , and establishing that this rna structure mediated interdependency between binding sites is in fact used in post - transcriptional regulation of real mrnas , are unsolved and left for future investigations .",
