    "magnetism of bilayers and multilayers is a rapidly developing research field mainly due to the fact that they show novel magnetic properties different from those of bulk materials as well as due to advances in their characterization and preparation at atomic scale  @xcite .",
    "this can lead to useful technological applications such as high density magnetic recording and magnetic sensors  @xcite .",
    "one of the main theoretical interests lies in the possibility to study the cross - over phenomena between the two- and three - dimensional systems  @xcite .    a number of studies focused on magnetic properties of simple ising bilayers formed by two ferromagnetic layers coupled by an exchange interaction of varying strength  @xcite .",
    "such bilayers have been shown to undergo phase transitions that belong to the same universality class as a two - dimensional ising model and their critical temperature is controlled by the so - called shift exponent that depends on the interlayer to intralayer coupling ratio . if the underlying lattice is bipartite and there are no competing further - neighbor interactions the sign of the respective exchange interactions is irrelevant in the absence of an external magnetic field .    however , the sign of the interactions matters in the case of a bilayer on a nonbipartite , such as triangular , lattice . it is well known",
    "that , in contrast to its ferromagnetic counterpart , a two - dimensional triangular lattice ising antiferromagnet ( tlia ) shows no long - range order ( lro ) phase down to zero temperature due to high geometrical frustration  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a three - dimensional system obtained by stacking of individual tlia planes on top of each other has been confirmed to display lro also at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "recently , interesting cross - over phenomena have been observed in a layered system obtained by gradual stacking of a finite number of tlia planes , that lead to a new scenario for fluctuation - induced ordering in frustrated spin systems  @xcite .",
    "the above findings motivated the present study , in which we consider an ising bilayer system consisting of one antiferromagnetic ( af ) and one ferromagnetic ( fm ) triangular planes , coupled by the fm interlayer exchange interaction . as discussed above , the critical behavior of the individual planes is very different . while the fm one displays a single standard ising universality class phase transition to the fm lro phase , the af one shows no lro down to zero temperature due to high geometrical frustration .",
    "the study of such a bilayer system with all the exchange interactions having uniform magnitudes pointed to the existence of two lro phases in the af plane , induced by an effective field coming from the fm plane  @xcite . in the present study",
    "we demonstrate that the competing ordering and disordering tendencies enforced by the respective planes in the af / fm bilayer result in a rather intricate critical behavior in the exchange interaction parameter space .",
    "the model hamiltonian of the studied bilayer system takes the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an ising spin on the @xmath5th lattice site , the first two sums run over nearest neighbors ( nn ) within a and b planes , coupled by the antiferromagnetic @xmath6 and ferromagnetic @xmath7 exchange interactions , respectively , and the third sum runs over nn between the planes a and b , coupled by the ferromagnetic interaction @xmath8 .",
    "the model is studied by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations following the metropolis dynamics .",
    "we consider spin systems of the sizes @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and periodic ( open ) boundary conditions within ( out of ) the planes .",
    "temperature dependencies of various thermodynamic quantities are obtained using standard mc simulation in which for thermal averaging we typically consider @xmath12 monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) after discarding another @xmath13 mcs necessary for thermalization ( burn - in period ) . in order to shorten the thermalization period and keep the system close to the equilibrium in the entire temperature range we apply the following procedure .",
    "we start from high temperatures ( paramagnetic region ) with random initialization and gradually decrease them with a small step ( typically @xmath14 or @xmath15 , measured in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath16 ) .",
    "the simulation at the next temperature starts from the final configuration obtained at the previous temperature .    in order to obtain the critical exponents",
    ", we perform a finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis , in which case we apply the reweighting techniques  @xcite .",
    "then we use @xmath17 and @xmath18 mcs , and to reduce autocorrelation in the time series the fss analysis is performed on the thinned data using only every 10-th sample .",
    "we note that the autocorrelation is particularly enhanced at the low - temperature phase transition in the frustrated af layer and thus relatively long simulation times are necessary to obtain a reliable output .",
    "we made sure that the number of mcs used in the fss analysis is sufficient by assessing the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath19 , corresponding to the order parameter @xmath20 of the af plane ( see the definition below ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauint_op1_j04 ] , for the largest lattice sizes it is of the order of @xmath21 mcs and it follows the scaling law @xmath22 with the estimated dynamic critical exponent @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , approaching frustrated spin systems by conventional mc simulations in many instances turned out problematic due to extremely slow relaxation resulting from suppressed tunneling through barriers in multimodal energy landscapes .",
    "this problem can be eliminated by applying the parallel tempering ( pt ) or replica exchange method  @xcite , which overcomes energy barriers by a random walk in temperature space and allows exploration of complex energy landscapes .",
    "therefore , when in doubt , we try to verify the reliability of the obtained results by supplementing them with those from pt . in the latter , we use @xmath24 mcs and replica swaps at neighboring temperatures are proposed after each sweep . for reliable estimation of statistical errors ,",
    "we use the @xmath25-method  @xcite .     at the low - temperature phase transition in the af layer , for different lattice sizes @xmath26 .",

    "are known to scale with a lattice size as , for example : @xmath54 or @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 from the above finite - size scaling ( fss ) relations one can estimate the respective critical exponents @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and thus determine the corresponding universality class .    naturally , the above fss relations are not applicable in the case of the tlia model , as it shows no lro down to zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that in the ground state it displays quasi - long - range ordering ( qlro ) with the spin - correlation function decaying as a power law  @xcite : @xmath63 where the critical exponent of the correlation function takes the value of @xmath64 .",
    "the power - law decay of the spin - correlation function is also characteristic for the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase  @xcite in the six - state clock model with @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath66 can be estimated by fss of the corresponding order parameter @xmath67 , which scales as @xmath68    owing to perturbations in the form of an effective field and further - neighbor coupling coming from the fm layer , the af layer may show at low temperatures also the true ferrimagnetic lro , similar to the tlia model in an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the ferrimagnetic lro and qlro phases can be distinguished by the quantity @xmath49 , which tends to the value @xmath69 in the former and @xmath70 in the latter case  @xcite .",
    "in the following we present the results for the case of the intraplane exchange interactions having equal strengths and the intraplane to interplane exchange interaction ratio varying from zero to infinity , i.e. , @xmath71 , for @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the ground state ( gs ) can be determined by considering the energetics of two coupled elementary triangular plaquettes in the adjacent planes .",
    "it is found that for @xmath73 gs is magnetically disordered `` dimer '' phase , while within @xmath74 both planes display long - range ordering ( lro ) .",
    "namely , the fm plane shows ferromagnetic ( fm ) lro and the af plane ferrimagnetic ( fr2 ) lro with spins on two sublattices parallel and on one sublattice antiparallel to the arrangement of the spins in the fm plane .",
    "the above gs scenario is corroborated by temperature variations of the magnetizations in the respective planes @xmath75 and @xmath76 , obtained for various @xmath77 and fixed @xmath78 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ma - t ] and  [ fig : mb - t ] . for @xmath79",
    ", both @xmath75 and @xmath76 remain zero at any temperature , whereas for @xmath80 , they saturate to the zero - temperature values of 1/3 and 1 , respectively . at higher temperatures",
    "there is a phase transition in the fm plane from the paramagnetic ( p ) to the fm phase at some critical value @xmath81 .",
    "one can notice that the lro in the fm plane triggers some degree of fm ordering also in the af plane , which is reflected in a finite value of @xmath75 and to which we will refer as a ferrimagnetic fr1 phase . naturally , the degree of fm ordering in the fr1 phase increases with decreasing @xmath77 ( i.e. , increasing the interplane coupling @xmath2 ) and for sufficiently low @xmath77 , such as @xmath82 , the net magnetic moment in the af plane can exceed that of the fr2 phase , appearing below the second transition temperature @xmath83 .",
    "the two phase transitions are also evident from the two sharp peaks in the specific heat curves for @xmath74 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - t_log ] on a semi - log scale .",
    "however , for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , one can notice another round peak wedged in between the two sharp ones , the origin of which will be discussed below .",
    "as we are dealing with the system consisting of a fully frustrated af subsystem with macroscopically degenerate gs and non - vanishing residual entropy , and a non - frustrated fm subsystem with a unique gs , it is also interesting to study how the system entropy changes with a varying parameter @xmath77 .",
    "inverse temperature dependencies of the latter , obtained by the thermodynamic integration method , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent - beta ] . for @xmath86",
    ", the entropy density resembles that of the decoupled dimers and approaches the exact residual value of @xmath87 as @xmath88 goes to zero . for @xmath74 ,",
    "as the temperature decreases instead of leveling off one can observe two successive drops at @xmath81 and @xmath89 and eventually vanishing at sufficiently low @xmath88 .",
    "nevertheless , for some range of @xmath90 , the entropy decrease is very gentle ( see the case of @xmath91 ) and its complete vanishing can be expected only at extremely low temperatures .",
    "this behavior is related to the appearance of the round peaks in the specific heat curves above , which signal the onset of the qlro phase in the af plane ( see below ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath92 the residual entropy acquires again a finite value of @xmath93 , corresponding to the mean value of the decoupled planes , i.e. , @xmath70 in fm and @xmath94 in af  @xcite planes .",
    "let us now study the origin of the peculiar behavior of the specific heat and the entropy for @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , this behavior can be ascribed to fluctuations occurring solely in the af plane , as nothing extraordinary can be observed in the fm plane .",
    "therefore , let us focus on the corresponding order parameter @xmath20 introduced above . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_n_c6-t_j09 ] we plot its temperature dependencies for @xmath91 and various lattice sizes ( empty symbols ) .",
    "apparently , before reaching the saturation value in the low - temperature ferrimagnetic fr2 phase , for some range of intermediate temperatures , @xmath20 takes finite values but slowly vanishes with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "such a behavior is typical for a qlro , such as the bkt phase  @xcite .",
    "indeed , by plotting the parameter @xmath49 in the same figure ( filled symbols ) one can see that it acquires values close to @xmath95 for @xmath96 but vanishes at higher temperatures .",
    "assuming the algebraically decaying correlation function in the qlro phase ( eq .  [ pl ] ) , the corresponding exponent @xmath97 can be estimated from the fss expression  ( [ ms_fss ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - t_j09 ] , the qlro phase with @xmath98 is sandwiched between the low - temperature fr2 lro phase with @xmath99 and the high - temperature disordered p phase with @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the two low - temperature specific heat anomalies observed for @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - t_log ] above manifest transitions between the respective phases .",
    "the value of @xmath101 in the intermediate temperature phase points to the highly degenerate wannier state , as the one observed in the ground state of the tlia model  @xcite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the development of an effective interaction lifts up the wannier state and we can witness the crossover to the bkt phase with @xmath102 before entering to the fr2 lro phase .",
    "the respective identified phases are summarized in the phase diagram , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .",
    "the empty symbols represent approximate values obtained from the specific heat maxima at fixed @xmath78 , the crosses show more precise values obtained from the fss analysis ( see below ) and the filled downward triangles represent the exact values at @xmath103 .     parameter space .",
    "pairs of acronyms in the brackets denote the respective phases in the planes a and b , where p , fm , fr1 , fr2 and qlro denote the paramagnetic , ferromagnetic , two different ferrimagnetic and quasi - long - range - order phases , respectively . the empty symbols represent approximate ( pseudo - transition ) values , the crosses more precise values obtained from the fss analysis and the filled downward triangles show the exact ground - state values . ]    the nature of the respective phase transitions can be studied by performing the fss analysis . the high - temperature p - fm phase transition in the fm layer",
    "is identified as a second - order transition belonging to the standard ising universality class .",
    "no significant deviation from the standard behavior is found even in the strong interplane coupling limit , as shown in fig .",

    "the corresponding critical temperature is obtained from the fss in fig .",
    "[ fig : fss_tc2_m2_j02 ] , as @xmath104 .",
    "thus , it appears that the coupling of the fm layer to the frustrated af layer results in lowering of the transition temperature but otherwise does not alter its critical properties , as long as the phase transition takes place , i.e. , for @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "the universality class of the low - temperature fr1-fr2 phase transition occurring in the af layer is clearly different from the ising one . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fss_t1_mn_j04 ] we present the fss results for the respective critical exponents for @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , the estimated values of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are rather close to the universal values of the three - state ferromagnetic potts model  @xcite , with the exact critical exponent ratios : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 . the critical temperature is estimated as @xmath114 . similar values of the critical exponent ratios as for @xmath105 are also obtained for other values of the parameter @xmath77 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : indices ] .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath77 approaches larger values in the vicinity of the qlro phase the exponents start showing systematic deviation from the potts values .",
    "such deviation can be expected since with increasing @xmath77 we approach the point at which the critical line of the potts values splits into two bkt transition lines .",
    "more specifically , the high - temperature critical line corresponds to the rotational symmetry breaking line with @xmath115 , and the low - temperature one corresponds to the discretized rotational symmetry breaking line with @xmath116 .",

    "we studied the critical behavior of an ising bilayer system consisting of two ferromagnetically coupled triangular planes with the af and fm intraplane interactions .",
    "although the critical properties of the individual planes are well known , we showed that the interplay of the ordering tendencies enforced by the fm plane and disordering ones in the geometrically frustrated af plane through the interplane coupling can lead to novel phenomena , not observed in the separate planes .",
    "particularly interesting is the critical behavior of the af layer .",
    "its coupling to the adjacent fm plane can be viewed as an effective coupling to the next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) . at the same time",

    "so is the shrinking of the qlro phase and changing to a single critical point , belonging to the three - state potts universality , with the increasing @xmath152 in the present model with the situation when the external field is gradually increased in the nnn tlia model .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are some differences between the two models .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing one is the character of the qlro phase . while the nnn tlia model in the field shows the xy - like bkt type of correlations , characterized by @xmath65 , the present model displays a clear cross - over to the wannier state with @xmath64 .",

    "[ fig : nu_m1m2mo - t_j1 - 4 ] or  [ fig : nu_mo - t_jz0_6 ] .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of equal nn and nnn couplings , we found no signs of first - order phase transitions within the range of our calculations . in the isotropic case ,",
    "a good candidate area for such transitions is the part of the low - temperature phase boundary just above the critical value of @xmath153 .",
    "nevertheless , the fss results pointed to the second - order phase transitions in the three - state potts universality class down to at least @xmath82 ( see fig.[fig : indices ] ) . even though the possibility of the existence of the first - order phase transitions within @xmath154 can not be ruled out , it is also possible that the effective nnn coupling in this area is still insufficient to induce them .    in the limiting cases when either the fm or af intraplane coupling significantly prevails over the other and",
    "the planes are strongly coupled together , the critical behavior of the entire bilayer is governed by the plane with the dominant coupling . since at low temperatures the nn spins in the adjacent layers are virtually locked together , the spin dynamics becomes slowed down and practically frozen well above the ground state .",
    "this happens in both cases but it is particularly conspicuous in the case when the plane with the dominant coupling is the highly degenerated af one .    in the present study we considered the af / fm bilayer , in which the respective layers consisted of single af and fm planes .",
    "further appealing extension could involve the layers formed by stacks of a finite number of the af and fm planes .",
    "it would be interesting to see how the ordering effects from the fm layer propagate through the af stack , the nature of the critical behavior of which itself is additionally controlled by its thickness  @xcite .",

    "<S> critical properties of an ising bilayer system , consisting of two triangular planes with antiferromagnetic ( af ) @xmath0 and ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath1 exchange interactions , coupled by the interlayer exchange @xmath2 , are studied by monte carlo simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the fm plane is found to induce in the af one some effects similar to those resulting from the joint presence of a next - nearest - neighbor fm coupling and an external magnetic field in the single triangular lattice ising antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the similarities include the appearance of the quasi - long - range - order bkt phase with algebraically decaying correlations for smaller @xmath2 , as well as the phase transitions belonging to the three - state potts universality class for larger @xmath2 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> no first - order phase transitions are observed . </S>",
    "<S> a new phenomenon is a cross - over from the bkt to the wannier state at higher temperatures , that can be stabilized over a relatively wide temperature range . in the strong @xmath2 limit </S>",
    "<S> , the critical behavior of the entire bilayer is governed by the behavior of the plane with a dominant intraplane interaction . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 is dominant , then the strong @xmath2 coupling makes the system kinetically freeze at lower temperatures . </S>"
