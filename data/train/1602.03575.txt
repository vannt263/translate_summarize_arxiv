    "in the study of totally disconnected locally compact ( t.d.l.c . ) hausdorff groups , groups of automorphisms of locally finite trees appear naturally and form a significant class of examples .",

    "this theorem extracts abstractly simple subgroups from groups acting on the tree in a sufficiently dense and independent way .",
    "we then present two constructions of closed subgroups of tree automorphisms with prescribed local actions and examine some of the local - global phenomena that they exhibit .",
    "first , we present in section [ sec : universal ] the universal group construction by m. burger and s. mozes ( see @xcite ) , which to every permutation group @xmath1 associates a subgroup @xmath2 which locally acts like @xmath3 ( here , @xmath4 denotes the @xmath5-regular tree ) .",
    "properties of the groups @xmath6 are often determined by those of the finite group @xmath3 .",
    "universal groups are fundamental in the study of lattices in the product of the automorphism groups of two trees , analogous to the study of lattices in semisimple lie groups , and are key to the proof of the normal subgroup theorem ( see @xcite and l.  bartholdi s chapter ) .",
    "second , we describe in section [ sec : k - closure ] a variation of this construction by c. banks , m. elder and g. willis ( see @xcite ) : given @xmath7 for an arbitrary tree @xmath8 it produces a sequence of closed subgroups @xmath9 which act like @xmath10 on balls of radius @xmath0 .",
    "this sequence converges to the topological closure @xmath11 of @xmath10 from above , in a sense to be made precise .",
    "we will use tits simplicity theorem to construct infinitely many , pairwise distinct , non - discrete , compactly generated , abstractly simple , t.d.l.c .  groups . finding simple t.d.l.c .",
    "groups ( and in particular , compactly generated ones ) has become relevant to the structure theory of t.d.l.c .",
    "groups thanks to results of caprace ",
    "monod @xcite , which state that such groups can be decomposed into simple pieces .",
    "let @xmath8 be a simplicial tree with vertex set @xmath12 and edge set @xmath13 .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath12 is countable and that @xmath8 is not isomorphic to a bi - infinite line .",
    "each edge @xmath14 is determined by its origin @xmath15 and its terminus @xmath16 , so the edge @xmath17 is the _ inverse _ of @xmath18 .",
    "the pair @xmath19 is a _",
    "geometric edge_. given any edge @xmath20 , the subgraph @xmath21 has two connected components @xmath22 which we call _ half - trees_. we think of @xmath23 as a subtree rooted at @xmath24 .    a _ path _",
    "is given by a sequence of adjacent vertices , and it is a _ reduced path _ ( or _ geodesic _ ) if there is no backtracking in the sequence . setting adjacent vertices to have distance 1 between them yields the standard metric on @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "given a vertex @xmath25 , we set @xmath26 to be the set of edges starting at @xmath24 and write @xmath27 for the ball of radius",
    "@xmath28 centred at @xmath24 as well as @xmath29 for the sphere of radius @xmath28 around @xmath24 .",
    "an isometric embedding of @xmath30 into @xmath8 is called a _ ray_. we will say that two rays @xmath31 are equivalent , denoting it by @xmath32 , if there exists some @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",
    "we call the collection of equivalence classes of such rays the _ boundary _ of the tree and denote it by @xmath35 the rays @xmath36 are _ at bounded distance from each other _ if the function @xmath37 is bounded .",
    "this _ a priori _ weaker equivalence relation is actually the same as the previous one : it is impossible for two rays to be at bounded distance from each other without actually coinciding eventually .",
    "we introduce a topology on @xmath38 ( resp . on @xmath39 ) by taking @xmath40 ( resp . @xmath41 as a basis of open sets .",
    "it is easy to see that this makes @xmath8 into an discrete , open and dense subset of @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath8 is locally finite then both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are compact with this topology .",
    "let @xmath42 be the automorphism group of @xmath8 .",

    "@xmath45 of @xmath44 consists of elements @xmath46 such that @xmath47 , while the _ fixator _ @xmath48 of @xmath44 consists of @xmath46 such that @xmath49 for every vertex @xmath50 of @xmath44 .",
    "we say that @xmath10 acts _ edge - transitively _ ( respectively , _",
    "vertex - transitively _ ) if @xmath10 acts transitively on geometric edges ( respectively , vertices ) .",
    "the topology of pointwise convergence on vertices gives @xmath42 the structure of a polish ( i.e. metrizable , separable and complete ) topological group .",
    "the basic open sets for this topology are of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a finite subset of @xmath12 . in particular , @xmath54 is open for any finite @xmath53 .",
    "we will sometimes assume that the tree is locally finite ( i.e.  every vertex has only finitely many neighbors ) .",
    "in this case the balls @xmath55 around any vertex @xmath24 are finite . since these balls are preserved by the stabilizer @xmath56 , this open subgroup is the inverse limit of its restriction to balls of finite radius and is therefore compact .",
    "thus when @xmath8 is locally finite @xmath42 is a t.d.l.c .",
    "group .",
    "we will say that two directed edges are _ co - oriented _ if their orientations agree along the unique geodesic connecting them ( see figure [ fig : co_oriented ] ) . for an automorphism @xmath57 , define @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the minimum above is taken over all points @xmath24 in the geometric realization of the tree .",
    "thus , for example , if @xmath60 inverts an edge @xmath18 then the set @xmath61 will be the midpoint of the corresponding geometric edge . due to the simplicial nature of the action",

    "let @xmath57 and assume that there exists an edge @xmath18 that is co - oriented with its image @xmath64 .",
    "since being co - oriented is an equivalence relation on directed edges , it follows that @xmath65 are all co - oriented along a bi - infinite geodesic @xmath66 and @xmath60 restricts to a translation of length @xmath67 along this axis .",
    "once we have such an invariant axis , then for every vertex @xmath68 we have @xmath69 ( see figure [ fig : co_oriented ] ) .",
    "in particular , as our notation already suggests , @xmath70 .    thus , whenever there exists an edge that is co - oriented with its image , @xmath60 is hyperbolic .",
    "conversely , if @xmath62 , let @xmath71 , and let @xmath72 be the geodesic connecting @xmath24 to @xmath73 . the directed edge @xmath74 must be co - oriented with its image since otherwise we would have @xmath75 , contradicting our choice of @xmath24 .",
    "a similar picture shows that the general formula @xmath76 holds also for elliptic elements and inversions .",
    "when @xmath77 we denote by @xmath78 the two points of @xmath38 corresponding to the two extremes of the axis @xmath61 .",
    "the point @xmath79 , represented by the ray in the direction of translation , is called _ the attracting point of _ and @xmath80 is called its _ repelling point_. note that if @xmath81 are open neighborhoods , then for every large enough @xmath82 we have @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath84 and @xmath60 share the same axis , but translate in different directions , we have @xmath85 .",
    "if we replace the tree by its barycentric subdivision ( adding one vertex in the middle of every geometric edge ) , we retain the same automorphism group , but every inversion becomes an elliptic element on the new tree . using this trick",
