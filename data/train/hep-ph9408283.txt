    "recently the cleo collaboration has observed the charmless decays of @xmath0 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12@xcite .",
    "the upper limits on the branching fractions are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the sum of @xmath16 and @xmath17 exceeds zero with a significance more than four standard deviations .",
    "one can expect , individuals of these exclusive channels and also the inclusive processes will be found at cesr or future b factories .",
    "the b meson system is expected to give rise to a very rich phenomenology , providing a wealth of information that will allow us to constrain the currently very successful standard model ( sm ) , as well as many extensions that go beyond it .",
    "it also provides many channels for the search of cp violation .",
    "the charmless @xmath18 quark decay has already been calculated in several papers@xcite .",
    "they are induced by both @xmath19 transition and penguin diagrams .",
    "the @xmath19 transition diagrams are easy to calculate , but penguin diagrams are more complicated . w.s .",
    "hou showed the results of penguin diagrams without qcd corrections in ref.@xcite .",
    "afterwards , results including some short distance qcd corrections were given by r. grigjanis et al.@xcite .",
    "for different processes , the authors claimed that the branching ratios are either qcd - enhanced or suppressed by a notable factor . in other words ,",
    "the strong interaction plays an important role in these decays .",
    "but this is not the end of the story , there are still some unsolved questions . the anomalous dimensions used in ref.@xcite",
    "were changed later by the authors themselves in ref.@xcite s erratum .",
    "this change caused large effects in process @xmath20 which can be seen in the present paper .",
    "see also a recent work by ciuchini et al.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , only two four - quark operators were considered there , while the other four were neglected .",
    "unfortunately , the missing four operators are responsible for contributing to the matrix elements of processes @xmath1 ( q = uds ) and @xmath21 . although their coefficients of matching at @xmath22 can be transferred to the operator @xmath23 of ref.@xcite",
    "is not the one that we defined in this paper ] , when running , these six four - quark operators will be mixed together , so the missing four will reappear with nonzero coefficients .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath24 case .",
    "since charmless decays of @xmath0 meson caused a great interest in studying cp violation , and the present experimental limit falls in with the theoretical predictions of the standard model , a more accurate calculation is needed to reduce theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present an improved leading log qcd corrected result .",
    "the basic effective field theory idea is by now quite well established@xcite . in our particular case of minimal standard model ,",
    "we integrate out the top quark and the weak w bosons at @xmath25 scale , generating an effective five - quark theory . by using the renormalization group equation",
    ", we run the effective field theory down to b - quark scale to calculate qcd corrections to charmless @xmath18 decay .    after applying the full qcd equations of motion@xcite , a complete set of operators relevant for charmless @xmath0 decays can be chosen to be : @xmath26 @xmath27",
    "the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath28 with @xmath29 denoting the qcd coupling constant .",
    "then we can write down our effective hamiltonian as @xmath30 one can find the coefficients of operators at @xmath25 scale by integrating out the weak gauge bosons and would - be goldstone bosons at this scale . since in standard model , there is no tree level flavor changing neutral current , all charmless @xmath31 processes are through loop diagrams . they are qcd induced processes . even if no radiative qcd corrections are performed , they are already order of o(@xmath32)@xcite",
    ". the decay amplitudes of four - quark processes are proportional to @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the leading logarithmic qcd corrections to them are of o(@xmath34^n$ ] ) with @xmath35 .",
    "they are summed by the one - loop renormalization group equation in the leading log approximation .",
    "so this approximation will include the leading log terms of all loops but miss the @xmath36 terms of one - loop diagrams .",
    "although this is usually considered as part of the next - to - leading log effect , it is actually part of the one - loop result .",
    "we will use the complete one - loop result ( including @xmath37 ) for four - quark operators in matching at @xmath22 , so that we can get a result from both the complete one - loop contribution and summation of leading log contribution .",
    "this is an improvement in the perturbative calculation at least for the qcd - induced four - quark processes .",
    "the matching diagrams for four - quark operators are displayed in fig.[fmat3 ] ( there should also be three additional symmetric four quark diagrams at each side of the first equation in fig.1 . ) . matching diagrams for operator @xmath23",
    "are very similar to @xmath38 calculations@xcite . neglecting small terms proportional to @xmath39 or @xmath40 in these matching conditions , and using @xmath41 , one finds the following coefficients of the operators:@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
