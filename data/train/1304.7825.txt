    "the kaluza - klein theories , as well as other extra dimension theories , has been boosted after the seminal papers of randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite . by assuming an specific geometry , namely , a warped product between a flat 3-brane and a single extra dimension , the rs models solved the hierarchy problem , providing a tiny correction to the newtonian potential and allowing gravity propagation in an extra dimension .    indeed , rs models opened new trends to theoretical research .",
    "soon after , a huge amount of papers appeared enhancing features of rs models as proving the stability of the geometrical solution @xcite , providing a physical source for this geometry @xcite , allowing the other fields to propagate in the bulk @xcite or extending the model to higher dimensions @xcite .    in six dimensions ,",
    "some models assume two extra dimensions ( an extension of the so called rs type 1 model ) where some two dimensional compact transverse manifold has been proposed @xcite , including some peculiar manifolds as the torus @xcite , an apple shape space @xcite and a football shaped manifold @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some authors have studied a braneworld where the two dimensional manifold has a cylindrical symmetry according to the 3-brane , the so - called string - like brane @xcite .",
    "this brane can be regarded as a @xmath3-dimensional vortex embedded in a @xmath4-dimensional space - time @xcite .    among the good achievements of the last models",
    "are the localization of the fermion @xcite and gauge @xcite fields on the brane coupled only with gravity and a lower correction to the gravitational potential @xcite . besides , the geometry is richer than the @xmath5d rs type 2 model , since the exterior space - time of the string - brane is conical with deficit angle proportional to the string tensions @xcite .",
    "hence , the exterior geometry of the string - brane reflects the physical content of the brane .",
    "this relationship between geometry and physics led us to study how the physical characteristics of a braneworld change when the geometry of the transverse manifold evolves under a geometrical flow .",
    "this flux can be realized as a symmetry change ( perhaps a break ) of the geometry due to variations of the parameters that describe the brane .    in order to accomplish this task",
    "we have chosen as a transverse manifold a 2-cycle of a well - known space in string theory , the so - called resolved conifold .",
    "this is a smooth parameter - dependent six dimensional space whose parameter @xmath6 controls the singularity on the tip of the cone @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible continuously flow from a smooth to a singular manifold by means of variations of the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the resolved conifold is one of the smoothed manifolds from the conifold , a calabi - yau ( cy ) orbifold that plays an important role in the conical transitions in string theory @xcite .",
    "there is another smoothed conifold , obtained by deforming through a parameter the quadric that defines the conifold , called deformed conifold @xcite .",
    "both spaces are quite important in some extensions of the ads - cft correspondence , where the branes are placed at the nobe of the smoothed cones @xcite .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the gravitational field on a bulk builded from a warped product between a flat @xmath1-brane and a deformed or resolved conifold has already been studied . for the former case , the authors studied the gravity in the whole deformed conifold or in a compact domain nearby a region of the deformed conifold called klebanov - strassler throat @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the massless mode , usually identified with the effective gravity , is normalizable and the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes are peaked in the throat . for the resolved conifold , despite there is an infinite radial dimension , the massless mode is located around the origin and the kk spectrum has an exponential decay @xcite .",
    "the study of the behavior of the fields on braneworlds with non trivial transverse manifolds has already been addressed in the literature .",
    "indeed , for a manifold like a tear drop , the conical singularity plays an important role in adjusting the brane cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "further , ricci - flat or homogeneous spaces locate not only gravity but also chiral fermions @xcite .",
    "another singular solution is the so - called cigar - like universe where the transverse space has a cylindrical shape far from the brane but the radius of the cylinder shrinks as we move toward the brane @xcite .    in this article",
    "we are concerned with an axisymmetric and static six dimensional braneworld with cosmological constant whose transverse space is a @xmath0-cycle of the resolved conifold . we have investigated its geometrical issues , as well the behavior of the vector gauge field in this background . in our last article @xcite , we have shown that a real scalar field exhibits some interesting results in this geometry , as a parametrization of the well - known volcano potential for the kk modes and a robust localization of the massless mode upon the resolution flow . here , through a new warp function that possess a @xmath7 symmetry ,",
    "we have analyzed the components of stress - energy - momentum tensor , the string tensions and the relation between the mass scales .",
    "although near the origin the scalar curvature depends strongly upon the resolution parameter , the bulk converges to a @xmath8 manifold , regardless the value of the resolution parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we argue that this is a realistic scenario since the components of the energy - momentum tensor satisfy the weak energy condition and the failure of the dominant energy condition is shared with other six dimensional models , as the gherghetta - schaposhnikov ( gs ) model @xcite , where the @xmath1-brane is infinitely thin @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the energy string tension ( string mass ) is always greater than the other string tension , as in gs model @xcite . besides , when the value of the resolution parameter increases the relationship between the mass scales increases also .    for @xmath9 , this geometry can be realized as a complete ( interior and exterior ) string - like solutions that provides some corrections to the thin string model near the origin .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath10 , the 3-brane can be regarded as a brane embedded in a 4-brane with a compact extra dimension whose radius is the resolution parameter .",
    "this enable us to realize the rs type 1 model as a limit of the six dimensional non - compact scenario .",
    "in addition , we have studied how the gauge field behaves under the resolution flow .",
    "due to the non - trivial geometry , we assumed that the brane component of the gauge field does not depend on the radial coordinate .",
    "this condition yields a homogeneous differential equation for the kk modes which is valid only for the @xmath2wave solution , i.e. , for @xmath11 . for this solution ,",
    "the massless mode exhibits a @xmath7 symmetry and it is trapped to the brane for any value of @xmath10 . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the massless mode vanishes on the brane due to the conical behavior .",
    "therefore , the resolution parameter also allows to define the gauge zero - mode on the brane , despite the conical characteristic .",
    "the problem of find the induced field equation on the brane also occurs with the gravitational field in string - like modes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the kk modes are well - behaved near the brane and they converge asymptotically to the well - known string - like spectrum @xcite . besides , @xmath6 prevents an infinite well on the brane , which happens for conical spaces ( @xmath9 ) , and controls the high of the barrier and the depth of the well around the brane .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ conifold ]",
    "we have review the most important features of the resolved conifold .",
    "furthermore , we have proposed and studied the properties of the @xmath0-cycle of the resolved conifold that we have chosen as the transverse manifold . in section [ bulk geometry ]",
    "we built the warped product between a @xmath1-brane and the @xmath0-cycle described before .",
    "we presented and discussed the properties of the warp function chosen and the angular metric component . from the einstein equation",
    ", we have studied the properties of the energy - momentum tensor components and the respective string tensions .",
    "further , we analyzed the behavior of the relation between the mass scales with the resolution parameter . in section [ gauge vector field localization ] we have obtained the massless mode as well as the kk spectrum for the @xmath2wave solution . in this section",
    "we have studied also the response of the gauge field to the resolution flow .",
    "some conclusions and perspectives are outlined in section [ conclusions and perspectives ] .",
    "in this section we present the definitions and main properties of the conifold as well of its smooth version , the so - called resolved manifold .",
    "further , we choose and study some characteristics of a 2-cycle of the resolved conifold that we shall use as a transverse manifold .    the 6-conifold is a conical manifold @xmath12 defined as the solution of the quadric equation @xcite @xmath13    a key property of this equation , inherent to the conics , is that , if @xmath14 satisfy eq .",
    "@xmath15 then @xmath16 , @xmath17 , also satify eq . @xmath15 .",
    "the point @xmath18 is the so - called node or tip of conifold whereas for a fixed @xmath19 we obtain a manifold called the base space @xmath20 .    by construction , it is possible to define a radial coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "using such variable , a rather general metric of a 6-conifold over a @xmath22 compact space takes the form @xmath23    for a well - known coset base space @xmath24 , we can employ the coordinate system where @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] leading the metric of eq .",
    "( [ conicalmetric ] ) to @xcite @xmath28 this space has a naked singularity in @xmath29",

    "that in the limit @xmath35 the metric ( [ metricresolvedconifold ] ) converges to a spherical one of radius @xmath6 @xmath36 that has no singularity .",
    "topologically this can be seen as a result of to take out a small neighborhood around @xmath29 and replaced it by a @xmath37 of radius @xmath6 .",
    "since the metric for the coordinates @xmath38 vanishes near the origin , where the singularity is , let us concern ourselves with 2-cycle cone that remains finite in the origin , namely @xmath39    this cone has a radial metric component @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath41 and therefore the cone approaches asymptotically to the plane @xmath42 with cylindrical metric of an effective radius @xmath43 which is the transverse metric used in string - like geometries @xcite .",
    "the angular resolved conifold metric component @xmath44 has a conical singularity depending on the resolution parameter .",
    "the scalar curvature of this 2-manifold is @xmath45 as shown in the fig .",
    "@xmath46 , this @xmath0-section is everywhere smooth for @xmath10 . since for @xmath9 this",
    "manifold is cone - like , its curvature vanishes except at the origin , where it diverges",
    ".    these issues motivated us to use this manifold as a prototype of extension of transverse spaces in the brane worlds .",
    "as a matter of fact , many authors have studied the localization of fields in spherical backgrounds whose transverse space has positive , constant and non - singular curvature @xcite .",
    "other authors investigated the behavior of fields on other less common geometries @xcite .",
    "since the resolved conifold is parameterized by the resolution parameter , by using resolved conifold as transverse manifold we can not only study the properties of the fields in this rich space as also we can study the effects that singular and smooth manifolds have on the localization of fields .",
    "now let us make a change of variables in order to write out the metric ( [ transversespacemetric ] ) of @xmath47 in a gaussian form @xmath48    by setting @xmath49 , we obtain a smooth change of variable @xmath50 given by @xmath51    then , the change of variable has the following form @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the elliptic integral of second kind .",
    "the shape of this change of variable is sketched in fig .",

    "the action for the gravitational field is is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the six - dimensional bulk planck mass and @xmath65 is the matter lagrangian for the source of the geometry .",

    "henceforward , we shall use the following warp function firstly proposed in @xcite @xmath71 where , @xmath72 whose dimension is @xmath73=l^{-1}$ ] .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention two important features of this warp function .",
    "first , as in the usual string - like geometries , the warp function vanishes asymptotically @xcite .",
    "second , the warp function chosen above , unlike the thin string - like geometries @xcite , satisfies the following conditions for regularity in the origin @xmath74 where , the prime @xmath75 stands for the derivative @xmath76 .",
    "this feature is due to the addition of the term @xmath77 that smooth the warp factor near the origin and converges to the string - like one for large @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , the warp function has a bell - shape as sketched in the fig . @xmath79",
    "therefore , we can realize this warp function as a near brane correction to the thin string - like models @xcite .",
    "for the thin models ( represented in fig .",
    "@xmath79 by a dotted line ) this warp factor function is defined for the exterior of string only and it can only be regard as defined for all @xmath78 whether the width of the core of the string - like brane is zero . for @xmath80",
    "the warp factor is presented in fig .",
    "@xmath79 by a thick line .",
    "besides , its derivative does not vanishes at the origin as required .    for the angular metric component , @xmath81 , we have chosen the following ansatz @xmath82 as in the thin string models , the angular metric component vanishes at infinity @xcite .",
    "however , a new feature occurs at the origin , where @xmath83 for a string - like geometry it is usually assumed the regularity condition @xcite    @xmath84    which is not satisfied for the exterior string solution @xcite    @xmath85    note that for @xmath29 there is a 4-brane @xmath86 whose metric is given by @xmath87    therefore , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the circle of radius @xmath6 and @xmath61 is obtained for @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the geometrical flow of the resolved conifold leads to a dimensional reduction @xmath90 in the origin .",

    "the angular component has a @xmath7 symmetry due to its zero derivative at origin . in fig .",
    "( [ angularcomponent ] ) , for @xmath9 ( dashed line ) , the component exhibits a conical behavior at the origin , which is expected for a string - like geometry . for @xmath34 and @xmath94 , respectively the thin and thick lines , the function acquires a bell - shape .",

    "the scalar curvature is plotted in the fig .",
    "( [ scalarcurvature ] ) for @xmath97 .",
    "note that the manifold has a smooth geometry everywhere and it approaches asymptotically to an @xmath8 which radius does not depend on the resolution parameter .",
    "this ensure us to claim that @xmath98 is an extension of the thin string models for both near and far from the brane .     and",
    "the manifold is smooth everywhere and it approaches asymptotically to an @xmath8 . ]    the properties of the scenario described above turned it an interesting extension of the string - like braneworld .",
    "indeed , it not only allows to regularize the geometry at the origin as it yields a geometric flow in the transverse space that changes the brane properties , as we shall see later .    in this work",
    ", we shall not deduce this geometric solution from a matter lagrangian .",
    "this would demand numerical analysis , as performed in ( @xcite ) that diverges of our aim .",
    "instead , following the same approach used in ( @xcite ) , our main goal is to study the behavior of the gauge field minimally coupled in this background when the geometry suffers a resolution flow . in order to investigate the physical feasibility of this model , in the next section we shall study the properties of the stress - energy - momentum tensor and the string tensions as well .      through the einstein equations , in this section we shall derive and study some physical quantities of this scenario , as the components of stress - energy - momentum tensor , the value of the cosmological constant , the string tensions and the relationship between the mass scales .",
    "firstly , let us assume a cylindrically symmetric ansatz for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath99 where , @xmath100    from the action ( [ action ] ) we obtain the einstein equations @xmath101    the metric ansatz ( [ metricansatz ] ) leads the einstein equations to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations , namely @xmath102 where , we assumed the 4-brane @xmath61 to be a maximally symmetric manifold whose four - dimensional cosmological constant on the 3-brane satisfies @xmath103 with , @xmath104 .",

    "it is worthwhile to say that all the components have compact support near the origin where the 3-brane is .",
    "this feature also appears in a string - like brane generated by a vortex @xcite .",
    "hence , the source of this geometry , whatever it be , has its energy content localized near the origin , and so the geometry is created by a local source .",
    "furthermore , the components satisfy weak energy conditions , unless for very tiny values of @xmath6 . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the energy conditions ( weak , strong and dominant ) are all fulfilled .",
    "these features turn this geometry a physical and realistic scenario , albeit exotic , since the components do not satisfy the dominant and the strong energy conditions for all values of @xmath6 . besides",
    ", the dominant energy condition is also broken in the gherghetta - schaposhnikov ( gs ) model ( infinitely thin string ) @xcite .    for large values of @xmath6 ,",
    "the energy density and the angular pressure converge equally for the same value and both are always greater than the radial pressure . besides , since all components decay quickly we can estimate a width of the brane and it decreases as @xmath6 increases .",
    "+     +     +    another consequence of this geometry is that the bulk has a negative cosmological constant . indeed , for large @xmath78",
    ", the components of energy momentum tensor vanish and the vacuum solution of the einstein equations yields the well - known relationship @xcite : @xmath110      an important quantity of the brane is the so - called the brane tension .",
    "we define the 4-tension per unit of volume of the 3-brane , as @xcite    @xmath111    note that @xmath112=m^{4}$ ] . the energy string tension is sometimes called the mass _ per _ unit of volume of the string .",
    "it is useful to define the tensions _ per _ unit of length by means of a smooth function @xmath113 given by    @xmath114    we have plotted @xmath115 for some values of @xmath6 in the figures ( [ stringtension_0]),([stringtension_1 ] ) , ( [ stringtension_10 ] ) . by means of the graphic it is possible to see that for large values of @xmath6 the energy tension @xmath116 is always greater than the radial tension @xmath117 and the angular tension @xmath118 .",
    "this result also appears in the other string - like defects @xcite . in gs model , for instance ,",
    "the authors have taken an infinitely thin brane with @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , the differences @xmath120 and @xmath121 decrease when @xmath6 decreases .",
    "+     +     +      in the last section , we have seen that string tensions , including the string mass , depend on the evolution parameter @xmath6 .",
    "now we wish to study how the geometric evolution alters the relation between the bulk and brane mass scale .    in this geometry ,",
    "the relationship between the four - dimensional planck mass ( @xmath122 ) and the bulk planck mass ( @xmath123 ) is given by @xcite @xmath124    due to the complexity of the warp factor and the angular metric component , it is a difficult task to find the integral in eq .",
    "however , we can study it qualitatively .",
    "since all the metric components are limited functions , this geometry has a finite volume and then , it can be used to tuning the ratio between the planck masses explaining the hierarchy between them .",
    "note , however , that the relationship between the planck masses depends on the evolution parameter @xmath6 .    in order to study the behavior of @xmath126 we defined the function @xmath127 given by @xmath128",
    "whose integral over @xmath78 provides the desired ratio .",

    "@xmath129 where we can conclude that as higher the value of @xmath6 is , higher is the value of @xmath130 .     and",
    "@xmath80 . as @xmath6 increases ( @xmath9 is the dashed line",
    ", @xmath34 is the dotted line and @xmath94 is the thick one ) m takes higher values and its integral ( which gives the relation between the mass scales ) also . ]    hence , a evolution of the bulk geometry through a geometrical flow , as the resolved conifold , could alters the hierarchy between the fundamental energy scales in the bulk and in the brane .",
    "this is an extension to the string - like gs model tuning of the planck masses since in this model the relationship is accomplished by fixed geometrical constants , e.g. , the bulk cosmological constant and the angular tension @xcite . as usual in braneworld models , the bulk mass scale is chosen in the scale .",

    "in this work we have studied how the geometrical and physical properties of a warped braneworld scenario builded from a @xmath1-brane and a @xmath0-cycle of the resolved conifold change when this manifold evolves under the resolution flow .",
    "then , we analyzed the behavior of the vector gauge field in this axysymmetric and static six dimensional space - time .",
    "firstly , we have shown that this is a physical feasible scenario , since the weak energy condition is satisfied for all values of the resolution parameter @xmath6 and for @xmath9 , the source obeys the dominant energy condition . moreover , since the transverse manifold has finite volume with negative cosmological constant that does not depend on the resolution parameter and in addition , the bulk is everywhere smooth , this geometry can be regarded as a near brane extension of the well - known thin string - like brane solutions .",
    "the string tension conditions of the thin string branes are also fulfilled , albeit the radial tension is not zero .",
    "further , the relation between the bulk and brane scale energy increases when the parameter increases .    in the analysis of @xmath2wave state of the gauge vector field in this scenario we obtained a normalizable massless mode and a kaluza - klein modes near the brane .",
    "we found that the resolution parameter avoids the zero mode to vanish on the brane ( what happen whether @xmath206 ) and provides a @xmath7 symmetry to this mode .",
    "thus , we argue that resolution parameter smoothes the vector modes near the brane and it agrees with the string - like zero - mode for large distances .    moreover , the zero - mode satisfies the schroedinger - like equation for @xmath163 , as required .",
    "the potential has an infinite potential well for @xmath9 what leads to tachyonic modes on the brane . for @xmath207 ,",
    "the potential is positive and repulsive at the origin .",
    "the massive modes are smooth near the brane and have the same behavior of the string - like model asymptotically .",
    "then , the resolution parameter allows the existence of a well - defined vector zero - mode and avoids kk and tachyonic modes on the brane .    for future works we intend to study the behaviour of the gauge vector field for @xmath208 , and to study other fields in this background as well .",
