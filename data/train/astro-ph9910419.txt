    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) and their central stars ( css ) have been used for decades as probes to the final phases of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the nebular gas expelled at the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and sculpted by radiation and a cs fast wind , acquires a shape that depends upon the combination of the distribution of gas and dust in the circumstellar shell , and upon the local ism environment .",
    "it it thus important to study nebulae and stars together to obtain a more complete understanding of the final phases of stellar evolution .    since the pioneering work by greig ( 1972 )",
    ", pn morphology has been associated to stellar population and , by inference , to the cs mass ( see stanghellini 1995 for a review ) ; the latest finding on the correlations between nebular morphology and stellar evolution / population ( e.g. , manchado , this volume ) certainly show that there is a strong trend that connects large masses stars and asymmetric pne .",
    "nonetheless , to date the ( sometime very ) convincing trends that link the evolution of stars and nebulae have been criticized for the biases and uncertainties inherent in the distance scale for galactic pne . on these grounds",
    ", we decided to pursue the investigation in the large magellanic cloud , where uncertain distances are not an issue .",
    "a study of this type is presently only possible with the capability of the _ hubble space telescope_. in this short communication we present the aims our project , some limited analysis of smp-27 , and a roadmap to future developments .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) pne have a typical size of @xmath0half an arcsecond . for this reason , their morphology ( and size )",
    "make them suitable targets for the hst . as of this writing ,",
    "the only published hst data on magellanic cloud pne are monochromatic images obtained by dopita ( dopita 1996 ) using wfpc-1 , and blades ( 1992 ) using foc ( see also stanghellini 1999 ) , on a grand total of 30 pne .",
    "both sets suffer from spherical aberration of the hst primary mirror prior to the first servicing mission .",
    "a third set of lmc pne is available in the hst data archive ( pi = dopita ) , which includes 14 objects observed in monochromatic lines with wfpc2 . clearly , to perform an lmc pn study of the type of that reported by stanghellini ( 1993 ) for galactic pne",
    ", there is the need for a lager database .",
    "for this reason we pursued our slit - less spectroscopic study of 50 lmc pne . we chose to obtain slitless spectra in order to determine the pn shapes in a range of different ionization levels .",
    "in particular , we aim at obtaining _",
    "monochromatic _ images in the major nebular lines such , [ o iii ] , , [ n ii ] , [ o i ] , he i and [ s ii ] .",
    "our program was approved as a hst cycle 8 snapshot . when deciding on our target list , we choose pne within a large span in the and [ o iii ] fluxes .",
    "images of the pne were obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) in white ( 50ccd ) light , and with the medium - dispersion gratings g430 m and g750 m , which allowed us to obtain the morphologies in the traditional lines ( [ o iii ] , , and [ n ii ] , as well as the others mentioned above . the image of smp-27 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the slitless spectrograms provides both the spectral and spatial information , thus in this image we see the emission nebula and the material surrounding it .",
    "the planetary nebula smp-27 is very clearly quadrupolar , and shows this type of morphology in all prominent spectral lines .",
    "the ring segment and the blob of outer material that we were able to observe around this nebula are suggestive of a previous ejection event from the pn progenitor , or , possibly , a remnant of the prior agb fast wind .",
    "the absence of an obvious , nearby source of ionizing radiation , and the decline in the ionization level ( as measured by the ratio of the [ o iii ] and images ) makes the association of the distant arc and blob with the cs fairly secure .",
    "a quick analysis shows that smp-27 is a high excitation pn of approximately 0.85 arcsec of diameter ( encircling 95 % of the nebular light ) , corresponding to 0.106 pc .",
    "the separation between the main nebular body and the north - west arc is about 1.53 pc , while the arc itself is 2 pc long .",
    "there is also a fainter blob of material 14.6 deg east of north .",
    "the nebula is also detected in the follwoing lines : @xmath1 6678 he i , @xmath1 6584 [ n ii ] , @xmath1 6548 [ n ii ] , @xmath1 4959 [ o iii ] .",
    "the calculated reddening for this pn is zero .",
    "the star has a hot spectrum , more prominent in the blue than in the red , which is consistent with the relatively high nebular ionization .",
    "the estimated magnitude of the cs is v@xmath219.6 . a preliminary estimate of the luminosity and temperature yields log l@xmath32.7 and log t@xmath4 by using the hydrogen line intensities .",
    "as this pn appears to be optically thin , the derived l & t are probably lower limits to the actual luminosity and temperature .",
    "at the time of writing , this project just getting underway .",
    "but the exceptional data quality prompted us to present a preview of the results .",
    "the overall analysis of the morphological sample will be done once the bulk of the observations are complete .",
    "morphology , size , expansion age , and central star physics will be studied for the homogeneous dataset .",
    "ground based spectroscopy will be used , together with the available data in the literature , to probe the relationship between morphology and stellar evolution , including the yield of the pn progenitors .",
