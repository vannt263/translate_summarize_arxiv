    "the uncertainty is low if the average read - out level @xmath9 responds sensitively to changes in ligand concentration , as measured by the gain @xmath10 , but is not noisy , as measured by the variance @xmath11 .    if the receptor - ligand complex itself is taken as the read - out , then the error is : @xmath12 since @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the probability a receptor is bound to ligand .",
    "indeed , @xmath15 is the `` instantaneous error '' , _",
    "i.e. _ the sensing error based on a single concentration estimate via a single receptor .",
    "because each receptor provides an independent concentration measurement ( @xcite ) , the total number of independent measurements is @xmath16 .",
    "clearly , the sensing error is limited by the total number of receptors on the membrane .",
    "cells can reduce the error in eq .",
    "[ eq : receperr ] with downstream networks that time - integrate over the history of receptor states ( @xcite ) .",
    "key to the ability of networks to time - integrate is a memory of these past states , implemented , for example , by a long - lived molecular species or a signaling cascade that delays the signal ( @xcite ) .",
    "equilibrium systems can have these and hence have memory of the past receptor states .",
    "thus , we might expect that equilibrium networks can reduce the sensing error past the bound set by the number of receptors at the expense of downstream signaling molecules .",
    "we consider cytoplasmic read - out molecules @xmath6 that bind ligand - free receptors : @xmath4 , @xmath17 .",
    "solving the associated langevin equations ( _ materials and methods _ ) shows that the dynamics of the output around its mean @xmath18 is given by the time - integrated fluctuations @xmath19 in the receptor state plus noise @xmath20 due to the receptor - read - out binding : @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the integration time .",
    "the latter can be made arbitrarily large by slowing down the read - out dynamics , i.e. by lowering @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this suggests that equilibrium networks can completely filter the extrinsic noise in the receptor states and reduce the sensing error to zero .",
    "however , the idea that the sensing error can be reduced to zero ignores the fact that in these equilibrium systems ligand - receptor binding and receptor - read - out binding are coupled . in this specific system , these reactions are coupled because the read - out and the ligand compete for binding to the receptor .    to elucidate how the coupling between receptor - ligand binding and receptor - read - out binding compromises sensing in equilibrium networks , we determine the total sensing error . from eq .",
    "[ eq : lang ] , the variance of the output @xmath26 can be written as the sum of the extrinsic noise @xmath27 and the intrinsic noise @xmath28 , where @xmath29 with the correlation function @xmath30 .",
    "combining @xmath11 with the gain @xmath31 gives the sensing error for this network ( eq . [ eq : error ] ) . analytically minimizing the result",
    ", we find that it is never lower than the bound set by the number of receptors ( i.e. @xmath32 in eq .",
    "[ eq : receperr ] ) , regardless of the integration time or other parameters of the network ( _ si text _ ) .",
    "this raises the paradox of a network that time - integrates the receptor fluctuations yet can not reduce the sensing error with it .",
    "the resolution of the paradox is that in equilibrium systems the intrinsic and extrinsic noise are not independent , precisely because receptor - ligand and receptor - readout binding are coupled . as a result , the fluctuations in the receptor state and the read - out become correlated ; @xmath33 is not zero ( @xcite ) . because of these correlations , equilibrium networks face a fundamental trade - off between the removal of extrinsic noise in the receptor state and the suppression of intrinsic in the downstream signaling network . in an optimally designed network that minimizes",
    "the sensor error , increasing the integration time reduces the extrinsic noise , but also increases the intrinsic noise by at least the same amount .    signaling networks are usually far more complicated than a single read - out molecule that binds the receptor , and it has been shown that additional network layers can reduce the sensing error ( @xcite ) .",
    "this raises the question whether a more complicated equilibrium network can overcome the limit set by the number of receptors .",
    "searching over all possible network topologies to systematically address this question is difficult , if not impossible .",
    "however , equilibrium systems are fundamentally bounded by the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics , regardless of their topology .",
    "one such law is the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "just as a decrease in the viscosity of a fluid increases both the noise in a particle s brownian motion and the sensitivity of its response to an applied force , so too do modifications in equilibrium networks affect both the noise in the read - out and the sensitivity of its response to changes in the ligand concentration , _",
    "i.e. _ the gain .",
    "specifically , for any read - out @xmath6 in an equilibrium system , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies that the gain @xmath34 is equal to the covariance @xmath35 of the fluctuations in the read - out and the ligand - bound receptor : @xmath36 ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the sensing error from any read - out is ( eq . [ eq : error ] ) : @xmath37 . if the receptors themselves are taken as the read - out , the sensing error is @xmath38 . by combining these expressions",
    ", it follows that no read - out is better for sensing than the receptors : @xmath39 since the correlation coefficient @xmath40    this relation leads to quantitative bounds on the sensing capacity of equilibrium networks .",
    "in general , the variance @xmath41 , and hence @xmath42 , depends on the particular network .",
    "however , for any network , @xmath43 since @xmath44 .",
    "thus , for equilibrium systems , the fundamental lower bound on the fractional error in the concentration estimate is : @xmath45 this proves that in equilibrium systems , which are not driven by fuel turnover , the precision of sensing is fundamentally limited by the number of receptors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eqneqdiag ] , upper box ) ; a downstream signaling network can never improve the accuracy of sensing",
    ".    networks in which the receptors cooperatively bind the ligand can achieve the bound of eq .",
    "[ eq : bound_eq_net ] ( _ si text _ ) . for networks without cooperative ligand",
    "binding , as in the simple example above , the sensing error is worse : @xmath46 , so @xmath47 ( _ si text _ ) .",
    "the sensing error for independent receptor binding is most easily understood for receptors with identical affinity for the ligand , as in our simple example ( eq . [ eq : receperr ] ) , but holds generally : different affinities do not break this bound .",
    "the different species in a network can also be viewed as nodes through which information about the ligand flows .",
    "we can show that the data processing inequality ( @xcite ) also guarantees , for an equilibrium system , that no read - out has more information about the ligand than the receptors at any given time : @xmath48x@xmath49rl@xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mutual information between the instantaneous levels of the arguments ( _ si text _ ) .",
    "the history of receptor states does contain more information about the ligand concentration than the instantaneous receptor state , but our results show that an equilibrium signaling network can not exploit this : its output contains only as much information as the instantaneous receptor state ; it does not encode the history of receptor states in any informative way , whether by time - integration or any other method .",
    "ultimately , equilibrium systems sense by harvesting the energy of ligand binding .",
    "this energy is used to propagate the signal through the downstream network ; in the simple system studied here , for example , the energy of ligand binding is used to expel the read - out molecule from the receptor .",
    "however , detailed balance then dictates that the receptor - read - out binding also influences receptor - ligand binding , thus perturbing the signal .",
    "indeed , the trade - offs faced by equilibrium networks are all different manifestations of their time - reversibility ( @xcite ) . the only way for a time - reversible system to `` integrate '' the past is for it to integrate ",
    "perturb  the future .",
    "concomitantly , in a time reversible system , there is no sense of `` upstream '' and `` downstream '' , concepts which rely on a direction of time .",
    "although we have referred to the molecule @xmath6 as a `` readout '' of the ligand concentration , the ligand is just as much a readout of @xmath6 .",
    "while in equilibrium systems the read - out encodes the receptor state , the read - out is not a stable memory that is decoupled from changes in the receptor state .",
    "it merely passively lags . in an equilibrium system , the sensing error , like any static quantity , can only depend on ratios of time scales , which is another way of seeing that increasing the `` integration time '' can not improve sensing .",
    "these results show that in an equilibrium system each receptor provides at most one independent measurement of the ligand , regardless of how much information is encoded in the history of the receptor state , how complicated the signaling machinery is downstream , how many molecules are devoted to signaling downstream , or how long the apparent integration time of the network is . energy dissipation  fuel turnover  is required to break the trade - offs between noise and sensitivity , between intrinsic and extrinsic noise , and , ultimately , between the accuracy of sensing and space on the membrane .",
    "networks that can reduce error via time - integration must be non - equilibrium systems . to understand the resources required to reduce the sensing error in these systems , we need to understand how they sense at the molecular level .",
    "berg and purcell pointed out that by integrating the receptor signal over a time @xmath0 , the cell can take as many as @xmath52 independent samples of the receptor state ( @xcite ) , where @xmath53 is the receptor correlation time .",
    "we will show that the cost of sensing depends on how many of these samples the cell actually takes .",
    "we therefore view the downstream network , which consists of discrete components , as a system that discretely samples the receptor state , rather than integrating it .    ) .",
    "( b ) the biochemical network in ( a ) discretely samples the receptor state , illustrated for one receptor .",
    "the states of the receptor over time are encoded in the states of the @xmath54 molecules that collided with it : the readout is modified if the receptor is bound ; otherwise it is unmodified .",
    "molecules that collide with the unbound receptor are indistinguishable from those that have never collided , leading to an additional error .",
    "( c ) active molecules can be degraded .",
    "some samples are erased , and the remaining samples are , on average , further apart ( more independent . ) ( d ) all reactions are in principle reversible , compromising the encoding of the receptor state into the readout .",
    "the sensing error is determined by parameters that describe the energy flow in the network , including the flux @xmath55 and the free - energy drops @xmath56 and @xmath57 across the activation and deactivation reactions of the readout , respectively.[fig : sensing],width=321 ]    .    to gain intuition about the resources required to build and operate these networks , we construct step by step a model of a receptor that drives a push - pull network , which is a canonical non - equilibrium motif in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell signaling ( @xcite ) . in these systems ,",
    "the receptor itself or the enzyme associated with it , such as chea in bacterial chemotaxis ( @xcite ) , catalyzes the ( chemical ) modification of a read - out protein .",
    "the general principle is that these networks take samples of the receptor by storing its state in the stable modification states of the read - out molecules ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sensing]a , b ) .",
    "each read - out molecule that interacted with the receptor provides a memory of the ligand - occupation state of that receptor molecule ; collectively , the read - out molecules encode the history of the receptor states .",
    "quantitatively , if there are @xmath54 receptor - readout interactions , then the cell has @xmath54 samples of the receptor state and the error , @xmath58 , is reduced by a factor of @xmath59 , as in eq .",
    "[ eq : receperr ] , or less if the samples are not independent . by building up the model step by step ,",
    "we seek to understand how different features of the network affect the number of samples , their independence , and their accuracy .",
    "one feature is that molecules can be deactivated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sensing]c ) , which we will show is equivalent to discarding or erasing samples",
    ". additionally , reactions are microscopically reversible ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sensing]d ) , which means that read - out modifications can occur independently of the receptor and receptor - mediated modifications can occur in the wrong direction ; both effects reduce the reliability of a sample .",
    "energy is needed to break time - reversibility and to protect the coding .",
    "we arrive at an expression for the sensing error that combines these effects .",
    "it reveals trade - offs between cellular resources and performance : speed , accuracy , energy , and the number of receptor and downstream molecules .",
    "for intuition , we first consider a cell that responds after a time @xmath0 to a change in a ligand s concentration at some time @xmath60 , based on the output @xmath61 of the simple reaction network @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sensing]a ) .",
    "we assume that the cell starts with a large pool of inactive read - out molecules @xmath6 and that activated molecules @xmath61 are never deactivated . for descriptive ease , we assume the reaction is diffusion - limited , so that each collision between an inactive molecule @xmath6 and a ligand - bound receptor leads to activation of @xmath6 . the resulting sensing error can be derived via eq .",

    "our analysis reveals why it may be beneficial to use this energy consuming motif : it makes it possible to store the history of the receptor state in stable chemical modification states of downstream molecules . in equilibrium sensing the stability of the downstream signaling proteins relies on physical interactions with the receptor molecules , which means that the state of the readout molecules reflects the instantaneous state of the receptor .",
    "in contrast , in non - equilibrium sensing the energy to change the state of the signaling proteins is not provided by the physical interactions with the receptor , but by the chemical fuel .",
    "the receptor catalyzes the modification of the read - out . after modification , however , the receptor and read - out become decoupled and each read - out molecule provides a stable memory of the receptor state when it was modified .",
    "it is this feature that allows these non - equilibriums systems to take samples of the receptor state over time and perform a discrete time integration .",
    "this increases the number of measurements per receptor , making it possible to beat the equilibrium sensing limit set by the number of receptors .",

    "of course , additional constraints can not improve the performance of the network beyond the bounds required here , nor can they alter the fact that all the resources are needed for sensing .",
    "networks are often more complicated than a simple one - level push - pull cascade . we investigate some common motifs to understand whether they relax the trade - offs faced by sensory networks .    _ multi - level cascades _ : often the signaling molecule activated by the receptor is not taken as the final read - out ; rather that molecule catalyzes the activation of another molecule , and so on in a signaling cascade .",
    "all of the molecules are reversibly degraded . using the same approach as for the one - level cascade , we find that the sensing error is bounded by the work done driving just the last step of the cascade : @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is the product of the flux of the last molecule through its cycle and the free - energy drop across that cycle , and @xmath103 is the slowest relaxation time in the cascade ( i.e. the reciprocal of the largest eigenvalue of the relaxation matrix . ) even more work is done at other levels of the cascade .",
    "the results suggest that cascades do not enable more energy efficient sensing .",
    "additionally , each sample of an active state ( bound receptor or active molecule upstream ) still requires a molecule to store it .    _ positive and negative feedback _ : a simple model of positive feedback is autocatalysis , in which the receptor - catalyzed activation of the read - out is enhanced by the activated form of the read - out , @xmath61 : @xmath324 .",
    "a simple model of negative feedback can be implemented by requiring inactive @xmath6 for the activation : @xmath325 . in both cases",

    "_ cooperative activation of the read - out _ :",
    "if the catalytic activation of the read - out is mediated cooperatively by the receptors ( i.e. @xmath327 ) , then the error is reduced by a factor @xmath328 for the same amount of energy .",
    "one way to interpret the result is that each sample requires the same amount of energy as before , but the samples are individually more informative because they reflect @xmath221 ligand bindings , instead of one  indeed , the instantaneous error is lower .",
    "to understand how energy shapes the design of a network , we modify the push - pull network so that the read - out actually binds the ligand - bound receptor , which can boot the read - out off in a modified state : @xmath329 , @xmath180 .",
    "the active read - out decays , as before : @xmath170 .",
    "the reaction @xmath180 coarse - grains the reactions @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; explicitly adding these reaction gives the same results because they essentially can always be integrated out .",

    "no resources are coarse - grained in these reductions , though the latter breaks the retroactivity of receptor - read - out binding : energy is required to break reversibility , not retroactivity .",
    "we focus on the relationship between the number of receptors ( the equilibrium resource ) and the work ( a non - equilibrium resource ) , as the network shifts from binding to catalysis .",
    "the work is defined as @xmath332 , as in the main text , where the relaxation time @xmath103 is chosen as the negative reciprocal of the smallest eigenvalue of the regression matrix of the network . from a scaling argument and dimensional analysis",

    "we also continued the best solutions over variations in the constraints to probe the global minima .",
    "as seen in the figure , when the work per receptor is less than about @xmath175 @xmath172 , the equilibrium scheme of binding is optimal , recovering the equilibrium bound for the sensing error , @xmath337 ( eq . 2 in the main text with @xmath338 ) .",

    "there is an intermediate regime in which the network outperforms both these regimes by partially utilizing the bound receptor - read - out state .",
    "in the main text , we argue that the tnf newtork could transmit much more than one bit if it were time / receptor limited . here",
    ", we describe how we arrived at that conclusion .",
    "even if the integration time of the network were zero and the network did not integrate the receptor state , it would still be able to transmit the information in the instantaneous receptor state .",
    "the information about the ligand concentration , @xmath5 , in the instantaneous receptor occupancy , @xmath341 , is given by : @xmath342 to arrive at this result , we calculated the information transfer of a biochemical system that takes the receptor occupancy , and not a downstream readout , as the final output .",
    "we assumed simple ligand - binding kinetics , @xmath343 , and assumed that ligand binding is not affected by any downstream processes .",
    "more complicated kinetics ( e.g. cooperativity ) would likely increase the instantaneous information transfer .",
    "the result assumes that the ligand - binding kinetics are optimized with respect to the distribution of input concentrations of the ligand ; i.e. the information transfer calculated is the channel capacity of the network .",
    "the channel capacity is the appropriate quantity to consider , because it is the experimentally reported quantity in the paper by ( @xcite ) .",
    "we followed the method in @xcite to calculate the channel capacity .",
    "tnf signaling utilizes @xmath344 receptors on the cell surface ( @xcite ) , corresponding to @xmath345 bits of information .",
    "if the network integrates the receptor state , the information could be even higher .",
    "the fact that the actual information transfer is instead much less than 5 bits suggests that receptors / time do not limit the accuracy of sensing , but rather another resource , such as copy numbers of signaling components or energy .",
    "the following paragraphs address various nuances to the above argument .",
    "first , note that restrictions on the probability distribution of inputs can prevent the system from achieving the channel capacity .",
    "this is true both for our bound and for the calculated information transmission through the entire network in the paper by cheong _",
    "one biologically relevant restriction on the probability distribution of inputs is the support of the distribution , particularly the maximum biologically relevant concentration of the ligand ; if achieving the channel capacity requires input distributions with large probability for concentrations that are much higher than those biologically observed , then the channel capacity is not really a relevant measure for the capacity of the network .",
    "important in this context is that the dissociation constant @xmath346 for tnf binding is 0.323 ng / ml ( @xcite ) , about the same as the half - saturation for the tnf response as measured by cheong _ et al._. so achieving the channel capacity at the level of the receptors does not require higher concentrations than achieving the channel capacity of the whole network .",
    "this means that , while restrictions on the maximum input concentration would prevent the system from achieving the channel capacity of 5.5 bits at the level of the receptors , they would also prevent the system from achieving the channel capacity of 1 bit at the level of the output , maintaining the discrepancy .",
    "the above arguments assume that a ) the principal role of the signaling network is to time integrate the receptor , and b ) that this improves information transmission if energy and the copy numbers of the signaling molecules are not limiting , and the network is hence not too noisy . however , signaling systems with enough fuel and signaling molecules that time - integrate the receptor , do not necessarily increase information transmission .",
    "they can also reduce information transmission by collapsing many input states onto the same output state .",
    "this can happen when the input - output relation is ( strongly ) non - linear .",
    "however , the experimental data in the paper by cheong _ et al . _ suggest that this is not the case for the tnf network , as the response increases mono - modally and gradually with the input .",
    "in fact , the output is also noisy .",
    "indeed , the authors attribute the loss of information transmission to biochemical noise , which , according to our analysis , could be due to limiting amounts of readout molecules or energy .",
    "a final note is that while the above arguments show that the number of receptors and time are not limiting and suggest that downstream molecules or energy are limiting , it is can not be ruled out that other sources of noise , which we have not modeled , are instead limiting . for example , the sensing precision could be limited by cell - to - cell variability in the copy numbers of signaling molecules ( expression or capacity noise ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "these could even involve variations in the number of receptors themselves .",
    "however , back - of - the - envelop calculations suggest that such variations are not enough to explain the discrepancy above . moreover , many biological systems , including some two - component systems , are insulated against fluctuations in protein expression ( @xcite ) , supporting the idea that in these cases energy or protein copy numbers are indeed limiting the accuracy of sensing ."

    "<S> the relationship between the accuracy of sensing , the design of the network , and the resources required to build and operate it  time , energy and protein copies  underlies the design principles of biochemical sensing systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we first study the relationship between sensing precision , network design , and resources , for systems that are not driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium , consuming no fuel . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these equilibrium networks can time - integrate the receptor signal to remove the extrinsic noise in it , analogous to the mechanism described by berg and purcell . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , fuel is not a fundamental resource for sensing or removing extrinsic noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , we will show that equilibrium networks face a fundamental trade - off between the removal of extrinsic noise in the receptor state and the suppression of intrinsic noise in the processing network : decreasing one source of noise necessarily increases the other . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of sensing is fundamentally limited by the number of receptors ; in equilibrium networks , adding downstream components can never improve the sensing precision .    to improve the sensing accuracy beyond the limit set by the number of receptors , it is essential to break the trade - off between extrinsic and intrinsic noise . as we show </S>",
    "<S> , this requires a fundamentally different sensing mechanism . instead of using the receptors to harvest the energy of ligand binding , as in the equilibrium sensing mode </S>",
    "<S> , the receptors should be used as catalysts to modify downstream read - out molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this non - equilibrium strategy , however , uses not only receptors but requires also time , copies of downstream read - out molecules , and fuel turnover .    we quantify the limits that arise from each of the resources  copies of receptors and downstream molecules , time , and fuel  for a canonical signaling motif , a receptor that drives a goldbeter - koshland push - pull network ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> push - pull networks are ubiquitous in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell signaling ( @xcite ) : examples include gtpase cycles , as in the ras system ( @xcite ) , and phosphorylation cycles , as in mitogen - activated - protein - kinase ( mapk ) cascades ( @xcite ) or in two - component systems like the chemotaxis system of _ escherichia coli _ ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resource limitations of these systems emerge naturally when the signaling networks are viewed as devices that discretely , rather than continuously , sample the receptor state via collisions of the signaling molecules with the receptor proteins . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis reveals that three classes of resources are required : i ) time and receptors ; ii ) copies of downstream molecules ; and iii ) fuel . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , these classes can not compensate each other : each imposes a sensing limit , and it is the limiting class that imposes the fundamental limit on the accuracy of sensing . </S>",
    "<S> however , there can be trade - offs within each class of resources . </S>",
    "<S> receptors and time trade off against each other in achieving a desired sensing accuracy and power and response time trade off against each other to meet the energy requirement for taking a measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we end by discussing how our findings apply to specific signaling systems and how our results on push - pull networks generalize to more complex networks involving cascades , and positive and negative feedback . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our analysis leads to a concrete prediction for the optimal resource allocation , which we test for the _ e. coli _ chemotaxis system . </S>"
