    "we check consistency between our work and the s11 s work using the protocluster lbg sample .",
    "the ly@xmath0 scale length of the protocluster lbg sample ( @xmath78kpc ) is similar to that of the s11 s full sample ( @xmath79kpc ) , both of which are derived from median stacking . in contrast , the uv - continuum scale length of the protocluster lbg sample ( @xmath80kpc ) seems to be larger than s11 s one ( @xmath81kpc ) .",

    "the ly@xmath0 scale length of the protocluster lbgs is close to that of the lae sub - sample with a similar over - density ( left panel ) but larger than those of the @xmath40 magnitude divided sub - samples ( right panel ) .",
    "these results suggest that ly@xmath0 scale length is a strong function of the mpc - scale lae surface density rather than the central uv luminosity .",
    "using samples of 2128 laes and 24 protocluster lbgs at @xmath1 , we examine ly@xmath0 surface brightness profiles as a function of environment or central uv luminosity .",
    "our results show that the ly@xmath0 scale lengths are roughly proportional to the square of the mpc - scale lae surface densities ( @xmath3 ) , but are almost independent of the central uv luminosities .",
    "the apparent profiles of the ly@xmath0 haloes should be determined by a combination of gas distribution around galaxies and source(s ) of ly@xmath0 photons ( e.g. , r08 ; s11 ) . including the ly@xmath0 haloes , the rest - frame ly@xmath0 equivalent widths of all the density divided lae sub - samples are larger than @xmath94  expected for star - forming galaxies with continuous star formation lasting @xmath95yrs ( e.g. , s11 ) and that in the over - dense region almost reaches the maximum value of @xmath96  for very young ( @xmath97yrs ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that ly@xmath0 photons formed via shock compression by gas outflows @xcite or cooling radiation by gravitational gas inflows @xcite partly contribute to illuminate the ly@xmath0 haloes especially in over - dense environment .",
    "however , more than half of the ly@xmath0 luminosity from the haloes can be explained by photo - ionisation by ionising photons or scattering of ly@xmath0 photons produced from hii regions in and around the central galaxies in any case .    although the cgm structure could be modified by gas inflow / outflow processes @xcite , the overall structure is likely to follow the dark matter distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from cosmological numerical simulations , @xcite predicted that ly@xmath0 surface brightness profiles are made from a combination of dark matter s one - halo and two - halo contributions with a transition scale of @xmath98kpc for a @xmath99m@xmath100 halo .",
    "accounting for this model , our results can be qualitatively interpreted as follows : the observed steeper slope of the ly@xmath0 haloes in under - dense regions mainly represent the one - halo term while the flatter slope in over - dense regions is dominated by the two - halo term . in this case , it is not surprising if the ly@xmath0 spatial extents are determined by the surrounding mpc - scale environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this interpretation seems to be supported by the known tight links between individually detected labs and the surrounding large - scale structure : giant labs have been preferentially discovered in galaxy over - dense regions on mpc - scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this study is the first attempt at investigating ly@xmath0 haloes around high-@xmath2 galaxies in a wide range of environment and central uv luminosity .",
    "however , we lack a sample of uv - bright galaxies with deep ly@xmath0 imaging in average to moderate galaxy density environment as shown in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    ". it would be interesting to test if the ly@xmath0 haloes around uv - selected galaxies also show such strong environmental dependence .",
    "in addition to ly@xmath0 haloes , our data hint extended continuum haloes at least for uv continuum bright lae sub - samples .",
    "although we focus on only ly@xmath0 haloes in this paper , further studies of the uv continuum haloes will be important to investigate hii regions in the cgm .",
    "moreover , future @xmath101deg@xmath77 ly@xmath0 imaging survey with subaru / hyper suprime - cam will provide us with @xmath102k lae sample ( per redshift slice ) at @xmath103 and enable us to study the redshift evolution of the cgm structure via ly@xmath0 haloes .",
