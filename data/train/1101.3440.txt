    "after more than twenty years of outstanding efforts , the geometry of quantum groups , especially the relationships between their representation theories at roots of unity and the underlying lie groups , remains a prominent matter of quantum topology .",
    "it stands , for instance , in the background of the geometric realization problem of the combinatorially defined state spaces of the reshetikhin - turaev tqft ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the deformation quantization of character varieties of @xmath2-manifolds via skein modules @xcite , or the asymptotic expansion of quantum invariants ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) , @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    ", new and completely unexpected interactions between the _ non restricted _ quantum group @xmath7 and @xmath2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry have been revealed by the volume conjecture @xcite , and the subsequent development of the quantum hyperbolic field theories ( qhft ) @xcite and quantum teichmller theory @xcite .",
    "the global picture is that many of the fondamental invariants of hyperbolic ( ie .",
    "@xmath8 ) geometry , like the volume of hyperbolic manifolds , and more generally ( some of the ) chern - simons invariants of @xmath2-manifolds with flat @xmath6-connections , should be determined by the semi - classical limits of these quantum algebraic objects .    like any topological quantum field theory ,",
    "the qhft are symmetric tensor functors defined on a category of @xmath2-dimensional bordisms . for qhft ,",
    "these are equipped with additional structures given by refinements of holonomy representations in @xmath8 , and links up to isotopy .",
    "the qhft are built from `` local '' basic datas , universally encoded by the moduli space of isometry classes of `` flattened '' ( a kind a framing ) hyperbolic ideal @xmath2-simplices , and the associativity constraint , or _",
    "@xmath3-symbols _ , of the cyclic representations of a borel subalgebra @xmath9 of @xmath10 at a primitive root of unity @xmath1 of odd order .",
    "working with such a moduli space allows one to define the qhft also for @xmath2-dimensional bordisms equipped with holonomies having singularities along the links , like cusped hyperbolic manifolds ( the link being `` at infinity '' ) , and to get surgery formulas . for cylindrical bordisms the qhft are related by this way to the local version of quantum teichmller theory ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the chern - simons gauge theory for flat @xmath6-connections , which was originally derived from the integral complex - valued invariant `` volume '' @xmath2-form of @xmath11 via secondary characteristic class theory , defines a functor by means of the same moduli space as the qhft , using neumann s simplicial formulas @xcite in place of quantum state sums , where a dilogarithm function formally corresponds to the cyclic @xmath3-symbols of @xmath9 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , both maps are @xmath2-cocycloids in a natural way , the latter on the category of cyclic @xmath9-modules with ( partially defined ) tensor product , and the former on the group @xmath8 with discrete topology , via neumann s isomorphism of @xmath12 with a certain extension of the bloch group .    in this paper",
    "we consider this interplay of abelian vs. non abelian cohomological structures , which certainly concentrates a key part of the quantization procedure relating the chern - simons theory for @xmath8 to the qhft .",
    "we describe in detail the non abelian part of the story , that is , how the simple @xmath13-modules `` fiber '' over @xmath8 , and the @xmath3-symbols of _ regular",
    "_ @xmath10-modules ( rather than the cyclic @xmath9-modules ) . by the way we indicate common features and discrepancies with the @xmath3-symbols of the _ color modules _ of the _ restricted _ quantum group @xmath14 .",
    "we point out also that the cyclic @xmath3-symbols of @xmath9 , or ( basic ) _ matrix dilogarithms _ , coincide with the regular @xmath3-symbols of @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , we define a bundle @xmath15 of regular @xmath13-modules over a covering of degree @xmath16 ( @xmath17 being the order of @xmath1 ) of a smooth subset of a poisson - lie group @xmath18 dual to @xmath19 , endowed with an action of an infinite dimensional lie group derived from the quantum coadjoint action of de concini - kac - procesi , originally defined for @xmath13 .",
    "we have ( see theorem [ rmorphism ] , [ equivariant ] and [ reduction ] for precise statements ) :    [ teointro ] the regular @xmath3-symbols of @xmath10 and the matrix dilogarithms coincide and define a bundle morphism @xmath20 equivariant under the quantum coadjoint action .",
    "since the quantum coadjoint action lifts the adjoint action of @xmath8 via an unramifield @xmath21-fold covering @xmath22 of the big cell of @xmath8 , it will follow that @xmath23 descends to a morphism of a vector bundle of rank @xmath16 over a @xmath24-fold covering of the algebraic quotient @xmath5 .",
    "the remarkable dependence of the matrix dilogarithms on cross - ratios of @xmath25-tuples of points on @xmath26 , which was previously known by direct computation and allowed the qhft to be defined on the moduli space of flattened hyperbolic ideal tetrahedra , is a consequence of theorem [ teointro ] .",
    "this alternative description is presented in section [ matdil ] .    in order to achieve our goals we have to review quite a lot of material , starting from the basic properties of @xmath10 ( section [ pbw ] ) , and developing in detail its representation theory and quantum coadjoint action ( section [ modules ] and [ qca ] , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath3-symbols of the color modules of @xmath14 and of the regular modules of @xmath13 are defined in section [ cgo ] .",
    "theorem [ teointro ] is proved in section [ 6jmorph ] . there",
    "we make a crucial use of fundamental results of semenov - tian - shansky @xcite , weinstein - xu @xcite , and lu @xcite on poisson - lie groups and their doubles and quantizations .    there should be no obstruction to extend theorem [ teointro ] to the quantum groups @xmath27 of arbitrary complex simple lie algebras @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding quantum coadjoint action theory is described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recent works of geer and patureau - mirand @xcite show that the qhft setup extends to `` relative homotopy quantum field theories '' , including tqft associated to the categories of finite dimensional weight @xmath27-modules .",
    "a challenging problem is to relate them to the three - dimensional chern - simons theory for flat @xmath28-connections .",
    "finally , let us note that a similar approach can be used to describe `` holonomy '' @xmath29-matrices for the regular @xmath27-modules , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "we will often meet notions from the theory of poisson - lie groups .",
    "the reader will find the needed material in standard textbooks , like @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
