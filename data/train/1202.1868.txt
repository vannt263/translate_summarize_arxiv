    "the mass required to begin rapidly accreting gas is determined by the aspect ratio of the disk , the mass of the star , and the luminosity of the core that is provided by planetesimal accretion and can prevent collapse of the accreting gas . for a solar mass star , a thin disk with an aspect ratio of 0.05 , and a surface density of planetesimals of 10 g@xmath2 at 5au",
    ", the core must be around ten earth masses to begin runaway accretion .",
    "the lifetime of the gas disk is on the order of 10 myr , and the core must form before the disk dissipates .",
    "planetary embryos are massive enough to not be affected by the gas drag forces that dominate the motion of smaller bodies moving through the sub - keplerian gas disk .",
    "the mass of the planetary embryos , however , induces spiral lindblad resonances in the gas disk .",
    "the asymmetry in the size of the inner and outer lindblad resonances generates a net negative torque from the disk that , in the absence of other effects , robs the planet of angular momentum , leading to inward type i migration and ultimately infall into the central star .",
    "a linear treatment of the torque from isothermal gas in the co - rotating region of the planetary embryo shows that it provides a positive torque arising from the presence of a vortensity gradient that nearly offsets the net lindblad torque , but a small net negative torque remains .",
    "the behavior of multiple planetary embryos embedded in a gas disk and undergoing inward migration due to lindblad and linear co - rotational torques was explored by @xcite .",
    "they found that as bodies with different masses migrate inwards , differential migration leads to mergers , forming bodies with masses in the planetary core range .",
    "these simulations use large embryos  with masses of at least 2 @xmath1 and up to planetary core mass  and simulate migration in a laminar , isothermal disk .",
    "in addition to the perturbations to the gas disk caused by the presence of the planetary embryos , a partially ionized disk with a subthermal magnetic field can develop turbulence through the magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the resulting random overdensities in the gas can lead the planetary embryo to undergo a random walk , possibly avoiding infall for some of the bodies @xcite . while this is an effective way to prevent catastrophic infall for planetesimal - sized objects with radii of @xmath3  km @xcite",

    "planetary embryos undergoing inward type  i migration can be trapped in pressure ridges that may form in the presence of a dead - zone boundary or within an anti - cyclonic vortex .",
    "the positive gradient in surface density in these regions leads to formation of a convergence zone , where migration halts .",
    "the dynamics of multiple planetary embryos undergoing type  i migration in the proximity of a pressure ridge convergence zone have been investigated by @xcite , who found that planets collide until only a few remain .",
    "@xcite showed that such pressure traps can lead to growth from planetary embryos to planetary cores through continual generation of bodies that migrate into the pressure ridge convergence zone .",
    "one possible means of avoiding catastrophic infall that could lead to rapid formation of planetary cores was found by @xcite , who explored the interactions of planets with a gas disk , in a model in which they did not make the locally isothermal approximation , but rather directly modeled the effects of radiative transfer through optically thick gas with an adiabatic equation of state .",
    "they found that the co - rotation torque arising from the gas undergoing horseshoe turns near the planet showed a strong positive contribution when the isothermal approximation was relaxed .",
    "this was later shown to be a result of the presence of an entropy gradient across the corotation region @xcite .",
    "a large radial entropy gradient increases the positive co - rotation torque to the point that it cancels out the negative net lindblad torque and can even reverse the direction of migration .",
    "this understanding was developed further in @xcite .",
    "a prescription for the nonlinear horseshoe torque was given by @xcite , allowing the total torque on a planet undergoing type  i migration to be calculated , given the local temperature and surface density gradients .",
    "the migration of a single planet embedded in an evolving disk was then studied by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter lpm10 ) , who found that planets migrate towards convergence zones , where the net torque is zero .",
    "planets located exterior to these orbits experience a negative torque , while planets located interior experience a positive torque . upon reaching the zero - torque region ,",
    "the planets migrate inwards with the disk until the disk dissipates , thus avoiding collision with the star .    in this paper , we extend the work of lpm10 by following the interactions of multiple planets converging towards any zero - torque radius .",
    "we use the disk evolution model from lpm10 , for a non - isothermal one - dimensional disk with photoevaporation and viscous diffusion .",
    "the radial profiles of temperature and surface density from the disk evolution model are used to determine the torque on planetary embryos in an @xmath0-body simulation , following the formula for non - isothermal , unsaturated , horseshoe torque of @xcite .",
    "an optimized version of the bulirsch - stoer @xmath0-body code used in @xcite is employed to integrate the orbits of the planets under the influence of the torque from the gas disk , as well as eccentricity and inclination damping following @xcite .",

    "we stress , though , that the precise nature of the transition has little influence on the results since , as shown in lpm10 , most of the planet evolution in the disk through space and time occurs well within the adiabatic regime .",
    "the resulting torques are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : torqueprof ] .",
    "in addition to the torque that is responsible for type  i migration , the gas disk also imparts a force on a planet that acts to dampen the planet s eccentricity @xmath60 and inclination @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "this dampening can be modeled as an exponential decay .",
    "tanaka and ward ( 2004 ) provide the timescale @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the semi - major axis of the planet , and the disk aspect ratio @xmath37 is given by equation  ( [ eq : aspect ] ) .",

    "small enough planets embedded in a turbulent disk have been shown to undergo random walks , rather than migrate inward in classical type  i migration @xcite .",
    "the random walks can be modeled as a first order markov process @xcite where the root mean squared torque and the autocorrelation time can be calculated up to a constant by dimensional analysis .",
    "however , the correlation function of such a first order markov process over the plane of the disk will be zero for all non - zero distances  so two planets in close proximity may feel completely different forces from this prescription for turbulence .",
    "we use a model developed by @xcite and further modified by @xcite that treats the turbulent force as the gradient of a potential multiplied by a scaling factor . in this model ,",
    "the turbulent force is continuous over the disk and correlated torques act on planets near to each other . due to the chaotic nature of @xmath0-body problems",
    ", turbulence can lead to collisions that would not have occurred otherwise , but during the close encounter of two bodies , the difference between the turbulent forces acting on each body goes to zero , and the relative velocity at collision is close to the velocity for two bodies on the same orbit in the absence of turbulence .",
    "additionally , our results show that neighboring orbits near the convergence zone can be stable when separated by as little as 0.4 au at a distance of 11 au from the central star , so the same turbulent perturbations could affect both orbits .",

    "we justify this by noting that the relaxed mass distribution is nearly independent of the initial mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the various models we ran are shown in table [ table : runs ] .",
    "we detail them in this and in the next section .",
    "first , in our fiducial model ( model h1 in table [ table : runs ] ) , the initial masses of the planetary embryos are all set to 0.75 @xmath1 .",
    "the innermost embryo is placed in a circular orbit with radius @xmath131  au , and each succesive embryo is placed so that neighbors  @xmath61 and  @xmath132 are initially separated by @xmath133 , where the mutual hill radius @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in the fiducial model h1 , we use @xmath136 .",
    "several other runs were performed with varying masses of initial bodies , but maintaining the constraint of spacing consecutive bodies by three mutual hill radii .",
    "these runs are all labeled _ h _ , for `` hill spacing '' , in table [ table : runs ] .",
    "second , we used a gaussian distribution of the initial masses of planet embryos .",
    "this is done by setting the mean mass and standard deviation for the distribution , with a floor of 0.1 @xmath1 and a ceiling of @xmath137 .",
    "these models are labeled _ g _ , for `` gaussian '' , in table [",
    "table : runs ] .",
    "in these runs , the mutual hill radii constraint is still used to determine initial locations , but the number of hill radii between neighboring bodies is varied between runs to model low density and high density populations .",
    "three further simulations are performed with an initial population of bodies resulting from superimposing two low density populations ( models g7g9 ) .",
    "third , we ran initial conditions consisting of two populations of planetary embryos with different masses , to investigate how massive , quickly migrating bodies interact with lower - mass bodies that migrate on much longer timescales .",
    "the low - mass population in this model consists of 25 embryos with a mass of 0.25 @xmath1 separated by 4 mutual hill radii , while the massive population consists of planets with masses of 0.75 or 1.0 @xmath1 separated by either 6 or 10 mutual hill radii .",
    "the two populations are generated independently of one another , so a large and small body may initially be in close proximity to one another .",
    "these models are labeled _ sw _",
    ", for `` swarm '' , in table [ table : runs ] .",
    "fourth , we use an initial configuration that scales with the amount of disk mass within the orbital radius of a planetary embryo . the mass of the planetary embryos is held constant , so the initial spacing between the semimajor axes of neighboring embryos is varied so that the mass of the gas in the annulus separating the two bodies is constant .",
    "assuming that the dust - to - gas ratio in the disk is 0.01 , and planetesimal formation turns @xmath138 of the dust into planetary embryos , then the initial spacing between two neighboring bodies @xmath139 where the numerical factor is the inverse of the product of the dust - to - gas ratio 0.01 and the planet formation efficiency 0.15 .",
    "these models are labeled _ sd _",
    ", for `` surface density '' , in table [ table : runs ] .",
    "one simulation is performed using a gaussian mass distribution , spaced using the sd criteria .",
    "this simulation is included in the sd suite of simulations .    the initial eccentricities and inclinations of planets",
    "are also selected randomly from gaussian distributions .",
    "the inclination is the absolute value of a gaussian distribution with 0 mean and @xmath140 as the standard deviation.the mean value for the initial eccentricity is 0.05 , with a standard deviation of 0.02 .",
    "if the eccentricity is negative , a new value is generated until the value is non - negative .",
    "due to the magnitude of the damping force , initial eccentricities and inclinations are found to be transient and do not play a significant role in the simulations .",
    "the history of the fiducial model ( h1 ) , with 23 bodies each having a mass of 0.75@xmath1 and separated by @xmath141 , is shown in fig .  [ fig : fiducialhistory ] .",
    "initially , the motions of the embryos are dominated by the type  i torque , leading to rapid convergence .",
    "the convergence leads to close encounters between neighboring bodies , resulting in collisions and orbit swapping .",
    "the close encounters and chaotic scattering and collisions persist until the number of remaining planets is small enough to quiescently migrate inwards .",
    "the sharp peaks near 600,000 and 800,000 years are not planets being scattered out to large radii , but rather the result of solving for the orbital elements , assuming the planet is orbiting the central body , when in reality the bodies have formed a transient binary system . such binary systems and satellite capture have been observed in other @xmath0-body simulations that include the effects of a gas disk , such as @xcite .    the fiducial model has a total initial mass of 17.25 @xmath1 in planet embryos . in it , a @xmath142 core forms at the zero - torque orbit in 1.29 myr .",
    "no further collisions happen after this , as the remaining bodies are trapped in mean - motion resonances with the massive planetary core ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] ) .",
    "two @xmath143 bodies are trapped in the 5:6 resonance with the planetary core , and a @xmath144 body is trapped outside the orbit of the planetary core , in a 7:6 resonance with it .",
    "an additional @xmath143 embryo orbits within the co - orbital region of the planetary core as a trojan . other simulations show similar behavior , with accretion eventually being halted by resonance trapping once the planetary core is massive enough .",
    "the fiducial model begins with planetary embryos of 0.75 @xmath1 .",
    "we also simulate disks populated with embryos of 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.25 , and 1.5 @xmath1 separated , as in the fiducial case , by @xmath141 .",
    "these correspond to models h2-h5 in table [ table : runs ] .",
    "given the dependence of the hill radius on the mass of the planet , systems consisting of more massive embryos contain a greater total mass .",
    "since the magnitude of the migration torque , eq . ( [ eq : scale - torque ] ) , varies as the square of the mass of the planet , and thus the acceleration varies linearly with mass , lighter embryos take longer to migrate to the convergence zone .",
    "this , combined with gravitational focusing , explains why the time required to build a core is a strong function of the initial mass of the embryos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : assemblytime ] ) .",
    "the fiducial model built a 10@xmath1 core in 1.28 myr , while the run using 1.0@xmath1 embryos reached a 10@xmath1 core in 0.43 myr .",
    "the runs with 1.25 and 1.5 @xmath1 embryos formed cores in 0.21 and 0.15 myr , respectively .",
    "the 0.5 @xmath1 embryos failed to produce a 10 @xmath1 body , but did form an 8 @xmath1 core after 2.22 myr .    to see",
    "if these results are characteristic of such a mass distribution , identical simulations to the ones above with initial planet masses of 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.25 , and 1.5 @xmath1 are run , though the azimuthal distribution of the planets is varied , and so the chaotic interactions lead to different results .",
    "the dependence of the time required to assemble a massive core does hold for the five runs of each initial mass .",
    "there is , however , a wide upper bound for the time to form a core , so much so that each distribution other than the 1.5 @xmath1 runs ( model h5 ) had one run of the 5 fail to form a 10 @xmath1 core .",
    "these are not plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : assemblytime ] , but the resulting systems were interesting , often consisting of two or more massive bodies coorbiting with one another stably for the rest of the 8 myr simulation .    the formation history of runs h14 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] . the simulations with more massive embryos",
    "are seen to rapidly develop large planets , while the simulations consisting of embryos with initial masses less than @xmath145 remain dispersed after @xmath146  yr . the simulations demonstrate that , while the time required to form a core can vary by over an order of magnitude for embryos whose initial mass differs by a factor of two , the resulting core and the arrangement of the remaining bodies is similar for all the simulations .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : masses ] are representative of the collection of simulations run with these initial conditions",
    ".    runs g19 also suggest that the rate of core formation is highly dependent on the mass of the embryos .",
    "two runs with a mean mass of @xmath147 and a standard deviation of @xmath148 ( g1 and g2 ) built large cores within 0.3 myr .",
    "the initial masses for the two distributions are generated independently , which also varies the radial distribution , since planets are initially separated by @xmath141 .",
    "the core formation history of one of these runs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : randomhistory ] , along with the formation histories of g3 , g5 , and g8 .",
    "the results of these runs suggest that the trend seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : assemblytime ] can be used to estimate the time required to assemble a core from a gaussian mass distribution with a given mean mass .",
    "if the mean of the initial mass distribution is lowered to 0.5@xmath1 ( models g5 and g6 ) the time required to migrate bodies to the convergence zone increases significantly , and when cores are built , they are smaller and take longer to form .",
    "the mass distribution is again gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.2@xmath1 , though there are lower and upper mass limits of 0.1@xmath1 and 2.0@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "two runs were performed , with an independent mass distribution generated for each .",
    "the first run took 2.5 myr to build a 6.9@xmath1 core , and is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : randomhistory ] beside the history of a run composed of only 0.5@xmath1 planetary embryos .",
    "the second run took 3.2 myr to form a 9.3@xmath1 core .",
    "the runs with a population of 0.25@xmath1 bodies interspersed with more massive embryos did not result in the smaller bodies being swept up in collisions with the rapidly migrating large embryos .",
    "instead , the larger embryos scatter the 0.25@xmath1 objects into high eccentricity orbits and continue to migrate towards the convergence zone where mergers between large bodies go on to create cores .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bground ] ( left panel ) by the two characteristic timescales for migration , which , aside from a few brief scattering events , occur more or less independently of one another . following the formation of a core with mass @xmath149 ,",
    "smaller bodies are seen to collide with the core or become trapped as trojans .",
    "many , though , avoid close encounters with the planetary core and continue to interact chaotically with the other remaining small planetary embryos in two swarms , one interior and one exterior to the planetary core .",
    "neglecting the ( substantial ) effect of gas accretion onto the planetary core , the model shows that these swarms eventually merge at later times , as seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bground ] , which depicts the whole 8myr of the simulation . figure  [ fig : historybground ] depicts the evolution of the background swarm of 0.25@xmath1 by themselves ( model sw1 ) as well as three cases where more massive bodies are interspersed into the low mass swarm ( models sw2-sw4 ) .",
    "the mass of the larger bodies , as well as the number of larger bodies , is not seen to have a noticeable effect on the migration and merging of the smaller bodies .",
    "an alternative to determining the initial positions of planetary embryos by requiring them to be a set number of mutual hill radii from their neighbor is to require that the distribution of mass in the form of planets mirror the mass distribution of the gas disk .",
    "this leads to a larger number of planets starting at radii exterior to the zero - torque orbit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdfiducial ] , we compare the history of fiducial run h1 with run sd1 , which differs from the fiducial run only in that the planetary mass is linearly proportional to the mass of gas within an annulus , following eq .",
    "( [ eq : annulus ] ) .    the early period of convergence is skewed to larger radii in the latter , but as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : torqueprof ] , the torque exterior to the convergence zone is of the same magnitude as the torque interior to the convergence zone .",
    "the time to migrate from initial locations to close enough to the convergence zone that @xmath0-body effects take over is not significantly affected by altering the initial radial distribution of planets .",
    "the prescription for type  i migration used in this paper was derived by @xcite using 2d simulations .",
    "those authors noted that the gas dynamics may act differently in 3d .",
    "our simulations assume that the type  i migration torque derived for an isolated body in a non - isothermal disk also applies to many bodies that pass arbitrarily close to one another .",
    "this close proximity may significantly alter the migration torque or lead to a more rapid saturation of the torque .",
    "such proximity is often shortlived , but in the case of a satellite being captured could lead to a change in the torque acting on the pair lasting thousands of years .",
    "a preliminary two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of two bodies migrating in close proximity suggests that the wakes of the planets drive brief periods of large variations in the torque .",
    "this will be explored in future work .",
    "the initial convergence takes place while planets are separated from one another , so using the prescription for the torque on an isolated body is reasonable .",
    "following convergence , close gravitational encounters dominate until a planetary core is formed .",
    "in several simulations , the resulting system had two large bodies that had a combined mass greater than 10@xmath1 but failed to produce a single massive core .",
    "studying such a system in a simulation that accounts for gap opening by the planets in the gas disk could shed light on how such an arrangement will evolve .",
    "@xcite showed that the horseshoe torque is reduced as eccentricity is increased , and shuts down as the radial excursions associated with eccentricity exceed the width of the co - rotation region .",
    "@xcite further showed that outward migration can be sustained for inclinations up to about 4.5@xmath150 , after which migration stalls in general , owing to the lower densities away from the disk midplane .",
    "we assess the effect of eccentricity and inclination in the next section .",
    "in addition , the prescription for the co - rotational torque that we use considers only the unsaturated regime .",
    "we calculate for the parameters used in the present work that the effects of diffusion , explored in @xcite for alpha disks , imply that only larger planets , with masses exceeding @xmath151 , will experience sustained outward migration .",
    "our choice of working with the unsaturated torque stems from the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these works measured the co - rotational torques in turbulent disks , finding that the stochastic turbulent fluctuations work toward keeping the co - rotational torque unsaturated even in locally isothermal simulations . @xcite",
    "have conclusively shown that horseshoe dynamics exists in turbulent disks , and argue that it occurs when the amplitude of the u - turn drift rate exceeds that of the turbulent velocity fluctuations .",
    "this condition may or may not occur for smaller planets , for which the u - turn drift rate is reduced .",
    "unfortunately , neither @xcite nor @xcite could numerically resolve the expected horseshoe region width in this mass range .",
    "we thus recognize saturation for smaller planets as a possibility , but regard the question as unsettled .",
    "our conclusions about resonance trapping neglect the effect of interactions with the wakes of the growing planetary core . these may be sufficiently strong to knock lower - mass bodies out of the resonances that we find .",
    "even if the resonances do remain , our assumption about evolving the gas disk independently of the planets breaks down once the planetary core has reached a mass near 10 @xmath1 . at that point",
    "it begins first to accrete gas , and then , when its hill radius exceeds a disk scale height , to open a gap in the disk .",
    "our models account for neither development , and so should be taken as only qualitatively indicative ( e.g. the right panel in figure  [ fig : bground ] ) after any object reaches this mass .",
    "we note that the actual critical mass necessary for runaway gas accretion is a sensitive function of the luminosity of the forming planet , which is determined by the release of gravitational binding energy of the accreted material  usually assumed to be provided steadily by planetesimals . in our model",
    ", this continuous luminosity is essentially zero , which would lead to a very small critical core mass @xcite .",
    "the energy is instead provided in discrete violent collisions . a model that incorporates a self - consistent treatment of gas accretion and gap formation by a growing planet with envelope luminosity provided by both planetesimal accretion and binary collisions",
    "would be required to fully assess the initial stages of giant planet formation .",
    "the work presented in this paper examines the same regime as that studied by hn12 , which was made public after the initial submission of our work .",
    "although both works deal with the impact of co - rotation torques and convergent migration on the growth of protoplanets , there are differences in the models that are worth highlighting , in order to understand the different results obtained .    first , we discuss the gas evolution model . in the present work we model the gas density by equating the radial velocity with the viscous inflow , the azimuthal velocity with the keplerian value , and solving the resulting diffusion equation in the presence of photoevaporation .",
    "the initial condition for density is set by defining a global value for mass accretion rate and viscosity ( @xmath9 ) value , which in turn define the surface density @xcite .",
    "having defined the density , the disk is assumed to maintain thermal equilibrium between heating by viscous dissipation and cooling via black body radiation in a background radiative field of temperature @xmath21 , according to equation  ( [ eq : temperature ] ) .",
    "in hn12 , the density and temperatures are set as global power - laws ( that may drop well below the physical value of @xmath152  k set by the surrounding molecular cloud , and even below the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ) .",
    "the viscous - photoevaporative evolution of the density is mimicked by an exponential decay with a fixed e - folding time @xmath153 ; the temperature is evolved dynamically assuming thermal diffusion in the radial direction .",
    "next we consider the growth of the protoplanets . while our work concerns the formation of a core of a giant planet in the vicinity of a convergent migration zone via binary collisions , hn12 attempt a more comprehensive approach .",
    "in addition to collisions with planets of terrestrial size , their protoplanets also accrete from a disk of 10 km planetesimals subject to stokes drag .",
    "they also include an approximate scheme for gas accretion based on fits to the fast 1d giant planet formation model of @xcite . in their model ,",
    "gas capture is a function only of core mass and time , starting at roughly 3   @xmath154 , with runaway gas accretion setting in at 30  @xmath154 .",
    "the gas accretion is artificially cut off at either the jovian mass or at the gas isolation mass , whichever is lower .",
    "a minor difference between our work and hn12 lies in the inclination and eccentricity damping .",
    "both works use prescriptions that are based on the analytical formulae derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hn12 use the same inclination damping , but a smoother version for eccentricity damping .",
    "we use the model of @xcite that improves on @xcite by including empirical fits to the transition from exponential to quadratic damping at higher eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "finally we consider the prescription for migration of the protoplanets .",
    "hn12 model saturation effects , while we chose to work with the fully unsaturated torque , as explained in the previous subsection .",
    "another major difference is our inclusion of stochastic migration @xcite caused by the inclusion of turbulent jitter ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : turbulence ] ) .    as a result",
    ", hn12 find a bimodal formation process .",
    "cores that grow too massive too fast migrate into the star , whereas cores of moderate mass slowly migrate outward to large distances , accreting gas and becoming giant planets at wide orbits , mostly beyond 10au .",
    "super - earths or neptune - mass planets were not easily formed .",
    "the difference in the results that we find are readily understood in terms of these differences in the modeling .",
    "first , without a background radiation field of temperature @xmath21 below which the disk can not cool , the model of hn12 lacks the transition to isothermality that gives rise to a limit of outward migration in our models , usually between 1020au , depending on the initial parameters used .",
    "second , their inclusion of saturation in hn12 introduces a mass - dependency to both the location and existence of convergence zones .",
    "rapid inward migration occurs for planets outside of a narrow range in mass .",
    "lastly , our inclusion of turbulent jitter dynamically excites the resonant convoy , leading to more gravitational interaction than seen in hn12 , and faster core growth .",
    "these differences highlight the fact that planet migration and growth depend very sensitively on the disk model adopted .",
    "in two out of their suite of forty simulations , hn12 apply a eccentricity cutoff to the co - rotational torque , taking in to account the findings of @xcite .",
    "they find that the eccentricity excursions of the protoplanets easily exceed the threshold of @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the dimensionless half - width of the co - rotational zone , therefore quenching the co - rotational torques .",
    "we measure @xmath157 in four of our models .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eccentricities ] .",
    "we see that the eccentricies excited by the n - body interactions and the turbulent jitter on the protoplanets far exceeds the stringent threshold of @xmath155 , confirming the result of hn12 .",
    "however , the same processes that account for eccentricity pumping should also lead to inclination growth . as shown by @xcite , migration stalls in general when the inclination rises above a threshold @xmath158 .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : inclinations ] @xmath69 for the same models as in fig .",
    "[ fig : eccentricities ] .",
    "a comparison of the two figures suggests that eccentricity and inclination are indeed correlated . the aspect ratio being @xmath159 , we have @xmath160 .",
    "figure  [ fig : inclinations ] shows that the inclinations grow well beyond this modest threshold .",
    "this indicates that although the high eccentricities would lead to a shutdown of the co - rotational torques and resuming of fast inward migration , the associated high inclinations would mitigate the effect by also shutting down the lindblad torque and , consequently , migration in general .",
    "we have studied the evolution of multiple planets migrating in a non - isothermal gas disk , assuming unsaturated migration torques @xcite .",
    "initially , the planets migrate towards the convergence zone as was described by lpm10 for individual planets in such a disk .",
    "once the planets are near the convergence zone , however , the close proximity to other planets leads to chaotic interactions and collisions , eventually resulting in the formation of several large bodies that often merge to form a single massive planetary core .",
    "the planetary core dominates the dynamics of the remnant bodies , and the smaller bodies tend to get trapped in mean - motion resonances with the core .",
    "some become trapped as trojans with the core , and the whole system migrates inward on the viscous timescale as the disk evolves , maintaining the resonances . as the goal of this investigation was to study planetary embryos undergoing type  i migration , the simulation does not model accretion onto the planetary core or type  ii migration . both should be treated in future work .",
    "since the migration torque scales with the mass of the planet , simulations that initially consist of larger mass planetary embryos produce planetary cores rapidly , while simulations that start with less massive bodies often take more than 1  myr to form a core . the rate of core formation does not appear to depend on the initial distribution of planets in the disk , but does depend on the mass of the planetary embryos that coalesce to form the core .",
    "a realistic protoplanetary disk would consist of planetary embryos with a range of masses , but we have shown that even in the case of a gaussian distribution of embryo masses the trend of large embryos migrating faster and merging earlier holds .",
    "the location of the convergence zone is determined by the temperature profile of the gas disk .",
    "this , in turn , is determined by the turbulent viscosity as parameterized by @xmath9 , the total disk mass , and background illumination from the central star and neighboring stars .",
    "the convergence zone falls at larger radii for larger values of @xmath9 and the disk temperature .",
    "more massive stars have hotter disks , leading to convergence zones at larger radii .",
    "direct imaging has indeed revealed a population of giant planets at radii of order 100  au ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) around stars significantly more massive than the sun .",
    "our results offer a possible means of building gas giant planets via fast core accretion at such large radii .",

    "<S> the torques exerted by a locally isothermal disk on an embedded planet lead to rapid inward migration . </S>",
    "<S> recent work has shown that modeling the thermodynamics without the assumption of local isothermality reveals regions where the net torque on an embedded planet is positive , leading to outward migration of the planet . </S>",
    "<S> when a region with negative torque lies directly exterior to this , planets in the inner region migrate outwards and planets in the outer region migrate inwards , converging where the torque is zero . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate the torques from an evolving non - isothermal disk into an @xmath0-body simulation to examine the behavior of planets or planetary embryos interacting in the convergence zone . </S>",
    "<S> we find that mutual interactions do not eject objects from the convergence zone . </S>",
    "<S> small numbers of objects in a laminar disk settle into near resonant orbits that remain stable over the 10 myr periods that we examine . </S>",
    "<S> however , either or both increasing the number of planets or including a correlated , stochastic force to represent turbulence drives orbit crossings and mergers in the convergence zone . </S>",
    "<S> these processes can build gas giant cores with masses of order ten earth masses from sub - earth mass embryos in 23 myr . </S>"
