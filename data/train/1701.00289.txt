    "the republic of ireland held a referendum to legalise same - sex marriage on the @xmath0 of may @xmath1 .",
    "this referendum saw a high turnout ( 60.52% of voters ) , and the final result was a 62% majority in favour of the legalisation of same - sex marriage .",
    "such high turnout represented a dramatic increase compared to previous referenda  @xcite .",
    "the enthusiasm of the electorate was reflected in the activity of on - line social media platforms , particularly on twitter which saw a wealth of activity in the days preceding the referendum  @xcite .",
    "twitter is an online micro - blogging platform where users can post short messages or _",
    "tweets _ that can be up to 140 characters long ; in ireland , an estimated @xmath2% of adults have a twitter account , of which @xmath3 use the service every day  @xcite .",
    "users can subscribe to other users tweets ( or _ follow _ ) ; such following relationships are often asymmetric , if one user follows another , a reciprocated following relationship does not always exist  @xcite .",
    "in addition to following each other , there are other ways in which users can publicly interact such as _ re - tweeting _ ( passing forward another user s tweet ) , and mentioning each other in tweets .",
    "twitter has been a popular venue for the dissemination of information , memes , opinions , and has facilitated public debate about a variety of subjects  @xcite . as a result , twitter has received considerable attention from researchers who wish to gain insights into the relationships and mechanisms that govern these social interactions  @xcite .    the use of sentiment analysis to infer the disposition of individuals or groups towards specific topics is a growing area of interest in computational social science  @xcite .",
    "for example , sentiment analysis on twitter data has been used to study stock market fluctuations  @xcite , film box - office performance  @xcite and reviews  @xcite , tracking the spread of influenza  @xcite , and ( albeit controversially ) predicting elections  @xcite .",
    "although some of these studies have well - noted shortcomings  @xcite , the idea of using the content of tweets to gain insight into social phenomena remains a promising and compelling one .",
    "recent studies , using carefully constructed methodologies , have successfully leveraged sentiment to uncover insights into its effect on the spreading of cascades on twitter  @xcite , and how top broadcasters send messages with positive sentiment more often than negative  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we combine analyses of sentiment and social structure to explore twitter conversations about the irish marriage referendum .",
    "in particular , we address the following questions :    * how did users interact with each other on twitter in the context of the irish marriage referendum ? * can user interactions and the sentiment of their tweets help us find supporters of voting _ yes _ ( in favour of the legalisation of same - sex marriage ) and _ no _ ( against it ) ?    to answer these questions , we analyse an extensive dataset of tweets about the referendum , and the interactions among the users who posted the tweets ( sec .  [ sec : datacollection ] ) .",
    "we extract a sentiment score for each tweet ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sentimentanalysis ] ) , and incorporate it into the structure of the mention and follower networks of users ( sec .",
    "[ sec : networkconstruction ] ) .",
    "these networks enable the analysis of how the sentiment of users is correlated , and the proclivity of users with positive / negative sentiment to cluster together ( sec .",
    "[ sec : testingrel ] ) .",
    "we use community detection to partition the users in the mention and follower networks into groups who communicate more or are generally more interested in each other s content .",
    "we examine these communities from the vantage point of sentiment analysis to find a parsimonious three - group partition of the users ( sec .",
    "[ sec : communitydetection ] ) .",
    "these three groups are broadly composed of _ yes _ and _ no _ supporters with varying levels of activity , and starkly different patterns of interaction with each other ( sec .",
    "[ sec : classaccuracy ] ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss our results and explore potential future research directions .",
    "minute bins .",
    "the volume of tweets increases over time with the notable spikes for the two televised debates and the referendum day .",
    "( b ) complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) for number of tweets per user on a log - log scale ( inset : the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the same data).,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the dataset we use in this work consists of _ every _ tweet containing the hashtags # marref and # marriageref from may 8 to may 23 @xmath1 ( one day after the referendum ) . in total",
    "we collected 499,642 tweets posted by 144,007 unique users ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tweetdist](a ) ) .",
    "a total of 204,626 tweets were posted before the referendum day ; 88,320 on the day ; and 206,696 after .",
    "the peaks observed in fig .  [ fig : tweetdist](a ) coincide with the first and second televised debates ( held on may @xmath4 and may @xmath5 ) and the referendum day ( may @xmath0 ) , the tallying and announcement of the results , and subsequent global reaction .",
    "figure  [ fig : tweetdist](b ) shows that the number of tweets per user has a heavy tailed distribution .",
    "the vast majority of users only posted a small number of tweets with the tracked hashtags , while a small number of users are responsible for a large volume of tweets .",
    "of the total number of tweets , 135,370 ( @xmath6 ) were _ original _ , 24,397 ( @xmath7 ) were _ replies _ and 339,875 ( @xmath8 ) were _",
    "retweets_. broadly speaking , original tweets are messages that are not in response to another previously posted tweet ( i.e. , the content is ` new ' ) , replies are tweets that are posted in response to an existing original tweet , and retweets are tweets written by others that a user passes along to his / her followers . in addition users",
    "can _ mention _ each other in their tweets by inserting a user s screen name ( technically , replies and retweets can be seen as specific types of mention tweets ) . in our data",
    "there are 388,161 mention tweets ( @xmath9 of all tweets ) , of which 25,732 are original , 23,131 are replies , and 339,298 are retweets .",
    "in addition to tweets , we also obtained the follower relationships of all users who tweeted one of the hashtags in our data ( i.e. , a list of everyone who is followed by the authors of the tweets in our data , regardless of whether they used the tracked hashtags ) .",
    "these correspond to 117,669,550 follower links .",
    "we also collected user information such as self - defined location , self - description and how long the user has been a member of twitter .",
    "all data was collected by sinnia using twitter gnip power - track api which returns a complete dataset , not just a sample  @xcite . using the twitter stream api has the limitation that as the popularity of a search term ( e.g. , a hashtag ) increases , the representativeness of the sample decreases  @xcite . by extracting _",
    "all _ tweets with the two hashtags , and all user following relationships we are able to circumvent such sampling issues",
    ". there could be , however , other issues with the data . for example , it is possible that our data gathering could miss important tweets or individuals if they never tweeted using one of the tracked hashtags .",
    "however , due to the ubiquity of the hashtags # marref and # marriageref in the weeks leading up to the referendum we are confident that our data is an adequate representation of the twitter discourse about the topic .",
    "to quantify how positive or negative a tweet is , we need to compute the tweet s sentiment score .",
    "we do not consider sentiment with the categorical _ positive _ or _ negative _ labels ; instead we consider sentiment to be a number whose magnitude denotes how positive or negative the language expressed is  @xcite . for this task",
    "we use the open source sentiment algorithm _ sentistrength _ , a lexicon - based sentiment algorithm that searches for words that have an associated positive or negative score  @xcite .",
    "sentistrength provides a score of both the positive _ and _ the negative emotional charge of a string of text ( in this case , of each tweet in our data ) .",
    "positive scores range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and negative scores from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "a score of @xmath10 ( or @xmath12 ) indicates that the tweet has no positive ( or negative sentiment ) , while a score of @xmath11 ( or @xmath13 ) means that the tweet has the most positive ( negative ) score possible .",
    "see appendix  [ app : sentiexample ] for more details on how sentiment scores are obtained with sentistrength .        figure  [ fig : sen_diff_scores](a ) shows the two dimensional distribution of sentiment scores of all the tweets in our dataset . to simplify calculations",
    "we compute the difference between the positive and negative scores of each tweet to obtain a one dimensional score between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a negative score indicates that the tweet contains stronger negative language than positive , and vice versa for positive scores .",
    "figure  [ fig : sen_diff_scores](b ) shows the distribution of the unidimensional sentiment scores of all tweets in the dataset . about half of all tweets ( @xmath16 ) have a score of zero ; of these the vast majority ( @xmath17 ) have a score of @xmath10 and @xmath12 for positive and negative language , respectively ( i.e. , no detected sentiment ) , and the rest have balanced positive and negative sentiment scores . the distribution is roughly symmetric about zero with a slight positive skew ; this observation is consistent with previous reports of sentiment bias in language  @xcite and tweets  @xcite . as noted in the appendix  [ app : sentiexample ] , the sentistrength scores of a single tweet can be unreliable , so a single tweet does not provide definitive information about the user s sentiment . to obtain a more robust indication of users sentiment ,",
    "we can aggregate the scores of all the tweets produced by one user to obtain a single score .",
    "although aggregate scores can help overcome some issues , computing a single score per author neglects the fact that twitter users often interact with multiple people , and that the sentiment of these interactions may vary substantially depending on the counterpart and the nature of the exchange .",
    "therefore using exclusively a single score per user can lead to information loss , and provide a misleading indication about the user s sentiment . to avoid these problems",
    "it is necessary to incorporate the users interactions into our analysis .",
    "although sentistrength has been reported to preform well on twitter datasets  @xcite , the nuances and complexities of human language ( for example sarcasm , idioms , negation , double negatives , and a cavalier attitude towards grammar ) make the process of automatically extracting sentiment a challenging task .",
    "in addition , twitter users do not exist in isolation , they interact with each other through mentions , replies and friend / follower relationships .",
    "for this reason it is necessary to incorporate social structure to obtain a more robust description of the user s disposition with regards to the marriage referendum .",
    "we focus our analysis on two types of twitter networks :    1 .",
    "reciprocal mention network : in this network connections exist between users who have mentioned each other in tweets containing the tracked hashtags .",
    "reciprocal follower network : connections exist between users who _ follow _ each other on twitter .",
    "the information contained in these networks reflects complementary aspects of the interactions between users : the reciprocated mention network includes interactions that arise _ specifically _ from conversations about the irish marriage referendum , and are constrained to the observation period ( @xmath18 to @xmath19 of may ) .",
    "we are interested in studying reciprocal mentions because they are a sign of genuine interactions between users  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the follower network is not constrained to discussions about the marriage referendum , nor to the observation period ; this network provides a broader view of how users are interested in each other .",
    "table  [ tab : netsummary ] provides a summary of statistics for both networks .",
    "we construct the directed mention network by searching each users tweets for mentions of other users ( indicated by a prefixed ` @ ' ) .",
    "a mention often indicates that the author wishes to draw the attention of another user to the content of the tweet ; this could be original content directed at a user , a retweet , or a reply .",
    "the announcement of the referendum results received widespread international attention , which translated into a large number of tweets from users outside of ireland ( see fig.[fig : tweetdist](a ) ) .",
    "we are specifically interested in detecting _",
    "yes _ and _",
    "no _ supporters , which is why we further refine our networks to only include tweets generated before the day of the referendum .",
    "each mention creates a directed connection from the author of the tweet to the user who has been mentioned .",
    "we can incorporate sentiment into this network by setting the weight of the connection to be the sentiment score of the tweet .",
    "when there are multiple directed mentions , we average their sentiment scores .",
    "the resulting network is directed , weighted and signed ( negative weights indicate when the mentions have a predominantly negative sentiment ) ; it contains @xmath20 unique users , and @xmath21 directed connections .",
    "note that the users who appear in this network may not have used one of the tracked hashtags , they only need to have been mentioned in a tweet containing one of the hashtags .",
    "the average combined in and out degree is @xmath4 , with a transitivity coefficient of @xmath22 .",
    "the _ reciprocal mentions network _ is the subnetwork in which connected individuals have mentioned each other in their tweets .",
    "this network has @xmath23 edges ( @xmath24 of the mentions in the full network ) , and @xmath25 users with non - zero in- and out - degree .    to construct the follower network",
    "we obtain the following relationships between users who authored the tweets in our dataset .",
    "this network has @xmath26 users with @xmath27 connections , of which @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are reciprocal .",
    "the average combined in- and out - degree is @xmath30 and the transitivity coefficient is @xmath31 .",
    "the full follower network has a different size to the full mention network because the latter networks starting point was the users who have authored at least one of the tweets in our database .",
    "of the @xmath25 users in the reciprocal mention network @xmath32 are in the largest connected component , of these users @xmath33 users are in the largest connected component of the follower network . the final mention and follower networks contain the users in this @xmath33 node set with @xmath34 and @xmath35 connections , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : netsummary ] contains the summary statistics for the networks .",
    ".summary statistics for the mention and follower networks .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     we can calculate the overall and balanced accuracy for _ yes _ and _ no _ supporters using table  [ tab : conf_yesno ] . the overall accuracy is the ratio of `` true yes '' and `` true no '' supporters ( @xmath36 and @xmath19 , respectively ) to the total number of users in the sample ( @xmath37 ) . the overall accuracy for the sample is @xmath38 .",
    "however , overall accuracy is known to be biased towards more frequent classes . to correct for this bias",
    "we calculate the balanced accuracy  @xcite by calculating the fraction of correctly classified _ yes _ or _ no _ supporters out of the total number of actual supporters and averaging the two ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ) .",
    "the balanced accuracy is then ( @xmath41 ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : classaccuracy ] we labelled the community clusters in terms of both the dominant user leaning and activity levels .",
    "we defined @xmath42 as the _ passive yes _ community cluster , @xmath43 the _ active yes _ , and @xmath44 the _ active no _ community cluster . in an ideal setting , we would report the balanced accuracy for the three types of users . in practice , however , it is a difficult and subjective exercise to discern _ passive yes _ from _ active yes _ users at an individual level . the distinction between passive and active is based on the average user s activity ( number of tweets ) in each community cluster shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsaveragetpu](a )",
    ". therefore , a balanced accuracy for both voter classification and activity is not viable . if we were to make a distinction between @xmath42 and @xmath43 the balanced accuracy would be @xmath45 , treating @xmath42 and @xmath43 separately .",
    "and upper @xmath17 quantiles of the randomised distribution .",
    "a red square indicates the observed fraction falls inside the lower @xmath7 and upper @xmath17 quantiles of the randomised distribution.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    in sec .",
    "[ sec : testingrel ] we showed that the sentiment of users in - neighbourhoods is positively correlated ( in agreement with previous reports  @xcite ) in both the mention and follower network ; this allows us to use it as a proxy for homophily .",
    "we arrived at this result by showing that users with similar sentiment , in particular positive users , were connected more often then we would have expected by random chance .",
    "these results are robust to how we group these users by sentiment . in sec .",
    "[ sec : testingrel ] we applied a coarse labelling of users according to their sentiment score ( `` positive '' , `` negative '' or `` unknown '' ) .",
    "here we show that a finer labelling of users also produces similar results .",
    "we test three alternative ways of labelling users :    1",
    ".   divide users into groups in which the out - sentiment is below ( @xmath46 ) and above ( @xmath47 ) the mean .",
    "2 .   divide users into groups in which the out - sentiment is below ( @xmath48 ) and above ( @xmath49 ) the median .",
    "3 .   divide users into groups by the out - sentiment quartiles ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) .",
    "we then randomise the network with these labels in the same way as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : testingrel ] . figure  [ fig : robustres ] shows the results from the new randomisation tests , which are consistent with our results in sec .  [ sec : testingrel ] of the main text .",
    "the similarity observed between fig .",
    "[ fig : robustres](a )  and  ( b ) is due to the fact that the mean and median of the out sentiment distribution are close . in both cases users above the mean and median tend to be connected more than we would have expected by chance .",
    "figure  [ fig : robustres](c ) tells a similar story , where users in the top two quartiles are more likely to be connected with each other than what we would expect by chance .",
