    "accretion discs in central regions of active galactic nuclei are subject to strong external illumination originating from some kind of corona and giving rise to specific spectral features in the x - ray band .",
    "in particular , the k - shell lines of iron are found to be prominent around @xmath0@xmath1  kev .",
    "it has been shown that the shape of the intrinsic spectra must be further modified by the strong gravitational field of the central mass , and so x - ray spectroscopy could allow us to explore the innermost regions of accretion flows near supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "similar mechanisms operate also in some galactic black - hole candidates .",
    "recent _ xmm - newton _ observations indicate the rather surprising result that relativistic iron lines are not as common as previously believed ; see bianchi et al .",
    "@xcite and yaqoob et al .",
    "@xcite fort further references .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the iron line is not produced in the innermost regions of accretion discs but the situation is likely to be more complex than in simple , steady scenarios .",
    "some evidence for the line emission arising from orbiting spots is present in the time - resolved spectra of a few agns @xcite .",
    "even when clearly observed , relativistic lines behave differently than expected .",
    "the best example is the puzzling lack of correlation between the line and continuum emission in mcg6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , unexpected because the very broad line profile clearly indicates that the line originates in the innermost regions of the accretion disc , hence very close to the illuminating source .",
    "miniutti et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a solution to this problem in terms of an illuminating source moving along the black - hole rotation axis or very close to it .",
    "polarimetric studies along with time - resolved spectroscopy could provide additional information about accretion discs in the strong gravity regime , and this may be essential to discriminate between different possible geometries of the source .",
    "the idea of using polarimetry to gain additional information about accreting compact objects is not a new one .    in this context",
    "it was proposed by rees @xcite that polarized x - rays are of high relevance .",
    "pozdnyakov et al .",
    "@xcite studied spectral profiles of iron x - ray lines that result from multiple compton scattering .",
    "various influences affecting polarization ( due to magnetic fields , absorption as well as strong gravity ) were examined for black - hole accretion discs @xcite .",
    "temporal variations of polarization were also discussed , in particular the case of orbiting spots near a black hole @xcite .",
    "furthermore , within general relativity framework the polarization has been studied by various authors : see portsmouth & bertschinger @xcite for a very recent discussion",
    ". with the promise of new polarimetric detectors @xcite , quantitative examination of specific models becomes timely .",
    "we have developed a new code for time - dependent analysis of relativistic spectral features originating in black - hole accretion discs @xcite .",
    "detailed tracking of time - dependent spectral features ( time - scale of several kiloseconds ) would be particularly relevant for the modelling and interpretation of variable x - ray features .",
    "these have been reported in a growing number of active galactic nuclei and tentatively interpreted in terms of reflection iron lines due to flares and spots @xcite .",
    "narrow fluctuating profiles are often redshifted with respect to the rest energy and they may provide a powerful tool to measure the mass of central black holes in agns and galactic black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "since the reflecting medium has a disc - like geometry , a substantial amount of linear polarization is expected in the resulting spectrum because of compton scattering .",
    "polarization properties of the disc emission are modified by the photon propagation in a gravitational field , providing additional information on its structure . here",
    "we calculate the observed polarization of the reflected radiation assuming the lamp - post model for the stationary power - law illuminating source @xcite .",
    "we assumed a rotating ( kerr ) black hole as the only source of the gravitational field , having a common symmetry axis with an accretion disc .",
    "the disc was also assumed to be stationary and we restricted ourselves to the time - averaged analysis ( we assumed processes that vary at a much slower pace than the light - crossing time at the corresponding radius ) .",
    "the intrinsic polarization of emerging light was computed locally , assuming a plane - parallel scattering layer which was illuminated by light radiated from the primary source .",
    "the reflection component has been computed by a monte - carlo code .",
    "the number of reflected photons is proportional to the incident flux @xmath2 arriving from the primary source , @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents an isotropic and steady power - law primary emission that is emitted into the solid angle @xmath5 and eventually illuminates the local area element @xmath6 on the disc ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed description of computations and for notation ) .",
    "four stokes parameters , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , entirely describe polarization properties of the scattered light .",
    "one has to distinguish the quantities that are determined locally at the point of emission on the disc surface ( index ` loc ' ) and those relevant to a distant observer ( ` o ' ) .",
    "we introduce specific stokes parameters , @xmath11 and then specific stokes parameters per energy bin , i.e.  @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the latter quantities are directly measurable , specifying the fluxes of photons with a given polarization .",
    "one can write @xmath16\\,f\\ , , \\\\   \\label{s3 }   { \\delta}u_{\\rm{}o}(e,\\delta e ) & = & n_0\\int{\\rm{}d}s\\,\\int{\\rm{}d}e_{\\rm{}loc}\\ ,   \\big[q_{\\rm{}loc}(e_{\\rm{}loc})\\sin{2\\psi } \\nonumber \\\\   & & + u_{\\rm{}loc}(e_{\\rm{}loc})\\cos{2\\psi}\\big]\\,f\\ , , \\\\    \\label{s4 }    { \\delta}v_{\\rm{}o}(e,\\delta e ) & = & n_0\\int{\\rm{}d}s\\,\\int{\\rm{}d}e_{\\rm{}loc}\\ ,    v_{\\rm{}loc}(e_{\\rm{}loc})\\,f\\ , ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the transfer function , @xmath18 being the total energy shift between observed and emitted photons , @xmath19 the lensing effect , @xmath20 the cosine of the emission angle , and @xmath21 the angle by which a vector rotates while it is parallelly transported along the light geodesic .    in figures [ pol ] and [ pol1 ]",
    "we show , respectively , the energy dependence of polarization angle and polarization degree due to reflected and reflected plus direct radiation .",
    "one can see that the polarization of reflected radiation can be as high as thirty percent for small inclinations and small heights of the primary source .",
    "polarization of the reflected radiation depends only weakly on energy , except for the region close to the iron edge at @xmath22kev . in order to compute observable characteristics",
    "one has to combine the primary power - law continuum with the reflected component .",
    "the polarization degree of the resulting signal depends on the ratio between the two components and also on the energy range of an observation .",
    "the overall degree of polarization increases with energy ( see bottom panels in figs .",
    "[ pol][pol1 ] ) due to the fact that the intensity of radiation from the primary source diminishes , the intensity of the reflected radiation increases with energy ( in the energy range @xmath23kev ) and the polarization of the reflected light alone stays roughly constant .    in our computations we assumed that the irradiating source emits isotropically and",
    "its light is affected only by gravitational redshift and lensing , according to the source location at @xmath24 on axis .",
    "this results in a dilution of primary light by factor @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is square of the redshift of primary photons reaching directly the observer , @xmath27 is the corresponding lensing factor . here , the redshift is the dominant relativistic term , while lensing of primary photons is a few percent at most and can be safely ignored .",
    "anisotropy of primary radiation may further attenuate or amplify the polarization degree of the final signal , while the polarization angle is almost independent of this influence as long as the primary light is itself unpolarized .    the polarization of scattered light is also shown in fig .  [ poldeg ] , where we plot the polarization degree and the change of the polarization angle as functions of @xmath28 .",
    "notice that in the newtonian case only polarization angles of @xmath29 or @xmath30 would be expected for reasons of symmetry .",
    "the change in angle is due to gravitation for which we assumed a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "the two panels of this figure correspond to different locations of the inner disc edge : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the curves are strongly sensitive to @xmath33 and @xmath28 , while the dependence on @xmath34 is weak for a large disc ( here @xmath35 ) .",
    "sensitivity to @xmath33 is particularly appealing if one remembers practical difficulties in estimating @xmath33 by fitting spectra .",
    "the effect is clearly visible even for @xmath36 .",
    "graphs corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath37 resemble the non - rotating case ( @xmath38 ) quite closely because dragging effects are most prominent near horizon .",
    "figure  [ polangle1 ] shows the polarization degree and angle as functions of the observer s inclination .",
    "again , by comparing the two cases of different @xmath33 one can clearly recognize that the polarization is sensitive to details of the flow near the inner disc boundary .",
    "finally , dependence of the polarization degree of overall radiation ( primary plus reflected ) on the height of the primary source and the observer inclination in different energy ranges is shown in figures [ poldeg1][poldeg2 ] .",
    "we examined strong - gravity polarization features in x - rays reflected from accretion discs . in order to compute directly observable characteristics",
    "one has to combine the primary continuum with the reflected component .",
    "polarization degree of the resulting signal depends on mutual proportion of the two components and the energy range of observation .",
    "polarization properties represent the scattering mechanism , source geometry as well as the gravitational field structure acting on reflected photons .",
    "new generation photoelectric polarimeters in the focal plane of large area optics , such as those foreseen for _ xeus _ , can probe polarization degree of the order of one percent in bright agn , making polarimetry , along with timing and spectroscopy , a tool for exploring the properties of the accretion flows in the vicinity of black holes .",
