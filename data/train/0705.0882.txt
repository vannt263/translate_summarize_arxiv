    "according to the modern viewpoint , the standard quantum field theory model of elementary particles is a low - energy approximation of a certain more fundamental theory which unites in some way all known types of physical interactions together . as a consequence there must exist ( and , in spite of their extreme subtleness ,",
    "be observable ) specific effects , which are not inherent in the standard model and which reveal some features of the underlying more profound theory .",
    "in particular , the lorentz and cpt - symmetry breaking may be expected to occur for physical particles , caused by some dynamic reasons lying outside the standard model .",
    "the theoretical framework , which covers the standard model and includes phenomenological description of lorentz invariance violation in a rather general form , is known as the standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "the emergence of the sme yielded intense theoretical investigation and discussion of its implications for particle physics @xcite , @xcite . among new phenomena predicted and already partially available for high - precision observations , one can mention the following : `` distortion '' of energy - momentum relations of physical particles , effective anisotropy and dispersion of the vacuum ( due to the nature of the sme , this effect is inevitably present in almost all situations considered ) ; non - trivial differences in properties of particles and antiparticles , and particles with different helicities , additional anomalous magnetic moments @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; possible new channels of high - energy reactions ( for instance , processes like @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xcite ) ; specific asymmetry of angular distributions of radiation and reaction products ( an example of this kind is shown in the present work ) ; effects at finite temperature @xcite ; various astrophysical manifestations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; etc . in the present work",
    ", we shall actually consider a very particular limit of the sme related to the minimal lorentz and cpt - symmetry breaking in the electron sector of the theory ( the reasons for making this approximation are discussed further in the paper in more detail ) ; it is described by means of the additional ( to the standard fermion lagrangian ) term @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a pseudovector quantity independent of the space - time coordinates @xmath4 in every fixed reference frame , regarded as a vacuum expectation value of some object of a more fundamental theory .",
    "we shall study the synchrotron radiation of a high - energy electron supposing ( in the same way as it was done in @xcite ) that @xmath5 ; such assumption does not contradict most of the estimates available at present ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so we consider the interaction of the fermion field @xmath6 with the condensate @xmath3 as the only type of lorentz invariance violation present in our theory , neglecting other possible types ( in particular , referring to the photon sector ) .",
    "in contrast to the earlier publications on the similar subject , where only classical approach was adopted ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite ) , we shall carry out consistent quantum consideration of the phenomena , including _ both _ the motion of an electron _ and _ its radiation .",
    "we take lorentz invariance violation into account exactly , i.e. avoiding ( at the stage of quantization ) the perturbation theory approximation and considering @xmath7 as a given classical external field in addition to the magnetic field background .",
    "we obtain a system of exact solutions of the modified dirac equation for an electron with a vacuum magnetic moment in a constant magnetic field , which is necessary for the quantum description of the fermion field in the furry picture @xcite . employing the methods of qed , with the use of these solutions",
    ", we calculate the asymptotic expressions for the spectral - angular distribution of the electromagnetic radiation in the weak - field limit which incorporate yet _ all _ the quantum corrections arising , and we pay special attention to the radiation properties caused by the lorentz invariance violation assumed in the theory .    throughout the work , the natural units @xmath8 are adopted .",
    "in this section , let us recall some of the sme principles and consider the issues related to a high - energy electron handled within this framework .",
    "the lagrangian of the sme is obtained as the most general one describing the possible lorentz non - invariant interactions and consistent with the fundamental principles of the modern quantum field theory ( such as gauge invariance and power - counting renormalizability ) @xcite .",
    "it is believed that these interactions are due to the spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking in the underlying theory , and this imposes the requirement that the corresponding lagrangian terms are lorentz scalars .",
    "consequently , in the low - energy limit , there emerges the extended quantum electrodynamics from the lepton - gauge sector of the sme .",
    "its lagrangian can be written in the following general form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the well - known qed lagrangian : @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the terms describing the lorentz non - invariant interactions in the electron and the photon sector of the theory respectively .",
    "they can be decomposed into the sum of the cpt - even and odd parts :    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    the dimensionless coefficients @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 with dimensions of mass are the tensor parameters independent of the space - time coordinates @xmath4 , encoding the information relevant to the lorentz invariance violation for physical particles in any given reference frame ( for further details see @xcite , @xcite and other reviews of the sme ) .    at present , most of the coefficients describing lorentz invariance violation in the extended qed have been tightly constrained from the existing experimental data , including that of the experiments aimed at the search of the essentially new phenomena mentioned in the introduction @xcite .",
    "the bounds available have different order of magnitude for different sets and combinations of the coefficients ( it is implied , of course , that the quantities with the same dimensionality are being compared ) , and it turns out that there still exists at least one relatively loosely constrained parameter of dimensions of mass . considering the cpt - odd fermion lagrangian term @xmath2 , one may argue @xcite that the upper bound on the timelike component of @xmath23 may be @xmath25 , while for the spacelike components one has @xmath26 or even stronger , and the remaining tensor coefficients are also estimated to be smaller than the upper bound on @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this makes it reasonable to study the effects caused by the non - zero parameter @xmath7 in the first place since it could actually be the greatest one among the others ( with the same dimensions ) .",
    "one of the aims of our investigation is to examine the consequences of this situation for the synchrotron radiation and to place bounds on @xmath7 possibly more stringent than those available in the literature .    at the same time",
    ", one may argue that the dimensionless coefficients ( that are present in the kinetic - like terms of ( [ theory_l_even_lepton])([theory_l_odd_photon ] ) ) do not actually play a dominant role when considering any high - energy processes unless going into the planck - scale physics ( this differs significantly from the viewpoint accepted in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it is believed that the scale that governs the values of the sme - specific parameters is the planck scale , namely , the planck mass @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that coefficients with higher mass dimensions have to possess additional factors of @xmath28 with respect to the others @xcite .",
    "it is obvious then that the lagrangian terms containing the coefficients with the highest possible mass dimensions ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) are of primary importance for a particle with a given energy @xmath30 since they do not involve any derivatives . in particular ,",
    "if one has the relation @xmath31 for the characteristic scales of the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath18 then the average values of the corresponding lagrangian terms are related as follows : @xmath32 , and this is also valid for the other appropriate terms in ( [ theory_l_even_lepton])([theory_l_odd_photon ] ) as well .",
    "thus , one may neglect the effects caused by non - zero dimensionless lorentz - violating coefficients in the extended qed when studying the dominant phenomena at feasible energies .    taken together , the arguments presented above justify the choice of a simplified model ( obtained from the extended qed ) in which there exists only one type of lorentz invariance violation described by means of the cpt - odd fermion lagrangian term @xmath2 where @xmath33 .",
    "as we believe , this is appropriate for investigating whether @xmath34 is indeed much greater than other related parameters of the extended qed by way of studying the characteristics of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is an important phenomenon that can not be neglected in our case when considering the motion of an electron in a magnetic field : vacuum magnetic moment of the particle .",
    "indeed , provided @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xcite , the characteristic energy of the corresponding interaction is @xmath37 in the typical laboratory field @xmath38 , so it may be of the same order of magnitude as the quantity @xmath7 ( or may be less or greater , the latter being somewhat more likely ) .",
    "thus , we may not neglect the influence of the vacuum magnetic moment when studying the synchrotron radiation with account of the lorentz invariance violation in the form we have chosen , and it turns out that the electron vacuum magnetic moment does interact with the condensate @xmath23 in a nontrivial way giving rise to the prevailing observable effects ( see the main text below ) .",
    "we have considered the lagrangian ( [ theory_l ] ) in the context of the sme which is based on the conjecture of spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking in a more fundamental and profound theory , e.g. , string theory ( this is the approach generally adopted in @xcite ) . at the same time ,",
    "similar and even the same terms as those present in ( [ theory_l ] ) can arise under some other circumstances .",
    "in particular , it has been shown @xcite that certain weak background effects possible in some generalized theories of gravity should also affect the sme - specific coefficients in ( [ theory_l_even_lepton])([theory_l_odd_photon ] ) , and concerning the quantity @xmath23 , one can obtain the following leading - order expression for its effective value : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the antisymmetric part of the vierbein fluctuation against the minkowski space - time background and @xmath41 is the torsion tensor of the riemann - cartan space - time ( for more detail , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus , global space - time curvature and possible torsion of the universe obviously lead to the effects similar to those of the spontaneous lorentz invariance breaking , so that they may interfere in a peculiar way enhancing or cancelling each other ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a mechanism generating similar effects of lorentz invariance violation involving chiral fermions has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "anyway , in general , since the lagrangian ( [ theory_l ] ) and the experimental bounds on the sme - specific coefficients of the extended qed are actually model - independent ( they are derived using the standard quantum field theory techniques ) , the origin of these coefficients does not affect the way we are going to investigate the model and examine the phenomena arising , provided that the effective lorentz - violating parameters remain constant in the space - time region being large enough ( and this is usually assumed when working in the context of the sme ) .",
    "in what follows , we study the motion of an electron in an external magnetic field at the quantum level and obtain the characteristics of its electromagnetic radiation using the techniques of qed .",
    "the lagrangian obtained for an electron interacting with the electromagnetic field @xmath42 and background constant condensate field @xmath3 has the form : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the electromagnetic field tensor ; @xmath45 is the electron anomalous ( vacuum ) magnetic moment @xcite , which we treat approximately as a constant quantity : @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xcite ; @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 .",
    "we accept @xmath48 so that the electron charge @xmath49 , and the covariant derivative is @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that in the laboratory reference frame @xmath33 , @xmath51 ; let there also exist a constant homogeneous external magnetic field oriented along the @xmath52-axis : @xmath53 , @xmath54 .    one can , considering an electron with a definite energy so that @xmath55 , represent the equations of motion for the field @xmath6 resulting from ( [ model_l ] ) in the hamiltonian form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the hermitian energy operator : @xmath58 @xmath59 is the canonical quantum - mechanical momentum , @xmath60 ; @xmath61 , @xmath62 . in order to perform the quantization of the theory",
    ", one must solve the eigenvalue problem ( [ sol_hpsi_epsi ] ) and find a complete system of the electron wave functions @xmath63 .",
    "let us take the electromagnetic potential of the external magnetic field in the axial - symmetric form : @xmath64 it is obvious that @xmath65 = 0 $ ] , therefore we shall further consider the problem ( [ sol_hpsi_epsi ] ) on the subspace with a definite fixed @xmath66 : @xmath67 so that ( [ sol_hpsi_epsi ] ) turns into @xmath68 where in the expression ( [ model_h ] ) for the @xmath57 one must take @xmath69 so that @xmath70 ( we use the `` hat '' symbol to denote operators in order to distinguish them from @xmath71-values where a confusion is possible ) . let us introduce now the `` mixing angle '' @xmath72 as follows : @xmath73 so that @xmath74 where @xmath75 we shall name the quantity @xmath76 an effective anomalous magnetic moment . using the angle @xmath72 , we go over to the effective mass and momentum : @xmath77 it should be noted that the effective mass @xmath78 may take negative values , when @xmath79 .",
    "it is easy to see that with the help of the unitary transformation @xmath80 where @xmath81 the hamiltonian ( [ model_h ] ) can be brought to the following form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 are the same as in the hamiltonian ( [ model_h ] ) ) .",
    "thus the problem ( [ sol_hphi_ephi ] ) is formally equivalent to the problem @xmath86 since the operators @xmath87 and @xmath57 have identical eigenvalues , and their eigenvectors are related by the transformation ( [ sol_u_def ] ) : @xmath88 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ sol_tilde_h ] ) formally describes an electron with an anomalous magnetic moment in an external magnetic field without lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "the corresponding problem ( [ sol_tilde_hphi_ephi ] ) has been studied and solved in @xcite ( this work , however , deals with the physical electron with mass greater than zero ; nevertheless it can be easily seen that in the case @xmath89 one can , with the help of one more unitary transformation , @xmath90 , effectively perform the change in the hamiltonian : @xmath91 , @xmath92 ; after that all results obtained in @xcite can be applied to @xmath93 ) .",
    "let us give here only the final results of the solution of the problem ( [ sol_hphi_ephi ] ) .",
    "the energy values under investigation can be written as follows : @xmath94 where @xmath95 the quantity @xmath96 is the eigenvalue of the electron polarization ( or spin ) operator @xmath97 where @xmath98 , \\qquad      \\pi_{\\| } = { \\bf \\sigma } { \\bf p},\\ ] ] which can be diagonalized together with @xmath57 ; it is defined in an unambiguous way ( when @xmath99 ) .",
    "this operator can be named a `` mixed '' spin operator since it is a superposition of the well - known transversal @xmath100 and longitudinal @xmath101 polarization parts with the coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively ( for the properties of the electron spin operators see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the expression ( [ sol_pi_values ] ) @xmath104 is the principal quantum number ; it can be easily proved that the corresponding integral of motion is @xmath105 with the eigenvalues @xmath106 . in the case of @xmath107 ,",
    "the sign of @xmath96 ( i.e. , the spin orientation ) as it follows from ( [ sol_pi_values ] ) takes a definite value .",
    "when @xmath108 it depends on @xmath109 ( through @xmath78 , according to ( [ sol_mpeff_def ] ) ) .",
    "besides , it is clear that the form ( [ sol_pi_def ] ) is valid not only under the assumption ( [ sol_psi_phi ] ) but also in the general case when @xmath110 ; moreover @xmath96 is a gauge - invariant quantity ( as it contains only the gauge - invariant canonical momentum @xmath111 ) .",
    "the wave functions corresponding to the spectrum ( [ sol_e ] ) in the polar coordinate system @xmath112 are as follows : @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the laguerre functions : @xmath115 expressed by means of the generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath116 : @xmath117 @xmath118 is the radial quantum number ; @xmath119 are constant coefficients depending on the particle state .",
    "the solutions ( [ sol_phi ] ) are chosen to be the eigenfunctions of the @xmath52-component of the fermion particle angular momentum operator @xmath120 , which corresponds to the axial symmetry existing in our problem : @xmath121    in the standard ( or dirac ) representation of the @xmath122-matrices the coefficients @xmath123 , which meet the normalization requirement for the wave functions @xmath124 can be written as follows : @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 the expression ( [ sol_coeffs ] ) is valid for all @xmath104 and @xmath78 . it should be noted that expressions ( [ sol_e ] ) , ( [ sol_pi_values ] ) for the energy @xmath128 and the quantity @xmath96 and expression ( [ sol_coeffs ] ) for the coefficients @xmath119 do not include the quantum number @xmath129 .",
    "this degeneracy is typical of the electron in a uniform magnetic field problem and is related to the invariance with respect to the choice of the position of the electron center of orbit .",
    "thus we have found the eigenvalues and obtained the orthonormalized eigenfunction system of the hamiltonian @xmath57 ; the full set of quantum numbers is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 the wave functions and the energy spectrum are formally similar in structure to those of the problem without lorentz invariance breaking considered in @xcite .",
    "however in our case , the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath132 , @xmath76 are effective quantities depending , as well as the coefficients ( [ sol_coeffs ] ) , on the mixing angle @xmath72 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the electromagnetic radiation of an electron moving in a magnetic field using the wave functions obtained earlier .",
    "the radiation is handled at the entirely quantum level , in contrast to the classical approach adopted in most of the present - day publications on the similar subject ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall calculate the asymptotic expressions for the spectral - angular distribution of the one - photon radiation of a high - energy electron in the weak - field limit .",
    "unlike schwinger s method that takes only the first quantum corrections into account @xcite , we use the technique that provides us with _ all _ the quantum corrections arising . in this respect ,",
    "our results are _ exact _",
    "( i.e. , we do not actually make any expansion in powers of @xmath133 ) , although they are _ asymptotic _ , appropriate for the case of the weak magnetic field @xmath134 ( with respect to schwinger s critical field @xmath135 ) , with the small parameter being the ratio of the mass of the electron to its energy .",
    "it is essential to consider the radiation phenomena at the quantum level , since the effects we are interested in ( related to the lorentz invariance violation present in the theory ) are actually due to the change of the spin state of the electron ( described by coefficients ( [ sol_coeffs ] ) of the wave functions ( [ sol_phi ] ) ) , and spin effects should disappear in the classical limit .",
    "consider the electron throughout this section ; the generalization for positrons is straightforward . ]",
    "transitions from some given initial state @xmath136 with energy @xmath128 to a lower state @xmath137 with energy @xmath138 .",
    "assuming the system of the wave functions is orthonormalized , the total radiation power obtained using the methods of qed ( the standard feynman rules ) can be written in the first order of @xmath139 as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite ; we follow the approach of @xcite , @xcite while describing the theory of the synchrotron radiation in this section ) : @xmath140 here @xmath141 is the wave vector of the photon emitted , so that the energy of the photon is @xmath142 ; @xmath143 is the vector characterizing the polarization properties of the photon ( it is always orthogonal to @xmath141 ; the radiation is treated in the temporal gauge ) ; the vector quantity @xmath144 is related to the transition amplitude : @xmath145    let @xmath146 be the angles characterizing the direction of the radiation of a given polarization in a spherical coordinate system with the @xmath52-axis parallel to the magnetic field orientation , so that @xmath147 evaluating the integral in ( [ rad_alpha_def ] ) , due to the general form of the wave functions ( [ sol_psi_phi ] ) , ( [ sol_phi ] ) , one finds ( see @xcite for the details of these calculations ) : @xmath148 where @xmath149 and this is obtained , of course , using the standard representation of the @xmath122-matrices we have chosen .",
    "the argument of all laguerre functions in ( [ rad_alpha ] ) is defined as follows : @xmath150 the quantities with and without a dash in ( [ rad_alpha ] ) are related to the final and initial state of the electron respectively , and we also use this notation in what follows .",
    "making the summation over the quantum numbers @xmath151 characterizing the final state and evaluating the integral over @xmath152 in ( [ rad_w_def ] ) , one obtains the expression for the radiation power ( related to one unit of length of the @xmath52-axis ) : @xmath153 where @xmath152 and @xmath154 obey the conservation laws of the energy and @xmath52-component of the momentum : @xmath155 we use the symbol @xmath156 to denote a derivative of the energy @xmath138 considered as a function of @xmath154 , where @xmath154 is defined through ( [ rad_conserv_cond ] ) , with respect to @xmath152 , with @xmath157 being fixed .",
    "it is important that since there exists the relation ( see @xcite ) : @xmath158 the summation has taken the numbers @xmath129 , @xmath159 out of consideration ; this is closely connected with the degeneracy and invariance existing in our problem ( see section [ sol ] ) .",
    "thus , the initial quantum number @xmath129 may be arbitrary .",
    "note that we are still considering the electron initial and final states with the definite spin quantum numbers @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively , i.e. , we do not make any averaging or summation over them .",
    "let us now consider the most interesting case of a high - energy particle ( @xmath162 ) in a comparatively weak magnetic field ( @xmath163 ) with the initial longitudinal momentum @xmath164 , which corresponds to the electron states with @xmath165 .",
    "indeed , examining this case , one approximately finds from ( [ sol_e ] ) : @xmath166 when calculating radiation effects we shall restrict ourselves to the zero approximation in @xmath167 .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to prove that only three small parameters are of importance in our problem : @xmath168 , @xmath72 , @xmath167 .",
    "however , it is easily seen then that under typical laboratory conditions ( @xmath169 , @xmath38 ) the estimate @xmath170 is valid if only @xmath171 , which justifies our approximation @xmath172 for this range of @xmath173 ( see also the discussion ) .",
    "it is obvious that the chosen approximation @xmath174 reduces the problem to the case of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath175 which follows from ( [ model_h ] ) , when @xmath176 , @xmath177 . operator ( [ rad_h ] ) has the spectrum @xmath178 and admits of an ambiguity in the choice of a spin operator commuting with it ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in our case , however , this ambiguity is removed and the operator ( [ sol_pi_def ] ) should be used , which corresponds to a `` mixed '' ( transversal - longitudinal ) polarization of the particle . thus , the problem is formally reduced to the radiation of an electron without an anomalous magnetic moment or lorentz symmetry violation , polarized in a definite way .",
    "this ( namely the dispersion law ( [ rad_e ] ) and the general form of the wave functions ( [ sol_psi_phi ] ) , ( [ sol_phi ] ) ) makes the well - known theory of synchrotron radiation considered in @xcite , @xcite applicable to our case .",
    "in particular , if relation ( [ rad_e ] ) holds , then system ( [ rad_conserv_cond ] ) can be solved unambiguously with respect to @xmath152 , @xmath154 , and this yields ( note that we are considering the case @xmath164 ) : @xmath179 since we are considering the states with @xmath165 , it is a good approximation to change the sum in ( [ rad_w_sum ] ) into an integral treating @xmath157 as a continuous variable . with the help of ( [ rad_k_from_conserv_cond ] ) ,",
    "it is possible to change the variable of integration from @xmath157 to @xmath152 explicitly : @xmath180 in that way , one obtains the spectral - angular distribution @xmath181 of the radiation ( we imply , of course , that @xmath182 ) : @xmath183    in the case @xmath184 we are interested in are actually suppressed when @xmath165 , so that our consideration is consistent . the issues concerning the approximation we make are discussed in @xcite in more detail . ] , there exist the asymptotic expressions for the laguerre functions present in ( [ rad_alpha ] ) : @xmath185 where @xmath186 are the modified bessel functions of the second kind , @xmath187 the dimensionless spectral variable @xmath188 is related to the photon energy @xmath152 by the formula : @xmath189 the coefficients in front of the functions @xmath186 in ( [ rad_i_k ] ) and the quantity @xmath52 in ( [ rad_i_k_vars ] ) are written in the second and leading order of @xmath168 respectively taking into account that , as it can be easily seen , the quantities @xmath190 and @xmath191 also have the same order of smallness as @xmath168 .",
    "the latter is valid in the range of @xmath192 where @xmath186 are essentially different from zero ; from the physical point of view this corresponds to the fact that the radiation of a high - energy particle is concentrated close to the plane of its orbit , and the typical angle of deviation or the spread angle is @xmath193 .    now using the new variable @xmath188 instead of @xmath152 ,",
    "one finds : @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the total power of the synchrotron radiation of a high - energy particle in the classical limit and @xmath196 is the spectral - angular distribution ( normalized and related to @xmath188 ) .",
    "we shall omit the superscript and denote it as @xmath197 in what follows .",
    "we also express it through the quantity @xmath198 , since @xmath199 represents the angular distribution in a rather convenient way ( see the results below ) .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath200 introduced in ( [ rad_i_k_vars ] ) is known as the parameter characterizing the quantum corrections to the radiation . actually , recovering the dimensional constants @xmath133 and @xmath71 , we find ( note that we are still using the natural scale for @xmath201 so that the fine structure constant is @xmath202 ) : @xmath203 it is easily seen that @xmath133 emerges exactly through @xmath200 in our problem . at the same time , @xmath133 is cancelled out in the leading order ( classical ) expressions , e.g. , @xmath204 in the case under investigation , although we require @xmath205 , @xmath134 , the quantity @xmath200 may take _ arbitrary _ values , and we do not make any expansion in its powers . in this respect ,",
    "our results are exact , including all the quantum corrections arising . at the same time , pure classical methods widely adopted in the literature are only applicable when @xmath206 .      exploiting ( [ rad_i_k ] ) ,",
    "one can obtain the corresponding asymptotic expressions for @xmath207 , @xmath199 and thus for @xmath197 .",
    "considering the @xmath208- and @xmath209-components of the linear polarization of radiation - polarization , the electric field vector @xmath210 is in the @xmath211-plane , while for the @xmath209-polarization , the magnetic field vector * h * lies in this plane . ]",
    ", one can choose @xmath143 as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath212 this corresponds to @xmath213 in ( [ rad_k ] ) .",
    "the specific value of the angle @xmath214 is inessential due to the axial symmetry present in our problem .",
    "thus , one obtains : @xmath215 according to ( [ rad_conserv_cond ] ) and ( [ rad_y_def ] ) ( taking into account that @xmath164 ) , one has : @xmath216 this implies that @xmath217 , @xmath218 also have the order of smallness of @xmath168 .",
    "note that , by means of ( [ sol_pi_values ] ) , ( [ rad_e ] ) the quantity @xmath96 can be expressed in terms of @xmath128 and @xmath132 as follows : @xmath219 deriving the latter formula , we have neglected the case @xmath107 in ( [ sol_pi_values ] ) since it is inessential in our approach .",
    "now it is possible to write down the quantities defined in ( [ sol_abpq ] ) , related both to the initial and the final states , expressing them in terms of @xmath168 , @xmath191 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 ( and also @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) .",
    "so we use ( [ rad_alpha ] ) , then ( [ sol_coeffs ] ) , ( [ sol_alpha_beta ] ) , ( [ sol_abpq ] ) ( taking into account ( [ rad_pi ] ) ) to evaluate ( [ rad_s_sigma_pi ] ) ; after that we make expansions in powers of @xmath168 , @xmath191 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , keeping the terms up to the order of @xmath220 .",

    "\\end{array }      $ ]    from ( [ rad_phi_sigma])([rad_phi_pi ] ) one can see that the effect caused by the proposed existence of lorentz invariance violation in our theory reveals itself in asymmetry of the angular distributions @xmath229 relative to the @xmath230 plane ( i.e. to the plane of the particle orbit ) .",
    "asymmetry of this kind is inherent in the radiation of the longitudinally polarized electron and is totally absent in the case of the transversal polarization ; one should remember that considering the influence of the anomalous magnetic moment ( without lorentz invariance violation ) only the transversal polarization of an electron moving in a magnetic field is conserved .",
    "this fact is obvious from ( [ sol_pi_def ] ) with @xmath231 , of course , in case when the states of an electron under consideration are the eigenvectors of its hamiltonian and the time dependence of its wave functions is described by the factor @xmath232 ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if lorentz invariance violation is present ( in the form we have chosen in this work ) the electron spin integral of motion receives an additional longitudinal part and takes the form ( [ sol_pi_def ] ) , and according to this , the electron electromagnetic radiation is changed .",
    "experimental detection of asymmetry of the angular distribution of the synchrotron radiation of electrons polarized according to their own ( conserved ) spin operator could provide a possibility to estimate the quantity @xmath72 and hence @xmath173 as its function . in order to characterize this asymmetry one can use , e.g. , the quantity @xmath233 where @xmath234 it is clear that in the linear approximation we have @xmath235 , where the proportionality factor can be numerically calculated for any given photon energy .",
    "the typical curves for @xmath229 ( namely , for the normalized functions @xmath236 , where @xmath237 ) are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : phi_phys ] and [ fig : phi_good ] .",
    "the corresponding asymmetry coefficient @xmath238 is shown in each diagram . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_good ] we plotted the curves for the high values of @xmath239 , @xmath72 and the low value of @xmath128 in order to make the asymmetry in @xmath240 more visible .",
    "the change in the angular distribution and the specific asymmetry of the synchrotron radiation of an electron caused by the assumed existence of lorentz invariance violation have already been discussed in literature , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , calculations in @xcite , as well as in @xcite , were based on semi - classical methods outside the framework of the standard model extension .",
    "moreover , specific modified lorentz non - invariant dispersion laws for photons and electrons were adopted there . in this paper ,",
    "in contrast to @xcite , @xcite , we used the sme technique and employed the standard methods of qed .",
    "our results are based on exact solutions of the dirac equation for an electron with a vacuum magnetic moment in a constant magnetic field .",
    "they are due to the peculiar non - perturbative interaction of the electron vacuum magnetic moment @xmath45 with the condensate @xmath241 violating lorentz invariance .",
    "in our work , we considered the radiation phenomena at the entirely quantum level and obtained the asymptotic expressions for the spectral - angular distribution for the case of a high - energy particle moving in a relatively weak magnetic field ; these expressions incorporate all the quantum corrections in our problem .",
    "the reason is that specific effects caused by the lorentz invariance violation present in the theory are closely connected with spin effects , and they should be handled using the quantum approach ; moreover , classical and semi - classical methods widely adopted in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite ) may not be actually applicable .",
    "the results we have obtained provide us with the possibility of making some estimates of the parameter @xmath173 governing the effects of lorentz invariance violation in our problem .",
    "first of all , it is believed ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) that it is the transversal electron polarization that is primarily observed in synchrotron - radiation experiments .",
    "this implies that the `` mixing angle '' @xmath72 defined in ( [ sol_vartheta_def ] ) should be sufficiently small ( since the type of polarization depends on it , see ( [ sol_pi_def ] ) ) under the laboratory conditions ( @xmath169 , @xmath242 ) , and this yields the estimate : @xmath243 in the first approximation , we used here well - known schwinger s result for the value of the vacuum magnetic moment : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ( see also the discussion below ) . result ( [ outro_b_est ] )",
    "is more stringent than the typical estimates available in the literature , e.g. , in @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", one may argue that in case of reliable observation of radiation of the vacuum magnetic moment ( the theory of which was developed in @xcite ) in the absence of any effects caused by @xmath244 , the estimate becomes appreciably stronger .",
    "in fact , as it has been shown , the prevailing effect of @xmath244 is the asymmetry of the synchrotron radiation , while the radiation of the vacuum magnetic moment ( governed by the small parameter @xmath245 ) is symmetric with respect to the plane of the particle orbit ( of course , it is assumed here that the particle is transversally polarized and no lorentz invariance violation is then present ) .",
    "so if no asymmetry is detected but the radiation of the vacuum magnetic moment is actually observed ( and it is not distorted in any way ) , it is reasonable to consider that the small parameters of our problem are related as follows : @xmath246 . by virtue of the definitions of @xmath72 and @xmath76 ( [ sol_vartheta_def ] ) , ( [ sol_mueff_def ] ) , this condition also guarantees @xmath247 with very good precision , and it is satisfied when @xmath248 however , the latter estimate may need more justification since we did not provide explicit calculations , and there are also some issues concerning the possibility of reliable experimental observation of radiation of the vacuum magnetic moment and its interpretation .",
    "the fact is , when @xmath171 we may neglect the small parameter @xmath167 while considering the radiation phenomena . in our calculations we regarded the quantity @xmath45 as a constant , which depends neither on the particle state nor on the magnetic field strength",
    "however , consistent consideration of the vacuum magnetic moment phenomenon leads to the conclusion that such a dependence does exist , and , in particular , @xmath45 decreases with growing particle energy @xcite , @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the existence of lorentz invariance violation , of course , also modifies the vacuum magnetic moment behavior @xcite . when considering this issue",
    ", one has to work with not only the fermion but also the photon sector of the model due to the nature of the vacuum magnetic moment phenomenon @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in our case , at experimentally feasible energies , the vacuum magnetic moment should have the general form : @xmath249 where @xmath250 denotes the well - known standard result for the function @xmath251 @xcite , @xcite ( in the zero approximation , in a weak field , it is the constant value found by schwinger ) , and the corrections arise through lorentz non - invariant interactions of the particle .",
    "thus , one has from ( [ sol_vartheta_def ] ) and ( [ outro_mu_liv ] ) : @xmath252 and since we are actually interested in calculating @xmath72 in the leading order of the parameters characterizing lorentz invariance violation ( as we believe that they are _ small _ numbers ) , we may neglect these additional corrections , preserving only @xmath173 in the numerator : @xmath253 the latter expression is finally used when deriving all the estimates .",
    "thus , according to the comments given above and to definition ( [ sol_vartheta_def ] ) of the angle @xmath72 , one may conclude that it should increase with growing electron energy ( while the second small parameter @xmath167 of our problem , on the contrary , decreases at least like @xmath254 ) .",
    "this means that the effect of the asymmetry of the angular distribution of the synchrotron radiation described in this work should become more noticeable with growing electron energy @xmath128 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that since formulae ( [ rad_phi_sigma])([rad_phi_pi ] ) of this work were obtained under the assumption @xmath255 , one can use them for relatively soft photons only , when final electron states have approximately the same value of @xmath72 as the initial one .    the type of the lorentz symmetry breaking studied in this paper on the basis of the standard model extension and the particular choice of @xmath33 does not , of course , exhaust all the possibilities , that can actually find their realization in nature .",
    "nonetheless , the effect of mixing of transversal and longitudinal polarizations of an electron , with an interpretation suggested in this work , may provide one of the tests of the possible violation of lorentz invariance .",
