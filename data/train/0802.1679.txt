    "advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) is an important type of solution for black hole accretion .",
    "a prominent feature of an adaf compared to the standard thin disk is its low radiative efficient at low accretion rates ( narayan & yi 1994 , hereafter ny94 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; see narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 and kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 for reviews ) .",
    "the adaf solution has received much attention in the past years because it successfully explains why some nearby galaxies are so dim even though their accretion rates are not very small ( see narayan 2005 , yuan 2007 , and ho 2008 for reviews ) .",
    "the best evidence comes from the supermassive black hole in our galactic center , sgr a * ( narayan , mahadevan & yi 1995 ; manmoto , kusunoze & mineshige 1997 ; yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) . from _",
    "observations and bondi theory , we can estimate the mass accretion rate of sgr a*. if the accretion flow were not an adaf but a standard thin disk , the luminosity would be five orders of magnitude larger than observed ( yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) .    another attractive feature of an adaf is that it can partly solve the problem of the origin of x - ray emission from accretion flows .",
    "the temperature of a standard thin disk at the inner disk is only @xmath1k for a supermassive black hole , too low to produce x - ray emission ( frank , king & raine 2002 ) .",
    "a hot corona has been thought to be responsible for the x - ray emission , but recent mhd simulations of disks show that they have hardly any coronae ( hirose , krolik & stone 2006 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature of an adaf is high enough to produce x - ray emission .",
    "of course , a canonical adaf exists only below a critical accretion rate @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the viscous parameter , which corresponds to @xmath5 at most ( esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ) .",
    "therefore it can not explain luminous x - ray sources such as quasars .",
    "the luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf ; yuan 2001 ) , which is an extension of an adaf to higher accreton rates , is promising , but the details of this model have not been fully worked out ( see yuan et al .",
    "2007 for an example of application to luminous black hole x - ray binaries ) .    in spite of the great success of adafs ,",
    "more work is required to test the model . on the one hand , it would useful to expand the application of adafs to more sources , and on the another hand , such modeling is expected to help us understand some important microphysical issues which are still unclear .",
    "one example of the latter is the value of @xmath6 ( defined in eqs . 4 and 5 ) , which measures the amount of direct electron heating through viscous dissipation in a hot accretion flow ( sharma et al .",
    "another is the potential importance of collective plasma effects which will determine how realistic the two - temperature assumption is ( begelman & chiueh 1988 ; yuan et al .",
    "2006 ) .    for such work ,",
    "the global solution rather than the self - similar solution of the adaf equations is required .",
    "this is because most of the radiation of an adaf comes from its innermost region where the self - similar solution breaks down .",
    "however , it is technically very difficult to calculate the global solution of an adaf .",
    "an adaf is transonic , and thus its global solution should satisfy the sonic - point condition in addition to the outer boundary condition .",
    "mathematically , it is a two point boundary value problem and not easy to deal with .",
    "this is an obstacle to the wide application of the adaf model .    in this paper",
    "we propose a simplified global adaf solution .",
    "we adopt a simple algebraic relation to replace the radial momentum equation , thus avoiding the two point boundary value problem .",
    "we present our approach in  2 and show some examples in  3 .",
    "the final section is devoted to a short summary . watarai ( 2007 ) has recently presented related work .",
    "the basic equations of an adaf describe the conservation of mass , radial and aximuthal components of the momentum , and energy ( e.g. , narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ) :    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    all the quantities have their usual meaning . in the present paper",
    "we do not include outflows from the adaf , but it is easy to extend our calculation to that case by simply using a radius - dependent mass accretion rate , @xmath12 with @xmath13 being a constant ( e.g. , yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) describes the fraction of the turbulent dissipation rate @xmath14 which directly heats electrons ; we set @xmath15 .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 describes the energy transfer rate from ions to electrons by coulomb collision , and @xmath17 is the radiative cooling rate .",
    "we consider synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emissions and their comptonization .",
    "the details of the calculation of the spectrum can be found in yuan , quataert & narayan ( 2003 ) .",
    "we consider a schwarzschild black hole and adopt the paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) potential to mimic its geometry .",
    "the most difficult part of solving the global solution is the radial momentum equation ( 2 ) .",
    "our key idea of simplifying the global adaf solution is to replace this differential equation by the following simple algebraic relation : @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "the above simplification is based on the following physical consideration .",
    "the immediate idea we think of to simplify the radial momentum equation is to use the self - similar solution obtained by ny94 .",
    "consider eqs .",
    "( 7)-(9 ) in ny94",
    ". we can use eq .",
    "( 9 ) to solve for @xmath21 in terms of the sound speed @xmath22 : 5 + 2^=2 , ^=-",
    ". we can then substitute this in eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 7 ) in ny94 to obtain for a fully advection - dominated flow ( @xmath23 ) = ( 1-)^1/2 = = const .",
    "here @xmath24 is the adiabatic index .",
    "we therefore in principle could set @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) to this constant . however , we find that the simplfied solution is very sensitive to the value of @xmath25 .",
    "the reason is that , as we will see , the radial velocity is sensitive to the value of @xmath25 ( ref .",
    "eq . 9 below ) .",
    "the velocity determines the density , and also the temperature via the energy equations , two quantities that determine the emitted spectrum .",
    "we therefore set @xmath25 as a free parameter which we adjust for different accretion parameters @xmath26 and @xmath4 to get the best approximation .    because the angular momentum @xmath27 in a global solution keeps decreasing with decreasing radius , while the keplerian angular momentum @xmath28 begins to increase when @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , @xmath25 can not be a constant when @xmath29 .",
    "instead we require the angular momentum to be continuous at @xmath30 and assume that it is proportional to @xmath31 . after some tests we set @xmath32 , independent of the values of @xmath26 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus @xmath33 is not a free parameter in our model .    substituting eq.(6 ) into eq.(3 ) we have @xmath34 the quantity @xmath35 is the specific angular momentum of the accretion gas when it falls into the black hole and it is the eigenvalue of the exact global solution . in our simplified model , we set @xmath35 as the second free parameter and adjust its value to get the best approximate solution for @xmath36 .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) into the energy equations for ions and electrons , eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , we have two differential equations with two unknown variables , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "all other quantites such as @xmath36 , @xmath39 , @xmath22 and @xmath40 can be expressed as simple functions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 for a given @xmath26 and @xmath4 and assumed values of the free parameters @xmath41 and @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given at the outer boundary , we can easily integrate the differential equations inwards to get the approximate global solution .",
    "we adjust the values of @xmath41 and @xmath35 for different @xmath26 and @xmath4 to get the best simplified global solution . here",
    "`` best '' means that the profiles of all quantities such as @xmath42 , and most importantly , the emitted spectrum , are very close to the exact global solution .",
    "because our main purpose is to model the continuum spectrum of black hole sources ( agns and black hole x - ray binaries ) , our first priority will be the closeness of the spectrum when we judge how good a simplified solution is .    in the calculations presented here",
    ", we set @xmath26 of the approximate solution equal to @xmath26 of the global solution it is meant to fit .",
    "however , in real applications , we only know the spectrum rather than @xmath26 .",
    "so it might be more realistic to adjust @xmath43 of the simplified solution to fit the spectrum produced by the exact global solution with a given @xmath44 rather than setting @xmath45 .",
    "fortunately we find that @xmath46 and @xmath44 are very close , typically eviating by no more than @xmath47 .",
    "when modeling black hole sources with an adaf model , the accretion rate @xmath26 spans a wide range , say from @xmath48 to @xmath49 . but",
    "the value of @xmath4 adopted in adaf modeling ( e.g. , narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ) is usually within a very narrow range , @xmath0 .",
    "this is also supported by mhd numerical simulations of accretion flows ( e.g. , hawley & krolik 2001 ) .",
    "we adjust the values of @xmath35 and @xmath41 to obtain the `` best '' simplified adaf solutions for @xmath26 and @xmath4 within the above ranges . as state below we find that the same set of ( @xmath50 ) often holds for quite a wide range of @xmath26",
    ".      we first present results for @xmath51 .",
    "we find that in this case the simplified global solution with @xmath52 gives a satisfactory spectrum for any @xmath26 .",
    "1 & 2 give two examples with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure denote the exact global solution while the solid lines are for the simplified global solution .",
    "the plots in each figure show the emitted spectrum , mach number , electron and ion temperature , density , and the angular momentum , respectively . for fig .",
    "1 , the outer boundary is at @xmath55 and the outer boundary condition is @xmath56 with the virial temperature @xmath57 . for fig .",
    "2 , the outer boundary is at @xmath58 and the outer boundary condition is @xmath59 .      when @xmath60 , it is hard for a single set of ( @xmath63 ) to give a good solution for all @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath26 is relatively low , @xmath62 , we find @xmath61 gives a satisfactory solution . fig .",
    "3 shows an example with @xmath64 .",
    "the outer boundary conditions are @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath26 is relatively high , @xmath69 , we find @xmath67 gives a satisfactory solution .",
    "4 shows an example of @xmath70 .",
    "the outer boundary conditions are @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "note this solution is in the regime of lhaf , because @xmath49 is well above the critical accretion rate of an adaf @xmath73 .      for other values of @xmath4",
    ", we find that simply using the `` linear fit '' values of @xmath74 between those for @xmath51 and @xmath75 gives a good solution .",
    "for example , for @xmath76 and @xmath64 , the values of @xmath35 and @xmath41 are just @xmath77 . for @xmath76 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the global solution of adafs is difficult to calculate because it is mathematically a two point boundary value problem .",
    "this hampers wide application of the adaf model .",
    "we propose a simplifed global solution to overcome this difficulty .",
    "prompted by the self - similar solution of adafs , we replace the radial momentum equation , which is the most difficult to handle , with a simple algebraic relation ( eq .",
    "6 ) , and then solve the remaining two diferential equations ( eqs . 4 & 5 ) .",
    "we adjust the two free parameters ( @xmath35 and @xmath41 in eqs . 6 and 9 ) so that we obtain the best approximation compared to the exact global adaf solution .",
    "the spectra of the simplified solutions are impressively good , as shown in figs",
    ". 1 - 4 for various @xmath26 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have been unable to identify a single set of values of the two adjustable constants @xmath35 and @xmath41 which works for all adaf models . however , when @xmath4 is large , say @xmath80 , we find that @xmath81 , @xmath82 gives very good results for all accretion rates @xmath26 for which an adaf solution is possible .",
    "recent work by sharma et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggests that the viscosity parameter in the collisionless plasma in a hot accretion flow will be larger than in a standard thin disk .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 is probably not unrealistic for an adaf",
    ". it would thus be reasonable to use a single set of parameters , @xmath51 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , for practical applications of the approximate global model described here .",
    "the success of the present work encourages us to extend our approach to the case of a slim disk , which is an extension of the standard thin disk to accretion rates above the eddington rate ( abramowicz et al .",
    "it potentially has important application in ulxs and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( mineshige et al .",
