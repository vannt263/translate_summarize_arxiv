    "granular materials are ubiquitous in our daily life and are extensively studied mainly in various engineering fields such as soil mechanics , geology , powder technology , and civil engineering @xcite .",
    "they are also studied in the area of statistical physics @xcite because they exhibit various interesting phenomena , such as jamming transition and inhomogeneous cluster formation @xcite .",
    "these phenomena originate from the dissipative nature of granular particles during inelastic collisions .",
    "granular gas is one of the simplest setups to theoretically understand the essence of granular materials .",
    "indeed , the kinetic theory is applicable to granular gases when the density is not extremely high , where their dissipative nature appears as the non - gaussian velocity distribution function ( vdf ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , high - order cumulants , such as skewness and kurtosis , are expected to play important roles in understanding the characteristic behavior of granular materials in addition to the second - order cumulants ( i.e. , the granular temperature ) @xcite .    a typical method to measure vdfs includes the direct tracking of the motion of grains .",
    "this method is widely used for quasi - two dimensional systems . however , there are technical difficulties for three - dimensional systems because most of grains in the bulk of the system are invisible from the exteriors of containers .",
    "although such difficulties have been overcome using magnetic resonance imaging @xcite or fluorescent interstitial fluid @xcite , the former method is not easily accessible and the latter method induces additional rheological effects via the interstitial fluid on the granular flow .",
    "another experimental method involves the indirect measurement of granular velocity fluctuation via probes .",
    "for example , a rotor can be placed into a granular gas as a probe to measure the angular velocity fluctuation of the rotor @xcite .",
    "the vdf of the granular gas can be inferred from that of the rotor .",
    "it is important to note that this method works well for systems in thermal equilibrium according to the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "recently , the relevance of this type of indirect method has been demonstrated for spatially homogeneous and isotropic granular gases through the analysis of the non - gaussian langevin equation in refs @xcite on the basis of the boltzmann - lorentz equation @xcite . however , the model used in this case is not sufficiently realistic because inhomogeneity and anisotropy exist in real granular gases such as vertically vibrated granular systems under gravity @xcite .",
    "this implies that a more realistic formulation is necessary for the experimental measurement of high - order cumulants by observing the rotor dynamics .    in this study , the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of a realistic granular rotor",
    "is performed to demonstrate the role of a rotor as a probe to measure the vdfs of vibrating granular beds @xcite .",
    "an event driven md simulation of a rotating rotor is performed around a fixed axis in a vertically vibrated granular gas under gravity in accordance with a method used in a previous study ref .",
    "the dynamics of the rotor in vibrating granular beds is analyzed to derive the relationship between the angular vdf of the rotor under viscous or dry friction and the vdf of the granular gas @xcite . in this study",
    ", it is also demonstrated that the formulas can be applied in the md simulation .",
    "the formulas can be used to infer the vdf of a gas with velocities that can not be directly measured .",
    "furthermore , it is demonstrated that the formulas work to detect the dependence of the vdf of the granular gas on its position in the container .",
    "hence , the results indicate that the granular rotor can be used as a local velocity probe for a realistic granular gas .",

    "the parameters in the simulation are summarized in table [ table_setup ] .",
    "both the rotational motion of the grains and the tangential contact force between the grains are not considered in the event - driven md simulation , because the effect of the tangential friction of spherical grains can be absorbed into the effective normal restitution coefficient if the duration ( contact ) time of the grains is negligible @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the extension of the setup is straightforward for dense frictional grains in three - dimensional systems , where the effects of the rotations and the tangential frictions are not negligible .",

    "we have examined the role of a granular rotor as a local non - equilibrium probe through the md simulation of the rotor in vibrating granular beds under gravity . we have observed spatially inhomogeneous vdfs .",
    "we have formulated the inverse formula in cylindrical coordinates to explain the result of the md simulation for a realistic viscous rotor .",
    "starting from the botlzmann - lorentz equation , we have derived analytic formulas for the viscous frictional rotor . on the basis of the derived formulas , we have numerically calculated the angular vdf of the rotor from the data of vdf of the granular gas near the rotor , and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that our inverse formula can be used even if the location of the rotor is different from the center of the container .",
    "thus , the granular rotor is useful as a local probe for non - equilibrium baths .    with respect to a rotor under dry friction ,",
    "only the forward problem is considered , and the result corresponds to the md result .",
    "the present study could not solve the inverse problem for the rotor under dry friction . in order to derive a valid inverse formula for the rotor under dry friction",

    "there are several possible extensions of this study . in the study",
    ", it is assumed that the restitution coefficient of grains is constant @xcite",
    ". however , the restitution coefficient for a sphere depends on the impact velocity @xmath9 as @xmath10 @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the velocity dependence of the restitution coefficient can be introduced to the boltzmann - lorentz equation , and this can be also analyzed by the theory proposed by the present study .",
    "it is necessary to analyze the effects of the tangential interaction and the mutual rotation between grains",
    ". it would be possible and interesting to apply our framework to the rotor in dense granular media @xcite or denser granular liquids near the jamming transition beyond the enskog equation @xcite by modifying the transition probability @xmath11  @xcite .",

    "the collision time between a grain and the rotor is approximately calculated as the time when this distance becomes smaller than the radius of the grain after the virtual updating of the positions . if a grain collides with the wall before colliding with the rotor , it is considered that the grain does not collide with the rotor in this time step .",

    "<S> this study numerically and analytically investigates the dynamics of a rotor under viscous or dry friction as a non - equilibrium probe of a granular gas . in order to demonstrate the role of the rotor as a probe for a non - equilibrium bath </S>",
    "<S> , the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of the rotor is performed under viscous or dry friction surrounded by a steady granular gas under gravity . </S>",
    "<S> a one - to - one map between the velocity distribution function ( vdf ) of the granular gas and the angular distribution function for the rotor is theoretically derived . </S>",
    "<S> the md simulation demonstrates that the one - to - one map accurately infers the local vdf of the granular gas from the angular vdf of the rotor , and vice versa . </S>"
