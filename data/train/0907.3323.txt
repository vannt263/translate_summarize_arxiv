    "<S> we report on the successful implementation of a new approach to locking the frequencies of an opo - based squeezed - vacuum source and its driving laser . </S>",
    "<S> the technique allows the simultaneous measurement of the phase - shifts induced by a cavity , which may be used for the purposes of frequency - locking , as well as the simultaneous measurement of the sub - quantum - noise - limited ( sub - qnl ) phase quadrature output of the opo . </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne locking technique is cheap , easy to implement and has the distinct advantage that subsequent homodyne measurements are automatically phase - locked . </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne locking technique is also unique in that it is a sub - qnl frequency discriminator .    </S>",
    "<S> nonclassical states are considered key resources in quantum information processing applications @xcite , quantum key distribution systems @xcite and high - precision measurements such as gravitational wave interferometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one particular nonclassical state for which a number of applications have been proposed is the vacuum - squeezed state , which is commonly produced via a sub - threshold optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) in continuous - wave systems @xcite .    in such systems , </S>",
    "<S> a squeezed vacuum is created via the non - linear interaction between a classical pump field and the modes of a cavity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mechanical disturbances to the cavity make it impossible to create , measure or use the squeezed vacuum if the opo cavity is left uncontrolled . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , all such systems are frequency - locked to the driving laser .    in order to frequency - lock the opo and driving laser together </S>",
    "<S> , an error signal must be generated that is bipolar and proportional to their frequency detuning . </S>",
    "<S> common approaches to extracting an appropriate error signal include the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) modulation - based technique @xcite or modulation - free techniques such as hnsch - couillaud @xcite and tilt - locking @xcite . these are all quite different techniques , but they share in common the idea that they are implemented separately from the homodyne measurements of the squeezed cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach leaves the squeezed output mode undisturbed and ready to direct towards subsequent experiments or measurement apparatus .    </S>",
    "<S> here we report on the successful implementation of an alternative scheme , which we call homodyne locking , that allows simultaneous measurement of the phase - shift induced by the cavity ( for the purposes of frequency locking ) as well as phase - quadrature homodyne detection of the squeezed output of the opo . </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne locking technique makes use of the principle that a non - resonant mode , which provides the phase reference for frequency - locking , can also be used as the local oscillator in a homodyne detector .    </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne locking technique has the distinct advantage that any subsequent homodyne detector is automatically locked to a known phase angle . </S>",
    "<S> this locking technique is easy and cost - effective to implement as well as , uniquely , being a sub - quantum - noise - limited frequency discriminator .    </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne locking technique is based on the observation that measurements of the phase quadrature of the output of a cavity can be used to estimate the frequency detuning between the input to the cavity and the cavity mode of interest @xcite . that is , assuming a singly - resonant cavity , no pump depletion , and parametric de - amplification , the sub - threshold opo is described by the following set of equations </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 denotes the annihilation operator for the squeezed cavity mode defined in an appropriate rotating frame . </S>",
    "<S> the detuning @xmath2 represents the frequency deviation of the cavity s resonant frequency from the nominal laser frequency @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity decay rates are determined by mirror reflectivities @xmath4 and are given by @xmath5 for a cavity round trip time of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the total decay rate for the fundamental is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the seed field incident on the front face of the cavity is given by @xmath8 and the squeezed output field is @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude and phase quadratures of any field @xmath10 are denoted @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the intra - cavity annihilation operator can be decomposed into @xmath13 as can the seed @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> linearising eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ alpha ] near @xmath16 , we find that steady - state measurements of the phase quadrature of the output field are linearly proportional to the detuning and hence can be used as an error signal .    </S>",
    "<S> . [ cavity-1 ] can also be solved in frequency space for the fluctuating terms to yield an expression for the squeezing spectrum :    @xmath17 + \\delta x_l^{\\pm } 2\\sqrt{\\kappa_{s}\\kappa_l } } { ( \\kappa+i\\omega ) \\mp \\chi } \\label{squeezingsimple}\\ ] ]    here we have set @xmath16 and @xmath18 is a frequency measured relative to one of the longitudinal resonances of the opo cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath18 is small compared to the free - spectral - range ( fsr ) of the opo cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a single measurement of the phase quadrature of the output field affords both a direct measurement of the squeezed output of the sub - threshold opo , eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ squeezingsimple ] , and the detuning between the cavity resonance and the input field as required for frequency locking , eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ alpha ] .    fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ schem ] illustrates schematically the experiment used to demonstrate homodyne locking . </S>",
    "<S> the 532 nm , frequency - doubled output of a diode - pumped , miniature monolithic nd : yag laser is used to pump a sub - threshold opo . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear crystal is periodically - poled ktp , with a phase - matching temperature of @xmath19c . </S>",
    "<S> the opo has a free - spectral range of 199 mhz and is operated with a parametric amplification of 3.9 db and de - amplification of 2.6db . </S>",
    "<S> a small fraction of the source laser power is tapped off prior to frequency - doubling and is used as the seed to the opo and the local oscillator for the homodyne measurements    quadrature homodyne measurement requires a bright , coherently related local oscillator ( lo ) with which to interfere the field of interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of the lo relative to the field of interest determines the measurement quadrature . in the experiments described here the lo co - propagates with the seed to ensure that phase fluctuations are common - mode and hence that the homodyne detector is passively locked to measure the phase quadrature as required by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ alpha ] and [ squeezingsimple ] .    in the experiment </S>",
    "<S> described here 1% of the power of the input field is set to the polarisation appropriate to the nonlinear crystal in the opo cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 99% of the power is in the orthogonal , non - resonant polarisation and acts as the lo . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the only means of implementing passive locking of the homodyne detector . in a previous experiment involving an empty cavity , </S>",
    "<S> the same effect was achieved by using a spatially offset , but co - propagating lo @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the upper trace of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ error ] shows a plot of @xmath20 measured using this technique . in this polarization implementation , </S>",
    "<S> the seed and the local oscillator each produce a dispersion shaped error signal when resonant with the cavity , but with flipped sign relative to each other . the lower trace in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ error ] is a plot of the measured transmission of the seed field through the opo cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the error signal is used to lock the opo cavity to a resonance for the seed mode , which corresponds to one of the peaks in the lower trace in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ error ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuating component of the same homodyne measurement that lead to fig . [ error ] can be used to measure the squeezed output of the opo . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sqz ] is a plot of the variance of the homodyne measurement , @xmath21 , at frequencies near the first resonance of the opo , made when the feedback controller is active . </S>",
    "<S> maximum squeezing of approximately 2db has been observed at the resonant frequency of 199mhz . </S>",
    "<S> coupled with a measured de - amplification of 2.6db , this measurement suggests that the overall escape and detection efficiency of the system is greater than 87% @xcite .    with thoughtful design , the homodyne locking technique can work even with an experiment interposed between the opo and the homodyne detector . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a co - propagating local oscillator turns out to be a most useful addition to subsequent experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ unisqz](a ) in which the schematic diagram for a universal squeezer is reproduced from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , an input field is interferred with a phase - quadrature - squeezed vacuum on a beamsplitter of transmittivity @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> phase quadrature detection of one port of the beamsplitter is performed in the usual fashion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne photocurrent is amplified by @xmath23 and fed forward to the other port of the beamsplitter . </S>",
    "<S> after feed - forward , the output is a phase - quadrature squeezed version of the input , with excellent purity @xcite .    not shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ unisqz](a ) are the requirements to lock the frequency of the opo cavity and the phase of the lo . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ unisqz](b ) shows a schematic diagram for an alternative implementation . in that implementation </S>",
    "<S> , the homodyne locking technique can be used to simultaneously lock the frequency of the opo cavity and the lo phase . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram is shown with polarisation modes , but the idea could be equally well implemented using displaced beams , higher order spatial modes and so forth .    treating the input and output of the opo cavity as vector quantities , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , it is straightforward to trace the change in notation through eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ cavity-1 ] , [ alpha ] and [ squeezingsimple ] . </S>",
    "<S> we treat @xmath26 as being the desired cavity mode , and @xmath27 as an orthogonal mode in one of the degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is not resonant with the opo cavity , but it co - propagates with the former and interacts with all of the same linear optical elements . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state value of the homodyne photocurrent is @xmath28 as required to frequency - lock the opo cavity and the linearised fluctuating component of the homodyne photocurrent is as required for the universal squeezing operation @xcite when @xmath16 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a new approach to controlling the resonant frequency of a sub - threshold opo . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on direct measurement of the squeezed phase quadrature output of the opo , rather than on the traditional approach where the squeezed output is not used for frequency - locking . </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne locking technique is cheap , easy to implement and , uniquely , is a sub - quantum - noise - limited frequency discriminator . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the homodyne locking technique on a sub - threshold opo producing approximately 2db of squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown , via an explicit example , that homodyne locking remains useful when an experiment is interposed between the opo and the homodyne detector . </S>",
    "<S> indeed this approach greatly simplifies the experiment as it relieves the necessity of locking subsequent homodyne detectors .    _ </S>",
