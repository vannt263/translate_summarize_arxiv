    "the observations convince us that the universe is nowadays dominated by unidentified forms of matter , called dark matter ( dm ) , and energy , called dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the nature of dark matter convey one of the unsolved problems in physics and also dark energy is still the greatest cosmic mystery .",
    "so far , the leading particle candidate for dm focused on the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) paradigm @xcite",
    ". however , many other paradigms , including superwimps , e.g. @xcite , light gravitinos and sterile neutrinos , e.g. @xcite , are still possible to account for dm candidates .",
    "another prominent physics problem is cosmic inflation in which the universe went through a period of extremely rapid expansion .",
    "the inflationary paradigms @xcite were initially proposed to solve important issues , e.g. the magnetic monopoles , the flatness , and the horizon problems , and simultaneously provide the mechanism for generation of density perturbations as seed for the formation of large scale structure in the universe .",
    "nowadays , there is no any doubt that inflationary scenario is an indispensable ingredient of modern cosmology .",
    "its predictions fit very well with various experimental data , e.g. planck collaboration @xcite .",
    "traditionally , inflationary models were so far modelled via the introduction of new ( elementary ) scalar fields , e.g. higgs inflation @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the authors of , for example , @xcite proposed models in which inflation and dark matter can be described on the same footing .",
    "however , the elementary scalar field in field theories is plagued by the so - called hierarchy problem .",
    "this problem is commonly meant that quantum corrections generate unprotected quadratic divergences which must be fine - tuned away if the models must be true till the planck scale .",
    "one of the compelling scenarios to solve / avoid the hierarchy problem involves a composite field of some strongly coupled theories , e.g. technicolor , featuring only fermionic matter , and therefore stable with respect to quantum corrections .",
    "therefore , in order to alternatively describe nature , one can imagine that the scalar fields , e.g. the inflaton and dark matter , need not be an elementary degree of freedom .",
    "they can be considered as composite fields of some fundamental fermions , which interact with each other through some unknown forces . in the effective lagrangian description for light mesons , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl )",
    "model @xcite is a time - honored example .",
    "similar scenarios can happen at high energy scales .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite engaged the gauged njl model with inflationary machinery in slow - roll approximation .",
    "the predictions of such model are also consistent with the planck 2015 data .",
    "recent investigations also show that it is possible to construct models in which the inflaton emerges as a composite state of a four - dimensional strongly coupled theory @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a unified description of inflation and dark matter in the context of the effective njl model . in order to achieve our unified scenario",
    ", we also incorporate gravity in the njl model in which the interaction between gravitons and the fundamental fermions induce a non - minimal coupling of the composite scalar bosons @xmath8 to gravity . in analogy with the njl models for light mesons ,",
    "the bound states of the fundamental fermions can be classified into scalar channel , pseudoscalar channel and etc . , and we will use scalar channel to describe the inflaton and the pseudoscalar channel to describe the dark matter , respectively . the composite scalar field is heavy and decoupled from the low energy degrees of freedom , e.g. the standard model particles , while the pseudoscalar field , being a goldstone mode of the chiral symmetry of the fundamental fermions , is light ( massless at the chiral limit ) and connected to the low energy physics . in this sense",
    "both the pseudoscalar and the higgs field are messengers between the inflation scale and the electroweak scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec2 ] , we take a short recap of the njl model with one flavor of some fundamental fermions and then incorporate the effective model to gravity .",
    "this inherently induces a non minimal coupling of the composite scalar sectors to gravity . in sec.[sec3 ] , we demonstrate how an njl effective potential emerges and propose a cosmological scenario that unifies comic inflation and dark matter to a single framework . in the same section , we show how a conformal transformation shapes it to an inflaton - type potential .",
    "we then compute the inflationary parameters and confront them with recent planck 2015 data .",
    "we present in our model a simple connection of physics from the high scales to low scales via renormalization group equations of the physical parameters and also estimate for model of dark matter the thermally - averaged relic abundance for both the light and heavy cdm masses .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "following the usual bosonization procedure @xcite , we introduce two real scalar fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 through @xmath17 and they will be connected to the scalar channel and the pseudoscalar channel of the njl model , respectively . the scalar field @xmath15 will play the role of the inflaton and the scalar field @xmath16 will be considered as a candidate for dark matter .",
    "this is not unusual in the sense that one of the dark matter candidates , axion , is also a pseudoscalar .",
    "note that this does not mean that all dark matter come from the pseudoscalar channel . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "two majorana spinors are also introduced . however , in the present paper we will focus on these two scalar fields and leave the majorana spinors for further investigation . with the help of the field @xmath8 the njl lagrangian can be expressed as @xmath18\\ , \\psi .",

    "near the scale @xmath31 the lagrangian in ( [ njlcurved ] ) is equivalent to the njl one .",

    "as it will be shown in the renormalization group analysis , even it is set to be zero at the electroweak scale , @xmath52 will become non - vanishing at high scales .",
    "the non - minimal coupling ( [ r - phi ] ) leads to couplings of the scalars @xmath15 and @xmath16 to the ricci scalar @xmath53 note that this is different from the higgs - inflation models .",

    "although both terms are considered in ref.@xcite , they come from different sources  the inflaton comes from the higgs doublet and the dark matter scalar is included by hand , hence their couplings to the ricci scalar do not have to be the same . in our model",
    "we use one parameter @xmath48 for describing the non - minimal coupling of both inflaton @xmath15 and dark matter scalar @xmath16 to gravity , another parameter @xmath52 for the non - minimal coupling of the higgs field to gravity and @xmath54 . nevertheless ,",

    "for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that the leptons can be considered as bound states of some fundamental fermions and higgs fields ( bose - fermi mixture ) , while the pairing of the fundamental fermions leads to the dark matter .",

    "the reason resides from the fact that a nonzero value of @xmath48 is needed since for @xmath86 an unacceptably large amplitude of primordial inhomogeneities is generated for a realistic quartic higgs self - interaction term @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was found in @xcite that with @xmath48 of the order @xmath87 the model leads to successful inflation and produces the spectrum of primordial fluctuations in good agreement with the observational data .    due to the presence of the non - minimal coupling term phenomenologically introduced",

    "this allows us to rewrite the action as minimally coupled but with a new canonically normalized field .",

    "we will start quantifying the dm relic abundance by first supposing the dm is light such that @xmath225 . in this low mass case ,",
    "the decay @xmath224 is kinematically allowed , and contributes to the invisible width @xmath226 of the higgs boson .",

    "moreover , in the region above @xmath231 , the authors of ref.@xcite show that the relic density constrains the coupling as a function of the dm mass which can be approximately describe by the dependence @xmath238 . in the right panel of fig.([fig7 ] ) , we also diplay the relic abundance @xmath233 as a function of the dm mass , @xmath197 , for different values of the coupling .",

    "moreover , eq.([dmass ] ) allows us to visualize some more constraints on the parameter spaces . since @xmath239 is positive , eq.([dmass ] ) suggests a constraint @xmath240 . as a result , in fig.[fig8 ] , we have another curve of @xmath241 below which the parameters are allowed",
    ". we can be even more concrete . in order to satisfy the constraints , from fig.([fig8 ] ) in case of the light dc , we could have @xmath242 ( together with the regions above @xmath243 line ) and the cd mass in the vicinity of the resonance will survive , while in case of the heavy one the allowed couplings @xmath0 stay in between the @xmath243 line and the dot - dashed one .",
    "we finalise this section by relating the cd parameters to the njl ones and supporting for example that @xmath244 and @xmath245 . in this case , the two different momentum - cutoff schemes approach the same result : @xmath246 .",
    "interestingly , since @xmath70 is related to the njl parameters as @xmath247 we can now use the above result to incorporate the cd parameter set with the njl ones . from eq.([njlset2 ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath248 let s take for example @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "we obtain for the light cd and the heavy one , respectively @xmath251 where we have used in case of light cd @xmath252 and in case of heavy one @xmath253 .",
    "these values can be obtioned from fig.([fig6 ] ) and fig.([fig7 ] ) .",
    "hopefully , the measurement of values of @xmath254 may in principle turn out to be critical in testifying our model .",
    "note that a large value for @xmath255 can drive the value of @xmath36 to be very small , i.e. the  current \" mass of the composite fermions is extremely small compared with their dynamical mass .",
    "in this work , we presented a unified description of inflation and dark matter in the context of the effective njl model .",
    "we also demonstrated how an njl effective potential emerges and proposed a cosmological scenario that unifies comic inflation and dark matter to a single framework . on the one hand",
    ", we showed that the scalar channel of the njl model with a non - minimal coupling to gravity plays a role of the composite inflaton ( ci ) .",
    "for model of inflation , we computed the inflationary parameters and confront them with recent planck 2015 data .",
    "we discovered that the predictions of the model are in excellent agreement with the planck analysis .",
    "we presented in our model a simple connection of physics from the high scales to low scales via the renormalization group equations of the physical parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the pseudoscalar channel can be assigned as a candidate for composite dark matter ( cd ) . for model of dark matter , we coupled the pseudoscalar to the higgs sector of the standard model with the coupling strength @xmath0 and estimate its thermally - averaged relic abundance .",
    "we discovered that the cd mass is strongly sensitive to the coupling @xmath0 .",
    "we found in case of light cd , @xmath1 , that the required relic abundance is archived for value of its mass @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "however , in this case the cd mass can even be lighter when the coupling is getting larger",
    ". moreover , in case of heavy cd , @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) , the required relic abundance is archived for values of the cd mass @xmath6 for @xmath7 . in contradiction to the light mass case , however , the cd mass in this case can be heavier when the coupling is getting larger .",
    "there are some limitations in the present work  for example , the effective potential we used for computing the inflationary parameters does not include the rg - improved part as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; we have not considered any other channels than the scalar and pseudoscalar channels ; the njl description itself can be more general , say including more flavors , or including some gauge fields so it becomes a gauged njl model .",
    "moreover , a determinant term can be added to the njl action so one can take anomaly into account @xcite ; also one should complete the rges for all scales and solve them numerically .",
    "we hope to address these issues with future investigations .",
    "moreover , regarding this single framework , another crucial issue for successful models of inflation is the ( pre)reheating mechanism .",
    "we plan to investigate this mechanism , within our framework , by following one of the very recent examinations on the ( pre)reheating mechanism underlying a composite inflationary scenario @xcite .",
    "more recently , direct searches for dm by the lux and pandax - ii collaborations @xcite implementing xenon - based detectors have recently come up with the most stringent limits to date on the elastic scattering of dm off nucleons , see ref.@xcite for the very recent analysis . in the simplest model , sm+dm ,",
    "which is the standard model plus a real scalar singlet ( darkon ) acting as the dm candidate , the lux and pandax - ii limits rule out dm masses from @xmath256 to about @xmath257 , except a small triangle around the resonant point at half of the higgs mass .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable for us in the future to look at the constraints on our model not only from the most recent dm direct searches , but also from lhc measurements on the gauge and yukawa couplings of the @xmath258 higgs boson and on its invisible decay mode , as well as from some upcoming requirements .",
