    "first , we briefly introduce the essential background to topic of this paper .",
    "about one century ago , @xcite published an interesting paper titled `` in what way does it become manifest in the fundamental law of physics that space has three dimensions ? '' .",
    "this paper remains actively discussed even today ( see a paper `` dimensionality '' by @xcite ) .",
    "about 40 years ago , in quantum field theory , a method of dimensional regularization , permitting a distortion of space - time dimension @xmath17 , was proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method is equivalent to assigning an infinitesimal fictitious mass @xmath18 to a photon or introducing a large momentum cut - off @xmath19 in the momentum integration of the feynman diagram ( @xmath20 corresponds to @xmath21 or @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the mass of an electron ) .",
    "these methods are important in calculations of physical quantities such as the self - energy and the anomalous magnetic moment of electron ( and muon ) , suggesting that non - integer values of @xmath24 may have a feasible physical interpretation .    shortly after t  hooft and veltman , and their contemporaries proposed their method in 1972 , @xcite conceptualized the fractal dimension of space - time .",
    "inspired by his book , several researchers have investigated fractal dimensions in the natural sciences @xcite .",
    "a range of estimated physical quantities is summarized in table [ tab-1 ] . among these",
    ", the phase space of fractal @xmath25-dimension ( named the hausdorff dimension ) is given by @xcite based on @xcite @xmath26^{d_h}}{\\gamma ( 1+d_h/2 ) } , \\label{eq-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the gamma function , and eq .",

    "the quantities @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath3 are planck s constant , the light frequency , boltzmann s constant , speed of light , and temperature , respectively .",
    "@xcite suggested that upper limit may be placed on the distortion of space - dimension , such that @xmath37 ( note that their investigation was published eight years earlier than the nasa cobe data @xcite ) .",
    "measurements by nasa s cobe satellite revealed that our universe is almost homogenously filled with cosmic microwave radiation at 2.725 k. @xcite analyzed the @xcite data ( where firas denotes far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ) in terms of the following formula : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is assumed constant .",

    "these differences are contradicting in spite fact that both studies used the same data , a similar formulation and the cern minuit program . after recalculating our results ( listed in the third row of table [ tab1 ] ) , we are able to attribute these discrepancies to differences in the numerical values of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "second , we note that the cobe data contain two effects , namely , the chemical potential @xmath0 , and the sunyaev  zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xmath1 @xcite in the black - body radiation spectra . as a next step ,",
    "it is worthwhile to analyze the cobe data in terms of these effects , in addition to the distortion of the space - dimension @xmath2 .",
