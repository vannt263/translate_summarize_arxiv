    "the standard model predicts the dipole moment of the electron at a level of about @xmath5 @xmath4 while some variants of supersymmetric models forecast @xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite . since the supersymmetry is an important ingredient of modern physics it would be desirable to achieve the sensitivity of measurements enabling us to test these predictions . the present limit on the electron edm is @xmath6 @xcite .    the measurement of an angle of the polarization plane rotation of light when it propagates through a gas immersed in an electric field is one of the possible ways of searching the electric dipole moment of an electron .",
    "the interaction of an electric field with the electron dipole moment leads to the splitting of the atomic levels , analogous to the zeeman effect and , consequently , to the polarization plane rotation ( similar to faraday effect ) when a photon propagates along the electric field direction .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in addition to the atomic level splitting one more mechanism leading to the light polarization plane rotation exists .",
    "it is the interference of the stark and p - t- invariance violating transition amplitudes .    in a typical transmittance experiment ( fig . [ cell ] ) with a gas cell the intensity of a light beam decreases when it propagates in a medium .",
    "this restricts the length available for polarization plane rotation measurements @xcite .",
    "an idea to use a photon trap ( resonator ) with an amplifier ( fig .",
    "[ amplif ] ) to compensate light absorption was proposed in @xcite . because the trap contains exited medium",
    ", the amplification cancels the losses and light can stay in the resonator for a long time .",
    "the simplest type of the trap is a laser placed in the electric field ( fig .",
    "[ pin ] ) .",
    "this system is similar to the laser in the magnetic field considered in 70th @xcite and recently as a footing of the laser magnetometers @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty for laser magnetometery is linear anisotropy of losses of the resonator @xcite .",
    "the same difficulty is deferred on the measurements of p - t- noninvariant rotation in the electric field , because the linear anisotropy of losses of the resonator is much greater than the circular anisotropy created by the electric field provided that p- and t- invariance breaks .",
    "it should be remembered that in the absence of the linear anisotropy of losses an angle between the polarization plane of the laser radiation and some axis increases linearly with time , and the angular velocity of the polarization plane rotation is proportional to the p- t- odd polarizability of the atoms and strength of the electric field .",
    "large linear anisotropy forbids polarization plane rotation .",
    "when the electric field turns on , the polarization plane rotates for a small angle and then stops .",
    "only this angle should be measured .",
    "below we give a detailed theoretical analysis of such a photon trap for measurements of the p - t- noninvariance .",
    "let us consider a stationary electromagnetic wave in a resonator containing an exited medium possessing linear and circular anisotropy .",
    "the effect of polarization plane rotation can be described by the p- t- noninvariant term @xmath7 in the tensor of the refractive index of the medium @xcite , where @xmath8 is the completely antisymmetric tensor and @xmath9 is the external electric field .",
    "let the mirrors of the resonator be perpendicular to the @xmath10-axis , and the external electric field @xmath9 be directed along it .",
    "it is convenient to choose the reference frame providing for the matrix of anisotropic losses of the resonator to be diagonal .",
    "thus the tensor part of the generalized refractive index ( see appendix ) , which includes the resonator , has the form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 describe linear anisotropy of losses and circular phase anisotropy correspondingly .",
    "linear phase anisotropies are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "prime marks the refractive index of the exited medium to distinguish it from that for the medium in the ground state .",
    "the refractive index acts as matrix in the space of the vectors @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the components of the electric field of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "linear anisotropy of losses @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( see appendix ) . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the finesse of the resonator for the light polarized along the @xmath23 and @xmath24 axes , respectively . in principle",
    ", very low anisotropy of losses can be achieved .",
    "for instance , in the experiments @xcite the quantity @xmath25 . in our estimates",
    "we use the value of @xmath0 in a hope that the progress in the technology of unstressed materials and the resonator design will allow it to be reached .",
    "circular phase anisotropy @xmath26 is produced by the electric field if p- t- invariance is violated .",
    "linear phase anisotropies @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the refractive indexes for the wave polarized along the @xmath23-axis and @xmath24-axis , at the angle @xmath32 and at the angle @xmath33 ( relative to the @xmath23-axis ) , respectively .",
    "if one rotates the reference frame at @xmath34 , the quantity @xmath14 takes up positions on the diagonal of the refractive index matrix .",
    "however more convenient is the circular basis @xmath35 in which the refractive index takes the form : @xmath36    measurements should be performed by the analyzer placed perpendicularly to the polarization plane of the laser beam ( when the electric field is turned off ) .",
    "the orientation of the polarization plane of the laser light is determined by residual anisotropy of losses in the resonator and coincides with one of the main axes i.e. it is directed along the vector @xmath37 .    as the electric field is turned on , the circular anisotropy @xmath13 depending linearly on the electric field appears and the polarization plane rotates by the angle @xmath38 , which can be found from the eq .",
    "( [ formap ] ) given in appendix .",
    "this equation describes stationary polarization of light .",
    "the angle @xmath38 is the half of the angle between vector @xmath39 at @xmath40 , when there is no electric field and that at some @xmath13 produced by the turned on electric field . in a typical experimental situation @xmath41 .",
    "vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 in ( [ formap ] ) are @xmath44 ( we omit circular dichroism due to an electric field for simplicity ) and @xmath45 .",
    "the stationary solution for the vector @xmath39 describing polarization state of the standing electromagnetic wave according to ( [ formap ] ) has the form : @xmath46 in the first order on @xmath47 .",
    "( [ xi0 ] ) gives the angle of polarization plane rotation @xmath48    as we can see from ( [ xi0 ] ) the additional parasitic angle @xmath49 appears .",
    "however , this angle can not depend linearly on the electric field .",
    "one more additional angle ( so - called `` base angle '' @xcite ) arises due to inexact perpendicular orientation of the analyzer with respect to the polarization plane of the laser beam .",
    "the conventional experimental method implies modulation of the `` base angle '' with the frequency @xmath50 by the additional faraday element placed between laser and analyzer .",
    "the signal at the output of analyzer is proportional to the squared sum of the p - t- violating angle of rotation and the `` base angle '' .",
    "the presence of @xmath50 component in the fourier transform of the output signal is the signature of p- , t- invariance violation .",
    "let us estimate the advantage of the laser experiment compared to the light transmission experiment using a cell ( fig .",
    "[ pin ] ) .",
    "the p- , t- violating refractive index does not depend on the type of the atomic transition , i.e. it is approximately the same for the dipole electric , magnetic and strongly forbidden magnetic transitions @xcite . in the transmittance experiments with a cell the angle of rotation",
    "is usually measured for two absorption lengths , thus , it is reasonable to choose transitions with the greatest absorption length . these are magnetic dipole and strongly forbidden magnetic transitions .",
    "the angle of polarization plane rotation in a cell for the length @xmath51 is equal to ( see @xcite ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the wave number .",
    "as we have mentioned , @xmath54 in the equation ( [ phil ] ) differs from @xmath55 in the expression ( [ sng ] ) .",
    "the first quantity corresponds to a medium in the ground state and transitions happen from the ground level to the exited one whereas , in the case of the laser medium , the transitions happen from a top level to the bottom .",
    "these quantities are connected to each other by the relation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the concentration of atoms , and @xmath58 is the density of inversely populated atoms .",
    "substituting @xmath59 from ( [ inv ] ) to the equation ( [ sng ] ) one obtaines : @xmath60 in the derivation of the latter equation we have taken into account the condition of laser operation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the absorption cross section for this transition . from the equations ( [ result ] ) and ( [ phil ] ) we can see that the angle of polarization rotation in the laser is equal to the angle of rotation at the absorption length @xmath63 multiplied by @xmath64 .",
    "thus one expect to obtain @xmath65 enhancement in comparison with a layout , using a cell .",
    "let us remind that the experiment with a cell uses the strongly forbidden magnetic transition ( i.e. transition between shells with different main quantum numbers ) , therefore the real gain will only appear if the laser also operates at transitions of this type . in the laser operating at ordinary electric dipole transitions , a very low inversion of population is required to compensate absorptions in the resonator , because @xmath66 in ( [ lasf ] ) is large .",
    "the real part of the refraction index is also proportional to the inversion of population and additional suppression given by ( [ inv ] ) arises .",
    "thus , the most of the gas lasers , using @xmath67 transitions are unsuitable as a trap for measuring p - t- violation .",
    "although there are no lasers working at a strongly forbidden magnetic transition , lasers working at a magnetic dipole transition do exists .",
    "one of such example , namely , chemical iodine laser will be considered below .",
    "the p- t- odd refractive index can be expressed in terms of the p- t - odd polarizability @xmath68 of an atom : @xmath69 two mechanisms contributing to @xmath70 were considered in @xcite .",
    "the first one is the interference of stark and p - t- odd transition amplitudes .",
    "the value of @xmath70 in this case can be estimated as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the laser working frequency , corresponding to the resonator own frequency ; @xmath73 are some intermediate atomic levels , @xmath74 are the energies of the levels , @xmath75 are the components of the operator @xmath76 of the atom dipole moment ( summation on @xmath77 is implied in ( [ bmix ] ) and further ) , @xmath78 is the operator of p- t - violating interaction .",
    "we assume that @xmath79 , is the laser working transition , and @xmath80 is the ground state .",
    "the dependence of polarizability on frequency is given by a multiplier @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the frequency of transition and @xmath83 should be read as denoting the recoil line width .",
    "to take into account doppler broadening in a gas we should average the multiplier over the maxwell distribution of atom velocities . according to ref .",
    "@xcite this reduces to : @xmath84 where @xmath85 there is the doppler line width , @xmath86 is speed of light , m is an atom mass , @xmath87 is the boltzman constant , @xmath88 is the temperature , @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the detuning and @xmath91 @xmath92 , @xmath93 .    using the above averaging in ( [ bmix ] )",
    "we come to the estimate : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the typical value of the matrix element from the operator of atom dipole moment , @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is rydberg constant ) is the typical value of difference in atomic levels energies , @xmath98 is the longitudinal component of @xmath9 .",
    "the above estimate of @xmath99 is valid for all kinds of atomic transitions @xcite : electric dipole , magnetic dipole and strongly forbidden magnetic dipole .",
    "the second mechanism suggests that the p - t- odd polarizability is produced by the atomic levels splitting in the electric field due to the atomic edm .",
    "this leads to the estimates @xcite : @xmath100 for the strongly forbidden magnetic transition and @xmath101 for the magnetic dipole transition . here",
    "@xmath102 are the components of the operator of atom magnetic moment , @xmath103 is the dipole moment of the atom , which can be estimated as @xmath104 . averaging ( [ beds ] ) we obtain @xmath105 for the strongly forbidden transition and @xmath106 for the magnetic dipole transition , where @xmath107 @xcite is the fine structure constant , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 is bohr radius .",
    "sources of p- t- violation are the electron edm , edm of the nucleons , and the p - t - odd electron - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "for definiteness we consider only the first one .",
    "the matrix element of p - t- odd interaction between atomic states can be estimated as @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the atom edm is of the order of @xmath112 .",
    "the above estimation takes into account the shiff theorem stating that in nonrelativistic quantum mechanic atom edm should be zero and only relativistic effects allows it to appear @xcite .",
    "relativistic effects are given by the multiplier @xmath113 @xcite , where @xmath114 is the typical electron velocity in atom , @xmath115 is the atomic number .",
    "however , the shiff theorem does not concern the `` mixing '' mechanism , because an atom edm does not appear in it .",
    "thus we have to use two different @xmath116 to describe `` mixing '' and `` splitting '' mechanisms .",
    "unfortunately , in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the single @xmath116 with relativistic suppression for both the mechanisms . in this paper will take @xmath117 for the `` splitting '' mechanism and @xmath118 for the `` mixing '' mechanism .",
    "the absorption cross section is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the einstein coefficient of a given transition .",
    "the angle of polarization plane rotation at one absorption length @xmath121 equals @xmath122    we are coming now to the concrete systems .      for lack of laser on strongly forbidden magnetic transition",

    "one more manifestation of nonlinearity is so - called `` self - rotation '' @xcite resulting in possibility of dependence : @xmath302 for @xmath303 and @xmath304 we have : @xmath305 ( we use here the expression @xmath306 ) . taking into account that @xmath307 and @xmath308 we can see the terms @xmath309 , @xmath310 appearing in the z - components of @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "this results in rotation of the plane of polarization even in the absence of circular anisotropy .",
    "however , rotation does not depends on external electric field and can be distinguished from the p - t- noninvariant effects by modulation of the external electric field , moreover , the ellipticity @xmath313 of the laser light is extremely low .",
