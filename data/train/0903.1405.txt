    "the leftmost atom in the half row changes neighbors horizontally and only once whereas all the other atoms in the half row continue having the same neighbors .",
    "even though the dislocation can glide for a long distance , single atoms move very little and only a very small fraction of these atoms change neighbors . instead of updating neighbors during glide motion",

    "a simple example is ( [ sh3 ] ) .",
    "this model changes neighbors without updating , thereby allowing atomic half rows to glide in the y - direction .    as the applied stress becomes sufficiently large ,",
    "there appear edge dislocation loops whose burgers vectors are directed along the @xmath41 axis . gliding along other directions is not possible in this model : we would need a two - component displacement vector and a periodic function of discrete differences along the @xmath16 axis @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 controls the asymmetry of @xmath58 : @xmath60 increases , the interval over which @xmath61 increases at the expense of the interval over which the slope of @xmath62 is negative .",
    "as @xmath60 increases , the ( dimensionless ) peierls stress @xmath63 needed for a dislocation to start moving increases whereas the size of the dislocation core and its mobility both decrease @xcite used in @xcite corresponds to @xmath64 in ( [ sh3 ] ) and therefore the peierls stress in figure 2 of @xcite decreases as @xmath65 increases . ] .",
    "the value of @xmath60 can be selected so that the peierls stress calculated from ( 1 ) fits values measured in experiments or calculated using md .",
