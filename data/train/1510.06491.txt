    "in semiconductor physics , the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which is available to generate the so - called spin - orbit qubit  @xcite , provides a useful approach to manipulate the spin by electric field instead of magnetic field  @xcite , and is widely studied in the field of both spintronics  @xcite and quantum information processing  @xcite . in the low dimensional semiconductor ,",
    "there exist two types of socs , that is the rashba soc which comes from the structure inversion  @xcite and the dresselhaus soc which comes from the bulk - inversion asymmetry  @xcite . in general cases ,",
    "the two types of socs coexist in a material  @xcite .",
    "the spin properties of the electron(s ) in semiconductor have been studied widely and it shows that some novel features emerge when the soc is present . among the various properties , the ones for the ground state play crucial roles . in this paper",
    ", we study the ground state of the electron in a semiconductor quantum well , which is subject to the rashba and dresselhaus socs as well as a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian in this two - dimensional structure can be mapped onto a hamiltonian describes a qubit interacting with a single bosonic mode , where the spin degree of freedom of the electron serves as the qubit and the orbit degree of freedom serves as the bosonic mode  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the rashba soc contributes to the rotating wave interaction and the dresselhaus soc contributes to the anti - rotating wave interaction .",
    "when the strengths and/or the phases of the two types of socs are not equal to each other ( this is the usual case in realistic material ) , the mapped hamiltonian is actually an anisotropic rabi model  @xcite in quantum optics .    with the available parameters in quantum well systems , it will undergo the energy level crossing between the ground and first excited states as the increase of soc strength .",
    "this kind of energy level crossing will induce a large entanglement for the ground state , and have some potential applications in quantum information processing .",
    "also , the steady state of the system when the dissipation is present is also affected greatly by the energy level crossing .",
    "although the same form of hamiltonian ( i.e. , anisotropic rabi hamiltonian ) can also be achieved in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) systems , such a crossing would not occur since the related coupling between the bosonic mode and the qubit is too weak . in this paper , we analytically give the crossing strength of rashba soc in which the energy level crossing occurs when the dresselhaus soc is absent .",
    "furthermore , we study the crossing phenomenon numerically when both of the two kinds of socs are present .",
    "the energy level crossing behavior in our system is similar to the superradiant quantum phase transition in the dicke model  @xcite , where the quantum properties ( e.g. , the expectation of photon number in ground state ) are subject to abrupt changes when the coupling strength between the atoms and field reaches its critical value  @xcite .",
    "recently , it is found that the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) is a sensitive probe to the superradiant quantum phase transition in the dicke model  @xcite .",
    "this inspires us to investigate the relation between the qfi and energy level crossing in our system .",
    "the qfi , as a key quantity in quantum estimation theory , is introduced by extending the classical fisher information to quantum regime , and can characterize the sensitivity of a state with respect to the change of a parameter .",
    "the qfi is also related to quantum clone  @xcite , and quantum zeno dynamics  @xcite . in our system",
    ", we find that there exists an abrupt change in the qfi at the crossing point , so that the qfi can be regarded as a signature of the energy level crossing behavior in quantum well system .",
    "furthermore , the qfi increases with the increase of the dresselhaus soc . as the increase of rashba soc strength , the qfi nearly remains before the crossing but decreases monotonously after it",
    "actually , the qfi has a close connection with the entanglement  @xcite , and can be used to detect the entanglement  @xcite , so our results can be explained from the viewpoint of the entanglement and intuitively understood based on the stationary perturbation theory .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the model under consideration and map the soc hamiltonian onto an anisotropic rabi model in quantum optics . based on the mapped hamiltonian , we study in sec .",
    "[ crossing ] the energy level crossing behavior when the dresselhaus soc is on and off respectively . in sec .",
    "[ result ] , we show that the qfi of the ground state witnesses the energy level crossing , and analyse its dependence on the rashba and dresselhaus socs before and after the energy level crossing occurs . in sec .",
    "[ summary ] , we give a brief conclusion .",
    "we consider an electron with mass @xmath0 and effective mass @xmath1 moving in a two - dimensional @xmath2 plane , which is provided by a semiconductor quantum well .",
    "the electron is subject to the rashba and dresselhaus socs , and a static magnetic field in positive @xmath3 direction @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is written as  @xcite @xmath5where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the x- ( y- ) direction component of the canonical momentum @xmath8 with @xmath9 the mechanical momentum and @xmath10 the vector potential .",
    "@xmath11 is the lande factor , and @xmath12 is the bohr magneton , @xmath13 are the pauli operators . here , @xmath14 is the plank constant and @xmath15 is the electronic charge .",
    "the last term in hamiltonian  ( [ oh ] ) , representing the socs , can be divided into two terms @xmath16 , where @xmath17 the hamiltonian @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the rashba  @xcite and dresselhaus socs  @xcite term , respectively . @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are in units of velocity , describe the related strengths of the two types of socs and are determined by the geometry of the heterostructure and the external electric field across the field , respectively  @xcite .",
    "since we consider that @xmath22 is along the positive direction of @xmath3 axis , it is natural to choose the vector potential as @xmath23 . by defining the operator  @xcite @xmath24",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath25=1 $ ] , so @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) can be regarded as a bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator .    in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath28",
    ", the hamiltonian can be re - written as @xmath29    where @xmath30 , and the parameters are calculated as    @xmath31    [ para ]    thus , we have mapped the hamiltonian in quantum well with socs onto a standard anisotropic rabi model  @xcite which describes the interaction between a qubit and a single bosonic mode . here",
    "the spin and orbit degrees of freedom serve as the qubit and bosonic mode respectively . in the language of quantum optics , the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ ho ] ) are the free terms of the boson mode with eig - energy @xmath32 and the qubit with the transition energy @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the first term as well as its hermitian conjugate in the braket in eq .",
    "( [ ho ] ) represents the rotating - wave coupling with strength @xmath34 and the second term as well as its hermitian conjugate represents the anti - rotating coupling with strength @xmath35 , the relative phase between these two coupling strengths is @xmath36 [ see eq .  [ para](b ) ] .",
    "actually , such a kind of mapping from spintronics to quantum optics can also be performed when an additional harmonic potential is added to confine the spatial movement of the electron  @xcite .    in our system ,",
    "both of the bare energies of the qubit and bosonic mode as well as their coupling strength can be adjusted by changing the amplitude of the external magnetic field , so that the coupling strength can be either smaller or even ( much ) larger than the bare energies , this fact will lead to some intrinsic phenomena , such as the energy level crossing , which will be studied in detail in next section .",
    "based on the mapped anisotropic rabi hamiltonian in the above section , we will discuss the energy level crossing  @xcite in this section .",
    "firstly , we give the crossing point without the dresselhaus soc analytically , then the crossing behavior for the full hamiltonian is discussed numerically .",
    "when the dresselhaus soc is absent ( @xmath37 , then @xmath38 ) , the mapped hamiltonian reduces to the exact jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian where the excitation number is conserved .",
    "the eigen - state without excitation is @xmath39 , which represents that the orbit degree of freedom is in the bosonic vacuum state and the spin degree of freedom is in its ground state ( actually , is the spin - down state because the magnetic field is in @xmath40 direction in our consideration ) .",
    "the corresponding eigen - energy is @xmath41 . in the subspace with only one excitation , the pair of dressed states",
    "are    @xmath42 in the above equations , we have defined @xmath43 , and @xmath44    using the above results , it is shown that the ground state of the system is either the separated state @xmath45 when @xmath46 , or the entangled state @xmath47 when @xmath48 .",
    "a simple calculation gives the crossing rashba soc strength ( @xmath49 ) which separates the entangled from unentangled ( separated ) ground state as @xmath50      on the other hand , when the dresselhaus soc is present , the mapped hamiltonian yields an anisotropic rabi hamiltonian , in which the rotating - wave term and the anti - rotating - wave term coexist . in this case , the conservation of the excitation is broken , that is , @xmath51\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the analytical solution of quantum rabi model ( @xmath52 ) was originally obtained by braak  braak and was developed to the case of anisotropic rabi model ( @xmath53 )  @xcite .",
    "their results however are based on a composite transcendental function defined by power series , and are difficult to extract the fundamental physics .    to deal with the anti - rotating - wave coupling term approximately",
