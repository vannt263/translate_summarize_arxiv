    "in globular clusters ( gcs ) spectroscopic observations have revealed large ( @xmath8dex ) star - to - star abundance variations of c , n , o , na , mg and al ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "_ combined scenario _ star - to - star abundance variations of c , n , o , na , mg and al in gcs may have multiple origins : _ ( i ) _ on the ms they may be due to pollution in the past either by the massive agb stars or by somewhat more massive ( @xmath13 ) rgb stars than the present - day ms turn - off stars which had undergone deep extra - mixing , and _ ( ii ) _ on the rgb they may be partly tracers of the same pollution that occured on the ms and partly ( in the most rapidly rotating stars ) they may be due to deep extra - mixing @xcite .    in the primordial scenario massive agb stars are thought to be responsible for very low o abundances ( [ o / fe]@xmath14 , down from the assumed initial value of + 0.4 ) in ms stars in gcs by _ pollution with o - depleted material_. indeed ,",
    "@xcite have reported that , in metal - poor massive agb stars , hbb may be capable of producing the required o depletion .",
    "however , nucleosynthesis beyond the cno - cycle has not been investigated yet . in this _",

    "simultaneous , fully implicit , iterative solution of the nuclear network and time - dependent mixing equations for each isotope @xcite , and hydrodynamic overshooting with a geometric , exponential decay parameter @xmath15 can be included .",
    "we have improved the adaptive time - step and grid - allocation algorithm for the extremely metal - poor models in order to ensure that the tdu properties are not affected by numerical resolution issues .",
    "the mixing - length parameter is @xmath16 from calibrating a solar model , and @xmath17 .",
    "we choose a model of initially @xmath18 with a metallicity of @xmath4 as a representative example for ims that might have polluted gc stars of the lowest metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath19=@xmath20 ) .",
    "we evolve the initial pre - ms model through all evolutionary phases , and details will be presented in a forthcoming paper . up to the first thermal pulse on the agb ,",
    "exponential overshooting with @xmath21 has been considered at all convective boundaries .",
    "the first envelope abundance alteration occurs as a result of the second dredge - up .",
    "material processed mainly by h - shell burning is brought to the surface .",
    "@xmath2  is enhanced by @xmath22 from the conversion of the initial abundance of @xmath1and some @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath0   is depleted by @xmath24 due to the action of the on cycle .",
    "magnesium isotopes are changed by less than @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for mass numbers @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the second dredge - up .    during the tp - agb phase",
    "the interplay of the tdu and hbb alters the envelope abundances .",
    "tdu brings @xmath1  and a rather uncertain amount of @xmath0  to the surface .",
    "@xmath6  and @xmath7  are produced by two processes : _",
    "( i ) _ by hbb in the envelope ( at the expense of @xmath31 mg ) , and _",
    "( ii ) _ by @xmath32 captures on @xmath1  in the pdcz .",
    "the second process is important when the temperature in the pdcz exceeds @xmath11@xmath33k .",
    "the hbb also destroys @xmath0  ( and produces @xmath34 ) , while @xmath2  is produced by proton captures on the dredged - up @xmath1 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "@xmath2  can be destroyed again .",
    "the overall budget of the o , na and mg isotopes depends on the interplay of dredge - up and hbb .",
    "in addition , mass loss plays an important role .",
    "it limits the tp - agb evolution time with high hbb temperature and efficient third dredge - up .",
    "all of these effects can be observed in the surface abundance evolution of two tp - agb model sequences that we evolved from the same early - agb model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) . in the first sequence ( a ) we have isolated the effect of hbb by assuming no overshooting and a rather low time resolution ( typically less than 1000 models per tp cycle ) . as a result",
    ", this sequence shows no tdu ( apart from one _ outlier _ seen in the run of @xmath0  at @xmath35 ) .",
    "we have also assumed mass loss according to @xcite with @xmath36 , and the model experiences 43 tps until the envelope mass is lost .",
    "this sequence shows a large @xmath0  depletion , but due to the lack of @xmath1  dredge - up , @xmath2  is depleted as well .    in panel ( b ) a model",
    "is shown in which we have considered only negligible overshooting at the bottom of the he - flash convection zone ( @xmath37 ; the intershell abundances are not affected significantly by this very small pdcz overshoot ) . at the bottom of the envelope convection",
    "we have assumed @xmath21 , as calibrated at the ms core convection boundary .",
    "here we have used the high spatial and time resolution required to model the tdu .",
    "mass loss has been turned off for this case in order to explore the largest possible nuclear enrichment by hbb and dredge - up .",
    "after a few tp the tdu is very efficient , and it reaches into @xmath38o - rich layers below the zones previously covered by the pdcz .",
    "our models with this deep dredge - up show systematically higher hbb temperatures than the model without dredge - up .",
    "the unusually deep dredge - up is likely related to the effect of sustained , fierce h - burning in the overshoot layer .",
    "we will discuss the details of this effect , which is unique to very metal poor ims , in a forthcoming paper .",
    "for the present study it is sufficient to note that the tdu in these stars could be much more efficient than previous models without overshooting indicated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that oxygen could be enhanced by this process .",
    "this undermines the ability of hbb to deplete oxygen in the envelope .",
    "however , with efficient tdu , @xmath1  is dredged - up and @xmath2  is , in fact , further increased .",
    "the behaviour of the magnesium isotopes is qualitatively the same as in the model without dredge - up , indicating that these species are mainly affected by the hbb .",
    "according to our high - resolution , full stellar evolution models with efficient tdu , massive agb stars _ can not _ show simultaneously @xmath38o depletion and na enhancement . using parametric models we will now explore intermediate cases with @xmath1  dredge - up but limited @xmath0  dredge - up , and we will consider in more detail the evolution of magnesium isotopes .",
    "we have developed a parametric nucleosynthesis and mixing code for massive agb stars .",
    "all processes that are relevant for the abundance evolution of o , na , and the mg isotopes are considered . in particular , we include the effects of hbb and dredge - up , as well as mixing and burning in the pdcz .",
    "most reaction rates are taken from the nacre @xcite compilation ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "for the initial conditions we assume scaled solar abundances except for an enhancement of the @xmath32-elements ( @xmath38o , @xmath39ne , @xmath31 mg , etc . ) by @xmath40dex , and a depletion of na and al by the same factor , in accordance with the chemical composition of the halo dwarfs . as in the full stellar models ,",
    "the metallicity is @xmath4 . in the following description ,",
    "we use the subscripts `` pdcz '' , `` hbs '' and `` hbb '' to indicate the temperatures and densities at the base of the pdcz , in the h - burning shell and at the bottom of the convective envelope , respectively .",
    "a tp sequence starts with a calculation of the mixing and nucleosynthesis in the pdcz .",
    "the pre - tp composition of the intershell zone is a mixture consisting of a fraction @xmath41 of material from the preceding pdcz and a fraction @xmath42 containing h - shell ashes .",
    "for the first tp we take @xmath43 .",
    "the mass @xmath44 of the pdcz is divided into 25 zones with the temperature and density decreasing linearly from @xmath45 and @xmath46 at its bottom to @xmath47 and @xmath48 at its top . for the mixing in the pdcz , which is treated as a diffusion process , we assume a constant coefficient @xmath49@xmath50s@xmath51 .",
    "for the temperature @xmath45 we choose the maximum value observed in the full stellar models .",
    "for that reason we are really modeling only the high - temperature phase of the pdcz .",
    "the he - burning is stopped every time when the mass fraction abundance of @xmath52c in the pdcz has reached the value 0.23 , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "after that a fraction @xmath53 of the total mass @xmath44 of material with the final abundances from the pdcz is added to the envelope to simulate the effect of the tdu .",
    "then , we follow the changes of the envelope composition due to the hbb during the interpulse period @xmath54 . for this , we process the envelope abundance distribution after the tdu in one zone at constant @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( a dimensionless factor @xmath57 accounts for the fact that , after averaging over the mass of the convective envelope , coefficients in the nuclear kinetics network can be written in a form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a reaction rate at a temperature @xmath60 and @xmath61dx$ ] with @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; the full stellar evolution models give @xmath64 , which means that hbb takes place in a narrow zone adjacent to the base of the convective envelope ) .",
    "in addition to the hbb computation , we calculate the abundance distribution of the h - burning ashes from the new post - hbb envelope composition with another one - zone model at h - shell temperature and density .",
    "this whole sequence is repeated for eight tp cycles .",
    "we use the following structure parameters from the full models : the co - core mass @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67k , @xmath68g@xmath69 , @xmath70k , @xmath71g@xmath69 , @xmath72k , @xmath73g@xmath69 , and @xmath74yr .",
    "our test calculations have shown that the envelope abundances depend weakly on the parameter @xmath41 for a wide range of @xmath75 . therefore , its value was kept constant at @xmath76 , as given by the full stellar evolution calculations .",
    "the efficiency of nuclear processing of the envelope material in the hbb is determined by 3 parameters : @xmath54 , @xmath56 and @xmath77 . however , while the efficiency is linearly proportional to the first two of them , it depends on a high power of @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , in our model only the third parameter characterizes the efficiency of hbb .",
    "the envelope abundances are also strongly affected by the efficiency of the tdu ( parameter @xmath53 ) . in the full stellar evolution models",
    "@xmath53 depends critically on the efficiency of convection induced extra - mixing , while @xmath77 depends on the efficiency of convective energy transport in the envelope . in our parametric model @xmath53 and @xmath77 are free parameters .",
    "parametric calculations were carried out for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . the time evolution of the envelope abundances ( fig .  [ fig : f1]c ) resembles the main features seen in the results of the full stellar evolution calculations : the dredge - up of @xmath81ne , production and destruction of na via @xmath82na(p,@xmath83ne and @xmath82na(p,@xmath84 mg , depletion of @xmath5  and production of @xmath6  and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath0  is depleted just by hbb . in our standard parametric model",
    "we assume that 2% of the @xmath38o mass fraction is dredged - up from the co ",
    "core during every tp , in agreement with the average _ minimum _ predicted by the full stellar models . in the parametric model",
    "the @xmath38o abundance becomes significantly depleted with @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "thus , if no or very little @xmath38o is brought to the surface , then we confirm the findings of @xcite that @xmath38o is efficiently destroyed by the hbb in the metal - poor massive agb stars .",
    "however , our parametric models confirm the result of the full models that high hbb temperatures do not favour na production which would be required to explain the o  na anti - correlation in gc stars in the primordial scenario . indeed , at @xmath88k , the sum of the rates of the reactions @xmath82na(p,@xmath83ne and @xmath82na(p,@xmath84 mg is @xmath116.8 times as large as that of @xmath38o(p,@xmath89f , the lower and upper limits of this ratio being 2.1 and 45 , respectively ( @xcite ) . without the @xmath1  dredge - up source which replenishes",
    "na ( as in our first full stellar evolution model ) , the o depletion is accompanied by na destruction at @xmath90 .",
    "but even with the dredge - up of @xmath81ne , the final na abundance in the envelope is found to be very sensitive to small variations of @xmath77 : increasing @xmath77 from @xmath91k to @xmath92k turns the na production into the na destruction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , for high hbb temperatures , both o and na may be depleted simultaneously , resulting in o ",
    "na correlation instead of the o  na anti - correlation .",
    "if dredge - up of @xmath0  is as efficient as predicted by the high - resolution full stellar models with hydrodynamic overshooting , the temperatures for efficient @xmath38o depletion would definitively be too high for na production .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have recommended to use a rate of the reaction @xmath81ne(p,@xmath93na which is by a factor of @xmath11@xmath94 smaller than the value given by nacre at @xmath88k .",
    "this makes na production in massive agb stars even more problematic . on the other hand , a rate of the reaction @xmath81ne(p,@xmath93na from @xcite , used in ",
    "[ sec : fullse ] , is by a factor of @xmath11@xmath95 larger than the nacre value , which favours na production . in summary",
    ", we can not entirely rule out that contamination by massive agb stars causes the o  na",
    "anti - correlation in the primordial scenario . however , this seems to be very unlikely because it requires a fine tuning of the agb model parameters .",
    "this is not supported by the latest rate of the reaction @xmath81ne(p,@xmath93na either .",
    "a very robust prediction of the primordial scenario can be made with respect to the magnesium isotopes .",
    "for temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath55@xmath96@xmath97k , that allow @xmath0  depletion , the @xmath31 mg abundance is depleted in any case even more , producing @xmath6  and @xmath7  in turn .",
    "this result is consistently found in all of our models for a wide range of parameters .",
    "the evolution of @xmath5  in relation to @xmath0  is a robust result because : _ ( i ) _ at @xmath60=@xmath97k , the ratio of the @xmath31mg(p,@xmath98al rate to the @xmath38o(p,@xmath89f rate is @xmath99 , the lower and upper limits being 3.9 and 13 ( @xcite ) , and _ ( ii ) _ there is no source of @xmath31 mg in agb stars ( production of @xmath31 mg in the reaction @xmath82na(p,@xmath84 mg in the hbb is unimportant ) .",
    "therefore , in the primordial scenario with massive agb stars as the contaminators , the ms turn - off stars with [ o / fe]@xmath14 _ must _ have @xmath31 mg depleted and @xmath12 mg enhanced by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "our assumed initial chemical composition has [ o / fe]=0.4 , [ @xmath31mg / fe]=0.4 , [ @xmath12mg / fe]=0.0 and [ @xmath100mg / fe]=0.0 , i.e. the mg isotopic ratios @xmath31mg:@xmath12mg:@xmath100 mg = 90.5:4.5:5.0 .",
    "according to those models in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] with significant o - depletion , material released by massive agb stars may have @xmath101 and 0.5 for o , @xmath31 mg , @xmath12 mg and @xmath100 mg ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] the label @xmath100 mg represents the sum of @xmath100 mg and @xmath100al ) . in low - mass rgb stars in the primordial scenario",
    ", @xmath1190% of the mass of the convective envelope has to consist of this material .",
    "accordingly , on the upper rgb , such a star would have [ o / fe]=@xmath102 , [ @xmath31mg / fe]=@xmath103 , [ @xmath12mg / fe]=1.2 , [ @xmath100mg / fe]=0.5 , and the mg isotopic ratios @xmath31mg:@xmath12mg:@xmath100 mg = 13:71:16 .",
    "these predictions seem to be in conflict with the results of mg isotopic composition analysis of rgb stars in the gc ngc  6752 reported by @xcite . in the least polluted stars these authors infer @xmath31mg:@xmath12mg:@xmath100mg@xmath9680:10:10 and [ o / fe]@xmath960.6 while in the most contaminated stars they find @xmath31mg:@xmath12mg:@xmath100mg@xmath9660:10:30 and [ o / fe]@xmath104 .",
    "thus , despite having o depleted by a factor of @xmath115 , the ngc  6752 red giants still exhibit the @xmath31 mg dominated isotopic ratios .",
    "moreover , the second most abundant isotope is @xmath100 mg instead of @xmath12 mg .",
    "we see only two possibilities to remove this disagreement within the primordial scenario : either _",
    "( i ) _ the ratio of the reaction rates of @xmath31mg(p,@xmath98al and @xmath38o(p,@xmath89f at @xmath105k is much less than the value given by @xcite , and at the same time the reaction @xmath12mg(p,@xmath106al is faster ; or _",
    "( ii ) _ the hbb temperature in massive metal - poor agb stars is somewhat lower than @xmath97k , in which case the @xmath31 mg destruction would be suppressed ( see the open circles in fig .  [",
    "fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "however , in the second case , @xmath38o destruction would be suppressed as well , and @xmath12 mg ( and not @xmath100 mg ) could still be produced in a large amount .",
    "therefore , we would need deep extra - mixing on the rgb to deplete o and to produce @xmath100 mg and probably al ( either in the form of @xmath107al or @xmath100al@xmath108 ) at the expense of @xmath12 mg .",
    "this is exactly the combined scenario proposed by @xcite , with the minor modification that deep extra - mixing in the rgb stars slightly more massive than the present - day ms turn - off stars in gcs might have contributed to the star - to - star abundance variations as well .",
    "we are grateful to the referee dr . santi cassisi for several thoughtful comments and suggestions that have served to improve this paper .",
    "we appreciate the support from d. a. vandenberg through his operating grant from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ."
