    "at high temperatures or high baryon number density , quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) describes a world of weakly interacting quarks and gluons very different from the hadronic world in which we live .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a phase transition as the temperature or density is increased in which there is a transition from a state of matter where quarks are confined inside hadrons to one where quarks are free to move around ( _ deconfined _ ) within a large volume - the _ quark gluon plasma _ ( qgp ) .",
    "this can be addressed through experimental studies involving relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "experimental searches have focused on isolating signatures of two types of phase transitions which might occur in extremely hot and/or dense nuclear matter .",
    "one is related to the deconfinement of quarks while the other is related to chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "there is also an interesting possibility of the existence of a _ tri - critical _ point in the phase diagram  @xcite , where the transition changes from first to second order . at the tri - critical point",
    ", one would observe singularities in several thermodynamical variables , such as the specific heat and matter compressibility .",
    "the thermodynamical variables are related to event - by - event fluctuations in experimental observables like particle multiplicity , transverse energy , and mean transverse momentum .",
    "for example , the total heat capacity is related to transverse momentum fluctuations and matter compressibility to multiplicity fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "hence the existence of the tri - critical point can be probed in an experiment by varying the control parameters of the reaction ( impact parameter , rapidity acceptance , beam energy , and system size ) and studying the event - by - event fluctuations in the global observables .",
    "it is also believed that in high energy heavy - ion collisions there is a possibility of creating a chiral symmetry restored phase .",
    "one of the possible interesting consequences of chiral symmetry restoration , is the formation of _ disoriented chiral condensates _ ( dcc )  @xcite .",
    "the detection and study of a dcc state is expected to provide valuable information about the chiral phase transition and vacuum structure of strong interactions .",
    "the probability distribution of the neutral pion fraction in a dcc domain follows the relation  : @xmath0 since the majority of charged particles consist of charged pions and majority of photons originate from @xmath1 decays , dcc formation in a given domain would be associated with large correlated event - by - event fluctuations in the multiplicities of charged particles and photons .",
    "here we present the experimental results of multiplicity fluctuations and correlations in relativistic heavy - ion ( pb+pb ) collisions as measured by the wa98 experiment  @xcite at the cern sps .",
    "recently , much theoretical interest has been generated on the subject of event - by - event fluctuations , primarily motivated by the nearly perfect gaussian distributions of several observables ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) for a fixed centrality bin  @xcite .",
    "one may define the relative fluctuation as , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the variance of the distribution .",
    "the fluctuation is then studied by varying the control parameters of the reaction , such as the centrality and rapidity acceptance .    the wa98 experiment at the cern sps has carried out a detailed analysis of photon and charged particle multiplicity  @xcite fluctuations .",
    "the photon multiplicity is measured using the photon multiplicity detector ( pmd )  @xcite which has the pseudo - rapidity coverage from 2.9 to 4.2 .",
    "the charged particle multiplicity is obtained from the silicon pad multiplicity detector ( spmd )  @xcite with pseudo - rapidity coverage from 2.35 to 3.75 .",
    "the centrality of the reaction is defined through the measurement of transverse energy ( @xmath4 ) with the mid - rapidity calorimeter ( mirac ) having a pseudo - rapidity coverage from 3.5 to 5.5 .",
    "it is very important to control the centrality selection carefully in fluctuation studies so that the impact parameter fluctuations are kept to a minimum and the distributions are good gaussians . with this in mind",
    "we have used narrow centrality selections with bin widths of 2% in cross section , as determined from the measured total transverse energy , such as , 0 - 2% , 2 - 4% , 4 - 6% , 6 - 8% , etc .",
