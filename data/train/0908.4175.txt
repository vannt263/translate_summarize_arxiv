    "the samples were irradiated in the central irradiation facility of the triga mark ii reactor in vienna at a power of 250kw ( thermal / fast neutron flux density : @xmath14 ) .",
    "the samples were sealed into a quartz tube to avoid contact between the samples and the cooling water in the reactor .",
    "the quartz tubes were put into aluminium containers , which were filled with water and placed at the correct irradiation position .",
    "the temperature during irradiation did not exceed 60 @xmath15c .",
    "all fluences refer to fast neutrons ( @xmath16mev ) , the corresponding thermal neutron fluences ( @xmath17ev ) were smaller by a factor of 1.27 @xcite .",
    "neutron irradiation creates a wide spectrum of defects in the superconductor by elastic collisions of the neutrons with the atoms . depending on the kinetic energy transferred from the neutron to the primary recoil atom , point defects or larger defect structures appear . in an avalanche like process a huge number of atoms",
    "can be displaced , leading to local melting of the crystal lattice .",
    "the result is a spherical region of amorphous material with a mean diameter of about 3 to 6 nm @xcite . while fast neutrons ( @xmath16mev ) transfer sufficient energy to the primary recoil atom to produce collision cascades , thermal neutrons ( @xmath18ev ) do not lead to defects in the material because their energy is below the displacement threshold .",
    "epithermal neutrons ( in the kev range ) lead to the formation of point defects and point defect clusters .",
    "the density of collision cascades after irradiation to @xmath6m@xmath5 is about@xcite @xmath19m@xmath20 , which corresponds to a mean distance between two cascades of 27 nm , the lattice parameter of the flux line lattice at 3.2 t .",

    "the irreversibility fields ( @xmath23 ) of the pldysz and mocvdmgo samples are nearly identical and higher than those of the modrab sample .",

    "the pldysz and mocvdmgo samples behave almost identically , the irreversibility fields of the modrab samples are lower ( except near @xmath11 ) , but shift close to the values of the other samples after irradiation to 10@xmath24m@xmath5 .",
    "the latter do not change significantly in the accessible field range , since the moderate decrease in @xmath11 , which somewhat decreases @xmath25  at high temperatures , is counterbalanced by a slight steepening of the irreversibility line .",
    "we note that neutron irradiation can not improve the irreversibility line of state - of - the - art coated conductors and that all samples behave similarly after irradiation .",
    "it seems that the modrab samples have a comparatively low density of pinning efficient defects , which is increased by the irradiation , thus enhancing @xmath25 .",
    "the irreversibility line becomes quite insensitive to the defect concentration at high defect densities , which could indicate an upper limit for @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the irradiation has no beneficial effect on the irreversibility line for the other main field orientation ( @xmath26 ) and we observe no significant effect ( modrab ) or a slight degradation ( other samples ) .",
    "the variation of the intrinsic pinning potential is on the length scale of the c - axis lattice parameter ( equivalent to a very high density of pinning centers ) and presumably much more efficient than the cascades due to its correlated two dimensional character .",
    "neutron irradiation enhances the critical current densities in a large field and temperature range , but decreases them at low fields or close to @xmath11 .",

    "[ fig : jc ] for both main field orientations .",
    "the critical currents decrease at low magnetic fields after irradiation , which is discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "@xmath0@xmath27 becomes flatter after the irradiation at low and intermediate fields , which leads to a crossover and an enhancement at intermediate and high fields .",
    "the flattening manifests itself in a smaller exponent @xmath28 of the power - law @xmath29 , which is a reasonable approximation for the field dependence of @xmath0  at intermediate fields .",
    "note that the crossover field between the enhancement and degradation of @xmath0  is generally higher for the field parallel to the ab planes ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : jc ] ) , where an enhancement is found only at high fields and low temperatures .",
    "the currents degrade in the whole field range at 77k .",
    "the ( relative ) enhancement is more pronounced at low temperatures for both orientations , which is in contrast to earlier findings on single crystals @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the competition between pinning and thermal energy , which reduces the efficiency of comparatively small defects at high temperatures .",
    "the collision cascades are obviously the largest pinning centers in single crystals , but this does not seem to be the case in coated conductors , where a large number and variety of linear and planar defects exists @xcite , which are more efficient than the cascades at high temperatures .",
    "in addition , neutron irradiation also introduces smaller defects , which are efficient only at low temperatures .",
    "the other types of samples ( pldysz , mocvdmgo ) behave qualitatively similarly but data are available only for a fluence of @xmath7m@xmath5 so far .",
    "a similar reduction of @xmath0  at low fields turns to an enhancement at comparable crossover fields , which hardly depend on the neutron fluence ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : crossover ] ) .",
    "the field dependence becomes again weaker at intermediate field , which reduces @xmath28 . only at high fields ,",
    "the hardly changed irreversibility field causes a difference to the modrab samples .",
    "while the relative enhancement diverges for @xmath23 at the originally lower irreversibility fields in the modrab samples , the @xmath0(@xmath30 ) curves merge again near the hardly changed irreversibility fields in the pldsz and mocvdmgo samples . at high temperatures , where the irreversibility field is slightly reduced due to the decrease of @xmath11 , even a second crossover is observed , and @xmath0  is only enhanced at intermediate fields .",
    "the crossover in the field dependence @xmath31 between the unirradiated state and the irradiated state ( fig .  [ fig : crossover ] ) , is a feature that is generally observed on conductors grown by physical as well as chemical deposition .",
    "the twofold effect of the irradiation on the current transport indicates that two regimes must be separated : a high field region ( ) which benefits from the additional pinning centres and a low field domain , where a different mechanism causes a @xmath0-depression .",
    "crossover in @xmath31 between the irradiated and the unirradiated state after sequential irradiation ( sample modrab).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this is explained by considering the specific nature of current transport in a granular medium , i.e. , the critical current density in the grains @xmath32 has to be distinguished from the grain boundary critical current density @xmath33 flowing across the sample .",
    "numerous experiments on bicrystals @xcite showed that , depending on the grain boundary misorientation angle , the current transport is controlled by @xmath33 at low fields , whereas at fields in the tesla range @xmath32 limits the current transport . although it is not fully established that the behaviour of a single well - defined grain boundary is representative for the complex grain boundary network of a coated conductor @xcite , the current limitation by the grains and an increase of @xmath32 after irradiation are straightforward explanations for the observed @xmath0 improvement in high fields .",
    "further evidence for this scenario is provided by neutron irradiation of ybco thin films grown on single - crystalline substrates , which can be regarded as single macroscopic grains and thus serve as a model system for the individual microscopic grains in a coated conductor .",
    "these films show , in agreement with the above assumption of an increase in @xmath32 , enhanced critical current densities in the entire field range ( cf .",
    "[ fig : single_poly]a and reference  ) , if the temperature is not too close to the superconducting transition temperature , i.e. , when the ( moderate ) reduction of @xmath11 after irradiation is negligible .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0 decrease occurs at rather low fields , where @xmath33 is dominant in the bicrystal experiments , suggests that the grain boundary network is responsible for this effect .",
    "two different but not mutually exclusive mechanisms are able to explain the reduction of @xmath33 . first , it is important to notice , that the density of the irradiation defects is too low to reduce the cross - section for current transport significantly .",
    "but the defects are mobile during the irradiation and the grain boundaries represent natural barriers for their movement , which causes the defects to accumulate  the grain boundaries deteriorate after irradiation .",
    "this effect has , however , only an impact on the overall @xmath0 , if the current transport is limited by the grain boundaries .",
    "hence , the crossover indicates the transition between the low field regime , which is dominated by the grain boundary network , and the high - field regime controlled by the properties of the grains .",
    "comparison of the effect of neutron irradiation on samples grown on single - crystalline ( a ) and poly - crystalline ( b ) substrates .",
    "the critical current density in the single - crystalline sample is enhanced in the entire field range , while the granular sample exhibits a crossover at about the same field as state - of - the - art coated conductors .",
    "the inset shows that the remnant moment of the granular sample decreases when the grain boundary currents are saturated and the flux penetrates the grains .",
    "( data are normalised to the unirradiated state.),title=\"fig : \" ] comparison of the effect of neutron irradiation on samples grown on single - crystalline ( a ) and poly - crystalline ( b ) substrates .",
    "the critical current density in the single - crystalline sample is enhanced in the entire field range , while the granular sample exhibits a crossover at about the same field as state - of - the - art coated conductors .",
    "the inset shows that the remnant moment of the granular sample decreases when the grain boundary currents are saturated and the flux penetrates the grains .",
    "( data are normalised to the unirradiated state.),title=\"fig : \" ]    another explanation for the @xmath0 reduction at low fields is based on the field exerted by the intra - granular shielding currents on the grain boundaries : if @xmath32 is larger than @xmath33 , additional flux remains trapped in the grains after a change of the external applied field and the circulating currents in the grain generate an additional field at the grain boundaries .",
    "thus , the enhancement of @xmath32 by the irradiation , which is responsible for the @xmath0 improvement at high fields , increases the grain boundary field and thereby reduces the field dependent @xmath33 at low applied fields .",
    "an experimental test is provided by a method similar to ref .  , where the remnant magnetic moment @xmath34 of the sample is assessed after applying successively larger fields @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath33 is smaller than @xmath32 , flux will initially penetrate along the grain boundaries .",
    "after the grain boundary network has saturated and additional flux is trapped only in the grains , @xmath36 decreases as the intra - grain currents increase the field at the grain boundary .",
    "is not significant , because @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radius , which is a few millimetres for the sample and more than a hundred times less for a single grain .",
    "thus , the dominating component of the total magnetic moment stems from the currents flowing across the grain boundaries in all samples expect those with high - angle grain boundaries , which makes a direct assessment of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( as for example in ref .  ) impossible . ]",
    "the expected behaviour of @xmath36 is clearly evident in samples grown at an early stage of optimisation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : single_poly]b ) to the granular substrate and thus carry a rather low @xmath33 @xcite . despite the smaller @xmath0 of this sample ,",
    "the crossover occurs at fields comparable to state - of - the - art coated conductors .",
    "although the two proposed mechanisms are different , they do not exclude each other , but rely on the same argument : a transition between grain boundary to grain controlled current transport leading to a crossover in @xmath31 between the irradiated and the unirradiated state .",
    "it should further be noted that the complexity of the grain boundary network does not allow to draw clear distinctions and the crossover indicates only approximately the transition from one regime to the other .",
    "the irradiation reduces the @xmath0- anisotropy ( sample modrab ) .",
    "the minimum in @xmath0  appears near 9@xmath15 , where the currents are hardly changed by the introduced defects.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the angular dependence of the critical current in the modrab sample at 64k and 3 t is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : angamsc ] .",
    "the pronounced peak at 0@xmath15 either comes from intrinsic pinning by the periodic variation of the order parameter along the c - axis , or from correlated defects , such as stacking faults .",
    "there is hardly any trace of a peak at 90@xmath15 in the unirradiated tape .",
    "this indicates that the density of c - axis correlated defects is small .",
    "the random , uncorrelated disorder introduced by the neutrons reduces the @xmath39-anisotropy , @xmath40 , from 2.7 to 1.3 at a fluence of @xmath6m@xmath5 .",
    "the latter is considerably smaller than the @xmath39-anisotropy in a thin film with a claimed ( intrinsic or effective ) anisotropy of only@xcite 1.5 , obtained by a scaling analysis @xmath0(@xmath41 ) @xcite on the basis of the ansiotropic scaling approach by blatter et al .",
    "@xcite such a small intrinsic anisotropy can be excluded in the present sample , since the anisotropy of the irreversibility fields is much higher and not significantly altered by the irradiation .",
    "the shape of @xmath0(@xmath41 ) in the irradiated state is extremely interesting .",
    "the peak at 0@xmath15 is followed by a minimum at about 9@xmath15 and another broad maximum centered at around @xmath42 .",
    "note that this behaviour was induced by the addition of random , uncorrelated disorder and is hardly compatible with the anisotropic scaling approach , although this model assumes such a defect structure , but with weak instead of strong pinning defects .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the scaling of @xmath0  is based on single - vortex weak - collective pinning @xcite which predicts extremely small currents and is obviously not applicable to `` high-@xmath0 '' coated conductors .",
    "the peak at 90@xmath15 indicates the presence of c - axis correlated defects in the mocvdmgo sample .",
    "it disappears after neutron irradiation , the minimum at @xmath43 is amplified.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the mocvdmgo samples contain c - axis correlated defects , as indicated by the peak at around 90@xmath15 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angsp ] .",
    "this peak disappears after irradiation and the currents hardly change between 25@xmath15 and 90@xmath15 at 64k and 4 t , in contradiction to the anisotropic scaling approach .",
    "the minimum , again at about 9@xmath15 , which was present in these samples also before irradition , is amplified . only the intrinsic pinning remains practically unaffected .    at higher fields ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angsp ] ) , a minimum occurs at 90@xmath15 , which is an obvious consequence of the small irreversibility field in this orientation .",
    "the ratio of the irreversiblity fields in the main field orientations is consistent with anisotropic scaling and with expectations for the intrinsic anisotropy ( @xmath44 ) and seems to represent a much more reliable estimate for the intrinsic anisotropy ( the scaling of fields is independent of pinning models ) than the angular dependence of @xmath0 , since this approach does not work for the relevant pinning centers in coated conductors .",
    "commercial state - of - the - art conductors fulfill the requirements of fusion magnets on @xmath0  at 64k , a temperature , where liquid nitrogen ( at low pressure ) can be used as coolant , if the magnetic field is parallel to the ab planes . for the other main field orientation as well as at 77k",
    "the performance is still too low.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    powerful magnets will be needed to confine the plasma of future fusion power plants .",
    "the use of high temperature superconductors instead of nb@xmath2sn would allow operation at higher temperatures and/or fields , which would reduce the cooling requirements and could also result in a more compact and cheaper design .",
    "however , only first concepts for fusion magnets made of coated conductors are being developed at present .",
    "cables with a current capability in the ten ka range are needed and the strands have to be somehow twisted @xcite in order to reduce ac losses . electrical , mechanical , and thermal stabilization of such wires and",
    "quench detection / protection will be demanding issues .",
    "apart from these technological issues , the superconducting properties have to fulfill two basic requirements .",
    "the critical current densities must be comparatively high , since the superconducting volume fraction of a coated conductor is low ( typically 1 - 2% ) and they must not degrade during operation in a hard radiation environment ( fast neutrons ) .",
    "a rough estimate of the required intrinsic critical current density leads to about @xmath45am@xmath5 ( @xmath46am@xmath5 ) at about 12 t ( 14 t ) @xcite , assuming the overall current density of the actual iter ( demo ) cable design for the toroidal field ( tf ) coils or the central solenoid ( cs ) .",
    "these values are certainly achievable with present conductors , but define the operation temperature . cooling with liquid nitrogen would be favorable , but is possible only above 64k ( at low pressure ) . figure  [ fig : fusion ] demonstrates that this seems feasible ( although not at 77k ) with present conductors ( mocvdmgo ) if the field is aligned with the ab planes .",
    "the magnetic field in the fusion coils will be close to this orientation , but , depending on the cable and coil design , orthogonal components will occur . in the other limiting case ( @xmath23 )",
    ", the performance currently fails significantly . since the currents drop quickly at small misalignment angles ( figs .",
    "[ fig : angamsc ] and [ fig : angsp ] ) , further conductor development seems mandatory in order to reach the required current densities at these high temperatures .",
    "the field in the poloidal field ( pf ) coils is much smaller ( up to about 6 t in iter and 9 t in demo ) , which is also highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fusion ] .",
    "even these requirements seem to be demanding at 77k or for @xmath23 .",
    "the expected life time fluence ( fast neutrons ) at the main fusion magnets ( pf , cs ) is around @xmath47m@xmath5 and might be even higher in future fusion power plants .",
    "since the currents at 77k already degrade at a fluence of @xmath6m@xmath5 , radiation resistance is an important issue for the application of coated conductors in fusion magnets , at least at elevated temperatures .",
    "the influence of fast neutron irradiation on differently fabricated coated conductors was found to be similar .",
    "the critical currents decrease at low magnetic fields , where inter - granular currents set the upper limit for loss free current flow .",
    "this decrease can be understood either by a slight degradation of the grain boundaries , or by the increasing shielding currents within the grains , which generate an additional field at the grain boundaries .",
    "the irradiation enhances @xmath0  at intermediate and high magnetic fields , where the macroscopic current is limited by pinning , which is improved by the additional pinning centers .",
    "although these pinning centers are uncorrelated , the angular dependence of @xmath0does not obey anisotropic scaling .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the pinning strength of these defects , which can not be considered as weak , as assumed in the scaling approach .",
    "since this should be true for any relevant pinning centers in these `` high-@xmath0 '' conductors , anisotropic scaling based on weak collective single vortex pinning is not applicable .",
