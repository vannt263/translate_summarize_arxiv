    "the measured dijet cross sections fall by two orders of magnitude over the @xmath7 range considered here .",
    "the nlo qcd predictions agree with the data to within 10@xmath87 when the renormalisation scale @xmath19 is chosen to be @xmath144 .",
    "the estimated theoretical uncertainties of up to @xmath160 for @xmath161 gev@xmath3 arise from the absence of higher - order terms , leading to a sensitivity on the choice of the renormalisation scale . only for @xmath97 200 gev@xmath3 are the theoretical uncertainties comparable to the systematic uncertainties of the data .",
    "the nlo predictions agree with the measured @xmath151 and @xmath46 distributions to within 10@xmath87 .",
    "again , for these distributions , the renormalisation - scale uncertainty is large ; up to 40@xmath87 when @xmath162 and 50@xmath87 when @xmath163 .    at low @xmath7 ,",
    "the uncertainty on the measurements is similar to the difference between the predictions using the cteq4 m and mbfit1 m parametrisations of the proton pdfs . in the range @xmath157  gev@xmath3",
    ", the total experimental uncertainty of the measurement ranges from @xmath158 and the theoretical uncertainty , due to the variation of @xmath28 , varies from @xmath159 to @xmath93 . within these uncertainties ,",
    "the measurements are consistent with a qcd prediction based on a gluon distribution extracted from scaling violations of the @xmath164 structure function of the proton . in this sense , therefore , these measurements are consistent with a universal gluon pdf",
    ". however , the large theoretical uncertainty precludes a useful determination of the gluon pdf in the proton using the dijet data ; improved calculations are needed to exploit the full potential of this data .",
    "the design , construction and installation of the zeus detector have been made possible by the ingenuity and dedicated efforts of many people from inside desy and from the home institutes who are not listed as authors .",
