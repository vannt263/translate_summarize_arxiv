    "many properties of atomic nuclei are essentially governed by pairing interactions . here and below we call  pairing \" the part of residual interaction which scatters the particles between the pairs of time - conjugate single - particle orbits .",
    "the isoscalar pairing , which may be important for @xmath0 nuclei far from stability , will not be discussed here ( at a single spherical @xmath1-level such @xmath2 pairing would require pairs with @xmath3 ) , although it also can be studied in a similar manner .",
    "pairing is often viewed as a simple and the most regular part of the nuclear interaction . in a low - lying region of the spectrum it forms a pair condensate which strongly influences all nuclear properties @xcite . according to the standard bcs description borrowed from the macroscopic theory of superconductivity , the excitation of the system breaks pairs removing them from the interaction domain and blocking the scattering phase space for remaining pairs .",
    "another , collective mode of excitation implies the redistribution of the pairs with no breaking . as a result ,",
    "coherent pair vibrations of the condensate are possible . at some excitation energy ( or temperature ) there occurs a sharp second order phase transition to a normal heated fermi - liquid where the pairing effects are usually neglected , again in the spirit of the bcs theory of macroscopic superconductors .",
    "however , closer consideration of the problem for finite systems such as nuclei reveals that there exist nontrivial effects resulting from pairing that persist through the entire shell - model spectrum .",
    "in nuclei the mesoscopic nature of the system smoothens all transitional phenomena resulting in more gradual change of properties .",
    "another ( usually ignored ) aspect of the pairing problem is that , along with the very coherent nature of the ground state , pairing brings in a certain degree of incoherent mixing . our goal below is to study the pairing problem in full in order to present a consistent picture of the physical effects associated with the pairing interaction . for a broad range of energies we study the thermodynamical properties , entropy , thermalization and mixing of simple configurations as well as coherent pair excitations , and average moments of inertia .",
    "a thorough consideration of pairing should precede the detailed study of the interplay of the pairing with other components of the residual interaction ( the shell model analysis reveals @xcite unexpected results of this interplay ) .",
    "we study pairing in the framework of the realistic spherical nuclear shell model , which provides a perfect testing ground for discussing the phenomena of interest .",
    "there exist a number of approximate methods for curing the well known shortcomings of the bcs approach for finite systems .",
    "however they can not be used for our purpose . pairing fluctuations extending far below the bcs phase transition",

    "however , in the region of high level density , a statistical description operating with thermodynamical concepts is very appealing . it was shown both for complex atoms and nuclei @xcite that the increase of chaotic mixing with excitation energy and level density is in a sense equivalent to the process of thermalization and",
    "can be treated with the help of a temperature .",
    "moreover , the presence of such mixing is necessary in order to make the neighboring eigenstates ",
    "look the same \" @xcite and justify the statistical averaging as in a microcanonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "in particular , it turned out that the average occupation numbers of single - particle orbitals can be described by the fermi - dirac distribution even in the presence of strong interactions , although the single - particle energies can be renormalized to become those of quasiparticles .",
    "thus , in the statistical region of spectrum we come effectively to the picture of a heated fermi - liquid .    however , it is not clear that a specific interaction such as pairing can lead to full thermalization . as shown in fig .",
    "[ s0_statessn116 ] , the occupancies of single - particle levels derived for the eigenstates of the pairing problem vary on average monotonously with energy , therefore showing a trend to thermalization . at the same time",
    ", there are wild fluctuations which would be even further enhanced if states of different seniorities were included .    to address the thermalization we can define various temperature scales @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical `` absolute temperature '' comes from the density of states @xmath154 therefore @xmath155 the  single - particle \" temperature @xmath156 is linked to the termalization of the system in terms of the distribution of particles over single - particle levels .",
    "it can be determined for each individual eigenstate from the best fit of the occupation numbers to the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath157 [ d5 ] where the chemical potential @xmath58 also can be determined from the two - parameter fit .",
    "= 7.0 cm    in fig .",
    "[ sn116_temprature ] the comparison of these two definitions of temperature for all states in @xmath21sn is shown .",
    "the result is very different from what was observed in the shell model taking into account all residual interactions where @xmath158 and @xmath156 were in a good agreement for the majority of eigenstates ( a similar thermalization occurs as well when random residual interactions are taken ) . with the pairing interaction only ,",
    "the dots representing @xmath156 of individual eigenstates show a low temperature along the entire spectrum whereas the smooth hyperbola corresponds to absolute temperature which has a singularity in the middle of the spectrum .",
    "it is clear that the single - particle thermometer can not measure correctly the temperature of the paired system .",
    "a pure pairing fermionic condensate has properties similar to those observed in macroscopic superfluid systems .",
    "heating , i.e. the increase of excitation energy , results in a gradual destruction of the condensate and an increase in the normal component of the fluid ( increase of seniority in nuclear physics terminology ) .",
    "similarly , a higher angular momentum can be created only by a pair breaking .",
    "the unpaired particles can be coupled to a nonzero angular momentum which can be treated as some kind of rotation . when the spins allowed for a given seniority are fully aligned , any further increase of angular momentum requires a change of configuration and seniority jump , with the corresponding energy increase .",
    "this picture is qualitatively similar to the phenomenon of quantized vortex formation in superfluid liquid @xmath159he .    in fig .",
    "[ sn116_momentum1 ] the energies of all eigenstates in @xmath21sn within the shell model space ( all possible seniorities ) are marked by points in the energy versus angular momentum plane .",
    "the stair - case yrast line , shown by a solid line in fig [ sn116_momentum1 ] , is drawn through the states of maximum spin for each seniority .",
    "it can be fitted well by a parabola ( dashed line ) , thus giving the average moment of inertia @xmath160 mev@xmath161 this result can be compared with the classical moment of inertia of a rigid sphere with uniform density , @xmath162 with mass @xmath163 mev and radius @xmath164 fm ; for @xmath21sn @xmath165 mev@xmath161 it is known that in the adiabatic ( linear response ) approximation a cranked fermi gas has a rigid body moment of inertia while pairing interactions usually reduce this value @xcite by about a factor of 2 .",
    "the above results show that the overall effect of pairing on the rotational properties is considerably quenched at high excitation energy .",
    "the broken pairs and pair vibrations return the moment of inertia to the original fermi - gas value .",
    "this phenomenon has a direct analog in superfluid liquid @xmath159he , where a large number of vortices emerges at high rotation speed forming a lattice structure @xcite which rotates as a whole restoring the rigid body moment of inertia and characteristic average velocity field .",
    "pairing vibrations are primarily responsible for mixing of states in paired systems and therefore they are expected to have a profound effect on the properties of nuclear systems such as the high - spin moment of inertia . for calculating the yrast line shown on fig .",
    "[ sn116_momentum1 ] as a dashed - dotted line , we assume full degeneracy , making all @xmath166 equal . this reduces energy required for the pair transfer and therefore makes pair vibrations stronger and more chaotic . as a result , the moment of inertia was even further increased to a value of 43 mev@xmath161 as could be expected in the degenerate model , where the perturbative cranking approach is not valid , the average angular momentum dependence on energy is vibrational ( close to linear ) , and the quadratic contribution related to the inverse moment of inertia is small .",
    "in this paper we discussed the properties of the pairing interaction in a finite quantum system described within the shell - model approach .",
    "this interaction , being a very important part of the general residual interaction has specific features being effective for pairs with total spin zero only .",
    "the standard approach takes into account the pairing effects with the aid of the bcs approximation borrowed from theory of macroscopic superconductivity .",
    "this approximation fails not only from the viewpoint of particle number nonconservation which might be essential for finite systems , but it also does not work for weak pairing and beyond the phase transition point .",
    "therefore we base our study on the earlier suggested exact numerical solution where the use of the quasispin symmetry provides necessary quantum numbers and simplifies the problem immensely .",
    "the collective excitations in the paired system ( pair vibrations ) are traditionally described by developing the random phase approximation on the background of the bcs ground state .",
    "we show that the exact solution differs from that in the bcs+rpa theory , especially in the region of the phase transition .",
    "it is seen clearly in the example of the realistic shell model for the @xmath21sn nucleus as well as in the analytically solvable two - level model .",
    "analogous results can be obtained for isospin - invariant pairing which will be considered elsewhere .",
    "for the first time we have discussed the chaotic ( incoherent ) aspects of the pairing interaction . the residual interactions in general mix independent particle configurations creating complicated stationary many - body states",
    ". these effects influence both local and global statistical properties of the system . in the case of a generic residual interaction , we come locally to the goe - like nearest level spacing distribution and enhanced spectral rigidity whereas the global behavior reveals thermalization of the system .",
    "typically , the interaction plays the role of a heat bath bringing the single - particle occupancies close to the fermi - dirac distribution even in a strongly interacting system .",
    "the pairing interaction is in many respects exceptional .",
    "although it induces the local level repulsion and increases information entropy of the eigenstates , the spectral rigidity shows a pseudo - oscillatory behavior related to the vibrational character of excitations . both information",
    "( shannon ) and invariant ( von neumann ) entropies distinctly reflect the existence of the phase transition . the normal behavior of thermodynamic entropy associated with the level density coexists with the absence of full thermalization of single - particle motion .",
    "the yrast line of the system reveals the trend to the rigid - body rotation at high excitation energy where many pairs are effectively broken .",
    "pure pairing can not exist as the only two - body interaction ( for a charged system it would violate the gauge invariance , see also @xcite ) . as shown by the full analysis of the statistical properties of the nuclear shell model wave functions",
    "@xcite , the pairing can be considerably modified by the presence of other parts of the residual interaction .",
    "for example , the families of states corresponding to various values of the seniority quantum number are almost completely mixed although the pairing phase transition is still observed through the behavior of the pairing correlators for individual low - lying eigenstates @xcite . however",
    ", beyond the phase transition there exists a long exponentially decreasing tail of dynamic pairing correlations .",
    "the interplay of pairing with other types of residual interaction is an interesting and promising problem for future research .",
