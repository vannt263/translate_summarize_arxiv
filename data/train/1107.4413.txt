    "there has been in the past decade a rapidly growing interest in agent - based models in an attempt to understand the long - term behavior of complex social systems .",
    "these models are characterized by heuristic rules that govern the outcome of an interaction between two agents , and a graphical structure , modeling either physical space or a social network , that encodes the pairs of agents that may interact due to , e.g. , geographical proximity or friendship .",
    "the main objective of research in this field is to deduce the macroscopic behavior that emerges from the microscopic rules , which also depends on the structure of the network of interactions .",
    "the mathematical term for agent - based models is interacting particle systems though , as scientific fields , the former involves numerical simulations whereas the latter is based on rigorous mathematical analyses .",
    "while there is a common effort from sociologists , economists , psychologists , and statistical physicists to understand such models , interacting particle systems of interest in social sciences have been so far essentially ignored by mathematicians , with the notable exception of the voter model .",
    "this paper is motivated by this lack of analytical results and continues the study initiated in @xcite for one of the most popular models of social dynamics : the axelrod model @xcite . the effort to collect analytical results",
    "is mainly justified by the fact that stochastic spatial simulations are generally difficult to interpret .",
    "this is especially true for the axelrod model which , in contrast with the voter model , has a number of absorbing states that grows exponentially with the size of the network , and for which simulations of the finite system can freeze in atypical configurations , thus exhibiting behaviors which are not symptomatic of the long - term behavior of their infinite counterpart .",
    "the axelrod model @xcite has been proposed by political scientist robert axelrod as a stochastic model for the dissemination of culture .",
    "the heuristic microscopic rules include two important social factors : homophily , which is the tendency of individuals to interact more frequently with individuals who are more similar , and social influence , which is the tendency of individuals to become more similar when they interact .",
    "note that the voter model @xcite accounts for the latter but not for the former : individuals are characterized by one of two competing opinions which they update at a constant rate by mimicking one of their neighbors chosen uniformly at random . in particular , any two individuals in the voter model either totally agree or totally disagree , which prevents homophily from being incorporated in the model . in contrast , individuals in the axelrod model are characterized by a vector , also called a culture , that consists of @xmath0 coordinates , called cultural features , each of which assumes one of @xmath1 possible states .",
    "homophily can thus be naturally modeled in terms of a certain cultural distance between two individuals : pairs of neighbors interact at a rate equal to the fraction of features they have in common .",
    "social influence is then modeled as follows : each time two individuals interact , one of the cultural features for which the interacting pair disagrees ( if any ) is chosen uniformly at random , and the state of one of both individuals is set equal to the state of the other individual for this cultural feature . more formally , the axelrod model on the infinite one - dimensional lattice , which is the network of interactions considered in this paper , is the continuous - time markov chain whose state space consists of all spatial configurations @xmath2 to describe the dynamics of the axelrod model , we let @xmath3 where @xmath4 refers to the @xmath5th coordinate of the vector @xmath6 , denote the fraction of cultural features vertex @xmath7 and vertex @xmath8 have in common .",
    "in addition , we introduce the operator @xmath9 on the set of spatial configurations defined by @xmath10 in other words , configuration @xmath11 is obtained from configuration @xmath12 by setting the @xmath5th feature of the individual at vertex @xmath7 equal to the @xmath5th feature of the individual at vertex @xmath8 and leaving the state of all the other features in the system unchanged .",
    "the dynamics of the axelrod model are then described by the markov generator @xmath13 defined on the set of cylinder functions by @xmath14 \\ { \\mathbf{1}}\\{\\eta ( x , i ) \\neq \\eta ( y , i ) \\ } \\ [ f ( \\sigma_{x , y , i } \\,\\eta ) - f ( \\eta)].\\ ] ] note that the expression of the markov generator indicates that the conditional rate at which the @xmath5th feature of vertex @xmath7 is set equal to the @xmath5th feature of vertex @xmath8 given that these two vertices are nearest neighbors that disagree on their @xmath5th feature can be written as @xmath15 \\ = \\ f ( x , y ) \\ \\times \\ \\frac{1}{f \\,(1 - f ( x , y ) ) } \\ \\times \\ \\frac{1}{2}\\ ] ] which , as required , equals the fraction of features both vertices have in common , which is the rate at which the vertices interact , times the reciprocal of the number of features for which both vertices disagree , which is the probability that any of these features is the one chosen to be updated , times the probability one half that vertex @xmath7 rather than vertex @xmath8 is chosen to be updated .",
    "the main question about the axelrod model is whether or not the population converges to a consensus when starting from a random configuration . for simplicity , we assume that the initial cultures at different sites are independent and identically distributed , and that at a given site , each of the @xmath16 possible initial cultures appears with the same probability .",
    "the term `` consensus '' is defined mathematically in terms of clustering of the infinite system : the model is said to cluster if @xmath17 and is said to coexist otherwise .",
    "the dichotomy between clustering and coexistence for the finite model is unclear since , as mentioned above , the finite system can hit an absorbing state in which different cultures are present even though its infinite counterpart clusters . in order to characterize the transition between the two regimes , vilone _ et al _",
    "@xcite considered the random variable @xmath18 which refers to the length of the largest interval in which all individuals share the same culture in the absorbing state hit by the finite system , and distinguished between the two regimes depending on whether the expected value of this random variable scales like the population size or is uniformly bounded . denoting the population size by @xmath19",
    ", their spatial simulations suggest that @xmath20 so we conjecture clustering when @xmath21 and coexistence when @xmath22 for the one - dimensional infinite system .",
    "the mathematical analysis of the axelrod model initiated in @xcite strongly suggests the coexistence part of the conjecture for a certain subset of the parameter region .",
    "more precisely , letting @xmath23 denote the number of cultural domains in the absorbing state hit by the finite system , it is proved based on duality - like techniques and a coupling with a simple urn problem that @xmath24 it is also proved that the infinite system clusters in the critical case @xmath25 . in this paper",
    ", we extend this result to all values of the number of features when the number of states per feature is again equal to two , which proves the clustering part of the conjecture stated above when @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , we have the following theorem .     [ thm ] the @xmath0-feature 2-state axelrod model on @xmath27 clusters , starting from the random initial configuration in which the cultures at different sites are independent and identically distributed and at a given site , each of the @xmath28 possible initial cultures appears with the same probability .    the proof when @xmath25 is carried out in @xcite based on duality techniques for the voter model through the existence of a natural coupling between the two - feature two - state axelrod model and the voter model obtained by identifying cultures with no feature in common .",
    "this coupling , however , fails for any other values of the parameters , so a different approach is needed to extend the result to a larger number of features .",
    "the first step is to construct a coupling between the two - state axelrod model and a certain collection of non - independent systems of annihilating symmetric random walks that keep track of the disagreements between nearest neighbors .",
    "clustering of the axelrod model is equivalent to extinction of these systems of annihilating random walks .",
    "the proof of the latter is inspired by a symmetry argument introduced by adelman @xcite which is combined with certain parity properties of the collection of non - independent systems of random walks .",
    "in this section , we represent the axelrod model on @xmath27 by a particle system that keeps track of the interfaces between cultural domains , thus looking at the disagreements along the edges of the graph rather than the actual cultures on the vertices .",
    "this approach is motivated by the fact that consensus in the axelrod model is equivalent to the extinction of its interfaces . in order to obtain a well - defined markov process",
    ", it is necessary to keep track of the features for which neighbors disagree rather than simply the number of these features .",
    "therefore , we think of each edge of the graph as having @xmath0 levels , and place a particle on edge @xmath29 at level @xmath5 if and only if vertex @xmath7 and vertex @xmath8 disagree on their @xmath5th feature .",
    "that is , we define @xmath30 and place a particle at site @xmath31 at level @xmath5 whenever @xmath32 . to study the dynamics of this system and the rates at which particles jump",
    ", it will be useful to also keep track of the number of particles per site so we introduce @xmath33 and call @xmath34 a @xmath35-site whenever it has a total of @xmath35 particles : @xmath36 . to understand the evolution",
    ", we first observe that when a particle jumps , it moves right or left with equal probability , unless another particle already occupies the site on which the particle tries to jump in which case the particles annihilate each other .",
    "thus , these processes induce a collection of @xmath0 non - independent systems of annihilating symmetric random walks .",
    "the symmetry is due to the fact that , when two neighbors interact , each of them is equally likely to be the one chosen to be updated . also , the reason why a collision between two particles results in an annihilation is that when two individuals disagree with a third one on a given feature , these two individuals must agree on this feature , which happens when @xmath26 .",
    "( note however that for larger values of @xmath1 collisions between particles would result in either an annihilating event or a coalescing event depending on the configuration of the underlying axelrod model . )",
    "even though the evolution of the particle system at a single level is somewhat reminiscent of the evolution of the interfaces of the one - dimensional voter model , it is in fact much more complicated due to the presence of strong dependencies among the different levels .",
    "these dependencies result from the inclusion of homophily in the model , which implies that particles jump at varying rates .",
    "more precisely , since two adjacent vertices that disagree on exactly @xmath35 of their features interact at rate @xmath37 , the fraction of features they share , and the site between these vertices is a @xmath35-site , given that @xmath34 is a @xmath35-site each particle at site @xmath34 jumps at rate @xmath38 this indicates that the motion of the particles is slowed down at sites that contain more particles , with the dynamics being frozen at sites with @xmath0 particles .",
    "in the following sections , we will call particles frozen or active depending on whether these particles are located at an @xmath0-site or not , respectively .",
    "we refer the reader to figure [ fig : axm ] for simulation pictures of the systems of annihilating random walks when @xmath39 .",
    "in this section , we prove that no site can remain an @xmath0-site forever , which is the key to proving consensus in the two - state axelrod model . from the point of view of the particle system described in the previous section , this means that if some site @xmath34 is completely filled with particles at some time , then eventually another particle will jump onto the site @xmath34 , annihilating one of the frozen particles on the site and making the other @xmath40 particles active .     [ prop : symmetry ] assume that site @xmath31 is a @xmath0-site at time @xmath41 .",
    "then , @xmath42    it will be useful in the proof of the proposition to construct graphically the particle system described in the previous section using the following collections of independent poisson processes and random variables : for each pair of site and feature @xmath43 ,    * we let @xmath44 be a rate one poisson process , * we denote by @xmath45 its @xmath46th arrival time : @xmath47 , * we let @xmath48 be a collection of independent bernoulli variables with @xmath49 * and we let @xmath50 be a collection of independent uniform ( 0 , 1 ) random variables .    the system of annihilating random walks is constructed as follows . at time @xmath51 , we draw an arrow labeled @xmath5 from site @xmath52 to site @xmath53 to indicate that if @xmath54 then the particle at site @xmath52 at level @xmath5 jumps to site @xmath53 .    the above construction can be extended naturally to any subgraph @xmath55 of the lattice by using the same collections of independent poisson processes and random variables and killing all the particles that jump onto a site @xmath52 which is not the center of an edge of the graph .",
    "consider now the case in which the graph @xmath55 is the one induced by the vertex set @xmath56 .",
    "suppose the initial configuration is such that the left - most edge has @xmath0 particles , one at every level , while every level of every other edge independently has a particle at time zero with probability @xmath57 .",

    "returning now to the setting of proposition [ prop : symmetry ] , fix a site @xmath31 and a time @xmath61 , and suppose that particles at that space time point are frozen : @xmath62 .",
    "we will consider only the sites to the right of @xmath34 and show that eventually some particle from the right must jump onto @xmath34 , unless the site @xmath34 has already been hit from the left .",
    "lemma [ lem : symmetry ] below will allow us to break the process into stages , and give a lower bound for the probability that a particle at @xmath34 is annihilated at each stage .",

    "[ def : active ] the interval @xmath63 is said to be active at time @xmath41 if the numbers of particles it contains at two different levels differ in their parity , i.e. , @xmath64     [ lem : break ] assume that @xmath65 is active at time @xmath41 and @xmath66 .",

    "we must analyze in detail the process at each stage . for @xmath74 , @xmath75 ,",
    "let @xmath76 be the @xmath77-field generated by the graphical representation of the systems of random walks over the spatial interval @xmath78 through time @xmath41 .",
    "we will prove ( [ aiprob ] ) by induction on @xmath79 .",
    "as part of the induction hypothesis , we will assume that at the beginning of the @xmath79th stage of the construction , we have a site @xmath80 such that the following two conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath81 for @xmath82 , 2 .",

    "note that the assumption @xmath93 is not necessary at this stage of the proof but it will be useful later in the proof to obtain a lower bound of the probability that a certain interval is active .",

    "the law of this process is therefore the same as the law of its mirror image . *",
    "because particles at site @xmath90 and site @xmath113 have no opportunity to interact with other particles before time @xmath91 , on these sites at each level there is a particle independently with probability @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , the probability that the number of particles at two given levels of these two sites have the same parity is equal to @xmath57 .    by the last observation above ,",
    "if a reflection occurs , then the interval from @xmath34 to @xmath108 is active in the sense of definition [ def : active ] with probability at least @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , by the symmetry noted in the second observation above , the first change either to site @xmath34 or site @xmath108 happens to site @xmath34 with probability @xmath57 . hence ,",

    "we now return to the case in which only the sites to the left of @xmath34 are discarded , which means there is a possibility that some particle could jump onto @xmath108 from the right . in this case ,",
    "conditional on the event of a reflection , which implies that the particles at @xmath108 are frozen until at least @xmath88 , and thinking of site @xmath108 as the left - most edge in the definition of @xmath59 , we see that there is a probability larger than @xmath59 that no particle will jump from @xmath121 to @xmath108 before time @xmath88 .",
    "we deduce that there is probability at least @xmath122 that site @xmath34 will change by time @xmath88 , which gives . finally , we let @xmath123 because no particle to the right of @xmath89 can reach @xmath80 by time @xmath88 , we have @xmath124 , which completes the proof of the lemma .",
