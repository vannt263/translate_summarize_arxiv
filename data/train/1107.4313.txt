    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) plays a central role in galaxy evolution as the birthsite of new stars and repository of old stellar ejecta .",
    "the formation of new stars slowly consumes the ism , locking it up for millions to billions of years . as these stars age , the winds from low mass , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , high mass , red supergiants ( rsgs)/wolf rayet stars / luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , and supernova explosions inject nucleosynthetic products of stellar interiors into the ism , slowly increasing its metallicity .",
    "this constant recycling and associated enrichment drives the evolution of a galaxy s visible matter and changes its emission characteristics . to understand this recycling",

    "* ) and history of disruption by tidal interaction @xcite .",
    "the smc offers a rare glimpse into the physical processes in an environment with a metallicity which is below the threshold of 1/41/3 z@xmath2 where the properties of the ism in galaxies changes significantly as traced by the rapid reduction in the aromatic emission / polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) dust mass fractions and dust - to - gas ratios @xcite .",
    "in addition , the smc is the only local galaxy which has the ultraviolet dust characteristics ( lack of 2175    extinction bump , * ? ? ? * ) of starburst galaxies in the local @xcite and high - redshift ( @xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) universe .",
    "the evolution of stars in the smc is also clearly affected by their low metallicities @xcite with the corresponding expected differences in stellar mass loss @xcite .",
    "the large and small magellanic clouds represent the nearest example of tidally interacting galaxies and the magellanic bridge is a clear manifestation of a close encounter of these two galaxies some 200 myr ago @xcite . over cosmological timescales ,",
    "galaxy interactions are one of the key drivers of galaxy evolution and , thus , tidally interacting galaxies allow us to examine star formation in an unusual and disturbed environment , which resembles the conditions in the early universe when galaxies were forming .",
    "the magellanic bridge is a filament of neutral hydrogen , which joins the smc and lmc over some 15 kpc @xcite .",
    "recent studies have revealed the presence of young ( @xmath4200 myrs ) massive stars @xcite associated with the highest - density portion of the bridge directly adjacent to the smc main body . given the relative youth of these stars , they are highly likely to have been formed in situ making this structure a tidal tail from the smc .",
    "the sage - smc ( surveying the agents of galaxy evolution in the tidally - stripped , low metallicity small magellanic cloud ) program is a _ spitzer _ cycle 4 legacy ( 285 hours , pi : k.  gordon , pid : 40245 ) to map the full smc ( 30  @xmath1 ) including the body , wing , and tail using the infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",

    "the sage - smc program builds on the pathfinder s@xmath5mc program @xcite that surveyed the inner @xmath03  @xmath1 of this galaxy .",
    "the sage - smc observations allow us to trace the life cycle of dust ( and thereby gas ) on a galaxy wide scale from their injection by late - type stars , through their sojourn in the violent ism , until their involvement in the formation of stars .",
    "in addition , the infrared ( ir ) emission traces the global structure of the ism on a galaxy - wide scale and the interrelationship of the various phases of the ism .",
    "this survey provides a complete census of the massive star formation population in this low and spatially varying metallicity environment . with much improved wavelength coverage , up to @xmath01000 times better point source sensitivity and @xmath013 times better angular resolution than the midcourse space experiment ( _ msx _ ) and infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras _ ) surveys ,",

    "* ) and milky way ( glimpse , mipsgal , * ? ? ?",

    "the sage - smc survey provides a crucial link in our understanding of galaxies during low metallicity , chemically - primitive stages .",
    "this paper presents the overview of the sage - smc legacy program including the science motivation , observation details , data reduction , point source catalog creation , and publicly available data products .",
    "in addition , results from all three areas ( interstellar medium , star formation , and stellar mass loss ) of scientific interest of the sage - smc team are presented .",
    "a uniform , unbiased survey of the whole smc ( @xmath0@xmath6 ) including the bar , wing , and tail ( fig .  [ fig_smc_mwave ] ) , in all the irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8  ) and mips ( 24 , 70 and 160  ) bands is the basis of the sage - smc legacy program .",
    "the angular resolutions of the different bands are 2(0.6  pc , irac ) , 6  ( 1.7  pc , mips 24  ) , 18  ( 5.2  pc , mips 70  ) , and 40  ( 12  pc , mips 160  ) .",

    "sage - smc provides an improvement in resolution that ranges from a factor of 9 at 8  to 13 at 70  to 3 at 160  .",
    "the sage - smc @xmath9 point source sensitivities , based on completeness of the point source catalogs , are 0.045 , 0.028 , 0.12 and 0.10  mjy in the irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8  bands , respectively (  [ irac_completeness ] ) , and 0.7 , 25 and 200  mjy in the mips 24 , 70 and 160  bands , respectively (  [ sec_mips_points ] ) .",

    "the sage - smc observations were taken with @xmath11 degree tiles of irac high dynamic range ( hdr ) exposures , and mips fast scans with varying scan leg lengths . to minimize artifacts that limit sensitivity",
    ", we mapped at two epochs , separated by @xmath03 ( irac ) and @xmath09 ( mips ) months , which provides a @xmath090@xmath12 roll angle difference .",
    "this mapping strategy maximizes observing efficiency while minimizing artifacts that compromise data quality .",
    "the irac and mips artifacts fall in two classes : random effects ( e.g.  cosmic rays , bad pixels ) and systematic effects that are tied to pixel location and usually systematically affect rows / columns .",
    "irac systematic effects include : saturation latents , scattered light , mux bleed , banding , and column pulldown @xcite .",
    "mips systematic effects include : jailbars , pick - off mirror spots , latent images , and scattered light at 24  @xcite , streaking due to saturation latents and time - dependent responsivity drifts at 70 & 160  @xcite , and insufficient 160  coverage in fast scan mode .",
    "clean removal of random effects requires at least 4 overlapping measurements .",
    "systematic effects are optimally removed by combining images taken with a @xmath090@xmath12 roll angle difference .",
    "this type of strategy is recommended by the _",
    "science center ( ssc ) and the irac and mips instrument teams and has been proven to be very successful in the sage - lmc data analysis @xcite .    to achieve the above goals ,",
    "four 12s irac hdr exposures were taken in pairs at two different epochs .",
    "each hdr exposure consists of both a 12s and 0.6s exposures and after accounting for deadtime the total effective exposure time per pixel is 41.6 s. a tile size of @xmath13 was executed in mapping mode using 120 pixel steps between rows and 240 pixel steps between columns .",
    "steps were done instead of dithers to minimize the time required to cover the whole area , and to ensure no gaps occurred in the region being mapped .",
    "each irac astronomical observing request ( aor ) consists of a 14@xmath1428 map of 12s hdr frames .",
    "two aors overlap at each position , resulting in coverage of at least four 12s hdr frames .",
    "each mips aor consists of 8 - 16 fast scan legs that are 2@xmath125@xmath12 long with 1/2 array cross scan steps .",
    "the smc was observed with an optimized grid of these aors .",
    "tight sequential constraints relative to the roll angle rate of change were used so that neighboring long strips had sufficient overlap .",
    "we carefully designed our mips strategy to ensure off - source measurements in every scan leg which allows for accurate self - calibration of the instrumental effects .",
    "while mips fast scan mode does not achieve full coverage at 160  , the sage - lmc observations have shown that the use of the two sets of observations with one set rotated @xmath090  from the other produces a mostly filled 160  map @xcite .",

    "information more detailed than is given in this paper about the processing and data products can be found in the sage - smc data description delivery 3 document ( hereafter ddd3 ) .",
    "both sage - smc epochs of data and the s@xmath20mc data were combined to produce the mosaic images .",
    "the images are mosaicked using the montage package ( v3.0 ) , and are projected to equatorial coordinates .",
    "the mosaic images conserve the surface brightness from the original images ; the units are mjy / sr .",
    "we matched instrumental background variations between the images using montage s level background correction algorithm .",
    "the background - matching process introduced an artificial gradient in the mosaic images which was removed by comparing the large - scale background variations to the original images .",
    "residual images ( images with point sources removed ) were produced by running daophot @xcite on the 12 second frame - time bcd frames .",
    "note that we repeat the photometry calculations on the residual , bcd images ( referred to as `` tweaking '' ) , which has been shown to substantially improve the flux estimates in complex background regions .",
    "the residual mosaics are created from individual frame residual images .",
    "thus , if a source is extracted in some but not all frames it will show up in these images as a source ( although its brightness will be reduced because it is being averaged with images where the source was extracted ) .",
    "sources may not be extracted for a variety of reasons , mainly due to cosmic ray contamination , saturation / non - linearity limits and along the frame edges .",

    "in addition , there is a discontinuity in the uncertainties at the magnitude where the photometry transitions between single - frame to mosaic .",
    "we choose to use the mosaic photometry results over the single - frame photometry ( when applicable ) to avoid the known problem of malmquist bias in our single - frame photometry as our single - frame photometry approaches it s faint limit whereby the single - frame photometry is known to become progressively too bright .",
    "we believe these mosaic photometry values are more reliable ( although with somewhat larger uncertainties ) than the single - frame photometry results    to ensure that our photometric calibration is uniform across the large area observed by sage - smc , and between different aors , epochs , and wavelengths , we compared our photometry to a network of absolute stellar calibrators custom - built for sage - smc .",
    "these are 53 a0-a5v or k0-m2iii stars selected from simbad ; their surface density within the sage smc area is approximately 3 stars/@xmath1 , uniformly distributed across the smc .",

    "the method employed to produce the sage - smc network of calibrators is identical to that used to create the suite of standards at the north ecliptic pole @xcite from which the irac primary calibrators were selected @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the sage - smc magnitudes and those predicted from the calibration stars is excellent ( plots can be found in the ddd3 document ,  3.5.2 ) , with differences between the two much smaller than the one - sigma errors of our photometry .",
    "the ensemble averaged differences and standard deviations in the four irac bands between sage - smc and the predicted magnitudes are 0.010@xmath230.062 , 0.024@xmath230.060 , 0.002@xmath230.060 , 0.018@xmath230.052 , for bands [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0 ] respectively , for epoch 1 and are similar to those for epoch 2 .",
    "these values are consistent with other surveys processed with the wisconsin irac pipeline ( e.g. glimpse and sage - lmc ) .",
    "there is no statistical offset between the predicted magnitude of the calibrators and the extracted values .",
    "the s@xmath5mc observations ( epoch 0 ) were re - processed as part of the sage - smc project .",
    "the sage - smc epoch 0 irac photometry of point sources showed systematic offsets when compared to the s@xmath20mc catalog @xcite in the [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] bands ( @xmath00.2  mag ; see  3.5.4 of the ddd3 ) .",
    "the s@xmath5mc region contains 6 of the 53 primary flux calibrators described in the previous section and the sage - smc epoch 0 archive magnitudes of the 6 calibrators shows agreement to within the formal photometric errors .",
    "this comparison suggests that the wisconsin irac pipeline processing produces no systematic offsets from magnitudes predicted by the flux calibrators ( at least down to 11th magnitude , the faintest calibrators ) .",
    "the origin of the differences is not specifically known , but it is suspected to be somewhere in the mosaicking and photometry stage of the s@xmath5mc processing .",
    "the consistency of the sage - smc irac photometry was checked by comparing photometry of sources found in the sage - smc epoch  0 and epoch  1 catalogs .",
    "there is no offset and the degree of scatter , especially at the brighter magnitudes , is likely due to true variables in these two data sets ( see  3.5.4 of the ddd3 ) .",

    "these sourcelists are more complete due to cosmic ray removal from the mosaic images before source extraction , and the lower noise from the mosaic images .",

    "the custom post - processing steps ( for each aor ) included masking of bright source latents , a 2nd scan mirror independent flat field , background subtraction ( mainly removing the variable zodiacal light ) , correction of piecewise jailbars produced by bright saturating sources , matching the levels between adjacent images ( when offsets were found to be above the noise ) , and correcting for scan mirror position dependent scattered light .",
    "the custom post - processing steps at 70  are the removal of the instrumental baseline variations and correction for the flux dependent non - linearities .",
    "the instrumental baseline variations are removed by subtracting a low order polynomial fit as a function of observation time to the data taken outside of the smc .",
    "this step is only possible as the observations were designed such that each scan leg included measurements beyond the smc .",
