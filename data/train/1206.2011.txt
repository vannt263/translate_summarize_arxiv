    "the srsic index of g1 is close to the canonical value for elliptical galaxies , @xmath51 , whereas for g2 it is close to the typical value for disk galaxies , @xmath52 .",
    "we therefore assume that g1 is an elliptical galaxy , whereas g2 is disk - like .",
    "this is also consistent with the bluer color of g2 .",

    "we also remark that the @xmath53 colors of g3 and g5 are different from those of a and b , and it is therefore unlikely that these are additional , faint gravitationally lensed quasar images .    in the uh88 and subaru telescope imaging observations ,",
    "the flux ratio a / b is above unity , in opposition to the sdss results . the chromatic change in the brightness ranking of the quasar images",
    "could be explained by microlensing ( see  [ sec : microlensing ] ) .",
    "in order to determine whether the two brighter galaxies are located in the foreground of the quasar pair , as is required by the gravitational lens hypothesis , we need to estimate their redshifts .",
    "we estimate photometric redshifts , based on the magnitudes of the galaxies in different filters , using the template - fitting methods implemented in the publicly available hyperz @xcite and eazy @xcite algorithms .",

    "we employ the observed mean seds of local galaxies from ( * ? ? ?",

    "the eazy algorithm also uses the redshift distribution of galaxies of a given apparent magnitude as a bayesian luminosity prior , following @xcite .",
    "this helps to break the degeneracies between multiple probability distribution peaks at different redshifts .    in order to obtain consistent results for the two algorithms",
    ", we had to increase the uncertainties on the magnitudes to about double the values quoted in table [ tab : photometry ] , which also makes most of the aperture- and model - determined values consistent .",
    "in addition to the statistical errors quoted in that table , additional sources of errors could potentially be introduced by the zero - point uncertainties ( table [ tab : followup - data ] ) , possible blending of sources due to their close proximity and large seeing , different pixel size in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath23 band observations ( aperture photometry ) , or the modeling difficulties and psf uncertainties ( model magnitudes ) .",
    "the results of the photometric redshift estimates are shown in figure [ fig : photoz ] and table [ tab : photoz ] .",
    "g1 is well - fitted by an elliptical template , and g2 by an sbc template , consistent with the expectations from the galaxy morphologies ( see  [ sec : image ] ) .",
    "although the probability distributions are rather broad , they are in agreement , inside the @xmath55 interval estimated from the redshift probability distributions , with @xmath2 , which is the redshift of the absorption lines identified in both spectra .",
    "the redshift of the second absorption system in quasar b , at @xmath56 , is rejected at about @xmath57 confidence level , while the probability of a redshift as high as the quasar redshift appears negligible .",
    "therefore , throughout the rest of this work , we assume that these galaxies are responsible for the absorption lines at @xmath2 .    for the faintest objects we detected , g3 , g4 and g5 , the redshift probability distributions are very broad ( table [ tab : photoz ] ) .",
    "g3 and g5 show a smaller preferred redshift of @xmath58 . on the other hand",
    ", g4 has a preferred redshift of 1.11 , very close to that of the absorption system at @xmath35 .",
    "this absorption system is quite strong , with equivalent width @xmath59     in the rest frame of the absorber . here",
    "the projected proper distance between b and g4 is 21@xmath60 kpc at @xmath35 . on the other hand , the absorption system at @xmath2 has equivalent widths @xmath59    and @xmath61    ( in the spectra of quasars a and b , respectively ) for impact parameter @xmath62 kpc , corresponding to the distances between the quasars and g1 , g2 .",
    "such strong absorptions at small impact parameters are consistent with the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the stronger absorption in quasar b could be explained by its closer proximity to one of the galaxies ( g1 ) .",
    "we next proceed with modeling the system as a gravitational lens .",
    "the observational constraints provided by the available astrometry and photometry are the positions of the images a and b , their fluxes ( we take the flux ratio to be either @xmath63 or @xmath64 , as we will show in  [ sec : discuss - spec ] ) , and the positions of the two main galaxies expected to act as lenses , g1 and g2 .",
    "we also know the redshift of the source , @xmath0 , and of the lenses , @xmath2 .",
    "as the number of observational constraints is limited , we focus on simple sis and nfw lens models and their elliptical counterparts , with or without shear .",

    "it has also been employed in the lens modeling of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the nfw profile @xcite , on the other hand , is frequently employed as an approximation of the mass distribution in dark matter haloes , which dominate galaxy clusters .",
    "constraints can also be placed on the `` strength '' of the lenses , represented ( in the case of the sis model ) by their velocity dispersions , which we infer from the observed luminosities . to this end",
    ", we estimate the rest frame @xmath38 band absolute magnitudes of g1 and g2 as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , calculated with hyperz from the best - fit e and sbc templates .",
    "we use the faber - jackson ( f - j ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the tully - fisher ( t - f ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) laws , with parameters given in @xcite , and infer velocity dispersions of @xmath67 km s@xmath6 and @xmath68 km s@xmath6 , respectively . for g2 , which is disk - like , we have assumed a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) profile and estimated the velocity dispersion as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the circular velocity obtained from the t - f law .",
    "the velocity dispersion estimate above implies that the brightest galaxy g1 has an einstein radius of only @xmath712 , and an inclosed mass of @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "however , the large separation between a and b ( @xmath74 ) , assuming they are lensed images of a single source , implies an enclosed mass of @xmath75 @xmath73 .",
    "consequently , this can not be a gravitational lens system where the main deflectors are the individual members of a group of galaxies , and we need to invoke a significant embedding dark matter halo .",
    "a question worth posing is to what extent must the faintest objects g3 , g4 and g5 , be taken into account when building gravitational lens models .",
    "we only estimate the velocity dispersion of g4 , assumed to be at @xmath2 or @xmath35 ( see  [ sec : photoz ] ) .",
    "we neglect the contribution of g3 and g5 , as they are located further away from images a and b , and are most likely at a significantly different redshift from g1 , g2 and g4 . assuming that g4 is located at the same redshift as g1 and g2 leads to velocity dispersions @xmath76 km s@xmath6 or @xmath77 km s@xmath6 , from the f - j and t - f laws , respectively .",
    "a smaller effective velocity dispersion would be inferred if placing g4 at redshift @xmath35 ( see  [ sec : appen - g4 ] for details ) .",
    "we subsequently explore gravitational lens models in which the lensing potentials of g1 , g2 and g4 are boosted by an embedding dark matter halo .",
    "we model the observed galaxies with sis profiles , and the dark matter halo with either an sis or an nfw profile .",
    "we consider the case where the dark matter halo is centered at the location of the brightest galaxy g1 , as well as the case where its position is a free parameter , on which we obtain constraints .",
    "we only consider models with 0 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , which we are able to fit perfectly ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this means that for the models where the center of the dark matter halo is fixed , we save two parameters which we can use to introduce a shear / ellipticity and associated position angle . the gravitational lens modeling is performed with _ glafic _ @xcite .",
    "we show the critical lines and caustics for these models in figure [ fig : lens1 ] .",
    "we report the best fitted parameters of the models ( velocity dispersion or virial mass of the dark matter halo , ellipticity / shear and associated position angle , total magnification and time delay ) in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "the velocity dispersions of g2 and g4 ( also g1 in the case of the `` sis free '' and `` nfw free '' models of figure [ fig : lens1 ] ) were fixed at the values inferred earlier , but we also explored , on a suitable grid , combinations of velocity dispersions in the ranges allowed by the f - j and t - f laws . in this case , we only considered models with @xmath79 , corresponding to the @xmath55 confidence interval for two parameters .",
    "the effect of the range of velocity dispersions is reflected in the range of values for the parameters in table [ tab : models ] , as well as the allowed position of the dark matter halo , for the `` sis free '' and `` nfw free '' models .",
    "there are two major differences between the nfw and sis models considered for the dark matter halo .",
    "first , we parameterize the nfw profile by its virial mass m@xmath80 and concentration parameter @xmath81 ( as opposed to just a single parameter , @xmath82 , for the sis model ) , and we fix @xmath81 at a fiducial value 6 , close to the typical value for galaxy clusters at the mass range and redshift we are interested in ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "we explore different choices of @xmath81 in  [ sec : appen - cvir ] .",
    "second , the nfw profile is shallower than sis at the center , and can therefore produce an additional faint central image .",
    "therefore , for the `` nfw free '' model , we require that the model produce no more than three images , and that the central image be @xmath83 times or more fainter than b , corresponding to our detection limit at s / n @xmath84 in the deepest band , @xmath48 . the central image can not be one of the faint objects g3 or g5 , as those objects are too far away from the midpoint between a and b , are also most likely extended , and have different colors .",
    "finally , in addition to the models where the dark matter halo is fixed on g1 , we tried a similar range of sis@xmath85 models at the location of g2 , but were unable to produce good fits .",
    "we note that g2 is farther away from the line connecting images a and b , and therefore a model centered on g2 is expected to do a poorer job of fitting the data .",
    "we do not try to fix the dark matter halo at the location of g4 , as we are not sure whether this galaxy is at the same redshift as g1 and g2 , and we also do not expect the dark matter halo to be centered on a fainter galaxy of the group / cluster .",
    "our main result in this section is that any reasonable mass model reproduces the observed image configuration . in order for this system to be a two - image gravitationally lensed quasar",
    ", we do however require a massive dark matter halo in which the visible galaxies are embedded .",
    "this halo should be centered either on g1 ( but not on g2 ) or at some location close to the midpoint between a and b. the choice of the intrinsic flux ratio ( either @xmath86 or @xmath87 ) does not affect the successful mass models qualitatively .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : appen - caveat ] we discuss several caveats regarding the estimated velocity dispersions of the galaxies .",
    "the three physical phenomena known to modify the spectra of the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are differential extinction due to dust in the lensing galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , microlensing due to stars in the lens ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and intrinsic quasar variability coupled with the time delays between images .",
    "the first process is a static one , whereas the other two are time - dependent .",
    "we assess their effects on the continuum and broad - band fluxes in turn .      the most striking difference in the follow - up spectra of quasars a and b is the gradual drop in the flux ratio a / b with wavelength , shortward of about 7000  .",
    "such an effect has previously been observed in several lensed quasars , such as sdss  j1001 + 5027 @xcite and sdss  j1313 + 5151 @xcite .",
    "differential extinction ( reddening ) between the quasar images could explain this effect , as it is most effective at short wavelengths . here",
    "we caution however that the monotonous drop in the flux ratio may also be due to unknown differential slit losses in the arc 3.5 m spectroscopy .",
    "nonetheless , we do not expect the differential slit losses to be large , because the flux drop is supported by the available photometry from @xmath19 to @xmath23 band , which shows quasar a to be redder than b ( see also figures [ fig : sdss - imag ] and [ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "in addition , the flux ratios inferred from the uh88 photometry , obtained just two months after the follow - up spectra , are consistent with the spectral ratios at the respective wavelengths . on the other hand",
    ", extinction should be weakest in the longest wavelength filter @xmath48 , which corresponds roughly to @xmath46 band in the rest frame of g1 and g2 .",
    "a caveat however is that there is no obvious galaxy responsible for the extinction in a , i.e. located much closer to a than the other galaxies are to b.    in contrast , the large change in the spectral slope of quasar a at short wavelengths , on a time span of 13 months , between the original sdss and arc observations , requires a significant contribution of the time - dependent phenomena .",
    "while the slope change can also be caused by slit losses , the two sets of photometric data in the @xmath37 - @xmath23 band range , taken @xmath18 4 years apart , also shows the brightness rank of the two quasars interchanging , with a getting brighter , and b becoming fainter .",
    "therefore time - dependent phenomena must be acting on the quasars .",
    "we next look into the extent to which microlensing can explain these data .",
    "we assume that the microlensing variability is due to the motion of stars in the lensing galaxies , which we consider to be dominated by the proper motion of the galaxies , with transverse velocity @xmath88 , where @xmath82 is the velocity dispersion in the galaxy group / cluster .",
    "following @xcite in the following formulae , there are two timescales to the microlensing event .",
    "the first is the expected duration of the event , which is the time in which the microlens crosses the source ,    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the size of the source quasar accretion disk in the rest frame ultraviolet , corresponding to the optical region of the observed spectrum of sdss  j1320 + 1644 .",
    "it has an estimated extent of a few light - days or less ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the second timescale is the mean interval between microlensing events , which is crudely estimated as the time needed to cross an einstein radius , @xmath91    with @xmath92 being the mass of the microlens .",
    "although these results are rough estimates , they are close to the timescales on which our data shows spectral and photometric variations .",
    "careful analytical considerations of the expected microlensing light curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as ray - shooting techniques to account for the fact that the source could be microlensed by an ensemble of stars at any particular time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that microlensing can indeed cause variations in amplitude comparable to , or even larger than we observe in the spectro - photometric data . in standard accretion disk theory ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , short wavelength emission originates at comparatively smaller distances from the central engine , and so is preferentially affected by microlensing .",
    "this is in agreement with the large changes we detect at progressively shorter wavelengths in our two - epoch spectra of quasar a. conversely , since the near - infrared emission is expected to originate at larger distances from the center than the uv or optical continuum , we expect the longest wavelength band @xmath48 ( originating approximately at @xmath23 band in the quasar rest frame ) to be less affected by microlensing .    on the other hand ,",
    "the bel region is as large as a few light - weeks or light - months ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with lower ionization lines originating at larger distances .",
    "thus , we expect that , in particular , the bel is less prone to microlensing effects .",
    "we find that the spectral flux ratio a / b of the two images ( figure [ fig : spec ] ) shows a decrease at the center of the bel , compared to the surrounding continuum .",
    "this could be indicative of microlensing affecting the continuum , but not the bel .    in principle",
    ", an estimate of the intrinsic flux ratio can be obtained from the flux ratio in the continuum - subtracted bels , since they are less prone to microlensing effects than the continuum fluxes . however ,",
    "in our case there is the chance that differential slit losses , although believed to be small ( see  [ sec : reddening ] ) affect the bels , and therefore we refrain from doing so .",
    "one possible argument against microlensing could be that , since the two galaxies are fairly distant in projection from the quasar pair ( @xmath62 kpc ) , there may be no stars to account for microlensing .",
    "we note that evidence of microlensing has previously been found in both sdss  j1004 + 4112 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sdss  j1029 + 2623 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the two large - separation cluster lenses ; in those cases however , the galaxies believed to host the stars responsible for microlensing are located at slightly smaller projected separations of @xmath93 kpc from the quasar images .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of intrinsic quasar variability using the structure function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein )    @xmath94    this predicts the magnitude change for a quasar of @xmath22 band absolute magnitude @xmath95 , at a given rest frame wavelength @xmath96 in units of  , for a rest frame time interval between observations of @xmath97 ( in days ) .",
    "the structure function has been measured from a quasar sample with @xmath98 to @xmath99 @xcite , in the rest frame optical / uv , and on a rest frame time range of up to 2 years .",
    "we also note that the characteristic time scale for optical variability of quasars is of the order 1 year @xcite , which is comparable with the time delay in the source rest frame ( 0.4 - 2.8 years ) , in our best lensing models .",
    "we use the structure function to check if it can reproduce spectral changes in quasar a of a factor of @xmath100 in flux ( @xmath18 0.75 mag ) , at @xmath101   ( @xmath102   rest frame ) , in the 13 months ( @xmath103 days rest frame ) between the original sdss and the follow - up spectroscopy . using the image magnifications",
    "we obtain from the lensing models ( table [ tab : models ] ) , and the fact that the source rest frame @xmath22 band corresponds to the observed @xmath47 - @xmath48 bands , we estimate the source quasar absolute brightness to be @xmath104 to @xmath105 , depending on the choice of lensing model .",
    "since the structure function is larger for fainter quasars , we use the former value and obtain an upper estimate of @xmath106 ( because this is a magnitude difference , it has the same value in the rest frame as in the magnified , observed - frame ) .",
    "this value is too small to explain the spectral changes at short wavelengths .",
    "we note however that the structure function might be able to explain the flux changes of @xmath107 mag ( @xmath108 ) in both quasars in the @xmath23 band , in @xmath109 years , and it may also introduce flux variations of about 0.26 - 0.23 mag at the observed - frame @xmath46 - @xmath48 bands , during the maximum rest frame time interval of the quasar sample , @xmath110 years .",
    "we point out however that the structure function is a statistical average over a sample of quasars , therefore brightness changes of larger amplitude are not ruled out in individual objects ( magnitude differences larger that 0.75 occur in about 1% of quasars ; @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the spectral shapes of a & b ( in the continua ) are compatible with the gravitational lensing hypothesis , where the differences are caused by differential extinction , microlensing and intrinsic variability .",
    "microlensing and extinction are more important at short wavelengths than intrinsic variability , and slit losses may also contribute to the changes in the spectrum of a. regarding the intrinsic flux ratio , all three spectral flux ratios of the two quasars , which we plotted in figure [ fig : spec ] , are fairly constant in the range 7200 @xmath111 8400   , with a(sdss)/a ( the original sdss spectrum of a divided by the follow - up spectrum of a ) fairly close to 1 , and a / b , a(sdss)/b @xmath18 1.4 .",
    "this latter value is in excellent agreement with the flux ratio we measure in the @xmath112 and @xmath48 bands , where we expect differential extinction and microlensing to be weakest .",
    "together , these results suggest that the intrinsic flux ratio , which would ideally be measured in the far - infrared or radio , is @xmath64 , and all three flux - altering physical factors considered are weak in the 7200 @xmath111 8400   spectral range . here",
    "we chose the error bar on the flux ratio somewhat arbitrarily , slightly larger than the scatter in the flux ratio at 7200 @xmath111 8400  as well as the @xmath112 and @xmath48 bands .",
    "the two quasars were also detected in the mid - infrared by wise @xcite , at almost the same epoch as the subaru moircs @xmath112 and @xmath48 observations .",
    "the flux ratio at 3.4 , 4.6 and 12 @xmath113 m is @xmath114 ( table [ tab : wise ] ) , but we consider this to be broadly consistent with the value above , because the quasars were detected at quite low s / n @xmath115 , and the fluxes were measured by deblended profile fits , at very poor angular resolution ( 6@xmath1161 , 6@xmath1164 , 6@xmath1165 and 12@xmath1160 in the four bands , respectively ) .",
    "there is also the possibility of unknown flux contamination from the two bright galaxies .",
    "the quasar pair also appears to be radio quiet , based on non - detection in the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm survey , which is sensitive to @xmath117 mjy / beam .    in view of the wise data",
    ", we also consider the possibility that the intrinsic flux ratio is @xmath63 ( here we have broadened the scatter in the values measured at at 3.4 , 4.6 and 12 @xmath113 m ) .",
    "this requires that the flux ratio of @xmath87 in the continuum , found in the data redward of the bel , is due to microlensing .",
    "this assumption is still in agreement with the results in  [ sec : microlensing ] , and in particular equation [ eq : tsrc ] , which is an order - of - magnitude estimate . in this interpretation ,",
    "the flux change at long wavelengths occurs on timescales larger than those sampled by our observations , whereas those at shorter wavelengths are noticeable .",
    "this assumption is testable via deeper , high resolution mid - infrared observations , as the mid - infrared emitting region is expected to be too large for microlensing to occur .",
    "this interpretation would also explain why the flux ratio decreases slightly with increasing wavelength between the @xmath47 and @xmath48 bands , reaching unity in the wise bands .",
    "since our attempts to model the system as a two - image gravitationally lensed quasar require a significant additional dark matter component , we next look at the environment of the lens , in order to search for clues to the existence of a possible galaxy cluster .",
    "we proceed by making a color - color diagram of the galaxies in the moircs field of view ( @xmath118 kpc at @xmath2 , centered on sdss  j1320 + 1644 ) , using the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 bands .",
    "we aim to isolate the galaxies that are similar in color to g1 and g2 , and study their spatial distribution around the target .",
    "we use sextractor @xcite to catalogue and match all the objects in the field of view , and we isolate the galaxies by requiring the sextractor stellarity parameter to be less than 0.2 in all three bands .",
    "we eliminate a few galaxies that are very close together , so that aperture photometry would fail , which leads to a sample of 98 galaxies .    from table",
    "[ tab : photometry ] , using the aperture photometry , we determine the colors ( @xmath53 , @xmath119 ) = ( 0.87 @xmath120 0.07 , 0.88 @xmath120 0.05 ) for g1 , and ( 0.87 @xmath120 0.08 , 0.80 @xmath120 0.05 ) for g2 . in color - color space ,",
    "g1 and g2 lie close to each other , and close to the concentration at ( @xmath53 , @xmath119 ) @xmath18 ( 0.9 , 0.7 ) .",
    "thus there may be an excess of galaxies at the redshift of g1 and g2 , indicative of a cluster .",
    "we attempt a color cut at 0.8 @xmath121 1.1 and 0.6 @xmath122 0.9 , which includes the concentration of galaxies as well as g1 and g2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : colorscluster ] ( right ) , we plot the positions of the galaxies selected by this color - cut from the moircs field of view centered on sdss  j1320 + 1644 ; they seem to spatially surround the target .",
    "we caution however that the broad color cut may contain galaxies at different redshift .",
    "a multidimensional color plot would help break the degeneracies , but the uh88 bands , even the deep @xmath23 band , detect only a few of the galaxies visible in the moircs bands and do not allow a systematic treatment .",
    "our analysis therefore hints that g1 and g2 are embedded at the center of a galaxy cluster , which in turn supports the existence of a heavy dark matter halo associated with the cluster , required by our models in  [ sec : mass ] . in  [ sec : discuss - mlratio ] , we provide an estimate of the content of dark matter .",
    "we have reported the discovery as part of the sqls of sdss  j1320 + 1644 , a pair of quasars at @xmath0 with two galaxies in between , in a cross - like configuration .",
    "we have estimated the redshift of the two galaxies as @xmath2 , based on absorption lines observed in the quasar spectra and consistency with the photometric redshifts of the galaxies .",
    "we used the observational constraints to investigate whether the system is a two - image gravitationally lensed quasar or a binary quasar .",
    "we showed that the key to differentiate between the gravitational lens and binary pair hypotheses is whether or not there exists a dark matter halo at the location of the system , capable of boosting the gravitational potential of the galaxies .",
    "we estimated the required virial mass or velocity dispersion of this halo , as well as the expected time delays and image magnifications , using a variety of sis and nfw profiles .",
    "we were also able to show that the halo can only be centered on the brighter , elliptical galaxy g1 or somewhere in between the two quasars ( but not on the disk - like galaxy g2 ) , as well as to set constraints on the velocity dispersions of these two galaxies , and an additional , fainter third galaxy .",
    "the third galaxy may be located at either @xmath2 or @xmath35 . in the first case , it would further support the existence of a halo indicative of a galaxy group or cluster , and in the second it would explain the presence of a strong absorption system in one of the quasars .    we have found a substantial number of galaxies in the field , surrounding the quasar pair , with colors consistent with @xmath2 ( based however on only three filters ) .",
    "if this is a galaxy cluster , the quasar pair would reside behind the center of the cluster potential , which would provide the required dark matter halo lens .",
    "the calculated mass - to - light ratio assuming the lensing hypothesis (  [ sec : discuss - mlratio ] ) is in agreement with what would be expected from a cluster - scale lens .",
    "we have performed a comparative analysis of the spectra of the two quasars ( as well as inferred the intrinsic flux ratio of the two quasars ) , and concluded that all observed differences can be attributed to a combination of extinction , microlensing and intrinsic variability , in support of the gravitational lensing hypothesis , with the microlensing being dominant .",
    "the most similar known system to our target is arguably q0957 + 561 @xcite , which has two quasar images separated by @xmath123 and one lensing galaxy that is part of a confirmed cluster that boosts the image separation .",
    "that system shows , in addition , evidence of strongly lensed arcs , which are the extended images of the lensed quasar host galaxy @xcite .",
    "we conclude that sdss  j1320 + 1644 is a probable gravitationally lensed quasar , although we are unable to prove this beyond doubt , based on our available data .",
    "we propose the following observations as a means of establishing the true nature of this object unambiguously :    1 .",
    "as the most time - effective way of testing the lensing hypothesis , we suggest deep adaptive optics or hubble space telescope observations to study the morphology of the quasar host galaxies , and look for extended arc - like features , characteristic of gravitational lensing .",
    "we note that there is a 16.6 mag ( r band ) star @xmath124 from the target , which could be used as a tip - tilt star for the laser guide star adaptive optics capabilities of subaru telescope .",
    "2 .   deep , wide field optical imaging of the region could be used to detect weak lensing associated with the possible lensing cluster .",
    "3 .   deep x - ray observations would test the presence of the galaxy group / cluster by providing an independent measure of the velocity dispersion of intracluster gas , as well as determining its dynamical center .",
    "spectroscopy of the two brightest galaxies would determine if they are indeed at the same redshift , consistent with the spectral absorption lines , as assumed in our galaxy cluster hypothesis .",
    "these galaxies are faint in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath23 and sdss bands , and therefore the photometric redshifts are fairly uncertain",
    ". multi - object spectroscopy would provide a means to check the redshift of the surrounding galaxies , and therefore either consistently prove or disprove the cluster hypothesis . at the very least , deeper imaging in other bands is required to constrain the photometric redshift of the surrounding galaxies .",
    "long - time monitoring of the quasar fluxes to look for correlated variations ( a time delay ) would convincingly reveal the nature of this system , as long as the correlated variations are not suppressed by microlensing .",
    "although we do not possess sufficient constraints to estimate a robust time delay , our best estimates are @xmath125 years , based on our lensing models .",
    "should this system indeed prove to be a gravitational lens , it would be the third - largest separation gravitationally lensed quasar in the sqls , and the largest separation two - image lensed quasar known .",
    "these large separation lenses are important to include in a complete statistical sample such as the one provided by the sqls @xcite , in order to constrain the hierarchical structure formation at cluster mass scales .",
    "they are also exceedingly rare , because the probability of quasars strongly lensed by clusters is 1 - 2 orders of magnitudes smaller than that of quasars lensed by galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we can treat g4 as an sis lens situated at @xmath2 , but with a smaller effective velocity dispersion .",
    "this eliminates the need to introduce multiple lens planes and is justified by the fact that the convergence from g4 at b ( arbitrarily taken as the object closest to g4 , but projected to @xmath35 ) is as small as @xmath246 ( f - j ) or @xmath247 ( t - f ) , where @xmath248 is the einstein radius of the lens g4 estimated from the velocity dispersion ( assuming an sis profile ) and @xmath249 is the projected angular distance between b and g4 . from @xcite , using @xmath250 ( convergence ) = @xmath251 ( shear ) for the sis profile , the effective convergence of g4 at @xmath2 is @xmath252 ( f - j ) , or @xmath253 ( t - f ) , where @xmath254 , @xmath255 are angular diameter distances , @xmath256 , and o , s refer to the observer and source , respectively .",
    "the effective convergence corresponds to an sis profile at g4 with effective velocity dispersion @xmath257 km s@xmath6 ( f - j ) or @xmath258 km s@xmath6 ( t - f ) .",
    "we conclude that , considering all possibilities , an sis model at @xmath2 for g4 would have a velocity dispersion in the @xmath55 range of @xmath259 km s@xmath6 .      here",
    "we investigate how the choice of the concentration parameter @xmath81 of the nfw profiles affects our results in  [ sec : mass ] .",
    "we explore @xmath81 in the range from 2 to 30 , and we optimize all other model parameters .",
    "increasing @xmath81 has the effect of decreasing the total magnification of the images , and increasing the time delay ( table [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "we plot the resulting @xmath81 - virial mass relation in figure [ fig : cm ] .",
    "we obtain virtually the same degeneracy for the free nfw profile as for the one fixed at g2 . for comparison",
    ", we also plot some recently published results on the @xmath81 - virial mass relation : the results of @xmath260body simulations by @xcite , as well as the theoretical and observational results inferred by @xcite from fitting lensing clusters at @xmath261 . the strong lens selected sample behind the @xcite relations",
    "is known to be biased towards overestimating the concentrations due to halo triaxiality .",
    "if sdss  j1320 + 1644 is indeed a lens system , it should include the same bias , as it is selected as a strong lens .",
    "all these relations are observed to intersect the sdss  j1320 + 1644 curves .",
    "we discuss two caveats .",
    "a first caveat is that , when estimating the range of velocity dispersion for each galaxy in  [ sec : mass ] , we have not taken into account the possible evolution of the t - f and f - j with redshift .",
    "although there is no consensus in the literature in this regard ( e.g. , @xcite & @xcite for t - f , @xcite & @xcite for f - j ) , the tendency is that galaxies had smaller rotational velocities and velocity dispersions in the past for the same luminosity .",
    "this would reduce even more the contribution of the galaxies to the mass models dominated by the dark matter halo .",
    "a second caveat applies to g4 , in the case that this galaxy is located at @xmath35 . in this case",
    ", g4 would also be lensed by the dark matter halo at @xmath2 , and therefore magnified by a factor @xmath262 , depending on the assumed lensing model .",
    "this would mean that the galaxy is intrinsically fainter , and its contribution to the mass models would be further reduced .",
    "on the other hand , the undeflected position of g4 would be closer to the main deflector , increasing its influence .",
    "we have checked that the best - fit models considered in this section ( from which we exclude the contribution of g4 ) would not produce multiple images of this galaxy ( @xmath35 being closer to the redshift of the main lens than @xmath0 , the critical surface density for multiple images is increased ) .",
    "here we compute the mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio by assuming that sdss  j1320 + 1644 is a lensed system , and compare it with the m / l ratio of the other lenses discovered by the sqls @xcite .",
    "we fit each lens with an sis profile , in which case the einstein radius @xmath263 is simply half the image separation . for the quasars with more than two images , we consider @xmath263 to be half the largest separation between the images .",
    "the mass inside the einstein radius is simply determined as      to determine the luminosity of the sqls lenses , we referred to the discovery papers ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and estimated the rest frame r band magnitudes of all the galaxies with available photometry , located between the images , using the hyperz algorithm . to convert the rest frame magnitudes into luminosities we used @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is the r band magnitude of the sun .",
    "the m / l ratios were computed in terms of the solar m / l ratio , @xmath267 = 1 m@xmath268/l@xmath268 .    we attached no error bars to the results of these rough calculations .",
    "not accounting for the effects of lens ellipticity and external shear for each ( mostly double - image ) system should introduce an error of @xmath269 on the masses @xcite . also , the redshifts of several lenses are not accurately known , which influences both the masses and the inferred luminosities .",
    "photometry for most lenses is only available in three bands ( we eliminate 10 objects for which the lens is detected in only one band ) , and their morphology is typically unknown .",
    "it is therefore difficult to choose the appropriate cww spectral template for calculating the rest frame @xmath38 band luminosity .",
    "however we know that the majority of lens galaxies are ellipticals , as these have larger velocity dispersions @xcite , and so we generally assume the elliptical template , unless the lens is known to be a spiral , or the fit of another template is much better . also , luminosities should be more accurate for lenses at @xmath270 0.2 - 0.3 , because at this redshift the rest frame r band is redshifted into the observed - frame @xmath39 band , where observations are usually available . for sdss j1320 + 1644",
    ", the lens redshift estimate means that the rest frame @xmath38 band is redshifted into the j band , where photometry is available .",
    "the results of our m / l estimates are shown in figure [ fig : m / l ] , in which we plot the mass - to - light ratios against the reduced image separations .",
    "the reduced image separation @xmath271 scales out the dependence on the source and lens distance , thus representing a physical property of the lensing object .",
    "the image separation is the most important observable , because it reflects the depth of the gravitational potential of the lensing object and therefore the structure responsible for the lensing phenomenon .",
    "since clusters are dominated by dark matter much more than normal galaxies , we expect that , as the image separation increases from the galaxy lens to the cluster lens range , so does the m / l ratio .",
    "accordingly , the result we obtain in figure [ fig : m / l ] shows a positive correlation between the image separation and m / l .",
    "most small - separation lenses at @xmath272 are clustered at m / l @xmath273 , consistent with the estimates from the dynamics of elliptical galaxies and their stellar populations @xcite , whereas the two known cluster - scale lenses sdss  j1004 + 4112 and sdss  j1029 +",
