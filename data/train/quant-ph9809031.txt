    "in recent years typical optics experiments have been carried over to atoms , among them diffraction by double slits @xcite and by transmission gratings which were produced by nanostructure techniques @xcite .",
    "the usual wave - theoretical methods of classical optics ( huygens , kirchhoff ) seem to give excellent descriptions of these experiments @xcite so that apparently not much more than a good textbook on classical optics seems to be needed .",
    "this simple picture , however , has changed .",
    "recently schllkopf and toennies @xcite have performed impressive diffraction experiments with helium dimers and helium clusters consisting of up to 26 atoms .",
    "a typical diffraction pattern is shown in fig .",
    "the helium dimer he@xmath0 , discovered a few years ago @xcite , has an extremely low binding energy of @xmath1 @xcite , with no excited states .",
    "the binding energy is much smaller than the incident kinetic energy of typical experiments .",
    "its diameter is estimated to be about 6 nm @xcite .",
    "present day slit widths are as low as 50 nm and a further reduction is expected .",
    "when a system is observed at a nonzero diffraction angle it clearly has received a lateral moment transfer from the grating . for weakly bound systems like he@xmath0 or higher clusters this might induce breakup processes which in turn might change the diffraction pattern .",
    "similarly , the size of the bound system may have an influence .",
    "if so , what will be the effect ?",
    "will the diffraction pattern change drastically ?",
    "will the diffraction peaks still be at the same locations as for point particles ? these questions will be investigated and answered in the following , with emphasis on he@xmath0 .",
    "more technical details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "diffraction by a transmission grating really means scattering by the bars of the grating , and to include breakup processes and finite - size effects we use multichannel scattering theory .",
    "we describe the effect of the grating bars by means of a short - range repulsive ( ` reflective ' ) potential",
    ". the possible role of attractive parts to the potential will be discussed at the end . as usual we neglect the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus consider a weakly bound system of _ two _ particles and its scattering by an _ external potential_. due to the presence of the external potential this problem can not be reduced to a one - particle problem but has more resemblance , at least mathematically , to a three - body problem .",
    "in fact , we will show that the faddeev approach to the three - body problem in its formulation by alt , grassberger , and sandhas @xcite can be carried over and adapted to the two - body problem with external potential .",
    "in this section we consider a bound two particle system ( ` molecule ' ) scattered by a quite general obstacle .",
    "the coordinates are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the binding potential is @xmath4 , with negative binding energies @xmath5 and bound states @xmath6 .",
    "the external ( obstacle ) potential is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are short - range and strongly repulsive , representing dirichlet boundary conditions in the limit . for dimers",
    "one has @xmath10 .",
    "we first consider the process @xmath11 from an incoming molecule of momentum @xmath12 and internal state @xmath13 to an outgoing molecule of momentum @xmath14 and internal state @xmath15 , i.e. no breakup .",
    "we introduce the six - dimensional green s operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and similarly @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the free hamiltonian ( kinetic energy ) .",
    "one has the usual resolvent equations @xmath21 the @xmath22 matrices for @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined as @xmath25 writing @xmath26 and similarly for @xmath24 gives @xmath27 we now introduce operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 through @xmath30 as in ref .",
    "@xcite one easily shows that the transition amplitude for the above process is @xmath31 equating eqs .",
    "( [ c ] ) and ( [ e ] ) , @xmath32 and inserting eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) gives @xmath33 similarly , equating eqs .",
    "( [ d ] ) and ( [ f ] ) and inserting eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) gives @xmath34    the last two equations are the ags equations for two particles interacting through a potential @xmath23 and with an additional external potential @xmath24 .",
    "these ags equations decouple here , as seen by insertion of eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , which gives @xmath35    this equation is exact and contains both breakup and finite - size effects .",
    "it lends itself to iteration , and to lowest order in @xmath36 one has @xmath37 by eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) this gives @xmath38 although @xmath39 is the transition operator for scattering of two asymptotically free particles by the external potential @xmath24 it is not on the energy shell in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) . here",
    "the interaction @xmath23 is taken into account through the wave - functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) one can show that @xmath42 is the transition operator for breakup processes , and for this one only has to know @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "2 we have plotted @xmath60 for he@xmath0 and the corresponding quantity for a point particle . the bar width is 25 nm . for a symmetric grating of period 50",
    "nm the vertical lines in the inset indicate where the peaks of the grating functions cut out the diffraction peaks of first order , second order and so on . for a symmetric grating and point particles",
    "there are no even - order diffraction peaks since the single - bar amplitude vanishes there , as seen in the inset . for the dimer",
    "this is not true , and it therefore has small even - order peaks which become more pronounced for smaller bar and slit widths .    intuitively we expect that finite - size effects of he@xmath0 might be partially taken into account by a larger bar and smaller slit width .",
    "3 shows that the single - bar amplitude of he@xmath0 , for a bar width of 25  nm , can be approximated for small lateral momentum transfer by that of a point particle for bar width of ( 25 + 2.8 )  nm . for",
    "a grating this would mean a nonsymmetric grating of correspondingly smaller slit width .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath61 for the ground - state wave - function of he@xmath0 we are using is just 2.8  nm .",
    "a cumulant expansion of @xmath57 shows that the equality of these two numbers is not a coincidence @xcite .",
    "can one understand more directly and intuitively why the diffraction peaks occur at the same locations as for point particles of the same lateral momentum transfer ?",
    "this is easy to see if one accepts that @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) is negligible and that one just has to add the amplitudes from the individual bars .",
    "indeed , the potential of the @xmath63th bar is the translate @xmath64 of the first bar potential , and similarly for the @xmath63th bar transition amplitude @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath66 is an eigenvector of the momentum operator @xmath67 , the associated amplitude differs just by the phase factor @xmath68 from that of the first bar .",
    "summation over @xmath63 leads to a sum over the phase factors , resulting in the grating function and eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "there is also a symmetry argument for an infinite grating , exact to all orders and holding for larger clusters , too . for an infinite grating the complete hamiltonian has period @xmath46 under translations in the 2 direction .",
    "hence the hamiltonian as well as the associated time - development operator @xmath69 commute with @xmath70 . as",
    "a consequence @xmath71 must vanish unless @xmath72 and thus there are only transitions in these directions .",
    "we recall that experimentally one always has a certain momentum spread and that only a part of the grating is illuminated by the incoming beam . to take this into account one",
    "can modify the above plane - wave formulation and it allows one to let @xmath45 become arbitrarily large @xcite .",
    "the momentum spread then just leads to a broadening of the diffraction peaks .",
    "incidentally , this procedure yields the correct height for the zeroth - order peak which otherwise would be misrepresented by a finite grating illuminated by an infinite plane wave . figs .",
    "4 and 5 show some results .",
    "recent experiments by schllkopf and toennies @xcite have shown that an additional attractive potential may have an unexpectedly large influence on the diffraction patterns for higher noble atoms , increasing from neon to argon to krypton , in line with the increasing polarizability of these atoms .",
    "this attractive potential will also influence the diffraction pattern of bound systems to some extent .    in a first step we have taken this additional surface potential into account for diffraction of atoms .",
    "this can be done by using similar resolvent methods as in section 2 , with the surface potential treated as a perturbation . in the course of this something interesting happened . at first",
    "our results did not even qualitatively agree with the experiments for higher noble atoms  in particular the hierarchy of the peaks did not come out correctly  until we learned that due to the etching process the cross section of the grating bars was not rectangular as assumed by us but rather trapeze - like , with the angle off the perpendicular by @xmath73 . using this geometry agreement with the experiments",
    "was then obtained @xcite .",
    "this , incidentally , shows the sensitivity of the theoretical methods .",
    "the next step is to take the attractive surface potential into account for helium dimers .",
    "this work is presently in progress .",
    "another interesting topic is to use the cumulant expansion mentioned in the last section to obtain some measure of the ` size ' of he@xmath0 from diffraction data and to obtain consequences for the binding potential .    in principle",
    "it should be possible to carry the approach of section 2 over to three particles with external potential and apply it to the helium trimer , he@xmath74 . in this connection",
    "a very interesting question is whether one can draw any conclusions from he@xmath74 diffraction patterns for the theoretically predicted efimov state of he@xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we have used few - body methods to investigate the diffraction of weakly bound two - particle systems by a transmission grating and have obtained explicit expressions for the transition amplitude in the elastic channel .",
    "the diffraction pattern is a product of the single - bar amplitude @xmath57 and the usual grating function . as for point particles our result depends only on @xmath75 and on the bar width .",
    "the zeros of @xmath57 may differ from those for point particles so that even - order diffraction peaks may appear for symmetric gratings .    for large bar and slit widths ( @xmath76 bound - state diameter )",
    "the diffraction pattern is still very close to that for point particles , although minor deviations exist ( second order peak ) . for smaller bar and slit widths ( @xmath77 diameter )",
    "significant deviations occur .",
    "the third order peak can be up to 40% lower .",
    "this can be attributed to breakups which should increase for larger momentum transfer .",
    "there is also an appreciable second order peak which is absent for point particles .",
    "this is more difficult to understand by breakups and is rather a finite - size effect since the finite size can be partially taken into account by considering point particles and a nonsymmetric grating with smaller slit widths .",
    "extension to helium trimers seems feasible , with a possible connection to efimov states .",
