    "the search for the ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) sources is one of the most interesting problems of modern astroparticle physics .",
    "the observation of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite in the energy spectrum by hires experiment  @xcite proves the astrophysical origin of uhecr .",
    "several classes of astrophysical sources can potentially accelerate cosmic rays to the highest energies  @xcite , but some of them are restricted by different energy losses in the sources ( for a recent review see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also , for each class of sources , several alternative acceleration mechanisms were suggested , including standard first order fermi acceleration in shocks or acceleration in induced electric fields in the polar regions of supermassive black holes  @xcite .    accelerated cosmic rays",
    "lose their energy during the propagation from the sources to the earth due to pion production , e@xmath4 pair production and redshifting .",
    "these energy losses define the horizon - the typical distance from which cosmic rays can reach us with a final energy bigger than some value .",
    "the horizon value was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the constant energy loss approximation .",
    "it was updated to realistic stochastic energy losses in ref .",
    "finally , the effects of the experimental energy resolution were taken into account in  @xcite .",
    "both for protons and iron nuclei , 70% of sources would be located within 70  mpc of the earth for energies e  @xmath0  10@xmath5  ev , and within 250  mpc of the earth for e  @xmath0  6  @xmath1  10@xmath2  ev .",
    "since the large scale structure ( lss ) is still anisotropic on 100 - 200  mpc scales , any class of astrophysical sources of uhecr should give an anisotropic signal in detectors with typical angular scales of tens of degrees .",
    "anisotropies on medium scales , 20 - 30 degrees , have been found previously by combining all the available data of `` old '' cosmic ray experiments  @xcite .",
    "such anisotropies were predicted as a consequence of the observed lss of matter  @xcite and favor therefore , with the presence of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff , the extragalactic origin of uhecrs .",
    "these results still did not allow to find the sources of uhecr , both due to limited statistics and to the fact that any different class of astrophysical sources is located in the same lss , which makes their identification more difficult .",
    "another important factor which complicates the detection of cosmic ray sources is the deflection of uhecr in the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "extragalactic fields are unknown outside of galaxy clusters .",
    "the numerical simulations done by several groups predict a wide range of deflections for 10@xmath5  ev protons . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , deflections are negligible ( @xmath6  1@xmath7 in 98% of the sky within 100  mpc of the earth ) . on the contrary , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , deflections are more than 10  degrees in 70% of the sky . in this case , the search for the uhecr sources is extremely difficult and close to impossible , even for proton primaries . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the deflections in the extragalactic magnetic fields are small , following the results of ref .",
    "let us note that if the sources are located in regions with high values of magnetic fields , like galaxy clusters , both their spectrum and their detected flux can be affected by magnetic lensing effects in the cluster  @xcite .",
    "below , we assume that one can neglect such effects .    even in case the extragalactic magnetic fields are negligible , uhecr would still be deflected in the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) .",
    "for the gmf , the situation is much better due to existing measurements of both the regular and the turbulent components of this field .",
    "however , there is no theoretical model of the gmf which can fit all existing data .",
    "the measured values of the gmf still allow to estimate the typical deflections of uhecr in it , which are @xmath8  0.5 - 2  degrees for protons of energies equal to 10@xmath5  ev , depending on the position on the sky and on the gmf model .",
    "there are two possible ways to continue the search for the uhecr sources in the near future .",
    "one is to look at the highest energies only , e  @xmath0  6  @xmath1  10@xmath2  ev , and collect enough statistics to find point sources .",
    "this method can be strongly affected by the presence of a large fraction of nuclei in the uhecr flux .    in this paper",
    ", we present another way to search for individual bright sources .",
    "one can hope that the regular gmf gives the major contribution to uhecr deflections .",
    "then , one can try to look near high energy events for low energy tails on top of a high background of uhecr , which comes from all unresolved proton sources and from heavy nuclei . in the present paper ,",
    "we suggest a new method which is based on searching for low energy tails near doublets or clusters of events with high energies , e  @xmath0  10@xmath9  ev @xmath8  6.3  @xmath1  10@xmath2  ev .",
    "this allows us to reduce the background significantly , compared to usual searches for tails near every single high energy event .",
    "we simulated the signals from a single source and from a background of uhecr .",
    "following the results of hires  @xcite , we take a proton source , except in a paragraph of section  [ results ] , where we investigate some possible extensions of this work to sources of heavier nuclei .",
    "then , we studied how the probability to detect this source depends on unknown parameters of the source and of the magnetic field . in case",
    "the source is detected , we finally reconstruct its position on the sky and the local deflection power of the regular gmf .    in section  [ simulation ] , we simulate the signal from a single source on top of background . section  [ sectionmethod ] depicts the method used to detect the source and reconstruct its position . in section  [ results ] , we test how its efficiency varies with experimental or unknown physical parameters . in section  [ summary ] , we summarize our results .",
