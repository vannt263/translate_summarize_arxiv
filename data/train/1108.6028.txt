    "einstein based the development of general relativity on two pillars : general covariance and the equivalence principle . since then , physicists have often wondered whether there are any alternatives to general relativity , which , while preserving its theoretical framework and phenomenological successes also avoid some of the shortcomings sometimes attributed to it . among the phenomenological successes of general relativity , the equivalence principle  the proportionality of inertial and gravitational mass  is the most accurately tested and constrained one .",
    "indeed , experiments at the university of washington limit the relative difference in acceleration towards the earth of two test spheres of different atomic compositions to be less than one part in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore , any putative alternative theory of gravitation has to pass the significant hurdle of the equivalence principle .",
    "arguably , the simplest way to modify general relativity is to add a scalar field to the gravitational sector .",
    "since gravitation is a long - ranged interaction , such a scalar would have to be sufficiently light to be considered part of the gravitational field .",
    "whereas it is straightforward to include such a scalar field while preserving diffeomorphism invariance , the most general diffeomorphism - invariant theory with a light scalar would generically lead to strong violations of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "there is nevertheless a subclass of scalar - tensor theories which respect the weak form of the equivalence principle , at least at tree level , and thus provides a natural class of phenomenologically viable alternatives to general relativity .",
    "( as shown by nordtvedt @xcite , theories in this class do violate the strong equivalence principle , although these violations are negligible in laboratory - sized experiments . )",
    "the first such theory was proposed by pascual jordan @xcite , after criticism by fierz @xcite of an earlier proposal of the former @xcite .",
    "essentially the same theory was later revived by brans and dicke @xcite , whose names are usually associated with the class of scalar - tensor theories we study here .",
    "further extensions and generalizations within this class were later considered by different authors @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes these weak equivalence principle - preserving scalar - tensor theories is the existence of a formulation of the theory  a conformal frame  in which the scalar field only couples to gravity ( at tree level ) .",
    "it follows then , by construction , that these theories preserve the weak equivalence principle classically , since their matter sector is the same as that of general relativity .",
    "of course , the question is what happens to the equivalence principle when quantum fluctuations are turned on , and , more generally , whether quantum corrections preserve the structure of this subclass of scalar - tensor theories .",
    "this is not just a purely academic question , because even planck - suppressed interactions eventually generated by loops would lead to departures from the weak equivalence principle that are experimentally ruled out .",
    "the question is most conveniently addressed in the einstein conformal frame of these theories , in which the propagators of the graviton and the scalar are diagonal .",
    "although in this frame the scalar couples directly to matter , it is easy to check that the equivalence principle is preserved at tree level .",
    "however , because the field couples directly to matter , it is hard to see why quantum corrections would not lead to violations of the equivalence principle .    the impact of quantum corrections on the equivalence principle has been the subject of a small but interesting debate in the literature . in the first article on the topic",
    "we were able to find , fujii argued that quantum corrections should violate the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "he explicitly calculated one - loop quantum corrections to the vertex for scalar emission by a photon , with matter fields running inside the loop , and argued that the latter do seem to violate the equivalence principle .",
    "but somewhat later the same author realized that this purported violation disappears if one employs dimensional regularization instead of a cut - off @xcite .",
    "unaware of these results , cho also argued that the equivalence principle should be violated in scalar - tensor theories @xcite , though some of his arguments seemed to be in conflict with the explicit calculation performed by fujii in @xcite .",
    "up to that point , whether or why quantum corrections preserve the equivalence principle remained unclear , to say the least .",
    "recently , hui and nicolis have shed more light on the issue by providing explicit examples for _ massive _ fields showing that matter loops do not lead to violations of the weak equivalence principle in scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "they argue that this is due to the linear coupling of the scalar to the trace of the energy momentum tensor : because the energy - momentum tensor is conserved , the scalar couples to a charge density given by the time - time component of the energy - momentum tensor , which they identify with the mass density .    in this article",
    "we extend these arguments further .",
    "as we shall see , the equivalence principle in scalar - tensor theories has a two - fold origin : a broken weyl symmetry that relates the couplings of the scalar to those of the graviton , and diffeomorphism invariance , which significantly constrains the couplings of the graviton ( and demands in particular that the latter couple to a conserved quantity , the energy - momentum tensor . )",
    "diffeomorphism invariance implies that in the limit of zero momentum transfer the vertex for graviton emission by matter ",
    "the gravitational mass  has to be proportional to the inertial mass @xcite , and it is the broken weyl symmetry what makes the couplings to the scalar inherit that property .",
    "moreover , because this weyl symmetry is broken , there is a corresponding ward identity for the broken symmetry that exactly predicts the size of those quantum corrections that violate the equivalence principle : they have to be proportional to three inverse powers of the gravitational couplings .",
    "the scalar - tensor theories we are about to study are characterized by the existence of a conformal frame , the jordan frame , in which bosonic matter is minimally coupled to the spacetime metric .",
    "out of all possible scalar - tensor theories , this restriction singles out a very specific class of theories in which the weak equivalence principle holds , at least classically .    by definition ,",
    "the gravitational sector of any scalar - tensor theory consists of a scalar @xmath1 and a rank two symmetric tensor @xmath2 , the metric .",
    "our universe contains fermionic fields however , and this conventional formulation has to be replaced by one in terms of the scalar @xmath1 and the vierbein @xmath3 ( see @xcite for a review . ) in this language , the scalar - tensor theories we consider here have an action functional @xmath4 + s^j_m[e_\\mu{}^a,\\psi_\\alpha],\\ ] ] where the index @xmath5 denotes jordan frame quantities , @xmath6 is a set of matter fields and @xmath7 is the ricci scalar associated with the metric @xmath8 note that we work in an arbitrary number of dimensions @xmath9 , and that matter is now minimally coupled to the vierbein field , which is what singles out the class of theories we consider in this article .",
    "to some extent the dynamics of the gravitational sector are unimportant ; our considerations can be easily generalized to even more general forms of the gravitational sector of the action .",
    "the action ( [ eq : s jf ] ) is invariant under two symmetry groups : diffeomorphisms and local lorentz transformations .",
    "because any spacetime tensor can be converted into a diffeomorphism scalar by contraction with the vierbein , we can assume that all matter fields are diffeomorphism scalars .",
    "in that case , under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms @xmath10 the fields of the theory transform according to    [ eq : diffs ] @xmath11    under local lorentz transformations @xmath12 the different fields transform in the corresponding representation of the lorentz group ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the linear representation of the lorentz group under which the matter fields transform .",
    "our goal is to investigate the gravitational interactions experienced by the different matter fields . in the quantum theory",
    "these interactions are mediated by the interchange of gravitons and scalar particles .",
    "however , in the action ( [ eq : s jf ] ) the graviton and scalar propagators are typically not diagonal .",
    "hence , it is convenient and customary to introduce a new set of variables in terms of which the propagators become diagonal .",
    "this set of new variables define what is usually known as the einstein frame , in which the action reads    [ eq : s ef ] @xmath15+s_\\phi[e_\\mu{}^a,\\phi ]      + s^e_m[f(\\phi / m)e_\\mu{}^a,\\psi_\\alpha],\\ ] ] where @xmath16.\\ ] ]    of course , the choice of conformal frame is a matter of convenience , and both ( [ eq : s jf ] ) and ( [ eq : s ef ] ) are physically equivalent , as recognized early on by dicke @xcite ( in the quantum theory , the equivalence follows from the invariance of @xmath17-matrix elements under field redefinitions . ) for convenience and simplicity we take however ( [ eq : s ef ] ) as the starting point of our considerations .",
    "we also assume that the equations of motion admit a solution with constant value @xmath18 of the scalar field , which for simplicity we take to be @xmath19 , and at this minimum we define @xmath20 if both @xmath21 and @xmath22 differ from zero , we may assume without loss of generality the normalization conditions @xmath23 note that in @xmath9 spacetime dimensions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 do not have mass dimension one .",
    "instead they have the same mass dimension as the scalar and the graviton .      recall that the weak equivalence principle states that in a gravitational field all neutral test bodies fall with the same acceleration , or , more simply , that gravitational and inertial mass are proportional to each other . to see how the equivalence principle emerges in the classical theory defined by the action ( [ eq : s ef m ] ) , consider the tree - level diagram in figure [ fig : tree scalar exchange].1 , in which two different matter particles scatter through scalar exchange on a minkowski background .",
    "the amplitude of the diagram in figure [ fig : tree scalar exchange].1 is , each external line contributes a factor of @xmath26 , and the relation between s - matrix elements and the amplitudes @xmath27 for an initial state @xmath28 and a final state @xmath29 is @xmath30 .",
    "see the next subsections for additional information on our conventions for vertices and propagators . ]",
    "@xmath31       \\,\\frac{1}{q^2+m_\\phi^2}\\ ,      [ u^\\dagger_\\beta ( p'_b ) \\gamma_\\phi^{\\beta\\alpha } u_\\alpha ( p_b)],\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the tree - level amplitude for scalar emission by matter , the @xmath33 are the appropriate mode functions for the external particles , @xmath34 is the momentum transfer , and @xmath35 is the scalar propagator .",
    "we are interested here in the potential energy between two static bodies , that is , on a scalar whose four - momentum @xmath36 approaches zero : @xmath37 .",
    "inspection of the way @xmath1 enters the action ( [ eq : s ef m ] ) reveals that in flat spacetime the scalar vertex @xmath38 is related to the vertex for graviton emission @xmath39 by @xmath40 where we have used equation ( [ eq : f normalization ] ) .",
    "the graviton vertex @xmath41 is proportional to the quadratic component of the energy momentum tensor in flat space , so equation ( [ eq : phi h ] ) is just roughly the statement that the scalar couples to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor ( the factor of two stems from the identification of the vierbein as  half \" a graviton ) .",
    "as we shall see , it follows from diffeomorphism invariance alone that in momentum space , and in the limit of zero momentum transfer , this tree - level graviton vertex has to be of the form @xmath42 where a parenthesis next to an index denotes symmetrization , @xmath43 is the momentum of matter , and @xmath44 is the tree - level self - energy , that is , minus the inverse of the tree - level propagator . the reader can easily verify this relation in the cases of a scalar , a spin half fermion and spin one vector .",
    "hence , because of equation ( [ eq : phi h ] ) , an analogous relation applies for the amplitude for scalar emission , @xmath45 which , again , can be checked independently for scalars , spinors and vectors . on shell ,",
    "the self - energy @xmath46 vanishes by definition .",
    "contracting then equation ( [ eq : ward phi tree ] ) with the appropriate mode functions we find for all three types of matter fields that , on shell , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the inertial mass of the particle , defined to be the value of @xmath49 at the zero of the self - energy , and we have also used that for free fields of arbitrary spin @xmath50 in particular , note that equation ( [ eq : ward tree c ] ) implies that massless particles do not couple to the scalar at tree level , even if the field lagrangian is not conformally invariant , as happens for instance for a massless scalar . hence , the scalar interaction does not contribute to the bending of light , and the experimental constraints on the eddington parameter @xmath51 thus demand that the scalar interaction be much weaker than gravity , @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "finally , substituting equation ( [ eq : ward tree c ] ) into ( [ eq : tree m ] ) and taking the limit of non - relativistic massive particles , @xmath53 , we arrive at @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are , respectively , the inertial masses of particles @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    as we mentioned above , we want to calculate the potential energy for two static bodies , at fixed spatial distance @xmath59 in @xmath60 spacetime dimensions .",
    "to this end , we simply need to fourier transform the non - relativistic limit of the scattering amplitude ( [ eq : mphi ] ) back to real space . since in the non - relativistic limit @xmath61 , we obtain @xmath62 hence , the force mediated by the scalar @xmath1 is proportional to the inertial mass , with a proportionality factor @xmath63 that is universal : the scalar interaction respects the weak equivalence principle .    of course , if we calculate the potential energy due to graviton exchange , we also find that the latter respects the weak equivalence principle .",
    "as before , on shell , using equations ( [ eq : ward tree q=0 ] ) and ( [ eq : identity lorentz ] ) we find @xmath64 since with our conventions the graviton propagator in @xmath9 spacetime dimensions ( say , in de  donder gauge ) is @xmath65_{\\mu\\nu,\\rho\\sigma } = \\frac{- 4i } { ( 2\\pi)^d q^2 } \\left\\ {   \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\eta_{\\mu\\rho}\\eta_{\\nu\\sigma } + \\eta_{\\mu\\sigma}\\eta_{\\nu\\rho}\\right )   - \\frac{1}{d-2 } \\ , \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\eta_{\\rho\\sigma }   \\right\\}\\ ] ] we obtain in the non - relativistic limit that the amplitude associated with the diagram in figure [ fig : tree scalar exchange].2 in @xmath60 is @xmath66 again , the amplitude is proportional to the inertial masses of both particles , with a proportionality constant @xmath67 that is universal .",
    "the origin of this result is the tree - level ward - takahashi identity ( [ eq : ward tree q=0 ] ) .",
    "the latter relates emission of a graviton  the gravitational mass  to the self - energy of matter  the inertial mass .",
    "it just so happens that , due to the structure of the matter action in ( [ eq : s ef m ] ) , the scalar couplings  inherit \" this ward identity , ultimately leading to the preservation of the weak equivalence principle in the scalar sector ( at tree level ) .",
    "we explore whether these features survive in the quantum theory next .      for the purpose of quantization",
    ", it shall prove to be useful to work with the quantum effective action @xmath68 , the sum of all one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) diagrams with a given number of external lines . in order to calculate the effective action , we expand the fields in quantum fluctuations around a given ( but arbitrary ) background .",
    "we thus write    @xmath69    where overbars denote background values , and deltas quantum fluctuations . plugging equation ( [ eq : delta e ] ) into ( [ eq : g ] )",
    "we find @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( note that the location of the vierbein indices is important . ) hence , the symmetric part of the vierbein fluctuations , @xmath72 , is the graviton field ; its antisymmetric part @xmath73 is non - dynamical @xcite .",
    "it follows then by definition that @xmath74    as in any non - abelian gauge theory , we quantize the theory defined by ( [ eq : s ef ] ) using the functional integral formalism . because the action ( [ eq : s ef ] ) is invariant under two groups of local symmetries ( diffeomorphisms and lorentz transformations ) , we need to fix both gauges and introduce the corresponding ghost fields .",
    "hence , our total action becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 is given in equation ( [ eq : s eh phi ] ) , @xmath77 is the gauge - fixing term , and @xmath78 the action for the ghosts . in the background field method ,",
    "the gauge fixing term is such that the total action @xmath79 in equation ( [ eq : s tot ] ) is invariant under a set of symmetries in which the background fields transform like the fields themselves , that is , under equations ( [ eq : diffs ] ) . for concreteness , and following @xcite",
    ", we impose the de  donder ( harmonic ) gauge condition to fix the diffeomorphism gauge , and an algebraic term to fix the lorentz frame , @xmath80.\\ ] ] with this choice of gauge fixing , the action for the diffeomorphism ghosts @xmath81 and the lorentz ghosts @xmath82 becomes @xmath83 .\\ ] ]    we employ dimensional regularization , which preserves the gauge symmetries of the theory while rendering the theory finite .",
    "the effective action is the path integral over these fluctuations , with the prescribed values of the background fields kept fixed , @xmath84)\\equiv      \\int_{1pi }      \\mathcal{d}\\delta e \\",
    ", \\mathcal{d}\\delta \\phi\\ , \\mathcal{d}\\delta\\psi \\ ,      \\mathcal{d}\\zeta\\ , \\mathcal{d}\\theta \\ ,      \\exp[is_\\mathrm{tot}].\\ ] ] the integral is restricted to run only over all one - particle - irreducible vacuum diagrams .",
    "the end result of this construction is that the effective action remains invariant under diffeomorphisms and lorentz transformations , even though these symmetries had to be broken to define the path integral .",
    "consider now the scattering of two distinguishable particles described by the matter fields @xmath6 ( and their adjoints @xmath85 when appropriate ) .",
    "restricting ourselves to interactions mediated by the vierbein and the scalar , these are determined by the two diagrams in figure [ fig : long range ] , the counterparts of the two tree - level diagrams of figure [ fig : tree scalar exchange ] . in real space , the 1pi vertices are given by functional derivatives of the quantum effective action evaluated at vanishing field fluctuations .",
    "in particular , in view of ( [ eq : metric fluctuations ] ) and ( [ eq : h a ] ) , the irreducible vertices for emission of a graviton and a scalar by matter are @xmath86 while the self - energies of the graviton and the scalar ( minus the inverse of their propagator ) are given by @xmath87 these functional derivatives are evaluated in a minkowski spacetime background with vanishing scalar and matter fields , @xmath88 though we do not make this explicit ( it should be clear from the context . ) if , aside from the vierbein , the background does not contain any lorentz vectors , the variational derivative @xmath89 vanishes as a consequence of lorentz invariance .",
    "therefore , there is no need to consider diagrams with one incoming scalar and one outgoing graviton .",
    "note that the cubic vertices above describe the couplings of unrenormalized fields . to calculate physical scattering amplitudes we have to multiply these amplitudes with the appropriate wave function renormalization constants .",
    "scattering amplitudes are typically calculated in momentum space , so it is convenient to work with the momentum - space vertices and self - energies defined above . in our conventions ,",
    "one of the vertex momenta is incoming ( @xmath90 ) , the other two ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) are outgoing , and a momentum - conserving delta function has been split off , @xmath93 in this way , the scattering amplitude is given by @xmath94 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the momentum transfer and the @xmath96 have been contracted with the appropriate mode functions for the matter fields , @xmath97 the potential energy is determined by the values of the irreducible vertices and propagators at zero momentum transfer , @xmath98 . using the definition of potential energy and the fourier transform in ( [ eq : v ] ) , the gravitational potential in @xmath60 becomes @xmath99,\\ ] ] where we have used the spectral representation for the scalar propagator , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively are the residues of the scalar and graviton propagators .",
    "we assume that @xmath102 is much larger than the scales @xmath103 under consideration , so that we can think of the force mediated by @xmath1 effectively as a long - ranged interaction ( we do not consider the chameleon mechanism here @xcite . )",
    "what matters for our purposes is that the potential energy is determined by the vertices for scalar and graviton emission , and , therefore , the latter dictate the fate of the equivalence principle in the quantum theory .",
    "because the quantum effective action is invariant under diffeomorphisms , it satisfies a set of ward - takahashi identities that relate the full vertex for graviton emission @xmath104 to the full matter self - energy @xmath105 , as we shall derive next .",
    "these ward identities are ultimately responsible for the validity of the equivalence principle in the quantum theory , as far as the couplings of matter to the graviton are concerned .",
    "the origin of the ward identity for graviton emission is that the vierbein transforms non - trivially under diffeomorphisms , even for a trivial vierbein background ( flat spacetime . )",
    "this is why diffeomorphism invariance strongly restricts the couplings of matter to the graviton .",
    "in particular , it is possible to derive the weak equivalence principle in @xmath17-matrix theory solely from the requirement that @xmath17-matrix elements be invariant under diffeomorphisms acting on the polarization vectors of the graviton @xcite .",
    "the case of scalar emission however is quite different .",
    "the existence of a scalar field @xmath1 coupled to matter does not require nor entail any particular symmetry . in particular , because the change in the scalar field @xmath1 under diffeomorphisms vanishes at zero background field , diffeomorphisms have nothing to say about the couplings of the scalar to matter .",
    "this is why there is no a priori reason to expect that the couplings of the scalar field to matter respect the equivalence principle in the quantum theory .",
    "in fact they do not , as we also show further below . nevertheless , because the scalar field only couples to matter in the combination @xmath106 , its couplings inherit the ward identity satisfied by the graviton to all orders in the matter coupling constants .",
    "our first goal is to derive the ward identity for graviton emission .",
    "such an identity was proven for arbitrary bosonic matter fields by dewitt in @xcite , following the derivation in @xcite for scalar matter .",
    "we basically extend here dewitt s derivation to the vierbein formulation of the theory .",
    "let us consider the self - energy of the matter fields @xmath6 in the presence of a background vierbein and a background scalar , and a vertex with an additional vierbein line , @xmath107 because the effective action is invariant under diffeomorphisms it does not change under the infinitesimal transformation ( [ eq : diffs ] ) , @xmath108=0.\\ ] ] therefore , acting on this equation with two functional derivatives with respect to the matter fields we obtain @xmath109=0.\\ ] ] using the transformation ( [ eq : diffs ] ) and the definitions ( [ eq : pi ] ) , and evaluating the last equation in our background ( [ eq : background ] ) we then get @xmath110      + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu } \\left[\\xi^\\mu(x )   \\pi^{\\beta\\alpha}(y , x)\\right]=0.\\ ] ] in momentum space , with our momentum conventions ( [ eq : momentum conventions ] ) , this becomes the identity @xmath111 which in the limit of zero momentum transfer @xmath112 and after symmetrization reduces to the ward - takahashi identity for graviton emission , @xmath113 an analogous identity holds in electromagnetism .",
    "the self - energy is the sum of the tree - level contribution @xmath114 and the sum of all one - particle - irreducible self - energy diagrams , and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is what is usually called the self - energy insertion @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath117 , @xmath118 it is convenient to work in renormalized perturbation theory , with fields whose self - energy corrections vanish on shell , and whose propagators have unit residue at the corresponding pole , @xmath119 the irreducible vertex @xmath120 is also the sum of the tree contribution @xmath121 and the contribution from loop diagrams @xmath122 , @xmath123 because the ward identity ( [ eq : ward q=0 ] ) is merely an expression of diffeomorphism invariance , it also holds in the limit in which all coupling constants of the theory go to zero , in which we can approximate all quantum amplitudes by tree - level expressions .",
    "hence , the tree vertex and the tree - level self - energy obey the identity ( [ eq : ward tree q=0 ] ) , the tree - level counterpart of equation ( [ eq : ward q=0 ] ) , as the reader can explicitly check .",
    "we are ready now to derive the main result of this subsection . substituting equations ( [ eq : pi decomposition ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma decomposition ] ) into the ward - takahashi identity ( [ eq : ward q=0 ] ) , using the tree - level relation ( [ eq : ward tree q=0 ] ) , and going on shell , equations ( [ eq : os ] ) ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath124 on shell , and in the limit of zero - momentum transfer , quantum corrections to the gravitational vertex vanish .",
    "since , as we have seen in subsection [ sec : the weak equivalence principle ] , tree - level ( classical ) amplitudes do respect the equivalence principle , so do the quantum corrected ones . as before",
    ", this result has an analogous counterpart in electromagnetism , which guarantees the non - renormalization of the electric charge ( up to an overall wave function renormalization constant ) at zero momentum transfer .",
    "let us turn our attention now to the emission of a scalar by matter .",
    "although there is no analogous ward identity for scalar emission , because of the structure of the couplings of @xmath1 to matter the vertex for scalar emission is closely related to that for graviton emission , whose properties it partially inherits . to see this , note that the matter action @xmath125 in ( [ eq : s ef m ] ) is invariant under the set of infinitesimal transformations    [ eq : redef ] @xmath126    where @xmath127 is an arbitrary function on spacetime . for certain functions @xmath128 , namely , exponentials ,",
    "this transformation can be promoted to a group of @xmath129 transformations that act on @xmath1 by a shift , and on the vierbein by a weyl transformation . in that particular case ,",
    "the transformations ( [ eq : redef ] ) are linear in the fields , though , in general , the transformation ( [ eq : e redef ] ) is non - linearly realized .",
    "whatever the case , if ( [ eq : redef ] ) were an exact , linearly - realized , global symmetry of the full action we would get , plugging the transformation rules ( [ eq : redef ] ) into the general identity ( [ eq : general identity ] ) , and evaluating at our background ( [ eq : background ] ) @xmath130=0,\\ ] ] where we have used that linear symmetries of the action are symmetries of the effective action .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : vertices ] ) and ( [ eq : self - energies ] ) this would lead immediately to the zero momentum identity @xmath131 which relates the vertex for scalar emission to that for graviton emission .",
    "since the latter satisfies equation ( [ eq : ward q=0 ] ) it would then follow in the limit of zero momentum transfer that @xmath132 and , as in the graviton case , using the tree - level relation ( [ eq : ward phi tree ] ) this would finally yield @xmath133 which states that quantum corrections to the scalar vertex in the limit of zero - momentum transfer vanish . since the tree - level scalar vertex does respect the equivalence principle , so would quantum corrections .",
    "note that if , in addition , the transformation ( [ eq : redef ] ) were a local symmetry , we would be able to eliminate @xmath1 altogether from the theory by choosing the appropriate gauge .",
    "but , of course , the full action is not invariant under the global transformation ( [ eq : redef ] ) , and moreover , in general , the transformation ( [ eq : redef ] ) is non - linear . from this point of view ,",

    "the key of this result is that the correction term proportional to the energy - momentum tensor of matter is at least proportional to @xmath1 .",
