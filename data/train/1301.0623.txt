    "assuming general relativity to be valid on all scales , data ranging from the cosmic microwave background to individual galaxies point towards a universe dominated by dark energy and dark matter , the nature of these being most certainly amongst the deepest problems of modern physics .",
    "while dark energy is well - represented by a cosmological constant @xmath0 in einstein s field equations , the currently preferred dark matter candidate is a collection of stable , neutral , elementary particles that condensed from the thermal bath of the early universe , and which are known as ` cold dark matter ' ( cdm ) particles ( see , e.g. , frenk & white 2012 , strigari 2012 for recent reviews ) . on galaxy scales , however , predictions of this standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model , although plagued by the enormous complications of baryonic astrophysics , are difficult to reconcile with observations .",
    "we hereafter review these challenges for the @xmath0cdm model , and point out that some of them hint at a richer and more complex physics of the dark sector than currently assumed .",
    "in particular , many observed scaling relations involve the ubiquitous appearance of an acceleration constant @xmath1 , whose origin is a deep mystery in the standard context .",
    "surprisingly , most of these scaling relations can be summarized by the empirical formula of milgrom ( 1983 ) .",
    "the success of this formula means that the gravitational field in galaxies mimicks , for whatever reason , an effectively modified force law on galaxy scales , known as modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) .",
    "this formula however fails to account for dynamics and lensing of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , clowe et al .",
    "2006 , angus et al .",
    "2007 ) , meaning that if the formula would be reflecting a true modification of gravity as an alternative to galactic dark matter , it should rely at cluster scales on residual missing mass , which could be in baryonic or non - baryonic form ( milgrom 2008 , angus et al . 2007 ) , or the formula should be extended ( zhao & famaey 2012 ) .",
    "it is also unclear how the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) could be accounted for without resorting to some form of non - baryonic dark matter ( e.g. , slosar et al . 2005 , angus 2009 ) . nevertheless , the main motivation for studying alternatives to @xmath0cdm based on the mond phenomenology is _ not _ necessarily to get rid of any form of ` dark matter ' , but rather to explain why the observed gravitational field in galaxies is apparently mimicking a universal force law generated by the baryons alone .",
    "the simplest explanation is of course _ a priori _ not that dark matter particles arrange themselves ( by a hitherto unknown physical mechanism ) in order to mimick a fake force law , but rather that the force law itself is modified .",
    "however , at a fundamental level , covariant theories of modified gravity often have to include new fields in the dark sector to reproduce this effective force law ( fields with an energy density nevertheless subdominant to the baryonic one , and a role completely different from that of cdm : they would mediate the force rather than sourcing it ) , or even introduce what could be called a ` dark matter medium ' ( with an energy density outweighing the baryonic one ) exhibiting a kind of new fundamental interaction with baryons : this makes the confrontation between mond and dark matter much less clear than often believed , since the former implies a more complex structure of the dark sector than the currently assumed cdm , but does not necessarily imply the absence of a dark sector . in mond , the new fields responsible for the effects usually attributed to cdm would in fact be somewhat closer to dark energy fields than to cdm .",
    "it would of course be even more exciting if one would manage to find a physical connection between these putative new fields and the actual dark energy sector .",
    "we herefater list a ( non - exhaustive ) series of problems for @xmath0cdm ( sect .",
    "2 ) , then show how theories based on the mond phenomenology might address a lot of them ( sect .",
    "3 ) , before listing a ( non - exhaustive ) series of covariant theories currently proposed in this vein ( sect .  4 ) , together with their own questionmarks and internal problems .",
    "the reading of this short proceeding can be completed by the reading of the exhaustive review paper recently published in living reviews in relativity ( famaey & mcgaugh 2012 ) .",
    "* * the missing satellites challenge .",
    "* @xmath0cdm simulations predict vast numbers of subhaloes that are satellites to the main halo hosting a galaxy like the milky way .",
    "one would naively expect each of these subhaloes to host their own miniature satellite galaxy .",
    "the local group looks nothing like this prediction , having only a small handful of dwarfs around each of the giant galaxies .",
    "taking into account stellar feedback and heating processes ( mainly at re - ionisation ) in the galaxy formation process , the predicted number of faint satellites around a milky way - like galaxy is @xmath2  100 to 600 . since the majority of the 24 known satellites of the milky way have been largely discovered with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and since this survey covered only one fifth of the sky , it has been argued that the problem was solved .",
    "however , models that successfully explain the properties of the milky way dwarf satellites predict unobserved dwarfs beyond the virial radius ( bovill & ricotti 2011a ) .",
    "moreover , the models tend to produce an overabundance of bright dwarf satellites ( @xmath3 ) with respect to observations ( bovill & ricotti 2011b ) .",
    "a rather discomforting way - out is to simply state that the milky way must be a statistical outlier , but this is actually contradicted by the study of strigari & wechsler ( 2012 ) on the abundance of bright satellites around milky way - like galaxies in the sdss survey .",
    "a somewhat related but nevertheless distinct problem is that simulations predict that the most massive subhaloes of the milky way are too _ dense _ to host any of the observed bright satellite galaxies ( boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "this is the ` too big to fail ' aspect of the missing satellites challenge",
    ". a potential solution might be warm rather than cold dark matter .",
    "* * the satellites phase - space correlation challenge ( disks of satellites ) . * the distribution of dark subhalos around milky way - sized halos",
    "is also predicted by @xmath0cdm to be roughly isotropic .",
    "however , the milky way satellites are currently observed to be highly correlated in phase - space : they lie within a seemingly rotationally supported , relatively thin disk ( fig .",
    "1 , see kroupa et al .",
    "this differs from the prediction for subhalos in both coordinate and momentum space . since the sdss survey covered only one fifth of the sky , it will of course be most interesting to see whether ongoing surveys such as pan - starrs will confirm this state of affairs .",
    "whether or not such a satellite phase - space correlation would be unique to the milky way should also be carefully checked : the milky way could be a statistical outlier , but if the @xmath0cdm model is a realistic description of nature , then the average satellite configurations in external galaxies should be only moderately flattened , and generally non - rotating . in this respect , the recent findings of ibata et al .",
    "( 2013 ) that half of the satellites of m31 define an extremely thin and extended rotating structure makes this phase - space correlation challenge even more severe ( see sect .  3 for a possible solution ) . + spatial distribution of the milky way ( mw ) satellites ( from kroupa et al .",

    "* the angular momentum challenge . * both the merger history of galaxy disks in a hierarchical formation scenario and the associated transfer of angular momentum from the baryonic disk to the dark halo cause the specific angular momentum of the baryons to end up being much too small in simulated disks . these simulated disks in turn end up much smaller than the observed ones , and elliptical systems end up too concentrated too . to address this challenge within the standard paradigm , one needs to form disks through late - time quiescent gas accretion from large - scale filaments , with less late - time mergers than currently predicted in @xmath0cdm . *",
    "* the pure disk challenge .",
    "* related to the previous problem , large _",
    "thin disk galaxies are very difficult to produce in simulations .",
    "this is because major mergers typically create bulges .",
    "this is fundamental to the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in @xmath0cdm , wherein galaxies are built by the merger of smaller galaxies .",
    "bulgeless galaxies should therefore represent the rare , quiescent tail of a distribution of merger histories for galaxies of the local volume .",
    "however , these bulgeless disk galaxies are quite common , representing more than half of large galaxies ( with @xmath4 ) in the local volume . *",
    "* the stability challenge .",
    "* quasi - spherical cdm halos stabilize very low surface density disks against the formation of bars and spirals , due to a lack of disk self - gravity .",
    "the observation ( mcgaugh et al . 1995 ) of low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies with prominent bars and spirals is thus challenging in the absence of a significant disk component of dark matter .",
    "moreover , in the absence of such a disky dark matter component , the lack of disk self - gravity prevents the creation of observed large razor thin lsb disks .",
    "this suggests more disk self - gravity than meets the eye ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) .",
    "in the standard context , this would tend to point towards an additional disk - specific dm component , either a cdm - one linked to in - plane accretion of satellites , or a baryonic one , for instance in the form of molecular gas or due to a bottom - heavy imf .",
    "* * the bulk flow challenge .",
    "* in the @xmath0cdm model , peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters are predicted to be of order @xmath5  km / s .",
    "these velocities can actually be measured through the fluctuations in the cmb generated by the scattering of the cmb photons by the hot x - ray - emitting gas inside galaxy clusters .",
    "these observations yield an observed coherent bulk flow of order @xmath6  km / s on scales out to at least 400  mpc ( kashlinsky et al . 2012 )",
    ". this bulk flow challenge also appears in galaxy studies ( watkins et al .",
    "a related problem is the collision velocity of the merging bullet cluster 1e0657 - 56 at @xmath7 , which is larger than 3100  km / s , too high a value to be accounted for by @xmath0cdm .",
    "these observations seem to indicate that the attractive force is enhanced compared to what @xmath0cdm predicts . *",
    "* the high - z clusters challenge .",
    "* the observation of a single very massive cluster at high redshift can falsify @xmath0cdm . in this respect the existence of galaxy clusters like el gordo with a mass of @xmath8 at @xmath9 ( menanteau et al .",
    "2012 ) and xmmu  j2235.3 - 2557 with a mass of of @xmath10 at @xmath11 is surprising . though not sufficient to rule out the model , these clusters certainly push the envelope : there is only about a 50:50 chance that a cluster as massive as el gordo exists at such high redshift .",
    "this has been the empirical experience : for every generation of surveys , structures are found further away , and appear sooner than expected . *",
    "* the local void challenge . *",
    "the 562 known galaxies at distances smaller than 8  mpc from the center of the local group define the ` local volume ' . within this volume ,",
    "the region known as the ` local void ' hosts only 3 galaxies .",
    "this is much less than the expected @xmath12 galaxies for a typical similar void in the @xmath0cdm model ( peebles & nusser 2010 ) .",
    "moreover , in the local volume , large luminous galaxies are 6 times more abundant than predicted in the underdense regions .",
    "this could just mean that the local volume is a statistical outlier , but it could also point , in line with the two previous problems , towards more rapid structure formation in the early universe , allowing sparse regions to form large galaxies cleaning their environment in a shorter time , thus making the voids emptier and the galaxies larger at early times .      * * the cusp - core challenge . *",
    "a long - standing problem of @xmath0cdm is the fact that the numerical simulations of the collapse of dark matter halos lead to a ` cuspy ' density distribution that rises steeply as a decreasing function of radius , while rotation curves of external galaxies imply nearly constant density cores in the central parts .",
    "the state - of - the - art solution to this problem is to enforce strong supernovae outflows that move large amounts of low - angular - momentum gas from the central parts and that pull on the central dark matter concentration to create a core , but this is still a relatively fine - tuned process , which fails to account for cored profiles in the smallest galaxies , and fails to produce their observed baryon fractions * * the missing baryons challenge(s ) : baryon fraction defined by the acceleration in units of @xmath13 .",
    "* constraints from the cmb imply @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , our inventory of known baryons in the local universe comes up short of the total .",
    "for example , bell et al . ( 2003 ) estimate that the sum of cold gas and stars is only @xmath2  5% of @xmath16 .",
    "while it now seems that many of the missing baryons are in the form of highly ionized gas in the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , we are still unable to give a confident account of where all the baryons reside .",
    "but there is another missing baryons challenge within each cdm halo : one would indeed naively expect each halo to have the same baryon fraction as the universe , @xmath17 . on the scale of clusters of galaxies , this is approximately true ( but still systematically low ) , but for galaxies , observations depart from this in a systematic way which remains unexplained in the standard context . in fig .  2 ( mcgaugh et al . 2010 ) ,",
    "the ratio of the detected baryon fraction over the cosmological one , @xmath18 , is plotted as a function of the potential well of the systems .",
    "there is a clear correlation : at large radii , the baryon fraction is actually directly equivalent to the acceleration in units of @xmath19 .",
    "if we adopt a rough relation @xmath20 , we get that the acceleration at @xmath21 , and thus the baryon fraction , is @xmath22 .",
    "divided by the cosmological baryon fraction , this explains the trend for @xmath23 with potential ( @xmath24 ) in fig .",

    "this is surprising because these galactic collisions should be very effective at segregating dark and baryonic matter : the rotating gas disks of galaxies that provide the fodder for tidal tails and the tdgs that form within them initially have nearly circular , coplanar orbits .",
    "in contrast , the dark matter particles are on predominantly radial orbits in a quasi - spherical distribution .",
    "this difference in phase space leads to tidal tails that themselves contain very little dark matter .",

    "on the other hand , baryons dominate in the inner parts of hsb galaxies whose central surface density is higher than @xmath51 .",
    "there is an anti - correlation between the baryonic surface density and the fractional contribution of dm to the rotation curve ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "to explain this , there must be a strong fine - tuning between dark and baryonic surface densities , a sort of repulsion between them , a repulsion which is however contradicted by the correlations between baryonic and dark matter bumps and wiggles in rotation curves ( known as ` renzo s rule ' ) .",
    "the shapes of rotation curves also depend on surface density : hsb galaxies have rotation curves that rise steeply then become flat , or even fall somewhat to the not - yet - reached asymptotic flat velocity , while lsb galaxies have rotation curves that rise slowly to the asymptotic flat velocity .",

    "it would obviously be interesting if these observational occurences could be summarized and empirically unified in some way : such a unification _ is _ actually feasible through the rather old idea of milgrom ( 1983 ) that the total gravity @xmath58 is related to the baryon - generated one @xmath59 in a way analogous to coulomb s law in a dieletric medium : @xmath60 where the interpolating function @xmath61 this law is at the basis of the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) paradigm .",

    "this means that mond is promising in addressing the high - z clusters challenge and local void challenge , as well as the bulk flow challenge and high collisional velocity of the bullet cluster ( llinares et al .",

    "this could explain the observed abundance of large thin bulgeless disks unaffected by major mergers , and in those rare mergers between spirals , many tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) would be formed .",
    "this could lead to the possibility that many dwarf galaxies are not primordial but have been formed tidally in these encounters ( kroupa et al .",

    "what is more , the density - morphology relation for dwarf ellipticals could also find a natural explanation ( dabringhausen & kroupa 2012 ) .",

    "matter and twin matter would not interact at all in the high - acceleration regime , and would repel each other in the mond regime ( i.e. , when the acceleration difference of the two sectors is small compared to @xmath13 ) , thereby possibly playing a crucial role in the universe expansion and structure formation . + * main weaknesses * : ( i ) should still be checked against the existence of ghost modes , ( ii ) structure formation etc . to be studied in more details , ( iii ) not clear how these theories can explain the angular power spectrum of the cmb ( even when appealing to twin matter ) .      * main ingredients * : normal matter coupling to the gr physical metric @xmath82 , dark matter also coupling to the physical metric , but carrying a space - like four - vector gravitational dipole moment @xmath100 . + * action * : the dipolar dark matter medium ( blanchet 2007 , blanchet & le tiec 2009 ) is described as a fluid with mass current @xmath101 endowed with the dipole moment vector @xmath102 ( which will affect the total density in addition to the above mass density @xmath103 ) , with the following action : @xmath104 } , \\label{ddmact}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the norm of the projection perpendicular to the four - velocity of the polarization field @xmath106 . the poisson equation in the weak - field limit is then recovered as : @xmath107 from there , in order to reproduce the mond phenomenology in galaxies , one appeals to a ` weak - clustering hypothesis ' , namely the fact that , in galaxies , the dark matter fluid does not cluster much ( @xmath108 ) and is essentially at rest ( @xmath109 ) because the internal force of the fluid precisely balances the gravitational force , in such a way that the polarization field @xmath110 is precisely aligned with the gravitational one @xmath58 , and @xmath111 . at the cosmological level , the monopolar density of the dipolar atoms @xmath103 will play the role of cdm , while the minimum of the potential @xmath112 naturally adds a cosmological constant term @xmath99 , thus explaining this numerical coincidence and making the theory precisely equivalent to the @xmath0cdm model at linear order for the expansion , for large scale structure formation , and for the cmb ( naturally explaining the high third peak ) . + * main weaknesses * : ( i ) not clear that the weak - clustering hypothesis in galaxies would be the only natural outcome of structure formation within this model , ( ii ) the weak clustering hypothesis in itself might be problematic for explaining the residual missing mass in galaxy clusters , due to the fact that this residual mass should essentially be concentrated in the central parts of these objects , thus leaving the model to rely on baryonic dark matter or additional hot dark matter to explain galaxy clusters .",
    "if one is familiar with cosmology and large scale structure , it must seem rather peculiar that anyone would seriously consider alternatives to @xmath0cdm based on the mond phenomenology .",
    "but if one is more concerned with the observed phenomenology in a wide range of galaxy data , it seems just as odd to invoke non - baryonic and collisionless cdm together with fine - tuned feedback to explain the appearance of an effective force law that appears to act with only the observed baryons as a source in galaxies ( see sect  2.4 and 3 , see also famaey & mcgaugh 2012 for an extensive review )",
    ". accepting this , and building a theory to account for this phenomenology , could perhaps help resolving ( see sect .",
    "3 ) many of the other challenges ( sects .",
    "2.12.3 ) currently faced by @xmath0cdm .",
    "nevertheless , consistent covariant theories that have currently been proposed along these lines are at best effective , and bring with them their own challenges ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "indeed , the most important aspect before one rejects any model is to have a ` simpler ' model at hand , that still reproduces the successes of the earlier favored model but also naturally predicts the discrepant data .",
    "while mond , as a paradigm , has _ a priori _ predicted a lot of observations which @xmath0cdm can not explain in galaxies , it is absolutely fair to say that there is currently no alternative which does better _ overall _ than @xmath0cdm , and in favor of which ockham s razor would be .",
    "it would however probably be a great mistake to persistently ignore the fine - tuning problems for @xmath0cdm and the related uncanny successes of the mond paradigm on galaxy scales , as they could very plausibly point at a hypothetical better new theory of the dark sector .",
    "it would for instance be extremely exciting if one would manage to find a physical connection between the dark energy sector and the galactic mond phenomenology in the weak - field limit through the @xmath99 coincidence . in this sense , ideas based on entropic gravity are an interesting line of thought ( verlinde 2011 , ho et al .",
    "2010 , klinkhamer & kopp 2011 , and others , all somewhat inspired by milgrom 1999 ) , but one should nevertheless keep in mind the observational challenges that any such new theory of the dark sector could face , especially regarding the third peak of the acoustic power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "it is , on the other hand , conceivable that a fully successful alternative theory does not exist , and that the apparent mondian behavior of galaxies will be explained through small compensatory adjustments of the current @xmath0cdm paradigm .",
    "but one has to realize that this is far from trivial , and one would have to demonstrate how this could possibly occur .",
    "one also has to realize that most currently proposed mond - inspired effective theories ( see sect .",
    "4 ) do include new fields , so that the mond paradigm does not necessarily imply the absence of a dark sector . in any case , the existence of a characteristic acceleration @xmath113 playing various roles in many apparently independent galactic scaling relations is by now an empirically established fact , and it is thus mandatory for _ any _ successful model of galaxy formation and evolution to explain it , together with all the other challenges mentioned in sect .  2 .",
