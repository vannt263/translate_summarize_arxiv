    "there is a growing interest in trying to identify the mechanisms driving galaxy evolution in different kinds of environments , from cluster cores to their outskirts and beyond , i.e. in what is commonly called the  field \" @xcite .",
    "dynamical analysis and _ n_-body simulations @xcite predict that galaxies closer than a few half - light radii , whether in a group or a rich cluster of galaxies , are likely to merge within short timescales .",
    "simulations also predict a merger remnant to display a @xmath5 profile : ngc 1132 , an isolated elliptical with extended x  ray diffuse emission @xcite , could actually represent the prototypical example of the final evolution of all small  scale dense systems @xcite .",
    "several arguments indicate however that the chemical , dynamical and photometrical parameters of massive ellipticals are not compatible with their formation being the result of several major merging events diluted along the hubble time @xcite . on the observational side ,",
    "there is surely good evidence of mergers at low redshift , but spectacular systems such as the centaurus group do not seem to be all that common @xcite , though they are repeatedly cited . and the characteristics of galaxies which are observed in the act of merging such as ulirg systems indicate that the final product of the merging event does not resemble a massive galaxy @xcite .",
    "cluster cores certainly strongly modify the evolution of a galaxy , but only few galaxies ( @xmath6 5%-10% ) are cluster members .",
    "similarly , it has been found that star formation is statistically enhanced in close pairs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , but again these specific environments do not host a large fraction of the galaxy population .",
    "most galaxies are found in groups , which are either quite isolated or in chains or infalling into clusters .",
    "it is therefore important to understand whether close , low - velocity encounters in groups are relevant mechanisms for galaxy modification , and whether these environments are sites of the evolution ( now or in the past ) for a relevant number of galaxies @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations have greatly helped in defining the properties and the physical reality of poor / loose groups of galaxies and compact groups with a dominant elliptical @xcite .",
    "loose groups in particular are otherwise rather `` ill defined '' structures if one remains in the optical realm of observations .",
    "one of the more interesting results of recent years is the detection and characterization of extended x - ray emission ( an almost defining characteristic of galaxy clusters ) in groups with few accredited members .",
    "even galaxy pairs @xcite are found to be associated to diffuse x  ray emission , suggesting that systems with different morphological characteristics and degree of compactness represent different classes among small  scale systems of galaxies ( sssgs hereafter ) .    in order to contribute to the understanding of their evolution we started a study of sssgs ( in paper  i ) , defined in 3d redshift space .",
    "the present paper collects optical photometric and spectro  photometric data for a sample of candidate members of the sssg dominated by the elliptical ngc  4756 .",
    "the goals of the present paper are the following : 1 ) to obtain a redshift estimate which will provide an independent check of the systemic velocities of the dominant ngc  4756 group members and to detect possible faint members 2 ) to investigate the structure of member galaxies through a detailed surface photometry and 3 ) to analyze any possible induced activity using medium resolution spectroscopy and diagnostic models .",
    "the study aims also to contribute to the detection and photometric characterization of the faint galaxie population within the group area whose membership will be determined by ongoing redshift surveys .    the paper is organized as follows : the literature about the ngc  4756 group is presented in   2 . a description of the photometric and spectroscopic observations , data reduction and analysis is given in   3 .",
    "results about photometric and spectroscopic properties of individual bright objects , scaling relation of the candidate early - type , from bright to dwarf , galaxy population as well as the characteristics of the x  ray emission in the area are presented in   4 .",
    "before redshift surveys , ngc  4756 and its companions have been associated to abell  1631 , a bautz  morgan type i cluster , within which the morphological work of @xcite includes 139 galaxies .",
    "later , @xcite compiled a catalog of radial velocities and detected that a foreground group , well centred on the cluster , is responsible for many of the apparently bright cluster members .",
    "they observed that the group is much poorer than the main cluster at cz @xmath1 15000 km  s@xmath3 .",

    "x  ray emission from ngc  4756 was first observed with the _ einstein observatory _ by @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out at the eso 3.6 m telescope equipped with the multi  purpose instrument efosc2 in the period may 5  7 , 2000 .",

    "most of the remaining galaxies visible in figure  [ figure1 ] have a known redshift and belong to the background cluster .    in order to extend the mapping of galaxies in the ngc  4756 area we analyzed a photometrically calibrated v - band image obtained with the wide field imager ( wfi ) at the 2.2 m eso / mpi ( total fov@xmath134 @xmath0 34 arcmin ) .",
    "the data have been originally obtained from the wings group @xcite for the study of the background cluster of galaxies abell  1631 .",
    "the image is a co - adding of three non dithered frames of 460 seconds each and has a seeing of 0.7 .",

    "in the case of long  slit spectra , the slit has been oriented along the line connecting the nuclei of two sssg members in order to optimize exposure times .",
    "the spectra were calibrated with the iraf software package using standard procedures for bias subtraction and flat field correction .",
    "artifacts produced by cosmic ray events were removed by applying a filtering algorithm .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed on the frames by fitting a third order polynomial using as reference the helium  argon spectrum taken before each object spectrum .",
    "the typical error was in the range between 0.5 to 1   .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated with the iraf package kpnoslit .",
    "this procedure included the airmass and extinction corrections using standard stars and the atmospheric extinction coefficients published for eso la silla .",
    "heliocentric systemic velocities have been obtained through a cross  correlation technique using the iraf task crosscor or through the fitting of emission or absorption lines with a single gaussian , when the cross  correlation yielded no results because of low signal  to  noise absorption line data .",
    "salient results from the spectroscopic study are given in table  [ tab3 ] and table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "the b and r image cleaning , dark and bias subtraction , flat  fielding , cosmic ray removal and the final calibration and image manipulation were performed using the iraf and eso  midas software packages . due to the large spatial extent of the group",
    "it was necessary to make a mosaic of several images .",
    "the mosaic image of the group , shown in figure  [ figure1 ] , was assembled using as a reference 7 to 10 field stars common in the different images .",
    "the accuracy of the image alignment was usually better than 1 pixel .",
    "images of photometric standard stars were obtained with the same instrumental set  up .",
    "each of these fields contains several calibration stars , avoiding the crowding problem typical of fields surrounding globular cluster areas .",
    "we used the standard photometric transformation equations tailored to the eso ( la silla ) system of extinction coefficients .",
    "ellipses were fitted by weighted least squares to the isophotes of the ngc  4756 group member galaxies using the iraf isophote package @xcite within stsdas .",
    "surface brightness , position angle and ellipticity profiles together with the fourier ",
    "coefficients , to quantify the deviations of the isophotes from pure ellipses , were derived . for the early  type members ,",

    "the same procedure as described in paper  i was adopted to analyze the surface brightness distribution in spiral galaxies .",
    "the luminosity and geometric profiles of bright galaxies in the group are presented in figure  [ figure2 ] , figure  [ figure3 ] and figure  [ figure4 ] .",
    "salient data obtained from the surface photometric study are collected in table  [ tab5 ] .",
    "results of the analysis of the fine structure are presented in figures  [ figure5 ] and [ figure6 ] .",
    "the good quality seeing of the complementary v - band wide field image allowed us to detect and study the galaxy population in the field of ngc  4576 down to faint levels .",
    "source extraction was performed using the sextractor software @xcite , which uses a routine based on neural network generated weights for star - galaxy separation .",
    "detections were checked visually and objects with the _ stellaricity _ parameter greater than 0.5 were deemed to be definitely stellar and therefore discarded .",
    "all objects with a major axis @xmath202  and with a magnitude outside the range @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) were not processed further since they are most likely background objects .",
    "furtheron , all known galaxy members of the abell  1631 cluster were removed from the list .",
    "applying these selection criteria we identify 115 galaxies as group member candidates in addition to the objects studied with the 3.6 m",
    ".    for candidate objects where neither redshift information is available nor an unambiguous association to the ngc 4756 group is possible , we provide their identification and the measure of their accurate astrometric position useful for redshift followup .",
    "the wings project is indeed performing a spectroscopic study of a set of nearby clusters up to their outskirts , including the abell 1631 field , and will determine therefore the group membership . notice that @xcite studied the galaxy population in a small number of groups .",
    "they found a significantly higher number of faint galaxies ( 20 - 50 members down to magnitudes as faint as m@xmath23 -14 + 5log@xmath24 h@xmath25 ) in x - ray detected groups , most of which are early - types , than in groups without hot igm .",
    "we consequently expect to find a significant population of dwarf galaxies also in the ngc  4756 group ( see x - ray properties in ",
    "we further determine the accurate photometric properties of the candidate galaxies .",
    "several studies in the literature start to analyze the photometric properties of the faint galaxy population within groups ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) which could be among the driver of the group evolution .",
    "we used also galfit v.2 @xcite to obtain an accurate modeling of the surface photometry of each galaxy which gives us the parameters necessary to study galaxy scaling relations .",
    "in particular we obtained the central surface brightness , @xmath26 , the half - light radius , r@xmath27 , the surface brightness at the effective radius , @xmath28 , and the sersic profile shape parameter , @xmath29 for the bulge component of the galaxies .",
    "the analysis yielded that brighter objects exhibit typical values of @xmath29 in the range of @xmath30 while the faint galaxies part of which possibly belong to the ngc  4756 group have values @xmath31 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath29 on the absolute magnitude of early - type galaxies has been pointed out in several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our findings are also in agreement with results of similar studies e.g. such as that of @xcite .",
    "the coordinates of the bright group members ( m@xmath32 mag ) and the dwarf galaxy candidates are given in tables  [ tab6 ] and [ tab7 ] respectively together with the results of the surface photometry .",
    "it has to be emphasized however , that the method of using the sersic profile shape parameter to identify dwarf galaxies possibly belonging to the group is prone to rather large uncertainties .",
    "it has to be expected therefore that a certain fraction of the objects listed in table  [ tab7 ] are galaxies belonging to the background cluster .",
    "a spectroscopic follow - up will give a definite answer .",
    "the relevant data about the confirmed bright members of the ngc  4756 group are summarized in tables [ tab3 ] , [ tab4 ] and [ tab5 ] , including three new members we found to belong to the ngc  4756 group .",

    "ngc  4756 is associated with an x  ray source @xcite , however the presence of the background cluster abell  1631 makes it difficult to disentangle the contribution of the galaxy from that of the cluster .    the area of the ngc 4756 group has been observed by the rosat hri and by asca .",
    "given the complexity of the field , however neither instrument is ideally suited for the study , because of their limited sensitivities and for their characteristics : asca has a rather poor spatial response , while the hri , with a much better spatial resolution , lacks the energy response that asca can provide .",
    "nevertheless , the relevant data were retrieved from the archives .",
    "for the hri , the three available observations were merged .",
    "for asca only the gis3 data were considered .",
    "two images representing the softer and harder energy bands were produced from the _ screened event _ files .",
    "an adaptive smoothing algorithm software , see http://asc.harvard.edu ] was then applied to the data .",
    "the hri data confirm the presence of emission localized on the galaxies ( ngc 4756 itself , mcg  23338 , that hosts a seyfert nucleus and is located in the southern sub  group , and a bright elliptical to the se edge of the background cluster ) but also suggests that the large scale structure evident mostly to the n of ngc 4756 in the _ einstein _ data might extend also to the s ( figure  [ figure10]-top ) .",
    "the lower angular resolution asca data are used to obtain images in different energy bands .",
    "the comparison between the softer and harder energy ones suggests that there are two seperate extended components with slightly different spatial distributions ( figure  [ figure10]-bottom ) : the softer band emission is generally peaked on ngc  4756 , while in the harder band the centroid moves to the north , roughly at the position of a few galaxies in abell  1631 .",
    "the emission appears to extend to the southern sub - group , however the seyfert galaxy is likely to contribute a large fraction of the emission observed from that region , masking the possible contribution from hot gas local to the sub - group .",
    "in an hierarchical evolutionary scenario , the group characteristics of the diffuse x - ray emission suggest an evolutionary link between all small - scale systems of galaxies in low density environments , from groups to field objects . however , the link between loose groups and isolated ellipticals is far from being demonstrated , albeit the additional support from morphological evidence of an excess of fine structures in isolated ellipticals @xcite .",
    "we present a study of the ngc  4756 loose group , probably one of the most difficult ( observationally ) but intriguing cases in the above framework since it has in principle all the characteristics of an `` evolving loose group '' .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that ngc  4756 and its companions are projected onto the abell  1631 cluster , although in redshift space the separation is clear between the @xmath45 15000 km  s@xmath3 cluster and the @xmath46 4000 km  s@xmath3 galaxy / group @xcite .",
    "our detailed study , photometric and spectroscopic , concentrates on the central part of the group ( a strip of diameter @xmath1 300 kpc , h@xmath2 = 70 km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 ) which has a very loose configuration ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we extend our photometric study to the faint galaxy population in the area in the attempt to detect and characterize the group dwarf galaxy population .",
    "we are aware that there is a contamination of the background cluster but the group / cluster membership will be refined by ongoing redshift studies .",
    "recent works in the literature @xcite suggest indeed the presence of a consistent population of faint / dwarf galaxies in x  ray bright groups which are considered a small  scale version of clusters of galaxies .",
    "these fainter objects should mark the potential well of the group and in a hierarchical evolutionary scenario being among the driver of the galaxy evolution , through successive accretion phenomena , which could trigger agn such as that occurring in mcg  23338 and through star formation activity re - juvenate galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our work suggests that the group has at least a population of 22 galaxies within a velocity range of 1500 km  s@xmath3 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the median of the central elliptical , ngc 4756 . at about 7.5  arcmin sw of ngc  4756 a sub  structure well separated from ngc 4756",
    "is detected , that includes ic  829 , mcg  23335 , mcg  23336 and mcg  23338 , which meets the hickson criteria for being a compact group .",
    "_ it is noteworthy that most of the galaxies in our sample showing interaction signatures are concentrated in this sub - structure_. the group then falls within the category of loose groups which could be the birthplace of compact groups @xcite . at the same time , the fact that the brightest elliptical ( ngc  4756 ) is unperturbed and quite isolated with respect to the compact group suggests a separate history of these two parts of the system .",
    "recently @xcite analyzed a set of 8 extremely isolated e / s0 galaxies .",
    "they suggest that at least four of their objects are probable fossil groups .",
    "the colors of two of them are quite blue - ( b - r)@xmath201 - and one of them kig  870 posseses a possible double nucleus .",
    "none of our early - type galaxies have color and structure characteristics similar to these objects .",
    "ngc  4756 , with its normal color and regular structure , suggests either an unperturbed history within a pristine loose group or a very old and `` digested '' merging event . indeed , most of the isolated objects of @xcite are more similar in structure and color to ngc  4756 .    at the present time",
    "only inadequate x - ray data are available and consequently can not allow a proper and conclusive analysis of the x  ray properties of the ngc  4756 group .",
    "the available x  ray data would however point to the presence of two distinct systems at different temperatures , corresponding to the foreground group ( softer ) and the background cluster ( harder ) .",
    "none of the poor groups observed in x - rays , like those catalogued by mulchaey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) has optical characteristics like those of the ngc  4756 group , since they are mainly either loose configurations or compact groups from the hickson catalogue or alike .",
    "our data could depict the ngc  4756 group as an `` evolving group '' , consistent with models of @xcite who proposed that compact configurations are continually replaced after a merging episode has taken place and produced elliptical - like members .",
    "alternatively , the lack of bright galaxies , in particular ellipticals , could indicate a fundamentally different type of group compared to those having a luminous elliptical among its members .    combining x - ray observations with currently operating satellites with deep optical spectroscopy of",
    "candidates dwarfs galaxies identified in this paper , aimed at establishing their group membership , may prove to be of crucial importance to study the potential field associated to the system , for a more complete understanding of the properties of the ngc  4756 group of galaxies .",

    "<S> the characteristics of the group are investigated through ( a ) the detailed investigation of the morphological , photometric and spectroscopic properties of nine galaxies among the dominant members of the group ( b ) the determination of the photometric parameters of the faint galaxy population in an area of 34@xmath0 34  centered on ngc  4756 and ( c ) an analysis of the x - ray emission in the area based upon archival data .    </S>",
    "<S> the nine member galaxies are located in the core part of the ngc  4756 group ( a strip diameter @xmath1 300 kpc in diameter , h@xmath2 = 70 km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 ) which has a very loose configuration . the central part of the ngc  4756 group contains a significant fraction of early  type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> three new group members with previously unknown systemic velocities are identified , one of which is a de . at about 7.5  sw of ngc  4756 a sub  structure of the group is detected , including ic  829 , mcg  23335 , mcg  23336 and mcg  23338 , which meets the hickson criteria for being a compact group . </S>",
    "<S> most of the galaxies in this sub - structure show interaction signatures . </S>",

    "<S> this galaxy displays however signatures of nuclear activity . </S>",
    "<S> strong [ o  iii ] , [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] line emission , combined with comparatively weak , but broad h@xmath4 emission suggest an intermediate seyfert type classification .    although the area is heavily contaminated by the background cluster abell  1631 , x  ray data suggest the presence of a hot intergalactic medium related to the group to the x  ray emission detected . </S>",
