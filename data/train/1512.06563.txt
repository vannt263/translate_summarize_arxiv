    "exponential random graphs represent an important and challenging class of models , displaying both diverse and novel phase transition phenomena .",
    "these rather general models are exponential families of probability distributions over graphs , in which dependence between the random edges is defined through certain finite subgraphs , in imitation of the use of potential energy to provide dependence between particle states in a grand canonical ensemble of statistical physics .",
    "they are particularly useful when one wants to construct models that resemble observed networks as closely as possible , but without specifying an explicit network formation mechanism .",
    "consider the set @xmath0 of all simple graphs @xmath1 on @xmath2 vertices ( `` simple '' means undirected , with no loops or multiple edges ) . by a @xmath3-parameter family of exponential random graphs",
    "we mean a family of probability measures @xmath4 on @xmath5 defined by , for @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 are @xmath3 real parameters , @xmath9 are pre - chosen finite simple graphs ( and we take @xmath10 to be a single edge ) , @xmath11 is the density of graph homomorphisms ( the probability that a random vertex map @xmath12 is edge - preserving ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the normalization constant , @xmath15 intuitively , we can think of the @xmath3 parameters @xmath16 as tuning parameters that allow one to adjust the influence of different subgraphs @xmath17 of @xmath1 on the probability distribution and analyze the extent to which specific values of these subgraph densities `` interfere '' with one another .",
    "since the real - world networks the exponential models depict are often very large in size , our main interest lies in exploring the structure of a typical graph drawn from the model when @xmath2 is large .",
    "this subject has attracted enormous attention in mathematics , as well as in various applied disciplines .",
    "many of the investigations employ the elegant theory of graph limits as developed by lovsz and coauthors ( v.t .",
    "ss , b. szegedy , c. borgs , j. chayes , k. vesztergombi ,  ) @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . building on earlier work of aldous @xcite and hoover @xcite ,",
    "the graph limit theory creates a new set of tools for representing and studying the asymptotic behavior of graphs by connecting sequences of graphs to a unified graphon space equipped with a cut metric .",
    "though the theory itself is tailored to dense graphs , serious attempts have been made at formulating parallel results for sparse graphs @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . applying the graph limit theory to @xmath3-parameter exponential random graphs and",
    "utilizing a large deviations result for erds - rnyi graphs established in chatterjee and varadhan @xcite , chatterjee and diaconis @xcite showed that when @xmath2 is large and @xmath18 are non - negative , a typical graph drawn from the `` attractive '' exponential model ( [ pmf ] ) looks like an erds - rnyi graph @xmath19 in the graphon sense , where the edge presence probability @xmath20 is picked randomly from the set of maximizers of a variational problem for the limiting normalization constant @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of edges in @xmath24 .",
    "they also noted that in the edge-(multiple)-star model where @xmath25 is a @xmath26-star for @xmath27 , due to the unique structure of stars , maximizers of the variational problem for @xmath28 for all parameter values satisfy ( [ max ] ) and a typical graph drawn from the model is always erds - rnyi . since the limiting normalization constant is the generating function for the limiting expectations of other random variables on the graph space such as expectations and correlations of homomorphism densities , these crucial observations connect the occurrence of an asymptotic phase transition in ( [ pmf ] ) with an abrupt change in the solution of ( [ max ] ) and",
    "have led to further exploration into exponential random graph models and their variations .",
    "being exponential families with finite support , one might expect exponential random graph models to enjoy a rather basic asymptotic form , though in fact , virtually all these models are highly nonstandard as the size of the network increases .",
    "the @xmath29-parameter exponential random graph models have therefore generated continued research interest .",
    "these prototype models are simpler than their @xmath3-parameter extensions but nevertheless exhibit a wealth of non - trivial attributes and capture a variety of interesting features displayed by large networks .",
    "the relative simplicity furthermore helps us better understand how phases transition between one another as tuning parameters vary and provides insight into the expressive power of the exponential construction . in the statistical physics literature , phase transition",
    "is often associated with loss of analyticity in the normalization constant , which gives rise to discontinuities in the observed statistics . for exponential random graph models ,",
    "phase transition is characterized as a sharp , unambiguous partition of parameter ranges separating those values in which changes in parameters lead to smooth changes in the homomorphism densities , from those special parameter values where the response in the densities is singular .    for the `` attractive '' @xmath29-parameter edge - triangle model obtained by taking @xmath30 ( an edge ) , @xmath31 ( a triangle ) , and @xmath32 , chatterjee and diaconis @xcite gave the first rigorous proof of asymptotic singular behavior and identified a curve @xmath33 across which the model transitions from very sparse to very dense , completely skipping all intermediate structures .",
    "in further works ( see for example , radin and yin @xcite , aristoff and zhu @xcite ) , this singular behavior was discovered universally in generic @xmath29-parameter models where @xmath10 is an edge and @xmath34 is any finite simple graph , and the transition curve @xmath33 asymptotically approaches the straight line @xmath35 as the parameters diverge .",
    "the double asymptotic framework of @xcite was later extended in @xcite , and the scenario in which the parameters diverge along general straight lines @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a constant and @xmath38 , was considered .",
    "consistent with the near degeneracy predictions in @xcite @xcite @xcite , asymptotically for @xmath39 , a typical graph sampled from the `` attractive '' @xmath29-parameter exponential model is sparse , while for @xmath40 , a typical graph is nearly complete .",
    "although much effort has been focused on @xmath29-parameter models , @xmath3-parameter models have also been examined . as shown in @xcite , near degeneracy and universality",
    "are expected not only in generic @xmath29-parameter models but also in generic @xmath3-parameter models .",
    "asymptotically , a typical graph drawn from the `` attractive '' @xmath3-parameter exponential model where @xmath41 is sparse below the hyperplane @xmath42 and nearly complete above it . for the edge-(multiple)-star model",
    ", the desirable star feature relates to network expansiveness and has made predictions of similar asymptotic phenomena possible in broader parameter regions .",
    "related results may be found in hggstrm and jonasson @xcite , park and newman @xcite , bianconi @xcite , lubetzky and zhao @xcite , radin and sadun @xcite @xcite , and kenyon et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these theoretical findings have advanced our understanding of phase transitions in exponential random graph models , yet some important questions remain unanswered .",
    "previous investigations identified near degenerate parameter regions in which a typical sampled graph looks like an erds - rnyi graph @xmath19 , where the edge presence probability @xmath43 or @xmath44 , but the speed of @xmath45 towards these two degenerate states is not at all clear .",

    "how dense is it",
    "? can we give an explicit characterization of the near degenerate graph structure as a function of the parameters ?",
    "the rest of this paper is dedicated towards these goals .",
    "some of the ideas for the sparse case were partially implemented in @xcite .",
    "theorem [ 2generic ] considers generic `` attractive '' @xmath29-parameter exponential random graph models and theorem [ singlestar ] derives parallel results for `` repulsive '' edge-(single)-star models .",
    "the asymptotic characterization of @xmath45 obtained in these theorems then make possible a deeper exploration into the asymptotics of the limiting normalization constant of the exponential model in theorem [ norm ] , which indicates that though a typical graph displays erds - rnyi feature , the simplified erds - rnyi graph and the real exponential graph are not exact asymptotic analogs in the usual statistical physics sense . in the sparse region ,",
    "the erds - rnyi graph does seem to reflect the asymptotic tendency of the exponential graph more accurately , as the two interpretations of the limiting normalization constant coincide when the parameters diverge .",
    "lastly , theorems [ generic ] and [ inf ] further extend the near degenerate analysis from @xmath29-parameter exponential random graph models to @xmath3-parameter exponential random graph models .",
