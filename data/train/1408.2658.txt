    "furthermore , the section of the beam splitter potential that underlies the probability density simulation in fig .  [ fig : splitterdesignopti](c ) is scaled longitudinally to a length @xmath127 mm .",
    "the scaling of the beam splitter potential results in a splitting angle @xmath128mrad and a smaller beam separation of @xmath129 at the end of the beam splitter chip as compared to a separation of @xmath130 mm in the experiments described in the main text .",

    "<S> we release electron trajectories from a disk with a diameter of @xmath31 and propagate them numerically in the simulated electric field of the beam splitter chip . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : splitterexp](b ) shows the resulting simulated electron signal , which is in excellent agreement with the experimentally observed output signal . </S>",
    "<S> the color scale illustrates the initial lateral displacement of the electrons along the _ x_-axis . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , electrons released closest to the symmetry axis of the beam splitter potential [ blue dots in fig .  [ fig : splitterexp](b ) ] are preferentially lost . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by considering the extreme case of an electron being released at @xmath40 mm . </S>",
    "<S> because of the planar symmetry of the beam splitter potential in the @xmath18-direction , such a classical trajectory does not encounter any transverse potential gradient and therefore no deflecting force along @xmath18 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , this trajectory can not follow the pseudopotential minimum paths of the separating double well and is only deflected vertically away from the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , electrons that propagate closest to the symmetry axis may preferentially become lost from the beam splitter potential . using quantum mechanical simulations we show in the supplemental material that _ lossless _ , adiabatic splitting of an electron beam can be achieved by means of an optimized beam splitter potential .    </S>",
    "<S> further , we have varied the electron kinetic energy from @xmath33ev to @xmath1ev . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the signal of lost electrons becomes larger with energy as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : splitterexp](c ) as compared to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : splitterexp](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because with increasing forward momentum of the electrons the transverse gradient of the beam splitter potential becomes insufficient to significantly deflect the electrons in the lateral _ x_-direction . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the electron trajectories can not follow the separating paths of the potential minimum and are lost from the potential . as a consequence , for energies above @xmath41ev we observe no splitting anymore and </S>",
    "<S> all electrons are detected around @xmath40 mm in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : splitterexp](d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the beam diameter of @xmath31 , attained with the thermionic electron gun , is not matched to the diameter of the quantum mechanical ground state wavefunction ( on the order of @xmath42 nm ) of the transverse beam splitter potential . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that the guided electrons fill up the potential up to energies of @xmath43mev in the current experiment , which is orders of magnitude larger than the quantum ground state energy on the order of @xmath44ev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the experiment is well described by classical particle tracking simulations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the direct injection of electrons into low - lying motional quantum states should be possible by matching the incoming electron beam to the ground state wavefunction of the transverse guiding potential  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , the wave - optical propagation of a guided electron is governed by discretized motional quantum states of the transverse guiding potential . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the properties of the microwave beam splitter quantum mechanically and discuss prospects for electron - based quantum optics experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to compare the microwave beam splitter for electrons to a typical _ amplitude _ beam splitter as used in light optics . as detailed above , the beam splitter potential based on a hexapole intersection features two incoming and two outgoing channels . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we consider a planar symmetry of the beam splitter potential around the intersection point along @xmath14 , as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mwbs](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we label an incoming electron that occupies the motional ground state of the left ( right ) arm of the beam splitter with the state @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) . to understand the evolution of these localized input states one needs to consider the transverse energy eigenstates @xmath47 and @xmath48 at different points along the length of the beam splitter </S>",
    "<S> [ see the insets of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mwbs](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> while the paths are spatially well separated by a potential barrier these are the symmetric and antisymmetric ground states of a double - well potential , and their energy is ( almost ) degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> the localized input states are a superposition @xmath49 and @xmath50 of these eigenstates .        as @xmath45 and @xmath46 are not energy eigenstates , electrons will in principle tunnel between these two states </S>",
    "<S> . however , as long as the potential barrier is much larger than the transverse energy of these states , both wells are separated and the tunneling frequency is negligibly low . from a quantum mechanical point of view , the function of the beam splitter is to increase this frequency by bringing the two wells closer together and eventually merging them . in the center part of the splitter , </S>",
    "<S> the superposition states @xmath45 and @xmath46 are then no longer spatially separated and , hence , wave amplitude is transferred between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in general an incoming state with amplitudes @xmath51 in the left and @xmath52 in the right path is turned to an outgoing state with amplitudes @xmath53 and @xmath54 . if we describe the left path by the state @xmath55 and the right path by the state @xmath56 , the effect of the beam splitter @xmath57 can be described as a multiplication of the state with a unitary matrix : @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> if we disregard phase shifts , @xmath57 is essentially a rotation matrix whose angle depends on the oscillation frequency @xmath59 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the time the electron spends in the center part of the splitter .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous discussion assumes that the electron initially occupies the motional ground state of the transverse guiding potential . </S>",
    "<S> as described above , this can be achieved using a diffraction - limited electron gun in order to match the injected electron beam to the ground state wavefunction of the guiding potential . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a multi - mode interferometer using higher vibrational states has been investigated in the context of guided atom interferometry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the above description requires that an electron initially prepared in the quantum ground state maintains its state while propagating along the beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> the current design lacks this crucial feature of adiabaticity . </S>",
    "<S> using quantum mechanical simulations we have investigated the key prerequisites to achieve adiabatic splitting of the ground state mode . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the simulations are described in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of transverse vibrational excitations depends critically on the geometric opening angle between the beam splitter paths as well as the energy separation of the transverse eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> as one would expect , a smooth splitting process and , hence , a small opening angle is beneficial . by scaling the guiding potential transversely , we find that the half opening angle of the current design has to be reduced from 40mrad to @xmath60mrad . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have to increase the microwave drive frequency to @xmath61ghz to obtain beam splitting with @xmath62 of the population remaining in the ground state mode after the splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the eightfold higher @xmath3 effectively increases the curvature of the transverse potential and results in an @xmath63-fold larger energy level separation of the single - well potential of @xmath64ev and , hence , an oscillation frequency @xmath65mhz . </S>",
    "<S> both , the small beam splitter angle and the higher @xmath3 require a re - design of the current microwave chip </S>",
    "<S> .    as just introduced , beam splitters used in quantum optics experiments [ like in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mwbs](b ) ] are usually described by unitary matrices , which reflect the coupling between the amplitudes of two states  @xcite . the microwave beam splitter demonstrated here is a promising new technology because it may become such an _ amplitude _ beam splitter for electrons . </S>",
    "<S> most current experiments on electron interference rely on the electrostatic biprism , which is a _ wavefront _ beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefront beam splitter can be regarded as an electron optical device that generates two virtual sources by a spatial division of the beam . in that case , </S>",
    "<S> interference between both output beams relies on the spatial coherence of the electron source  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , using an amplitude splitter the phase between both output beams and their amplitudes are fully determined by the physical properties of the beam splitter device . to this end , the manipulation of electrons using the microwave beam splitter augments the already available , rich electron optical toolkit and may herald new quantum optics experiments with free electrons . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a novel quantum electron microscopy concept is emerging that employs multiple _ amplitude _ splittings of a quantum particle s wavefunction for the noninvasive imaging of biological samples  @xcite .    </S>",
