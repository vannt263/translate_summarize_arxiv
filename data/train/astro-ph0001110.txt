    "the thin hot plasma model gave an unsatisfactory fit to the nfi data .",
    "also , the fact that no difference was seen in equivalent width between the low- and high - flux intervals of the nfi data seems to be at odds with a thin thermal plasma origin of the emission line .",
    "therefore , we believe it is more probable that we are dealing with fluorescent emission in a photo - ionized medium .",
    "the ionization degree of the medium is fairly high , the ionization parameter @xmath45 ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) , where @xmath46 is the size of the fluorescent material and @xmath47 the atom density , is of order 10@xmath48 to 10@xmath49 which implies that the medium must be close to the source of the continuum radiation .",

    "this too is not unreasonable , increased levels of mass loss are likely to go hand in hand with such brightening . finally , there is the observation that the largest flare forced the system to go in quiescence .",

    "the giant outburst drained the disk in such a manner that no accretion occurs anymore .",
    "the implied time scale of this drainage is about 10  hr .",
