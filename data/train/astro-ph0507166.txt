    "the most popular mechanism for the formation of large - scale structure and motions in the universe is the gravitational growth of primordial density perturbations . according to this paradigm ,",
    "if the density perturbations are small enough to be approximated by a linear theory , then the peculiar acceleration vector @xmath5 induced by the matter distribution around position @xmath6 is related to the mass by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mean matter density and @xmath9 = @xmath10 is the density contrast of the mass perturbations . in linear theory ,",
    "the peculiar velocity field , @xmath11 , is proportional to the peculiar acceleration : @xmath12 where @xmath13 = 100 @xmath14 @xmath15 is the hubble constant and @xmath16 is the logarithmic derivative of the amplitude of the growing mode of the perturbations in mass with respect to the scale factor ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath17 is only weakly dependent on the cosmological constant ( lahav 1991 ) .    during the past twenty five years",
    ", particular attention has been paid to the study of the gravitational acceleration and the peculiar velocity vectors of the local group ( lg ) of galaxies .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) dipole is a doppler effect arising from the motion of the sun ( but see e.g. gunn 1988 and paczyski & piran 1990 who argue that the cmb dipole is of primordial origin ) . in this case",
    ", the dipole anisotropy of the cmb is a direct and accurate measurement of the lg peculiar velocity ( c.f .",
    "conklin 1969 and henry 1971 ) .",
    "the lg acceleration can also be estimated using surveys of the galaxies tracing the density inhomogeneities responsible for the acceleration . by comparing the cmb velocity vector with the acceleration vector obtained from the galaxy surveys , it is possible to investigate the cause of the lg motion and its cosmological implications .",
    "this technique was first applied by yahil , sandage & tammann ( 1980 ) using the revised shapley - ames catalogue and later by davis & huchra ( 1982 ) using the cfa catalogue .",
    "both catalogues were two - dimensional and the analyses were done using galaxy fluxes . since both the gravity and the flux are inversely proportional to the square of the distance , the dipole vector can be calculated by summing the flux vectors and assuming an average value for the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "lahav ( 1987 ) applied the same method to calculate the dipole anisotropy using maps based on three galaxy catalogues , ugc , eso , mcg .",
    "the most recent application of the galaxy flux dipole analysis was carried out by maller ( 2003 ) , using the two - dimensional two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) extended source catalogue ( xsc ) , with a limiting magnitude of @xmath18 .",
    "they found that the lg dipole direction is 16@xmath2 away that of the cmb .",
    "our ability to study the lg motion was greatly advanced by the whole - sky galaxy samples derived from @xmath19 _ galaxy catalogues_. yahil , walker & rowan - robinson ( 1986 ) , meiksin & davis ( 1986 ) , harmon , lahav & meurs ( 1987 ) , villumsen & strauss ( 1987 ) and lahav , rowan - robinson & lynden - bell ( 1988 ) used the two - dimensional @xmath19 data to obtain the lg dipole .",
    "the dipole vectors derived by these authors are in agreement with each other and the cmb dipole vector to within 10@xmath2 - 30@xmath2 degrees .",
    "the inclusion of galaxy redshifts in the dipole analyses allowed the estimation of the distance at which most of the peculiar velocity of the lg is generated ( _ the convergence depth _ ) .",
    "however , the estimates of the convergence depth from various data sets have not agreed .",
    "strauss ( 1992 , @xmath19 sample ) , webster , lahav & fisher ( 1997 , @xmath19 sample ) , lynden - bell , lahav & burstein ( 1989 , optical sample ) and da costa ( 2000 , a sample of early - type galaxies ) suggested that the lg acceleration is mostly due to galaxies @xmath20 , while other authors such as scaramella , vettolani & zamorani ( 1994 , abell / aco cluster sample ) , branchini & plionis ( 1996 , abell / aco cluster sample ) , kocevski ( 2004 ) and kocevski & ebeling ( 2005 , both using samples of x - ray clusters ) claimed that there is significant contribution to the dipole from depths of up to @xmath21200 @xmath3 .",
    "dipole analyses are often used to estimate the combination of matter density and biasing parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in theory",
    ", one can equate the velocity inferred from the cmb measurements with the value derived from a galaxy survey and obtain a value for @xmath24 . in practice , however , the galaxy surveys do not measure the true total velocity due their finite depth ( e.g. lahav , kaiser & hoffman 1990 and juszkiewicz , vittorio & wyse 1990 ) .",
    "the true @xmath25 , as obtained from the cmb dipole , arises from structure on all scales including structures further away than the distance a galaxy survey can accurately measure .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude / flux / diameter limit of the survey and any completeness variations over the sky introduce selection effects and biases to the calculations .",
    "these effects amplify the errors at large distances ( for redshift surveys ) and faint magnitudes ( for two dimensional surveys ) where the sampling of the galaxy distribution becomes more sparse .",
    "this , combined with the fact that we sample discretely from an underlying continuous mass distribution leads to an increase in shot noise error .",
    "there may also be a significant contribution to the dipole from galaxies behind the galactic plane ( _ the zone of avoidance _ ) .",
    "the analysis of the convergence of the dipole is further complicated by the redshift distortions on small and large scales which introduce systematic errors to the derived dipole ( _ the rocket effect _ , kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "the following sections discuss these effects in the context of two different models of biasing .    in this paper",
    ", we use the two micron all - sky redshift survey ( 2mrs , huchra 2005 ) to study the lg dipole .",
    "the inclusion of the redshift data allows the calculation of the selection effects of the survey as a function of distance and enables the study of convergence and thus improves the analysis of maller ( 2003 ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the two micron redshift survey is described in section  [ sec : dip : data ] .",
    "section 3 discusses the method used in the analysis including the different weighting schemes , the rocket effect and the choice of reference frames .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : dip : results ] .",
    "the final section includes some concluding remarks and plans for future work .",
    "the two micron all - sky redshift survey ( 2mrs ) is the densest all - sky redshift survey to date .",
    "the galaxies in the northern celestial hemisphere are being observed mainly by the flwo 1.5-m telescope and at low latitudes by the ctio . in the southern hemisphere , most galaxies are observed as a part of the six degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs , jones 2004 ) conducted by the anglo australian observatory . the first phase of the 2mrs is now completed . in this phase we obtained redshifts for approximately 23,000 2mass galaxies from a total sample of about 24,800 galaxies with extinction corrected magnitudes ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) brighter than @xmath0 .",
    "this magnitude limit corresponds to a median redshift of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 mpc ) .",
    "the majority of the 1600 galaxies that remain without redshifts are at very low galactic latitudes or obscured / confused by the dust and the high stellar density towards the galactic centre .",
    "figure  [ fig:2mrs ] shows all the objects in the 2mrs in galactic aitoff projection .",
    "galaxies with @xmath28 are plotted in red , @xmath29 are plotted in blue , @xmath30 are plotted in green and @xmath31 are plotted in magenta .",
    "galaxies without measured redshifts are plotted in black .",
    "the 2mrs can be compared with the deeper 2mass galaxy catalogue ( k@xmath3214th mag ) shown in jarrett ( 2004 , figure 1 ) .",
    "the 2mass has great photometric uniformity and an unprecedented integral sky coverage .",
    "the photometric uniformity is better than @xmath33 over the sky including the celestial poles ( e.g. jarrett 2000@xmath34 , 2003 ) .",
    "the uniform completeness of the galaxy sample is limited by the presence of the foreground stars . for a typical high latitude sky",
    "less than @xmath35 of the area is masked by stars .",
    "these missing regions are accounted for using a coverage map , defined as the fraction of the area of an 8@xmath368pixel that is not obscured by stars brighter than 10th mag .",
    "galaxies are then weighted by the inverse of the completeness although the analysis is almost unaffected by this process as the completeness ratio is very close to one for most parts of the sky .",
    "the stellar contamination of the catalogue is low and is reduced further by manually inspecting the objects below a redshift of @xmath37 .",
    "the foreground stellar confusion is highest at low galactic latitudes , resulting in decreasing overall completeness of the 2mass catalogue ( e.g. jarrett 2000@xmath23 ) and consequently the 2mrs sample .",
    "stellar confusion also produces colour bias in the 2mass galaxy photometry ( cambresy , jarrett & beichman 2005 ) but this bias should not be significant for the 2mrs because of its relatively bright magnitude limit .    in order to account for incompleteness at low galactic latitudes",
    "we fill the zone of avoidance ( the plane where @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the region @xmath40 ) with galaxies .",
    "we keep the galaxies with observed redshifts and apply two different methods to compensate for the unobserved ( masked ) sky :    * * method 1 * : the masked region is filled with galaxies whose fluxes and redshifts are chosen randomly from the whole data set .",
    "these galaxies are placed at random locations within the masked area .",
    "the masked region has the same average density of galaxies as the rest of the sky . *",
    "* method 2 * : the masked region is filled following yahil ( 1991 ) . the area is divided into 36 bins of @xmath41 in longitude . in each angular bin , the distance is divided into bins of 1000 .",
    "the galaxies in each longitude / distance bin are then sampled from the corresponding longitude / distance bins in the adjacent strips @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) .",
    "these galaxies are then placed in random latitudes within the mask region .",
    "this procedure gives similar results to the more elaborate method of wiener reconstruction across the zone of avoidance ( lahav 1994 ) .",
    "the number of galaxies in each masked bin is set to a random poisson deviate whose mean equals to the mean number of galaxies in the adjacent unmasked strips .",
    "this procedure is carried out to mimic the shot noise effects .    in reality , the shape of the zone of avoidance is not as symmetric as defined in this paper with galactic bulge centred at @xmath45 and with latitude offsets ( see kraan - korteweg 2005 ) . however , since we keep the galaxies in the masked regions , our dipole determinations should not be greatly influenced by assuming a symmetric mask .",
    "we test this by changing the centre of the galactic bulge .",
    "we confirm that our results are not affected .",
    "figure  [ fig:2mrs+mask ] shows the 2mrs galaxies used in the analyses in a galactic aitoff projection .",
    "the galaxies in masked regions are generated using the first ( top plot ) and the second method ( bottom plot ) .",

    "the isophotal magnitudes underestimate the total luminosity by @xmath51 for the early - type and @xmath52 for the late - type galaxies ( jarrett 2003 ) .",
    "following kochanek ( 2001 , appendix ) , the offset of @xmath53 is added to the @xmath47 magnitudes .",
    "the galaxy magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using the dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) and an extinction correction coefficient of @xmath54 ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "as expected , the extinction corrections are small for the 2mrs sample .",
    "the @xmath55 band @xmath56-correction is derived by kochanek ( 2001 ) based on the stellar population models of worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "the k - correction of @xmath57 , is independent of galaxy type and valid for @xmath58 .",
    "the fluxes @xmath59 are computed from the apparent magnitudes using @xmath60 where the zero point offset is @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the @xmath55 band ( cohen , wheaton & megeath 2003 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of the 2mrs is shown in figure  [ fig:2mrsnz ] .",
    "the @xmath19 pscz survey redshift distribution ( saunders 2000 ) is also plotted for comparison .",
    "the 2mrs samples the galaxy distribution better than the pscz survey out to @xmath63 .",
    "the selection function of the survey ( i.e. the probability of detecting a galaxy as a function of distance ) is modeled using a parametrised fit to the redshift distribution : @xmath64dz\\ ; , \\label{eqn : dnz2mrs}\\ ] ] with best - fit parameters of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this best - fit is also shown in figure  [ fig:2mrsnz ] ( solid line ) .",

    "galaxies that are members of the local group need to be removed from the 2mrs catalogue to maintain the internal consistency of the analysis .",
    "we used the local group member list of thirty five galaxies ( including milky way ) given in courteau and van den bergh ( 1999 ) to identify and remove eight lg members ( ic 10 , ngc 147 , ngc 185 , ngc 205 , ngc 6822 , m31 , m32 , m33 ) from our analysis . in section 4",
    ", we will calculate the acceleration on to the milky way due to these lg members .      in order to reduce the distance conversion errors ,",
    "we cross - identified 35 galaxies which have hst key project distances ( see freedman 2001 and the references therein ) and 110 galaxies which have distance measurements compiled from several sources ( see karachentsev 2004 and the references therein ) .",
    "we assign these galaxies measured distances instead of converting them from redshifts .",
    "in addition , we identify nine blue - shifted galaxies in the 2mrs which are members of the virgo cluster .",
    "we assign these galaxies the distance to the centre of virgo ( @xmath73 mpc , freedman 2001 ) . finally , there are four remaining blue - shifted galaxies without known distance measurements which are assigned to 1.18 @xmath74 mpc .",
    "thus by assigning distances to galaxies , we do not need to exclude any non - lg galaxy from the analysis .",
    "in order to compare the cmb and the lg dipoles , it is necessary to postulate a relation between the galaxy distribution and the underlying mass distribution . in this paper , we will use both a _ number weighted _ and a _ flux weighted _ prescription .",
    "although quite similar in formulation , these schemes are based on very different models for galaxy formation .",
    "the number weighted prescription assumes that the mass distribution in the universe is a continuous density field and that the galaxies sample this field in a poisson way . on the other hand ,",
    "the flux weighted model is based on the assumption that the mass in the universe is entirely locked to the mass of the halos of the luminous galaxies .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the galaxy and the mass distributions in the universe are directly proportional to each other and are related by a proportionality constant , the linear bias parameter @xmath23 : @xmath75 . in this case ,",
    "equation  [ eqn : v(r ) ] for the lg can be rewritten as @xmath76 where @xmath77 .    for the number weighted model , incomplete sampling due to the magnitude limit",
    "is described by the selection function , @xmath69 given in section  [ sec:2mass : nz ] .",
    "each galaxy @xmath78 is assigned a weight : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the values of the radial selection function and the completeness ( @xmath82 ) for each galaxy , respectively .",
    "the observed velocity of the local group with respect to the cmb is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mean galaxy density of the survey and @xmath85 is the unit vector of the galaxy s position .",
    "the sum in the equation is over all galaxies in the sample that lie in the distance range @xmath86 .",
    "calculated this way , the velocity vector does not depend on the hubble constant ( @xmath14 cancels out ) .    if the galaxies are assumed to have been drawn by a poisson point process from an underlying density field , then it is straightforward to calculate the shot noise errors .",
    "the shot noise is estimated as the @xmath87 of the cumulative variance , @xmath88 given by @xmath89 the shot noise error per dipole component is @xmath90 .      for this model ,",
    "each galaxy is a ` beacon ' which represents the underlying mass .",
    "this is characterised by the mass - to - light ratio @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 is probably not constant and varies with galaxy morphology ( e.g. lanzoni 2004 ) but mass - to - light ratios of galaxies vary less in the near - infrared than in the optical ( e.g. cowie 1994 ; bell & de jong 2001 ) . in the context of dipole estimation , this model of galaxy formation implies that the newtonian gravitational acceleration vector for a volume limited sample is ( * r*)&= & g _",

    "i s_i _ i , [ eqn : glum ] where the sum is over all galaxies in the universe , @xmath93 is the average mass - to - light ratio and @xmath94 is the flux of galaxy @xmath78 .",
    "the peculiar velocity vector is derived by substituting equation  [ eqn : glum ] into the second line of equation  [ eqn : v(r ) ] . for a flux limited catalogue",
    "the observed lg velocity is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the luminosity bias factor introduced to account for the dark matter haloes not fully represented by 2mrs galaxies and @xmath97 is the weight assigned to galaxy @xmath78 derived in the next section .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio , assumed as constant , is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the luminosity density so equation  [ eqn : vl ] is rewritten as : @xmath100    the flux weighting method ( originally proposed by gott ) has been applied extensively to two - dimensional galaxy catalogues ( e.g. yahil , walker & rowan - robinson 1986 , villumsen & strauss 1987 , lahav , rowan - robinson & lynden - bell 1988 ) and most recently to 2mass xsc ( maller 2003 ) .",
    "since these surveys lack radial information , the dipoles were calculated by either assuming @xmath101 ( e.g. maller 2003 ) or by using a luminosity function based on a redshift survey in a section of the two - dimensional catalogue ( e.g. lahav , rowan - robinson & lynden - bell 1988 ) . in either case",
    ", it was not possible to determine the convergence of the dipole as a function of redshift .",
    "the three - dimensional @xmath19 dipoles ( strauss 1990 , webster , lahav & fisher 1997 , schmoldt 1999 and rowan - robinson 2000 ) were derived using the number weighted scheme because the @xmath19 catalogues are biased towards star forming galaxies with widely varying mass - to - light ratios resulting in a very broad luminosity function making it difficult to estimate the distance .",
    "the 2mrs is mainly sensitive to total stellar mass rather than instantaneous star formation rates ( e.g. cole et al .",
    "2001 ) and consequently the 2mrs mass - to - light ratios do not have as much scatter .",
    "thus , for the first time , the 2mrs enables the determination the convergence of the flux dipole as a function of distance .",
    "there are many advantages to using the flux weighted model for the dipole calculation and these will be discussed in the coming sections .    for the flux weighted case ,",
    "the weighting function is derived as follows : let @xmath102 be the luminosity density in the volume element @xmath103 of a volume limited catalogue . in this case the dipole velocity is simply @xmath104 in practice , however , we have a flux limited catalogue with @xmath105 so only galaxies with luminosity @xmath106 are included in the survey .",
    "thus the total luminosity in the infinitesimal volume @xmath103 is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the observed luminosity and @xmath109 is the luminosity that was not observed due to the flux limit of the survey .",
    "substituting @xmath110 into equation  [ eqn : dv ] yields v _",
    "l(l0 ) & = & l_obs + & = & l_obs + & = & l_obs [ eqn : phil ] where @xmath111 is the flux weighted selection function . in figure",
    "[ fig : lum ] , the interpolated fit @xmath111 for the 2mrs galaxies is shown as a function of redshift .    thus , the overall weight factor , @xmath112 , is @xmath113 the luminosity density of the 2mrs is @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the survey volume .",
    "the value of @xmath116 is in good agreement with the value derived by kochanek ( 2001 ) , @xmath117 @xmath118 .",
    "we note that the number weighted selection function , @xmath69 , drops with distance faster than the luminosity weighted selection function , @xmath119 . at large distances , we observe only the most luminous galaxies , so the amount of ` missing ' luminosity from a volume of space is not as big as the number of ` missing ' galaxies . therefore ,",
    "as shown below , the flux weighted dipole is more robust at large distances than the number weighted dipole .    for the flux weighted scheme ,",
    "the shot noise is estimated as @xmath120 as the exact shot noise effects for the different models of galaxy formation are difficult to model , we will use the poisson estimate above as an indicator of uncertainties ( see also kaiser & lahav 1989 ) .",
    "however , we note that the quoted uncertainties overestimate the noise at small distances where the survey is volume limited and underestimate it at large distances where only the brightest galaxies are sampled .",
    "the uncertainties and the variation in the mass - to - light ratios relation also affect the calculation but they are not accounted for in this analysis .",
    "it is well known that the peculiar velocities distort the pattern of density enhancements in redshift - space .",
    "the peculiar acceleration of the local group calculated using redshifts instead of real distances will differ from the actual lg acceleration ( kaiser 1987 and kaiser & lahav 1989 ) .",
    "this effect , referred to as _ the rocket effect _ , is easily visualised by supposing that only the local group has a velocity in an homogeneous universe without any peculiar velocities .",
    "if the lg frame redshifts are used as distance indicators then there will be a spurious contribution from the galaxies that are in the direction of the lg motion .",
    "the prediction for net spurious acceleration is given by ( kaiser & lahav 1988 ) : @xmath121\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the minimum , @xmath123 is the maximum redshift of the survey and @xmath124 is the redshift for which the survey is volume limited ( @xmath1254500 for the 2mrs ) .",
    "the rocket effect is very important for the number weighted lg dipole calculation because of the dependence on @xmath126 in equation  [ eqn : obsdip ] .",
    "for the 2mrs , the predicted error from the rocket effect is a contribution to the total dipole by roughly @xmath127 .",
    "there are two ways to overcome this error .",
    "one is to work in real - space instead of redshift - space .",
    "this will be discussed in a forthcoming paper where the local group dipole will be calculated using the wiener reconstructed real - space density field .",
    "the other one is to use the flux weighted model . for the flux",
    "weighted lg dipole , the rocket effect is almost negligible as it plays a role only in the determination of the radii of the concentric spheres within which the dipole is calculated .",
    "brunozzi ( 1995 ) and kocevski , mullis & ebeling ( 2004 ) claim that the dipole in the lg and the cmb frames are over- and under - estimates of the real dipole , respectively .",
    "the redshift of an object is defined by @xmath128 where @xmath11 is the peculiar velocity of the object and @xmath129 is the observer s peculiar velocity . in the lg frame @xmath130and in the cmb frame @xmath131by definition .",
    "therefore , the redshift of a galaxy that has the same direction of motion as the lg would be larger in the cmb frame than that in the lg frame . in this case , since the acceleration vector is proportional to @xmath132 , the amplitude of the dipole in the lg frame is expected to be larger than the amplitude of the dipole in the cmb frame .",
    "as the dipole is thought to be dominated by the nearby objects that participate together with the lg in a bulk motion ( i.e. @xmath133 so that @xmath134 ) , it is often assumed that the real lg dipole is closer to the dipole in the lg frame than that in the cmb frame . on the other hand , branchini & plionis ( 1996 )",
    "find that the real - space reconstruction of the lg dipole gives a result halfway between the lg frame and the cmb frame values .",
    "we perform the analysis using both the lg and the cmb frame redshifts .",
    "all galaxies are referenced to the rest frame of the lg using the transformation in consistency with who use the same conversion courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the heliocentric redshift and @xmath137 and @xmath23 are the longitude and the latitude of the galaxy in the galactic coordinates , respectively .",
    "we convert from the lg frame to the cmb frame using cz_cmb&=&cz_lg+v_lg[(b)(b_lg ) + & + & ( b)(b_lg)(|l_lg - l| ) ] , where @xmath138 is the amplitude of the lg velocity with respect to the cmb and ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) is the direction of its motion .",
    "we use the cmb dipole value of bennett ( 2003 ) . using the first year of data from wmap",
    ", they find that the sun is moving at a speed of 369.5@xmath1413.0 km @xmath142 , towards ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) . using the revised values of the motion of the sun relative to the lg a velocity of 306@xmath14118 towards ( @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) derived by courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) , we find a lg velocity relative to the cmb of @xmath147 , towards ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) .",
    "the choice of reference frames highlights another advantage of the flux weighted dipole calculation .",
    "as the redshifts only enter the calculation in the determination of the radius of the concentric spheres , the results are robust to changes in reference frames .",
    "the results are presented in figures  [ fig : velvsdist]-[fig : directions ] .",
    "the top plots of figures  [ fig : velvsdist]-[fig : velvsdistcmb ] show the amplitudes and three spatial components of the acceleration on the local group ( top ) and the convergence of the angle between the lg dipole and the cmb dipole ( bottom ) as a function of distance in two reference frames . for these plots",

    "if we take out 420 galaxies in the perseus - pisces ridge ( defined by @xmath152 , @xmath153 , 4600 @xmath154 6000 @xmath155 ) and recalculate the convergence , the dip almost disappears and the convergence is dominated by the great attractor .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the perseus - pisces plays a significant role in the gravitational acceleration of the lg .",
    "the choice of method used to fill the masked regions does not have much effect on the results .",
    "the convergence of the misalignment angle for the second method is slightly more stable than the first method and the overall direction of the lg dipole is closer to the cmb dipole .",
    "since the galactic @xmath156 component is least affected by the zone of avoidance , the discrepancy between the amplitudes in each plot comes mainly from the galactic @xmath157 and @xmath158 components .",

    "the great attractor is most likely centred on the norma cluster ( @xmath159325@xmath2 , @xmath160 - 7@xmath2 , kraan - korteweg 1996 ) which lies very close to the obscured plane . although , the 2mrs samples the norma cluster much better than the optical surveys , the latitude range @xmath161 which is still obscured in the 2mrs may have structure that play an important role in the dipole determinations .",
    "in fact , scharf ( 1992 ) and lahav ( 1993 ) point out that there is significant contribution to the local flow by the puppis complex at low galactic latitudes that are not sampled by the 2mrs .",
    "kraan - korteweg & lahav ( 2000 ) point out that since the dipole is dominated by local structures , the detection of nearby galaxies can be more important to the dipole analyses than the detection of massive clusters at larger distances .",
    "we test this by excluding the five most luminous nearby galaxies ( maffei 1 , maffei 2 , ic342 , dwingeloo 1 and m81 ) from our analysis .",
    "remarkably , the direction of the resultant dipole moves much closer to that of the cmb ( see table  [ tab : tab3 ] ) .",
    "all of these galaxies expect m81 lie very close to the zone of avoidance and they are excluded from most dipole analyses either because they are not in the catalogue ( e.g. rowan - robinson 2000 ) or they are masked out ( e.g. maller 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , when we change our mask to match that of maller ( 2003 ) and keep m81 in the analysis our resulting dipole is only 3@xmath2 degrees away from the dipole calculated by maller ( 2003 ) .",
    "this illustrates the importance of the nearby structure behind the zone of avoidance .",
    "the comparison of tables  [ tab : tab2 ] and  [ tab : tab3 ] also highlights the vital role non - linear dynamics induced by nearby objects play in dipole calculations .",
    "maller ( 2003 ) investigate the non - linear contribution to the lg dipole by removing the bright galaxies with @xmath162 .",
    "they report that the lg dipole moves to within a few degrees of the cmb dipole .",
    "they repeat their calculations for the pscz survey and observe the same pattern .",
    "we do not observe this behaviour .",
    "when we remove the objects brighter that @xmath163 ( 428 galaxies ) , the misalignment angle of the resulting dipole decreases by @xmath164 for the flux weighted dipole and remains the same for the number weighted case .",
    "the dipole amplitudes decreases substantially in both cases , notably in the case of the flux dipole , suggesting that the brightest 2mrs galaxies play a significant role in inducing the lg velocity .",
    "the number weighted lg dipole looks very different in different reference frames ( figures  [ fig : velvsdist ] and  [ fig : velvsdistcmb ] ) whereas the flux weighted dipole is almost unaffected by the change .",
    "the number weighted dipole is similar to the flux weighted dipole in the lg frame .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is more accurate to use the lg frame redshifts than that of the cmb frame .",
    "the amplitudes of the number weighted lg dipole and the flux weighted lg dipole are very similar in the lg frame",
    ". however , the convergence of the misalignment angles of the flux and the number dipoles is quite different in both frames , especially at large distances .",
    "the angle of the flux weighted dipole is closer to the cmb dipole than its number weighted counterpart at all distances . with either weighting scheme ,",
    "the dipoles are closest to the cmb dipole at a distance of about 5000 and move away from the cmb dipole direction further away .",
    "however , the change in the direction of the flux weighted dipole is much smaller compared to the number weighted dipole and there is convergence within the error bars by 6000 .",
    "the misalignment angles in the lg frame at 130 @xmath74 mpc are 21@xmath2 and @xmath165 for the flux and the number dipoles , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy is probably mainly due to the fact the number dipole is plagued with errors due to the lack of peculiar velocity information . in fact , when we use just the redshift information instead of the distance measurements ( see section 2.4 ) the number dipole moves @xmath166 towards the cmb dipole .",
    "the flux dipole assumes that the mass traces light whereas the number dipole assumes that all galaxies have the same mass .",
    "the former assumption is of course more valid , however , since the amplitudes of the dipoles are so similar in the lg frame , we conclude that the equal mass assumption for the number weighted dipole do not introduce large errors and that the discrepancy results from the errors in distance .    in all figures ,",
    "@xmath167 and @xmath168 change with distance more rapidly in the number weighted scheme than the flux weighted . at further distances ,",
    "the flux weighted @xmath167 flattens whereas its number weighted counterpart continues to grow .",
    "it is expected that the @xmath169 directions are particularly sensitive to the shape of the zone of avoidance , although it is not obvious why the flux weighted components remain so robust . assuming the dipole has converged we can obtain values for @xmath170 ( number weighted ) and @xmath150 ( flux weighted ) by comparing the amplitude of our dipole estimates to the cmb dipole .",

    "the flux weighted dipole is in excellent agreement with the @xmath19 1.2 jy dipole ( webster , lahav & fisher 1997 ) which was obtained using a number weighted scheme but with an added filter that mitigates the shot noise and deconvolves redshift distortions .",
    "our number weighted dipole differs from their results .",
    "this is probably due to fact that the 2mrs number weighted dipole is plagued wit redshift distortions .",
    "webster , lahav & fisher ( 1997 ) obtain the real - space density field from that in the redshift - space using a wiener filter . in a forthcoming paper , we will use the same technique to address this issue .",
    "similarly , the 2mrs number weighted dipole also differs from the pscz dipole which was calculated using a flow model for massive clusters .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath19 qdot galaxies combined with abell clusters ( plionis , coles & catelan 1993 ) and the x - ray cluster only dipole ( kocevski , mullis & ebeling 2004 and kocevski & ebeling 2005 ) imply a significant contribution to the lg velocity by the shapley supercluster .",
    "kocevski & ebeling ( 2005 ) report a significant contribution to the lg dipole ( 56% ) from distances beyond 60 @xmath74 mpc .",
    "the discrepancy between their results and ours is possibly due to the fact that the 2mrs is a better tracer of the galaxies at nearby distances , whereas the x - ray cluster data are better samplers of the matter distribution beyond 150 @xmath74 mpc .",
    "the misalignment angle between the lg and the cmb dipole is smallest at 5000 where it drops to 12@xmath17@xmath2 and increases slightly at larger distances presumably due to shot - noise .",
    "this behaviour is also observed in the other dipole analyses ( e.g. webster , lahav , fisher 1997 & rowan - robinson 2000 ) .",
    "this is a strong indication that most of the lg velocity is due to the great attractor and the perseus - pisces superclusters .",
    "of course , we still can not rule out a significant contribution from shapley as we do not sample that far .",
    "however , it may be more important ask what the velocity field in the great attractor region is . in other words , whether we observe a significant backside infall towards the great attractor .",
    "the smallest misalignment angle at 13000 is 21@xmath18@xmath2 , found for the lg frame , flux weighted scheme using the second mask .",
    "this misalignment can be due to several effects :    * the analysis uses linear perturbation theory which is correct only to first order @xmath188 .",
    "there may be contributions to the lg dipole from small scales which would cause gravity and the velocity vectors to misalign , even with perfect sampling .",
    "however , ciecielag , chodorowski & kudlicki ( 2001 ) show that these non - linear effects cause only small misalignments for the @xmath19 pscz survey .",
    "however , removing the five most luminous nearby galaxies moves the flux dipole to ( @xmath189 , @xmath190,cz=20000 ) , 8@xmath2 closer to that of the cmb .",
    "this suggests that the non - linear effects might be very important in dipole determinations . *",
    "the sampling is not perfect and the selection effects of the surve will increase the shot noise - errors especially at large distances causing misalignments .",
    "* there may be uncertainties in the assumptions in galaxy formation and clustering .",
    "for example the mass - to - light ratios might differ according to type and/or vary with luminosity or the galaxy biasing might be non - linear and/or scale dependent .",
    "* there may be a significant contribution to the lg dipole from structure further away than the maximum distance of our analysis . *",
    "the direction of the lg dipole may be affected by nearby galaxies at low latitudes which are not sampled by the 2mrs . in the future",
    ", the masked regions will be filled by galaxies from other surveys such as the ongoing hi parkes deep zone of avoidance survey ( henning 2004 ) as well as the galaxies that are sampled from the 2mrs itself .    our initial calculations of the expected lg acceleration ( c.f .",
    "lahav , kaiser & hoffman 1990 ; juszkiewicz , vittorio & wyse 1990 ) suggest that the misalignment of 21@xmath18@xmath2 is within 1 @xmath191 of the dipole probability distribution in a cdm universe with @xmath192 . in a forthcoming paper ,",
    "the cosmological parameters will be constrained more vigourously using a maximum likelihood analysis based on the spherical harmonics expansion ( e.g. fisher , scharf & lahav 1994 ; heavens & taylor 1995 ) of the 2mrs density field .",
