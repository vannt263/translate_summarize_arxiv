    "<S> in some models of @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath1 gauge dynamics ( hep - th/9503163 and hep - th/9707244 ) , the tension of a string ending on @xmath2 external quarks is proportional to @xmath3 , @xmath4 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the ratios of the @xmath2-string tensions using the recently derived type iib gravity duals of @xmath0 susy gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> far in the ir these gravity duals contain an @xmath5 with @xmath6 units of r - r 3-form flux which , upon s - duality , turns into ns - ns 3-form flux . </S>",
    "<S> the confining @xmath2-string is described by a d3-brane wrapping an @xmath7 with @xmath2 units of world volume flux . for one of the gravity dual backgrounds ( maldacena - nuez ) </S>",
    "<S> a d3-brane probe calculation exactly reproduces the @xmath8 dependence , while for another ( klebanov - strassler ) we find approximate agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on the connection of the @xmath2-string tensions with d - brane tensions in the @xmath9 wzw model .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 325,245)pupt-2011 ( 325,260)hep - th/0111078    consider a gauge theory with gauge group @xmath1 and no dynamical fundamental matter . </S>",
    "<S> a wilson loop in the fundamental representation corresponds to transporting a probe quark around a closed contour @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the classic criterion for confinement is that this wilson loop obey the area law -w_1(c ) = t_1 a(c ) in the limit of large area . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting generalization is to consider wilson loops in antisymmetric tensor representations with @xmath2 indices where @xmath2 ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 corresponds to the fundamental representation as denoted above , and there is a symmetry under @xmath14 which corresponds to replacing quarks by anti - quarks . </S>",
    "<S> these wilson loops can be thought of as confining strings which connect @xmath2 probe quarks on one end to @xmath2 corresponding probe anti - quarks on the other . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath15 the probe quarks combine into a colorless state ( a baryon ) ; hence the corresponding wilson loop does not have an area law .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask how the tension of this class of confining strings depends on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> if it is a convex function , t_q+q < t_q + t_q  , then the @xmath2-string will not decay into strings with smaller @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the situation found by douglas and shenker ( ds ) @xcite in softly broken @xmath16 gauge theory , and later by hanany , strassler and zaffaroni ( hsz ) @xcite in the mqcd approach to confining @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory : [ universal ] t_q = ^2  , q=1,2 ,  , m-1   where @xmath17 is the overall ir scale . </S>",
    "<S> mqcd uses the 5-branes of 11-dimensional m - theory to engineer theories which belong to the same universality class as conventional gauge theories @xcite . using these tools </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to construct a model with @xmath0 supersymmetry and gauge group @xmath1 which far in the infrared exhibits confinement , chiral symmetry breaking and many other expected phenomena @xcite . in the uv , however , this model has extra degrees of freedom compared to the usual 4-d gauge theory ; hence there is no logarithmic running or dimensional transmutation . </S>",
    "<S> the formula ( [ universal ] ) gives definite quantitative predictions for the ratios of the string tensions in mqcd , but it is not clear to what extent these predictions might also be true for supersymmetric qcd . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we rederive this formula using a rather different set - up , gauge / string duality , suggesting that the formula may be quite robust .    </S>",
    "<S> quite recently , building on successes of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , gravity duals of confining @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories have been constructed . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> a certain @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath18 gauge theory was studied using @xmath19 d3-branes and @xmath6 wrapped d5-branes on the conifold . if @xmath19 is a multiple of @xmath6 , then this theory cascades down to @xmath1 in the ir @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 d5-branes are replaced by @xmath6 units of r - r 3-form flux which act to blow up a @xmath5 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the conifold is replaced by the deformed conifold _ </S>",
    "<S> i=1 ^ 4 z_i^2 = ^2  . </S>",
    "<S> the 10-d metric of the ks solution @xcite is a warped product of @xmath20 and the deformed conifold [ specans ] ds^2_10 = h^-1/2 ( ) dx_n dx_n + h^1/2 ( ) ds_6 ^ 2  , where @xmath21 is the calabi - yau metric of the deformed conifold . </S>",
    "<S> its explicit form in terms of certain angular 1-forms @xmath22 is @xcite [ metricd ] ds_6 ^ 2 = 12 ^ 4/3 k ( )  , where k()= ( ( 2 ) - 2)^1/32 ^ 1/3  . at @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> the angular metric degenerates into d_3 ^ 2= 12 ^4/3 ( 2/3)^1/3 [ 12 ( g^5)^2 + ( g^3)^2 + ( g^4)^2 ]  , which is the metric of a round @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the additional two directions , corresponding to the @xmath24 fibered over the @xmath5 , shrink as ^4/3 ( 2/3)^1/3 ^2 [ ( g^1)^2 + ( g^2)^2 ]  .    far in the infrared ( at small @xmath25 ) the warp factor @xmath26 approaches a constant of order @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for small @xmath25 the ten - dimensional geometry is approximately @xmath20 times an @xmath28 bundle over a round @xmath5 : [ apex ] ds_10 ^ 2 & ^4/3 2 ^ 1/3 a_0 ^ 1/2 g_s m dx_n dx_n + a_0 ^ 1/2 6 ^ </S>",

    "<S> was constructed by maldacena and nuez ( mn ) in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mn background is created by @xmath6 d5-branes wrapped over an @xmath24 . in the uv </S>",
    "<S> this solution approaches a linear dilaton background and the 4-d gauge theory decompactifies to the 6-d little string theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the ir the @xmath33 geometry with @xmath6 units of r - r flux is similar to that found in the ks solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity suggests that this geometry correctly describes the universality class of @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath1 gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> the universality of the geometric transition where @xmath6 d5-branes wrapping an @xmath24 are replaced by an @xmath5 with @xmath6 units of r - r flux was elegantly demonstrated by a superpotential calculation in @xcite . the type iia mirror of this geometric transition @xcite and its lift to m - theory on a manifold of @xmath34 holonomy @xcite have lead to new insights into both gauge theory and m - theory . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , however , we use the type iib gravity duals because there are no instanton corrections here , and also because we will make use of s - duality .    in the gravity </S>",
    "<S> dual the confining @xmath2-string is described by @xmath2 coincident fundamental strings placed at @xmath23 and oriented along the @xmath20 . in the solution of @xcite both @xmath35 and @xmath36 vanish at @xmath23 , but it is important that there are @xmath6 units of @xmath29 flux through the @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this r - r flux blows up the @xmath2 fundamental strings into a d3-brane wrapping an @xmath24 inside the @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> anti d3-branes blow up in the ks background into an ns5-brane wrapping an @xmath24 inside the @xmath5 , has been considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both are particular examples of the myers effect @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> although the blow - up can be shown directly , for brevity we build on a closely related result of bachas , douglas and schweigert @xcite . in the s - dual of our type iib gravity model , at @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> we find the @xmath37 geometry with @xmath6 units of ns - ns @xmath38 flux through the @xmath5 and @xmath2 coincident d1-branes along the @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> t - dualizing along the d1-brane direction we find @xmath2 d0-branes on an @xmath5 with @xmath6 units of ns - ns flux . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry is very closely related to the setup of @xcite whose authors showed that the @xmath2 d0-branes blow up into an @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we will find the same phenomenon , but our probe brane calculation is somewhat different from @xcite because the radius of our @xmath5 is different .    </S>",
    "<S> after applying s - duality to the ks solution , at @xmath23 the metric is dx_n dx_n + b m ( d^2 + ^2 d_2 ^ 2 )  , where @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we are now using the standard round metric on @xmath5 so that @xmath40 is the azimuthal angle ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the ns - ns 2-form field at @xmath23 is [ nsfield ] b_2 = m ( -(2)2 ) dd  , while the world volume field is f =- q2 dd  . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite closely we find that the tension of a d3-brane which wraps an @xmath24 located at the azimuthal angle @xmath40 is ~^1/2  . </S>",
    "<S> minimizing with respect to @xmath40 we find [ trans ] -qm = 1-b^22 ( 2 )  . </S>",
    "<S> the tension of the wrapped brane is given in terms of the solution of this equation by [ dbi ] t_q ~b  . </S>",
    "<S> note that under @xmath14 , we find @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a crucial property needed for the connection with the @xmath2-strings of the gauge theory .    -string tension versus @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is the mn result ( @xmath45 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is the ks result found numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the tension is normalized as in ( [ dbi]).,width=384 ]    although ( [ trans ] ) is not exactly solvable , we note that @xmath46 is small numerically . </S>",
    "<S> if we ignore the rhs of this equation , then @xmath47 and [ probe ] t_q~b  . </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the tension of this @xmath2-string in figure 1 , normalized as in ( [ dbi ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that , even when @xmath48 , the tension in the ks case is approximately @xmath49 of that in the @xmath45 case .    </S>",
    "<S> an analogous calculation for the mn background @xcite proceeds almost identically . in this background </S>",
    "<S> only the @xmath29 flux is present ; hence after the s - duality we find only @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath36 at the minimal radius is again given by ( [ nsfield ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a subtle difference however from the calculation for the ks background in that now the parameter @xmath51 entering the radius of the @xmath5 is equal to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this simplifies the probe calculation and makes it identical to that of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , now we find [ mainform ] t_qt_q =  , without making any approximations .    </S>",
    "<S> when we s - dualize back to the original background with rr - flux and @xmath2 f - strings , all the tensions are multiplied by @xmath52 but their ratios remain unchanged . hence , our argument applied to the mn background leads very simply to the ds  </S>",
    "<S> hsz formula for the ratios of @xmath2-string tensions ( [ mainform ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown earlier , this formula also holds approximately for the ks background .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that the gauge / string duality leads to results similar to those of mqcd , especially as the string tensions are not bps protected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we believe that we have strengthened the case for the robustness of ( [ mainform ] ) . since the probe brane is located at @xmath23 , our calculation should not be sensitive to the uv details of the gravity dual . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation relies only on the ir form of the dual background where the crucial feature of the geometry is an @xmath5 with @xmath6 units of r - r flux .    </S>",
    "<S> however , we have found that there is some non - universality in our final result , in that the calculation with the ks background gives a somewhat different answer than the calculation for the mn background ( only the latter produces exact agreement with the ds  </S>",
    "<S> hsz formula ( [ mainform ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , neither calculation describes the pure @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> our probe brane calculations are valid for large @xmath53 , while to study the pure @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory we need to take the limit of small @xmath53 @xcite . hence , we need some control over the @xmath54 corrections . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that such control can be achieved on the s - dual side where only the ns - ns flux is present far in the ir ( however , the string coupling becomes strong after the s - duality , so that the tree level calculation is not reliable ) </S>",
    "<S> .    in fact , the formula ( [ mainform ] ) agrees with the exact d - brane tensions , including all @xmath54 corrections , in the @xmath9 wzw model describing the @xmath5 with @xmath6 units of ns - ns flux @xcite . in the level @xmath55 @xmath9 wzw model the exact result for </S>",
    "<S> the tension of a d3-brane wrapping an @xmath24 within @xmath9 is @xcite t_q~ [ texact ]  . making the identification @xmath56 , which is customary for @xmath6 ns5-branes , ( [ texact ] ) matches exactly the result ( [ probe ] ) from the simple probe analysis in the mn background .    </S>",
    "<S> if similar control over the @xmath54 corrections could be achieved in the original sigma model with r - r flux , then we would learn the exact ratios of @xmath2-string tensions in the @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory from the spectrum of d - branes . </S>",
    "<S> in the meantime we may hope that the formula ( [ mainform ] ) , which as we have shown is related to exact wzw d - brane tensions , will turn out to be a good approximation to the gauge theory results that will one day be extracted from appropriate lattice calculations .- </S>",
