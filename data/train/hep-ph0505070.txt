    "the recent data in the rhic experiment suggest that the matter created by the rhic seems to be a strongly coupled system with possible quasi - bound hadrons contained@xcite .",
    "furthermore some lattice calculations , though in the quenched approximation , are consistent with the possible view that heavy - quark bound systems such as @xmath1 survive the deconfinement transition at finite temperature @xmath2@xcite .",
    "these developments have a possibility to change drastically the simple picture of the qgp phase that the system is composed of almost free quasi - particles , although such nontrivial properties of the qgp phase that it may contain quasi - hadronic excitations had been suggested earlier@xcite .    in the present letter",
    ", we shall argue that the _ dense _ quark matter at relatively low temperature can have also non - trivial properties , i.e. , a _ non_-fermi liquid ones , if the system is close to the critical temperature @xmath0 of the color - superconducting phase transition @xcite on a rather generic ground .",
    "first we notice that the low energy effective models of qcd show that the diquark gap at zero temperature may become as large as @xmath3mev@xcite at lower densities such as those corresponding to @xmath4mev with @xmath5 being the baryon - number chemical potential of the quark .",
    "accordingly , the ratio @xmath6 , which is a measure of the ratio of the inter - particle distance to the pair coherence length , may become as large as 0.2 to 0.3 .",
    "this value is much larger than those in the metal superconductors , i.e. , @xmath7 , which account for the validity of the mean - field approximation a l bcs theory for the electric superconductors .",
    "thus one sees that large fluctuations of the diquark - pair are expected , which may invalidate the mean - field approximation , in the color superconductors@xcite .",
    "in fact , our previous work with the fixed pairing coupling showed @xcite that there exists the precursory soft mode composed of the diquark - pair field even well above @xmath0 .",
    "one of the remarkable points there was that the coupling of the quark with the soft mode not only modifies the quark dispersion relation but also causes a _ depression _ of the quark spectral function around the fermi energy ; the depression was so large that a `` pseudogap '' is formed in the density of states ( dos ) of the quark even with the small diquark coupling that was employed .",
    "the above finding is interesting because they suggest that the properties of quarks at @xmath2 above but close to @xmath0 are altered from the typical fermi - liquid to the non - fermi liquid ones owing to the coupling to the precursory fluctuations of the diquark - pair field .",
    "the mechanism to cause such a non - fermi liquid behavior , however , might not have been clarified enough in the previous work .",
    "the purpose of the present letter is to elucidate the mechanism to realize such a non - fermi liquid behavior and argue that it is a generic feature of the heated quark matter in the vicinity of @xmath0 of the color superconductivity .    for this purpose ,",
    "we examine what happens in the quark properties in detail if the pairing fluctuations become stronger by increasing the diquark coupling constant @xmath8 ; we remark that the limiting case can often clarify physics .",
    "incidentally it may be noticed that @xmath8 indeed could have other values than that in the previous work without any contradiction with other principles and phenomenology .",
    "we calculate the dispersion relation and the spectral function of the quark in the t - matrix approximation@xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate the following for the first time : ( 1 )   the quark dispersion relation is so largely modified with the increasing @xmath8 that it becomes seemingly multiple - valued around the fermi surface near but above @xmath0 in the strong coupling regime .",

    "to describe a system at relatively low @xmath2 and @xmath9 , it is appropriate to adopt a low - energy effective theory of qcd @xcite . here , we consider the two - flavor quark matter in the chiral limit with the four - fermi quark - quark interaction@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the charge conjugation operator , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the antisymmetric flavor @xmath14 and color @xmath15 matrices , respectively .",

    "this resonating processes which are only effective around the fermi surface induce a virtual mixing between the particles and holes , i.e. a ( virtual ) bogoliubov transformation ! in other words , because the particle and hole energies @xmath73 and @xmath84 cross at the fermi energy as shown in fig .  [ fig : rscatt ] , the mixing between the particles and holes leads to the level repulsion of the energy spectrum of the particle and hole , which makes the gap - like structure as shown in the right panels of fig .",

    ", the softening of the pair fluctuations near @xmath0 is responsible for the resonant scattering to become effective .",
    "since the softening is described as the enhancement of @xmath86 around the origin in the @xmath41-@xmath40 plane , let us approximate the dynamical structure factor with the delta function at the origin ; @xmath87 the meaning of the choice of the pre - factor containing a @xmath85 in front of the delta functions will be clear later ; @xmath85 is to be related with the imaginary part of the @xmath2 matrix @xmath88 and the boson distribution function @xcite .",

    "( [ eqn : s ] ) can be diagrammatically interpreted as fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing](b ) , i.e. , the quarks interacting with a static source of the pair field @xmath85 .",
    "in this letter , motivated with the findings in our previous papers@xcite , we have tried to elucidate generically that the precursory pairing soft mode modifies the quasi - particle picture of the quark so much that the heated quark matter would become a non - fermi liquid in the vicinity of @xmath0 of the color superconductivity . for this purpose",
    ", we have examined the changes of the quark properties in detail when the diquark coupling is increased .",
    "we have found that in the strong coupling regime the quark dispersion relation is modified so greatly that it becomes multiple - valued around the fermi surface near but above @xmath0 .",
    "the stronger coupling also changes the quark spectral function as to have a gap - like structure rather than a depression .",
    "we have shown that these non - fermi liquid behaviors can be understood in terms of the resonant scattering between the incident particle and a particle around the fermi energy to make the pairing soft mode .",
    "although the present work is based on a model calculation , the mechanism proposed here for realizing a non - fermi liquid behavior of fermion systems can be model - independent .",
    "this is because the essential ingredient here is the scattering of a particle near fermi surface to make the soft mode which is inherent to any second - order or weak first - order phase transition",
    ". it would be thus intriguing to explore the quasiparticle picture near the critical temperature of other phase transitions of qcd matter , including the _ chiral _ phase transition at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "we should notice that there is another mechanism which causes a non - fermi liquid behavior of ungapped quark matter : a resummed perturbation theory shows @xcite that the coupling of the quark with unscreened long - range gauge ( gluonic ) fields gives rise to vanishing of both the residues of the quasiparticle excitations and the group velocity @xmath94 at the fermi surface at small temperature without recourse to any phase transition .",
    "notice that the vanishing group velocity implies the infinite density of states of quasiparticles , which is highly in contrast with our result , i.e. , the pseudogap formation as a precursory phenomenon of the csc at finite @xmath2 .",
    "although the perturbation theory adopted in @xcite is only applicable for extremely high - density quark matter , it would be interesting to see how the non - fermi liquid behaviors due to unscreened gluonic fields survive and compete with those owing to the soft mode of csc at moderate density and temperature .    in this work ,",
    "we have employed the non - selfconsistent t - matrix approximation which is essentially a linear approximation for the fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless the results obtained in this approximation can be close to reality so long as @xmath95 is not so small as noted in @xcite ; see @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the strong fluctuations of the pair - field were induced with the varied @xmath8 for fixed @xmath96 .",
    "similar results may be obtained for smaller @xmath97 but with a fixed @xmath8 since the fluctuations diverge as @xmath97 goes to zero .",
    "the situation , however , might not become so simple when the system may enter the ginzburg region where the nonlinear fluctuation effects play an essential role and somewhat moderate behavior may be realized for the quark properties",
    ". a renormalization - group treatment , for instance , would be necessary to incorporate the nonlinear effects of the fluctuations , which is beyond the scope of the present work and left for future investigations .",
