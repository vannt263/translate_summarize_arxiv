    "the phenomenon of the hysteresis , understood in a general sense , has been investigated so intensively for many decades that any list of references would be far from complete by any standards .",
    "it is very fortunate that in the last few years outstanding monographs @xcite@xmath6",
    "@xcite@xmath7 @xcite@xmath7 @xcite have been published in this field , and thus the author does not feel obliged to cite the large amount of old but important references .",
    "however , it is considered important to mention two papers of g. kdr @xcite@xmath6@xcite whose work has played a stimulating role in getting to the idea of reconsideration of the hysteresis theory by the present author .",
    "there is no doubt that the abstract reformulation of the preisach model @xcite given by krasnoselskii and a. pokrovskii @xcite and summarized by i. d. mayergoyz @xcite in his book resulted in an improved mathematical clarity in the hysteresis theory , but the stochastic nature of the hysteresis still has not been treated with sufficient mathematical rigor .    the aim of the present paper is to define a stochastic model of hysteresis and to derive exact equations for the probability distribution functions describing the state variations in hysteretic processes as a function of increasing as well as decreasing control parameters .",
    "the vocabulary of magnetic hysteresis will be used for convenience from now on , however , the concepts can easily be generalized for any hysteretic phenomenon .",
    "let us assume that the unit volume of the system consists of many small abstract regions , called `` particles '' which are characterized by four random variables : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the absolute value of the particle magnetization is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "if the particle magnetization is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the external magnetic field @xmath11 then the particle is in the state @xmath0 @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the random value @xmath14 corresponds to a local field at which the state @xmath0 jumps to the state @xmath1 and similarly the @xmath15 transition occurs at the random local field @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath14 will be called as u - field and d - field .",
    "these two random variables express the obvious fact that each particle `` feels '' not only the external magnetic field @xmath11 , but also the interaction field due to the adjacent particles and the random field originated from the inhomogenities of the surrounding environment .",
    "these particles characterized by the random variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be regarded as `` independent '' abstract elements of the system , and they will be called _ ``",

    "the transition curves form a random rectangular hysteresis loop which is almost in all cases asymmetrical in the co - ordinate system of magnetization versus external magnetic field since the u- and d - fields are supposed to be random .",

    "the determination of this probability and the derivation of the equations for `` up '' and `` down '' magnetizations versus magnetic field will be the task of the next section .",
    "let us denote by @xmath30 the joint distribution function of the random u- and d - fields .",
    "from the physical point of view it is quite obvious that the u - field can not be smaller than the d - field , so the stochastic inequality @xmath31 must be satisfied . it is easy to show @xcite that the joint distribution function of @xmath9 and @xmath14 satisfying the condition @xmath32 can be written in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the unit step function .",
    "it is clear that the joint density function of the u- and d - fields can be given by @xmath35 provided that the condition @xmath36 is valid .",

    "[ fig8 ] the first - order descending curves which start from different points of the ascending limiting branch * la * can be seen .",
    "the curves starting from the points due to the field values @xmath206 are plotted to _ the points of remanences _ * r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 * which are obviously different from the stationary ( i. e. , the accommodated ) values .",
    "the non - accommodated * nr * and stationary remanences * sr * versus start field are shown in fig .",
    "as it is seen the non - accommodated remanences can be negative below a critical start field * cr * since the initial negative saturation has a significant effect on the first - order transition curves .",
    "the stationary remanence curve * sr * calculated from the equations ( [ eq47 ] ) and ( [ eq48 ] ) is non - negative in all points of the start field interval .",
    "the _ influence of the parameter @xmath207 _ on the shape of the major hysteresis loop can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "as it is expected the larger is the parameter @xmath207 the wider is the hysteresis loop , i.e. the larger non - homogeneity in a system ( e.g. in a magnetic sample ) results in a higher `` coercive force '' .",
    "it seems to be useful to calculate the _ accommodated ( stationary ) hysteresis loops _ for different pairs of reversal points @xmath144 and @xmath143 .",
    "the hysteresis loops plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] correspond to the reversal points : @xmath208 ( loop * ml1 * ) , @xmath209 ( loop * ml2 * ) , @xmath210 ( loop * ml3 * ) . for the calculation we used the parameter values : @xmath211 and @xmath212 . for the sake of completeness _ the virgin curve _ * vc * calculated by ( [ eq50 ] ) and the major loop * ll * bounded by the limiting ascending and descending curves",
    "are also shown in the figure .",
    "the stochastic model clearly shows that all accommodated minor loops corresponding to cyclic inputs between the same two consecutive extremum values are not only congruent but simply identical .    in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] three accommodated first - order minor loops denoted by * 1 , 2 , 3 * can be seen .",
    "the descending branches of the loops are started from the field values @xmath213 , and each of the ascending branches returns exactly to the same point that the corresponding descending branch left .",
    "the returning curves have an apparent slope discontinuity with regard to the major loop * ala*.    at this point it is worth to make a remark of somewhat historical nature .",
    "as it is well - known preisach s idea for his model was originated from the _ quadratic rayleigh relation _ which can be easily obtained @xcite assuming a uniform distribution of the @xmath214- and @xmath215-fields over the `` preisach triangle '' .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the stochastic model the calculated hysteresis loops almost perfectly coincide with that calculated by the rayleigh formula when the reversal fields @xmath144 and @xmath143 and so the magnetizing field @xmath216 $ ] are sufficiently small . the hysteresis loop * r * defined by reversal points @xmath217 and @xmath218 in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] can be very well approximated by the equations @xmath219 where @xmath220 in the case of parameter values @xmath221 and @xmath212 . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] the squares correspond to the values calculated by the quadratic equations .",
    "the excellent aggreement with the curves of the stochastic model indicates that the rayleigh law can be reproduced in a straightforward way in the stochastic model .",
    "this model differs from the original preisach model in a very essential point in relation to the _ reversal point susceptibility .",
    "_ namely , the non - zero initial susceptibility at the turning points is an inherent property of the stochastic model , while the traditional preisach model can produce positive initial slope only if the preisach function is supposed to have a dirac - delta like singularity along the boundery of the preisach triangle , and that is a rather artificial requirement introduced by mayergoyz @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility vs. magnetizing field is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] for the parameter values : @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "the shape of the calculated curve can be expected on the basis of physical considerations and corresponds to those found experimentally .",
    "the estimation of the joint density function @xmath175 from measured hysteresis curves was beyond the scope of our present theoretical consideration .",
    "of course , one may attempt in simple cases to estimate the parameters of a plausible density function ( e. g. , ( [ eq54 ] ) ) by an appropriate data evaluation procedure .",
    "it has been shown that the preisach model of hysteresis can be replaced by a new model based on exact concepts of the probability theory . in this model",
    "the phenomenon of hysteresis has been described as a _",
    "stochastic process _",
    "defined on a set of all possible values of the control parameter the reversal ( turning ) points of which are markov points of the process .",
    "the one dimensional distribution function of the stochastic process has been exactly determined and the magnetizations versus up and down magnetic fields have been calculated as expectation values of the stochastic process .",
    "it has been proven that the magnetizing process becomes stationary with increasing number of magnetizing cycles .",
    "it means that for the description of the accommodation process there is no need of any artificial auxiliary assumption since the stochastic model contains the phenomenon of accommodation inherently . in general case",
    "the model is able to describe the symmetric as well as the asymmetric hysteresis . in relatively small magnetizing fields",
    "the quadratic rayleigh law can be easily obtained from the equations of the stochastic model .",
    "it is important to note that the turning point susceptibilities have non - zero finite values in contrary to the traditional preisach model which does not take consequently into account the random nature of the elementary switching process .",
    "finally , the stochastic model shows that all stationary loops corresponding to the same two limiting values of the magnetizing field are equivalent but the non - stationary loops are non - congruent and in general not closed .",

    "<S> it turns out that the reversal points of the control parameter are markov points which determine the stochastic evolution of the process . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the branches of the hysteresis loop are converging to fixed limit curves when the number of cyclic back - and - forth variations of the control parameter between two consecutive reversal points is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> this convergence to limit curves gives a clear explanation of the accommodation process . </S>",
    "<S> the accommodated minor loops show the return - point memory property but this property is obviously absent in the case of non - accommodated minor loops which are not congruent and generally not closed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the traditional preisach model the reversal point susceptibilities are non - zero finite values . the stochastic model can provide a surprisingly good approximation of the raylaigh quadratic law when the external parameter varies between two sufficiently small values . </S>",
    "<S> the practical benefits of the model can be seen in the numerical analysis of the derived equations . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand the calculated curves are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations and on the other hand , the estimation of the joint distribution function of the up and down switching fields can be performed by using the measured hysteresis curves . </S>"
