    "the importance of event - by - event fluctuations in the initial conditions context of heavy - ion collisions was first pointed out by miller and snellings who added nucleon position fluctuations to existing smooth ( i.e. ensemble - averaged ) glauber initial conditions @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations explain the experimental observation of non - vanishing anisotropic flow in central cu - cu and au - au collisions @xcite and of odd flow harmonics @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "recently attention has turned to a new source of event - by - event fluctuations , namely fluctuations in the transverse distribution of color charge within the colliding nucleons .",
    "these fluctuations are evidenced by large multiplicity fluctuations observed in minimum bias @xmath3 collisions and suggest that sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom may also play an important role in determining the event - by - event geometry of the initial state in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "in this work , we develop a toy model for imprinting sub - nucleonic fluctuations on the transverse energy density profiles produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the study is motivated by recent work of mller and schfer in which they calculate the mean normalized covariance function @xmath4 $ ] for the transverse energy density fluctuations of gluon fields in central au - au collisions at 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the authors approximate the collision system by two infinite slabs of nuclear matter with fixed gluon saturation momentum @xmath1 for which they take the value corresponding to the nuclear thickness function in the center of a central au - au collision .",
    "we texture a given transverse energy density profile with additional fluctuations using a turning band gaussian random field simulator ( tbsim ) @xcite that includes several configurable covariance functions .",

    "these unphysical fluctuations can be eliminated by mapping the gaussian random variable onto a positive definite negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) .",
    "there is a long history of modeling fluctuations in @xmath3 collisions with negative binomial distributions ( for recent examples see @xcite ) .",
    "writing @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the sampled value , @xmath17 is its mean and @xmath18 controls its variance , we identify @xmath19 with @xmath20 . in the limit of large @xmath17 ( we take @xmath21 ) , the nbd becomes a continuous function @xmath22 of the reduced variable @xmath23 whose width parameter @xmath18 we adjust such that its variance @xmath24 agrees with the squared gaussian width @xmath25|_{r=0}{\\,=\\,}(\\delta\\epsilon(0)/\\epsilon_0)^2{\\,=\\,}(0.684)^2 $ ] .",

    "we should note , however , that our fluctuation texture assumes constant ( i.e. position - independent ) @xmath47 or @xmath48 , with a value expected ( on average ) in the center of central au - au collisions .",
    "more realistically , @xmath49 should vary inversely with the position - dependent nuclear thickness function ( which , on average , is largest in the fireball center ) : @xmath50 consequently , the mller - schfer texture with constant @xmath45fm provides an approximate _ lower _ bound on the eccentricity enhancement caused by sub - nucleonic fluctuations in @xmath44gev au - au collisions .    to obtain an estimated upper bound on the eccentricity enhancement caused by sub - nucleonic fluctuations , we inflate the correlation length @xmath48 to the radius of our gaussian nucleons , @xmath51fm and repeat the texturing procedure .",

    "; in more peripheral collisions , fluctuations in the nucleon positions dominate the fluctuation effects on @xmath40 .",

    "while we qualitatively confirm earlier findings @xcite that such fluctuations tend to increase the @xmath40 , only relatively small enhancements ( smaller than those reported in @xcite ) are found for realistic values of the gluon field correlation length .",
    "correlations over larger distances generate larger eccentricities . due to the assumption of a position - independent saturation momentum @xmath47 or correlation length @xmath48 ,",
    "our implementation of sub - nucleonic fluctuations is much less realistic than the one in the ip - glasma model of refs .",
