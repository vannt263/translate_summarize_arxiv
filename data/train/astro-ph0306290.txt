    "within the well - accepted framework of hierarchical galaxy formation , dwarf ( @xmath11 @xmath12 10@xmath13 m@xmath14 ) galaxies are the first systems to collapse and start forming stars in the early universe , supplying the building blocks from which more massive galaxies form later through merging and accretion ( white & rees 1978 ; dekel & silk 1986 ; ikeuchi & norman 1987 ) .",
    "many dwarfs , however , survive and end up intact in the local universe , where they still represent the most common kind of galaxy observed at the present time ( marzke & da costa 1997 ) .    as remnants of the galaxy - formation process , present - day dwarfs may have been sites of the earliest star formation activity in the universe .",
    "however , this hypothesis is challenged by the physical properties of blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies .",
    "bcds have very blue colors typical of young stellar systems .",
    "they are currently experiencing intense star - formation ( rates of 0.01@xmath210 m@xmath14 yr@xmath15 ; thuan 1991 ) , but still contain large h  i reservoirs ( a few times 10@xmath16 m@xmath14 ; thuan & martin 1981 ) .",
    "their properties are consistent with relatively short duration ( @xmath17 a hubble time ) for the ongoing burst .",
    "they are also characterized by low metal abundances ( between about z@xmath14/2 and z@xmath14/50 as inferred by h  ii region observations ; thuan et al .",
    "1994 ) , indicative of a chemically unevolved interstellar medium ( ism ) , and some of them contain much less heavy - element enrichment than the majority of the observed high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the most metal - poor ( @xmath18 @xmath12 1/20 z@xmath14 ) bcds have been pointed out as good candidate `` primeval '' galaxies in the nearby universe , with ages less than 100 myr as inferred from their chemical properties ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "if indeed some bcds turn out to be young galaxies , their existence would support the view that star formation in low - mass systems has been inhibited till the present epoch ( e.g. , babul & rees 1992 ) .",
    "unveiling the evolution of extreme bcds is thus of primary importance for understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the evolution of a galaxy is driven by the evolution of its primary constituents , stars and gas .",
    "stars have a key role in consuming and returning gas , producing luminous and mechanical energy , and synthesizing nearly all elements heavier than he in the universe .",
    "stars chemically influence the surrounding ism depending on their mass : @xmath10-elements ( e.g. , o ) are mostly released by sne  ii from massive stars on short time scales ( @xmath12 50 myr ) ; c and n are mainly produced by intermediate - mass stars on longer time scales ( @xmath19 300 myr ) ; fe is principally supplied by sne  ia on time scales @xmath19 1 gyr .",
    "this can lead to unusual non - solar abundance ratios of the ism when coupled with the extreme star - formation histories of bcds .",
    "a high level of star formation can pollute the gas with @xmath10-elements and result in an overall @xmath10/fe enhancement .",
    "on the other hand , the contribution from sne  ia during a long quiescent period can significantly increasing the fe content , thus considerably decreasing the @xmath10/fe ratio .",
    "the situation can also be complicated by the presence of strong galactic winds triggered by sne  ii that , coupled with the shallow gravitational potential of low - mass systems , can differentially eject metals into the intergalactic medium ( e.g. de young & heckman 1994 ; marlowe et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the chemical properties of the ism are , therefore , a fossil record of the star - formation history of a galaxy .",
    "however , different spectroscopic abundance estimators sample different elements , as well as different phases of the ism and different look - back times . measured abundances in the gaseous component",
    "also depend on how well , and on what time scale , the ism is mixed , and on what time scale freshly produced metals cool and become visible .",
    "the chemical homogeneity of the h  ii regions ( e.g. , kobulnicky & skillman 1996 , 1997 ) suggests that mixing is quick and efficient in dwarf systems .",
    "emission lines from warm ( @xmath20 @xmath21 10@xmath22 k ) ionized gas have long been the primary chemical diagnostic in the ism of star - forming galaxies .",
    "this technique is highly refined and well constraining , especially in the determination of o abundances ( e.g. , skillman 1998 ) .",
    "h  ii regions probe the state of the gas at the birth of massive stars ( a few myr ago ) .",
    "however , they may already be self - polluted with very recently produced metals ( kunth & sargent 1986 ) .",
    "x - ray observations offer abundance indicators for the hot ( @xmath20 @xmath21 10@xmath23@xmath210@xmath16 k ) phase of the ism ( persic et al . 1998 ; martin , kobulnicky , & heckman 2002 ) , probing the metals released during the ongoing burst that are still trapped within the galactic wind and are not yet mixed with the photoionized gas .",
    "uv absorption lines from neutral gas supply another way to infer the metallicity of the ism .",
    "these lines sample lower temperature regions ( @xmath20 @xmath12 10@xmath22 k ) which are less likely to be involved in the star - formation , thus avoiding more the problem of self - pollution .",
    "metal abundances of bcds have been widely investigated in the past through detailed studies of h  ii regions ( e.g. , izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "however , chemical properties of other ism phases still remain missing pieces of a complicated puzzle .",
    "the h  i content in bcds is only @xmath24 10% of the dynamical mass ( which is dominated by dark matter ) , but amounts to @xmath24 90%@xmath295% of the total baryonic mass ( e.g. ,",
    "kniazev et al . 2000 ) .",
    "as the dominant component of the baryonic matter , neutral gas could hide the bulk of metals . of necessity , we must correctly address this issue in order to understand the chemical ( and physical ) evolution of bcds .",
    "recently , the launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( @xmath0 ; moos et al .",
    "2000 ) has provided access to the rich system of far - uv absorption lines .",
    "the strong blue continua of the spectra , combined with the high sensitivity and resolution of @xmath0 in the 900@xmath21200    wavelength range , allow us for the first time a characterization of the metal content in the neutral ism of bcds .",
    "prior to @xmath0 , a similar analysis of the rest - frame uv spectra has been possible only for the high - redshift absorbing systems along the lines of sight to quasars ( e.g. , lu et al .",
    "1996 ) or for the gravitationally lensed lyman break galaxy ms  1512cb58 at @xmath25 = 2.7276 ( pettini et al .",
    "2002 ) , thanks to the superior sensitivity of telescopes and spectrographs in the optical . up to now",

    "2001 ) have already been published .",
    "however , i  zw  18 has been re - observed by @xmath0 with an additional @xmath24  60,000 s of integration time ( only @xmath24 30,000 s are available for the first dataset ) since the publication of the data .",
    "i  zw  18 is also one of the most interesting and modelled bcds in the local universe . for all these reasons ,",
    "we have retrieved from the archive , combined , and analyzed the two @xmath0 datasets of i  zw  18 .",
    "this paper reports the results of our analysis .",
    "discovered by zwicky in 1966 , i  zw  18 remains the bcd with the lowest metallicity inferred from the oxygen content of its h  ii regions ( 1/50 z@xmath14 ; e.g. , izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "although it is often referred to as `` the most metal - poor galaxy known '' , it is still two orders of magnitude more metal rich than the most metal - poor stars in the milky way ( fe / h @xmath21 @xmath24 ; cayrel 1996 ) .",
    "i  zw  18 has always been regarded as the best candidate for a truly `` young '' galaxy in the local universe , with an estimated age less than 40 myr ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "its youth has , however , been questioned by the recent hst discovery in the optical ( aloisi , tosi , & greggio 1999 ) and near - infrared ( stlin 2000 ) of a well - defined population of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars at least several hundred myr and possibly up to a few gyr old .",
    "moreover , detailed modeling of broad - band colors in the optical and near infrared ( hunt , thuan , & izotov 2003 ) has shown that ages of a few hundred myr are in better agreement with the integrated properties of i  zw  18 , even if as much as 22% of the total mass could be contributed by older stars . due to its very peculiar nature ,",
    "i  zw  18 has been extensively studied for the last three decades , but its evolutionary state still remains a matter of debate .",

    "low extinction is reported in most studies , and the galaxy has not been detected by the infra - red astronomical satellite ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "two @xmath0 datasets for i  zw  18 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; @xmath35 , @xmath36 = + 4484183 ) were obtained on 1999 november 27 and 2001 february 11 , respectively , as part of@xmath0 team programs p198 and p108 .",
    "the first observations detected the target only in the lif channels ( @xmath1 = 979@xmath21188  ) for a total exposure time of @xmath24 31,600  s , @xmath24 30% of which occurred during the orbital night .",
    "these spectra have been extensively analyzed by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and levshakov et al .",
    "the most recent dataset includes both lif and sic channels ( @xmath1 = 905@xmath21188  ) for a total integration time of @xmath24 63,500  s , of which @xmath24 60% occurred during orbital night . in both observing runs",
    "i  zw  18 was centered in the large aperture ( lwrs , @xmath37 ) which amply covered the whole galaxy .",
    "the data were retrieved from the mast archive and processed with the latest release of the @xmath0 calibration pipeline ( version 2.0 ) .",
    "this was , however , updated to include the new set of background files and the correct error estimate that were later available in version 2.1 .",
    "the first part of the pipeline was applied to individual exposures in order to get correct doppler shifts and grating motions from the orbital parameters in the headers of single images .",
    "all exposures relative to each dataset were then combined with the calfuse task `` ttag_combine '' , taking into account residual velocity offsets .",
    "we finally ran the last part of the calibration pipeline on the final combined raw images . this non - standard procedure allowed for a better estimate of the background and a more accurate spectral extraction in case of faint sources .",
    "a binning by a factor of 6 was applied to the data in order to improve the identification of spectral features without degrading the spectral resolution .",
    "the extracted 1d spectra , one per dataset , were then combined together to obtain a unique spectrum with an exposure time around 95,100 s and 63,500 s in the lif and sic channels , respectively .",
    "this increased the s / n per resolution element by a factor of @xmath24 1.7 in the lif channels compared to the original spectra , and extended the spectral coverage to @xmath32 @xmath38 979     in the sic channels .",
    "residual wavelength shifts among different segments were then estimated and applied using the lif  1a channel as a reference .",
    "a remaining zero - point wavelength offset of @xmath39    was corrected by requiring the galactic ism lines to fall at @xmath24 0 km s@xmath15 .",
    "we avoided combining data from the eight different channels into one composite spectrum over the whole @xmath0 spectral range because the instrumental resolution and sensitivity vary as a function of wavelength .",
    "we instead constructed a final spectrum in the interval @xmath1 = 917@xmath21188    by adding together segments of spectra taken from the channel with the highest sensitivity in a certain wavelength region , mainly sic  2a , lif  1a , and lif  2a .",
    "the redundant information at lower s / n contained in the segments not used was , however , considered for a consistency check .    only data taken during the orbital night ( with a s / n lower by a factor of 1.3 )",
    "were considered in those parts heavily contaminated by emission from terrestrial o  i and n  i airglow .",
    "this procedure was applied in order to minimize geocoronal contamination .",
    "we expected emission from geocoronal lines to be practically absent in the so - called `` night '' data .",
    "this can be easily verified by an eye inspection of the final spectrum , where , e.g. , the saturated o  i @xmath321039 absorption from the milky way goes to zero intensity , indicating practically no residual contribution from one of the strongest airglow lines . on the other hand , absorption lines in i",
    "zw  18 are redshifted of a few pixels ( e.g. , @xmath24 2.5   for o",
    "i @xmath321039 ) , so that residual airglow contamination does not represent a problem in any case .",
    "a nominal spectral resolution of @xmath40/@xmath32 @xmath21 10000 , corresponding to @xmath41 @xmath21 30 km s@xmath15 , was derived by taking into account the aperture and the size of the galaxy ( 10 ) .",
    "an observed upper limit around 40 km s@xmath15 was instead estimated by measuring the fwhm of the narrowest h@xmath8 lines arising from the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "a final spectral resolution of 35 @xmath9 5 km s@xmath15 over the whole wavelength range was finally adopted .",
    "the noise spectrum was calculated through photon statistics propagation of object and sky spectra .",
    "the final s / n is @xmath24 7 , 17 , and 18 per resolution element at 950    ( sic  2a ) , 1050    ( lif  1a ) , and 1150    ( lif  2a ) .",
    "the fit of the continuum was performed by interpolating between points of the observed flux free of apparent absorption .",
    "this is not particularly easy because of the limited s / n of the spectrum .",
    "members of the team independently estimated the continuum for a consistency check , and the differences were always well below the noise uncertainties .",
    "errors associated with measured quantities in the @xmath0 spectrum are from counting statistics only and were calculated from the s / n of the data .",

    "three absorption line systems at three different radial velocities are clearly present : the well - known high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) at @xmath2160 km s@xmath15 , the milky way ( mw ) at 0 km s@xmath15 , and i  zw  18 at @xmath24 750 km s@xmath15 . the high - velocity cloud and galaxy systems",
    "have already been briefly discussed by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and will not be detailed further . here",
    "we will concentrate on the absorption line system in i  zw  18 .",
    "we derived column densities of h  i and heavy elements from the @xmath0 spectra of i  zw  18 by line - profile fitting of the observed absorption lines .",
    "standard theoretical voigt profiles were convolved with the gaussian instrumental resolution and fitted to the data .",
    "the package fitlyman ( fontana & ballester 1995 ) in midas for multi - component fitting was used for this purpose .",
    "this method is more powerful than a simple curve - of - growth analysis ( based on the equivalent width of the absorption lines ) because it allows for @xmath42 the deblending of multiple components along the line of sight contributing to the same absorption , and @xmath43 the simultaneous and independent fit of contaminating absorption components .",
    "we were able to fit absorption lines of all the ions considered in i  zw  18 with very simple velocity component models ( one component , except for fe  ii where two components were necessary ) .",
    "the real physical situation described by i  zw  18 far - uv spectra is , however , more complex .",
    "@xmath0 detects a non - linear average absorption over the full extent of the stellar background sources , since its large aperture includes the whole galaxy .",
    "this implies that the observed lines arise from a combination of many unresolved velocity components from different absorbing clouds along the many lines of sight .",
    "moreover , some lines of sight may have saturated absorption , even if the composite profile does not go to zero intensity ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1991 ) .    jenkins ( 1986 ) , on the other hand , has demonstrated that the single - velocity approximation ( one - velocity component ) applied to complex blends of features gives nearly the correct answer ( the simulated - to - true column density ratio rarely goes below 0.8 ) if the distribution function for the line characteristics is not irregular ( e.g. , bimodal , see also savage & sembach 1991 ) .",
    "this result holds also if different lines have different saturation levels or doppler parameters @xmath44 .",
    "since our @xmath0 data of i  zw  18 average over the whole galaxy , we expect a quite regular distribution of the kinematical properties of the single absorbing components .",
    "we thus believe we amply fall within the regime were the single - velocity approximation is valid .    in light of these considerations , we preferred to maintain a simple approach in the determination of the column densities with the line - profile fitting method .",
    "we thus avoided the introduction of additional free parameters , i.e. the number of intervening clouds and their velocity distribution , since we believe the resolution of the data does not allow to correctly constrain the real physical situation represented by this type of observation . in the single - velocity approximation the fitting parameter @xmath44 has no precise physical meaning , but is rather the result of the combination of both the various line doppler widths present ( due , e.g. , to turbulent and/or thermal broadening ) and the various velocity separations among the different line components ( hobbs 1974 ) . on the other hand , according to jenkins ( 1986 ) the column density is well constrained .",
    "in addition , the column density of a certain ion is even better constrained if several lines with different values of @xmath45 ( @xmath32 is the rest - frame wavelength and @xmath46 the oscillator strength of the absorption ) are available for a simultaneous fit , and the results are independent of saturation problems affecting the strongest lines .",
    "however , in order to check the quality of the results with the line - profile fitting and the single - velocity approximation , we also determined total column densities of heavy elements by applying the apparent optical depth method ( savage & sembach 1991 ) .",
    "the apparent column density of an ion in each velocity bin , @xmath47 in units of @xmath4 ( km s@xmath15)@xmath15 , is related to the apparent optical depth in that bin @xmath48 by the expression : @xmath49 the apparent optical depth is directly calculated from the observed intensity in the line at velocity @xmath41 , @xmath50 , by @xmath51~,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the intensity in the continuum .",
    "@xmath47 is an apparent column density per unit velocity because its value depends on the resolution of the spectrograph and on the apparent shape of the line .",
    "the total apparent column density , @xmath53 , is obtained by direct integration of equation ( 1 ) over the velocity interval where line absorption takes place @xmath54 in the limit where the absorption line is weak ( @xmath55 @xmath56 1 ) or fully resolved ( the fwhm of the line is larger than the instrumental fwhm ) , the total apparent column density @xmath53 and the true column density @xmath27 are equal .",
    "the apparent optical depth method is very powerful for determining column densities .",
    "its strength lies in the fact that no assumption needs to be made concerning the velocity distribution of absorbers , i.e. , it does not depend on the number of intervening clouds along the single or multiple lines of sight .",
    "however , it does not provide a correct answer for quite strong lines that are not fully resolved . in the case of our resolution of @xmath24 35 km s@xmath15",
    ", the line - profile fitting should give a more accurate measure of the ionic column densities compared to the apparent optical depth method , especially for stronger lines .",
    "the latter can nevertheless be more potent in unveiling hidden saturation if two or more lines with relatively different @xmath57 values are available .",
    "such a situation will easily manifest itself with a column density from the apparent optical depth method being smaller for lines with higher @xmath57 values . in our analysis ,",
    "the similarities between the column densities obtained with the line - profile fitting and the apparent optical depth method for weak ( and thus , more optically thin ) lines ( @xmath58 m ) strengthen our results , and justify the single - velocity approximation approach (   7.1 ) .",
    "finally , we want to point out another caveat generic to this type of @xmath0 observations where the whole star - forming galaxy is included in the spectroscopic aperture .",
    "the far - uv radiation we detect is the one not intercepting the opaque dense clumps with a high dust and molecular content ( even if with a very low covering factor ; hoopes et al .",
    "the far - uv light is thus biased toward lower metallicity regions .",
    "the more diffuse ism , however , can contain a certain amount of dust ( meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1999 ; hoopes et al .",
    "2003b ) , thus of metals .",
    "in addition , there are indications from uv / optical studies that the dust content in i  zw  18 is relatively low ( meurer et al . 1999 ; cannon et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we hence do not expect that our results are heavily biased toward regions with lower metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , the strongest result of our analysis , i.e. the metal enrichment of the neutral gas , would still remain valid even in case dust plays an important role .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum of i  zw  18 exhibits a multitude of stellar and interstellar lines .",
    "most of the stellar lines are blends of multiple transitions .",
    "the strongest and cleanest photospheric line is c  iii @xmath321176 , although this is a multiplet centered at 1175.6  .",
    "we observed this line at a central wavelength of @xmath32 = 1178.59 @xmath9 0.04  , taking into account that its red side could be contaminated by a p - cygni profile from stellar winds of ob supergiants .",
    "we inferred a redshift of @xmath59 = 0.00254 @xmath9 0.00003 , corresponding to a systemic velocity of @xmath60 = 761 @xmath9 9 km s@xmath15 .",

    "we observed , however , the following trend : the total column density is always consistent within @xmath100 with the value of 15.09 @xmath9 0.06 dex of our best two - velocity component fit , even if the corresponding error increases with the number of velocity components ( i.e. , @xmath101 = 15.25 @xmath9 0.14 dex for five components ) .",
    "we finally derived total column densities by applying the apparent optical depth method (   3 ) in order to discover hidden saturation in the unresolved components , as well as to test the one- or two - velocity approximation models with a measurement independent of the velocity structure of the absorbers .",
    "column densities of i  zw  18 absorption lines estimated with this method are listed as @xmath102 in column 9 of table  2 , the only exception being si  ii @xmath32989 , which is saturated ( if @xmath52 approaches 0 , @xmath103 becomes undetermined and the method is no longer applicable ) .",
    "column 8 gives the velocity interval @xmath104 over which equation ( 3 ) was calculated . by inspecting the values of @xmath102 for fe  ii",
    ", it is evident that the two strongest lines , @xmath321144 and @xmath321063 , have a much lower apparent column density indicative of possible saturation . on the other hand ,",
    "the average over the remaining transitions gives a value for @xmath102 of 14.99 @xmath9 0.14 dex , which is consistent within the errors with the value of @xmath99 .",
    "for o  i , the lower value of @xmath102 in the line @xmath321039 suggests saturation problems .",
    "nevertheless , the other line , @xmath32976 , gives a value for @xmath102 of 15.96 @xmath9 0.12 dex , which is in agreement with profile fitting measurements .",
    "the only unsaturated si  ii line , @xmath321020 , is blended and the corresponding @xmath102 is a lower limit consistent with our profile fitting measurements .",
    "two lines are available for ar  i. the blended @xmath321048 line gives a lower limit for the column density , while the weak @xmath321066 line has a value of @xmath102 in agreement with @xmath99 .",
    "n  i has two absorptions that we used to infer the column density , and the mean value for @xmath102 of 14.46 @xmath9 0.05 dex is again consistent with the profile fitting results .",
    "the application of the apparent optical depth method strengthens our assumption that in general the velocity models that we considered for the line - profile fitting are good representations of the @xmath0 data , even if the real physical situation is more complex . in the following",
    ", we will thus adopt @xmath99 for the final column densities of all ions in the neutral ism of i  zw  18 .",
    "however , we caution the reader that o  i could be an exception .",
    "it is important to notice that the strengths of the o  i lines differ by a factor of 3 , yet there is still a 0.35 dex difference in @xmath102 .",
    "the true o  i column density may thus be underestimated by as much as 0.5 dex , if the apparent column densities listed in table  2 are corrected for unresolved saturation as recommended by savage & sembach ( 1991 ) .",
    "this would happen if the velocity distribution of the neutral gas contains very strong components that are substantially under - resolved by @xmath0 .",
    "such an upward correction of the o  i column density is still consistent within @xmath105 with the profile fitting results and would bring the o  i abundance in the neutral gas up to a value closer to that in the h  ii regions .",
    "however , in the absence of additional information we will assume that the line - profile fitting and the apparent optical depth results for the weak line of o  i ( @xmath106 ) give the correct column density for o  i.      the major concern in abundance determinations from uv absorption - line analysis is represented by ionization and dust - depletion correction effects .",
    "ionization effects are usually neglected , and abundances are derived by assuming that the primary ionization state of an element in the neutral gas is representative of the total amount of the element . from galactic interstellar studies",
    "it is well known that the singly ionized stage is the dominant one for most elements because their first ionization potential is below 13.6 ev ( the h@xmath107 ionization threshold ) and their second one is above it .",
    "the neutral stage instead prevails for those elements having the first ionization potential above 13.6 ev .",
    "the reason for this is that the bulk of the h  i gas with @xmath108 @xmath19 10@xmath109 @xmath4 is self - shielded from @xmath110 @xmath111 13.6 evphotons , but transparent to @xmath110 @xmath38 13.6 evphotons .",
    "this means that fe  ii , c  ii , si  ii , and p  ii , as well as o  i , n  i , and ar  i will be the dominant ionization stages of these elements in the neutral gas of i  zw  18 .    some of the ions that are dominant ionization states in h  i regions may also be produced in photoionized clouds where h  i is a small fraction of the total hydrogen content .",
    "the formation of metal absorption lines in both ionized and neutral regions can have a significant impact on element abundance determinations .",
    "this problem has been recently tackled in detail for damped ly@xmath10 systems ( dlas ) by howk and sembach ( 1999 ) and vladilo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using the cloudy code ( ferland et al .",
    "these authors confirm previous findings that corrections to interstellar abundances are negligible for the majority of elements observed in dlas in the case of high column densities , i.e. n@xmath112 @xmath19 10@xmath91 @xmath4 ( but see prochaska et al .",
    "2002 , or izotov et al .",

    "the ionization corrections are in general smaller when a stellar spectrum dominates over an external uv background as ionizing source of the ism .",
    "this is the case in i  zw  18 , where the radiation field is produced by its young massive stars .",
    "the relative mixture of neutral and ionized gas contributing to an absorbing spectrum can be empirically determined by measuring adjacent ions of the same elements , e.g. , fe  ii / fe  iii or al  ii / al  iii ( howk & sembach 1999 ; sembach et al .",
    "2000 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the case of i  zw  18 we observed fe  iii @xmath321122 .",
    "fe  iii absorption is purely interstellar when a hot young o stellar population dominates the @xmath0 spectral range ( walborn et al .",
    "2002 ; pellerin et al .",
    "2002 ) , and only originates in the ionized gas associated with h  ii regions .",
    "the regions with neutral gas are instead where the bulk of fe  ii absorption is produced .",
    "we followed the recipe of sembach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to correct our derived fe  ii abundances for ionization effects .",
    "since the @xmath0 aperture integrates over a large area , we considered their `` composite '' model for the warm ionized ism of the mw ( a combination of overlapping low - excitation h  ii regions ) as a better representation of the ionized gas conditions in i  zw  18 .",
    "unfortunately , fe  iii @xmath321122 is blended with fe  ii @xmath321125 from the mw and the hvc , but we could take this into account with the line - profile fitting .",
    "the total column density of fe  iii we inferred from our measurements is 13.61 @xmath9 0.08 dex ( fig .",
    "[ feiiiplot ] ) .",
    "this is also the fe  ii contribution from the ionized gas , since half of the iron is in fe  iii and half in fe  ii ( table  5 of sembach et al .",
    "this implies that @xmath1213.70 dex of the total fe  ii column density ( 15.09 @xmath9 0.06 dex ) measured in the @xmath0 spectra might be due to ionized gas , corresponding to an ionization fraction of at most 5% .",
    "if we correct for this factor , we get an fe  ii column density in the neutral gas of 15.07 dex , just 0.02 dex lower than measured , and well within the 1@xmath77 errors .",
    "the radiation field is likely to be much higher in i  zw  18 than in the mw thanks to the higher density of younger and hotter stars responsible for it .",
    "in addition , the ism metallicity in i  zw  18 is much lower than in the mw , this property implying higher temperatures for the gas since less heavy elements are available for cooling .",
    "both effects go in the direction of favoring more iron in the fe  iii ionization state than in the fe  ii , thus much lower ionization corrections .",
    "for example , if we consider for our model a higher ionization parameter of @xmath113 = @xmath114 instead of the value of @xmath115 of the mw , we obtain that @xmath24 70% ( and not 50% ) of the iron is fe  iii , corresponding to an ionization fraction less than 2% .",
    "fe  iii is thus a very good tracer of ionized gas ( much better than al  iii ) , since it is the dominant state of iron for a wide range of ionizing conditions ( e.g. , effective temperature of the ionizing central star or ionization parameter ) .",
    "the ionization correction for fe  ii is one of the largest : in the ionized gas all the other elements like h , o , n , and ar are found mostly ( @xmath19 80% ) in an ionization state higher ( ii ) than the one we detect in the uv spectra ( i ) .",
    "we can thus assess that ionization effects should be negligible in our @xmath0 data .",
    "the only exception is si , where as much as @xmath24 90% of si  ii ( 70% for a more plausible higher ionization parameter of @xmath113 = @xmath114 ) could arise in the ionized gas .",
    "however , no absorption lines of si  iii are available in the @xmath0 band to correctly take this into account",
    ".    the presence of dust in the ism can represent another serious complication in the interpretation of the metal abundances .",
    "refractory elements ( e.g. , fe and si ) are more easily locked into dust grains than non - refractory ones ( e.g. , o , ar , n ) .",
    "this can clearly alter the total heavy element abundances .",
    "observations of the local ism provide hints of selective depletions acting in dense clouds within our galaxy ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "there is evidence of dust also in the dlas , systems that i  zw  18 resembles in its h  i column density .",
    "the reddening of qsos lying behind dla absorption is a clear clue of dust extinction ( pei , fall , & bechtold 1991 ; fall & pei 1993 ) .",

    "molecular hydrogen has also been found recently in 15%-20% of a sample of dlas and usually in those systems with the highest metallicities and largest dust depletions ( ledoux , petitjean , & srianand 2003 ) . on the contrary",

    "a bidimensional map of the extinction has been obtained from the ratio between h@xmath10 and h@xmath63 hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "the optical extinction , @xmath117 , varies significantly from one region to another , suggesting a patchy dust distribution , but the extinction is always small , with a maximum value of @xmath24 0.5 mag and a mean value of only @xmath24 0.15 mag .",
    "this is not an unexpected trend , since low - metallicity galaxies should have a lower and more patchy dust content ( morgan & edmunds 2003 ) .",
    "dust traced by emission - line spectra does not necessarily correspond to dust content in the neutral ism ( different geometries and different regions are involved ) .",
    "this is the reason why it is important to have an indication of depletion directly from our @xmath0 absorption measurements .",
    "the same methods applied to dlas could be used for this purpose .",
    "in general , dust properties are often assumed to be similar to those of the galactic interstellar dust , and the amount of depletion is simply scaled by taking into account variations of the dust - to - metal ratios ( vladilo 1998 ; savaglio 2001 ) . however , the observed abundances arise from the combination of _ i ) _ a non - solar nucleosynthesis , _ ii ) _ a non - solar star - formation history , and _",
    "iii ) _ a certain dust depletion pattern . in order to disentangle these effects , refractory and non - refractory elements originating from similar nucleosynthetic histories",

    "this is clearly an approximation , but we do not expect significant corrections due to the very low metal content of the galaxy . moreover , among all the chemical elements considered , only si and fe are sensitive to this problem",
    ". for reference , in dlas the depletion corrections can be as high as @xmath24 0.2@xmath20.4 dex for si , and @xmath24 0.7@xmath21.1 dex for fe ( garnett 2002 ) .",

    "the difference between h  i and h  ii regions ( if not related to systematic uncertainties ) can not be explained with ionization effects in the neutral gas , since o  i is tightly related to h  i , so that [ o  i / h  i ] = [ o / h ] .",

    "part of the difference between neutral and ionized gas could be due to ionization effects .",
    "ar does not generally behave like h ( and o ) in the ism despite similar ionization potentials ( sofia & jenkins 1998 ; jenkins et al .",

    "the iron abundance in the neutral ism of i  zw  18 is one of our most reliable estimates . on the other hand , the fe content in the southeast h  ii region ( izotov et al .",

    "the iron abundance is derived from a single fe@xmath122 emission line ( [ fe  iii ] @xmath123 ) , but most of the iron is in fe@xmath124 .",

    "the first straightforward conclusion is that the abundances of heavy elements in its neutral ism are low , but not zero : @xmath10-elements are between @xmath24 1/100 and 1/200 solar , fe is @xmath24 1/60 solar , and n is @xmath24 1/800 solar . according to panagia ( 2002 ) , a metallicity above 10@xmath126 z@xmath14 for elements arising from sne  ii ( i.e. , @xmath10-elements ) is the result of one or more episodes of metal enrichment .",
    "this implies that the neutral gas in i  zw  18 has already been enriched with the products of at least one star - formation event , and is not primordial in nature .",
    "however , its extremely low abundances do not leave much room for a large amount of star - formation .",
    "the abundance pattern we observe in the different gaseous components of i  zw  18 directly leads to a second conclusion .",
    "the metal content is significantly lower in the h  i than in the h  ii regions , apart from iron which is the same .",
    "the @xmath10-elements are mainly produced by sne  ii on short time scales ( less than 50 myr ) , while iron is mostly released by sne  ia on time scales longer than 1 gyr .",
    "this may indicate that the h  ii regions , compared to the neutral ism , have been additionally enriched in @xmath10-elements ( and nitrogen ) by more recent star formation activity .",
    "can we invoke self - enrichment of the h  ii regions by their massive stars ?",
    "in general , the concept of self - enrichment ( kunth & sargent 1986 ) does not agree with the homogeneity observed in h  ii regions in dwarf star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , kobulnicky & skillman 1997 ) .",
    "i  zw  18 is not an exception from this point of view ( skillman & kennicutt 1993 ; vlchez & iglesias - parmo 1998 ; legrand et al .",
    "in addition , larsen , sommer - larsen , & pagel ( 2001 ) present theoretical evidence that the supershells triggered by sne  ii and stellar winds from massive stars are always well within the h  ii regions for almost the whole existence of these regions ( less than 10 myr ) .",
    "this implies that elements newly synthesized in an ongoing burst are trapped in the hot phase of these superbubbles and can never be well mixed with the emitting gas within the h  ii region .",
    "it is thus highly unlikely that we are witnessing direct self - enrichment in the h  ii regions of i  zw  18 .    a key element for shedding light on the chemical evolution of i  zw  18 is nitrogen .",
    "the nature and origin of nitrogen in galaxies has been debated for a long time . in massive metal - rich galaxies , n / o increases roughly linearly with o / h ( torres - peimbert , peimbert , & fierro 1989 ; van zee , salzer , & haynes 1998a ) .",
    "this is the typical behavior for `` secondary '' nitrogen , produced by intermediate - mass stars on time scales longer than @xmath24 250 @xmath2 300 myr .",
    "in contrast , dwarf star - forming galaxies ( thuan et al .",
    "1995 ; kobulnicky & skillman 1996 ; van zee et al . 1997 ) and low - metallicity h  ii regions in spirals ( van zee et al .",
    "1998a ) show a relatively constant",
    "n / o _ versus _ o / h with the plateau around @xmath119(n / o ) = @xmath21.5 .",

    "the nitrogen abundance in i  zw  18 is higher in the h  ii regions than in the neutral ism , consistent with what is found for @xmath10-elements .",
    "this indicates that there has been metal enrichment by star formation that occurred long enough ago for primary nitrogen to have been released back into the ism .",
    "this dates the star formation to at least @xmath24 10 myr ago ( if massive stars are responsible ) , or several hundred myr ago ( if intermediate - mass stars are responsible ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation would be that the current episode of star - formation traced by the h  ii regions has been going on long enough for nitrogen enrichment to have occurred in this part of the galaxy ism .",
    "we can place time constraints on the different star - formation episodes with simple considerations of the physical scales involved .",
    "the nucleosynthetic activity responsible for the enrichment in the h  ii regions must have taken place long enough ago for gas mixing to be efficient in the central optical part of the galaxy ( as testified by the homogeneity of the h  ii regions ; izotov et al .",
    "the linear scales involved are around @xmath240.5 kpc , corresponding to mixing time scales of @xmath24 100 myr ( roy & kunth 1995 ) .",
    "it must have also started recently enough so that mixing on physical scales comparable to the extended h  i envelope surrounding the star - forming regions is incomplete .",

    "( 1998b ) .",
    "this corresponds to mixing time scales around @xmath24 1 gyr ( tenorio - tagle 1996 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the star - formation process responsible for the additional enrichment of the h  ii regions must have started more recently than 1 gyr ago and have been active for at least a hundred myr .",
    "this rules out contribution to primary nitrogen only from massive stars with very short lifetimes ( @xmath24 10 myr ) . by the same reasoning ,",
    "the ancient star - formation episode responsible for the metals in the h  i must have started at least @xmath24 1 gyr ago to allow for diffusion of metals from the central stellar production sites .",
    "the times of the various star - formation activities can be further constrained by considering the behavior of abundance ratios involving elements produced on different time scales .",
    "one of the most powerful tools from this point of view is o / fe . according to gilmore & wyse ( 1991 ) , at the beginning of the very first star - formation activity we should find a value of [ o / fe]@xmath21 + 0.63 dex ( + 0.45 on the old oxygen solar scale ) which reflects the relative production of o and fe from a mean sn  ii .",
    "as soon as the first sne  ia start to explode , this ratio begins to decrease due to additional fe contributions .",
    "the decrement is more rapid in the case of a short burst than for continuous star - formation .",
    "the onset of another burst will simultaneously , and almost instantaneously , increase the contribution to the ism of both o and fe from sne  ii . the o / fe ratio will suddenly jump to a higher value , even if always lower than the initial value due to the continuous contribution from sne  ia to fe only . in the neutral ism of i  zw  18 we infer a value of [ o / fe ] = @xmath20.30 @xmath9 0.30 .",
    "this clearly indicates a substantial fe enrichment from sne  ia in the h  i gas , and ages longer than 1 gyr for the oldest episode . on the other hand ,",
    "a supersolar value of [ o / fe]=+0.45 @xmath9 0.09 is found in the southeast h  ii region , where the fe / h ratio ( a metallicity indicator ) is instead the same within the errors .",
    "this implies that more recent and relatively young star - formation activity ( with no contribution from additional sne  ia , thus with an age less than 1 gyr ) is responsible for the further enrichment of the ionized gas .",
    "the epochs we infer by analyzing the behavior of o / fe are thus in agreement with our considerations of the mixing processes for both the ancient and more recent star - formation episodes .",
    "the o / fe results on the age of the ancient star - formation activity are quite strong .",
    "they are still valid even if iron is partly depleted onto dust grains , since the contribution from sne  ia would be higher in this case .",
    "also infall of primordial gas ( e.g. , matteucci & chiosi 1983 ; edmunds 1990 ) would not alter this conclusion , as its net effect would be the dilution of the whole metal content and would not affect relative abundances .",
    "what could influence these findings is the presence of gas outflow , especially if it is selectively enriched in @xmath10-elements from sne  ii ( pilyugin 1993 ; marconi , matteucci , & tosi 1994 ; bradamante , matteucci , & dercole 1998 ; recchi et al .",
    "2002 ; but see also recchi , matteucci , & dercole 2001 for an alternative enrichment in iron from sne  ia ) .",
    "the loss of oxygen through galactic winds would decrease the o / fe ratio in a way that could mimic the iron contribution from sne  ia .",
    "however , our @xmath0 data provide no observational evidence of a gas outflow in i  zw  18 . martin ( 1996 ) discusses the existence of a bipolar h@xmath10 bubble with a dynamical age of 15@xmath230 myr that will eventually evolve into a galactic wind .",
    "this does not imply that part of the ism has already been ejected from the galaxy . from their analysis of the o",
    "vi @xmath11032 , 1038 doublet , heckman et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find no indication of a `` warm '' coronal phase associated with i  zw  18 , although this could reflect the very low oxygen abundance . the lack of large - scale outflows in the early stages of i  zw  18 evolution is theoretically predicted by recchi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in their chemical evolution model ,",
    "a galactic wind enriched in sne  ii products sets in only in the last 15 myr with the second and more intense of two bursts of star formation .    under the assumption of no gas outflow",
    ", we calculated the number of sne  ia that have enriched the neutral ism of i  zw  18 . the following procedure was applied .",
    "the fe abundance in the h  i gaseous component probably arises from both sne  ii and sne  ia .",
    "we disentangled their relative contribution by taking into account the quantity of oxygen produced by sne  ii during the star - formation event and the prescriptions by gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky ( 1997 ) .",
    "this amounts to @xmath2450% for sne  ia and @xmath2450% for sne  ii in the case of [ o / fe ] = @xmath20.30 ( @xmath20.12 on the old oxygen solar scale ) .",
    "we obtained a total fe mass of @xmath24 700 m@xmath14 by assuming a total h  i mass of @xmath24 2.6 @xmath6 10@xmath92 m@xmath14 ( van zee et al .",
    "1998b ) and an fe abundance equal to @xmath24 1/60 solar ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath21.76 ) .",
    "only @xmath2450% of this mass has been produced by sne  ia .",
    "considering a typical sn  ia yield of @xmath24 0.74 m@xmath14 for iron ( gibson et al .",
    "1997 ) , we inferred that @xmath24 470 sne  ia are required in order to justify the metal enrichment in the neutral ism of i  zw  18 .    the n / o ratio can also help us in further investigating the nature and properties of the star - formation activity in i  zw  18 .",
    "unlike the fe ratio , n / o is free of dust depletion .",
    "moreover , in the case of i  zw  18 ionization problems do not affect its value since n  i should behave like o  i ( see   8.1 ) .",
    "we have already mentioned the existence of a plateau in the n / o _ versus _ o / h relation for metal - poor star - forming galaxies and its explanation as being due to primary nitrogen .",
    "many authors ( edmunds & pagel 1978 ; garnett 1990 ; larsen et al .",
    "2001 ; contini et al . 2002",
    "; chiappini , romano , & matteucci 2003 ) are able to reproduce this plateau with their chemical evolution models by simply considering a bursting regime coupled to the time delay between the delivery into the ism of o from massive stars and n from intermediate - mass stars .",
    "primary nitrogen from massive stars is thus not a necessary condition , at variance with the early suggestions by izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) . on the other hand , henry , edmunds , & kppen ( 2000 )",
    "propose a more continuous low - level ( @xmath24 10@xmath126 m@xmath14 yr@xmath15",
    "kpc@xmath128 ) of star - formation activity to justify the existence of the plateau .",
    "this last model is more consistent with the picture that bcds have an underlying old ( several gyr ) metal - poor stellar population with bursts superimposed on it ( e.g. , the chemical evolution model of i  zw  18 by legrand 2000 ) .",
    "every galaxy that evolves slowly will thus maintain a relatively low metallicity over a significant fraction of a hubble time since the total metallicity is directly related to the star - formation rate integrated over time .",
    "values of @xmath119(n / o ) well below the plateau , as observed in some dlas ( lu , sargent , & barlow 1998 ; centurin et al .",
    "2003 ) , can be found only in the very early stages of the n / o evolution , when the stellar objects have ages younger than or comparable to the typical time scales for the release of primary n from intermediate - mass stars ( henry et al .",
    "2000 ; centurin et al .",
    "2003 ) .    from our @xmath0 observations we obtain a value of @xmath119(n / o ) = @xmath21.54 @xmath9 0.26 for @xmath119(o / h ) = @xmath25.37 @xmath9 0.28 .",
    "the neutral ism of i  zw  18 thus follows the flat trend in n / o _ versus _ o / h observed for dwarf star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , garnett 2002 ) , as well as metal - rich dlas ( centurin et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , it is well above the values found at similar metallicities in those o - poor dlas considered to be chemically young systems ( lu et al .",
    "1998 ; centurin et al .",
    "2003 ) . hence , h  i gas in i  zw  18 seems to have been polluted by star - formation at least as old as the typical lag time ( 250@xmath2300 myr ) for n released by intermediate - mass stars , and probably older than 1 gyr ( based on the results for o / fe ) .",
    "a value of @xmath119(n / o ) = @xmath21.57 @xmath9 0.06 for @xmath119(o / h ) = @xmath2 4.82 @xmath9 0.03 is inferred for the southeast h  ii region of i  zw  18 .",
    "such a similar n / o but a higher o content in the ionized gas compared to the neutral ism are possible only if the galaxy is experiencing or has experienced additional star - formation which has released additional oxygen from sne  ii but also additional nitrogen from massive or intermediate - mass stars .",
    "silicon is the last element that we can consider to constrain the star - formation history of i  zw  18 .",
    "it is an @xmath10-element produced mainly by sne  ii , but behaves differently from o and ar ( see   8.1 ) .",
    "for example , si is depleted onto dust grains in studies of the local ism , while ar and o are non - refractory ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) have , however , found that si / o is constant with o / h in their sample of bcds , and claimed that the similarity of this plateau with the solar value is evidence of no depletion in the h  ii regions .",
    "silicon is also more affected by ionization corrections than o and ar , since si  ii is the majority species in intervening h  ii gas as well . moreover ,",
    "a small amount of silicon is produced by sne  ia ( matteucci , molaro , & vladilo 1997 ) , at variance with the other @xmath10-elements considered in our analysis .",
    "the silicon abundance in the neutral gas of i  zw  18 is similar to the oxygen one . on the other hand , si in the h  ii regions is lower than the other @xmath10-elements .",
    "two interpretations are possible to explain these observations : _",
    "i ) _ the si value in the ionized gas is higher than estimated ; _ ii ) _ si is depleted in the h  ii regions , and as a consequence in the neutral gas as well ; however , no depletion is noticed in the neutral ism because ionization is important for si  ii or some contribution from sne  ia is present . in general ,",
    "silicon tracks very well the other @xmath10-elements o and s , so that o / si @xmath21 s / si @xmath21 0 ( indicative of the same sne  ii origin ) .",
    "this is , e.g. , what is observed in dwarf star - forming galaxies ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) and dlas ( prochaska & wolfe 1999 ; vladilo et al .",
    "thus , the first interpretation is probably the one to prefer since [ o / si ] = + 0.03 @xmath9 0.30 in the neutral ism of i  zw  18 .    summarizing , the chemical evolutionary history of i  zw  18 suggests that the galaxy has experienced at least two star - formation events .",
    "ancient activity ( one or more star - formation episodes ) is responsible for the metal enrichment of the h  i gaseous component .",
    "the imprinting of the chemical elements produced by sne  ia is clearly detectable in this component , as inferred by the o / fe ratio .",
    "a probable age of at least @xmath24 1 gyr can be inferred for this ancient star - formation event .",
    "more recent activity is instead accountable for the higher metal content in the h  ii regions .",
    "it is more difficult to confine in time the extension of this stellar production .",
    "however , some constraints arise from the abundance patterns in the neutral and ionized gas . according to our findings",
    ", this event must be younger than @xmath24 1 gyr ( no additional fe enrichment in the h  ii regions ) , but old enough to have enriched the gas in the central optical portion of the galaxy with primary nitrogen .",
    "this minimum age is 10 myr or a few hundred myr , depending on the source of primary nitrogen ( massive or intermediate - mass stars ) .",
    "the scenario of a few hundred myr is favored from considerations of time scales of mixing processes in the ism .",
    "we have presented our analysis of the interstellar spectrum of i  zw  18 , the most metal - poor star - forming galaxy in the local universe . the new @xmath0 observations , with a spectral resolution of @xmath24 35 km s@xmath15 , have higher s / n and better coverage of the wavelength region 900@xmath21200    than previous observations .",
    "our main findings are as follows .",
    "we have studied the absorption lines of the h  i lyman series from ly  @xmath63 to ly  @xmath65 .",
    "these lines are narrow in shape suggesting a purely interstellar origin , with no significant stellar contamination .",
    "a column density of @xmath3 @xmath4 is inferred for h  i in i  zw  18 by a multi - component fitting technique",
    "no h@xmath8 lines are detected in i  zw  18 .",
    "we have set a conservative @xmath5 upper limit of 5.25@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath4 for the total column density of diffuse h@xmath8 .",
    "this very low limit does not exclude the possible presence of clumpy h@xmath8 in dusty compact star - forming regions that are opaque to far - uv radiation .",
    "many interstellar absorption lines of neutral and singly ionized atoms of heavy elements have been detected and analyzed .",
    "fe  ii is the ion with the best column density constraint which is based on 9 lines with different oscillator strengths .",
    "column density determinations of other ions , o  i , si  ii , ar  i , and n  i , have also been made .",
    "\\4 . from the kinematics of the absorption lines",
    ", there is no clear evidence of gas infall / outflow over the large region sampled by @xmath0 .",
    "all the lines are centered at a velocity consistent with the systemic velocity of the galaxy as inferred by its stellar component ( @xmath60=761 @xmath9 9 km s@xmath15 ) .",
    "the single- or two - velocity component models used in the multi - component fitting technique have turned out to be a quite good representation of the data when compared to the column densities inferred with the optical depth method .",
    "the `` effective '' doppler width of the different ions is around 20 km s@xmath15 , similar to our instrumental broadening .",
    "we have inferred the following abundances of heavy elements : [ fe / h ] = @xmath21.76 @xmath9 0.12 , [ o / h ] = @xmath22.06 @xmath9 0.28 , [ si / h ] = @xmath22.09 @xmath9 0.12 , [ ar / h ] = @xmath22.27 @xmath9 0.13 , and [ n / h ] = @xmath22.88 @xmath9 0.11 . ionization and dust depletion corrections have been considered and should be small .",
    "the neutral ism in i  zw  18 has thus been enriched in metals by a certain amount of star - formation .",
    "a direct comparison of metal abundances in the neutral and ionized gas of i  zw  18 indicates that the @xmath10-elements ( o , ar , and si ) and n are several times lower in the neutral ism , while the fe content is the same within the errors .",
    "this suggests that the h  ii regions have been enriched by additional star - formation .",
    "the analysis of the abundance ratios o / fe , n / o and o / si and simple considerations of gas mixing , have allowed us to put some constraints on the chemical evolutionary history of i  zw  18 .",
    "it seems highly plausible that this galaxy has experienced two separate star - formation events .",
    "ancient star - formation activity ( one or more episodes ) is responsible for the metal enrichment of the h  i gas with the products typical of sne  ia .",
    "an age of at least @xmath24 1 gyr can thus be inferred .",
    "we estimated that the number of sne  ia required to produce the fe content in the neutral ism is @xmath24 470 .",
    "it is more difficult to confine in time the extension of the more recent star - formation activity responsible for the higher metal content in the h  ii regions . if primary",
    "n is released by intermediate - mass ( metal - poor massive ) stars , then the enrichment requires several hundred myr ( 10 myr ) .",
    "the older age seems to be preferred by typical time scales related to mixing processes .",
    "in either case , the time scales are longer than the typical lifetime of h  ii regions ( @xmath12 10 myr ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the simple scenario we inferred from the abundance patterns in the different gaseous components of i  zw  18 , is consistent with the star - formation history derived for this galaxy from the optical / nir color - magnitude diagrams of its resolved stellar population ( aloisi et al .",
    "1999 ; stlin 2000 ) .",
    "these diagrams revealed for the first time the existence of single stars with ages around 1 gyr , and the study presented in this paper seems to suggest the detection of their chemical imprinting in the neutral ism of the galaxy .",
    "we can conclude that i  zw  18 seems to be a dwarf star - forming galaxy which has substained a stellar - production activity for quite a long time , despite its very low metallicity .",
    "this activity has probably occurred with a low star - formation rate and/or relatively long quiescent periods .",
    "hence , i  zw  18 is just a relatively old galaxy with a very slow chemical evolution .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with the recent findings that all star - forming dwarf galaxies resolved into single stars show a stellar production that has gone on for quite a large fraction of a hubble time with a so - called `` gasping '' star - formation regime ( tosi 2001 ) .",
