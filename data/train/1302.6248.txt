    "in a quantum many - body system at zero temperature , topological order may arise when a gapped ground state possesses long - range entanglement that can not be detected by any local measurement or local order parameter  @xcite .",
    "ground state properties of topologically ordered systems are stable against any types of local perturbations , regardless of symmetries of perturbations , and depend only on global properties of geometric manifolds on which the whole systems are supported  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of topological order , such as fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite , came as a great surprise as it was beyond description of the landau - ginzburg theory which was once believed to be _ the _ ultimate theory of a quantum many - body system ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is now widely believed that the notion of topological order is essential in understanding the emergence of _ quantum phases with no local order _ in gapped quantum spin liquids , as seen in some resonating valence - bond states of frustrated anti - ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "in addition to fundamental importance in condensed matter physics , the study of topologically ordered systems is of practical importance since they are physically natural platforms for realizations of fault - tolerant quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "searches for novel topological phases and their classification in a variety of theoretical and experimental systems have been an active area of research .    for topologically ordered spin liquids with discrete gauge symmetries ,",
    "their low energy behavior is relatively well understood on a formal level as they can be effectively described by topological quantum field theory ( tqft )  @xcite , a field theory with an invariance under continuous deformations ( diffeomorphism )  @xcite .",
    "this is due to an observation that physical properties of topologically ordered systems do not depend on local structures of the systems , and topological properties of geometric manifolds play a crucial role in classifying topological phases .",
    "indeed , a fairly complete class of two - dimensional tqft - based spin systems with non - chiral topological order has been proposed by levin and wen where condensation of highly - fluctuating extended objects , called `` string - nets '' , are responsible for emergence of topological order  @xcite .",
    "a different , but closely related approach based on renormalization group ( rg ) ansatz of ground state wave - functions at fixed points has further verified the validity of tqft as effective theory of topological phases in the presence of continuous scale invariance  @xcite .    yet , in some cases , quantum spin liquids may exhibit topological order that is beyond description of tqft .",
    "for example , in three spatial dimensions , the cubic code , recently proposed by haah  @xcite , possesses topological order with the stability against local perturbations , but seems to exhibit physical properties that are completely different from those of conventional topological spin liquids . for one thing ,",
    "the number of degenerate ground states is exponential in the linear length of the lattice .",
    "furthermore , unlike string - net condensates , the model is free from string - like extended objects , and the mobility of quasi - particle excitations is highly constrained via some algebraic rules .",
    "it has been argued that these exotic features are particularly useful for storing quantum bits ( qubits ) securely in thermal environment , but with some subtlety pointed out due to its thermal instability at non - zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the cubic code and relevant models  @xcite clearly indicates that classification of topological phases via tqft is incomplete ; tqft is just a subset of some universal theory of topological order which is yet to be found .",
    "the necessary first step is to find a family of topological spin liquids that are beyond tqft , and to develop a general theoretical framework to discuss their physical properties in a unified way .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a large class of exactly solvable topological spin liquids on a three - dimensional lattice which possess exotic topological order that can not be described by tqft . instead of string - like ( one - dimensional ) or membrane - like ( two - dimensional ) objects with continuous geometries , ground states of the model are condensation of extended objects with non - integer dimensionality , namely _",

    "physical properties of classical fractal liquids are intrinsically akin to those of a black hole since inner states are completely determined by degrees of freedom on a one - dimensional surface , and their coding properties obey an `` area law '' asymptotically  @xcite .",
    "such exotic features of classical fractal liquids indicate a possibility of novel quantum phases that can not be described by a field theory with continuous scale invariance .",
    "construction of quantum fractal liquids can be viewed as natural generalization of classical fractal liquids to a quantum setting .",
    "we first present a physical picture of quantum fractal liquids in section  [ sec : symmetry ] by reviewing how condensation of extended objects emerge in topological spin liquids .",
    "in conventional topological spin liquids described by tqft , extended objects with continuous geometries and integer dimensionality may emerge from underlying discrete gauge symmetries  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , quantum fractal liquids are condensation of fractal objects with discrete geometries and non - integer dimensionality which emerge from certain algebraic symmetries",

    "geometric shapes of symmetry operators can be used as `` order parameters '' for classifying quantum phases where discontinuity in quantum phase transition is triggered by non - analytic changes of topologically distinct logical operators .",

    "it is shown that quantum fractal liquids are topologically ordered with stability against local perturbations , but are beyond tqft .",
    "we then discuss algebraic properties of quasi - particle excitations and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for quantum fractal liquids to be free from string - like logical operators .",
    "several examples of quantum fractal liquids are also studied . in particular , the cubic code is shown to be unitarily equivalent to a certain model of quantum fractal liquids , which we call a second - order model .    in section  [ sec : entangle ] , we compute topological entanglement entropies of quantum fractal liquids to establish connection between ground state and excitation properties .",
    "we demonstrate that topological entanglement entropies defined for tube - like regions can distinguish quantum fractal liquids from conventional topologically ordered systems .",

    "technical tools to analyze a family of translation symmetric stabilizer hamiltonians are presented in appendix  [ append ] which may be of independent interest .    some comments on the paper follow .",
    "we adopt the stability against local perturbations as the definition of topological order . by tqft , we mean an axiomatic formulation by atiyah which admits only a finite number of degenerate ground states  @xcite . for a review of tqft ,",
    "see  @xcite . by topological spin liquids , we mean gapped spin systems without local symmetries , i.e. topologically ordered spin systems .",

    "the following is a ground state : @xmath18 .",
    "the normalization factor is omitted .",
    "it is a superposition of terms @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath12 is a product of pauli-@xmath6 operators , it flips the signs of qubits : @xmath20 .",
    "then a term @xmath21 can be viewed as a state with one small loop on a `` dual lattice '' , and a term @xmath22 with neighboring stars @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a state with a larger loop ( fig .",

    "a ground state is a superposition of all the loop states ( fig .",

    "one can construct a general quantum many - body system with several types of strings constrained by discrete gauge symmetry .",
    "levin and wen derived the most general form of wave - functions that are represented as condensation of string - like extended objects on a two - dimensional lattice by further assuming that wave - functions possess _ scale invariance _ and correspond to fixed - points of rg transformations  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a ground state of @xmath2 spin liquid has scale invariance as it is a superposition of loops of all the different sizes and shapes .",
    "note that scale invariance is required for systems described by tqft since they must be invariant under continuous deformations . yet",
    ", scale invariance is not a necessary condition for the presence of topological order . as we will see",
    ", quantum fractal liquids do not have full continuous scale symmetries .",
    "instead , they have _ discrete scale symmetries _ where systems are invariant only under a limited set of scale transformations and ground states correspond to limit cycles of rg transformations .    geometric properties of extended - objects can be characterized by topological properties of global symmetry operators .",

    "since non - trivial symmetry operators commute with the hamiltonian , they do not change the energy of the system . yet , they can not be written as products of @xmath12 or @xmath13 and transform degenerate ground states into each other .",

    "similarly , @xmath33 is condensation of loops with non - trivial winding in the @xmath34 direction .",
    "four degenerate ground states may be indexed by winding numbers as @xmath35 with @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the presence or absence of windings in the @xmath32 and @xmath34 directions respectively",

    "this is the origin of the stability against local perturbations in topological phases from quantum information perspective  @xcite .",
    "another useful way of revealing topological properties of @xmath2 spin liquid is to consider its _",

    "then a system consists of a pair of non - interacting ferromagnets in the @xmath32 direction .",
    "similarly , one obtains another pair of non - interacting ferromagnets by shrinking the @xmath32 axis .",
    "therefore , two - dimensional @xmath2 spin liquid can be constructed by weaving one - dimensional ferromagnets coherently such that its one - dimensional holographic images are ferromagnets .",

    "in general , for a quantum many - body system described by tqft , extended objects ( wilson loops or surfaces ) have continuous geometries with integer dimensionality . in fact , the dimensional duality of non - trivial symmetry operators is a consequence of the poincar duality for systems described by tqft and can be derived analytically from continuous deformability of logical operators as shown in  @xcite .",

    "the model does not have power law decay of two - point correlation functions as observed in conventional classical spin liquids .",
    "instead , we point out that it has an oscillatory power - law behavior with imaginary scaling dimensions , exhibiting _ discrete scale symmetries_. consider the following three - point correlation function : @xmath62 in the ground space manifold , @xmath63 is @xmath64 with oscillatory behaviors in @xmath65 , instead of @xmath66 . at finite temperature ,",
    "the three - point correlation function reads @xmath67 with @xmath68 where the exponent has a peculiar dependence on a fractal dimension .",
    "the correlation function for all @xmath66 is @xmath69 where oscillatory behaviors in @xmath65 are represented by power law with imaginary scaling dimensions , which is characteristic of systems with discrete scale symmetries  @xcite .",
    "geometric properties of degenerate ground states in the sierpinski triangle model can be captured by geometric shapes of logical operators : @xmath70 where they commute with all the interaction terms , but can not be represented as products of interaction terms .",
    "so , it has the following pairs of logical operators : @xmath71 while the model has a fractal logical operator , a ground state does not have any quantum fluctuation , and is not topologically ordered since its partner is a trivial logical operator with zero - dimensional geometry . to have topological order",
    ", both logical operators must have topologically non - trivial geometries ( i.e. they must be finite - dimensional ) .    given the large scope of theory of fractal geometries , it is natural to wonder if fluctuations of fractal objects can describe general topologically ordered quantum systems that are beyond descriptions of tqft . in the reminder of the paper , we present a large class of quantum spin systems with fractal liquid order and analyze its physical properties .",
    "in particular , we construct a model of quantum spin systems which has pairs of anti - commuting fractal logical operators : @xmath72 by combining features of both @xmath2 spin liquid and classical fractal liquids .",
