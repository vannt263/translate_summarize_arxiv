    "extreme events are typically associated with disasters of some kind or other , e.g. , droughts , cold wave , cyclones , earthquakes , wind gusts and economic recession . when a relevant variable , such as the wind speed @xmath0 recorded at time @xmath1 in the case of wind gusts , exceeds certain prescribed threshold @xmath2 due to its inherent fluctuations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath3 , then it is taken to be an extreme event . in particular , it is important to note that the magnitude of tremor , wind speed , temperature , economic growth etc .",
    "are scalar variables .",
    "a large number of results , both theoretical and empirical , are known about the statistics and dynamics of extreme events for such univariate , scalar variables @xcite .",
    "one significant result due to classical extreme value theory is that , depending on the probability distribution function of the variable , the distribution of block maxima , for the uncorrelated sequence of random variables , converges to only one of the three possible forms , namely , frchet , gumbel and weibull distributions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this scenario , extreme events can also take place on complex networks .",
    "consider , for instance , the most common experience of web surfers ; a web server not responding due to the heavy load of http requests .",
    "this is an extreme event taking place on the network of world wide web .",
    "for example , the popular social networking site twitter handled about 600 tweets per second in early 2010 @xcite . according to an industry estimate ,",
    "the google search engine received approximately 34000 search requests per second by the end of 2009 @xcite . for most websites on the world wide web that are unprepared for such a large number of http requests",
    ", these numbers would represent extreme events and could potentially disrupt the service .",
    "the power black - out in the north eastern united states in 2003 is also an example of extreme event on the power transmission grid network .",
    "the cascading failures shut down more than 508 power generating units at 265 power plants during the peak of this black - out@xcite .",
    "grid locks in highways is an example of extreme event on transportation network . from the point of view of physics ,",
    "all these events could be thought of as an emergent phenomena arising due to flux on the networks and could be regarded as extreme events arising primarily due to limited handling capacity of the node .",
    "transport on the networks continues to be widely studied but much less attention has been focused on it from the point of view of extreme events .",
    "generally , when the flux ( packets of information or power or highway traffic , in the case of examples given above ) exceeds the handling capacity , it turns out to be an extreme event for the particular node on the network . in the earlier works related to congestion and cascade on networks @xcite",
    ", handling capacity is a key ingredient that needs to be prescribed upfront .",
    "however , extreme events happen not only because of the limited handling capacity of the node on a network but also because of inherent fluctuations in the flux passing through the node",
    ". these fluctuations in the flux passing through a node could be so large as they breach a prescribed threshold , in which case , we label the event as an extreme event for the node .",
    "this definition of extreme event for a node on any network is similar in spirit to that of the classical extreme value theory .",
    "then , a relevant question is how the connectivity of the network affects the probability for extreme event occurrence . by modeling the transport as standard random walks on networks ,",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the probability for the occurrence of extreme events @xmath4 , arising due to inherent fluctuations , depends only on the degree @xmath5 of the @xmath6-th node in question . in this work , the threshold @xmath7 was chosen to be proportional to typical fluctuation size on @xmath6-th node .",
    "thus , the extreme events are identified after taking care of the natural variability of the flux passing through the given node .",
    "further , it was shown that , on average @xmath8 is higher for small degree nodes than for hubs .",
    "this is a surprising result because it implies that , within the framework of random walk on networks , even though hubs attract large flux ( compared to small degree nodes ) they are less prone to extreme events .",
    "thus , in the context of a node on a connected network , larger flux does not necessarily translate into higher probabilities for extreme events .",
    "this feature is one possible signature of connectivity , _",
    "i.e. _ , the network setting on which the system operates .",
    "in contrast , for a scalar time series @xmath0 larger flux would imply higher extreme event probabilities .",
    "random walk on complex networks is a useful fundamental model against which to compare other transport processes .",
    "most realistic transport phenomena on networks , such as the flux of information packets passing through the network of routers or road traffic , do not proceed by performing random walk . in order to model the flux in a more realistic way , it is useful to generalize the standard random walk to a situation in which the flux is either biased toward hubs or small degree nodes .",
    "for example , consider the case of two remote airports which are not directly connected by flights .",
    "typically , they would be connected through a major hub on the airline network .",
    "this is one practical scenario in which the traffic is biased toward the hubs .",
    "this happens in many a network settings ; railways tend to connect the hinterland with the hubs , phones connect to nearest hubs on the network .",
    "motivated by these physical examples , in this work , we model the transport process as random walks biased by the topology of the network and study the extreme event probabilities and event - size distributions .",
    "we show that biased random walk leads to extreme fluctuations in the event sizes on the network . in the subsequent sections",
    ", we discuss the topologically biased random walk model on a network and obtain analytical results for the probability of occurrence of extreme events on any node .",
    "we show that the analytical and simulation results are in good agreement .",
    "we consider a connected , undirected , finite network with @xmath9 nodes and @xmath10 edges .",
    "the network is characterized by a symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath11 with elements @xmath12 if nodes @xmath6 and @xmath13 are connected by an edge and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "there are @xmath15 independent walkers performing biased random walk on this network in the sense explained below .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the transition probability for a walker to hop from node @xmath6 to a neighboring node @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the probability that a walker starting at the node @xmath6 at time @xmath18 is at node @xmath13 at time @xmath19 .",
    "then , the master equation can be written as @xmath20 the random walkers are biased by taking the time - independent transition probability for hopping from @xmath21-th to @xmath13-th node to be @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a parameter that defines the degree of bias imparted to the walkers .",
    "clearly , @xmath24 corresponds to the standard random walk and the transition probability is unbiased , where the walker can hop to any of the neighboring node with equal probability . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the random walkers are biased toward nodes with larger degree or hubs .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath26 , walkers preferentially hop to small degree nodes .",
    "the larger ( smaller ) the @xmath23 , stronger the bias toward the hubs ( small degree nodes ) is .",
    "then , the normalized transition probability becomes @xmath27 the summation in the denominator runs over the nearest neighbors of node @xmath21 . using the transition probability in eq.[biasing ] , the master equation becomes @xmath28 by repeated iteration of eq .",
    "[ master1 ] , it can be shown that @xmath29 , as @xmath30 leads to the stationary distribution @xmath31 we can define the generalized strength of @xmath13 th node to be @xmath32 which is a measure of the ability of a node to attract walkers .",
    "note that @xmath33 depends on the bias parameter @xmath23 and the degree of the nearest neighbors to which it is connected by an edge .",
    "hence , it is possible for the nodes with same degree to have different generalized strengths .",
    "thus , the generalized strength of the node is independent of the global network structure but is dependent on the local connectivity structure around the node .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of standard random walk ( on networks ) in which large - scale structure of the network topology plays no significant role .",
    "the local network structure is important for biased random walks on networks . in fig .",
    "[ k_vs_phi ] , we show how the generalized strength @xmath34 depends on the degree of a node , for several values of @xmath23 , in a scale - free network with degree exponent @xmath35 . for @xmath36 ( crosses in fig . [ k_vs_phi ] ) , the generalized strength of a node is higher for large degree nodes ( hubs ) and an approximate linear relation is seen between @xmath37 and @xmath5 of @xmath6-th node . for @xmath24 , which is the standard random walk case , the generalized strength of the node is the same as the degree of the node ( solid circles in fig .",
    "[ k_vs_phi ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath38 , @xmath34 is independent of @xmath39 especially for large degree nodes ( triangles in fig . [ k_vs_phi ] ) . in this case , the bias in the random walk represented by its generalized strength @xmath34 is balanced by the degree of the node . in a scale - free network ,",
    "a large number of small degree nodes are present and they do not have identical values for the generalized strength @xmath34 . this explains the spread in @xmath34 for all values for @xmath40 . upon further decrease in the bias parameter @xmath23 below -1.0 ( open squares in fig .",
    "[ k_vs_phi ] ) , nodes with a smaller degree or neighbors with smaller degree become important and the generalized strength decreases with increasing degree .     as a function of degree @xmath39 for different values of @xmath23 in log - log plot.,width=307 ]      the stationary distribution for the number of walkers in @xmath13-th node can be rewritten in terms of the generalized strength @xmath34 as @xmath41 thus , every node can be uniquely characterized by its generalized strength @xmath34 .",
    "it is expected that two nodes with the same value of @xmath34 show similar behavior as far as biased walks on networks based on eq .",
    "[ bias ] are concerned . in case of @xmath24",
    ", we get @xmath42 and the stationary distribution simplifies to @xmath43 , the result obtained for the case of standard random walk in ref .",
    "thus , in the case of a standard random walk , the degree @xmath39 characterises the node .",
    "in the case of uncorrelated random networks , the stationary occupation probability can be further simplified by using the mean field approximation and can be written as @xcite @xmath44 this approximate result suggests that the nodes with the same degree should have the identical transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "this does not necessarily hold well for the nodes of correlated networks such as the scale - free networks .",
    "this is because in a scale - free network , the neighbourhood of nodes with identical degree are not identical .",
    "hence , to study extreme events we use eq . [ statdist ] instead of eq .",
    "[ fronc ] .    given",
    "[ statdist ] gives the probability to find one walker on @xmath6-th node with generalized strength @xmath37 , we can now obtain the distribution of random walkers on @xmath6-th node .",
    "the formulation is applicable to any node on the network and hence , in our further discussions , we suppress the index @xmath6 of the node .",
    "random walkers are independent and non - interacting and hence the probability @xmath45 of finding @xmath46 walkers on a node is @xmath47 while the rest of the walkers , @xmath48 are distributed on the rest of the nodes of the network .",
    "when properly normalized , this leads to a binomial distribution given by @xmath49 the mean and variance of the flux passing through the given node is @xmath50 note that the results in eqs .",
    "[ binomial ] and [ meanvar ] depend only on the generalized strength @xmath34 that characterises a node including its neighbourhood .",

    "this relation can be thought of as a generalization of a similar relation for the unbiased random walks reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the exponent @xmath53 is not universal and instead depends on details such as the fluctuation in number of walkers and sampling resolution of the flux @xcite .",

    "we take an extreme event to be the one for which the probability of occurrence is small and is typically associated with the tail of the probability distribution function for the events .",
    "we extend this principle to the events on the nodes of a network @xcite .",
    "given that the number of walkers @xmath46 passing through a node with generalized strength @xmath34 follow the binomial distribution , if more than @xmath2 walkers pass through the node , then it is an extreme event for the node .",
    "then , the probability for the occurrence of extreme event is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the floor function defined as the largest integer not greater than @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the standard incomplete beta function @xcite . in this form ,",

    "if we set @xmath64 , then we obtain @xmath65 since @xmath66 , we get @xmath67 for all the nodes implying that there are no extreme events anywhere in the network . hence , these choices of threshold values are not physically interesting cases .",
    "any other arbitrary choice such as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a constant , will predominantly lead to some nodes encountering extreme events nearly all the time and others having no events at all .",

    "an unusual feature is that @xmath77 predicts higher probability of occurrence of extreme events , on average , for nodes with small values of generalized strength @xmath34 than for the nodes with higher values of generalized strength @xmath34 .",

    "it can be explained as follows ; when @xmath116 , the flux preferentially flows through the small degree nodes which form the bulk in a scale - free network .",
    "most small degree nodes do not have a direct link with other small degree nodes but are connected through a hub .",

    "this is one possible signature of the topologically biased flow in a scale - free network .    in general ,",

    "various kind of biases based on the local environment , shortest paths , the entropy of random walk and various adaptive strategies are some examples of biased random walk on networks @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to study the extreme event probabilities under such biasing strategies .",

    "apart from being responsible for providing better connectivity , existence of hubs makes the scale - free network robust against the random node removal but fragile if the node removal is targeted @xcite . the results in this paper show that extreme events due to natural fluctuations are more probable on small degree nodes ( when compared to the hubs ) .",
    "hence special attention must be paid to designing the capacity of the small degree nodes so that extreme events can be smoothly handled without leading to disruption of the node .",
    "the results in this paper can be used to estimate the capacity a node should possess if it should handle extreme events of size , say , @xmath92 .",
    "if we want the node to handle @xmath119 events smoothly , then the required capacity can be obtained by inverting eq .",

    "<S> random walk on discrete lattice models is important to understand various types of transport processes . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme events , defined as exceedences of the flux of walkers above a prescribed threshold , have been studied recently in the context of complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> this was motivated by the occurrence of rare events such as traffic jams , floods , and power black - outs which take place on networks . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we study extreme events in a generalized random walk model in which the walk is preferentially biased by the network topology . </S>",
    "<S> the walkers preferentially choose to hop toward the hubs or small degree nodes . in this setting </S>",
    "<S> , we show that extremely large fluctuations in event - sizes are possible on small degree nodes when the walkers are biased toward the hubs . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we obtain the distribution of event - sizes on the network . </S>",
    "<S> further , the probability for the occurrence of extreme events on any node in the network depends on its generalized strength , a measure of the ability of a node to attract walkers . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized strength is a function of the degree of the node and that of its nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain analytical and simulation results for the probability of occurrence of extreme events on the nodes of a network using a generalized random walk model . </S>",
    "<S> the result reveals that the nodes with a larger value of generalized strength , on average , display lower probability for the occurrence of extreme events compared to the nodes with lower values of generalized strength. </S>"
